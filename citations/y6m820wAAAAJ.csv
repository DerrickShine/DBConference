Computing with spatial trajectories,Yu Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,Spatial trajectories have been bringing the unprecedented wealth to a variety of researchcommunities. A spatial trajectory records the paths of a variety of moving objects; such aspeople who log their travel routes with GPS trajectories. The field of moving objects relatedresearch has become extremely active within the last few years; especially with all majordatabase and data mining conferences and journals. Computing with Spatial Trajectoriesintroduces the algorithms; technologies; and systems used to process; manage andunderstand existing spatial trajectories for different applications. This book also presents anoverview on both fundamentals and the state-of-the-art research inspired by spatialtrajectory data; as well as a special focus on trajectory pattern mining; spatio-temporal datamining and location-based social networks.

Discovery of convoys in trajectory databases,Hoyoung Jeung; Man Lung Yiu; Xiaofang Zhou; Christian S Jensen; Heng Tao Shen,Abstract As mobile devices with positioning capabilities continue to proliferate; datamanagement for so-called trajectory databases that capture the historical movements ofpopulations of moving objects becomes important. This paper considers the querying ofsuch databases for convoys; a convoy being a group of objects that have traveled togetherfor some time. More specifically; this paper formalizes the concept of a convoy query usingdensity-based notions; in order to capture groups of arbitrary extents and shapes. Convoydiscovery is relevant for real-life applications in throughput planning of trucks and carpoolingof vehicles. Although there has been extensive research on trajectories in the literature;none of this can be applied to retrieve correctly exact convoy result sets. Motivated by this;we develop three efficient algorithms for convoy discovery that adopt the well-known filter …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,381
Spark: top-k keyword query in relational databases,Yi Luo; Xuemin Lin; Wei Wang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract With the increasing amount of text data stored in relational databases; there is ademand for RDBMS to support keyword queries over text data. As a search result is oftenassembled from multiple relational tables; traditional IR-style ranking and query evaluationmethods cannot be applied directly. In this paper; we study the effectiveness and theefficiency issues of answering top-k keyword query in relational database systems. Wepropose a new ranking formula by adapting existing IR techniques based on a naturalnotion of virtual document. Compared with previous approaches; our new ranking method issimple yet effective; and agrees with human perceptions. We also study efficient queryprocessing methods for the new ranking method; and propose algorithms that have minimalaccesses to the database.

l2; 1-norm regularized discriminative feature selection for unsupervised learning,Yi Yang; Heng Tao Shen; Zhigang Ma; Zi Huang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Compared with supervised learning for feature selection; it is much more difficult toselect the discriminative features in unsupervised learning due to the lack of labelinformation. Traditional unsupervised feature selection algorithms usually select the featureswhich best preserve the data distribution; eg; manifold structure; of the whole feature set.Under the assumption that the class label of input data can be predicted by a linearclassifier; we incorporate discriminative analysis and l2; 1-norm minimization into a jointframework for unsupervised feature selection. Different from existing unsupervised featureselection algorithms; our algorithm selects the most discriminative feature subset from thewhole feature set in batch mode. Extensive experiment on different data types demonstratesthe effectiveness of our algorithm.,IJCAI proceedings-international joint conference on artificial intelligence,2011,321
A hybrid prediction model for moving objects,Hoyoung Jeung; Qing Liu; Heng Tao Shen; Xiaofang Zhou,Existing prediction methods in moving objects databases cannot forecast locationsaccurately if the query time is far away from the current time. Even for near future prediction;most techniques assume the trajectory of an object's movements can be represented bysome mathematical formulas of motion functions based on its recent movements. However;an object's movements are more complicated than what the mathematical formulas canrepresent. Prediction based on an object's trajectory patterns is a powerful way and hasbeen investigated by several work. But their main interest is how to discover the patterns. Inthis paper; we present a novel prediction approach; namely The Hybrid Prediction Model;which estimates an object's future locations based on its pattern information as well asexisting motion functions using the object's recent movements. Specifically; an object's …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,247
Discovering popular routes from trajectories,Zaiben Chen; Heng Tao Shen; Xiaofang Zhou,The booming industry of location-based services has accumulated a huge collection ofusers' location trajectories of driving; cycling; hiking; etc. In this work; we investigate theproblem of discovering the Most Popular Route (MPR) between two locations by observingthe traveling behaviors of many previous users. This new query is beneficial to travelers whoare asking directions or planning a trip in an unfamiliar city/area; as historical travelingexperiences can reveal how people usually choose routes between locations. To achievethis goal; we firstly develop a Coherence Expanding algorithm to retrieve a transfer networkfrom raw trajectories; for indicating all the possible movements between locations. After that;the Absorbing Markov Chain model is applied to derive a reasonable transfer probability foreach transfer node in the network; which is subsequently used as the popularity indicator …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,236
Multi-source skyline query processing in road networks,Ke Deng; Xiaofang Zhou; Heng Tao,Skyline query processing has been investigated extensively in recent years; mostly for onlyone query reference point. An example of a single-source skyline query is to find hotelswhich are cheap and close to the beach (an absolute query); or close to a user-givenlocation (a relatively query). A multi-source skyline query considers several query points atthe same time (eg; to find hotels which are cheap and close to the University; the BotanicGarden and the China Town). In this paper; we consider the problem of efficient multi-sourceskyline query processing in road networks. It is not only the first effort to consider multi-source skyline query in road networks but also the first effort to process the relative skylinequeries where the network distance between two locations needs to be computed on-the-fly.Three different query processing algorithms are proposed and evaluated in this paper …,Data Engineering; 2007.

Unsupervised feature selection using nonnegative spectral analysis.,Zechao Li; Yi Yang; Jing Liu; Xiaofang Zhou; Hanqing Lu,Abstract In this paper; a new unsupervised learning algorithm; namely NonnegativeDiscriminative Feature Selection (NDFS); is proposed. To exploit the discriminativeinformation in unsupervised scenarios; we perform spectral clustering to learn the clusterlabels of the input samples; during which the feature selection is performed simultaneously.The joint learning of the cluster labels and feature selection matrix enables NDFS to selectthe most discriminative features. To learn more accurate cluster labels; a nonnegativeconstraint is explicitly imposed to the class indicators. To reduce the redundant or evennoisy features; l2; 1-norm minimization constraint is added into the objective function; whichguarantees the feature selection matrix sparse in rows. Our algorithm exploits thediscriminative information and feature correlation simultaneously to select a better feature …,AAAI,2012,189
Searching trajectories by locations: an efficiency study,Zaiben Chen; Heng Tao Shen; Xiaofang Zhou; Yu Zheng; Xing Xie,Abstract Trajectory search has long been an attractive and challenging topic which bloomsvarious interesting applications in spatial-temporal databases. In this work; we study a newproblem of searching trajectories by locations; in which context the query is only a small setof locations with or without an order specified; while the target is to find the k Best-Connected Trajectories (k-BCT) from a database such that the k-BCT best connect thedesignated locations geographically. Different from the conventional trajectory search thatlooks for similar trajectories wrt shape or other criteria by using a sample query trajectory; wefocus on the goodness of connection provided by a trajectory to the specified querylocations. This new query can benefit users in many novel applications such as tripplanning. In our work; we firstly define a new similarity function for measuring how well a …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,154
Towards effective indexing for very large video sequence database,Heng Tao Shen; Beng Chin Ooi; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract With rapid advances in video processing technologies and ever fast increments innetwork bandwidth; the popularity of video content publishing and sharing has madesimilarity search an indispensable operation to retrieve videos of user interests. The videosimilarity is usually measured by the percentage of similar frames shared by two videosequences; and each frame is typically represented as a high-dimensional feature vector.Unfortunately; high complexity of video content has posed the following major challenges forfast retrieval:(a) effective and compact video representations;(b) efficient similaritymeasurements; and (c) efficient indexing on the compact representations. In this paper; wepropose a number of methods to achieve fast similarity search for very large video database.First; each video sequence is summarized into a small number of clusters; each of which …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,150
Clustering-guided sparse structural learning for unsupervised feature selection,Zechao Li; Jing Liu; Yi Yang; Xiaofang Zhou; Hanqing Lu,Many pattern analysis and data mining problems have witnessed high-dimensional datarepresented by a large number of features; which are often redundant and noisy. Featureselection is one main technique for dimensionality reduction that involves identifying asubset of the most useful features. In this paper; a novel unsupervised feature selectionalgorithm; named clustering-guided sparse structural learning (CGSSL); is proposed byintegrating cluster analysis and sparse structural analysis into a joint framework andexperimentally evaluated.

Path prediction and predictive range querying in road network databases,Hoyoung Jeung; Man Lung Yiu; Xiaofang Zhou; Christian S Jensen,Abstract In automotive applications; movement-path prediction enables the delivery ofpredictive and relevant services to drivers; eg; reporting traffic conditions and gas stationsalong the route ahead. Path prediction also enables better results of predictive rangequeries and reduces the location update frequency in vehicle tracking while preservingaccuracy. Existing moving-object location prediction techniques in spatial-network settingslargely target short-term prediction that does not extend beyond the next road junction. To gobeyond short-term prediction; we formulate a network mobility model that offers a conciserepresentation of mobility statistics extracted from massive collections of historical objecttrajectories. The model aims to capture the turning patterns at junctions and the travelspeeds on road segments at the level of individual objects. Based on the mobility model …,The VLDB Journal,2010,120
Genetic algorithm based QoS-aware service compositions in cloud computing,Zhen Ye; Xiaofang Zhou; Athman Bouguettaya,Abstract Services in cloud computing can be categorized into two groups: Applicationservices and Utility Computing Services. Compositions in the application level are similar tothe Web service compositions in SOC (Service-Oriented Computing). Compositions in theutility level are similar to the task matching and scheduling in grid computing. Contributionsof this paper include: 1) An extensible QoS model is proposed to calculate the QoS values ofservices in cloud computing. 2) A genetic-algorithm-based approach is proposed tocompose services in cloud computing. 3) A comparison is presented between the proposedapproach and other algorithms; ie; exhaustive search algorithms and random selectionalgorithms.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2011,112
Infrared patch-image model for small target detection in a single image,Chenqiang Gao; Deyu Meng; Yi Yang; Yongtao Wang; Xiaofang Zhou; Alexander G Hauptmann,The robust detection of small targets is one of the key techniques in infrared search andtracking applications. A novel small target detection method in a single infrared image isproposed in this paper. Initially; the traditional infrared image model is generalized to a newinfrared patch-image model using local patch construction. Then; because of the non-localself-correlation property of the infrared background image; based on the new model smalltarget detection is formulated as an optimization problem of recovering low-rank and sparsematrices; which is effectively solved using stable principle component pursuit. Finally; asimple adaptive segmentation method is used to segment the target image and thesegmentation result can be refined by post-processing.

Reducing uncertainty of low-sampling-rate trajectories,Kai Zheng; Yu Zheng; Xing Xie; Xiaofang Zhou,The increasing availability of GPS-embedded mobile devices has given rise to a newspectrum of location-based services; which have accumulated a huge collection of locationtrajectories. In practice; a large portion of these trajectories are of low-sampling-rate. Forinstance; the time interval between consecutive GPS points of some trajectories can beseveral minutes or even hours. With such a low sampling rate; most details of theirmovement are lost; which makes them difficult to process effectively. In this work; weinvestigate how to reduce the uncertainty in such kind of trajectories. Specifically; given alow-sampling-rate trajectory; we aim to infer its possible routes. The methodology adopted inour work is to take full advantage of the rich information extracted from the historicaltrajectories. We propose a systematic solution; History based Route Inference System …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,108
Monitoring path nearest neighbor in road networks,Zaiben Chen; Heng Tao Shen; Xiaofang Zhou; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract This paper addresses the problem of monitoring the k nearest neighbors to adynamically changing path in road networks. Given a destination where a user is going to;this new query returns the k-NN with respect to the shortest path connecting the destinationand the user's current location; and thus provides a list of nearest candidates for referenceby considering the whole coming journey. We name this query the k-Path Nearest Neighborquery (k-PNN). As the user is moving and may not always follow the shortest path; the querypath keeps changing. The challenge of monitoring the k-PNN for an arbitrarily moving useris to dynamically determine the update locations and then refresh the k-PNN efficiently. Wepropose a three-phase Best-first Network Expansion (BNE) algorithm for monitoring the k-PNN and the corresponding shortest path. In the searching phase; the BNE finds the …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,96
Convoy queries in spatio-temporal databases,Hoyoung Jeung; Heng Tao Shen; Xiaofang Zhou,We introduce a convoy query that retrieves all convoys from historical trajectories; each ofwhich consists of a set of objects that travelled closely during a certain time period. Convoyquery is useful for many applications such as carpooling and traffic jam analysis; however;limited work has been done in the database community. This study proposes three efficientmethods for discovering convoys. The main novelty of our methods is to approximateoriginal trajectories by using line simplification methods and perform the discovery processover the simplified trajectories with bounded errors. Our experimental results confirm theeffectiveness and efficiency of our methods.,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,94
UQLIPS: a real-time near-duplicate video clip detection system,Heng Tao Shen; Xiaofang Zhou; Zi Huang; Jie Shao; Xiangmin Zhou,Abstract Near-duplicate video clip (NDVC) detection is an important problem with a widerange of applications such as TV broadcast monitoring; video copyright enforcement;content-based video clustering and annotation; etc. For a large database with tens ofthousands of video clips; each with thousands of frames; can NDVC search be performed inreal-time? In addition to considering inter-frame similarity (ie; spatial information); what is theimpact of frame sequence similarity (ie; temporal information) on search speed andaccuracy? UQLIPS is a prototype system for online NDVC detection. The core of UQLIPScomprises two novel complementary schemes for detecting NDVCs.

Probabilistic range queries for uncertain trajectories on road networks,Kai Zheng; Goce Trajcevski; Xiaofang Zhou; Peter Scheuermann,Abstract Trajectories representing the motion of moving objects are typically obtained vialocation sampling; eg using GPS or road-side sensors; at discrete time-instants. In-betweenconsecutive samples; nothing is known about the whereabouts of a given moving object.Various models have been proposed (eg; sheared cylinders; spacetime prisms) to representthe uncertainty of the moving objects both in unconstrained Euclidian space; as well as roadnetworks. In this paper; we focus on representing the uncertainty of the objects moving alongroad networks as time-dependent probability distribution functions; assuming availability of amaximal speed on each road segment. For these settings; we introduce a novel indexingmechanism--UTH (Uncertain Trajectories Hierarchy); based upon which efficient algorithmsfor processing spatio-temporal range queries are proposed.

Semisupervised feature selection via spline regression for video semantic recognition,Yahong Han; Yi Yang; Yan Yan; Zhigang Ma; Nicu Sebe; Xiaofang Zhou,To improve both the efficiency and accuracy of video semantic recognition; we can performfeature selection on the extracted video features to select a subset of features from the high-dimensional feature set for a compact and accurate video data representation. Provided thenumber of labeled videos is small; supervised feature selection could fail to identify therelevant features that are discriminative to target classes. In many applications; abundantunlabeled videos are easily accessible. This motivates us to develop semisupervisedfeature selection algorithms to better identify the relevant video features; which arediscriminative to target classes by effectively exploiting the information underlying the hugeamount of unlabeled video data. In this paper; we propose a framework of video semanticrecognition by semisupervised feature selection via spline regression (S 2 FS 2 R).

Automatic texture segmentation for texture-based image retrieval,Ying Liu; Xiaofang Zhou,Texture-segmentation is the crucial initial step for texture-based image retrieval. Texture isthe main difficulty faced to a segmentation method. Many image segmentation algorithmseither can't handle texture properly or cannot obtain texture features directly duringsegmentation which can be used for retrieval purpose. This paper describes an automatictexture segmentation algorithm based on a set of features derived from wavelet domain;which are effective in texture description for retrieval purpose. Simulation results show thatthe proposed algorithm can efficiently capture the textured regions in arbitrary images; withthe features of each region extracted as well. The features of each textured region can bedirectly used to index image database with applications as texture-based image retrieval.,Multimedia Modelling Conference; 2004.

Data partitioning for parallel spatial join processing,Xiaofang Zhou; David J Abel; David Truffet,Abstract The cost of spatial join processing can be very high because of the large sizes ofspatial objects and the computation-intensive spatial operations. While parallel processingseems a natural solution to this problem; it is not clear how spatial data can be partitioned forthis purpose. Various spatial data partitioning methods are examined in this paper. Aframework combining the data-partitioning techniques used by most parallel join algorithmsin relational databases and the filter-and-refine strategy for spatial operation processing isproposed for parallel spatial join processing. Object duplication caused by multi-assignmentin spatial data partitioning can result in extra CPU cost as well as extra communication cost.We find that the key to overcome this problem is to preserve spatial locality in taskdecomposition. In this paper we show that a near-optimal speedup can be achieved for …,Geoinformatica,1998,78
Efficient polygon amalgamation methods for spatial OLAP and spatial data mining,Xiaofang Zhou; David Truffet; Jiawei Han,Abstract The polygon amalgamation operation computes the boundary of the union of a setof polygons. This is an important operation for spatial on-line analytical processing andspatial data mining; where polygons representing different spatial objects often need to beamalgamated by varying criteria when the user wants to aggregate or reclassify theseobjects. The processing cost of this operation can be very high for a large number ofpolygons. Based on the observation that not all polygons to be amalgamated contribute tothe boundary; we investigate in this paper efficient polygon amalgamation methods byexcluding those internal polygons without retrieving them from the database. Two novelalgorithms; adjacency-based and occupancy-based; are proposed. While both algorithmscan reduce the amalgamation cost significantly; the occupancy-based algorithm is …,International Symposium on Spatial Databases,1999,67
Efficient parallel skyline processing using hyperplane projections,Henning Köhler; Jing Yang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract The skyline of a set of multi-dimensional points (tuples) consists of those points forwhich no clearly better point exists in the given set; using component-wise comparison ondomains of interest. Skyline queries; ie; queries that involve computation of a skyline; can becomputationally expensive; so it is natural to consider parallelized approaches which makegood use of multiple processors. We approach this problem by using hyperplane projectionsto obtain useful partitions of the data set for parallel processing. These partitions not onlyensure small local skyline sets; but enable efficient merging of results as well. Ourexperiments show that our method consistently outperforms similar approaches for parallelskyline computation; regardless of data distribution; and provides insights on the impacts ofdifferent optimization strategies.,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,65
Compound rank-$ k $ projections for bilinear analysis,Xiaojun Chang; Feiping Nie; Sen Wang; Yi Yang; Xiaofang Zhou; Chengqi Zhang,In many real-world applications; data are represented by matrices or high-order tensors.Despite the promising performance; the existing 2-D discriminant analysis algorithmsemploy a single projection model to exploit the discriminant information for projection;making the model less flexible. In this paper; we propose a novel compound rank-kprojection (CRP) algorithm for bilinear analysis. The CRP deals with matrices directlywithout transforming them into vectors; and it; therefore; preserves the correlations within thematrix and decreases the computation complexity. Different from the existing 2-Ddiscriminant analysis algorithms; objective function values of CRP increase monotonically.In addition; the CRP utilizes multiple rank-k projection models to enable a larger searchspace in which the optimal solution can be found. In this way; the discriminant ability is …,IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,2016,60
Online discovery of gathering patterns over trajectories,Kai Zheng; Yu Zheng; Nicholas J Yuan; Shuo Shang; Xiaofang Zhou,The increasing pervasiveness of location-acquisition technologies has enabled collection ofhuge amount of trajectories for almost any kind of moving objects. Discovering usefulpatterns from their movement behaviors can convey valuable knowledge to a variety ofcritical applications. In this light; we propose a novel concept; called gathering; which is atrajectory pattern modeling various group incidents such as celebrations; parades; protests;traffic jams and so on. A key observation is that these incidents typically involve largecongregations of individuals; which form durable and stable areas with high density. In thiswork; we first develop a set of novel techniques to tackle the challenge of efficient discoveryof gathering patterns on archived trajectory dataset.

Mining trajectory patterns using hidden Markov models,Hoyoung Jeung; Heng Tao Shen; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Many studies of spatiotemporal pattern discovery partition data space into disjointcells for effective processing. However; the discovery accuracy of the space-partitioningschemes highly depends on space granularity. Moreover; it cannot describe data statisticswell when data spreads over not only one but many cells. In this study; we introduce a novelapproach which takes advantages of the effectiveness of space-partitioning methods butovercomes those problems. Specifically; we uncover frequent regions where an objectfrequently visits from its trajectories. This process is unaffected by the space-partitioningproblems. We then explain the relationships between the frequent regions and thepartitioned cells using trajectory pattern models based on hidden Markov process. Underthis approach; an object's movements are still described by the partitioned cells; however …,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2007,60
Short text understanding through lexical-semantic analysis,Wen Hua; Zhongyuan Wang; Haixun Wang; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,Understanding short texts is crucial to many applications; but challenges abound. First; shorttexts do not always observe the syntax of a written language. As a result; traditional naturallanguage processing methods cannot be easily applied. Second; short texts usually do notcontain sufficient statistical signals to support many state-of-the-art approaches for textprocessing such as topic modeling. Third; short texts are usually more ambiguous. We arguethat knowledge is needed in order to better understand short texts. In this work; we uselexical-semantic knowledge provided by a well-known semantic network for short textunderstanding. Our knowledge-intensive approach disrupts traditional methods for taskssuch as text segmentation; part-of-speech tagging; and concept labeling; in the sense thatwe focus on semantics in all these tasks.

From trajectories to activities: a spatio-temporal join approach,Kexin Xie; Ke Deng; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract People's activity sequences such as eat at a restaurant after 2 hours of shopping;contains rich semantic information. This information can be explored for a broad range ofapplications and services. However; it is impractical to ask a large number of people torecord their daily activities. As the increasing popularity of GPS-enabled mobile devices; ahuge amount of trajectories which show people's movement behaviors have been acquiring.The natural link between activities and traveling motivates us to investigate a novelapproach to automatically extract sequences of activities from large set of trajectory data.Intuitively; activities can only happen when trajectory is geographically near for a properperiod of time for these activities; such as 30 minutes for dining in a restaurant. In this work;the concepts influence and influence duration are proposed to capture the intuition. We …,Proceedings of the 2009 International Workshop on Location Based Social Networks,2009,58

A key design challenge is achieving interoperability in a large-scaledistributed system with a high degree of heterogeneity in the services. The SMART (SpatialMarketplace) model combines a simple architectural model with only two types of services; amessage-passing paradigm for interaction between customers and service providers; and adeclarative language for expression of requests by a customer.

Dynamic user modeling in social media systems,Hongzhi Yin; Bin Cui; Ling Chen; Zhiting Hu; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Social media provides valuable resources to analyze user behaviors and captureuser preferences. This article focuses on analyzing user behaviors in social media systemsand designing a latent class statistical mixture model; named temporal context-awaremixture model (TCAM); to account for the intentions and preferences behind user behaviors.Based on the observation that the behaviors of a user in social media systems are generallyinfluenced by intrinsic interest as well as the temporal context (eg; the public's attention atthat time); TCAM simultaneously models the topics related to users' intrinsic interests and thetopics related to temporal context and then combines the influences from the two factors tomodel user behaviors in a unified way.

Bounded coordinate system indexing for real-time video clip search,Zi Huang; Heng Tao Shen; Jie Shao; Xiaofang Zhou; Bin Cui,Abstract Recently; video clips have become very popular online. The massive influx of videoclips has created an urgent need for video search engines to facilitate retrieving relevantclips. Different from traditional long videos; a video clip is a short video often expressing amoment of significance. Due to the high complexity of video data; efficient video clip searchfrom large databases turns out to be very challenging. We propose a novel video cliprepresentation model called the Bounded Coordinate System (BCS); which is the first singlerepresentative capturing the dominating content and content—changing trends of a videoclip. It summarizes a video clip by a coordinate system; where each of its coordinate axes isidentified by principal component analysis (PCA) and bounded by the range of dataprojections along the axis.

Effective and efficient query processing for video subsequence identification,Heng Tao Shen; Jie Shao; Zi Huang; Xiaofang Zhou,With the growing demand for visual information of rich content; effective and efficientmanipulations of large video databases are increasingly desired. Many investigations havebeen made on content-based video retrieval. However; despite the importance; videosubsequence identification; which is to find the similar content to a short query clip from along video sequence; has not been well addressed. This paper presents a graphtransformation and matching approach to this problem; with extension to identify theoccurrence of potentially different ordering or length due to content editing. With a novelbatch query algorithm to retrieve similar frames; the mapping relationship between the queryand database video is first represented by a bipartite graph.

As a search result is often assembledfrom multiple relational tables; traditional IR-style ranking and query evaluation methodscannot be applied directly. In this paper; we study the effectiveness and the efficiency issuesof answering top-k keyword query in relational database systems. We propose a newranking formula by adapting existing IR techniques based on a natural notion of virtualdocument. We also propose several efficient query processing methods for the new rankingmethod.

An efficient near-duplicate video shot detection method using shot-based interest points,Xiangmin Zhou; Xiaofang Zhou; Lei Chen; Athman Bouguettaya; Nong Xiao; John A Taylor,We propose a shot-based interest point selection approach for effective and efficient near-duplicate search over a large collection of video shots. The basic idea is to eliminate thelocal descriptors with lower frequencies among the selected video frames from a shot toensure that the shot representation is compact and discriminative. Specifically; we proposean adaptive frame selection strategy called furthest point voronoi (FPV) to produce the shotframe set according to the shot content and frame distribution. We describe a novel strategynamed reference extraction (RE) to extract the shot interest descriptors from a keyframe withthe support of the selected frame set. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of theproposed approaches with extensive experiments.,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,2009,49
Calibrating trajectory data for similarity-based analysis,Han Su; Kai Zheng; Haozhou Wang; Jiamin Huang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Due to the prevalence of GPS-enabled devices and wireless communicationstechnologies; spatial trajectories that describe the movement history of moving objects arebeing generated and accumulated at an unprecedented pace. Trajectory data in a databaseare intrinsically heterogeneous; as they represent discrete approximations of originalcontinuous paths derived using different sampling strategies and different sampling rates.Such heterogeneity can have a negative impact on the effectiveness of trajectory similaritymeasures; which are the basis of many crucial trajectory processing tasks. In this paper; wepioneer a systematic approach to trajectory calibration that is a process to transform aheterogeneous trajectory dataset to one with (almost) unified sampling strategies.Specifically; we propose an anchor-based calibration system that aligns trajectories to a …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD international conference on management of data,2013,48
Progressive keyword search in relational databases,Guoliang Li; Xiaofang Zhou; Jianhua Feng; Jianyong Wang,A common approach to performing keyword search over relational databases is to find theminimum Steiner trees in database graphs. These methods; however; are rather expensiveas the minimum Steiner tree problem is known to be NP-hard. Further; these methodscannot benefit from DBMS capabilities. We propose a new concept called Compact SteinerTree (CSTree); which can be used to approximate the Steiner tree problem for answeringtop-k keyword queries efficiently. We propose a structure-aware index; together with aneffective ranking mechanism for fast; progressive and accurate retrieval of $ top $-$ k $highest ranked CSTrees. The proposed techniques can be implemented using a standardRDBMS to benefit from its indexing and query processing capability. The experimentalresults show that our method achieves high search efficiency and result quality …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,48
Discriminative nonnegative spectral clustering with out-of-sample extension,Yang Yang; Yi Yang; Heng Tao Shen; Yanchun Zhang; Xiaoyong Du; Xiaofang Zhou,Data clustering is one of the fundamental research problems in data mining and machinelearning. Most of the existing clustering methods; for example; normalized cut and (k)-means; have been suffering from the fact that their optimization processes normally lead toan NP-hard problem due to the discretization of the elements in the cluster indicator matrix.A practical way to cope with this problem is to relax this constraint to allow the elements tobe continuous values. The eigenvalue decomposition can be applied to generate acontinuous solution; which has to be further discretized. However; the continuous solution isprobably mixing-signed. This result may cause it deviate severely from the true solution;which should be naturally nonnegative. In this paper; we propose a novel clusteringalgorithm; ie; discriminative nonnegative spectral clustering; to explicitly impose an …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,46
Practical online near-duplicate subsequence detection for continuous video streams,Zi Huang; Heng Tao Shen; Jie Shao; Bin Cui; Xiaofang Zhou,Online video content is surging to an unprecedented level. Massive video publishing andsharing impose heavy demands on online near-duplicate detection for many novel videoapplications. This paper presents an accurate and practical system for online near-duplicatesubsequence detection over continuous video streams. We propose to transform a videostream into a one-dimensional video distance trajectory (VDT) monitoring the continuouschanges of consecutive frames with respect to a reference point; which is further segmentedand represented by a sequence of compact signatures called linear smoothing functions(LSFs). LSFs of each subsequence of the incoming video stream are continuouslygenerated and temporally stored in a buffer for comparison with query LSFs. LSF adoptscompound probability to combine three independent video factors for effective segment …,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,2010,45
Joint modeling of user check-in behaviors for point-of-interest recommendation,Hongzhi Yin; Xiaofang Zhou; Yingxia Shao; Hao Wang; Shazia Sadiq,Abstract Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation has become an important means to helppeople discover attractive and interesting locations; especially when users travel out of town.However; extreme sparsity of user-POI matrix creates a severe challenge. To cope with thischallenge; a growing line of research has exploited the temporal effect; geographical-socialinfluence; content effect and word-of-mouth effect. However; current research lacks anintegrated analysis of the joint effect of the above factors to deal with the issue of data-sparsity; especially in the out-of-town recommendation scenario which has been ignored bymost existing work. In light of the above; we propose a joint probabilistic generative model tomimic user check-in behaviors in a process of decision making; which strategicallyintegrates the above factors to effectively overcome the data sparsity; especially for out-of …,Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2015,44
Instance optimal query processing in spatial networks,Ke Deng; Xiaofang Zhou; Heng Tao Shen; Shazia Sadiq; Xue Li,Abstract The performance optimization of query processing in spatial networks focuses onminimizing network data accesses and the cost of network distance calculations. This paperproposes algorithms for network k-NN queries; range queries; closest-pair queries and multi-source skyline queries based on a novel processing framework; namely; incremental lowerbound constraint. By giving high processing priority to the query associated data points andutilizing the incremental nature of the lower bound; the performance of our algorithms isbetter optimized in contrast to the corresponding algorithms based on known frameworkincremental Euclidean restriction and incremental network expansion.

An adaptive and dynamic dimensionality reduction method for high-dimensional indexing,Heng Tao Shen; Xiaofang Zhou; Aoying Zhou,Abstract The notorious “dimensionality curse” is a well-known phenomenon for any multi-dimensional indexes attempting to scale up to high dimensions. One well-known approachto overcome degradation in performance with respect to increasing dimensions is to reducethe dimensionality of the original dataset before constructing the index. However; identifyingthe correlation among the dimensions and effectively reducing them are challenging tasks.In this paper; we present an adaptive Multi-level Mahalanobis-based DimensionalityReduction (MMDR) technique for high-dimensional indexing. Our MMDR technique has fournotable features compared to existing methods. First; it discovers elliptical clusters for moreeffective dimensionality reduction by using only the low-dimensional subspaces. Second;data points in the different axis systems are indexed using a single B+-tree. Third; our …,The VLDB Journal,2007,41
Data partitioning for parallel spatial join processing,Xiaofang Zhou; David J Abel; David Truffet,Abstract The cost of spatial join processing can be very high because of the large sizes ofspatial objects and the computation-intensive spatial operations. While parallel processingseems a natural solution to this problem; it is not clear how spatial data can be partitioned forthis purpose. Various spatial data partitioning methods are examined in this paper. Aframework combining the data-partitioning techniques used by most parallel join algorithmsin relational databases and the filter-and-refine strategy for spatial operation processing isproposed for parallel spatial join processing. Object duplication caused by multi-assignmentin spatial data partitioning can result in extra CPU cost as well as extra communication cost.We find that the key to overcome this problem is to preserve spatial locality in taskdecomposition. We show in this paper that a near-optimal speedup can be achieved for …,International Symposium on Spatial Databases,1997,41
Personalized trajectory matching in spatial networks,Shuo Shang; Ruogu Ding; Kai Zheng; Christian S Jensen; Panos Kalnis; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract With the increasing availability of moving-object tracking data; trajectory search andmatching is increasingly important. We propose and investigate a novel problem calledpersonalized trajectory matching (PTM). In contrast to conventional trajectory similaritysearch by spatial distance only; PTM takes into account the significance of each samplepoint in a query trajectory. A PTM query takes a trajectory with user-specified weights foreach sample point in the trajectory as its argument. It returns the trajectory in an argumentdata set with the highest similarity to the query trajectory. We believe that this type of querymay bring significant benefits to users in many popular applications such as route planning;carpooling; friend recommendation; traffic analysis; urban computing; and location-basedservices in general. PTM query processing faces two challenges: how to prune the search …,The VLDB Journal,2014,40
Mining multi-tag association for image tagging,Yang Yang; Zi Huang; Heng Tao Shen; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Automatic media tagging plays a critical role in modern tag-based media retrievalsystems. Existing tagging schemes mostly perform tag assignment based on communitycontributed media resources; where the tags are provided by users interactively. However;such social resources usually contain dirty and incomplete tags; which severely limit theperformance of these tagging methods. In this paper; we propose a novel automatic imagetagging method aiming to automatically discover more complete tags associated withinformation importance for test images. Given an image dataset; all the near-duplicateclusters are discovered. For each near-duplicate cluster; all the tags occurring in the clusterform the cluster's “document”. Given a test image; we firstly initialize the candidate tag setfrom its near-duplicate cluster's document. The candidate tag set is then expanded by …,World Wide Web,2011,40
Instant advertising in mobile peer-to-peer networks,Zaiben Chen; Heng Tao Shen; Quanqing Xu; Xiaofang Zhou,To explore the benefit of advertising instant and location-aware commercials that can not beeffectively promoted by traditional medium like TV program and Internet; we propose in thispaper a solution for disseminating instant advertisements to users within the area of interestthrough a Mobile Peer-to-Peer Network. This is a new application scenario; and we devisean opportunistic gossiping model for advertisement propagation with spatial and temporalconstraints. As bandwidth and computational resources are limited in a wirelessenvironment; two optimization mechanisms utilizing distance and velocity information areprovided for reducing redundant advertising messages. User interest is also considered asanother critica factor in adjusting the advertisement propagation model; and we adopt theFM algorithm to achieve efficient counting of distinct users' interests.

Approximating query answering on RDF databases,Hai Huang; Chengfei Liu; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Database users may be frustrated by no answers returned when they pose a queryon the database. In this paper; we study the problem of relaxing queries on RDF databasesin order to acquire approximate answers. We address two problems in efficient queryrelaxation. First; to ensure the quality of answers; we compute the similarities betweenrelaxed queries with regard to the user query and use them to score the potential relevantanswers. Second; for obtaining top-k answers; we develop two algorithms. One is based onthe best-first strategy and relaxed queries are executed in the ranking order. The batchbased algorithm executes the relaxed queries as a batch and avoids unnecessary executioncost. At last; we implement and experimentally evaluate our approaches.,World Wide Web,2012,38
K-nearest neighbor search for fuzzy objects,Kai Zheng; Pui Cheong Fung; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract The K-Nearest Neighbor search (kNN) problem has been investigated extensivelyin the past due to its broad range of applications. In this paper we study this problem in thecontext of fuzzy objects that have indeterministic boundaries. Fuzzy objects play animportant role in many areas; such as biomedical image databases and GIS. Existingresearch on fuzzy objects mainly focuses on modelling basic fuzzy object types andoperations; leaving the processing of more advanced queries such as kNN queryuntouched. In this paper; we propose two new kinds of kNN queries for fuzzy objects; Ad-hockNN query (AKNN) and Range kNN query (RKNN); to find the k nearest objects qualifying ata probability threshold or within a probability range. For efficient AKNN query processing; weoptimize the basic best-first search algorithm by deriving more accurate approximations …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,38

Crowdplanner: A crowd-based route recommendation system,Han Su; Kai Zheng; Jiamin Huang; Hoyoung Jeung; Lei Chen; Xiaofang Zhou,As travel is taking more significant part in our life; route recommendation service becomes abig business and attracts many major players in IT industry. Given a pair of user-specifiedorigin and destination; a route recommendation service aims to provide users with the routesof best travelling experience according to criteria; such as travelling distance; travelling time;traffic condition; etc. However; previous research shows that even the routes recommendedby the big-thumb service providers can deviate significantly from the routes travelled byexperienced drivers. It means travellers' preferences on route selection are influenced bymany latent and dynamic factors that are hard to model exactly with pre-defined formulas. Inthis work we approach this challenging problem with a very different perspective-leveragingcrowds' knowledge to improve the recommendation quality.

Thesemethods; however; are rather expensive as the minimum Steiner tree problem is known tobe NP-hard.

However;extreme sparsity of user-POI matrix creates a severe challenge. To cope with this challenge;we propose a unified probabilistic generative model; Topic-Region Model (TRM); tosimultaneously discover the semantic; temporal and spatial patterns of users' check-inactivities; and to model their joint effect on users' decision-making for POIs. We conductextensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our TRM on two real large-scaledatasets; and the experimental results clearly demonstrate that TRM outperforms the state-of-art methods.,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM international conference on Multimedia,2015,34
Extracting texture features from arbitrary-shaped regions for image retrieval,Ying Liu; Xiaofang Zhou; Wei-Ying Ma,Lots of work has been done in texture feature extraction for rectangular images; but not asmuch attention has been paid to the arbitrary-shaped regions available in region-basedimage retrieval (RBIR) systems. In This work; we present a texture feature extractionalgorithm; based on projection onto convex sets (POCS) theory. POCS iterativelyconcentrates more and more energy into the selected coefficients from which texturefeatures of an arbitrary-shaped region can be extracted.

Best keyword cover search,Ke Deng; Xin Li; Jiaheng Lu; Xiaofang Zhou,It is common that the objects in a spatial database (eg; restaurants/hotels) are associatedwith keyword (s) to indicate their businesses/services/features. An interesting problemknown as Closest Keywords search is to query objects; called keyword cover; whichtogether cover a set of query keywords and have the minimum inter-objects distance. Inrecent years; we observe the increasing availability and importance of keyword rating inobject evaluation for the better decision making. This motivates us to investigate a genericversion of Closest Keywords search called Best Keyword Cover which considers inter-objects distance as well as the keyword rating of objects. The baseline algorithm is inspiredby the methods of Closest Keywords search which is based on exhaustively combiningobjects from different query keywords to generate candidate keyword covers.

Interactive top-k spatial keyword queries,Kai Zheng; Han Su; Bolong Zheng; Shuo Shang; Jiajie Xu; Jiajun Liu; Xiaofang Zhou,Conventional top-k spatial keyword queries require users to explicitly specify theirpreferences between spatial proximity and keyword relevance. In this work we investigatehow to eliminate this requirement by enhancing the conventional queries with interaction;resulting in Interactive Top-k Spatial Keyword (ITkSK) query. Having confirmed the feasibilityby theoretical analysis; we propose a three-phase solution focusing on both effectivenessand efficiency. The first phase substantially narrows down the search space for subsequentphases by efficiently retrieving a set of geo-textual k-skyband objects as the initialcandidates. In the second phase three practical strategies for selecting a subset ofcandidates are developed with the aim of maximizing the expected benefit for learning userpreferences at each round of interaction.

Efficient secure similarity computation on encrypted trajectory data,An Liu; Kai Zhengy; Lu Liz; Guanfeng Liu; Lei Zhao; Xiaofang Zhou,Outsourcing database to clouds is a scalable and cost-effective way for large scale datastorage; management; and query processing. Trajectory data contain rich spatio-temporalrelationships and reveal many forms of individual sensitive information (eg; home address;health condition); which necessitate them to be encrypted before being outsourced forprivacy concerns. However; efficient query processing over encrypted trajectory data is avery challenging task. Though some achievements have been reported very recently forsimple queries (eg; SQL queries; kNN queries) on encrypted data; there is rather limitedprogress on secure evaluation of trajectory queries because they are more complex andneed special treatment. In this paper; we focus on secure trajectory similarity computationthat is the cornerstone of secure trajectory query processing.

In this paper; we study the problem of relaxing queries on RDF databasesin order to acquire approximate answers. We address two problems for efficient queryrelaxation. First; to ensure the quality of answers; we compute the similarities of relaxedqueries with regard to the original query and use them to score the potential relevantanswers. We also propose the algorithm to get most relevant answers as soon as possible.Second; to optimise query relaxation process; we characterize a type of unnecessaryrelaxed queries which do not contribute to the final results and propose the method to prunethem from the query relaxation graph.

Image attribute adaptation,Yahong Han; Yi Yang; Zhigang Ma; Haoquan Shen; Nicu Sebe; Xiaofang Zhou,Visual attributes can be considered as a middle-level semantic cue that bridges the gapbetween low-level image features and high-level object classes. Thus; attributes have theadvantage of transcending specific semantic categories or describing objects acrosscategories. Since attributes are often human-nameable and domain specific; much workconstructs attribute annotations ad hoc or take them from an application-dependentontology. To facilitate other applications with attributes; it is necessary to develop methodswhich can adapt a well-defined set of attributes to novel images. In this paper; we propose aframework for image attribute adaptation. The goal is to automatically adapt the knowledgeof attributes from a well-defined auxiliary image set to a target image set; thus assisting inpredicting appropriate attributes for target images.

Approximate keyword search in semantic trajectory database,Bolong Zheng; Nicholas Jing Yuan; Kai Zheng; Xing Xie; Shazia Sadiq; Xiaofang Zhou,Driven by the advances in location positioning techniques and the popularity of locationsharing services; semantic enriched trajectory data have become unprecedentedlyavailable. While finding relevant Point-of-Interest (POIs) based on users' locations and querykeywords has been extensively studied in the past years; it is largely untouched to explorethe keyword queries in the context of semantic trajectory database. In this paper; we studythe problem of approximate keyword search in massive semantic trajectories. Given a set ofquery keywords; an approximate keyword query of semantic trajectory (AKQST) returns ktrajectories that contain the most relevant keywords to the query and yield the least traveleffort in the meantime. The main difference between AKQST and conventional spatialkeyword queries is that there is no query location in AKQST; which means the search …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,29
Sharkdb: An in-memory column-oriented trajectory storage,Haozhou Wang; Kai Zheng; Jiajie Xu; Bolong Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou; Shazia Sadiq,Abstract The last decade has witnessed the prevalence of sensor and GPS technologies thatproduce a high volume of trajectory data representing the motion history of moving objects.However some characteristics of trajectories such as variable lengths and asynchronoussampling rates make it difficult to fit into traditional database systems that are disk-based andtuple-oriented. Motivated by the success of column store and recent development of in-memory databases; we try to explore the potential opportunities of boosting the performanceof trajectory data processing by designing a novel trajectory storage within main memory. Incontrast to most existing trajectory indexing methods that keep consecutive samples of thesame trajectory in the same disk page; we partition the database into frames in which thepositions of all moving objects at the same time instant are stored together and aligned in …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM international conference on conference on information and knowledge management,2014,29

Statistical summarization of content features for fast near-duplicate video detection,Heng Tao Shen; Xiaofang Zhou; Zi Huang; Jie Shao,Abstract This paper outlines a system for detecting near-duplicate videos based on a novelsummarization of content features for each clip. It captures the dominating content andcontent changing trends of a video; so this representation is very compact and effective.Unlike traditional frame-to-frame comparisons that involve quadratic computationalcomplexity; the similarity measure of our method is only linear in dimensionality of featurespace and independent of video length. To further improve the search efficiency for verylarge video databases; an effective indexing structure is deployed to significantly reduce thenumber of videos for comparison.

A multi-resolution surface distance model for k-NN query processing,Ke Deng; Xiaofang Zhou; Heng Tao Shen; Qing Liu; Kai Xu; Xuemin Lin,Abstract A spatial k-NN query returns k nearest points in a point dataset to a given querypoint. To measure the distance between two points; most of the literature focuses on theEuclidean distance or the network distance. For many applications; such as wildlifemovement; it is necessary to consider the surface distance; which is computed from theshortest path along a terrain surface. In this paper; we investigate the problem of efficientsurface k-NN (sk-NN) query processing. This is an important yet highly challenging problembecause the underlying environment data can be very large and the computational cost offinding the shortest path on a surface can be very high. To minimize the amount of surfacedata to be used and the cost of surface distance computation; a multi-resolution surfacedistance model is proposed in this paper to take advantage of monotonic distance …,The VLDB Journal,2008,27

However; a raw trajectory in theform of sequence of timestamped locations does not make much sense for humans withoutsemantic representation.

Joint minimization of a classifier's loss function and an l2; 1-norm regularization has been shown to be effective for feature selection. However; theappropriate feature subset learned from different classifiers' loss function may be different.Less effort has been made on improving the performance of feature selection by theensemble of different classifiers' criteria and take advantages of them. Furthermore; for thecases when only a few labeled data per class are available; overfitting would be a potentialproblem and the performance of each classifier is restrained.

Although humanmovement exhibits sequential patterns in LBSNs; most current studies on spatial itemrecommendations do not consider the sequential influence of locations. Leveragingsequential patterns in spatial item recommendation is; however; very challenging;considering 1) users' check-in data in LBSNs has a low sampling rate in both space andtime; which renders existing prediction techniques on GPS trajectories ineffective; 2) theprediction space is extremely large; with millions of distinct locations as the next predictiontarget; which impedes the application of classical Markov chain models; and 3) there is no …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,25
Identifying users' topical tasks in web search,Wen Hua; Yangqiu Song; Haixun Wang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract A search task represents an atomic information need of a user in web search. Tasksconsist of queries and their reformulations; and identifying tasks is important for searchengines since they provide valuable information for determining user satisfaction withsearch results; predicting user search intent; and suggesting queries to the user. Traditionalapproaches to identifying tasks exploit either temporal or lexical features of queries.However; many query refinements are topical; which means that a query and its refinementsmay not be similar on the lexical level. Furthermore; multiple tasks in the same searchsession may interleave; which means we cannot simply order the searches by theirtimestamps and divide the session into multiple tasks. Thus; in order to identify taskscorrectly; we need to be able to compare two queries at the semantic level.

On group nearest group query processing,Ke Deng; Shazia Sadiq; Xiaofang Zhou; Hu Xu; Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung; Yansheng Lu,Given a data point set D; a query point set Q; and an integer k; the Group Nearest Group(GNG) query finds a subset ω (| ω|≤ k) of points from Dsuch that the total distance from allpoints in Q to the nearest point in ω is not greater than any other subset ω'(| ω'|≤ k) of pointsin D. GNG query is a partition-based clustering problem which can be found in many realapplications and is NP-hard. In this paper; Exhaustive Hierarchical Combination (EHC)algorithm and Subset Hierarchial Refinement (SHR) algorithm are developed for GNG queryprocessing. While EHC is capable to provide the optimal solution for k= 2; SHR is an efficientapproximate approach that combines database techniques with local search heuristic.

Clustering web transactions; thus; may capture suchinformative knowledge; in turn; build user profiles; which are associated with differentnavigational patterns. For some advanced web applications; such as web recommendationor personalization; the aforementioned work is crucial to make web users get their preferredinformation accurately. On the other hand; the conventional web usage mining techniquesfor clustering web objects often perform clustering on usage data directly rather than take theunderlying semantic relationships among the web objects into account. Latent SemanticAnalysis (LSA) model is a commonly used approach for capturing semantic associationsamong co-occurrence observations.. In this paper; we propose a LSA-based approach for …,International Conference on Advanced Data Mining and Applications,2005,25
Modeling user mobility for location promotion in location-based social networks,Wen-Yuan Zhu; Wen-Chih Peng; Ling-Jyh Chen; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract With the explosion of smartphones and social network services; location-basedsocial networks (LBSNs) are increasingly seen as tools for businesses (eg; restaurants;hotels) to promote their products and services. In this paper; we investigate the keytechniques that can help businesses promote their locations by advertising wisely throughthe underlying LBSNs. In order to maximize the benefit of location promotion; we formalize itas an influence maximization problem in an LBSN; ie; given a target location and an LBSN;which a set of k users (called seeds) should be advertised initially such that they cansuccessfully propagate and attract most other users to visit the target location. Existingstudies have proposed different ways to calculate the information propagation probability;that is how likely a user may influence another; in the settings of static social network …,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,24
Possible and certain SQL keys,Henning Köhler; Sebastian Link; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Driven by the dominance of the relational model; the requirements of modernapplications; and the veracity of data; we revisit the fundamental notion of a key in relationaldatabases with NULLs. In SQL database systems primary key columns are NOT NULL bydefault. NULL columns may occur in unique constraints which only guarantee uniquenessfor tuples which do not feature null markers in any of the columns involved; and thereforeserve a different function than primary keys. We investigate the notions of possible andcertain keys; which are keys that hold in some or all possible worlds that can originate froman SQL table; respectively. Possible keys coincide with the unique constraint of SQL; andthus provide a semantics for their syntactic definition in the SQL standard. Certain keysextend primary keys to include NULL columns; and thus form a sufficient and necessary …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,24
Batch nearest neighbor search for video retrieval,Jie Shao; Zi Huang; Heng Tao Shen; Xiaofang Zhou; Ee-Peng Lim; Yijun Li,To retrieve similar videos to a query clip from a large database; each video is oftenrepresented by a sequence of high-dimensional feature vectors. Typically; given a queryvideo containing m feature vectors; an independent nearest neighbor (NN) search for eachfeature vector is often first performed. After completing all the NN searches; an overallsimilarity is then computed; ie; a single content-based video retrieval usually involves mindividual NN searches. Since normally nearby feature vectors in a video are similar; a largenumber of expensive random disk accesses are expected to repeatedly occur; whichcrucially affects the overall query performance. Batch nearest neighbor (BNN) search isstated as a batch operation that performs a number of individual NN searches. This paperpresents a novel approach towards efficient high-dimensional BNN search called …,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,2008,24
Location update strategies for network-constrained moving objects,Zhiming Ding; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Location update strategy is one of the most important factors that affect theperformance of moving objects databases. In this paper; a new location update mechanism;Location Update Mechanism for Network-Constrained Moving Objects (Net-LUM); isproposed. Through active-motion-vector-based network-matching and special treatment withjunctions; Net-LUM can achieve better performances in terms of communication costs andlocation tracking accuracy; which is confirmed by the experimental results.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2008,24
Adapting to user interest drift for poi recommendation,Hongzhi Yin; Xiaofang Zhou; Bin Cui; Hao Wang; Kai Zheng; Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen,Point-of-Interest recommendation is an essential means to help people discover attractivelocations; especially when people travel out of town or to unfamiliar regions. While agrowing line of research has focused on modeling user geographical preferences for POIrecommendation; they ignore the phenomenon of user interest drift across geographicalregions; ie; users tend to have different interests when they travel in different regions; whichdiscounts the recommendation quality of existing methods; especially for out-of-town users.In this paper; we propose a latent class probabilistic generative model Spatial-TemporalLDA (ST-LDA) to learn region-dependent personal interests according to the contents oftheir checked-in POIs at each region. As the users' check-in records left in the out-of-townregions are extremely sparse; ST-LDA incorporates the crowd's preferences by …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,23
Calibrating trajectory data for spatio-temporal similarity analysis,Han Su; Kai Zheng; Jiamin Huang; Haozhou Wang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Due to the prevalence of GPS-enabled devices and wireless communicationstechnologies; spatial trajectories that describe the movement history of moving objects arebeing generated and accumulated at an unprecedented pace. Trajectory data in a databaseare intrinsically heterogeneous; as they represent discrete approximations of originalcontinuous paths derived using different sampling strategies and different sampling rates.Such heterogeneity can have a negative impact on the effectiveness of trajectory similaritymeasures; which are the basis of many crucial trajectory processing tasks. In this paper; wepioneer a systematic approach to trajectory calibration that is a process to transform aheterogeneous trajectory dataset to one with (almost) unified sampling strategies.Specifically; we propose an anchor-based calibration system that aligns trajectories to a …,The VLDB Journal,2015,23
Finding the most accessible locations: reverse path nearest neighbor query in road networks,Shuo Shang; Bo Yuan; Ke Deng; Kexin Xie; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract In this paper; we propose and investigate a novel spatial query called Reverse PathNearest Neighbor (R-PNN) search to find the most accessible locations in road networks.Given a trajectory data-set and a list of location candidates specified by users; if a location ois the Path Nearest Neighbor (PNN) of k trajectories; the influence-factor of o is defined as kand the R-PNN query returns the location with the highest influence-factor. The R-PNNquery is an extension of the conventional Reverse Nearest Neighbor (RNN) search. It canbe found in many important applications such as urban planning; facility allocation; trafficmonitoring; etc. To answer the R-PNN query efficiently; an effective trajectory data pre-processing technique is conducted in the first place. We cluster the trajectories into severalgroups according to their distribution. Based on the grouped trajectory data; a two-phase …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2011,23
Mining near-duplicate graph for cluster-based reranking of web video search results,Zi Huang; Bo Hu; Hong Cheng; Heng Tao Shen; Hongyan Liu; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Recently; video search reranking has been an effective mechanism to improve theinitial text-based ranking list by incorporating visual consistency among the result videos.While existing methods attempt to rerank all the individual result videos; they suffer fromseveral drawbacks. In this article; we propose a new video reranking paradigm called cluster-based video reranking (CVR). The idea is to first construct a video near-duplicate graphrepresenting the visual similarity relationship among videos; followed by identifying the near-duplicate clusters from the video near-duplicate graph; then ranking the obtained near-duplicate clusters based on cluster properties and intercluster links; and finally for eachranked cluster; a representative video is selected and returned. Compared to existingmethods; the new CVR ranks clusters and exhibits several advantages; including …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2010,23
Multiresolution amalgamation: dynamic spatial data cube generation,Sham Prasher; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Aggregating spatial objects is a necessary step in generating spatial data cubes tosupport roll-up/drill-down operations. Current approaches face performance bottleneckissues when attempting to dynamically aggregate geometries for a large set of spatial data.We observe that changing the resolution of a region is reflective of the fact that the precisionof spatial data can be changed to certain extent without compromising its usefulness.Moreover most spatial datasets are stored at much higher resolutions than are necessary forsome applications. The existing approaches; which aggregate objects at a base resolution;often results in a processing bottleneck due to extraneous I/O. In this paper; we develop anew aggregation methodology that can significantly reduce retrieval (I/O) costs and improveoverall performance by utilising multiresolution data storage and retrieval techniques …,Proceedings of the 15th Australasian database conference-Volume 27,2004,23
Effective data co-reduction for multimedia similarity search,Zi Huang; Hengtao Shen; Jiajun Liu; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Multimedia similarity search has been playing a critical role in many novelapplications. Typically; multimedia objects are described by high-dimensional featurevectors (or points) which are organized in databases for retrieval. Although many high-dimensional indexing methods have been proposed to facilitate the search process; efficientretrieval over large; sparse and extremely high-dimensional databases remains challengingdue to the continuous increases in data size and feature dimensionality. In this paper; wepropose the first framework for Data Co-Reduction (DCR) on both data size and featuredimensionality. By utilizing recently developed co-clustering methods; DCR simultaneouslyreduces both size and dimensionality of the original data into a compact subspace; wherelower bounds of the actual distances in the original space can be efficiently established to …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,22
Adaptive subspace symbolization for content-based video detection,Xiangmin Zhou; Xiaofang Zhou; Lei Chen; Yanfeng Shu; Athman Bouguettaya; John A Taylor,Efficiently and effectively identifying similar videos is an important and nontrivial problem incontent-based video retrieval. This paper proposes a subspace symbolization approach;namely SUDS; for content-based retrieval on very large video databases. The novelty ofSUDS is that it explores the data distribution in subspaces to build a visual dictionary withwhich the videos are processed by deriving the string matching techniques with two-stepdata simplification. Specifically; we first propose an adaptive approach; called VLP; to extracta series of dominant subspaces of variable lengths from the whole visual feature spacewithout the constraint of dimension consecutiveness. A stable visual dictionary is built byclustering the video keyframes over each dominant subspace. A compact videorepresentation model is developed by transforming each keyframe into a word that is a …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2010,22
Sampling dirty data for matching attributes,Henning Köhler; Xiaofang Zhou; Shazia Sadiq; Yanfeng Shu; Kerry Taylor,Abstract We investigate the problem of creating and analyzing samples of relationaldatabases to find relationships between string-valued attributes. Our focus is on identifyingattribute pairs whose value sets overlap; a pre-condition for typical joins over such attributes.However; real-world data sets are often'dirty'; especially when integrating data from differentsources. To deal with this issue; we propose new similarity measures between sets ofstrings; which not only consider set based similarity; but also similarity between stringsinstances. To make the measures effective; we develop efficient algorithms for distributedsample creation and similarity computation. Test results show that for dirty data ourmeasures are more accurate for measuring value overlap than existing sample-basedmethods; but we also observe that there is a clear tradeoff between accuracy and speed …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,22
A confidence based recognition system for TV commercial extraction,Yijun Li; Danqing Zhang; Xiangmin Zhou; Jesse S Jin,Abstract Automatic real-time recognition of TV commercials is an essential step for TVbroadcast monitoring. It comprises two basic tasks: rapid detection of known commercialsthat are stored in a database; and accurate recognition of unknown ones that appear for thefirst time in TV streaming. The existing approaches; however; can not perform robustcommercial detection because they highly rely on the assumption that black frames areinserted before commercial breaks. In this paper; we propose a novel confidence-basedrecognition system to address this challenging issues. Those known commercials aredetected by applying a fast search algorithm to a pre-built commercial database; and thoseunknown ones are determined by managing a buffer containing possible yet unconfirmedcommercial spots. A new concept of confidence level is defined for each candidate …,Proceedings of the nineteenth conference on Australasian database-Volume 75,2008,22
A web recommendation technique based on probabilistic latent semantic analysis,Guandong Xu; Yanchun Zhang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Web transaction data between Web visitors and Web functionalities usually conveyuser task-oriented behavior pattern. Mining such type of clickstream data will lead to captureusage pattern information. Nowadays Web usage mining technique has become one ofmost widely used methods for Web recommendation; which customizes Web content to user-preferred style. Traditional techniques of Web usage mining; such as Web user session orWeb page clustering; association rule and frequent navigational path mining can onlydiscover usage pattern explicitly. They; however; cannot reveal the underlying navigationalactivities and identify the latent relationships that are associated with the patterns amongWeb users as well as Web pages. In this work; we propose a Web recommendationframework incorporating Web usage mining technique based on Probabilistic Latent …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2005,22
Finding event-oriented patterns in long temporal sequences,Xingzhi Sun; Maria E Orlowska; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract A major task of traditional temporal event sequence mining is to find all frequentevent patterns from a long temporal sequence. In many real applications; however; eventsare often grouped into different types; and not all types are of equal importance. In thispaper; we consider the problem of efficient mining of temporal event sequences which leadto an instance of a specific type of event. Temporal constraints are used to ensure sensibilityof the mining results. We will first generalise and formalise the problem of event-orientedtemporal sequence data mining. After discussing some unique issues in this new problem;we give a set of criteria; which are adapted from traditional data mining techniques; tomeasure the quality of patterns to be discovered. Finally we present an algorithm to discoverpotentially interesting patterns.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2003,22
Data quality aware queries in collaborative information systems,Naiem Khodabandehloo Yeganeh; Shazia Sadiq; Ken Deng; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract The issue of data quality is gaining importance as individuals as well ascorporations are increasingly relying on multiple; often external sources of data to makedecisions. Traditional query systems do not factor in data quality considerations in theirresponse. Studies into the diverse interpretations of data quality indicate that fitness for useis a fundamental criteria in the evaluation of data quality. In this paper; we present a 4 stepmethodology that includes user preferences for data quality in the response of queries frommultiple sources. User preferences are modelled using the notion of preference hierarchies.We have developed an SQL extension to facilitate the specification of preferencehierarchies. Further; we will demonstrate through experimentation how our approachproduces an improved result in query response.,*,2009,21
Multiresolution spatial databases: Making web-based spatial applications faster,Xiaofang Zhou; Sham Prasher; Sai Sun; Kai Xu,Abstract Spatial data has now been used extensively in the Web environment; providingonline customized maps and supporting map-based applications. The full potential of Web-based spatial applications; however; has yet to be achieved due to performance issuesrelated to the large sizes and high complexity of spatial data. In this paper; we introduce amultiresolution approach to spatial data management and query processing such that thedatabase server can choose spatial data at the right resolution level for different Webapplications. One highly desirable property of the proposed approach is that the server-sideprocessing cost and network traffic can be reduced when the level of resolution required byapplications are low. Another advantage is that our approach pushes complexmultiresolution structures and algorithms into the spatial database engine. That is; the …,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2004,21
Spatial query processing for fuzzy objects,Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou; Pui Cheong Fung; Kexin Xie,Abstract Range and nearest neighbor queries are the most common types of spatial queries;which have been investigated extensively in the last decades due to its broad range ofapplications. In this paper; we study this problem in the context of fuzzy objects that haveindeterministic boundaries. Fuzzy objects play an important role in many areas; such asbiomedical image databases and GIS communities. Existing research on fuzzy objectsmainly focuses on modeling basic fuzzy object types and operations; leaving the processingof more advanced queries largely untouched. In this paper; we propose two new kinds ofspatial queries for fuzzy objects; namely single threshold query and continuous thresholdquery; to determine the query results which qualify at a certain probability threshold andwithin a probability interval; respectively. For efficient single threshold query processing …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2012,20
PNN query processing on compressed trajectories,Shuo Shang; Bo Yuan; Ke Deng; Kexin Xie; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Trajectory compression is widely used in spatial-temporal databases as it cannotably reduce (i) the computation/communication load of clients (GPS-enabled mobiledevices) and (ii) the storage cost of servers. Compared with original trajectories;compressed trajectories have clear advantages in data processing; transmitting; storing; etc.In this paper; we investigate a novel problem of searching the Path Nearest Neighbor basedon Compressed Trajectories (PNN-CT query). This type of query is conducted oncompressed trajectories and the target is to retrieve the PNN with the highest probability(lossy compression leads to the uncertainty); which can bring significant benefits to users inmany popular applications such as trip planning. To answer the PNN-CT query effectivelyand efficiently; a two-phase solution is proposed. First; we use the meta-data and sample …,GeoInformatica,2012,20
Discovering user access pattern based on probabilistic latent factor model,Guandong Xu; Yanchun Zhang; Jiangang Ma; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract There has been an increased demand for characterizing user access patterns usingweb mining techniques since the informative knowledge extracted from web server log filescan not only offer benefits for web site structure improvement but also for betterunderstanding of user navigational behavior. In this paper; we present a web usage miningmethod; which utilize web user usage and page linkage information to capture user accesspattern based on Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) model. A specificprobabilistic model analysis algorithm; EM algorithm; is applied to the integrated usage datato infer the latent semantic factors as well as generate user session clusters for revealinguser access patterns.

Multiscale histograms: Summarizing topological relations in large spatial datasets,Xuemin Lin; Qing Liu; Yidong Yuan; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Summarizing topological relations is fundamental to many spatial applicationsincluding spatial query optimization. In this paper; we present several novel techniques toeffectively construct cell density based spatial histograms for range (window)summarizations restricted to the four most important topological relations: contains;contained; overlap; and disjoint. We first present a novel framework to construct a multiscalehistogram composed of multiple Euler histograms with the guarantee of the exactsummarization results for aligned windows in constant time. Then we present anapproximate algorithm; with the approximate ratio 19/12; to minimize the storage spaces ofsuch multiscale Euler histograms; although the problem is generally NP-hard. To conform toa limited storage space where only k Euler histograms are allowed; an effective algorithm …,Proceedings of the 29th international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 29,2003,20
A Convex Formulation for Spectral Shrunk Clustering.,Xiaojun Chang; Feiping Nie; Zhigang Ma; Yi Yang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Spectral clustering is a fundamental technique in the field of data mining andinformation processing. Most existing spectral clustering algorithms integrate dimensionalityreduction into the clustering process assisted by manifold learning in the original space.However; the manifold in reduced-dimensional subspace is likely to exhibit alteredproperties in contrast with the original space. Thus; applying manifold information obtainedfrom the original space to the clustering process in a low-dimensional subspace is prone toinferior performance. Aiming to address this issue; we propose a novel convex algorithm thatmines the manifold structure in the low-dimensional subspace. In addition; our unifiedlearning process makes the manifold learning particularly tailored for the clustering.Compared with other related methods; the proposed algorithm results in more structured …,AAAI,2015,19
Matching commercial clips from TV streams using a unique; robust and compact signature,Yijun Li; Jesse S Jin; Xiaofang Zhou,One of critical challenges in automatic recognition of TV commercials is to generate aunique; robust and compact signature. Uniqueness indicates the ability to identify thesimilarity among the commercial video clips which may have slight content variation.Robustness means the ability to match commercial video clips containing the same contentbut probably with different digitalization/encoding; some noise data; and/or transmission andrecording distortion. Efficiency is about the capability of effectively matching commercialvideo sequences with a low computation cost and storage overhead. In this paper; wepresent a binary signature based method; which meets all the three criteria above; bycombining the techniques of ordinal and color measurements. Experimental results on a reallarge commercial video database show that our novel approach delivers a significantly …,Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications; 2005. DICTA'05.

Confirmation: increasing resource availability for transactional workflows,Chengfei Liu; Xuemin Lin; Maria Orlowska; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract The notion of compensation is widely used in advanced transaction models asmeans of recovery from a failure. Similar concepts are adopted for providing “transaction-like” behaviour for long business processes supported by workflows technology. In general;it is not trivial to design compensating tasks for tasks in the context of a workflow. Actually; atask in a workflow process does not have to be compensatable in the sense that theforcibility of “reverse” operations of the task is not always guaranteed by the applicationsemantics. In addition; the isolation requirement on data resources may make a task difficultto compensate. In this paper; we first look into the requirements that a compensating taskhas to satisfy. Then we introduce a new concept called confirmation. With the help ofconfirmation; we are able to modify most non-compensatable tasks so that they become …,Information Sciences,2003,19
Discovering interpretable geo-social communities for user behavior prediction,Hongzhi Yin; Zhiting Hu; Xiaofang Zhou; Hao Wang; Kai Zheng; Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen; Shazia Sadiq,Social community detection is a growing field of interest in the area of social networkapplications; and many approaches have been developed; including graph partitioning;latent space model; block model and spectral clustering. Most existing work purely focuseson network structure information which is; however; often sparse; noisy and lack ofinterpretability. To improve the accuracy and interpretability of community discovery; wepropose to infer users' social communities by incorporating their spatiotemporal data andsemantic information. Technically; we propose a unified probabilistic generative model; User-Community-Geo-Topic (UCGT); to simulate the generative process of communities as aresult of network proximities; spatiotemporal co-occurrences and semantic similarity.

Webput: Efficient web-based data imputation,Zhixu Li; Mohamed A Sharaf; Laurianne Sitbon; Shazia Sadiq; Marta Indulska; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract In this paper; we present WebPut; a prototype system that adopts a novel web-based approach to the data imputation problem. Towards this; Webput utilizes the availableinformation in an incomplete database in conjunction with the data consistency principle.Moreover; WebPut extends effective Information Extraction (IE) methods for the purpose offormulating web search queries that are capable of effectively retrieving missing values withhigh accuracy. WebPut employs a confidence-based scheme that efficiently leverages oursuite of data imputation queries to automatically select the most effective imputation queryfor each missing value. A greedy iterative algorithm is also proposed to schedule theimputation order of the different missing values in a database; and in turn the issuing of theircorresponding imputation queries; for improving the accuracy and efficiency of WebPut …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2012,18
Using local popularity of web resources for geo-ranking of search engine results,Saeid Asadi; Xiaofang Zhou; Guowei Yang,Abstract Search engines retrieve and rank Web pages which are not only relevant to a querybut also important or popular for the users. This popularity has been studied by analysis ofthe links between Web resources. Link-based page ranking models such as PageRank andHITS assign a global weight to each page regardless of its location. This popularitymeasurement has shown successful on general search engines. However unlike generalsearch engines; location-based search engines should retrieve and rank higher the pageswhich are more popular locally. The best results for a location-based query are those whichare not only relevant to the topic but also popular with or cited by local users. Currentranking models are often less effective for these queries since they are unable to estimatethe local popularity. We offer a model for calculating the local popularity of Web resources …,World Wide Web,2009,18
Pattern-based extraction of addresses from web page content,Saeid Asadi; Guowei Yang; Xiaofang Zhou; Yuan Shi; Boxuan Zhai; Wendy Wen-Rong Jiang,Abstract Extraction of addresses and location names from Web pages is a challenging taskfor search engines. Traditional information extraction and natural processing models remainunsuccessful in the context of the Web because of the uncontrolled heterogenous nature ofthe Web resources as well as the effects of HTML and other markup tags. We describe anew pattern-based approach for extraction of addresses from Web pages. Both HTML andvision-based segmentations are used to increase the quality of address extraction. Theproposed system uses several address patterns and a small table of geographic knowledgeto hit addresses and then itemize them into smaller components. The experiments show thatthis model can extract and itemize different addresses effectively without large gazetteers orhuman supervision.,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2008,18
Space efficient quantile summary for constrained sliding windows on a data stream,Jian Xu; Xuemin Lin; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract In many online applications; we need to maintain quantile statistics for a slidingwindow on a data stream. The sliding windows in natural form are defined as the mostrecent N data items. In this paper; we study the problem of estimating quantiles over othertypes of sliding windows. We present a uniform framework to process quantile queries fortime constrained and filter based sliding windows. Our algorithm makes one pass on thedata stream and maintains an ε-approximate summary. It uses O(1ϵ^2\log^2ϵN) spacewhere N is the number of data items in the window. We extend this framework to furtherprocess generalized constrained sliding window queries and proved that our technique isapplicable for flexible window settings.

Caching strategies for spatial joins,David J Abel; Volker Gaede; Robert A Power; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract The filter-and-refine strategy is well-established as the basis for spatial joinalgorithms. In contrast to the filter step; the refinement step has received little attention;despite contributing significantly to the total cost of a join evaluation. This paper reportsinvestigations of spatial join algorithms for z-ordering and R-trees; with particular emphasison interactions between choices of algorithms for the filter; sequencing and refinement stepsand on the effects of clustered and unclustered organization of full spatial descriptions ofobjects. Our experiments show that while it is in general desirable to introduce an additionalhousekeeping step to reduce I/O costs of the refinement step; it is not necessary in all cases.In addition; we propose a new caching strategy for spatial joins; called zig-zag; whichoutperforms its competitors in all but one case. These results suggest that spatial joins …,GeoInformatica,1999,18
STMaker: a system to make sense of trajectory data,Han Su; Kai Zheng; Kai Zeng; Jiamin Huang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Widely adoption of GPS-enabled devices generates large amounts of trajectoriesevery day. The raw trajectory data describes the movement history of moving objects by asequence of< longitude; latitude; time-stamp> triples; which are nonintuitive for human toperceive the prominent features of the trajectory; such as where and how the moving objecttravels. In this demo; we present the STMaker system to help users make sense of individualtrajectories. Given a trajectory; STMaker can automatically extract the significant semanticbehavior of the trajectory; and summarize the behavior by a short human-readable text. Inthis paper; we first introduce the phrases of generating trajectory summarizations; and thenshow several real trajectory summarization cases.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,17
Discovering the most influential sites over uncertain data: a rank-based approach,Kai Zheng; Zi Huang; Aoying Zhou; Xiaofang Zhou,With the rapidly increasing availability of uncertain data in many important applications suchas location-based services; sensor monitoring; and biological information managementsystems; uncertainty-aware query processing has received a significant amount of researcheffort from the database community in recent years. In this paper; we investigate a new typeof query in the context of uncertain databases; namely uncertain top-k influential sites query(UTkIS query for short); which can be applied in a wide range of application areas such asmarketing analysis and mobile services. Since it is not so straightforward to precisely definethe semantics of top-k query with uncertain data; in this paper we introduce a novel andmore intuitive formulation of the query on the basis of expected rank semantics.

Speed up interactive image retrieval,Heng Tao Shen; Shouxu Jiang; Kian-Lee Tan; Zi Huang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract In multimedia retrieval; a query is typically interactively refined towards the" optimal"answers by exploiting user feedback. However; in existing work; in each iteration; the refinedquery is re-evaluated. This is not only inefficient but fails to exploit the answers that may becommon between iterations. Furthermore; it may also take too many iterations to get the"optimal" answers. In this paper; we introduce a new approach called OptRFS (optimizingrelevance feedback search by query prediction) for iterative relevance feedback search.OptRFS aims to take users to view the" optimal" results as fast as possible. It optimizesrelevance feedback search by both shortening the searching time during each iteration andreducing the number of iterations. OptRFS predicts the potential candidates for the nextiteration and maintains this small set for efficient sequential scan. By doing so; repeated …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2009,17
Searching the world wide web for local services and facilities: A review on the patterns of location-based queries,Saeid Asadi; Chung-Yi Chang; Xiaofang Zhou; Joachim Diederich,Abstract Many queries sent to search engines refer to specific locations in the world.Location-based queries try to find local services and facilities around the user's environmentor in a particular area. This paper reviews the specifications of geospatial queries anddiscusses the similarities and differences between location-based queries and otherqueries. We introduce nine patterns for location-based queries containing either a servicename alone or a service name accompanied by a location name. Our survey indicates thatat least 22% of the Web queries have a geospatial dimension and most of these can beconsidered as location-based queries. We propose that location-based queries should betreated different from general queries to produce more relevant results.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2005,17
Direct mesh: a multiresolution approach to terrain visualization,Kai Xu; Xiaofang Zhou; Xuemin Lin,Terrain can be approximated by a triangular mesh consisting millions of 3D points.Multiresolution triangular mesh (MTM) structures are designed to support applications thatuse terrain data at variable levels of detail (LOD). Typically; an MTM adopts a tree structurewhere a parent node represents a lower-resolution approximation of its descendants. Givena region of interest (ROI) and a LOD; the process of retrieving the required terrain data fromthe database is to traverse the MTM tree from the root to reach all the nodes satisfying theROI and LOD conditions. This process; while being commonly used for multiresolutionterrain visualization; is inefficient as either a large number of sequential I/O operations orfetching a large amount of extraneous data is incurred. Various spatial indexes have beenproposed in the past to address this problem; however level-by-level tree traversal …,Data Engineering; 2004. Proceedings. 20th International Conference on,2004,17
Structure tensor series-based large scale near-duplicate video retrieval,Xiangmin Zhou; Lei Chen; Xiaofang Zhou,With the huge amount of video data and its exponential growth in recent years; many newchallenges; like storage; search and navigation; have arisen. Among these challenges; near-duplicate video retrieval aims to find clips that are identical or nearly identical in content to aquery clip. This has attracted much attention due to its wide applications including copyrightdetection; commercial monitoring and news video tracking. In this paper; we propose apractical solution based on 3-D structure tensor model for this problem. We first propose anovel video representation; adaptive structure video tensor series; together with a robustsimilarity measure; to improve the retrieval effectiveness. Then; we design a dimensionalityreduction technique for tensor series to improve the search efficiency. Finally; we prove theeffectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method by extensive experiments on …,IEEE Transactions on multimedia,2012,16
Improving backward recovery in workflow systems,Chengfei Liu; Maria Orlowska; Xuemin Lin; Xiaofang Zhou,The notion of compensation is widely used as means of backward recovery in long-livedtransactions as well as in business processes supported by workflow management systems.In general; it is non-trivial to design compensating tasks for tasks in the context of a workflow.Actually; a task does not have to be compensatable. In this paper; we first look into therequirements that a compensating task has to satisfy. Then we introduce a new mechanismcalled confirmation. With the help of confirmation; we can modify some non-compensatabletasks so that they become compensatable. This greatly improves backward recovery forworkflow applications in the case of failures.

Geo-SAGE: A geographical sparse additive generative model for spatial item recommendation,Weiqing Wang; Hongzhi Yin; Ling Chen; Yizhou Sun; Shazia Sadiq; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract With the rapid development of location-based social networks (LBSNs); spatial itemrecommendation has become an important means to help people discover attractive andinteresting venues and events; especially when users travel out of town. However; thisrecommendation is very challenging compared to the traditional recommender systems. Auser can visit only a limited number of spatial items; leading to a very sparse user-itemmatrix. Most of the items visited by a user are located within a short distance from wherehe/she lives; which makes it hard to recommend items when the user travels to a far awayplace. Moreover; user interests and behavior patterns may vary dramatically across differentgeographical regions. In light of this; we propose Geo-SAGE; a geographical sparse additivegenerative model for spatial item recommendation in this paper. Geo-SAGE considers …,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,15
A web-based approach to data imputation,Zhixu Li; Mohamed A Sharaf; Laurianne Sitbon; Shazia Sadiq; Marta Indulska; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract In this paper; we present WebPut; a prototype system that adopts a novel web-based approach to the data imputation problem. Towards this; Webput utilizes the availableinformation in an incomplete database in conjunction with the data consistency principle.Moreover; WebPut extends effective Information Extraction (IE) methods for the purpose offormulating web search queries that are capable of effectively retrieving missing values withhigh accuracy. WebPut employs a confidence-based scheme that efficiently leverages oursuite of data imputation queries to automatically select the most effective imputation queryfor each missing value. A greedy iterative algorithm is proposed to schedule the imputationorder of the different missing values in a database; and in turn the issuing of theircorresponding imputation queries; for improving the accuracy and efficiency of WebPut …,World Wide Web,2014,15
Core: A context-aware relation extraction method for relation completion,Zhixu Li; Mohamed A Sharaf; Laurianne Sitbon; Xiaoyong Du; Xiaofang Zhou,We identify relation completion (RC) as one recurring problem that is central to the successof novel big data applications such as Entity Reconstruction and Data Enrichment. Given asemantic relation ℜ; RC attempts at linking entity pairs between two entity lists under therelation ℜ. To accomplish the RC goals; we propose to formulate search queries for eachquery entity α based on some auxiliary information; so that to detect its target entity β fromthe set of retrieved documents. For instance; a pattern-based method (PaRE) uses extractedpatterns as the auxiliary information in formulating search queries. However; high-qualitypatterns may decrease the probability of finding suitable target entities. As an alternative; wepropose CoRE method that uses context terms learned surrounding the expression of arelation as the auxiliary information in formulating queries.

Database support for spatial generalisation for WWW and mobile applications,Xiaofang Zhou; Sham Prasher; Masaru Kitsuregawa,The need for using spatial vector data for Web-based and mobile applications has beenincreasing rapidly. Vector spatial data is difficult to generalise (that is; to derive a suitablelevel of detail; or LoD; of the data for a given application). In a client-server environment;excessive details of spatial data cannot always be appreciated on the client side; but couldconsume a significant amount of resources on both the server and the client side; not tomention the extra cost of data transfer. Spatial data generalisation has been investigatedextensively in the area of cartography. Most cartographical generalisation algorithms;however; are post-query operations where all the data; including unneeded data; isretrieved from the database for simplification. We incorporate spatial data simplificationalgorithms into query processing within DBMS. This novel approach targets primarily Web …,Web Information Systems Engineering; 2002. WISE 2002.

Using visual spatial search interface for WWW applications,Xiaofang Zhou; Joseph D Yates; Guihai Chen,Abstract Most Internet search engines are keyword-based. They are not efficient for thequeries where geographical location is important; such as finding hotels within an area orclose to a place of interest. A natural interface for spatial searching is a map; which can beused not only to display locations of search results but also to assist forming searchconditions. A map-based search engine requires a well-designed visual interface that isintuitive to use yet flexible and expressive enough to support various types of spatial queriesas well as aspatial queries. Similar to hyperlinks for text and images in an HTML page;spatial objects in a map should support hyperlinks. Such an interface needs to be scalablewith the size of the geographical regions and the number of websites it covers.

Group visible nearest neighbor queries in spatial databases,Hu Xu; Zhicheng Li; Yansheng Lu; Ke Deng; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Traditional nearest neighbor queries and its variants; such as Group NearestNeighbor Query (GNN); have been widely studied by many researchers. Recently obstaclesare involved in spatial queries. The existence of obstacles may affect the query results dueto the visibility of query point. In this paper; we propose a new type of query; Group VisibleNearest Neighbor Query (GVNN); which considers both visibility and distance as constraints.Multiple Traversing Obstacles (MTO) Algorithm and Traversing Obstacles Once (TOO)Algorithm are proposed to efficiently solve GVNN problem. TOO resolves GVNN by definingthe invisible region of MBR of query set to prune both data set and obstacle set; andtraverses obstacle R*-tree only once. The experiments with different settings show that TOOis more efficient and scalable than MTO.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2010,14

We briefly introduce some novel techniques developed fortwo specific tasks studied in this PhD project: video retrieval in a large collection ofsegmented video clips; and video subsequence identification from a long unsegmentedstream. The proposed methods for processing these two types of similarity queries haveshown encouraging performance and are being incorporated into our prototype system ofvideo search named UQLIPS; which has demonstrated some marketing potentials forcommercialisation.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,14
Efficient update and retrieval of objects in a multiresolution geospatial database,Sham Prasher; Xiaofang Zhou,Many emerging applications benefit from the extraction of geospatial data specified atdifferent resolutions for viewing purposes. Data must also be topologically accurate and up-to-date as it often represents real-world changing phenomena. Current multiresolutionschemes use complex opaque data types; which limit the capacity for in-database objectmanipulation. By using z-values and B/sup+/trees to support multiresolution retrieval; objectsare fragmented in such a way that updates to objects or object parts are executed usingstandard SQL (Structured Query Language) statements as opposed to procedural functions.Our approach is compared to a current model; using complex data types indexed under a3D (three-dimensional) R-tree; and shows better performance for retrieval over realisticwindow sizes and data loads. Updates with the R-tree are slower and preclude the …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2003. 15th International Conference on,2003,14

On spatial information retrieval and database generalization,Xiaofang Zhou; Yanchun Zhang; Sanglu Lu; Guihai Chen,Spatial data are often stored in a database with the finest level of details. The problem withcartographic generalization of spatial data is concerned with deriving spatial data withproper level of details when the data are used for an application. The generalization processis not simply a process of selecting objects or parts of objects suitable for an application; itshould maintain the semantic information carried with the spatial data; such as topologicalrelationships among objects and the overall" look and feel" of the data after generalization.Most difficulties of map generalization are because the importance of objects; whichdetermines whether an object should be included and how it should be visualized in thegeneralized data set; is decided not only by their size; but also the" meaning" of theseobjects to the application. The latter is application-dependent; and often subjective. With …,Digital Libraries: Research and Practice; 2000 Kyoto; International Conference on.,2000,14
Economic model-driven cloud service composition,Zhen Ye; Athman Bouguettaya; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract This article considers cloud service composition from a decision analysisperspective. Traditional QoS-aware composition techniques usually consider the qualitiesavailable at the time of the composition because compositions are usually immediatelyconsumed. This is fundamentally different in the cloud environment where the cloud servicecomposition typically lasts for a relatively long period of time. The two most important driverswhen composing cloud service are the long-term nature of the composition and theeconomic motivation for outsourcing tasks to the cloud. We propose an economic model;which we represent as a Bayesian network; to select and compose cloud services. We thenleverage influence diagrams to model the cloud service composition. We further extend thetraditional influence diagram problem to a hybrid one and adopt an extended Shenoy …,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT),2014,13
Location oriented phrase detection in microblogs,Saeid Hosseini; Sayan Unankard; Xiaofang Zhou; Shazia Sadiq,Abstract As a successful micro-blogging service; Twitter has demonstrated unprecedentedpopularity and international reach. Location extraction from micro-blogs (tweets) on thisdomain is an important challenge and can harness noisy but rich contents. Extractinglocation information can enable a variety of applications such as query-by-location; localadvertising; crises awareness and also systems designed to provide information aboutevents; points of interests (POIs) and landmarks. Considering the high throughput rate inTwitter space; we propose an approach to detect location-oriented phrases solely relying ontweet contents. The system finds associated phrases dedicated to each specific scalablegeographical area. We have evaluated our approach based on real-world Twitter datasetfrom Australia.

A term-based driven clustering approach for name disambiguation,Jia Zhu; Xiaofang Zhou; Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung,Abstract Name disambiguation in databases is a non-trivial task because people's namesare often not unique and usually only a limited information is associated with each name inthe database. For example; in DBLP many authors share the same name; whereas we donot have any unique identifier to distinguish them. To make it worst; we may not always beable to access the full contents of the materials; unless we have joined those organizations(eg ACM) who publish them. As such; how to disambiguate different names with a verylimited information is a very challenging task. In this paper; we focus ourselves on suchsituation. We propose a term-based driven clustering approach for solving it. Specifically; wefirst construct some term-based taxonomies to mimic the expert knowledge of the domain bylinking the related terms that appear in there automatically. Each taxonomy is then …,*,2009,13
Calculation of target locations for web resources,Saeid Asadi; Jiajie Xu; Yuan Shi; Joachim Diederich; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract A location-based search engine must be able to find and assign proper locations toWeb resources. Host; content and metadata location information are not sufficient todescribe the location of resources as they are ambiguous or unavailable for manydocuments. We introduce target location as the location of users of Web resources. Targetlocation is content-independent and can be applied to all types of Web resources. A novelmethod is introduced which uses log files and IPs to track the visitors of websites. Theexperiments show that target location can be calculated for almost all documents on theWeb at country level and to the majority of them in state and city levels. It can be assigned toWeb resources as a new definition and dimension of location. It can be used separately orwith other relevant locations to define the geography of Web resources.

Approximate processing of massive continuous quantile queries over high-speed data streams,Xuemin Lin; Jian Xu; Qing Zhang; Hongjun Lu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xiaofang Zhou; Yidong Yuan,Quantile computation has many applications including data mining and financial dataanalysis. It has been shown that an/spl epsi/-approximate summary can be maintained sothat; given a quantile query (/spl phi/;/spl epsi/); the data item at rank/spl lceil//spl phi/N/splrceil/may be approximately obtained within the rank error precision/spl epsi/N over all N dataitems in a data stream or in a sliding window. However; scalable online processing ofmassive continuous quantile queries with different/spl phi/and/spl epsi/poses a newchallenge because the summary is continuously updated with new arrivals of data items. Inthis paper; first we aim to dramatically reduce the number of distinct query results bygrouping a set of different queries into a cluster so that they can be processed virtually as asingle query while the precision requirements from users can be retained.

Texture segmentation based on features in wavelet domain for image retrieval,Ying Liu; Si Wu; Xiaofang Zhou,Texture is a fundamental feature which provides significant information for imageclassification; and is an important content used in content-based image retrieval (CBIR)system. To implement texture-based image database retrieval; texture segmentationtechniques are need to segment textured regions from arbitrary images in the database.Texture segmentation has been recognized as a difficult problem in image analysis. Thispaper proposed a block-wise automatic texture segmentation algorithm based on texturefeatures in wavelet domain. In this algorithm; texture features of each block are extractedand L2 distance between blocks are calculated; a pre-defined threshold is used todetermine if two blocks should be classified into same class; hence belong to same texturedregion. Results show that the proposed algorithm can efficiently catch the texture mosaics …,Visual Communications and Image Processing 2003,2003,13
Handling data skew in parallel hash join computation using two-phase scheduling,Xiaofang Zhou; Maria E Orlowska,A large number of parallel join algorithms has been proposed to maintain load-balancing inthe presence of data skew. However; one important type of data skew-join product skew(JPS)-has been little studied. In this paper; a dynamic parallel join algorithm; which employsa two-phase scheduling procedure; is designed to handle the JPS problem. Two sets ofscheduling heuristics are studied against various parameters. It is shown that many of theexisting algorithms can be regarded as a special case of our algorithm; whose cost is basedon the nature of data skew. While it can cope with JPS which other algorithms cannotapproach; it can be as efficient as most existing algorithms when JPS does not exist.,Algorithms and Architectures for Parallel Processing; 1995.

Multi-constrained graph pattern matching in large-scale contextual social graphs,Guanfeng Liu; Kai Zheng; Yan Wang; Mehmet A Orgun; An Liu; Lei Zhao; Xiaofang Zhou,Graph Pattern Matching (GPM) plays a significant role in social network analysis; which hasbeen widely used in; for example; experts finding; social community mining and socialposition detection. Given a pattern graph GQ and a data graph GD; a GPM algorithm findsthose subgraphs; GM; that match GQ in G D. However; the existing GPM methods do notconsider the multiple constraints on edges in GQ; which are commonly exist in variousapplications such as; crowdsourcing travel; social network based e-commerce and studygroup selection; etc. In this paper; we first conceptually extend Bounded Simulation to Multi-Constrained Simulation (MCS); and propose a novel NP-Complete Multi-Constrained GraphPattern Matching (MC-GPM) problem.

Exploring social influence on location-based social networks,Yu-Ting Wen; Po-Ruey Lei; Wen-Chih Peng; Xiao-Fang Zhou,Recently; with the advent of location-based social networking services (LBSNs); travelplanning and location-aware information recommendation based on LBSNs have attractedmuch research attention. In this paper; we study the impact of social relations hidden inLBSNs; ie; The social influence of friends. We propose a new social influence-based userrecommender framework (SIR) to discover the potential value from reliable users (ie; Closefriends and travel experts). Explicitly; our SIR framework is able to infer influential users froman LBSN. We claim to capture the interactions among virtual communities; physical mobilityactivities and time effects to infer the social influence between user pairs. Furthermore; weintend to model the propagation of influence using diffusion-based mechanism.

Augmenting image descriptions using structured prediction output,Yahong Han; Xingxing Wei; Xiaochun Cao; Yi Yang; Xiaofang Zhou,The need for richer descriptions of images arises in a wide spectrum of applications rangingfrom image understanding to image retrieval. While the Automatic Image Annotation (AIA)has been extensively studied; image descriptions with the output labels lack sufficientinformation. This paper proposes to augment image descriptions using structured predictionoutput. We define a hierarchical tree-structured semantic unit to describe images; from whichwe can obtain not only the class and subclass one image belongs to; but also the attributesone image has. After defining a new feature map function of structured SVM; we decomposethe loss function into every node of the hierarchical tree-structured semantic unit and thenpredict the tree-structured semantic unit for testing images. In the experiments; we evaluatethe performance of the proposed method on two open benchmark datasets and compare …,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,2014,12
AML: Efficient approximate membership localization within a web-based join framework,Zhixu Li; Laurianne Sitbon; Liwei Wang; Xiaofang Zhou; Xiaoyong Du,In this paper; we propose a new type of Dictionary-based Entity Recognition Problem;named Approximate Membership Localization (AML). The popular ApproximateMembership Extraction (AME) provides a full coverage to the true matched substrings from agiven document; but many redundancies cause a low efficiency of the AME process anddeteriorate the performance of real-world applications using the extracted substrings. TheAML problem targets at locating nonoverlapped substrings which is a better approximationto the true matched substrings without generating overlapped redundancies. In order toperform AML efficiently; we propose the optimized algorithm P-Prune that prunes a largepart of overlapped redundant matched substrings before generating them.

Finding alternative shortest paths in spatial networks,Kexin Xie; Ke Deng; Shuo Shang; Xiaofang Zhou; Kai Zheng,Abstract Shortest path query is one of the most fundamental queries in spatial networkdatabases. There exist algorithms that can process shortest path queries in real time.However; many complex applications require more than just the calculation of a singleshortest path. For example; one of the common ways to determine the importance (or price)of a vertex or an edge in spatial network is to use Vickrey pricing; which intuitively values thevertex v (or edge e) based on how much harder for travelling from the sources to thedestinations without using v (or e). In such cases; the alternative shortest paths without usingv (or e) are required. In this article; we propose using a precomputation based approach forboth single pair alternative shortest path and all pairs shortest paths processing. To computethe alternative shortest path between a source and a destination efficiently; a naïive way …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2012,12
I/O cost minimization: reachability queries processing over massive graphs,Zhiwei Zhang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lu Qin; Qing Zhu; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Given a directed graph G; a reachability query (u; v) asks whether there exists apath from a node u to a node v in G. The existing studies support reachability queries usingindexing techniques; where both the graph and the index are required to reside in mainmemory. However; they cannot handle reachability queries on massive graphs; when thegraph and the index cannot be entirely held in memory because of the high I/O cost. In thispaper; we focus on how to minimize the I/O cost when answering reachability queries onmassive graphs that cannot reside entirely in memory. First; we propose a new Yes-Labelscheme; as a complement of the No-Label used in GRAIL [23]; to reduce the number ofintermediate results generated. Second; we show how to minimize the number of I/Os usinga heap-on-disk data structure when traversing a graph. We also propose new methods to …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2012,12
Finding superior skyline points for multidimensional recommendation applications,Jing Yang; Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung; Wei Lu; Xiaofang Zhou; Hong Chen; Xiaoyong Du,Abstract In a typical Web recommendation system; objects are often described by manyattributes. It also needs to serve many users with a diversified range of preferences. In otherwords; it must be capable to efficiently support high dimensional preference queries thatallow the user to explore the data space effectively without imposing specific preferenceweightings for each dimension. The skyline query; which can produce a set of objectsguaranteed to contain all top ranked objects for any linear attribute preference combination;has been proposed to support this type of recommendation applications. However; it suffersfrom the problem known as 'dimensionality curse'as the size of skyline query result set cangrow exponentially with the number of dimensions. Therefore; when the dimensionality ishigh; a large percentage of objects can become skyline points. This problem makes such …,World Wide Web,2012,12

Locality condensation: a new dimensionality reduction method for image retrieval,Zi Huang; Heng Tao Shen; Jie Shao; Stefan Rüger; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Content-based image similarity search plays a key role in multimedia retrieval.Each image is usually represented as a point in a high-dimensional feature space. The keychallenge of searching similar images from a large database is the high computationaloverhead due to the" curse of dimensionality". Reducing the dimensionality is an importantmeans to tackle the problem. In this paper; we study dimensionality reduction for top-k imageretrieval. Intuitively; an effective dimensionality reduction method should not only preservethe close locations of similar images (or points); but also separate those dissimilar ones farapart in the reduced subspace. Existing dimensionality reduction methods mainly focusedon the former.

Efficient similarity search by summarization in large video database,Xiangmin Zhou; Xiaofang Zhou; Heng Tao Shen,Abstract With the explosion of video data; video processing technologies have advancedquickly and been applied into many fields; such as advertisements; medical etc.. To fastsearch these video data; an important issue is to effectively organize videos by datacompacting and indexing. However; practically; many useful distances for video comparisonare suitable to human perception; but non-metric. Therefore; traditional high dimensionaldata structures can not be utilized to index videos directly when non-metric measures areapplied. In this paper; we propose a compact video representation based on globalsummarization; by which each video in database is mapped into a digital string (a series ofcluster id). Consequently; the inter-frame similarity measure is transformed into inter-clustercomparison. Then; we propose an efficient index strategy based on sequence …,Proceedings of the eighteenth conference on Australasian database-Volume 63,2007,12

Microblog entity linking with social temporal context,Wen Hua; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Nowadays microblogging sites; such as Twitter and Chinese Sina Weibo; haveestablished themselves as an invaluable information source; which provides a hugecollection of manually-generated tweets with broad range of topics from daily life to breakingnews. Entity linking is indispensable for understanding and maintaining such information;which in turn facilitates many real-world applications such as tweet clustering andclassification; personalized microblog search; and so forth. However; tweets are short;informal and error-prone; rendering traditional approaches for entity linking in documentslargely inapplicable. Recent work addresses this problem by utilising information from othertweets and linking entities in a batch manner.

Sharkdb: An in-memory storage system for massive trajectory data,Haozhou Wang; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou; Shazia Sadiq,Abstract An increasing amount of motion history data; which is called trajectory; is beingcollected from different sources such as GPS-enabled mobile devices; surveillance camerasand social networks. However it is hard to store and manage trajectory data in traditionaldatabase systems; since its variable lengths and asynchronous sampling rates do not fit disk-based and tuple-oriented structures; which are the fundamental structures of traditionaldatabase systems. We implement a novel trajectory storage system that is motivated by thesuccess of column store and recent development of in-memory based databases. In thisstorage design; we try to explore the potential opportunities; which can boost theperformance of query processing for trajectory data.

Efficient provenance storage for relational queries,Zhifeng Bao; Henning Köhler; Liwei Wang; Xiaofang Zhou; Shazia Sadiq,Abstract Provenance information is vital in many application areas as it helps explain datalineage and derivation. However; storing fine-grained provenance information can beexpensive. In this paper; we present a framework for storing provenance information relatingto data derived via database queries. In particular; we first propose a provenance tree datastructure which matches the query structure and thereby presents a possibility to avoidredundant storage of information regarding the derivation process. Then we investigate twoapproaches for reducing storage costs. The first approach utilizes two ingenious rules toachieve reduction on provenance trees. The second one is a dynamic programmingsolution; which provides a way of optimizing the selection of query tree nodes whereprovenance information should be stored.

Location-based search engines tasks and capabilities: A comparative study,Saeid Asadi; Xiaofang Zhou; Hamid R Jamali; Hossein Vakili Mofrad,Location-based web searching is one of the popular tasks expected from the searchengines. A location-based query consists of a topic and a reference location. Unlike generalweb search; in location-based search it is expected to find and rank documents which arenot only related to the query topic but also geographically related to the location which thequery is associated with. There are several issues for developing effective geographicsearch engines and so far; no global location-based search engine has been reported.Location ambiguity; lack of geographic information on web pages; language-based andcountry-dependent addressing styles; and multiple locations related to a single webresource are notable difficulties.

Most existingimputation methods to string attribute values are inferring-based approaches; which usuallyfail to reach a high imputation recall by just inferring missing values from the complete part ofthe data set. Recently; some retrieving-based methods are proposed to retrieve missingvalues from external resources such as the World Wide Web; which tend to reach a muchhigher imputation recall; but inevitably bring a large overhead by issuing a large number ofsearch queries. In this paper; we investigate the interaction between the inferring-basedmethods and the retrieving-based methods. We show that retrieving a small number ofselected missing values can greatly improve the imputation recall of the inferring-basedmethods. With this intuition; we propose an inTeractive Retrieving-Inferring data …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,10
Efficient and continuous near-duplicate video detection,Qing Xie; Zi Huang; Heng Tao Shen; Xiaofang Zhou; Chaoyi Pang,Online video steam data is surging to an unprecedented level. Massive video publishingand sharing impose heavy demands on continuous video near-duplicate detection for manynovel video applications. This paper presents an accurate and accelerated system for videonear-duplicate detection over continuous video streams. We propose to transform a high-dimensional video stream into a one-dimensional Video Trend Stream (VTS) to monitor thecontinuous luminance changes of consecutive frames; based on which video similarity isderived. In order to do fast comparison and effective early pruning; a compact auxiliarysignature named CutSig is proposed to approximate the video structure. CutSig explores cutdistribution feature of the video structure and contributes to filter candidates quickly.

Online near-duplicate video clip detection and retrieval: An accurate and fast system,Zi Huang; Liping Wang; Heng Tao Shen; Jie Shao; Xiaofang Zhou,Video search has become a compelling research topic in recent years; due to theproliferation of online video uploading/sharing sites and the exponential explosion of videodata. In this demonstration; we showcase a Web-based integrated platform which performsonline detection of near-duplicate occurrences over continuous video streams; as well asretrieval of near-duplicate clips from segmented video collections. In particular; our methodto detect relevant subsequences in a streaming video is characterized by a novel one-dimensional distance trajectory capturing the changes of consecutive frames. Such atrajectory is further represented by a sequence of compact signatures. An effective similaritymeasure is devised to compare the trajectory with multiple query videos. This system showsa number of new features compared with our previous prototype.,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,10
Distribution-based similarity measures for multi-dimensional point set retrieval applications,Jie Shao; Zi Huang; Heng Tao Shen; Jialie Shen; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Effective and efficient method of similarity assessment continues to be one of themost fundamental problems in multimedia data analysis. In case of retrieving relevant itemsfrom a collection of objects based on series of multivariate observations (eg; searching thesimilar video clips in a repository to a query example); satisfactory performance cannot beexpected using many conventional similarity measures based on the aggregation of elementpairwise comparisons. Some correlation information among the individual elements hasalso been investigated to characterize each set of multi-dimensional points for rankedretrieval; by making use of an unwarranted assumption that the underlying data distributionhas a particular parametric form. Motivated by this observation; this paper introduces a novelcollective gauge of relevance ranking by evaluating the probabilities that point sets are …,Proceedings of the 16th ACM international conference on Multimedia,2008,10
Selectivity estimation by batch-query based histogram and parametric method,Jizhou Luo; Xiaofang Zhou; Yu Zhang; Heng Tao Shen; Jianzhong Li,Abstract Histograms are used extensively for selectivity estimation and approximate queryprocessing. Workload-aware dynamic histograms can self-tune itself based on queryfeedback without scanning or sampling the underlaying datasets in a systematic andcomprehensive way. Dynamic histograms allocate more buckets not only for the areas withmost skewed data distribution but also according to users' interest. However; it takes longtime to'warm-up'(ie; a large number of queries need to be processed before the histogramcan provide a satisfactory coverage and accuracy). Thus; it is less effective to adapt withworkload pattern changes. In this paper; we propose a novel online query schedulingalgorithm which can significantly reduce the warm-up time for dynamic histograms. Aparametric method is proposed to remedy the problem of inaccurate query selectivity …,Proceedings of the eighteenth conference on Australasian database-Volume 63,2007,10
Indexing and integrating multiple features for www images,Heng Tao Shen; Xiaofang Zhou; Bin Cui,Abstract In this paper; we present a novel indexing technique called Multi-scale SimilarityIndexing (MSI) to index image's multi-features into a single one-dimensional structure. Bothfor text and visual feature spaces; the similarity between a point and a local partition's centerin individual space is used as the indexing key; where similarity values in different featuresare distinguished by different scale. Then a single indexing tree can be built on these keys.Based on the property that relevant images have similar similarity values from the center ofthe same local partition in any feature space; certain number of irrelevant images can be fastpruned based on the triangle inequity on indexing keys. To remove the “dimensionalitycurse” existing in high dimensional structure; we propose a new technique called Local BitStream (LBS).

Semantic caching for web-based spatial applications,Sai Sun; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Client-side caching of spatial data is an important yet very much under investigatedissue. Effective caching of vector spatial data has the potential to greatly improve theperformance of spatial applications in the Web and wireless environments. In this paper; westudy the problem of semantic spatial caching; focusing on effective organization of spatialdata and spatial query trimming to take advantage of cached data. Semantic caching forspatial data is a much more complex problem than semantic caching for aspatial data.Several novel ideas are proposed in this paper for spatial applications. A number of typicalspatial application scenarios are used to generate spatial query sequences. An extensiveexperimental performance study is conducted based on these scenarios using real spatialdata. We demonstrate a significant performance improvement using our ideas.,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2005,10
Expansion-based algorithms for finding single pair shortest path on surface,Ke Deng; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Finding single pair shortest paths on surface is a fundamental problem in variousdomains; like Geographic Information Systems (GIS) 3D applications; robotic path planningsystem; and surface nearest neighbor query in spatial database; etc. Currently; to solve theproblem; existing algorithms must traverse the entire polyhedral surface. With the rapidadvance in areas like Global Positioning System (GPS); Computer Aided Design (CAD)systems and laser range scanner; surface models are becoming more and more complex. Itis not uncommon that a surface model contains millions of polygons. The single pair shortestpath problem is getting harder and harder to solve. Based on the observation that the singlepair shortest path is in the locality; we propose in this paper efficient methods by excludingpart of the surface model without considering them in the search process.

We first define the maximum overlapping (MO) order ina graph; proving that the problem of finding an MO order in a graph is NP-complete. Then;we propose an algorithm to find an approximation to MO order in a graph. We also provethat the approximation to MO order obtained from our method is close to the optimal result.Simulations have been conducted to demonstrate the saving of I/O cost in spatial join byusing our method.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2000,10
Generalisation of spatial data for web presentation,Xiaofang Zhou; Alex Krumm-Heller; Volker Gaede; Oracle Consulting Hannover,Abstract In spatial applications; it is often necessary to use spatial objects with varyingdegree of detail. As spatial objects are typically displayed in a way that allows human usersnot to discern unnecessary details; it would suffice to draw an abstraction of the spatial datapreserving its characteristics. Generalization; the process to derive such a less detailedrepresentation; may lead to a remarkable reduction of the computational overhead involvedwith displaying complex spatial objects. It can also benefit data transfer from one site toanother. With a growing number of interactive spatial applications on the web; spatial datageneralization becomes increasingly important. In this paper; we investigate how databasesystems can support generalization of spatial data. We introduce the concept of visualsignificance of spatial objects for interactive spatial applications; and discuss efficient …,Proceedings of the 2nd Asia Pacific Web Conference (APWeb’99).

Argument discovery via crowdsourcing,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen; Chi Thang Duong; Thanh Tam Nguyen; Matthias Weidlich; Karl Aberer; Hongzhi Yin; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract The amount of controversial issues being discussed on the Web has been growingdramatically. In articles; blogs; and wikis; people express their points of view in the form ofarguments; ie; claims that are supported by evidence. Discovery of arguments has a largepotential for informing decision-making. However; argument discovery is hindered by thesheer amount of available Web data and its unstructured; free-text representation. Theformer calls for automatic text-mining approaches; whereas the latter implies a need formanual processing to extract the structure of arguments. In this paper; we propose acrowdsourcing-based approach to build a corpus of arguments; an argumentation base;thereby mediating the trade-off of automatic text-mining and manual processing in argumentdiscovery.

Summarizing level-two topological relations in large spatial datasets,Xuemin Lin; Qing Liu; Yidong Yuan; Xiaofang Zhou; Hongjun Lu,Abstract Summarizing topological relations is fundamental to many spatial applicationsincluding spatial query optimization. In this article; we present several novel techniques toeffectively construct cell density based spatial histograms for range (window)summarizations restricted to the four most important level-two topological relations: contains;contained; overlap; and disjoint. We first present a novel framework to construct a multiscaleEuler histogram in 2D space with the guarantee of the exact summarization results foraligned windows in constant time. To minimize the storage space in such a multiscale Eulerhistogram; an approximate algorithm with the approximate ratio 19/12 is presented; whilethe problem is shown NP-hard generally.

Current web services technologies have been used successfully insome non data intensive distributed prototype systems. However; most of them can not workwell in data intensive environment. This paper provides an infrastructure layer in dataintensive environment for the effectively providing spatial information services by using theweb services over the Internet. We extensively investigate and analyze the overhead of webservices in data intensive environment; and propose some new optimization techniqueswhich can greatly increase the system's efficiency. Our experiments show that thesetechniques are suitable to data intensive environment. Finally; we present the requirement ofthese techniques for the information of web services over the Internet.,Asia-Pacific web conference,2006,9
Dynamic multi-resolution spatial object derivation for mobile and WWW applications,Sham Prasher; Xiaofang Zhou; Masaru Kitsuregawa,Abstract Online geographic information systems provide the means to extract a subset ofdesired spatial information from a larger remote repository. Data retrieved representing real-world geographic phenomena are then manipulated to suit the specific needs of an end-user. Often this extraction requires the derivation of representations of objects specific to aparticular resolution or scale from a single original stored version. Currently standard spatialdata handling techniques cannot support the multi-resolution representation of such featuresin a database. In this paper a methodology to store and retrieve versions of spatial objects atdifferent resolutions with respect to scale using standard database primitives and SQL ispresented. The technique involves heavy fragmentation of spatial features that allowsdynamic simplification into scale-specific object representations customised to the display …,World Wide Web,2003,9
Possible and certain keys for SQL,Henning Köhler; Uwe Leck; Sebastian Link; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Driven by the dominance of the relational model and the requirements of modernapplications; we revisit the fundamental notion of a key in relational databases with NULL. InSQL; primary key columns are NOT NULL; and UNIQUE constraints guarantee uniquenessonly for tuples without NULL. We investigate the notions of possible and certain keys; whichare keys that hold in some or all possible worlds that originate from an SQL table;respectively. Possible keys coincide with UNIQUE; thus providing a semantics for theirsyntactic definition in the SQL standard. Certain keys extend primary keys to include NULLcolumns and can uniquely identify entities whenever feasible; while primary keys may not.

Keyword-aware continuous knn query on road networks,Bolong Zheng; Kai Zheng; Xiaokui Xiao; Han Su; Hongzhi Yin; Xiaofang Zhou; Guohui Li,It is nowadays quite common for road networks to have textual contents on the vertices;which describe auxiliary information (eg; business; traffic; etc.) associated with the vertex. Insuch road networks; which are modelled as weighted undirected graphs; each vertex isassociated with one or more keywords; and each edge is assigned with a weight; which canbe its physical length or travelling time. In this paper; we study the problem of keyword-aware continuous k nearest neighbour (KCkNN) search on road networks; which computesthe k nearest vertices that contain the query keywords issued by a moving object andmaintains the results continuously as the object is moving on the road network.

Maximum error-bounded Piecewise Linear Representation for online stream approximation,Qing Xie; Chaoyi Pang; Xiaofang Zhou; Xiangliang Zhang; Ke Deng,Abstract Given a time series data stream; the generation of error-bounded Piecewise LinearRepresentation (error-bounded PLR) is to construct a number of consecutive line segmentsto approximate the stream; such that the approximation error does not exceed a prescribederror bound. In this work; we consider the error bound in L_ ∞ L∞ norm as approximationcriterion; which constrains the approximation error on each corresponding data point; andaim on designing algorithms to generate the minimal number of segments. In the literature;the optimal approximation algorithms are effectively designed based on transformed spaceother than time-value space; while desirable optimal solutions based on original timedomain (ie; time-value space) are still lacked. In this article; we proposed two linear-timealgorithms to construct error-bounded PLR for data stream based on time domain; which …,The VLDB Journal,2014,8
Computing unrestricted synopses under maximum error bound,Chaoyi Pang; Qing Zhang; Xiaofang Zhou; David Hansen; Sen Wang; Anthony Maeder,Abstract Constructing Haar wavelet synopses with guaranteed maximum error on dataapproximations has many real world applications. In this paper; we take a novel approachtowards constructing unrestricted Haar wavelet synopses under maximum error metrics(L∞). We first provide two linear time (log N)-approximation algorithms which have spacecomplexities of O (log N) and O (N) respectively. These two algorithms have the advantageof being both simple in structure and naturally adaptable for stream data processing. Unliketraditional approaches for synopses construction that rely heavily on examining waveletcoefficients and their summations; the proposed methods are very compact and scalable;and sympathetic for online data processing. We then demonstrate that this technique can beextended to other findings such as Haar+ tree. Extensive experiments indicate that these …,Algorithmica,2013,8

A new indexing method for high dimensional dataset,Jiyuan An; Yi-Ping Phoebe Chen; Qinying Xu; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Indexing high dimensional datasets has attracted extensive attention from manyresearchers in the last decade. Since R-tree type of index structures are known as suffering“curse of dimensionality” problems; Pyramid-tree type of index structures; which are basedon the B-tree; have been proposed to break the curse of dimensionality. However; for highdimensional data; the number of pyramids is often insufficient to discriminate data pointswhen the number of dimensions is high. Its effectiveness degrades dramatically with theincrease of dimensionality. In this paper; we focus on one particular issue of “curse ofdimensionality”; that is; the surface of a hypercube in a high dimensional space approaches100% of the total hypercube volume when the number of dimensions approaches infinite.We propose a new indexing method based on the surface of dimensionality.

High dimensional indexing for protein structure matching using bowties,Zi H Huang; Xiaofang Zhou; Dawei Song,Abstract For determining functionality dependencies between two proteins; both representedas 3D structures; it is an essential condition that they have a matching structure. As 3Dstructures for proteins are large; complex and constantly evolving; it is very time-consumingto identify possible locations and sizes of such a matching structure for a given proteinagainst a large protein database. In this paper; we introduce a novel representation modeland apply a transformation and formalization to this problem. We then propose a databasesolution by using innovative high dimensional indexing mechanisms. Experimental resultsdemonstrate a promising performance of the high dimensional indexing to this biologicallycritical but previously computationally prohibitive problem.,*,2005,8
A simple texture descriptor for texture retrieval,Ying Liu; Xiaofang Zhou,Texture feature extraction is an important part in content-based image retrieval system. Thispaper describes a simple and effective texture feature extraction algorithm. Previous workbased on image decomposition techniques usually use mean and variance of eachsubband in decomposition domain to form texture descriptor. The proposed texturedescriptor uses the variance information and the luminance property of the texture to formthe descriptor. Experimental results on the Brodatz texture database show that the proposeddescriptor can provide comparable retrieval performance with approximately only half thenumber of features used compared with previous work.,Communication Technology Proceedings; 2003.

A declustering algorithm for minimising spatial join cost,Yanchun Zhang; Jitian Xiao; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Spatial joins are important; yet time-consuming operations in spatial databases. Inthis paper we consider to minimise the I/O cost for the spatial join processing. A graph modelis proposed to formalise the cost; and an algorithm originally proposed for distributeddatabase design is adapted for spatial object declustering. We improve the algorithm bygiving special consideration to the clusters with overlapped objects. Our algorithm can notonly reduce the number of objects fetched from disk for refinement processing; but also becomputationally more efficient than the previous algorithms.,International Computing and Combinatorics Conference,1997,8
Resequencing and clustering to improve the performance of spatial join,David J Abel; Volker Gaede; Robert A Power; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract. The lter-and-re ne strategy is well-established as the basis for spatial joinalgorithms. In contrast to the lter step; the re nement step has received little attention; despitecontributing signi cantly to the total cost of a join evaluation. Sorting candidate tuples asproduced by the lter step has recently been shown to reduce the I/O cost of re nement. Ourpaper reports investigations of spatial join algorithms; with particular emphasis oninteractions between choices of algorithms for the lter; sequencing and re nement steps andon the e ects of clustered and unclustered organization of full spatial descriptions of objects.We extend existing techniques by caching spatial descriptions and a new sorting strategy;called zig-zag.

Discovering Meaningful Certain Keys from Incomplete and Inconsistent Relations.,Henning Köhler; Sebastian Link; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Completeness and consistency are two important dimensions for the quality of data;in particular relational data. This is true because most data sets found in practice are bothincomplete and inconsistent. The simplest yet arguably most important integrity constraintare keys. Recently; certain keys were introduced for incomplete relations. Certain keys canefficiently manage the integrity of entities while still permitting incompleteness in columns ofthe key. It is therefore an important task to discover the set of certain keys that hold in a givenincomplete relation. However; if the given incomplete relation is also inconsistent withrespect to some meaningful certain keys; algorithms that discover keys cannot succeed. Asmeaningful keys are likely to have a small number of violations; we propose an algorithmthat discovers certain keys that do not exceed a given number of violations. We illustrate …,IEEE Data Eng.

Scheduling with freshness and performance guarantees for web applications in the cloud,Yingying Zhu; Mohamed A Sharaf; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Highly distributed data management platforms (eg; PNUTS; Dynamo; Cassandra;and BigTable) are rapidly becoming the favorite choice for hosting modern web applicationsin the cloud. Among other features; these platforms rely on data partitioning; replication andrelaxed consistency to achieve high levels of performance and scalability. However; thesedesign choices often exhibit a trade-off between performance and data freshness. In thispaper; in addition to performance SLAs; we also perceive an application tolerance to datastaleness as another requirement determining the end-user satisfaction and our goal is tostrike a fine balance between both the quality of service (QoS) and quality of data (QoD)perceived by the end-user. Towards that; we propose scheduling policies and mechanismsfor efficiently allocating the recourses at each replica node so that to meet the conflicting …,Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Australasian Database Conference-Volume 115,2011,7

In this paper; we investigate the problem ofinformation retrieval in a mobile peer-to-peer network. The prevailing approach toinformation retrieval is to apply flooding methods because of its quick response and easymaintenance. Obviously; this kind of approach wastes a huge amount of communicationbandwidth which greatly affects the availability of the network; and the battery power whichsignificantly shortens the serving time of mobile devices in the network.

Dynamic batch nearest neighbor search in video retrieval,Jie Shao; Zi Huang; Heng Tao Shen; Xiaofang Zhou; Yijun Li,To retrieve similar database videos to a query clip; each video is typically represented by asequence of high-dimensional feature vectors. Given a query video containing m featurevectors; an independent nearest neighbor (NN) search for each feature vector is often firstperformed. Completing all the NN searches; an overall similarity is then computed; ie; asingle video retrieval usually involves the searches for m times. Since normally nearbyfeature vectors in a video are similar; a large number of expensive random disk accessesare expected to repeatedly occur; which crucially affects the overall query performance.Batch nearest neighbor (BNN) search is stated as a single operation that performs a batch ofindividual NN searches.

Data declustering and cluster ordering technique for spatial join scheduling,Jitian Xiao; Yanchun Zhang; Xiaohua Jia; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract The spatial join operations combine two sets of spatial data by their spatialrelationships. They are the most expensive operations; yet among the most commonoperations in spatial databases. In this paper we investigate the optimization issue throughdata declustering. A graph model is developed to formalise the problem; and then a matrix-based data partitioning method is proposed for declustering the nonuniform spatial data.The clusters produced are also ordered with maximum-overlapping. When inputing theclusters in this order for spatial joins; the I/O cost can be reduced significantly. Theexperimental work has shown that 15–35% saving can be achieved when comparing withsome existing methods.,*,2000,7
Understand short texts by harvesting and analyzing semantic knowledge,Wen Hua; Zhongyuan Wang; Haixun Wang; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,Understanding short texts is crucial to many applications; but challenges abound. First; shorttexts do not always observe the syntax of a written language. As a result; traditional naturallanguage processing tools; ranging from part-of-speech tagging to dependency parsing;cannot be easily applied. Second; short texts usually do not contain sufficient statisticalsignals to support many state-of-the-art approaches for text mining such as topic modeling.Third; short texts are more ambiguous and noisy; and are generated in an enormousvolume; which further increases the difficulty to handle them. We argue that semanticknowledge is required in order to better understand short texts. In this work; we build aprototype system for short text understanding which exploits semantic knowledge providedby a well-known knowledgebase and automatically harvested from a web corpus.

Cardinality constraints on qualitatively uncertain data,Neil Hall; Henning Koehler; Sebastian Link; Henri Prade; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Modern applications require advanced techniques and tools to process largevolumes of uncertain data. For that purpose we introduce cardinality constraints as aprincipled tool to control the occurrences of uncertain data. Uncertainty is modeledqualitatively by assigning to each object a degree of possibility by which the object occurs inan uncertain instance. Cardinality constraints are assigned a degree of certainty thatstipulates on which objects they hold. Our framework empowers users to model uncertaintyin an intuitive way; without the requirement to put a precise value on it. Our class ofcardinality constraints enjoys a natural possible world semantics; which is exploited toestablish several tools to reason about them.

In our work; PET resins grafted with poly (acrylicacid)(PAA); termed as PET-g-PAA; were first prepared through γ-ray radiation induced graftpolymerization and blended in a partially miscible PET/ethylene-methyl acrylate-glycidylmethacrylate random terpolymer (ST2000) system as the compatibilizer. The impact strengthof the PET blends achieves the maximum at a 6 wt% of PET-g-PAA; but without the loss oftensile strength. Furthermore; much less of ST2000 is needed for the blends to possess highimpact strength at the existence of PET-g-PAA.

In this work; in addition to latency-based SLAs; we also adopt the application tolerance to data staleness as anotherrequirement determining the end-user satisfaction and our goal is to strike a fine balancebetween both the QoS and QoD provided to the end-user. Towards achieving that goal; wepropose a suite of quality-aware schedulers for efficiently allocating the necessarycomputational resources between the foreground user-queries and the background …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2014,6
Cardinality constraints for uncertain data,Henning Koehler; Sebastian Link; Henri Prade; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Modern applications require advanced techniques and tools to process largevolumes of uncertain data. For that purpose we introduce cardinality constraints as aprincipled tool to control the occurrences of uncertain data. Uncertainty is modeledqualitatively by assigning to each object a degree of possibility by which the object occurs inan uncertain instance. Cardinality constraints are assigned a degree of certainty thatstipulates on which objects they hold. Our framework empowers users to model uncertaintyin an intuitive way; without the requirement to put a precise value on it. Our class ofcardinality constraints enjoys a natural possible world semantics; which is exploited toestablish several tools to reason about them. We characterize the associated implicationproblem axiomatically and algorithmically in linear input time. Furthermore; we show how …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2014,6
Ranking based activity trajectory search,Wei Chen; Lei Zhao; Xu Jiajie; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract With the proliferation of the GPS-enabled devices and mobile techniques; there hasbeen a lot of work on trajectory search in the last decade. Previous trajectory search hasfocused on spatio-temporal features and text descriptions. Different from them; we study anovel problem of searching trajectories with activities and corresponding rankinginformation. Given a query q; which is attached with a set of activities and a threshold ofdistance; the results of ranking based activity trajectory search (RTS) are k trajectories suchthat the given activities are performed with the highest ranking within the threshold ofdistance. In addition; we also extend the query with an order; ie; order-sensitive rankingbased activity trajectory search (ORTS); which takes both the order of activities in a query qand the order of trajectories into account. It is challenging to answer RTS and ORTS …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2014,6
A data driven approach for discovering data quality requirements,Ruojing Zhang; Vimukthi Jayawardene; Marta Indulska; Shazia Sadiq; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Existing methodologies for identifying data quality issues are inevitably user-centric;wherein data quality requirements are determined in a top-down manner followingorganizational structures and data governance frameworks. In the current data landscape;however; users are often confronted with new; unexplored data sets that may haverelevance and potential to create value. In such scenarios applying top-down approaches isnot feasible. Users need to be empowered with data exploration capabilities that allow themto investigate and understand the quality of data sets and; subsequently; the implications foruse. The question is to what extent can the quality of a data set be explored in a bottom upmanner without access to well defined data quality measures. Accordingly; in this paper wepresent an approach for discovering data quality issues using generic exploratory …,*,2014,6
Efficient subsequence matching over large video databases,Xiangmin Zhou; Xiaofang Zhou; Lei Chen; Athman Bouguettaya,Abstract Video similarity matching has broad applications such as copyright detection; newstracking and commercial monitoring; etc. Among these applications; one typical task is todetect the local similarity between two videos without the knowledge on positions andlengths of each matched subclip pair. However; most studies so far on video detectioninvestigate the global similarity between two short clips using a pre-defined distancefunction. Although there are a few works on video subsequence detection; all theseproposals fail to provide an effective query processing mechanism. In this paper; we firstgeneralize the problem of video similarity matching. Then; a novel solution called consistentkeyframe matching (CKM) is proposed to solve the problem of subsequence matchingbased on video segmentation. CKM is designed with two goals:(1) good scalability in …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2012,6
Hybrid retrieval mechanisms in vehicle-based P2P networks,Quanqing Xu; Heng Tao Shen; Zaiben Chen; Bin Cui; Xiaofang Zhou; Yafei Dai,Abstract Mobile P2P networks have potential applications in many fields; making them afocus of current research. However; mobile P2P networks are subject to the limitations oftransmission range; wireless bandwidth; and highly dynamic network topology; giving rise tomany new challenges for efficient search. In this paper; we propose a hybrid searchapproach; which is automatic and economical in mobile P2P networks. The region coveredby a mobile P2P network is partitioned into subregions; each of which can be identified by aunique ID and known to all peers. All the subregions then construct a mobile Kademlia(MKad) network. The proposed hybrid retrieval approach aims to utilize flooding-based andDHT-based schemes in MKad for indexing and searching according to designed utilityfunctions.

Content-Based Video Search: is there a need; and is it possible?,Zi Huang; Yijun Li; Jie Shao; Heng Tao Shen; Liping Wang; Danqing Zhang; Xiangmin Zhou; Xiaofang Zhou,There is a large and rapidly increasing amount of video data on the Internet and in personalor organizational collections. Fast and accurate video search emerges to be an importantissue. The need and main technical challenges for video retrieval are similar to those for thecontent-based image retrieval (CBIR) problem. Lack of meaningful and comprehensive textannotation means that an approach based on content similarity can be promising; and thedifferences between an often high-level search intention and the low-level features used incontent-based search techniques suggest that content-based video retrieval (CBVR) mayalso suffer from" semantic gap" issues. In this paper; we analyze the problem of CBVR fromrelated work in the literature as well as some current work in our team; focusing on therelationship between CBIR and CBVR; open yet well-defined research issues and …,Information-Explosion and Next Generation Search; 2008.

A new similarity measure for near duplicate video clip detection,Xiangmin Zhou; Xiaofang Zhou; Heng Tao Shen,Abstract Near-duplicate video clip (NDVC) detection is a special issue of content-basedvideo search. Identifying the videos derived from the same original source is the primary taskof this research. In NDVC detection; an important step is to define an effective similaritymeasure that captures both frame and sequence information inherent to the video clips. Toaddress this; in this paper; we propose a new similarity measure; named as Video EditDistance (VED); that adopts a complementary information compensation scheme based onthe visual features and sequence context of videos. Visual features contain thediscriminative information of each video; and sequence context captures the featurevariation of it. To reduce the computation cost of inter-video comparison by VED; we extractkey frames from video sequences and map each key frame into one single symbol …,*,2007,6
Dimensionality reduction in patch-signature based protein structure matching,Zi Huang; Xiaofang Zhou; Dawei Song; Peter Bruza,Abstract Searching bio-chemical structures is becoming an important application domain ofinformation retrieval. This paper introduces a protein structure matching problem andformulates it as an information retrieval problem. We first present a novel vectorrepresentation for protein structures; in which a protein structural region; formed by thevectors within the region; is defined as a patch and indexed by its patch signature. For a k-sized patch; its patch signature consists of 7k-10 inter-atom distances which uniquelydetermine the patch's spatial structure. A patch matching function is then defined. Asstructures for proteins are large and complex; it is computationally expensive to identifypossible matching patches for a given protein against a large protein database. We proposeto apply dimensionality reduction to the patch signatures and show how the two problems …,Proceedings of the 17th Australasian Database Conference-Volume 49,2006,6
Semantic caching for multiresolution spatial query processing in mobile environments,Sai Sun; Xiaofang Zhou; Heng Tao Shen,Abstract Spatial data are particularly useful in mobile environments. However; due to the lowbandwidth of most wireless networks; developing large spatial database applicationsbecomes a challenging process. In this paper; we provide the first attempt to combine twoimportant techniques; multiresolution spatial data structure and semantic caching; towardsefficient spatial query processing in mobile environments. Based on the study of thecharacteristics of multiresolution spatial data (MSD) and multiresolution spatial query; wepropose a new semantic caching model called Multiresolution Semantic Caching (MSC) forcaching MSD in mobile environments. MSC enriches the traditional three-category queryprocessing in semantic cache to five categories; thus improving the performance in threeways: 1) a reduction in the amount and complexity of the remainder queries; 2) the …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2005,6
Exploiting viral marketing for location promotion in location-based social networks,Wen-Yuan Zhu; Wen-Chih Peng; Ling-Jyh Chen; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract With the explosion of smartphones and social network services; location-basedsocial networks (LBSNs) are increasingly seen as tools for businesses (eg; restaurants andhotels) to promote their products and services. In this article; we investigate the keytechniques that can help businesses promote their locations by advertising wisely throughthe underlying LBSNs. In order to maximize the benefit of location promotion; we formalize itas an influence maximization problem in an LBSN; ie; given a target location and an LBSN;a set of k users (called seeds) should be advertised initially such that they can successfullypropagate and attract many other users to visit the target location. Existing studies haveproposed different ways to calculate the information propagation probability; that is; howlikely it is that a user may influence another; in the setting of a static social network …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2016,5
Optimizing cost of continuous overlapping queries over data streams by filter adaption,Qing Xie; Xiangliang Zhang; Zhixu Li; Xiaofang Zhou,The problem we aim to address is the optimization of cost management for executingmultiple continuous queries on data streams; where each query is defined by several filters;each of which monitors certain status of the data stream. Specially; the filter can be sharedby different queries and expensive to evaluate. The conventional objective for such aproblem is to minimize the overall execution cost to solve all queries; by planning the orderof filter evaluation in shared strategy. However; in the streaming scenario; the characteristicsof data items may change in process; which can bring some uncertainty to the outcome ofindividual filter evaluation; and affect the plan of query execution as well as the overallexecution cost. In our work; considering the influence of the uncertain variation of datacharacteristics; we propose a framework to deal with the dynamic adjustment of filter …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,5

Rating propagation in web services reputation systems: A fast shapley value approach,An Liu; Qing Li; Xiaofang Zhou; Lu Li; Guanfeng Liu; Yunjun Gao,Abstract A new challenge in Web services reputation systems is to update the reputation ofcomponent services. As an emerging solution; rating propagation has received muchattention recently. Current rating propagation algorithms either fail to fairly distribute theoverall rating to component services or can realize a fair rating distribution at the cost ofexponential time complexity. In this paper; we propose a fast Shapley value approach topropagate the overall rating of a composite service to its component services. Our approachensures the fairness of rating propagation by using the advantage of the Shapley value; butsignificantly decreases its computational complexity from exponential to quadratic. Itsfairness and efficiency are validated by experiments.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2014,5
A crowd-based route recommendation system-crowdplanner,Han Su; Kai Zheng; Jiamin Huang; Tianyu Liu; Haozhou Wang; Xiaofang Zhou,Route recommendation service has become a big business in industry since traveling isnow an important part of our daily life. We can travel to unknown places by simply typing inour destination and then following recommendation service's guidance; that a pleasant tripdesires them to provide a good route. However; previous research shows that even theroutes recommended by the big-thumb service providers can deviate significantly from theroutes travelled by experienced drivers since the many latent factors affect drivers'preferences and it is hard for a single route recommendation algorithm to model all of them.In this demo we will present the CrowPlanner system to leverage crowds' knowledge toimprove the recommendation quality.

Such design choices typically exhibit atradeoff in which data freshness is sacrificed in favor of reduced access latencies. In thiswork; we argue that the same tradeoff is further manifested at a local-level (ie; replica-level)and is primarily shaped by the resource allocation strategies deployed for managing theprocessing of user queries and replica updates. To this end; we study several strategies forefficiently allocating such recourses so that to strike a fine balance between both the qualityof service (QoS) and quality of data (QoD) perceived by the end-user.,Proceedings of the fourth international workshop on Cloud data management,2012,5

Pattern-based moving object tracking,Kuien Liu; Ke Deng; Zhiming Ding; Xiaofang Zhou; Mingshu Li,Abstract Monitoring the locations of a large number of objects that travel in a certain space isa popular problem for its importance in various application scenarios. It brings us achallenge of how to efficiently handle large volumes of location updates required toguarantee the error bound among an object's current; actual location and its current locationin the tracking system. Current solutions predict the future locations based on the recentmovements of the moving object. However; it is reliable to predict the position in near futureonly and the prediction accuracy is poor in the long term.

High-dimensional indexing is a primary approach to achieve quick retrieval. Inthis paper; we present an optimal one-dimensional indexing method which can maximallypreserve the original inter-distance between two high-dimensional feature vectors. Such atransformation enables B+-tree to achieve its optimal performance.

Achieving effective multi-term queries for fast DHT information retrieval,Quanqing Xu; Heng Tao Shen; Yafei Dai; Bin Cui; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) are well-suited for exact match look-ups usingunique identifiers; but do not directly support multi-term queries. Related research of queryexpansion has shown that adding new terms to a query via ad hoc feedback improves theretrieval effectiveness of such query. In the paper; we propose an effective multi-term queryprocessing algorithm for information retrieval in DHT systems. Given the significance of firstterm in a multi-term query; the query is sent to the peers containing the first term. To enhancethe query effectiveness; we design two query expansion mechanisms and an implicitrelevance feedback approach based on users' behaviors. Additionally; we record the querylog and the expansion terms for each query which can accelerate the future queries andimprove the query accuracy.

The last several years have brought forth several newtechnologies to service this need-semantic Web; grid systems; Web service composition tomention a few. However; a fundamental underpinning of the success of these technologiesresides in the quality of data that they can provide. Often the failure of a technology isattributed to its functionality when the real problem lies in the quality of data it uses andsubsequently produces.

Filtering duplicate items over distributed data streams,Tian Xia; Cheqing Jin; Xiaofang Zhou; Aoying Zhou,Abstract In recent years many real time applications need to handle data streams. Weconsider the distributed environments in which remote data sources keep on collecting datafrom real world or from other data sources; and continuously push the data to a centralstream processor. In these kinds of environments; significant communication is induced bythe transmitting of rapid; high-volume and time-varying data streams. At the same time; thecomputing overhead at the central processor is also incurred. In this paper; we develop anovel filter approach; called DTFilter approach; for evaluating the windowed distinct queriesin such a distributed system. DTFilter approach is based on the searching algorithm using adata structure of two height-balanced trees; and it avoids transmitting duplicate items in datastreams; thus lots of network resources are saved.

Thesedata are typically collected; stored and used by different custodians for very specificpurposes. The full benefits of using spatial data can be achieved by combining the data fromdifferent sources covering a common region. It is; however; a great challenge to use thespatial data collected and organized for one purpose for other purposes.

Discrete Multimodal Hashing With Canonical Views for Robust Mobile Landmark Search,Lei Zhu; Zi Huang; Xiaobai Liu; Xiangnan He; Jiande Sun; Xiaofang Zhou,Mobile landmark search (MLS) recently receives increasing attention for its great practicalvalues. However; it still remains unsolved due to two important challenges. One is highbandwidth consumption of query transmission; and the other is the huge visual variations ofquery images sent from mobile devices. In this paper; we propose a novel hashing scheme;named as canonical view based discrete multimodal hashing (CV-DMH); to handle theseproblems. First; a submodular function is designed to measure visual representativenessand redundancy of a view set. With it; canonical views; which capture key visualappearances of landmark with limited redundancy; are efficiently discovered with an iterativemining strategy. Second; multimodal sparse coding is applied to transform visual featuresfrom multiple modalities into an intermediate representation. It can robustly and …,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,2017,4

A basic spatial query in POI database is POI retrieval. In many scenarios; auser cannot provide enough information to pinpoint the POI except some clue. For example;a user wants to identify a café in a city visited many years ago.

A spatial-temporal topic model for the semantic annotation of POIs in LBSNs,Tieke He; Hongzhi Yin; Zhenyu Chen; Xiaofang Zhou; Shazia Sadiq; Bin Luo,Abstract Semantic tags of points of interest (POIs) are a crucial prerequisite for locationsearch; recommendation services; and data cleaning. However; most POIs in location-basedsocial networks (LBSNs) are either tag-missing or tag-incomplete. This article aims todevelop semantic annotation techniques to automatically infer tags for POIs. We first analyzetwo LBSN datasets and observe that there are two types of tags; category-related ones andsentimental ones; which have unique characteristics. Category-related tags are hierarchical;whereas sentimental ones are category-aware. All existing related work has adoptedclassification methods to predict high-level category-related tags in the hierarchy; but theycannot apply to infer either low-level category tags or sentimental ones.

Cost-efficient spatial network partitioning for distance-based query processing,Jiping Wang; Kai Zheng; Hoyoung Jeung; Haozhou Wang; Bolong Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,The efficiency of spatial query processing is crucial for many applications such as location-based services. In spatial networks; queries like k-NN queries are all based on networkdistance evaluation. Classic solutions for these queries rely on network expansion and arenot efficient enough for large networks. Some approaches have improved the queryefficiency but brought considerable space cost for index. To address these problems; wepropose a hierarchical graph partitioning based index named Partition Tree. It organizes thevertices of a spatial network into a hierarchy through a series of graph partitioningprocesses. Meanwhile precomputed distances are associated with this hierarchy to facilitateefficient query processing.

Saqr: An efficient scheme for similarity-aware query refinement,Abdullah Albarrak; Mohamed A Sharaf; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Query refinement techniques enable database systems to automatically adjust asubmitted query so that its result satisfies some specified constraints. While currenttechniques are fairly successful in generating refined queries based on cardinalityconstraints; they are rather oblivious to the (dis) similarity between the input query and itscorresponding refined version. Meanwhile; enforcing a similarity-aware query refinement isa rather challenging task as it would require an exhaustive examination of the large space ofpossible query refinements. To address this challenge; we propose a novel scheme forefficient Similarity-aware Query Refinement (SAQR). SAQR aims to balance the tradeoffbetween satisfying the cardinality and similarity constraints imposed on the refined query sothat to maximize its overall benefit to the user.

Whilemost skyline query processing algorithms are designed based on the assumption that queryprocessing is done for all attributes in a static dataset with deterministic attribute values;some advanced work has been done recently to remove part of such a strong assumption inorder to process skyline queries for real-life applications; namely; to deal with data with multi-valued attributes (known as data uncertainty); to support skyline queries in a subspacewhich is a subset of attributes selected by the user; and to support continuous queries onstreaming data.

Pulmonary emphysema classification based on an improved texton learning model by sparse representation,Min Zhang; Xiangrong Zhou; Satoshi Goshima; Huayue Chen; Chisako Muramatsu; Takeshi Hara; Ryujiro Yokoyama; Masayuki Kanematsu; Hiroshi Fujita,In this paper; we present a texture classification method based on texton learned via sparserepresentation (SR) with new feature histogram maps in the classification of emphysema.First; an overcomplete dictionary of textons is learned via KSVD learning on every classimage patches in the training dataset. In this stage; high-pass filter is introduced to excludepatches in smooth area to speed up the dictionary learning process. Second; 3D joint-SRcoefficients and intensity histograms of the test images are used for characterizing regions ofinterest (ROIs) instead of conventional feature histograms constructed from SR coefficientsof the test images over the dictionary. Classification is then performed using a classifier withdistance as a histogram dissimilarity measure.

Data management challenges and opportunities in cloud computing,Kyuseok Shim; Sang Kyun Cha; Lei Chen; Wook-Shin Han; Divesh Srivastava; Katsumi Tanaka; Hwanjo Yu; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Analyzing large data is a challenging problem today; as there is an increasing trendof applications being expected to deal with vast amounts of data that usually do not fit in themain memory of a single machine. For such data-intensive applications; database researchcommunity has started to investigate cloud computing as a cost effective option to buildscalable parallel data management systems which are capable of serving petabytes of datafor millions of users. The goal of this panel is to initiate an open discussion within thecommunity on data management challenges and opportunities in cloud computing. Potentialtopics to be discussed in the panel include: MapReduce framework; shared-nothingarchitecture; parallel query processing; security; analytical data management; transactionaldata management and fault tolerance.,Proceedings of the 17th international conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications-Volume Part II,2012,4
Structure tensor series-based matching for near-duplicate video retrieval,Xiangmin Zhou; Lei Chen; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Near duplicate video retrieval has attracted much attention due to its wide spectrumof applications including copyright detection; commercial monitoring and news videotracking. In recent years; there has been significant research effort on efficiently identifyingnear duplicates from large video collections. However; existing approaches for large videodatabases suffer from low accuracy due to the serious information loss. In this paper; wepropose a practical solution based on 3D structure tensor model for this problem. We firstpropose a novel video representation scheme; adaptive structure video tensor series (ASVTseries); together with a robust similarity measure; to improve the retrieval effectiveness.Then; we prove the effectiveness of the proposed method by extensive experiments onhundreds hours real video data.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Multimedia,2011,4
Learning-based relevance feedback for web-based relation completion,Laurianne Sitbon; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract In a pilot application based on web search engine called Web-based RelationCompletion (WebRC); we propose to join two columns of entities linked by a predefinedrelation by mining knowledge from the web through a web search engine. To achieve this; anovel retrieval task Relation Query Expansion (RelQE) is modelled: given an entity (query);the task is to retrieve documents containing entities in predefined relation to the given one.Solving this problem entails expanding the query before submitting it to a web searchengine to ensure that mostly documents containing the linked entity are returned in the top Ksearch results. In this paper; we propose a novel Learning-based Relevance Feedback(LRF) approach to solve this retrieval task. Expansion terms are learned from training pairsof entities linked by the predefined relation and applied to new entity-queries to find …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,4
Approximate entity extraction in temporal databases,Wei Lu; Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung; Xiaoyong Du; Xiaofang Zhou; Lijiang Chen; Ke Deng,Abstract We study the problem of efficiently extracting K entities; in a temporal database;which are most similar to a given search query. This problem is well studied in relationaldatabases; where each entity is represented as a single record and there exist a variety ofmethods to define the similarity between a record and the search query. However; intemporal databases; each entity is represented as a sequence of historical records. How toproperly define the similarity of each entity in the temporal database still remains an openproblem. The main challenging is that; when a user issues a search query for an entity; he orshe is prone to mix up information of the same entity at different time points. As a result;methods; which are used in relational databases based on record granularity; cannot workany further. Instead; we regard each entity as a set of “virtual records”; where attribute …,World Wide Web,2011,4
Approximate membership localization (AML) for web-based join,Zhixu Li; Laurianne Sitbon; Liwei Wang; Xiaofang Zhou; Xiaoyong Du,Abstract In this paper; we propose a search-based approach to join two tables in theabsence of clean join attributes. Non-structured documents from the web are used toexpress the correlations between a given query and a reference list. To implement thisapproach; a major challenge we meet is how to efficiently determine the number of timesand the locations of each clean reference from the reference list that is approximatelymentioned in the retrieved documents. We formalize the Approximate MembershipLocalization (AML) problem and propose an efficient partial pruning algorithm to solve it. Astudy using real-word data sets demonstrates the effectiveness of our search-basedapproach; and the efficiency of our AML algorithm.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,4
Efficient web pages identification for entity resolution,Jia Zhu; Gabriel Fung; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Entity resolution (ER) is a problem that arises in many areas. In most of cases; itrepresents a task that multiple entities from different sources require to be identified if theyrefer to the same or different objects because there are not unique identifiers associated withthem. In this paper; we propose a model using web pages identification to identify entitiesand merge those entities refer to one object together. We use a classical namedisambiguation problem as case study and examine our model on a subset of digital libraryrecords as the first stage of our work. The favorable results indicated that our proposedapproach is highly effective.,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,4

3d protein structure matching by patch signatures,Zi Huang; Xiaofang Zhou; Heng Tao Shen; Dawei Song,Abstract For determining functionality dependencies between two proteins; both representedas 3D structures; it is an essential condition that they have one or more matching structuralregions called patches. As 3D structures for proteins are large; complex and constantlyevolving; it is computationally expensive and very time-consuming to identify possiblelocations and sizes of patches for a given protein against a large protein database. In thispaper; we address a vector space based representation for protein structures; where a patchis formed by the vectors within the region. Based on our previews work; a compactrepresentation of the patch named patch signature is applied here. A similarity measure oftwo patches is then derived based on their signatures. To achieve fast patch matching inlarge protein databases; a match-and-expand strategy is proposed. Given a query patch …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2006,4

The data exchange between main memoryand secondary storage becomes a bottle-neck in terrain visualization. The slow-down of thevisualization performance is even more obvious when visualizing terrain in a client-server environmentbecause of the long response time caused by transferring large amount of data over thenetwork.

When differential privacy meets randomized perturbation: A hybrid approach for privacy-preserving recommender system,Xiao Liu; An Liu; Xiangliang Zhang; Zhixu Li; Guanfeng Liu; Lei Zhao; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Privacy risks of recommender systems have caused increasing attention. Users'private data is often collected by probably untrusted recommender system in order toprovide high-quality recommendation. Meanwhile; malicious attackers may utilizerecommendation results to make inferences about other users' private data. Existingapproaches focus either on keeping users' private data protected during recommendationcomputation or on preventing the inference of any single user's data from therecommendation result. However; none is designed for both hiding users' private data andpreventing privacy inference. To achieve this goal; we propose in this paper a hybridapproach for privacy-preserving recommender systems by combining differential privacy(DP) with randomized perturbation (RP).

The interaction between schema matching and record matching in data integration,Binbin Gu; Zhixu Li; Xiangliang Zhang; An Liu; Guanfeng Liu; Kai Zheng; Lei Zhao; Xiaofang Zhou,Schema Matching (SM) and Record Matching (RM) are two necessary steps in integratingmultiple relational tables of different schemas; where SM unifies the schemas and RMdetects records referring to the same real-world entity. The two processes have beenthoroughly studied separately; but few attention has been paid to the interaction of SM andRM. In this work; we find that; even alternating them in a simple manner; SM and RM canbenefit from each other to reach a better integration performance (ie; in terms of precisionand recall). Therefore; combining SM and RM is a promising solution for improving dataintegration. To this end; we define novel matching rules for SM and RM; respectively; that is;every SM decision is made based on intermediate RM results; and vice versa; such that SMand RM can be performed alternately.

Graph-based metric embedding for next poi recommendation,Min Xie; Hongzhi Yin; Fanjiang Xu; Hao Wang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract With the rapid prevalence of smart mobile devices and the dramatic proliferation oflocation-based social networks (LBSNs); point of interest (POI) recommendation hasbecome an important means to help people discover attractive and interesting places. In thispaper; we investigate the problem of next POI recommendation by considering thesequential influences of POIs; as a natural extension of the general POI recommendation;but it is more challenging than the general POI recommendation; due to that (1) users'preferences are dynamic; and the next POI recommendation requires tracking the change ofuser preferences in a real-time manner; and (2) the prediction space is extremely large; withmillions of distinct POIs as the next prediction target; which impedes the application ofclassical Markov chain models. In light of the above challenges; we propose a graph …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2016,3
TOSI: a trust-oriented social influence evaluation method in contextual social networks,Guanfeng Liu; Feng Zhu; Kai Zheng; An Liu; Zhixu Li; Lei Zhao; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Online Social Networks (OSNs) have been used as the means for a variety ofapplications. For example; social networking platform has been used in employment system;e-Commerce and CRM system to improve the quality of recommendations with theassistance of social networks. In these applications; social influence acts as a significantrole; affecting people's decision-making. However; the existing social influence evaluationmethods do not fully consider the social contexts; ie; the social relationships and the socialtrust between participants; and the preferences of participants; which have significant impacton social influence evaluation in OSNs. Thus; these existing methods cannot deliveraccurate social influence evaluation results.

Trip oriented search on activity trajectory,Wei Chen; Lei Zhao; Jia-Jie Xu; Guan-Feng Liu; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Driven by the flourish of location-based services; trajectory search has receivedsignificant attentions in recent years. Different from existing studies that focus on searchingtrajectories with spatio-temporal information and text de-scriptions; we study a novelproblem of searching trajectories with spatial distance; activities; and rating scores. Given aquery q with a threshold of distance; a set of activities; a start point S and a destination E; triporiented search on activity trajectory (TOSAT) returns k trajectories that can cover theactivities with the highest rating scores within the threshold of distance. In addition; weextend the query with an order; ie; order-sensitive trip oriented search on activity trajectory(OTOSAT); which takes both the order of activities in a query q and the order of trajectoriesinto consideration.

Responsibility analysis for lineages of conjunctive queries with inequalities,Biao Qin; Shan Wang; Xiaofang Zhou; Xiaoyong Du,This paper investigates the problem of efficiently computing responsibility for lineages ofconjunctive queries with inequalities on databases. We classify the lineages of a class ofqueries with inequalities; called IQ queries; into path and composite lineages. We firstcompile path lineages into lineage graphs and transform lineage graphs into matrices. Thenwe reduce the problem of computing responsibility for path lineages to the shortest pathproblem; which can be solved by the dynamic programming algorithm in PTIME. We furtherprove composite lineages can be decomposed into path lineages for computingresponsibility. Thus; our first main result shows it is in PTIME to compute responsibility forlineages of IQ queries.

Effective data density estimation in ring-based P2P networks,Minqi Zhou; Heng Tao Shen; Xiaofang Zhou; Weining Qian; Aoying Zhou,Estimating the global data distribution in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks is an important issueand has yet to be well addressed. It can benefit many P2P applications; such as loadbalancing analysis; query processing; and data mining. Inspired by the inversion method forrandom variate generation; in this paper we present a novel model named distribution-freedata density estimation for dynamic ring-based P2P networks to achieve high estimationaccuracy with low estimation cost regardless of distribution models of the underlying data. Itgenerates random samples for any arbitrary distribution by sampling the global cumulativedistribution function and is free from sampling bias. In P2P networks; the key idea fordistribution-free estimation is to sample a small subset of peers for estimating the global datadistribution over the data domain.

Continuously monitoring the correlations of massive discrete streams,Yueguo Chen; Wei Wang; Xiaoyong Du; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract The problem of monitoring the correlations of discrete streams is to continuouslymonitor the temporal correlations among massive discrete streams. A temporal correlation oftwo streams is defined as a tracking behavior; ie; the most recent pattern of one stream isvery similar to a historical pattern of another stream. The challenge is that both the trackingstream and the tracked stream are evolving; which causes the frequent updates of thecorrelation-ships. The straightforward way of monitoring correlations by brute-forcesubsequence matching will be very expensive for massive streams. We propose techniquesthat are able to significantly reduce the number of expensive subsequence matching calls;by continuously pruning and refining the correlated streams. Extensive experiments on thestreaming trajectories show the significant performance improvement achieved by the …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,3
Enhance web pages genre identification using neighboring pages,Jia Zhu; Xiaofang Zhou; Gabriel Fung,Abstract Recently web pages genre identification attracts more attentions because of itsimportance in web searching. Most of existing works used the features extracted from webpages and applied machine learning approaches like SVM as classifier to identify the genreof web pages. However; in the case where web pages do not contain enough information;such an approach may not work well. In this paper; we consider to tackle genre identificationin such situations. We propose a link-based graph model that taking into accountneighboring pages but greatly reducing the noisy information by selecting an appropriatesubset of neighboring pages. We evaluated this neighboring pages based classifier withother classifiers.

Exploring distributional discrepancy for multidimensional point set retrieval,Jie Shao; Heng Tao Shen; Zi Huang; Xiaofang Zhou,How to effectively and efficiently assess similarity is a long-standing and challengingresearch problem in various multimedia applications. For ranked retrieval in a collection ofobjects based on series of multivariate observations (eg; searching similar video clips to aquery example); satisfactory performance cannot be achieved by using many conventionalsimilarity measures that aggregate element-to-element comparison results. Somecorrelation information among the individual elements has also been investigated tocharacterize each set of multidimensional points for comparison; but with an unwarrantedassumption that the underlying data distribution has a particular parametric form. Motivatedby these concerns; measuring the similarity of multidimensional point sets is approachedfrom a novel collective perspective in this paper; by evaluating the probability that they …,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,2011,3
Efficient Common Items Extraction from Multiple Sorted Lists,Wei Lu; Chuitian Rong; Jinchuan Chen; Xiaoyong Du; Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung; Xiaofang Zhou,Given a set of lists; where items of each list are sorted by the ascending order of their values;the objective of this paper is to figure out the common items that appear in all of the listsefficiently. This problem is sometimes known as common items extraction from sorted lists.To solve this problem; one common approach is to scan all items of all lists sequentially inparallel until one of the lists is exhausted. However; we observe that if the overlap of itemsacross all lists is not high; such sequential access approach can be significantly improved. Inthis paper; we propose two algorithms; MergeSkip and MergeESkip; to solve this problem bytaking the idea of skipping as many items of lists as possible. As a result; a large number ofcomparisons among items can be saved; and hence the efficiency can be improved.

Extract interesting skyline points in high dimension,Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung; Wei Lu; Jing Yang; Xiaoyong Du; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract When the dimensionality of dataset increases slightly; the number of skyline pointsincreases dramatically as it is usually unlikely for a point to perform equally good in alldimensions. When the dimensionality is very high; almost all points are skyline points.Extract interesting skyline points in high dimensional space automatically is thereforenecessary. From our experiences; in order to decide whether a point is an interesting one ornot; we seldom base our decision on only comparing two points pairwisely (as in thesituation of skyline identification) but further study how good a point can perform in eachdimension. For example; in scholarship assignment problem; the students who are selectedfor scholarships should never be those who simply perform better than the weakest subjectsof some other students (as in the situation of skyline).

Using parallel semi-join reduction to minimize distributed query response time,Xuemin Lin; Maria E Orlowskat; Xiaofang Zhou,A one-shot semi-join reduction approach was recently proposed to execute all semi-joins onthe same relation simultaneously such that the relation only needs to be scanned once. Theone-shot semi-join reduction approach was applied to reducing distributed query responsetime under the assumption that one copy of each referenced relation has been chosen priorto the production of an execution plan. The estimations of both semi-join reduction effect andlocal join cost; employed in previous work; were restricted to a special case. In this paper;we extend the previous work in three ways:(1) remove the requirement for copy selectionbefore the production of a semi-join reduction program;(2) allow the choice of redundantcopies for the execution of semi-joins;(3) employ a general cost model which covers a largeclass of possible estimations of semi-join reduction effect and local join cost.

Efficient clue-based route search on road networks,Bolong Zheng; Han Su; Wen Hua; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou; Guohui Li,With the advances in geo-positioning technologies and location-based services; it isnowadays quite common for road networks to have textual contents on the vertices. Previouswork on identifying an optimal route that covers a sequence of query keywords has beenstudied in recent years. However; in many practical scenarios; an optimal route might notalways be desirable. For example; a personalized route query is issued by providing someclues that describe the spatial context between PoIs along the route; where the result can befar from the optimal one. Therefore; in this paper; we investigate the problem of clue-basedroute search (${\sf {CRS}} $); which allows a user to provide clues on keywords and spatialrelationships.

Ranking weighted clustering coefficient in large dynamic graphs,Xuefei Li; Lijun Chang; Kai Zheng; Zi Huang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Efficiently searching top-k representative vertices is crucial for understanding thestructure of large dynamic graphs. Recent studies show that communities formed by a vertexwith high local clustering coefficient and its neighbours can achieve enhanced informationpropagation speed as well as disease transmission speed. However; local clusteringcoefficient; which measures the cliquishness of a vertex in its local neighbourhood; prefersvertices with small degrees. To remedy this issue; in this paper we propose a new rankingmeasure; weighted clustering coefficient (WCC) of vertices; by integrating both localclustering coefficient and degree. WCC not only inherits the properties of local clusteringcoefficient but also approximately measures the density (ie; average degree) of itsneighbourhood subgraph. Thus; vertices with higher WCC are more likely to be …,World Wide Web,2017,2
An empirical study on user-topic rating based collaborative filtering methods,Tieke He; Zhenyu Chen; Jia Liu; Xiaofang Zhou; Xingzhong Du; Weiqing Wang,Abstract User based collaborative filtering (CF) has been successfully applied intorecommender system for years. The main idea of user based CF is to discover communitiesof users sharing similar interests; thus; in which; the measurement of user similarity is thefoundation of CF. However; existing user based CF methods suffer from data sparsity; whichmeans the user-item matrix is often too sparse to get ideal outcome in recommendersystems. One possible way to alleviate this problem is to bring new data sources into userbased CF. Thanks to the rapid development of social annotation systems; we turn to usingtags as new sources. In these approaches; user-topic rating based CF is proposed to extracttopics from tags using different topic model methods; based on which we compute thesimilarities between users by measuring their preferences on topics. In this paper; we …,World Wide Web,2017,2
ST-SAGE: A spatial-temporal sparse additive generative model for spatial item recommendation,Weiqing Wang; Hongzhi Yin; Ling Chen; Yizhou Sun; Shazia Sadiq; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract With the rapid development of location-based social networks (LBSNs); spatial itemrecommendation has become an important mobile application; especially when users travelaway from home. However; this type of recommendation is very challenging compared totraditional recommender systems. A user may visit only a limited number of spatial items;leading to a very sparse user-item matrix. This matrix becomes even sparser when the usertravels to a distant place; as most of the items visited by a user are usually located within ashort distance from the user's home. Moreover; user interests and behavior patterns mayvary dramatically across different time and geographical regions. In light of this; we proposeST-SAGE; a spatial-temporal sparse additive generative model for spatial itemrecommendation in this article. ST-SAGE considers both personal interests of the users …,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST),2017,2
The complexity of (list) edge-coloring reconfiguration problem,Hiroki Osawa; Akira Suzuki; Takehiro Ito; Xiao Zhou,Abstract Let G be a graph such that each edge has its list of available colors; and assumethat each list is a subset of the common set consisting of k colors. Suppose that we are giventwo list edge-colorings f_0 and f_r of G; and asked whether there exists a sequence of listedge-colorings of G between f_0 and f_r such that each list edge-coloring can be obtainedfrom the previous one by changing a color assignment of exactly one edge. This problem isknown to be PSPACE-complete for every integer k ≥ 6 and planar graphs of maximumdegree three; but any computational hardness was unknown for the non-list variant in whichevery edge has the same list of k colors. In this paper; we first improve the known result byproving that; for every integer k ≥ 4; the problem remains PSPACE-complete even forplanar graphs of maximum degree three and bounded bandwidth.

A performance study on large-scale data analytics using disk-based and in-memory database systems,Pingfu Chao; Dan He; Shazia Sadiq; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,With the significant increase in memory size; in-memory database systems are becoming thedominant way of dealing with large scale data analytics as compared to the traditional disk-based systems such as data warehouses. Due to the significant differences in both physicaland logical designs; these two systems show totally different characteristics on massive dataanalytic workload. In order to address the difference and technical reasons behind; wecontrast the performance between disk-based data warehousing and in-memory databasesystems by comparing two state-of-the-art commercial systems using a large-scale realtransportation dataset.

Using detected visual objects to index video database,Xingzhong Du; Hongzhi Yin; Zi Huang; Yi Yang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract In this paper; we focus on how to use visual objects to index the videos. Two tablesare constructed for this purpose; namely the unique object table and the occurrence table.The former table stores the unique objects which appear in the videos; while the latter tablestores the occurrence information of these unique objects in the videos. In previous works;these two tables are generated manually by a top-down process. That is; the unique objecttable is given by the experts at first; then the occurrence table is generated by the annotatorsaccording to the unique object table. Obviously; such process which heavily depends onhuman labors limits the scalability especially when the data are dynamic or large-scale. Toimprove this; we propose to perform a bottom-up process to generate these two tables. Thenovelties are: we use object detector instead of human annotation to create the …,Australasian Database Conference,2016,2
Access time oracle for planar graphs,Ke Deng; Jianxin Li; Chaoyi Pang; Jiuyong Li; Xiaofang Zhou,The study of urban networks reveals that the accessibility of important city objects for thevehicle traffic and pedestrians is significantly correlated to the popularity; micro-criminality;micro-economic vitality; and social liveability of the city; and is always the chief factor inregulating the growth and expansion of the city. The accessibility between differentcomponents of an urban structure are frequently measured along the streets and routesconsidered as edges of a planar graph; while the traffic ultimate destination points and streetjunctions are treated as vertices. For estimation of the accessibility of destination vertex $ j $from vertex $ i $ through urban networks; in particular; the random walks are used tocalculate the expected distance a random walker starting from $ i $ makes before $ j $ isvisited (known as access time).

Effect of γ-ray-radiation-modified graphene oxide on the integrated mechanical properties of PET blends,Lizhao Xie; Guowei Duan; Weikang Wang; Mozhen Wang; Qichao Wu; Xiao Zhou; Xuewu Ge,The surface modification of graphene oxide (GO) determines the interactions between GOand polymers; which possibly produces a significant impact on the mechanical properties ofpolymer. Here; GO was first modified with poly (glycidyl methacrylate)(PGMA) andtriethylenetetramine (TTA) through γ-ray radiation. Then; a tiny small amount (0.04%) of theprepared modified GO was filled with a PET/ethylene-methyl acrylate-glycidyl methacrylaterandom terpolymer (PET/ST2000) blend. The morphological analyses on these filled PETblends confirmed that the surface chemical structure of GO had a crucial impact on themechanical property of the blend. The chemical bonding between GO and ST2000 wasmore efficient in improving the dispersibility of GO and the compatibility between PET andST2000; leading to a 2.5-fold increase in the impact strength; along with a slight increase …,Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research,2016,2
Understanding Information Diffusion under Interactions.,Yuan Su; Xi Zhang; S Yu Philip; Wen Hua; Xiaofang Zhou; Binxing Fang,Abstract Information diffusion in online social networks has attracted substantial researcheffort. Although recent models begin to incorporate interactions among contagions; they stilldon't consider the comprehensive interactions involving users and contagions as a whole.Moreover; the interactions obtained in previous work are modeled as latent factors and thusare difficult to understand and interpret. In this paper; we investigate the contagion adoptionbehavior by incorporating various types of interactions into a coherent model; and propose anovel interaction-aware diffusion framework called IAD. IAD exploits the social networkstructures to distinguish user roles; and uses both structures and texts to categorizecontagions. Experiments with large-scale Weibo dataset demonstrate that IAD outperformsthe state-of-art baselines in terms of F1-score and accuracy; as well as the runtime for …,IJCAI,2016,2
Landmark-Based Route Recommendation with Crowd Intelligence,Bolong Zheng; Han Su; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Route recommendation is one of the most widely used location-based servicesnowadays; as it is vital for nice-driving experience and smooth public traffic. Given a pair ofuser-specified origin and destination; a route recommendation service aims to provide userswith the routes of the best travelling experience according to given criteria. However; eventhe routes recommended by the big-thumb service providers can deviate significantly fromthe ones travelled by experienced drivers; which motivates the previous research thatleverages crowds' knowledge to improve the recommendation quality. Since routerecommendation is normally an online task; low-latency response to drivers' queries isrequired in this kind of systems. Unfortunately; latency of crowdsourced systems is usuallyhigh; because they need to generate tasks and wait for workers' feedbacks before …,Data Science and Engineering,2016,2
Antimicrobial expanded polytetrafluoroethylene film prepared by γ-ray radiation induced grafting of poly (acrylic acid),Yun-long Wang; Mo-zhen Wang; Qi-chao Wu; Xiao Zhou; Xue-wu Ge,The simultaneous γ-ray-radiation-induced grafting polymerization of acrylic acid onexpanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) film was investigated. It was found that thedegree of grafting (DG) of poly (acrylic acid)(PAA) can be controlled by the monomerconcentration; absorbed dose; and dose rate under an optimal inhibitor concentration of[Fe2+]= 18 mmol/L. SEM observation showed that the macroporous structure in ePTFE filmswould be covered gradually with the increase of the DG of PAA. The prepared ePTFE-g-PAAfilm was immersed in a neutral silver nitrate solution to fabricate an ePTFE-g-PAA/Ag hybridfilm after the addition of NaBH4 as a reduction agent of Ag+ to Ag atom.

We prove that P^n_D is computable by a threshold circuitof size O(n\logn); which is improvement on the previous upper bound O (n). We also showthat the size of our circuit is almost optimal up to logarithmic factor: we show that anythreshold circuit computing P^n_D needs size Ω(n/\logn).,International Workshop on Algorithms and Computation,2015,2

The Fe3O4 dosage; pH; Pd loading;temperature and stirring rate were important factors for dechlorination of 2; 4-D. The removalrate of 2; 4-D increased with the increase of Fe3O4; dosage; and it reached 93.5% after 210min when the Fe3O4 dosage was 4.0 gx L (-1); while only 47.3% 2; 4-D was transformedusing bare nanoscale Pd/Fe. Low pH enhanced dechlorination and 2; 4-D was almostcompletely dechlorinated within 110 min when the pH ranged from 2.6 to 4.1. Thedechlorination efficiency was significantly influenced by Pd loading. After 210 min; thedifferent Pd loading; 0.25%; 0.50% and 0.75%; resulted in 2; 4-D reduction efficiency of51.4%; 93.5% and 99.9%; respectively.

Efficient histogram-based similarity search in ultra-high dimensional space,Jiajun Liu; Zi Huang; Heng Tao Shen; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Recent development in image content analysis has shown that the dimensionalityof an image feature can reach thousands or more for satisfactory results in someapplications such as face recognition. Although high-dimensional indexing has beenextensively studied in database literature; most existing methods are tested for featurespaces with less than hundreds of dimensions and their performance degrades quickly asdimensionality increases. Given the huge popularity of histogram features in representingimage content; in this papers we propose a novel indexing structure for efficient histogrambased similarity search in ultra-high dimensional space which is also sparse. Observing thatall possible histogram values in a domain form a finite set of discrete states; we leverage thetime and space efficiency of inverted file.

PartSS: An Efficient Partition-based Filtering for Edit Distance Constraints,Zhixu Li; Laurianne Sitbon; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract This paper introduces PartSS; a new partition-based filtering for tasks performingstring comparisons under edit distance constraints. PartSS offers improvements over thestate-of-the-art method NGPP with the implementation of a new partitioning scheme andalso improves filtering abilities by exploiting theoretical results on shifting and scalingranges; thus accelerating the rate of calculating edit distance between strings. PartSSfiltering has been implemented within two major tasks of data integration: similarity join andapproximate membership extraction under edit distance constraints. The evaluation on anextensive range of real-world datasets demonstrates major gain in efficiency over NGPP andQGrams approaches.,Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Australasian Database Conference-Volume 115,2011,2
Analysis and modeling of the indoor low voltage power-line channel noise,Xiang-yu ZHEN; Qing-qing YANG; Xiao-fang ZHOU; Jian-lin CHEN,There are many drawbacks in using the low voltage power-line distribution network ascommunication channel; and one of the most important reasons is the complicated noisescenario. The noise model based on stationary random signal theory does not includeenough instantaneous variation; but recently the cyclostationary noise models show goodresults. Considering the cyclostationary noise; this investigation carries out time-frequencyanalysis on power-line noise; and suggests a new noise model synthesized both time andfrequency characteristic. Consequently the results show that the model gives a betterdescription of power-line noise.,Journal of Circuits and Systems,2011,2

Wear resistance of compact graphite cast iron with biomimetic non-smooth surfaces processed by laser [J],Na SUN; Hong ZHOU; Hong-yu SHAN; Xiao-yan LI; Lu-quan REN,To mimic the cuticles of some typical soil animals; series biomimetic non-smooth surfacespecimens with different unit shapes; distributed spaces and slopping angles were preparedby laser processing. The wear behaviors of the specimens under dry sliding wereinvestigated. The results indicate that the biomimetic non-smooth surface specimenspossess better wear resistance than the untreated specimens. The specimen with grid non-smooth units has the best wear resistance; the specimen with stria units takes the secondand that with convex units is the worst. The wear resistance is enhanced by reducing thedistributed spaces of the non-smooth units. The wear resistance of the stria non-smoothspecimen with slopping angle of 45 is better than those with slopping angles of 0 and 90respectively. The adhesive wear is the dominative wear mechanism.,Journal of Jilin University (Engineering and Technology Edition),2009,2

With unprecedented access tomassive amount of data and powerful information gathering capabilities enabled by Web-based technologies; the traditional closed world assumption for database systems has beenchallenged. More and more data from the Web are used today as essential informationsources; directly or indirectly; for all types of decision making purposes in not only justpersonal; but also many business and scientific applications.

Localized co-occurrence model for fast approximate search in 3D structure databases,Zi Huang; Heng Tao Shen; Xiaofang Zhou,Similarity search for 3D structure data sets is fundamental to many database applicationssuch as molecular biology; image registration; and computer-aided design. Identifying thecommon 3D subtructures between two objects is an important research problem. However; itis well known that computing structural similarity is very expensive due to the highexponential time complexity of structure similarity measures. As the structure databaseskeep growing rapidly; real-time search from large-structure databases becomes problematic.In this paper; we present a novel statistical model; that is; the multiresolution Localized Co-Occurrence Model (LCM); to approximately measure the similarity between the two point-based 3D structures in linear time complexity for fast retrieval.

A scaleless data model for direct and progressive spatial query processing,Sai Sun; Sham Prasher; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract A progressive spatial query retrieves spatial data based on previous queries (eg; tofetch data in a more restricted area with higher resolution). A direct query; on the other side;is defined as an isolated window query. A multi-resolution spatial database system shouldsupport both progressive queries and traditional direct queries. It is conceptually challengingto support both types of query at the same time; as direct queries favour location-based dataclustering; whereas progressive queries require fragmented data clustered by resolutions.Two new scaleless data structures are proposed in this paper. Experimental results usingboth synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate that the query processing time based onthe new multiresolution approaches is comparable and often better than multi-representation data structures for both types of queries.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2004,2

Yet; crowd workers have wide-ranging levels of expertise. Large workerpopulations are heterogeneous and comprise a significant amount of faulty workers. As aconsequence; quality insurance for crowd answers is commonly seen as the Achilles heel ofcrowdsourcing. Although various techniques for quality control have been proposed inrecent years; a post-processing phase in which crowd answers are validated is still required.Such validation; however; is typically conducted by experts; whose availability is limited andwhose work incurs comparatively high costs. This work aims at guiding an expert in thevalidation of crowd answers. We present a probabilistic model that helps to identify the …,The VLDB Journal,2017,1

Bilinear optimized product quantization for scalable visual content analysis,Litao Yu; Zi Huang; Fumin Shen; Jingkuan Song; Heng Tao Shen; Xiaofang Zhou,Product quantization (PQ) has been recognized as a useful technique to encode visualfeature vectors into compact codes to reduce both the storage and computation cost. Recentadvances in retrieval and vision tasks indicate that high-dimensional descriptors are criticalto ensuring high accuracy on large-scale data sets. However; optimizing PQ codes with high-dimensional data is extremely time-consuming and memory-consuming. To solve thisproblem; in this paper; we present a novel PQ method based on bilinear projection; whichcan well exploit the natural data structure and reduce the computational complexity.Specifically; we learn a global bilinear projection for PQ; where we provide both non-parametric and parametric solutions. The non-parametric solution does not need any datadistribution assumption. The parametric solution can avoid the problem of local optima …,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,2017,1
Context-aware trust network extraction in large-scale trust-oriented social networks,Guanfeng Liu; Yi Liu; An Liu; Zhixu Li; Kai Zheng; Yan Wang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract In recent years; social networking sites have been used as a means for a richvariety of activities; such as movie recommendations and product recommendations. Inorder to evaluate the trust between a truster (ie; the source) and a trustee (ie; the target) whohave no direct interaction in Online Social Networks (OSNs); the trust network between themthat contains important intermediate participants; the trust relations between the participants;and the social context; has an important influence on trust evaluation. Thus; to deliver areasonable trust evaluation result; before performing any trust evaluation (ie; trusttransitivity); the contextual trust network from a given source to a given target needs to befirst extracted from the social network; where constraints on social context should also beconsidered to guarantee the quality of the extracted networks.

For two givenlist colorings of $ G $; we study the problem of transforming one into the other by changingonly one vertex color assignment at a time; while at all times maintaining a list coloring. Thisproblem is known to be PSPACE-complete even for bounded bandwidth graphs and a fixedconstant $ k $.

Mobi-SAGE: A sparse additive generative model for mobile App recommendation,Hongzhi Yin; Liang Chen; Weiqing Wang; Xingzhong Du; Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen; Xiaofang Zhou,With the rapid prevalence of smart mobile devices and the dramatic proliferation of mobileapplications (Apps); App recommendation becomes an emergent task that will benefitdifferent stockholders of mobile App ecosystems. Unlike traditional items; Apps haveprivileges to access a user's sensitive resources (eg; contacts; messages and locations)which may lead to security risk or privacy leak. Thus; users' choosing of Apps are influencedby not only their personal interests but also their privacy preferences. Moreover; user privacypreferences vary with App categories. In this paper; we propose a mobile sparse additivegenerative model (Mobi-SAGE) to recommend Apps by considering both user interests andcategory-aware user privacy preferences.

An outlier trajectory is a trajectory grossly different from others; meaningthere are few or even no trajectories following a similar route in a dataset. To identify outliertrajectories; we first present a prefix tree based algorithm called PTS; which traverses thesearch space on-the-fly to calculate the number of trajectories following similar routes foroutlier detection. Then we propose two trajectory clustering based approaches PBOTD andDBOTD to cluster trajectories and extract representative routes in different ways.

EtherQL: A Query Layer for Blockchain System,Yang Li; Kai Zheng; Ying Yan; Qi Liu; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Blockchain-the innovation behind Bitcoin-enables people to exchange digitalmoney with complete trust; and seems to be completely transforming the way we think abouttrust. While blockchain is designed for secured; immutable funds transfer in trustless anddecentralized environment; the underlying storage of blockchain is very simple with onlylimited supports for data access. Moreover; blockchain data are highly compressed beforeflushing to hard disk; making it harder to have an insight of these valuable data set.

Jointly modeling heterogeneous temporal properties in location recommendation,Saeid Hosseini; Hongzhi Yin; Meihui Zhang; Xiaofang Zhou; Shazia Sadiq,Abstract Point-Of-Interest (POI) recommendation systems suggest interesting locations tousers based on their previous check-ins via location-based social networks (LBSNs).Individuals visiting a location are partially affected by many factors including social links;travel distance and the time. A growing line of research has been devoted to takingadvantage of various effects to improve existing location recommendation methods.However; the temporal influence owns numerous dimensions which deserve to be exploredmore in depth. The subset property comprises a set of homogeneous slots such as an hourof the day; the day of the week; week of the month; month of the year; and so on. In addition;time has other attributes such as the recency which signifies the newly visited locationsversus others. In this paper; we further study the role of time factor in recommendation …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2017,1
Leveraging multi-aspect time-related influence in location recommendation,Saeid Hosseini; Hongzhi Yin; Xiaofang Zhou; Shazia Sadiq,Abstract: Point-Of-Interest (POI) recommendation aims to mine a user's visiting history andfind her/his potentially preferred places. Although location recommendation methods havebeen studied and improved pervasively; the challenges wrt employing various influencesincluding temporal aspect still remain. Inspired by the fact that time includes numerousgranular slots (eg minute; hour; day; week and etc.); in this paper; we define a new problemto perform recommendation through exploiting all diversified temporal factors. In particular;we argue that most existing methods only focus on a limited number of time-related featuresand neglect others. Furthermore; considering a specific granularity (eg time of a day) inrecommendation cannot always apply to each user or each dataset. To address thechallenges; we propose a probabilistic generative model; named after Multi-aspect Time …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1701.00595,2017,1
Exploiting Rich Contents for Personalized Video Recommendation,Xingzhong Du; Hongzhi Yin; Ling Chen; Yang Wang; Yi Yang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract: Video recommendation has become an essential way of helping people explorethe video world and discover the ones that may be of interest to them. However; mainstreamcollaborative filtering techniques usually suffer from limited performance due to the sparsityof user-video interactions; and hence are ineffective for new video recommendation.Although some recent recommender models such as CTR and CDL; have integrated textinformation to boost performance; user-generated videos typically include scarce or low-quality text information; which seriously degenerates performance. In this paper; weinvestigate how to leverage the non-textual content contained in videos to improve thequality of recommendations. We propose to first extract and encode the diverse audio; visualand action information that rich video content provides; then effectively incorporate these …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1612.06935,2016,1
Finding least on-road travel time on road network,Lei Li; Xiaofang Zhou; Kevin Zheng,Abstract Shortest path and fastest path query on time-dependent road network are widelyused nowadays; but none of them can answer a least on-road travel time query; which aimsto find a path between two vertices on a time-dependent road network that has the minimumon-road travel time (waiting on any vertex is allowed). In this paper; we propose a cheapestpath algorithm which expands Dijkstra's Algorithm to solve this problem. The time complexityof it is O (| V|\log| V|+| V| T+| E| T^ 2); where T is the number of the involving time unit;| V| isthe number of vertices and| E| is the number of edges. Extensive experiments are conductedon the two different speed profiles to test the performance of our cheapest path algorithm.The results validate the effectiveness of our work.,Australasian Database Conference,2016,1
Exploiting Hierarchies for Efficient Detection of Completeness in Stream Data,Simon Razniewski; Shazia Sadiq; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract In big data settings; the data can often be externally sourced with little or noknowledge of its quality. In such settings; users need to be empowered with the capacity tounderstand the quality of data sets and implications for use; in order to mitigate the risk ofmaking investments in datasets that will not deliver. In this paper we present an approach fordetecting the completeness of high volume stream data generated by a large number of dataproviders. By exploiting the inherent hierarchies within database attributes; we are able todevise an efficient solution for computing query specific completeness; thereby improvinguser understanding of implications of using query results based on incomplete data.,Australasian Database Conference,2016,1
When Peculiarity Makes a Difference: Object Characterisation in Heterogeneous Information Networks,Wei Chen; Feida Zhu; Lei Zhao; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract A central task in heterogeneous information networks (HIN) is how to characterisean entity; which underlies a wide range of applications such as similarity search; entityprofiling and linkage. Most existing work focus on using the main features common to all.While this approach makes sense in settings where commonality is of primary interest; thereare many scenarios as important where uncommon and discriminative features are moreuseful. To address the problem; a novel model COHIN (Characterize Objects inHeterogeneous Information Networks) is proposed; where each object is characterized as aset of feature paths that contain both main and discriminative features. In addition; wedevelop an effective pruning strategy to achieve greater query performance. Extensiveexperiments on real datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can achieve high …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2016,1
Ward@ trecvid 2016,Xingzhong Du; Yi Yang; Xiaofang Zhou,In this year's competition [1]; we made three changes based on last year's system [2]. Thefirst change was using original videos instead of resized videos. The second change wastraining the code books under separated cameras. The final change was performing innervector normalization after feature encoding. In the cross validation; some of the proposedchanges had impact on the detection and together made the fusion more accurate.However; in the competition; this year's submission was inferior to the last year's submission.We investigated the submission and found that it was caused by using the original videos;which was proposed for the intention of increasing the motion saliency in the features. As aconsequence; we will not use the original videos to extract features for the next round.,Proceedings of TRECVID,2016,1
Quality-Aware Entity-Level Semantic Representations for Short Texts.,Wen Hua; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Recent prevalence of Web search engines; microblogging services as well asinstant messaging tools give rise to a large amount of short texts including queries; tweetsand instant messages. A better understanding of the semantics embedded in short texts isindispensable for various Web applications. We adopt the entity-level semanticrepresentation which interpretes a short text as a sequence of mentionenity pairs. A typicalstrategy consists of two steps: entity extraction to locate entity mentions; and entity linking toidentify their corresponding entities. However; it is never a trivial task to achieve high quality(ie; complete and accurate) interpretations for short texts. First; short texts are noisy;containing massive abbreviations; nicknames and misspellings. As a result; traditional entityextraction methods cannot detect every potential entity mentions. Second; entities are …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2016,1
Geographical constraint and temporal similarity modeling for point-of-interest recommendation,Huimin Wu; Jie Shao; Hongzhi Yin; Heng Tao Shen; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract People often share their visited Points-of-Interest (PoIs) by “check-ins”. On the onehand; human mobility varies with each individual but still implies regularity. Check-ins of anindividual tend to localize in a specific geographical range. We propose a novel model tocapture personalized geographical constraint of each individual. On the other hand; PoIsreflect requirements of people from different aspects. Usually; places of different functionsshow different temporal visiting distributions and places of similar function share similarvisiting pattern in temporal aspect. Temporal distribution similarity can be used tocharacterize functional similarity. Based on the findings above; this paper introducesimproved collaborative filtering models by jointly taking advantages of geographicalconstraint and temporal similarity.

A novel digital certificate based remote data access control scheme in WSN,Wei Liang; Zhiqiang Ruan; Hongbo Zhou; Yong Xie,A digital certificate based remote data access control scheme is proposed for safeauthentication of accessor in wireless sensor network (WSN). The scheme is founded on theaccess control scheme on the basis of characteristic expression (named CEB scheme). Datais divided by characteristics and the key for encryption is related to characteristic expression.Only the key matching with characteristic expression can decrypt the data. Meanwhile; threedistributed certificate detection methods are designed to prevent the certificate from beingmisappropriated by hostile anonymous users. When a user starts query; the key accesscontrol method can judge whether the query is valid. In this case; the scheme can achievepublic certificate of users and effectively protect query privacy as well.

Multilevel Thresholding Approach Using Modified Bacterial Foraging Optimization.,Kezong Tang; Zuoyong Li; Jun Wu; Tong Zhang,Abstract—In this work; a multilevel thresholding approach that uses modified bacterialforaging optimization (MBFO) is presented for enhancing the applicability and practicality ofoptimal thresholding techniques. First; the diversity of solutions is considered during thereproduction step. Each weak bacterium randomly selects a strong bacterium from thehealthiest bacteria; attempts to reach a location near the chosen strong bacterium; andmaintains the same direction. Particle swarm optimization is subsequently incorporated intoeach chemotactic step to strengthen the global searching capability and quicken theconvergence rate of the bacterial foraging algorithm. Finally; the optimal thresholds areobtained by maximizing the Tsallis thresholding functions using the proposed MBFOalgorithm.

Efficient Aggregate Farthest Neighbour Query Processing on Road Networks,Haozhou Wang; Kai Zheng; Han Su; Jiping Wang; Shazia Sadiq; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract This paper addresses the problem of searching the k aggregate farthest neighbours(A k FN query in short) on road networks. Given a query point set; A k FN is aimed at findingthe top-k points from a dataset with the largest aggregate network distance. The challenge ofthe A k FN query on the road network is how to reduce the number of network distanceevaluation which is an expensive operation. In our work; we propose a three-phase solution;including clustering points in dataset; network distance bound pre-computing and searching.By organizing the objects into compact clusters and pre-calculating the network distancebound from clusters to a set of reference points; we can effectively prune a large fraction ofclusters without probing each individual point inside. Finally; we demonstrate the efficiencyof our proposed approaches by extensive experiments on a real Point-of-Interest (POI) …,Australasian Database Conference,2014,1
Orange: Objective-aware range query refinement,Abdullah Albarrak; Tatiana Noboa; Hina A Khan; Mohamed A Sharaf; Xiaofang Zhou; Shazia Sadiq,In this demo paper we present Orange; a system prototype for objective-aware range queryrefinement. Orange essentially refines a range query to meet a pre-specified cardinalityconstraint while taking into account the (dis) similarity between the initial query and itscorresponding refined version. To achieve this goal; Orange employes the novel schemeSAQR for efficient similarity-aware query refinement. The main idea underlying SAQR is toutilize the pre-defined constraints on cardinality and similarity in order to bound the searchspace and quickly find a refined query; which meets the user's expectations. We showcaseOrange in a web-based application which aims to guide planners in allocating service zonesfor police patrol units using real and historical dataset of crime incidents.,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2014 IEEE 15th International Conference on,2014,1

Exploiting structural similarity for automatic information extraction from lists,Dat T Huynh; Jiajie Xu; Shazia Sadiq; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract In this paper; we propose a novel technique to reduce dependency on knowledgebase for ONDUX; the current state-of-art method for information extraction by textsegmentation. While the existing approach mainly relies on high overlapping between pre-existing data and input lists to build an extraction model; our approach exploits structuralsimilarity of text segments in the sequences of a list to align them into groups to achieveeffectiveness with low dependency on pre-existing data. Firstly; a structural similaritymeasure between text segments is proposed and combined with content similarity to assesshow likely two text segments in a list should be aligned in the same group. Then we devise adata shifting-alignment technique in which positional information and the similarity scoresare employed to cluster text segments into groups before their labels are revised by an …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2013,1

Substituted Pyridines As Sodium Channel Blockers,Benjamin Blass,Summary: Voltage-gated sodium channels are found in both the peripheral and the centralnervous system and are the primary mechanism for generation of the rapid upstroke portionof the action potential of excitable cells. Proper function of these channels is critical tonormal neuronal function; while aberrant channel function is associated with severalmedical conditions; including pain. It has been suggested that Nav1. 7; a tetrodotoxin-sensitive channel that is preferentially expressed in peripheral sympathetic and sensoryneurons; plays a key role in acute; inflammatory; and neuropathic pain. In addition; it hasbeen demonstrated that a number of local anesthetics; such as lidocaine and bupivacaine;exert their biological effects by interfering with sodium ion influx; further suggesting a linkbetween pain sensation and sodium channels.

Storage and use of provenance information for relational database queries,Zhifeng Bao; Henning Koehler; Xiaofang Zhou; Tok Wang Ling,Abstract In database querying; provenance information can help users understand wheredata comes from and how it is derived. Storing the provenance data is critical in the sensethat; the storage cost should be as small as possible and of fine granularity; and it shouldsupport the user query on provenance tracking efficiently as well. In this demo; we haveimplemented a relational database system prototype which can support SQL-like querywhile supporting provenance data recording during query execution. In particular; wepropose a tree structure to store provenance information and further propose variousreduction strategies to optimize its storage cost; we support the functionality of provenancedata tracking at tuple level for user queries in a visualized way.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2011,1
Minimum Cost Edge-Colorings of Trees Can Be Reduced to Matchings,Takehiro Ito; Naoki Sakamoto; Xiao Zhou; Takao Nishizeki,Let C be a set of colors; and let ω (c) be an integer cost assigned to a color c in C. An edge-coloring of a graph G is to color all the edges of G so that any two adjacent edges arecolored with different colors in C. The cost ω (f) of an edge-coloring f of G is the sum of costsω (f (e)) of colors f (e) assigned to all edges e in G. An edge-coloring f of G is optimal if ω (f)is minimum among all edge-colorings of G. In this paper; we show that the problem of findingan optimal edge-coloring of a tree T can be simply reduced in polynomial time to theminimum weight perfect matching problem for a new bipartite graph constructed from T. Thereduction immediately yields an efficient simple algorithm to find an optimal edge-coloring ofT in time O (n 1.5 Δlog (nN ω)); where n is the number of vertices in T; Δ is the maximumdegree of T; and N ω is the maximum absolute cost| ω (c)| of colors c in C.

Active duplicate detection,Ke Deng; Liwei Wang; Xiaofang Zhou; Shazia Sadiq; Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung,Abstract The aim of duplicate detection is to group records in a relation which refer to thesame entity in the real world such as a person or business. Most existing works require userspecified parameters such as similarity threshold in order to conduct duplicate detection.These methods are called user-first in this paper. However; in many scenarios; pre-specification from the user is very hard and often unreliable; thus limiting applicability of user-first methods. In this paper; we propose a user-last method; called Active DuplicateDetection (ADD); where an initial solution is returned without forcing user to specify suchparameters and then user is involved to refine the initial solution. Different from user-firstmethods where user makes decision before any processing; ADD allows user to makedecision based on an initial solution.

While the issue of data quality is as old as data itself; it is now exposed at a muchmore strategic level; eg through business intelligence (BI) systems; increasing manifold thestakes involved. Corporations routinely operate and make strategic decisions based onremarkably inaccurate or incomplete data. This proves a leading reason for failure of high-profile and high-cost IT projects such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP); CustomerRelationship Management (CRM); Supply Chain Management (SCM) and others. Accordingto an industry survey [1]; the presence of data quality (DQ) problems costs US businessmore than 600 billion dollars per annum.,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2008,1
A multiresolution terrain model for efficient visualization query processing,Kai Xu; Xiaofang Zhou; Xuemin Lin; Heng Tao Shen; Ke Deng,Multiresolution triangular mesh (MTM) models are widely used to improve the performanceof large terrain visualization by replacing the original model with a simplified one. MTMmodels; which consist of both original and simplified data; are commonly stored in spatialdatabase systems due to their size. The relatively slow access speed of disks makes dataretrieval the bottleneck of such terrain visualization systems. Existing spatial access methodsproposed to address this problem rely on main-memory MTM models; which leads tosignificant overhead during query processing. In this paper; we approach the problem from anew perspective and propose a novel MTM called direct mesh that is designed specificallyfor secondary storage.

Multiresolution query optimization in an online environment,Kai Xu; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Multiresolution (or multi-scale) techniques make it possible for Web-based GISapplications to access large dataset. The performance of such systems relies on datatransmission over network and multiresolution query processing. In the literature the latterhas received little research attention so far; and the existing methods are not capable ofprocessing large dataset. In this paper; we aim to improve multiresolution query processingin an online environment. A cost model for such query is proposed first; followed by threestrategies for its optimization.

Spatial query processing using generalized filter,Xiaofang Zhou; Xuemin Lin; Chengfei Liu; Jinli Cao,Spatial data; ranging from various land information data to different types of environmentaldata; are typically collected and used by different custodians. The full benefits of usingspatial data can be achieved by combining the data from different sources covering acommon region. Due to organizational; political and technical reasons; it is unrealistic tophysically integrate the vast amount of spatial data managed by different systems in differentorganizations. A practical approach is to provide interoperability to support multi-site dataqueries. In this paper; we study the performance aspect of complex spatial query processing.We propose a framework for processing queries with multiple spatial and aspatial predicatesusing data from multiple sites. Using a new concept called generalized filter; a query isprocessed in three steps. First; an aspatial filter that incorporates some conditions derived …,International Journal of Cooperative Information Systems,2000,1
Parallel transitive closure computation in relational databases,Xiaofang Zhou; Yanchun Zhang; Maria E Orlowska,Abstract The transitive closure operation is an important extension to relational algebra.Because of its high computation cost; it is of great interest to design efficient parallelalgorithms for computing the transitive closure in relational database systems. In this paper;we present a new algorithm to compute transitive closures on SIMD meshes based onrelational algebra operations. Double-hash distribution is used to avoid rehashing newtuples for the next join phase. There presently exists no extra step for the redistribution ofthese tuples. Possible redundant computation between different join phases has beenprevented without using global operations. As only regular linear communication occurs onthe mesh; and the workload is fully distributed; a speedup of O (n× n) has been achieved;where n× n is the size of mesh. Therefore; this algorithm is an optimal parallel version of …,Information sciences,1996,1
The Correlation Between the Transverse Polarization andTransverse Momentum of Lambda Produced in RelativisticNucleus-Nucleus Collisions [J],Ye Yunxiu; Su Shufangl; Zhou Xin; Zhu Guohuai; Ji Gang,The transverse polarization of lambda produced in relativistic nucleus-nucleuscollisions isdetermined. The effect from the interaction between spin moment andmagnetic field iscorrected. The near zero transverse polarization and non-correlationbetween transversepolarization and transverse momentum are obtained and comparedto pos obtained from thenucleus-nucleus interactions at lower energies.

Theaction points result from an analysis of the landscape of data quality research. Thelandscape exhibits two dimensions of empiricism in data quality research relating to type ofmetrics and scope of method. Our study indicates the presence of a data continuum rangingfrom real to synthetic data; which has implications for how data quality methods areevaluated.

A Privacy-Preserving Framework for Trust-Oriented Point-of-Interest Recommendation,An Liu; Weiqi Wang; Zhixu Li; Guanfeng Liu; Qing Li; Xiaofang Zhou; Xiangliang Zhang,Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation has attracted many interests recently because of itssignificant potential for helping users to explore new places and helping location-basedservice (LBS) providers to carry out precision marketing. Compared with the user-item ratingmatrix in conventional recommender systems; the user-location check-in matrix in POIrecommendation is usually much more sparse; which makes the notorious cold startproblem more prominent in POI recommendation. Trust-oriented recommendation is aneffective way to deal with this problem but it requires that the recommender has access touser check-in and trust data. In practice; however; these data are usually owned by differentbusinesses who are not willing to share their data with the recommender mainly due toprivacy and legal concerns.

Computing Crowd Consensus with Partial Agreement,Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung; Huynh Huu Viet; Nguyen Thanh Tam; Matthias Weidlich; Hongzhi Yin; Xiaofang Zhou,Crowdsourcing has been widely established as a means to enable human computation atlarge-scale; in particular for tasks that require manual labelling of large sets of data items.Answers obtained from heterogeneous crowd workers are aggregated to obtain a robustresult. However; existing methods for answer aggregation are designed for discrete tasks;where answers are given as a single label per item. In this paper; we consider partial-agreement tasks that are common in many applications such as image tagging anddocument annotation; where items are assigned sets of labels. Common approaches for theaggregation of partial-agreement answers either (i) reduce the problem to several instancesof an aggregation problem for discrete tasks or (ii) consider each label independently.

The Coloring Reconfiguration Problem on Specific Graph Classes,Tatsuhiko Hatanaka; Takehiro Ito; Xiao Zhou,Abstract We study the problem of transforming one (vertex) k-coloring of a graph into anotherone by changing only one vertex color assignment at a time; while at all times maintainingak-coloring; where k denotes the number of colors. This decision problem is known to bePSPACE-complete even for bipartite graphs and any fixed constant k ≥ 4 k≥ 4. In thispaper; we study the problem from the viewpoint of graph classes. We first show that theproblem remains PSPACE-complete for chordal graphs even if the number of colors is afixed constant. We then demonstrate that; even when the number of colors is a part of input;the problem is solvable in polynomial time for several graph classes; such as split graphsand trivially perfect graphs.,International Conference on Combinatorial Optimization and Applications,2017,*
Diagnosing and Minimizing Semantic Drift in Iterative Bootstrapping Extraction,Zhixu Li; Ying He; Binbin Gu; An Liu; Xiaofang Zhou,Semantic drift is a common problem in iterative information extraction. Previous approachesfor minimizing semantic drift may incur substantial loss in recall. We observe that mostsemantic drifts are introduced by a small number of questionable extractions in the earlierrounds of iterations. These extractions subsequently introduce a large number ofquestionable results; which lead to the semantic drift phenomenon. We call thesequestionable extractions Drifting Points (DPs). If erroneous extractions are the" symptoms" ofsemantic drift; then DPs are the" causes" of semantic drift. In this paper; we propose amethod to minimize semantic drift by identifying the DPs and removing the effect introducedby the DPs. We use isA (concept-instance) extraction as an example to describe ourapproach in cleaning information extraction errors caused by semantic drift; but we …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,*

Exploiting Spatio-Temporal User Behaviors for User Linkage,Wei Chen; Hongzhi Yin; Weiqing Wang; Lei Zhao; Wen Hua; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Cross-device and cross-domain user linkage have been attracting a lot of attentionrecently. An important branch of the study is to achieve user linkage with spatio-temporaldata generated by the ubiquitous GPS-enabled devices. The main task in this problem istwofold; ie; how to extract the representative features of a user; how to measure thesimilarities between users with the extracted features. To tackle the problem; we propose anovel model STUL (Spatio-Temporal User Linkage) that consists of the following twocomponents. 1) Extract users-spatial features with a density based clustering method; andextract the users-temporal features with the Gaussian Mixture Model.

Exploiting detected visual objects for frame-level video filtering,Xingzhong Du; Hongzhi Yin; Zi Huang; Yi Yang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Videos are generated at an unprecedented speed on the web. To improve theefficiency of access; developing new ways to filter the videos becomes a popular researchtopic. One on-going direction is using visual objects to perform frame-level video filtering.Under this direction; existing works create the unique object table and the occurrence tableto maintain the connections between videos and objects. However; the creation process isnot scalable and dynamic because it heavily depends on human labeling. To improve this;we propose to use detected visual objects to create these two tables for frame-level videofiltering. Our study begins with investigating the existing object detection techniques. Afterthat; we find object detection lacks the identification and connection abilities to accomplishthe creation process alone.

Although existing approaches are generallysuccessful; we observe a unique characteristic in certain time series data; ie; significantperiodicity and strong randomness; which leads to poor compression performance usingexisting methods and hence calls for a specifically designed compression mechanism thatcan utilise the periodic and stochastic patterns at the same time.

Minimal on-road time route scheduling on time-dependent graphs,Lei Li; Wen Hua; Xingzhong Du; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract On time-dependent graphs; fastest path query is an important problem and hasbeen well studied. It focuses on minimizing the total travel time (waiting time+ on-road time)but does not allow waiting on any intermediate vertex if the FIFO property is applied.However; in practice; waiting on a vertex can reduce the time spent on the road (forexample; resuming traveling after a traffic jam). In this paper; we study how to find a pathwith the minimal on-road time on time-dependent graphs by allowing waiting on somepredefined parking vertices. The existing works are based on the following fact: the arrivaltime of a vertex v is determined by the arrival time of its in-neighbor u; which does not hold inour scenario since we also consider the waiting time on u if u allows waiting. Thus;determining the waiting time on each parking vertex to achieve the minimal on-road time …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,*

Existing spatial keywordquery methodologies mainly focus on the spatial and textual similarities; while leaving thesemantic understanding of keywords in spatial Web objects and queries to be ignored.

What-if Analysis with Conflicting Goals: Recommending Data Ranges for Exploration,Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung; Nguyen Thanh Tam; Matthias Weidlich; Duong Chi Thang; Xiaofang Zhou,ABSTRACT What-if analysis is a data-intensive exploration to inspect how changes in a setof input parameters of a model influence some outcomes. It is motivated by a user trying tounderstand the sensitivity of the model to a certain parameter in order to reach a set of goalsthat are defined over the outcomes. However; conducting what-if analysis manually is labour-intensive as it requires exploration of all possible combinations of parameter values. Efficientwhat-if exploration therefore calls for a partitioning of possible parameter values into dataranges and a unified representation of the obtained outcomes per range. Traditionaltechniques to capture data ranges; such as histograms; are limited to one outcomedimension. Yet; in practice; what-if analysis often involves conflicting goals that are definedover different dimensions of the outcome.

Synthesis and morphology control of raspberry-like poly (ethylene terephthalate)/polyacrylonitrile microspheres,Yong-Fei Xu; Mo-Zhen Wang; Qi-Chao Wu; Xiao Zhou; Xue-Wu Ge,Abstract The fabrication of raspberry-like poly (ethylene terephthalate)/polyacrylonitrile(PET/PAN) microspheres by γ-ray radiation-induced polymerization of acrylonitrile on micron-sized PET microspheres were first reported in this work. A PET emulsion was firstly preparedby dispersing a PET solution with 1; 1; 2; 2-tetrachloroethane/phenol mixture as the solventinto an aqueous solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Then; PET microspheres were formedby precipitating the PET emulsion droplets from ethanol. The influence of the PET solventand the weight ratio of ethanol to PET emulsion on the morphology of the PET microsphereshad been investigated. After the surface of the prepared PET microspheres was grafted withpoly (acrylic acid); the grafting polymerization of AN also had been successfully initiated by γ-ray radiation to form PAN microspheres with a size of about 100 nm on the PET …,Chinese Chemical Letters,2016,*
Algorithm for Generalized Coloring Reconfiguration Problem,Hiroki Osawa; Akira Suzuki; Takehiro Ito; Xiao Zhou,Abstract: For an integer k≥ 1; k-coloring reconfiguration is one of the most well-studiedreconfiguraiton problems; defined as follows: In the problem; we are given two (vertex-)colorings of a graph using k colors; and asked to transform one into the other by recoloringonly one vertex at a time; while at all times maintaining a proper coloring. The problem isknown to be PSPACE-complete if k≥ 4; and solvable for any graph in polynomial time if k≤3. In this paper; we introduce a recolorability constraint on the k colors; which forbids somepairs of colors to be recolored directly each other. The recolorability constraint is given interms of an undirected graph R such that each node in R corresponds to a color and eachedge in R represents a pair of colors that can be recolored directly. Then; we show that thisproblem is solvable for any graph if R is of maximum degree at most two.,*,2016,*

Cost Edge-Coloring of a Cactus,Zhiqian Ye; Yiming Li; Huiqiang Lu; Xiao Zhou,Abstract Let C be a set of colors; and let c () ω be an integer cost assigned to a color c in C.An edge-coloring of a graph G VE (;)= is assigning a color in C to each edge e E∈ so thatany two edges having end-vertex in common have different colors. The cost f () ω of an edge-coloring f of G is the sum of costs fe (()) ω of colors fe () assigned to all edges e in G. An edge-coloring f of G is optimal if f () ω is minimum among all edge-colorings of G. A cactus is aconnected graph in which every block is either an edge or a cycle. In this paper; we give analgorithm to find an optimal edgecoloring of a cactus in polynomial time. In our bestknowledge; this is the first polynomial-time algorithm to find an optimal edge-coloring of acactus.,World Journal of Engineering and Technology,2015,*

Predicting Users’ Purchasing Behaviors Using Their Browsing History,Tieke He; Hongzhi Yin; Zhenyu Chen; Xiaofang Zhou; Bin Luo,Abstract Some E-commerce giants (eg; Amazon and Jingdong) with abundant purchasingdata achieve highly accurate recommendations; since people have to pay for their choicesand their purchasing behaviors are more qualified and valid for capturing users' needs andpreferences than other types of users' behavior data (eg; browsing). However; there is notenough users' purchasing data available for most of small and medium-size E-commercesites as well as some newly established E-commerce sites. In this paper; we aim to alleviatethe sparsity of users' purchasing data by exploiting users' browsing data which is moresufficient. The low validity and reliability of users' browsing data raises great challenge foraccurately predicting users' purchasing behaviors since there are many factors leading tousers' browsing behaviors.

The Minimum Vulnerability Problem on Graphs,Takehiro Ito; Christian Konrad; Xiao Zhou,Abstract. Suppose that each edge e of an undirected graph G is associated with threenonnegative integers cost (e); vul (e) and cap (e); called the cost; vulnerability and capacityof e; respectively. Then; we consider the problem of finding k paths in G between twoprescribed vertices with the minimum total cost; each edge e can be shared without cost byat most vul (e) paths; and can be shared by more than vul (e) paths if we pay cost (e); butcannot be shared by more than cap (e) paths even if we pay the cost of e. This problemgeneralizes the disjoint path problem; the minimum shared edges problem and the minimumedge cost flow problem for undirected graphs; and it is known to be NP-hard. In this paper;we study the problem from the viewpoint of specific graph classes; and give three results.We first show that the problem remains NP-hard even for bipartite series-parallel graphs …,Combinatorial Optimization and Applications: 8th International Conference; COCOA 2014; Wailea; Maui; HI; USA; December 19-21; 2014; Proceedings,2014,*

An evolution-based robust social influence evaluation method in Online Social Networks,Feng Zhu; Guanfeng Liu; An Liu; Lei Zhao; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Online Social Networks (OSNs) are becoming popular and attracting lots ofparticipants. In OSN based e-commerce platforms; a buyer's review of a product is one of themost important factors for other buyers' decision makings. A buyer who provides high qualityreviews thus has strong social influence; and can impact a large number of participants'purchase behaviours in OSNs. However; the dishonest participants can cheat the existingsocial influence evaluation models by using some typical attacks; like Constant andCamouflage; to obtain fake strong social influence. Therefore; it is significant to accuratelyevaluate such social influence to recommend the participants who have strong socialinfluences and provide high quality product reviews.

EISA: An Efficient Information Theoretical Approach to Value Segmentation in Large Databases,Weiqing Wang; Shazia Sadiq; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Value disparity is a widely known problem; that contributes to poor data qualityresults and raises many issues in data integration tasks. Value disparity; also known ascolumn heterogeneity; occurs when the same entity is represented by disparate values;often within the same column in a database table. A first step in overcoming value disparityis to identify the distinct segments. This is a highly challenging task due to high number offeatures that define a particular segment as well as the need to undertake valuecomparisons which can be exponential in large databases. In this paper; we propose anefficient information theoretical approach to value segmentation; namely EISA. EISA not onlyreduces the number of the relevant features but also compresses the size of the values to besegmented. We have applied our method on three datasets with varying sizes.

FFT design for OFDM-based cognitive radio using a reconfigurable baseband processing architecture,Wenqing Lu; Gerald E Sobelman; Xiaofang Zhou; Junyan Ren,Cognitive Radio (CR) has been proposed to address the apparent paradox betweenspectrum scarcity and spectrum underutilization. It requires the use of a reconfigurablearchitecture to support a wide range of operating modes. In the case of OFDM-based CR;several subcarriers could interfere with licensed (ie; the primary) users; so there may be alarge number of zero-valued input/output points of the IFFT/FFT and the standard FFTalgorithms are not efficient in such a situation. In this paper; we discuss how a moreappropriate FFT algorithm; transform decomposition; can be mapped onto a reconfigurablebaseband processing architecture.

Formally; P^n_LR:{0;1\}^n*{0;1\}^n→{0;1\} is defined as follows: For every x=(x1; x 2;…; xn)∈ 0; 1 n and y=(y 1; y 2;…; yn)∈ 0; 1 n; P^n_LR(x;y)=1 if there exists a pair ofindices i and j such that i< j and xi= yj= 1; and P^n_LR(x;y)=0 otherwise. We prove thatP^n_LR can be computed by a threshold circuit of energy e and size s=O\left(e⋅n^2/(e-1)\right) for any integer e; 3≤ e≤ 2 log 2 n+ 1. Our result implies that one can construct anenergy-efficient circuit computing P^n_LR if it is allowable to use large size. Moreover; wefocus on an extreme case where a threshold circuit has energy e= 1; and show that P^n_LRcan be computed by a threshold circuit of energy e= 1 and size s=\left⌈n/2\right⌉; while P …,International Conference on Theory and Applications of Models of Computation,2013,*

The importance of dataprovenance has already been widely recognized in database community. The two majorapproaches to representing provenance information use annotations and inversion. Whileannotation is metadata pre-computed to include the derivation history of a data product; theinversion method finds the source data based on the situation that some derivation processcan be inverted. Annotations are flexible to represent diverse provenance metadata but thecomplete provenance data may outsize data itself. Inversion method is concise by using asingle inverse query or function but the provenance needs to be computed on-the-fly.

Given anintermediate image produced by certain demosaicing and super-resolution; a residualimage between a final reconstruction image and the intermediate image is reconstructedusing sparse representation. Richer edges and details are found in the final reconstructionimage. Specifically; a generic dictionary is learned from a large set of composite trainingdata composed of intermediate data and residual data. The learned dictionary implies amapping between the two data. A specific dictionary adaptive to the input CFA is learnedthereafter.

Studies on the anomalous IR properties of CoPt nanorods,Rong-hua ZHANG; Yan-xia JIANG,One-dimensional CoPt nanorods were obtained through the galvanic displacement reactionand chemical reduction. The average diameter of the nanorods was measured to be about166.3 nm and the length was mostly between 1.0 and 5.0 μm obtained from the scanningelectron microscopy (SEM) measurement. The IR optical properties of the CoPt nanorodsand bulk Pt were investigated by in situ FTIR reflection spectroscopy employing COadsorption as probe reaction at the solid/gas interface. The results of in situ FTIR indicatedthat bulk Pt shows a normal IR optical property and the CoPt nanorods display abnormalinfrared effects (AIREs). The authors can obtain the same results whether the CoPt nanorodswere loaded on glassy carbon (GC) or Au substrates. These results demonstrated that theAIREs were generated mainly by CoPt nanorods and the influence of the substrate …,Spectroscopy and Spectral Analysis,2011,*
XML query processing using views,Caiyun Yao; Jiaheng Lu; Wei Wang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract A fundamental problem in XML query processing is tree pattern query (TPQ)matching which computes all data instances in an XML database that match an input TPQ.More recently; there is growing attention on applying materialized views; which is anestablished and effective optimization technique in relational database systems; to TPQmatching. We study the query answering using views problem for tree pattern queries (QAV).The QAV problem is traditionally formulated in two ways:(i) find a maximal result; or (ii) findan equivalent result. For the former; there exists an idea of searching for a maximalcontained rewriting; by applying some compensation to the result of view. Because not allthe answers will be returned; some useful answers may be missing. Motivated by this; westudy the latter one—finding an equivalent rewriting of tree pattern queries.

Study of pitch shifting technology and the sound quality evaluating,XR Zhang; Lan Tian,Three pitch shifting methods were studied and implemented; which were the improvedsynchronized overlap-add fixed synthesis (SOLA-FS) method; interpolation-on-frequencymethod; and the phase vocoder method. The improved SOLA-FS method was especiallydiscussed in detail. Principles and characteristics were analyzed and simulation resultswere provided. In the experiments; it was found that the three methods could all achieve theeffects of pitch-shifting; that is the pitch of the audio would be changed but the durationwould be kept unchanged. But the auditory perceptions of the three methods were different.So; a sound quality evaluation test was carried out. The results of auditory evaluation testsshowed that; under the given pitch-shifting ratio; whether for up or down; the sound qualityprocessed by the improved SOLA-FS method is the best.,Shandong Daxue Xuebao(GongxueBan),2011,*

Providing flexible tradeoff for provenance tracking,Liwei Wang; Henning Köehler; Ke Deng; Xiaofang Zhou; Shazia Sadiq,Abstract The description of the origins of a piece of data and the transformations by which itarrived in a database is called data provenance; lineage or pedigree. The two majorapproaches to represent provenance information use annotations and inversion.Annotations are flexible in representing diverse provenance metadata but the completeprovenance data may outsize the data itself. The inversion method is concise by using asingle inverse query or function but the provenance needs to be computed on-the-fly whichcan be expensive. This paper proposes a new approach of provenance storage whichcombines the two methods and is adaptive to storage constraint.,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2010,*

Rebuilding the world from views,Xiaofang Zhou; Henning Köhler,Abstract With the ever-increasing growth of the internet; more and more data sets are beingmade available. Most of this data has its origin in the real world; often describing the sameobjects or events from different viewpoints. One can thus consider data sets obtained fromdifferent sources as different (and possibly inconsistent) views of our world; and it makessense to try to integrate them in some form; eg to answer questions which involve data frommultiple sources. While data integration is an old and well-investigated subject; the nature ofthe data sets to be integrated is changing. They increase in volume as well as complexity;are often undocumented; relationships between data sets are more fuzzy; andrepresentations of the same real-word object differ.

Transitivity-preserving skylines for partially ordered domains,Henning Köhler; Kai Zheng; Jing Yang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract The skyline of a set P of multi-dimensional points (tuples) consists of those points inP for which no clearly better point in P exists; using component-wise comparison ondomains of interest. The guiding idea is to prune large data sets to a more manageable size;while ensuring that points of interest are preserved. However; when domains are onlypartially ordered; it easily happens that the skyline is nearly as large as the original set (or atleast of the same order of magnitude); since most of the time points are incomparable in atleast some dimension.

Available online,Monica Berrondo; Jeffrey J Gray; Robert Schleif,Abstract An algorithm implemented in Rosetta correctly predicts the folding capabilities ofthe 17-residue N-terminal arm of the AraC gene regulatory protein when arabinose is boundto the protein and the dramatically different structure of this arm when arabinose is absent.The transcriptional activity of 43 mutant AraC proteins with alterations in the arm sequenceswas measured in vivo and compared with their predicted folding properties. Seventeen ofthe mutants possessed regulatory properties that could be directly compared with foldingpredictions. Sixteen of the 17 mutants were correctly predicted. The algorithm predicts thatthe N-terminal arm sequences of AraC homologs fold to the Escherichia coli AraC armstructure. In contrast; it predicts that random sequences of the same length and manypartially randomized E. coli arm sequences do not fold to the E. coli arm structure. The …,*,2010,*

To implement this approach; amajor challenge we meet is how to efficiently determine the number of times and thelocations of each clean reference from the reference list that is approximately mentioned inthe retrieved documents. We formalize the Approximate Membership Localization (AML)problem and propose an efficient partial pruning algorithm to solve it.

A-027 Convex Drawings of Internally Triconnected Plane Graphs on O (n^ 2) Grids,Xiao Zhou; Takao Nishizeki,抄録 In a convex grid drawing of a plane graph; every edge is drawn as a straight-linesegment without any edge-intersection; every vertex is located at a grid point; and everyfacial cycle is drawn as a convex polygon. A plane graph G has a convex drawing if and onlyif G is internally triconnected. It has been known that an internally triconnected plane graphG of n vertices has a convex grid drawing on a grid of O (n^ 3) area if the triconnectedcomponent decomposition tree of G has at most four leaves. In this paper; we improve thearea bound O (n^ 3) to O (n^ 2); which is optimal within a coefficient. More precisely; weshow that G has a convex grid drawing on a 2n× 4n grid.

Implement TSK Model Using a Self-constructing Fuzzy Neural Network,Yao Yuan; Zhang Kailong; Zhou Xinshe,This paper proposes an approach to implement TSK model by using a self-constructingfuzzy neural network (SCFNN). This network is built based on ellipsoidal basis function(EBF); which can be divided into two parts. The first hidden layer composed of EBF units isconsidered as IF-part; and the output layer which consists of the connect weights is theTHEN-part. The structure of SCFNN can adjust adaptively by a new structure learningalgorithm based on the proposed crucial factor which denotes the importance of a fuzzy rule.Thus; a rule can be generated or pruned automatically according to both the firing strengthof the rule and the performance of SCFNN. Simulation results show that the SCFNN has thepowerful capability to extract fuzzy rules in the network.

A Line Selection Method Based on Capacitor Switching by Complex Wavelet,Dengdeng Zhou; Zhigang Liu; Weili Bai; Jian Xie; Hua Yang,When the single-phase to ground fault occurs; the initial current traveling wave of fault lineand normal lines will change steeply; if the capacitor of bus isn't considered. When thecapacitor of bus switches; the initial current traveling wave of normal line will change slightly;but that has no effect on the fault line which still keeps abruptly change. Based on that; thispaper proposes a new line selection method to identify the fault line by using the capacitorswitching strategy when the fault occurs. Though complex transform; many disadvantages ofreal wavelet transform can be avoided. This method can enlarge the differences betweennormal line and fault line; and reinforce the detection accuracy in a great extent.

Dual dimensionality reduction for efficient video similarity search,Zi Huang; Heng Tao Shen; Xiaofang Zhou; Jie Shao,Abstract With ever more advanced development in video devices and their extensiveusages; searching videos of user interests from large scale repositories; such as web videodatabases; is gaining its importance. However; the huge complexity of video data; caused byhigh dimensionality of frames (or feature dimensionality) and large number of frames (orsequence dimensionality); prevents existing content-based search engines from using largevideo databases. Hence; dimensionality reduction on the data turns out to be mostpromising. In this paper; we propose a novel video reduction method called Optimal DualDimensionality Reduction (ODDR) to dramatically reduce the video data complexity foraccurate and quick search; by reducing the dimensionality of both feature vector andsequence. For a video sequence; ODDR first maps each high dimensional frame into a …,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2007,*

In this paper; we present our approach to use the shape feature forimage retrieval. First; we introduce an effective image decomposition method calledCrawling Window (CW) to distinguish the outline of each object in the image.

Both of them are of Type c; and use no ASR/MToutput information: run id I c 2 UQ1 1 uses 64-dimensional visual features and run id I c 2UQ2 2 uses 32-dimensional visual features for retrieval. Based on the evaluation results withthe benchmark video data; we observed that there is no significant difference between thesetwo runs in terms of what measured. Meanwhile; utilizing visual information only seems noteasy to capture the high-level semantic similarity required by the search topics of this year;so more sophisticated approaches such as multi-modality fusion are needed to improve thesystem performance.,TRECVID,2007,*

Partitioning a multi-weighted graph to connected subgraphs of almost uniform size,Takehiro Ito; Kazuya Goto; Xiao Zhou; Takao Nishizeki,Abstract Assume that each vertex of a graph G is assigned a constant number q ofnonnegative integer weights; and that q pairs of nonnegative integers li and ui; 1≤ i≤ q; aregiven. One wishes to partition G into connected components by deleting edges from G sothat the total i-th weights of all vertices in each component is at least li and at most ui foreach index i; 1≤ i≤ q. The problem of finding such a “uniform” partition is NP-hard for series-parallel graphs; and is strongly NP-hard for general graphs even for q= 1. In this paper weshow that the problem and many variants can be solved in pseudo-polynomial time forseries-parallel graphs. Our algorithms for series-parallel graphs can be extended for partialk-trees; that is; graphs with bounded tree-width.,International Computing and Combinatorics Conference,2006,*

They were resistant to powdery mildew both at Zhoushan of ZhejiangProvince and Fujian Putian of Fujian Province. Statistical analysis showed that two-rowed;barley had stronger resistance then multi-rowed barley. Powdery mildew on resistantvarieties occured later than on susceptible varieties. The resistant materials most came fromforeign countries including England; German; Sweden; Syria; Australia and Mexico.,Journal of Plant Protection,1997,*
Determination of thyroid volume (weight) by scintigraphy compared with ultrasound,Xinjian Zhou; Shizhen Liu; Qian Zhou,PURPOSE: To observe the correlation between thyroid weights determined by scintigraphyand ultrasound. METHODS: Thyroid volume (weight) was determined by nuclear medicinescintigraphy and ultrasound in 363 hyperthyroidism patients before 131 I therapy. Amongthem; 65 cases of diffuse goitre with thyrotoxicosis were studied again both by scintigraphyand ultrasound 6 months after therapy. RESULTS: A good correlation was observedbetween thyroid weights determined by scintigraphy and ultrasound (r= 0.93; P< 0.01). Theaverage value determined by scintigraphy was more than that by ultrasound. The maininfluencing factor was thyroid thickness. CONCLUSION: When thyroid weights were in fittingrange; scintigraphy or ultrasound can be used either. After 131 I therapy; the results ofultrasound were more accurate. The scintigraphy could be selected when thyroid had …,Chinese Journal of Nuclear Medicine,1997,*

Because an automatic regulating system of cooling rate at theplugging orifices is adopted; lower plugging temperatures can be measured precisely. In thecourse of measuring temperatures and flows; an isolated measurement pod data detectionand controlling system is used; thus the interferences are eliminated and the pluggingtemperatures can be obtained more accurately. The plugging meter is controlled by acomputer and tested on multipurpose sodium purification loop. This instrument is calibratedagainst the temperatures of the cold trap. The results indicate that the plugging temperatureare very near to the lowest temperature of the cold trap,Atomic Energy Science and Technology,1994,*

Surface Crystallization Phenomena in MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 Glass,Xuelu ZHOU; Masayuki YAMANE,抄録 The surface crystallization of glass with a composition MgO (16.7); Al 2 O 3 (22.3); SiO2 (61)(wt%) was investigated; using XRD; DTA and SEM. Aggregated particles of β-quartzprecipitated from fire-polished surface of the glass. The aggregation of non-crystallinespherical particles of about 500-1000Å was observed in the region cotiguous to the surfacelayer containing β-quartz. However; the number of spherical particles decreased with depthfrom the crystallized surface by the logarithmic function; with substantially the same particlesize regardless of the depth. The precipitation of β-quartz; petallite and α-cordierite wasobserved for the sample with mechanically polished surface. The surface crystallization inthis case developed into the glass with the dendrite structure.

Argument Discovery via Crowdsourcing,Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung; Duong Chi Thang; Nguyen Thanh Tam; Matthias Weidlich; Karl Aberer; Hongzhi Yin; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract The amount of controversial issues being discussed on the Web has been growingdramatically. In articles; blogs; and wikis; people express their points of view in the form ofarguments; ie; claims that are supported by evidence. Discovery of arguments has a largepotential for informing decision-making. However; argument discovery is hindered by thesheer amount of available Web data and its unstructured; free-text representation. Theformer calls for automatic text-mining approaches; whereas the latter implies a need formanual processing to extract the structure of arguments. In this paper; we propose acrowdsourcing-based approach to build a corpus of arguments; an argumentation base;thereby mediating the trade-off of automatic text-mining and manual processing in argumentdiscovery. We develop an end-to-end process that minimizes the crowd cost while …,*,*,*

Store and Use Provenance Information For Relational Query,Zhifeng Bao; Henning Koehler; Xiaofang Zhou; Tok Wang Ling,Abstract. In database querying; provenance information can help users understand wheredata comes from and how it is derived. Storing the provenance data is critical in the sensethat; the storage cost should be as small as possible and of fine granularity; and it shouldsupport the user query on provenance tracking efficiently as well. In this demo; we haveimplemented a relational database system prototype which can support SQL-like querywhile supporting provenance data recording during query execution. In particular; wepropose a tree structure to store provenance information and further propose variousreduction strategies to optimize its storage cost; we support the functionality of provenancedata tracking at tuple level for user queries in a visualized way.,*,*,*
with Minimum Bends,Xiao Zhou; Takao Nishizeki,Abstract. In an orthogonal drawing of a. planar graph G; each vertex is drawn as a point;each edge is drawn as a sequence of alternate horizontal and vertical line segments; andany two edges do not cross except at their common end. A bend is a point where an edgechanges its direction. A drawing of G is called an optimal orthogonal drawing if the numberof bends is minimum among all orthogonal drawings of G'. In this pa-per we give analgorithm to ﬁnd an optimal orthogonal drawing of any given series-parallel graph of themaximum degree at most three. Our algorithm takes linear time; while the previously knownbest algorithm takes cubic time. Furthermore; our algorithm is much simpler than theprevious one. We also obtain a best possible upper bound on the number of bends in anoptimal drawing.,*,*,*

Direct Mesh: Visualization for Multiresolution Terrain Database,Kai Xu; Xiaofang Zhou; Ke Deng; Heng Tao Shen; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Multiresolution Triangular Mesh (MTM) models are widely used in terrainvisualization to cope with the increasing data size. MTM model; which consists of bothoriginal and simplified data; it commonly stored in spatial database system due to its largesize. Slow disk access speed makes retrieval performance of such database the bottleneckof many terrain visualization systems. Existing approaches rely on spatial access methods toimprove retrieval efficiency. However; they are all built upon MTM models that are designedfor main memory; which are not well suited for secondary-storage retrieval. In this paper wepropose a novel MTM called direct mesh designed specifically for secondary storage andsupports available indexing methods natively.

Dynamic High Dimensional Data Mapping for Efficient Similarity Query Processing,Xiangmin Zhou; Guoren Wang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract For efficient processing of similarity queries; the search space is often reduced bypruning inactive query subspaces which do not contain any query results so only thoseactive query subspaces which may contain query results are examined. Among the activequery subspaces; however; not all of them contain query results; an active query subspacethat later turns out to contain no query results are called false active query subspaces. Theperformance of similarity query processing degrades in the presence of false active querysubspaces. This problem becomes more serious for high dimensional data with non-uniformdistribution. Our experiments show that the number of accesses to false active subspacesincreases when the number of dimensions increases. To overcome this problem; wepropose; in this paper; a space mapping approach that can reduce such unnecessary …,*,*,*

Comparison of wavelet and cosine basis for representation of arbitrarily shaped image segments,Liu Ying; Surendra Ranganath; Xiaofang Zhou,ABSTRACT The efficient representation of arbitrarily shaped image segments is animportant issue in objectbased image coding. This paper describes an algorithm by whichthe given image segment is successively approximated using 2-D shapeindependent basisfunctions defined on a rectangle circumscribing the image segment. Discrete cosine anddiscrete wavelet basis were used in the system respectively; and performance comparisonbetween them was made. Simulation results show that wavelet basis usually yields betterapproximations than the discrete cosine basis. However; using wavelet basis; theextrapolation outside the image segment is not smooth; due to the selection of basisfunctions with small overlap with the image segment. To solve this problem; we proposed anew basis selection method which gives priority to basis functions that have larger …,*,*,*
