Comparative analysis of five XML query languages,Angela Bonifati; Stefano Ceri,Abstract XML is becoming the most relevant new standard for data representation andexchange on the WWW. Novel languages for extracting and restructuring the XML contenthave been proposed; some in the tradition of database query languages (ie SQL; OQL);others more closely inspired by XML. No standard for XML query language has yet beendecided; but the discussion is ongoing within the World Wide Web Consortium and withinmany academic institutions and Internet-related major companies. We present a comparisonof five; representative query languages for XML; highlighting their common features anddifferences.,ACM Sigmod Record,2000,353
On evaluating schema matching and mapping,Zohra Bellahsene; Angela Bonifati; Fabien Duchateau; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract The increasing demand of matching and mapping tasks in modern integrationscenarios has led to a plethora of tools for facilitating these tasks. While the plethora madethese tools available to a broader audience; it led to some form of confusion regarding theexact nature; goals; core functionalities; expected features; and basic capabilities of thesetools. Above all; it made performance measurements of these systems and their distinction adifficult task. The need for design and development of comparison standards that will allowthe evaluation of these tools is becoming apparent. These standards are particularlyimportant to mapping and matching system users; since they allow them to evaluate therelative merits of the systems and take the right business decisions. They are also importantto mapping system developers; since they offer a way of comparing the system against …,*,2011,335
Designing data marts for data warehouses,Angela Bonifati; Fabiano Cattaneo; Stefano Ceri; Alfonso Fuggetta; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract Data warehouses are databases devoted to analytical processing. They are used tosupport decision-making activities in most modern business settings; when complex datasets have to be studied and analyzed. The technology for analytical processing assumesthat data are presented in the form of simple data marts; consisting of a well-identifiedcollection of facts and data analysis dimensions (star schema). Despite the wide diffusion ofdata warehouse technology and concepts; we still miss methods that help and guide thedesigner in identifying and extracting such data marts out of an enterprisewide informationsystem; covering the upstream; requirement-driven stages of the design process. Manyexisting methods and tools support the activities related to the efficient implementation ofdata marts on top of specialized technology (such as the ROLAP or MOLAP data servers) …,ACM transactions on software engineering and methodology,2001,268
Dynamic XML documents with distribution and replication,Serge Abiteboul; Angela Bonifati; Grégory Cobéna; Ioana Manolescu; Tova Milo,Abstract The advent of XML as a universal exchange format; and of Web services as a basisfor distributed computing; has fostered the apparition of a new class of documents: dynamicXML documents. These are XML documents where some data is given explicitly while otherparts are given only intensionally by means of embedded calls to web services that can becalled to generate the required information. By the sole presence of Web services; dynamicdocuments already include inherently some form of distributed computation. A higher levelof distribution that also allows (fragments of) dynamic documents to be distributed and/orreplicated over several sites is highly desirable in today's Web architecture; and in fact isalso relevant for regular (non dynamic) documents. The goal of this paper is to study newissues raised by the distribution and replication of dynamic XML data.

Active rules for XML: A new paradigm for E-services,Angela Bonifati; Stefano Ceri; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract. XML is rapidly becoming one of the most widely adopted technologies forinformation exchange and representation. As the use of XML becomes more widespread;we foresee the development of active XML rules; ie; rules explicitly designed for themanagement of XML information. In particular; we argue that active rules for XML offer anatural paradigm for the rapid development of innovative e-services. In the paper; we showhow active rules can be specified in the context of XSLT; a pattern-based language forpublishing XML documents (promoted by the W3C) which is receiving strong commercialsupport; and Lorel; a query language for XML documents that is quite popular in theresearch world. We demonstrate; through simple examples of active rules for XSLT andLorel; that active rules can be effective for the implementation of e-commerce services …,The VLDB Journal,2001,116
XPath lookup queries in P2P networks,Angela Bonifati; Ugo Matrangolo; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Mayank Jain,Abstract We address the problem of querying XML data over a P2P network. In P2Pnetworks; the allowed kinds of queries are usually exact-match queries over file names. Wediscuss the extensions needed to deal with XML data and XPath queries. A single peer canhold a whole document or a partial/complete fragment of the latter. Each XMLfragment/document is identified by a distinct path expression; which is encoded in adistributed hash table. Our framework differs from content-based routing mechanisms;biased towards finding the most relevant peers holding the data. We perform fragmentsplacement and enable fragments lookup by solely exploiting few path expressions stored oneach peer. By taking advantage of quasi-zero replication of global catalogs; our systemsupports fast full and partial XPath querying. To this purpose; we have extended the …,Proceedings of the 6th annual ACM international workshop on Web information and data management,2004,99
Active xquery,Angela Bonifati; Stefano Paraboschi,Summary We analyze some of the issues arising when an event-condition-action (ECA) rulemechanism is introduced within an XML management system. Apart from the presentation ofa specific solution; the focus of the chapter is on two aspects. First; we analyze the couplingmodes (immediate and deferred) that can be adopted to integrate the event application partand the rule evaluation part. Then; we illustrate how the component responsible of updatingXML data and the rule processing engine can be integrated in a loose or tight way;producing two distinct rule execution semantics.,*,2004,97
HePToX: marrying XML and heterogeneity in your P2P databases,Angela Bonifati; Elaine Qing Chang; Aks VS Lakshmanan; Terence Ho; Rachel Pottinger,Abstract We present HePToX; a full-fledged peer-to-peer database system that efficientlyhandles XML data heterogeneity. In a highly dynamic P2P network; it is unrealistic for a peerentering the network to be forced to agree on a global mediated schema; or to performheavy-weight operations for mapping its schema to neighboring schemas. In our demo; weshow that to enter the HePToX network a peer user is only asked to draw a simple set ofvisual annotations to a few other schemas. We show how the mapping rules are thenautomatically generated and how efficient query translation is performed on top of thesemappings.,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,92
Pushing reactive services to XML repositories using active rules,Angela Bonifati; Stefano Ceri; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract Push technology; ie; the ability of sending relevant information to clients in reactionto new events; is a fundamental aspect of modern information systems; XML is rapidlyemerging as the widely adopted standard for information exchange and representation andhence; several XML-based protocols have been defined and are the object of investigationat W3C and throughout commercial organizations. In this paper; we propose the newconcept of active XML rules for “pushing” reactive services to XML-enabled repositories.Rules operate on XML documents and deliver information to interested remote users inreaction to update events occurring at the repository site. The proposed mechanismassumes the availability of XML repositories supporting a standard XML query language;such as XQuery that is being developed by the W3C; for the implementation of the …,Computer Networks,2002,89
Schema mapping verification: the spicy way,Angela Bonifati; Giansalvatore Mecca; Alessandro Pappalardo; Salvatore Raunich; Gianvito Summa,Abstract Schema mapping algorithms rely on value correspondences-ie; correspondencesamong semantically related attributes-to produce complex transformations among datasources. These correspondences are either manually specified or suggested by separatemodules called schema matchers. The quality of mappings produced by a mappinggeneration tool strongly depends on the quality of the input correspondences. In this paper;we introduce the Spicy system; a novel approach to the problem of verifying the quality ofmappings. Spicy is based on a three-layer architecture; in which a schema matching moduleis used to provide input to a mapping generation module. Then; a third module; the mappingverification module; is used to check candidate mappings and choose the ones thatrepresent better transformations of the source into the target. At the core of the system …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,86
Warehousing workflow data: Challenges and opportunities,Angela Bonifati; Fabio Casati; Umeshwar Dayal; Ming-Chien Shan,Abstract Workflow management systems (WfMSs) are software platforms that allow thedefinition; execution; monitoring; and management of business processes. WfMSs log everyevent that occurs during process execution. Therefore; workflow logs include a significantamount of information that can be used to analyze process executions; understand thecauses of high-and low-quality process executions; and rate the performance of internalresources and business partners. In this paper we present a packaged data warehousingsolution; coupled with HP Process Manager; for collecting and analyzing workflow executiondata. We first present the main challenges involved in this effort; and then detail theproposed approach.,VLDB,2001,72
-XQueC: Pushing Queries to Compressed XML Data,Andrei Arion; Sandra D'Aguanno; Ioana Manolescu; Angela Bonifati; Gianni Costa; Andrea Pugliese,This chapter reveals that the loader and compressor convert XML documents in acompressed; yet queryable format. The compressed repository stores the compresseddocuments and provides: access methods to this compressed data; and a set ofcompression-specific utilities that enable; eg; the comparison of two compressed values.The query processor optimizes and evaluates XQuery queries over the compresseddocuments. Its complete set of physical operators allows for efficient evaluation over thecompressed repository. The chapter motivates the choice of the storage structures forcompressed XML; and of the compression algorithms employed.

XQueC: A query-conscious compressed XML database,Andrei Arion; Angela Bonifati; Ioana Manolescu; Andrea Pugliese,Abstract XML compression has gained prominence recently because it counters thedisadvantage of the verbose representation XML gives to data. In many applications; suchas data exchange and data archiving; entirely compressing and decompressing a documentis acceptable. In other applications; where queries must be run over compresseddocuments; compression may not be beneficial since the performance penalty in running thequery processor over compressed data outweighs the data compression benefits. Whilebalancing the interests of compression and query processing has received significantattention in the domain of relational databases; these results do not immediately translate toXML data. In this article; we address the problem of embedding compression into XMLdatabases without degrading query performance. Since the setting is rather different from …,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT),2007,64
Distributed databases and peer-to-peer databases: past and present,Angela Bonifati; Panos K Chrysanthis; Aris M Ouksel; Kai-Uwe Sattler,Abstract The need for large-scale data sharing between autonomous and possiblyheterogeneous decentralized systems on the Web gave rise to the concept of P2P databasesystems. Decentralized databases are; however; not new. Whereas a definition for a P2Pdatabase system can be readily provided; a comparison with the more establisheddecentralized models; commonly referred to as distributed; federated and multi-databases;is more likely to provide a better insight to this new P2P data management technology. Thus;in the paper; by distinguishing between db-centric and P2P-centric features; we examinefeatures common to these database systems as well as other ad-hoc features that solelycharacterize P2P databases. We also provide a non-exhaustive taxonomy of the mostprominent research efforts toward the realization of full-fledged P2P databases.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2008,58
Efficient query evaluation over compressed XML data,Andrei Arion; Angela Bonifati; Gianni Costa; Sandra d’Aguanno; Ioana Manolescu; Andrea Pugliese,Abstract XML suffers from the major limitation of high redundancy. Even if compression canbe beneficial for XML data; however; once compressed; the data can be seldom browsedand queried in an efficient way. To address this problem; we propose XQueC; an [XQue] ryprocessor and [C] ompressor; which covers a large set of XQuery queries in the compresseddomain. We shred compressed XML into suitable data structures; aiming at both reducingmemory usage at query time and querying data while compressed. XQueC is the first systemto take advantage of a query workload to choose the compression algorithms; and to groupthe compressed data granules according to their common properties. By means ofexperiments; we show that good trade-offs between compression ratio and query capabilitycan be achieved in several real cases; as those covered by an XML benchmark.

Schema mapping and query translation in heterogeneous P2P XML databases,Angela Bonifati; Elaine Chang; Terence Ho; Laks V Lakshmanan; Rachel Pottinger; Yongik Chung,Abstract Peers in a peer-to-peer data management system often have heterogeneousschemas and no mediated global schema. To translate queries across peers; we assumeeach peer provides correspondences between its schema and a small number of other peerschemas. We focus on query reformulation in the presence of heterogeneous XML schemas;including data---metadata conflicts. We develop an algorithm for inferring precise mappingrules from informal schema correspondences. We define the semantics of query answeringin this setting and develop query translation algorithm. Our translation handles anexpressive fragment of XQuery and works both along and against the direction of mappingrules. We describe the HePToX heterogeneous P2P XML data management system whichincorporates our results. We report the results of extensive experiments on HePToX on …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2010,49
Method of identifying and analyzing business processes from workflow audit logs,*,A method of identifying and analyzing business processes includes the step of populating adata warehouse database with data from a plurality of sources including an audit log. Theaudit log stores information from a plurality of instantiations of a defined process. The data isthen analyzed to predict an outcome of a subsequent instance of the process. Data miningtechniques such as pattern recognition are applied to the data warehouse data to identifyspecific patterns of execution. Once the patterns have been identified; the outcome of asubsequent instance of the process can be predicted at nodes other than just the start node.The probability of completion information can be used to modify resource assignments;execution paths; process definitions; activity priority; or resource assignment criteria insubsequent invocations of the defined process.,*,2002,46
Path summaries and path partitioning in modern XML databases,Andrei Arion; Angela Bonifati; Ioana Manolescu; Andrea Pugliese,Abstract XML path summaries are compact structures representing all the simple parent-child paths of an XML document. Such paths have also been used in many works as a basisfor partitioning the document's content in a persistent store; under the form of path indices orpath tables. We revisit the notions of path summaries and path-driven storage model in thecontext of current-day XML databases. This context is characterized by complex queries;typically expressed in an XQuery subset; and by the presence of efficient encodingtechniques such as structural node identifiers. We review a path summary's many uses forquery optimization; and given them a common basis; namely relevant paths. We discusssummary-based tree pattern minimization and present some efficient summary-basedminimization heuristics. We consider relevant path computation and provide a time-and …,World Wide Web,2008,44
Building multi-device; content-centric applications using WebML and the W3I3 Tool Suite,Angela Bonifati; Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali; Andrea Maurino,Abstract In the forthcoming years; two factors will jeopardize the deployment of Webapplications: supporting multi-device outputs and one-to-one personalization. These twofactors will lead to an explosion of solutions; to be developed; maintained; and keptconsistent; meanwhile; Web hosting companies will be subject to growing service demandsand will be lacking the technical man-power required to master them. With these premises;the strength of the W3I31 tool suite is to propose a model-driven approach to Web sitedesign. Such an approach is based on WebML; a high-level language for specifying thestructure of the content of aWeb application and the organization and presentation of such acontent in a Web site. In this paper; after a brief presentation of WebML; we concentrate onthe W3I3 tool architecture; shown at work on case-study based on the popular site http …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2000,43
Efficient fragmentation of large XML documents,Angela Bonifati; Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Abstract Fragmentation techniques for XML data are gaining momentum within bothdistributed and centralized XML query engines and pose novel and unrecognizedchallenges to the community. Albeit not novel; and clearly inspired by the classical divide etimpera principle; fragmentation for XML trees has been proved successful in boosting thequerying performance; and in cutting down the memory requirements. However;fragmentation considered so far has been driven by semantics; ie built around querypredicates. In this paper; we propose a novel fragmentation technique that founds onstructural constraints of XML documents (size; tree-width; and tree-depth) and on special-purpose structure histograms able to meaningfully summarize XML documents. This allowsus to predict bounding intervals of structural properties of output (XML) fragments for …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2007,42
Storing and retrieving XPath fragments in structured P2P networks,Angela Bonifati; Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Abstract In this paper; we address the problem of storing and retrieving XML data overstructured Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. These are becoming popular because of theiraccess efficiency. An open problem with such networks is represented by the kinds ofqueries they can handle. In fact; file name lookups; used in popular unstructured networks;are not suitable for many new data formats. Keyword-based searches are also notappropriate for XML data; which must be identified by the whole path leading to an element;rather than by the sole element name. We discuss the extensions needed to properly identifyXML data in structured P2P networks. A global document is split into various fragments;which are locally stored within the peers according to their own themes. Each fragment isenhanced with a set of few lightweight path expressions that have the convenient side …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2006,39

As XML is emerging asthe data format of the Internet era; there is a substantial increase of the amount of dataencoded in XML format. To better describe such XML data structures and constraints;several XML schema languages have been proposed by academic institutions; Internet-related major companies and the World Wide Web Consortium. Similarly; to better query andupdate such XML data; novel query languages for extracting; transforming and integratingthe XML content have been de ned; some in the tradition of database query languages (ieSQL; OQL; Datalog); others more closely inspired by XML; and others with a reasonablymixed avor.

Active behaviors within XML document management,Angela Bonifati,Abstract XML is rapidly emerging as the most widely adopted technology for informationrepresentation and exchange on the WWW [27]. Novel languages [2; 17; 9; 24; 28] forextracting and restructuring the XML content have been proposed; some in the tradition ofdatabase query languages; others more closely inspired by XML [21]. The discussions onstandardization within the World Wide Web Consortium proceed very fast and a standardquery language will be soon chosen and made available [1]. Sophisticated query engines;that allow user to deal with semi-structured data; will be crucial to exploiting the full power ofXML. On the other side; traditional query engines are being used in practice for processingXML documents conforming to DTDs: translators of XML queries to SQL queries over tablesare likely to be eective in most cases. Under this scenario; it looks clear that existing …,*,2000,32
Adding Updates to XQuery: Semantics; Optimization; and Static Analysis.,Michael Benedikt; Angela Bonifati; Sergio Flesca; Avinash Vyas,The need to extend XQuery to support updates has been recognized both in the researchand the standards community. Several language proposals and prototype implementationshave been put forward; and update language requirements are being defined within theW3C. Most proposals center around the use of update primitives applied to XQueryexpressions; along with a variant of the FLWR loop construct binding variables within ablock of basic update statements. In defining a precise semantics for such statements anumber of issues arise: one must decide how conflicts among updates are to be resolved;and how query evaluation interacts with update application. In this work we provide aframework for defining alternative semantics for updates; and identify within this space whatis (thus far) the consensus choice: that semantics involves a twostage execution process …,XIME-P,2005,31
Verification of tree updates for optimization,Michael Benedikt; Angela Bonifati; Sergio Flesca; Avinash Vyas,Abstract With the rise of XML as a standard format for representing tree-shaped data; newprogramming tools have emerged for specifying transformations to tree-like structures. Arecent example along this line are the update languages of [16; 15; 8] which add tree updateprimitives on top of the declarative query languages XPath and XQuery. These tree updatelanguages use a “snapshot semantics”; in which all querying is performed first; after which agenerated sequence of concrete updates is performed in a fixed order determined by queryevaluation. In order to gain efficiency; one would prefer to perform updates as soon as theyare generated; before further querying. This motivates a specific verification problem: givena tree update program; determine whether generated updates can be performed before allquerying is completed. We formalize this notion; which we call “Binding Independence” …,International Conference on Computer Aided Verification,2005,30
gMark: schema-driven generation of graphs and queries,Guillaume Bagan; Angela Bonifati; Radu Ciucanu; George HL Fletcher; Aurélien Lemay; Nicky Advokaat,Massive graph data sets are pervasive in contemporary application domains. Hence; graphdatabase systems are becoming increasingly important. In the experimental study of thesesystems; it is vital that the research community has shared solutions for the generation ofdatabase instances and query workloads having predictable and controllable properties. Inthis paper; we present the design and engineering principles of gMark; a domainand querylanguage-independent graph instance and query workload generator. A core contribution ofgMark is its ability to target and control the diversity of properties of both the generatedinstances and the generated workloads coupled to these instances. Further noveltiesinclude support for regular path queries; a fundamental graph query paradigm; and schema-driven selectivity estimation of queries; a key feature in controlling workload chokepoints …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2017,25
Learning path queries on graph databases,Angela Bonifati; Radu Ciucanu; Aurélien Lemay,We investigate the problem of learning graph queries by exploiting user examples. The inputconsists of a graph database in which the user has labeled a few nodes as positive ornegative examples; depending on whether or not she would like the nodes as part of thequery result. Our goal is to handle such examples to find a query whose output is what theuser expects. This kind of scenario is pivotal in several application settings where unfamiliarusers need to be assisted to specify their queries. In this paper; we focus on path queriesdefined by regular expressions; we identify fundamental difficulties of our problem setting;we formalize what it means to be learnable; and we prove that the class of queries understudy enjoys this property. We additionally investigate an interactive scenario where we startwith an empty set of examples and we identify the informative nodes ie; those that …,18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology (EDBT),2015,22
Algebraic incremental maintenance of XML views,Angela Bonifati; Martin Goodfellow; Ioana Manolescu; Domenica Sileo,Abstract Materialized views can bring important performance benefits when querying XMLdocuments. In the presence of XML document changes; materialized views need to beupdated to faithfully reflect the changed document. In this work; we present an algebraicapproach for propagating source updates to XML materialized views expressed in apowerful XML tree pattern formalism. Our approach differs from the state-of-the-art in thearea in two important ways. First; it relies on set-oriented; algebraic operations; to becontrasted with node-based previous approaches. Second; it exploits state-of-the-artfeatures of XML stores and XML query evaluation engines; notably XML structural identifiersand associated structural join algorithms. We present algorithms for determining howupdates should be propagated to views; and highlight the benefits of our approach over …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2013,21
Managing distributed workspaces with active XML,Serge Abiteboul; Jérôme Baumgarten; Angela Bonifati; Gregory Cobena; Cosmin Cremarenco; Florin Dragan; Ioana Manolescu; Tova Milo; Nicoleta Preda,1 Introduction The tremendous evolution of the Web has brought the need for platformsallowing to easily deploy distributed data management applications. The current trend goestowards the de-centralization of such platforms; and in particular to peer-to-peerarchitectures. In this spirit; the Active XML system [1; 2; 3; 7](AXML; for short) provides a peer-to-peer data integration platform; based on Web standards such as XML; and Web services[8]. The system is centered around AXML documents: XML documents where parts of thecontent is explicit XML data; whereas other parts are dynamically generated by calls to Webservices on the same or on other peers. By including Web service calls; AXML documentsalready have an inherent form of distributed computation. A higher level of distribution thatalso allows (fragments of) AXML documents and (some of the) Web services that they use …,Proceedings of the 29th international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 29,2003,21
Interactive inference of join queries,Angela Bonifati; Radu Ciucanu; Slawomir Staworko,We investigate the problem of inferring join queries from user interactions. The user ispresented with a set of candidate tuples and is asked to label them as positive or negativedepending on whether or not she would like the tuples as part of the join result. The goal isto quickly infer an arbitrary n-ary join predicate across two relations by keeping the numberof user interactions as minimal as possible. We assume no prior knowledge of the integrityconstraints between the involved relations. This kind of scenario occurs in severalapplication settings; such as data integration; reverse engineering of database queries; andconstraint inference. In such scenarios; the database instances may be too big to beskimmed. We explore the search space by using a set of strategies that let us prune what wecall" uninformative" tuples; and directly present to the user the informative ones ie; those …,Gestion de Données-Principes; Technologies et Applications (BDA),2014,20
Interactive join query inference with JIM,Angela Bonifati; Radu Ciucanu; Sławek Staworko,Abstract Specifying join predicates may become a cumbersome task in many situations eg;when the relations to be joined come from disparate data sources; when the values of theattributes carry little or no knowledge of metadata; or simply when the user is unfamiliar withquerying formalisms. Such task is recurrent in many traditional data managementapplications; such as data integration; constraint inference; and database denormalization;but it is also becoming pivotal in novel crowdsourcing applications. We present Jim (JoinInference Machine); a system for interactive join specification tasks; where the user infers ann-ary join predicate by selecting tuples that are part of the join result via Booleanmembership queries. The user can label tuples as positive or negative; while the systemallows to identify and gray out the uninformative tuples ie; those that do not add any …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,20
The Spicy system: towards a notion of mapping quality,Angela Bonifati; Giansalvatore Mecca; Alessandro Pappalardo; Salvatore Raunich; Gianvito Summa,Abstract We introduce the Spicy system; a novel approach to the problem of automaticallyselecting the best mappings among two data sources. Known schema mapping algorithmsrely on value correspondences--ie correspondences among semantically related attributes--to produce complex transformations among data sources. Spicy brings together schemamatching and mapping generation tools to further automate this process. A key observation;here; is that the quality of the mappings is strongly influenced by the quality of the inputcorrespondences. To address this problem; Spicy adopts a three-layer architecture; in whicha schema matching module is used to provide input to a mapping generation module. Then;a third module; the mapping verification module; is used to check candidate mappings andchoose the ones that represent better transformations of the source into the target.

Inference of quantitative models of bacterial promoters from time-series reporter gene data,Diana Stefan; Corinne Pinel; Stéphane Pinhal; Eugenio Cinquemani; Johannes Geiselmann; Hidde De Jong,The inference of regulatory interactions and quantitative models of gene regulation from time-series transcriptomics data has been extensively studied and applied to a range of problemsin drug discovery; cancer research; and biotechnology. The application of existing methodsis commonly based on implicit assumptions on the biological processes under study. First;the measurements of mRNA abundance obtained in transcriptomics experiments are takento be representative of protein concentrations. Second; the observed changes in geneexpression are assumed to be solely due to transcription factors and other specificregulators; while changes in the activity of the gene expression machinery and other globalphysiological effects are neglected. While convenient in practice; these assumptions areoften not valid and bias the reverse engineering process. Here we systematically …,PLoS computational biology,2015,14
Discovery and correctness of schema mapping transformations,Angela Bonifati; Giansalvatore Mecca; Paolo Papotti; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract Schema mapping is becoming pervasive in all data transformation; exchange; andintegration tasks. It brings to the surface the problem of differences and mismatches betweenheterogeneous formats and models; respectively; used in source and target databases to bemapped one to another. In this chapter; we start by describing the problem of schemamapping; its background; and technical implications. Then; we outline the early schemamapping systems; along with the new generation of schema mapping tools. Moving from theformer to the latter entailed a dramatic change in the performance of mapping generationalgorithms. Finally; we conclude the chapter by revisiting the query answering techniquesallowed by the mappings; and by discussing useful applications and future and currentdevelopments of schema mapping tools.,*,2011,14
Generating flexible workloads for graph databases,Guillaume Bagan; Angela Bonifati; Radu Ciucanu; George HL Fletcher; Aurélien Lemay; Nicky Advokaat,Abstract Graph data management tools are nowadays evolving at a great pace. Key driversof progress in the design and study of data intensive systems are solutions for syntheticgeneration of data and workloads; for use in empirical studies. Current graph generators;however; provide limited or no support for workload generation or are limited to fixed use-cases. Towards addressing these limitations; we demonstrate gMark; the first domain-andquery language-independent framework for synthetic graph and query workload generation.Its novel features are:(i) fine-grained control of graph instance and query workloadgeneration via expressive user-defined schemas;(ii) the support of expressive graph querylanguages; including recursion among other features; and;(iii) selectivity estimation of thegenerated queries. During the demonstration; we will showcase the highly tunable …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,12
A trichotomy for regular simple path queries on graphs,Guillaume Bagan; Angela Bonifati; Benoit Groz,Abstract Regular path queries (RPQs) select vertices connected by some path in a graph.The edge labels of such a path have to form a word that matches a given regular expression.We investigate the evaluation of RPQs with an additional constraint that prevents multipletraversals of the same vertices. Those regular simple path queries (RSPQs) quickly becomeintractable; even for basic languages such as (aa)* or a* ba*. In this paper; we establish acomprehensive classification of regular languages with respect to the complexity of thecorresponding regular simple path query problem. More precisely; we identify for whichlanguages RSPQs can be evaluated in polynomial time; and show that evaluation is NP-complete for languages outside this fragment. We thus fully characterize the frontier betweentractability and intractability for RSPQs; and we refine our results to show the following …,Proceedings of the 32nd ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI symposium on Principles of database systems,2013,12
HePToX: heterogeneous peer to peer XML databases,Angela Bonifati; Elaine Qing Chang; Terence Ho; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract: We study a collection of heterogeneous XML databases maintaining similar andrelated information; exchanging data via a peer to peer overlay network. In this setting; amediated global schema is unrealistic. Yet; users/applications wish to query the databasesvia one peer using its schema. We have recently developed HepToX; a P2P HeterogeneousXML database system. A key idea is that whenever a peer enters the system; it establishesan acquaintance with a small number of peer databases; possibly with different schema. Thepeer administrator provides correspondences between the local schema and theacquaintance schema using an informal and intuitive notation of arrows and boxes. Wedevelop a novel algorithm that infers a set of precise mapping rules between the schemasfrom these visual annotations.

Recentpapers point out the need of a more generalized exploitation of intensional knowledge in;eg; accessing integrated and cooperative data resource systems 13; 12; 4; 9; 1] queryoptimization and view maintenance 8; 5]; structuring of data warehouses and dataconstraints 7]. To describe and manipulate intensional knowledge about data; 4] proposes alogic formalism largely based on description logics to express interscheme properties incooperative database systems; whereas the Information Mainfold 12] uses an extension ofdescription logics with Datalog-like rules for the integration purposes. A difculty that isencountered while reasoning about intensional semantics of pre-existing databases is …,Description Logics,1997,11
A paradigm for learning queries on big data,Angela Bonifati; Radu Ciucanu; Aurélien Lemay; Sławek Staworko,Abstract Specifying a database query using a formal query language is typically achallenging task for non-expert users. In the context of big data; this problem becomes evenharder as it requires the users to deal with database instances of big sizes and hencedifficult to visualize. Such instances usually lack a schema to help the users specify theirqueries; or have an incomplete schema as they come from disparate data sources. In thispaper; we propose a novel paradigm for interactive learning of queries on big data; withoutassuming any knowledge of the database schema. The paradigm can be applied to differentdatabase models and a class of queries adequate to the database model. In particular; inthis paper we present two instantiations that validated the proposed paradigm for learningrelational join queries and for learning path queries on graph databases. Finally; we …,Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Bringing the Value of Big Data to Users (Data4U 2014),2014,10
Automatic extraction of database scheme semantic properties using knowledge discovery techniques,Angela Bonifati; Luigi Palopoli; Domenico Saccà; Domenico Ursino,Abstract This paper deals with the derivation of complex properties relating objectsbelonging to a set of database schemes and the exploitation of derived properties in queryoptimization and view maintenance problems. The derivation process has an iterative natureand works by case analysis over database schemes; in a way somehow similar to the wayknowledge discovery processes behave on database extensions: for this reason; we call itIntentional Knowledge Discovery. Complex properties have a fuzzy nature and arerepresented and manipulated using a fuzzy variant of Description Logics. The paperpresents detailed descriptions of procedures used to derive complex properties. As far asapplications are concerned; the paper illustrates several query optimization cases and aview maintenance algorithm both based on the availability of extracted complex …,Journal of Integrated Design and Process Science,1999,9
Towards a generic approach for schema matcher selection: Leveraging user pre-and post-match effort for improving quality and time performance,Fabien Duchateau,Interoperability between applications or bridges between data sources are required to allowoptimal information exchanges. Yet; some processes needed to bring this integra-tioncannot be fully automatized due to their complexity. One of these processes is calledmatching and it has now been studied for years. It aims at discovering semantic corre-spondences between data sources elements and is still largely performed manually. Thus;deploying large data sharing systems requires the (semi-) automatization of this matchingprocess. Many schema matching tools were designed to discover mappings betweenschemas. However; some of these tools intend to fulfill matching tasks with specific criteria;like a large scale scenario or the discovery of complex mappings. And contrary to ontologyalignment research field; there is no common platform to evaluate them. The abundance …,*,2009,8
Graph data exchange with target constraints,Iovka Boneva; Angela Bonifati; Radu Ciucanu,Data exchange is the problem of translating data structured under a source schemaaccording to a target schema and a set of source-to-target constraints known as schemamappings. In this paper; we investigate the problem of data exchange in a heterogeneoussetting; where the source is a relational database; the target is a graph database; and theschema mappings are defined across them. We study the classical problems considered indata exchange; namely the existence of solutions and query answering. We show that bothproblems are intractable in the presence of target constraints; already under significantrestrictions.,EDBT/ICDT Workshops-Querying Graph Structured Data (GraphQ),2015,7
SPAC: a distributed; peer-to-peer; secure and privacy-aware social space,Angela Bonifati; Hui Wendy Wang; Ruilin Liu,Abstract To support privacy-aware management of data in social spaces; the user personaldata needs to be stored at each user device; and shared only with a trusted subset of otherusers. To date; social spaces only have fairly limited access control capabilities; that do notprotect the possibly sensitive data of the users. In this demonstration; we showcase our SPAC system; a distributed; peer-to-peer; secure and privacy-aware social space system. SPAC is equipped with:(i) an SQL-based declarative distributed query language to specifywhich data to share and whom to share with. Such a language guarantees the fine-grainedaccess to the data;(ii) a fully-decentralized authorization that relies on classic cryptographicprotocols to provide robust and resilient key-based encryption for access controlenforcement; and (iii) an update-friendly access control mechanism; that also addresses …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,7
Synopsis data structures for xml databases: Models; issues; and research perspectives,Angela Bonifati; Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Due to the lack of efficient native XML database management systems; XML datamanipulation and query evaluation may be resource-consuming; and represent a bottleneckfor several computationally intensive applications. To overcome the above limitations; apossible solution consists in computing synopsis data structures from XML databases; iecompressed representations providing a" succinct" description of the original databaseswhile ensuring low computational overhead and high accuracy for many XML processingtasks. Specifically; these data structures are very useful for both selectivity estimation andapproximate query answering purposes. On the other hand; while synopsis data structureshave been widely applied to relational as well as multidimensional data; a full usage forXML data is still lacking. Inspired by these considerations; in this paper we discuss the …,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 2007. DEXA'07. 18th International Workshop on,2007,7
Fragmenting XML Documents via Structural Constraints.,Angela Bonifati; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Bruno Zinno,Abstract. XML query processors suffer from main-memory limitations that pre-vent them fromprocessing large XML documents. While content-based predi-cates can be used to projectdown parts of the documents; it may still be needed to resize the obtained projectionsaccording to structural constraints. In this paper; we consider size; tree-width and tree-depthconstraints to enable a structuredriven fragmentation of XML documents. Although a set ofheuristics performing this kind of fragmentation can be easily devised; a key problem isdetermining the values of structural constraints input to the above heuristics; given that thesearch space is prohibitive at large. To alle-viate the problem; we introduce special-purposestructure histograms that report the constraint values for the fragments of a given document.We then present a prediction algorithm that probes those histograms to output the …,ADBIS Research Communications,2006,7
Path Sequence-Based XML Query Processing.,Ioana Manolescu; Andrei Arion; Angela Bonifati; Andrea Pugliese,Abstract We present the path sequence storage model; a new logical model for storing XMLdocuments. This model partitions XML data and content according to the document paths;and uses ordered sequences as logical and physical structures. Besides being verycompact; this model has a strong impact on the efficiency of XQuery evaluation. Its mainadvantages are: fast and selective data access plans; intelligent combination of such plans;based on a summary of the document paths; and intelligent usage of a concise pathsummary.,BDA,2004,7
Functional dependencies unleashed for scalable data exchange,Angela Bonifati; Ioana Ileana; Michele Linardi,Abstract We address the problem of efficiently evaluating target functional dependencies(fds) in the Data Exchange (DE) process. Target fds naturally occur in many DE scenarios;including the ones in Life Sciences in which multiple source relations need to be structuredunder a constrained target schema. However; despite their wide use; target fds' evaluation isstill a bottleneck in the state-of-the-art DE engines. Systems relying on an all-SQL approachtypically do not support target fds unless additional information is provided. Alternatively; DEengines that do include these dependencies typically pay the price of a significant drop inperformance and scalability. In this paper; we present a novel chase-based algorithm thatcan efficiently handle arbitrary fds on the target. Our approach essentially relies onexploiting the interactions between source-to-target (st) tuple-generating dependencies …,Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2016,5
Interactive path query specification on graph databases,Angela Bonifati; Radu Ciucanu; Aurélien Lemay,Graph databases are becoming pervasive in several application scenarios such as theSemantic Web; social and biological networks; and geographical databases; to name a few.However; specifying a graph query is a cumbersome task for non-expert users becausegraph databases (i) are usually of large size hence difficult to visualize and (ii) do not carryproper metadata as there is no clear distinction between the instances and the schemas.

Distributed and secure access control in p2p databases,Angela Bonifati; Ruilin Liu; Hui Wendy Wang,Abstract The intent of peer data management systems (PDMS) is to share as much data aspossible. However; in many applications leveraging sensitive data; users demand adequatemechanisms to restrict the access to authorized parties. In this paper; we study a distributedaccess control model; where data items are stored; queried and authenticated in a totallydecentralized fashion. Our contribution focuses on the design of a comprehensiveframework for access control enforcement in PDMS sharing secure data; which blendspolicy rules defined in a declarative language with distributed key management schemes.The data owner peer decides which data to share and whom to share with by means of suchpolicies; with the data encrypted accordingly. To defend against malicious attackers who cancompromise the peers; the decryption keys are decomposed into pieces scattered …,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2010,5
XML lossy text compression: A preliminary study,Angela Bonifati; Marianna Lorusso; Domenica Sileo,Abstract Lossy compression techniques have been applied to image and text compression;yielding compression factors that are vastly superior to lossless compression schemes. Inthis paper; we present a preliminary study on a set of lossy transformations for XMLdocuments that preserve the semantics. Inspired by previous techniques; eg lossy textcompression and literate programming; we apply a simple algorithm to XML syntacticconstructs to loose superfluous layout information and redundant text. The obtained XMLkeeps the human-readability and machine-readability properties. Additionally; it can lead toa considerable reduction of its space occupancy and boost the application of conventionaltext compressors; thus representing a promising technology for several data managementtasks.,International XML Database Symposium,2009,5

Event Trace Independence of active behavior,Angela Bonifati; Stefano Ceri; Stefano Paraboschi,Abstract We present the Event Trace Independence (ETI); a novel property of active rulesexhibiting a behavior independent of the specific event sequence that had caused a statetransition. When employed in a distributed setting; this property supersedes the classicalproperty of confluence; which is not sufficient herein. We show that ETI is in generalundecidable and provide a sufficient condition; called invertibility; which offers a practicalway to demonstrate ETI.,Information Processing Letters,2005,4
Interactive mapping specification with exemplar tuples,Angela Bonifati; Ugo Comignani; Emmanuel Coquery; Romuald Thion,Abstract While schema mapping specification is a cumbersome task for data curationspecialists; it becomes unfeasible for non-expert users; who are unacquainted with thesemantics and languages of the involved transformations. In this paper; we present aninteractive framework for schema mapping specification suited for non-expert users. Theunderlying key intuition is to leverage a few exemplar tuples to infer the underlyingmappings and iterate the inference process via simple user interactions under the form ofboolean queries on the validity of the initial exemplar tuples. The approaches available sofar are mainly assuming pairs of complete universal data examples; which can be solelyprovided by data curation experts; or are limited to poorly expressive mappings.,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,3
Controlling diversity in benchmarking graph databases,Guillaume Bagan; Angela Bonifati; Radu Ciucanu; George HL Fletcher; Aurélien Lemay; Nicky Advokaat,ABSTRACT Massive graph data sets are pervasive in contemporary application domains.Hence; graph database systems are becoming increasingly important. In the study of thesesystems; it is vital that the research community has shared benchmarking solutions for thegeneration of database instances and query workloads having predictable and controllableproperties. Similarly to TPC benchmarks for relational databases; benchmarks for graphdatabases have been important drivers for the Semantic Web and graph data managementcommunities. Current benchmarks; however; are either limited to fixed graphs or graphschemas; or provide limited or no support for generating tailored query workloads toaccompany graph instances. To move the community forward; a benchmarking approachwhich overcomes these limitations is crucial. In this paper; we present the design and …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.08386,2015,3
XℓPPX: A lightweight framework for privacy preserving P2P XML databases in very large publish-subscribe systems,Angela Bonifati; Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Abstract The problem of supporting privacy preservation of XML databases within very largepublish-subscribe systems is rapidly gaining interest for both academic and industrialresearch. It becomes even more challenging when XML data are managed and deliveredaccording to the P2P paradigm; since malicious accesses and unpredictable attacks couldtake advantage from the totally-decentralized and untrusted nature of P2P networks. In thispaper; we propose X ℓ PPX; a distributed framework for very large publish-subscribesystems which supports (i) privacy-preserving fragmentation of XML documents stored inP2P XML databases; and (ii) the creation of trusted groups of peers by means of “self-certifying” XPath links. Furthermore; we present algorithms for querying privacy-preservingXML fragments in both schema-aware and schema-less mode; which are common …,*,2007,3

In this paper; we conduct an in-depth analytical study of the queries formulatedby end-users and harvested from large and up-to-date query logs from a wide variety of RDFdata sources. As opposed to previous studies; ours is the first assessment on a voluminousquery corpus; spanning over several years and covering many representative SPARQLendpoints. Apart from the syntactical structure of the queries; that exhibits already interestingresults on this generalized corpus; we drill deeper in the structural characteristics related tothe graph and hypergraph representation of queries.

Stability notions in synthetic graph generation: a preliminary study.,Wilco van Leeuwen; Angela Bonifati; George HL Fletcher; Nikolay Yakovets,ABSTRACT With the rise in adoption of massive graph data; it becomes increasinglyimportant to design graph processing algorithms which have predictable behavior as thegraph scales. This work presents an initial study of stability in the context of a schema-drivensynthetic graph generation. Specifically; we study the design of algorithms which generatehigh-quality sequences of graph instances. Some desirable features of these sequencesinclude monotonic containment of graph instances as they grow in size and consistency ofstructural properties across the sequence. Such stability features are important inunderstanding and explaining the scalability of many graph algorithms which havecrossinstance dependencies (eg; solutions for role detection in dynamic networks and graphquery processing).

Singular asymptotic solution along an elliptical edge for the Laplace equation in 3-D,Samuel Shannon; Victor Péron; Zohar Yosibash,Abstract Explicit asymptotic solutions are still unavailable for an elliptical crack or sharp V-notch in a three-dimensional elastic domain. Towards their derivation we first consider theLaplace equation. Both homogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on thesurfaces intersecting at the elliptical edge are considered. We derive these asymptoticsolutions and demonstrate; just as for the circular edge case; that these are composed ofthree series with eigenfunctions and shadows depending on two coordinates.,Engineering Fracture Mechanics,2015,2
Semantic Query Reformulation in Social PDMS,Angela Bonifati; Gianvito Summa; Esther Pacitti; Fady Draidi,Abstract: We consider social peer-to-peer data management systems (PDMS); where eachpeer maintains both semantic mappings between its schema and some acquaintances; andsocial links with peer friends. In this context; reformulating a query from a peer's schema intoother peer's schemas is a hard problem; as it may generate as many rewritings as the set ofmappings from that peer to the outside and transitively on; by eventually traversing the entirenetwork. However; not all the obtained rewritings are relevant to a given query. In this paper;we address this problem by inspecting semantic mappings and social links to find onlyrelevant rewritings. We propose a new notion of'relevance'of a query with respect to amapping; and; based on this notion; a new semantic query reformulation approach for socialPDMS; which achieves great accuracy and flexibility.

Pivotal to data exchange is the chase algorithm; which is a fixpointalgorithm to evaluate both source-to-target constraints and target constraints in the dataexchange process. In this paper; we investigate how new programming models such asMapReduce can be used to implement the chase on large-scale data sources. To the best ofour knowledge; how to exchange data at scale has not been investigated so far. We presentan initial solution for chasing source-to-target tuple generating dependencies and targettuple-generating dependencies; and discuss open issues that need to be addressed to …,Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2016,*
Mapping-equivalence and oid-equivalence of single-function object-creating conjunctive queries,Angela Bonifati; Werner Nutt; Riccardo Torlone; Jan Van den Bussche,Abstract Conjunctive database queries have been extended with a mechanism for objectcreation to capture important applications such as data exchange; data integration; andontology-based data access. Object creation generates new object identifiers in the resultthat do not belong to the set of constants in the source database. The new object identifierscan be also seen as Skolem terms. Hence; object-creating conjunctive queries can also beregarded as restricted second-order tuple-generating dependencies (SO-tgds); consideredin the data exchange literature. In this paper; we focus on the class of single-function object-creating conjunctive queries; or sifo CQs for short. The single-function symbol can be usedonly once in the head of the query. We give a new characterization for oid-equivalence ofsifo CQs that is simpler than the one given by Hull and Yoshikawa and places the …,The VLDB Journal,2016,*
To cite this version,Angela Bonifati; Radu Ciucanu; Slawomir Staworko,ABSTRACT Specifying join predicates may become a cumbersome task in many situationseg; when the relations to be joined come from disparate data sources; when the values ofthe attributes carry little or no knowledge of metadata; or simply when the user is unfamiliarwith querying formalisms. Such task is recurrent in many traditional data managementapplications; such as data integration; constraint inference; and database denormalization;but it is also becoming pivotal in novel crowdsourcing applications. We present Jim (JoinInference Machine); a system for interactive join specification tasks; where the user infers ann-ary join predicate by selecting tuples that are part of the join result via Booleanmembership queries. The user can label tuples as positive or negative; while the systemallows to identify and gray out the uninformative tuples ie; those that do not add any …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,*
Query Reformulation in PDMS Based on Social Relevance,Angela Bonifati; Gianvito Summa; Esther Pacitti; Fady Draidi,Abstract We consider peer-to-peer data management systems (PDMS); where each peermaintains mappings between its schema and some acquaintances; along with social linkswith peer friends. In this context; we deal with reformulating conjunctive queries from apeer's schema into other peer's schemas. Precisely; queries against a peer node arerewritten into queries against other nodes using schema mappings thus obtaining queryrewritings. Unfortunately; not all the obtained rewritings are relevant to a given query; as theinformation gain may be negligible or the peer is not worth exploring. On the other hand; theexistence of social links with peer friends might be useful to get relevant rewritings.Therefore; we propose a new notion of 'relevance'of a query with respect to a mapping thatencompasses both a local relevance (the relevance of the query wrt the mapping) and a …,*,2014,*
Algebraic Techniques for XML View Maintenance,Angela Bonifati; Martin Goodfellow; Ioana Manolescu; Domenica Sileo; Domenica Sileo Algebraic Incremental; Inria Links,Materialized views can bring important performance benefits when querying XMLdocuments. In the presence of XML document changes; materialized views need to beupdated to faithfully reflect the changed document. In this work; we present an algebraicapproach for propagating source updates to XML materialized views expressed in apowerful XML tree pattern formalism. Our approach differs from the state of the art in the areain two important ways. First; it relies on set-oriented; algebraic operations; to be contrastedwith node-based previous approaches. Second; it exploits state-of-the-art features of XMLstores and XML query evaluation engines; notably XML structural identifiers and associatedstructural join algorithms. We present algorithms for determining how updates should bepropagated to views; and highlight the benefits of our approach over existing algorithms …,*,2013,*

Optimizing XML Compression in XQueC,Andrei Arion; Angela Bonifati; Ioana Manolescu; Andrea Pugliese,Abstract We present our approach to the problem of optimizing compression choices in thecontext of the XQueC compressed XML database system. In XQueC; data items areaggregated into containers; which are further grouped to be compressed together. This way;XQueC is able to exploit data commonalities and to perform query evaluation in thecompressed domain; with the aim of improving both compression and queryingperformance. However; different compression algorithms have different performance andsupport different sets of operations in the compressed domain. Therefore; choosing how togroup containers and which compression algorithm to apply to each group is a challengingissue. We address this problem through an appropriate cost model and a suitable blend ofheuristics which; based on a given query workload; are capable of driving appropriate …,Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings,2008,*
The XQueC Project: Compressing and Querying XML,Andrei Arion; Angela Bonifati; Ioana Manolescu; Andrea Pugliese,Abstract We outline in this paper the main contributions of the XQueC project. XQueC;namely XQuery processor and Compressor; is the first compression tool to seamlessly allowXQuery queries in the compressed domain. It includes a set of data structures; that basicallyshred the XML document into suitable chunks linked to each other; thus disagreeing withthe'homomorphic'principle so far adopted in previous XML compressors. According to thisprinciple; the compressed document is homomorphic to the original document. Moreover; inorder to avoid the time consumption due to compressing and decompressing intermediatequery results; XQueC applies 'lazy'decompression by issuing the queries directly in thecompressed domain.,Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings,2008,*

Towards a Lightweight Framework for Privacy Preserving P2P XML Databases,Angela Bonifati; Alfredo Cuzzocrea,The problem of securing XML databases is rapidly gaining interest for both academic andindustrial research. It becomes even more challenging when XML data are managed anddelivered according to the P2P paradigm; as malicious attacks could take advantage fromthe totally-decentralized and untrusted nature of P2P networks. Starting from theseconsiderations; in this paper we propose the guidelines of a distributed framework forsupporting (i) secure fragmentation of XML documents into P2P XML databases by means oflightweight XPath-based identifiers; and (it) the creation of trusted groups of peers by meansof" self-certifying" XPath links that exploit the benefits of well-known fingerprintingtechniques,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2006.

This work presents an initial study of stability in the context of a schema-drivensynthetic graph generation. Specifically; we study the design of algorithms which generatehigh-quality sequences of graph instances. Some desirable features of these sequencesinclude monotonic containment of graph instances as they grow in size and consistency ofstructural properties across the sequence. Such stability features are important inunderstanding and explaining the scalability of many graph algorithms which havecrossinstance dependencies (eg; solutions for role detection in dynamic networks and graphquery processing). We implement a preliminary approach in the recently proposed …,*,*,*
Graph Queries: Generation; Evaluation and Learning,Angela Bonifati,Several modern graph query languages are capable of expressing sophisticated graphqueries; which return nodes connected by arbitrarily complex paths. Such paths can besynthesized by regular expressions and often involve recursion. Such graph queries areknown as Regular Path Queries and correspond to Property Paths in Sparql 1.1. Recently;with my colleagues I have been investigating regular path queries and their combinations bylooking at the generation problem [1; 2; 3; 10]; the complexity of query evaluation [5] and thelearning problem [9; 7; 6; 8]. Precisely; we focused on schema-driven generation of complexand broad graph queries with user-defined features; on the complexity of the evaluation ofregular simple path queries and on learning algorithms for regular path queries. In this talk; Iwill begin with a brief recap of graph queries and their expressive power. I will then …,*,*,*

How do weknow that the mappings captured using the inferred rules are meaningful? What can we sayabout the class of mappings (transformations) that are captured by the rules? To answerthese questions; in this appendix we introduce a small set of simple but powerful algebraicoperators for expressing transformations between (database instances of) DTDs. Wedemonstrate that transformations captured by expressions in this algebra are expressible asa set of TreeLog rules. The operators consist of three main groups:(1) unnest and nest;(2)flip and flop; and (3) split and merge. Additionally; we also allow individual node insertion;deletion; and tag modification for “completeness”. These latter operations are needed to …,*,*,*

A key step in any of theseintegration problems is that of matching source descriptions; ie; solving the so calledschema matching problem [13]. Informally speaking; given two repositories; R and S; findinga match between them means to derive a number of mappings between elements of R andsome corresponding elements of S. To give an example of fairly high generality; suppose Ris a relational database with a customer table with attributes (name; email;shippingAddress); suppose S is an XML repository; with a person element; whose childrenare (fidlName; email; city; zipCode; state); then a match between R and 5 might contain anumber of mapping elements; as follows.
