Factors affecting the sensitivity of electrostatic ultrasonic transducers,Jarmo Hietanen; P Mattila; Jyrki Stor-Pellinen; Fabio Tsuzuki; Heli Vaataja; Ken Sasaki; M Luukkala,Abstract The sensitivity of an electrostatic transducer determines the range of pulse-echodetection. Maximum sensitivity can be achieved by increasing the bias voltage within certainlimits and by using a light membrane. The tension of the membrane was not found to affectthe transducer's sensitivity. By using a uniformly grooved backplate the acoustic propertiesof the transducer can be optimized. The different sensitivity factors of the electrostaticultrasonic transducer were confirmed with experimental results. High sensitivity can beachieved by using well manufactured backplates with shallow grooves and a small ridgeangle.,Measurement Science and Technology,1993,32

In the case of a multivariate autoregressive (MAR) spectrum the conventionalcoherence analysis can be applied. However; since we are able to decompose the MARspectrum; there is a possibility to gain more information through coherence analysis basedon conditioned spectra than with conventional methods. The authors formulate thecoherence analysis based on the conditioned MAR spectra (reduced and noise conditionedspectra) by giving related definitions for partial and multiple coherences.,Acoustics; Speech; and Signal Processing; 1994.

The fuzzy front end of experience design,Eija Kaasinen; Heli Väätäjä; Hannu Karvonen; Yichen Lu,Abstract The basic idea behind Experience Design approach is that before ideating thesolution; you define what experience to design for. This is a critical point in a design process;because the experience goal needs to be appropriate for the target context of use; in linewith the brand experience; and meaningful to truly engage users. In the early phases of theexperience design process; in the fuzzy front end; there are several sources that can guideexperience goal setting. One important way is empathic understanding of the users' worldand stepping into the users' shoes; but there are also other sources of insight and inspirationfor setting the experiential goals such as brand promise; technology and societal trends aswell as mere vision of renewal. In this workshop; we aim to collect examples of the fuzzyfront end of the experience design process and analyze how the different sources of …,Proceedings of the 8th Nordic Conference on Human-Computer Interaction: Fun; Fast; Foundational,2014,3

Information Visualization Heuristics in Practical Expert Evaluation,Heli Väätäjä; Jari Varsaluoma; Tomi Heimonen; Katariina Tiitinen; Jaakko Hakulinen; Markku Turunen; Harri Nieminen; Petri Ihantola,Abstract While traditional HCI heuristics can be used to find usability issues also frominformation visualization systems; specialized heuristics tailored for the informationvisualization (InfoViz) domain can be more effective and focus on the special characteristicsof these systems. In this study; we describe the application of ten information visualizationheuristics from prior research and their testing in practical heuristic evaluation. We found thatthe selected heuristics were useful with good coverage in our application case. However;based on our observations; we argue that interaction; veracity; and aesthetics relatedheuristics should be added to the previously used set. The lack of domain knowledge madethe evaluators somewhat uneasy with their capability to carry out the investigation in-depth.We suggest to train domain experts with understanding of the data and application …,Proceedings of the Beyond Time and Errors on Novel Evaluation Methods for Visualization,2016,2

Experience design for multiple customer touchpoints,Virpi Roto; Heli Väätäjä; Effie Law; Rachel Powers,Abstract A burgeoning topic in the field of UX is designing users' experiences in differentchannels and touchpoints between an organization and the user. The work so far haslargely focused on responsive transmedia design. However; when UX design meets servicedesign; a deeper and broader perspective of the topic emerges: how users' experiencesevolve along the customer journey through different touchpoints. Multi-touchpointexperience design aims to build a harmonious experience journey through the touchpoints.This one-day workshop has four objectives:(i) to clarify the terminology in this emergingresearch area;(ii) to understand the opportunities and challenges of multi-touchpointexperience design through case studies in different application contexts;(iii) to identifyintriguing research themes; and (iv) to build a community in this area.,Proceedings of the 9th Nordic Conference on Human-Computer Interaction,2016,1

Quality management of user-generated content in participatory journalism,Satu Jumisko-Pyykkö; Heli Väätäjä; Markus Jaakola,Abstract Newsrooms utilize increasing amounts of user-generated content (UGC) in newsmaking. However; managing the quality of UGC is challenging. Our three-phase studyidentifies qualities of newsworthy UGC; and ways to enhance the quality of contributions byonline feedback. Review of 31 UGC-driven websites revealed as the most used methods ofimproving the quality of contributions flagging of inappropriate content; counts of sharing tosocial media services; ratings; user's activity statistics; and badges. Interviews of newseditors and reader reporters showed a conceptual difference in the qualities of good newscontent. Interviewed reader reporters expressed the feedback from the newsroom as themost important for their development in addition to seeing the examples by other readerreporters. Content was perceived as more important than competition in case of readers' …,Proceedings of the 26th Australian Computer-Human Interaction Conference on Designing Futures: the Future of Design,2014,1
Competitive advantage with user experience-Findings from three MEI companies,Heli Väätäjä; Aija Paananen; Marko Seppänen,Abstract Suppliers in metal and engineering industry (MEI) are turning to user experience asa possible source of competitive advantage and value creation for the customer. In thisarticle we describe why and how user experience is used in and approached by thesuppliers based on thirteen interviews in three Finnish MEI companies. User experiencewas perceived both as strategic tool within the company and a source of differentiation in themarket. The greatest challenges in building the value argumentation for user experiencewere perceived in creating a solid argumentation and showing the link of user experience tothe monetary value it creates for the customer. A tentative framework for linking userexperience and value is presented.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT],ISPIM Conference Proceedings,2012,1
Assessing the applicability of modular playability heuristics for evaluating health-enhancing games,Katja Suhonen; Heli Väätäjä,Abstract An increasing amount of health-related games are available; in which healthenhancement is included either by having health topics as educational content; makingplayers move physically; or by combinations of these approaches in various degrees.Heuristic evaluation is widely used as a low-cost expert evaluation method in software andgame development for assessing usability problems. The goal of our research was to assesshow modular playability heuristics work in the evaluation of different types of health games.Based on a literature review we collected a six-module set of playability heuristics. Threedifferent games with direct or indirect health enhancing effects were evaluated with thederived set of heuristics. The results suggest that playability heuristics are useful inevaluating various types of health-enhancing games; provided that the heuristic modules …,Proceedings of the 14th International Academic MindTrek Conference: Envisioning Future Media Environments,2010,1

Submit manuscript,Heli Väätäjä; Virpi Roto; Effie Law; Torkil Clemmensen,Today; experiential aspects are considered when designing ICT based solutions forconsumer markets. Surprisingly; however; when interactive solutions and tools for workcontexts are being designed; the experiential aspects often are not considered in the designprocess (Lu & Roto; 2015). Work tools; which are used to accomplish work-related tasks; cancontribute to work satisfaction and work engagement; as well as to general well-being on thejob. Similarly; interactive technologies and solutions beyond work tools that support well-being at work can facilitate work engagement.Work engagement refers to a positive work-related state of fulfillment. It is characterized by descriptive attributes such as vigor;dedication; and absorption (Schaufeli et al.; 2002).
