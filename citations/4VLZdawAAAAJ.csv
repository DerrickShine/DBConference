Semantics and implementation of schema evolution in object-oriented databases,Jay Banerjee; Won Kim; Hyoung-Joo Kim; Henry F Korth,Abstract Object-oriented programming is well-suited to such data-intensive applicationdomains as CAD/CAM; AI; and OIS (office information systems) with multimedia documents.At MCC we have built a prototype object-oriented database system; called ORION. It addspersistence and sharability to objects created and manipulated in applications implementedin an object-oriented programming environment. One of the important requirements of theseapplications is schema evolution; that is; the ability to dynamically make a wide variety ofchanges to the database schema. In this paper; following a brief review of the object-oriented data model that we support in ORION; we establish a framework for supportingschema evolution; define the semantics of schema evolution; and discuss itsimplementation.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1987,985

Extended algebra and calculus for nested relational databases,Mark A Roth; Herry F Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,Abstract Relaxing the assumption that relations are always in First-Normal-Form (1NF)necessitates a reexamination of the fundamentals of relational database theory. In this paperwe take a first step towards unifying the various theories of¬ 1NF databases. We start bydetermining an appropriate model to couch our formalisms in. We then define an extendedrelational calculus as the theoretical basis for our¬ 1NF database query language. Wedefine a minimal extended relational algebra and prove its equivalence to the¬ 1NFrelational calculus. We define a class of¬ 1NF relations with certain “good” properties andextend our algebra operators to work within this domain. We prove certain desirableequivalences that hold only if we restrict our language to this domain.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1988,465

Covering indexes for branching path queries,Raghav Kaushik; Philip Bohannon; Jeffrey F Naughton; Henry F Korth,Abstract In this paper; we ask if the traditional relational query acceleration techniques ofsummary tables and covering indexes have analogs for branching path expression queriesover tree-or graph-structured XML data. Our answer is yes---the forward-and-backwardindex already proposed in the literature can be viewed as a structure analogous to asummary table or covering index. We also show that it is the smallest such index that coversall branching path expression queries. While this index is very general; our experimentsshow that it can be so large in practice as to offer little performance improvement overevaluating queries directly on the data. Likening the forward-and-backward index to acovering index on all the attributes of several tables; we devise an index definition schemeto restrict the class of branching path expressions being indexed.

Database system issues in nomadic computing,R Alonso; HF Korth,Abstract Mobile computers and wireless networks are emerging technologies that will soonbe available to a wide variety of computer users. Unlike earlier generations of laptopcomputers; the new generation of mobile computers can be an integrated part of adistributed computing environment; one in which users change physical location frequently.The result is a new computing paradigm; nomadic computing. This paradigm will affect thedesign of much of our current systems software; including that of database systems. Thispaper discusses in some detail the impact of nomadic computing on a number of traditionaldatabase system concepts. In particular; we point out how the reliance on short-livedbatteries changes the cost assumptions underlying query processing. In these systems;power consumption competes with resource utilization in the definition of cost metrics. We …,Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD Conference on the Management of Data,1993,326

A transaction model for multidatabase systems,Sharad Mehrotra; Rajeev Rastogi; Abraham Silberschatz; Henry F Korth,A transaction model for multidatabase system (MDBS) applications in which globalsubtransactions may be either compensatable or retriable is presented. In this modelcompensation and retrying are used for recovery purposes. However; since such executionsmay no longer consist of atomic transactions; a correctness criterion that ensures thattransactions see consistent database states is necessary. A commit protocol and aconcurrency control scheme that ensures that all generated schedules are correct are alsopresented. The commit protocol eliminates the problem of blocking; which is characteristicsof the standard 2PC protocol. The concurrency control protocol can be used in any MDBSenvironment irrespective of the concurrency control protocol followed by the local DBMSs inorder to ensure serializability.,Distributed Computing Systems; 1992.; Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on,1992,207
SQL/NF: a query language for¬ 1NF relational databases,Mark A Roth; Henry F Korth; Don S Batory,Abstract There is growing interest in abandoning the first-normal-form assumption on whichthe relational database model is based. This interest has developed from a desire to extendthe applicability of the relational model beyond traditional data-processing application. Inthis paper; we extend one of the most widely used relational query languages; SQL; tooperate on non-first-normal-form relations. In this framework; well allow attributes to berelation-valued as well as atomic-valued (eg integer or character). A relation which occursas the value of an attribute in a tuple of another relation is said to be nested. Our extendedlanguage; called SQL/NF; includes all of the power of standard SQL as well as the ability todefine nested relations in the data definition language and query these relations directly inthe extended data manipulation language.

In this paper; we present results of a simulation study for threerecently introduced protocols that guarantee global serializability and transaction atomicitywithout resorting to the two-phase commit protocol. The protocols analyzed in this paperinclude a global locking protocol [10]; a “pessimistic” protocol based on a replication graph[5]; and an “optimistic” protocol based on a replication graph [7]. The results of the studyshow a wide range of practical applicability for the lazy replica-update approach employedin these protocols.

Replication and consistency: Being lazy helps sometimes,Yuri Breitbart; Henry F Korth,Abstract The issue of data replication is considered in the context of a restricted systemmodel motivated by certain distributed data-warehousing applications. A new replicamanagement protocol is defined for this model in which gIobaI serializability is ensured;while message overhead and deadlock frequency are less than in previously publishedwork. The advantages of the protocol arise from its use of a lazy approach to update ofsecondary copies of replicated data and the use of a new concept; virtual sites; to reduce thepotential for conflict among global transactions.,Proceedings of the sixteenth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1997,155
Formal model of correctness without serializabilty,Henry K Korth; Gregory Speegle,Abstract In the classical approach to transaction processing; a concurrent execution isconsidered to be correct if it is equivalent to a non-concurrent schedule. This notion ofcorrectness is called serializability. Serializability has proven to be a highly useful conceptfor transaction systems for data-processing style applications. Recent interest in applyingdatabase concepts to applications in computer-aided design; office information systems; etc.has resulted in transactions of relatively long duration. For such transactions; there areserious consequences to requiring serializability as the notion of correctness. Specifically;such systems either impose long-duration waits or require the abortion of long transactions.In this paper; we define a transaction model that allows for several alternative notions ofcorrectness without the requirement of serializability. After introducing the model; we …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1988,155
On long-duration CAD transactions,Henry F Korth; Won Kim; François Bancilhon,Abstract The conventional model of transactions is based on the notions of serializability andatomicity. This transaction model has served conventional data-processing applicationswell. However; it is not appropriate for a CAD environment. Transactions in a CADenvironment are of long duration and represent interactive modifications to a complexdesign. Application of the standard techniques to ensure atomicity and serializability resultsin intolerably long waits or the undoing of a significant amount of work. In this paper; we firstreview a model of CAD transactions which allows a group of cooperating designers to arriveat a complex design without being forced to wait over a long duration; and which also allowsa group of designers to collaborate on a design with another group by assigning subtasks.We then discuss concurrency control and recovery schemes that implement the model …,Information Sciences,1988,146

An optimistic commit protocol for distributed transaction management,Eliezer Levy; Henry F Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,Abstract. A major disadvantage of the two-phase commit might be severe. At each site; andfor each transaction (2 PC) protocol is the potential unbounded delay that transactions mayhave to endure if certain failures occur. By using compensating transactions; we obtain arevised 2PC protocol that overcomes these difficulties. In the revised protocol; locks arereleased as soou as a site votes to commit a transaction; thereby solving the indefiniteblocking problem of 2PC. If finally the transaction is to be aborted; then its effects are undonesemantically using a compensating transaction. Therefore; Semantic; rather than standard;atomicity is guaranteed. Relaxing standard atomicity interacts in a subtle way withcorrectness and concurrency control issues. Accordingly; a correctness criterion is proposedthat is most appropriate when atomicity is given up for semantic atomicity. The …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1991,120

Formal aspects of concurrency control in long-duration transaction systems using the NT/PV model,Henry F Korth; Greg Speegle,Abstract In the typical database system; an execution is correct if it is equivalent to someserial execution. This criterion; called serializability; is unacceptable for new databaseapplications which require long-duration transactions. We present a new transaction modelwhich allows correctness criteria more suitable for these applications. This model combinesthree enhancements to the standard model: nested transactions; explicit predicates; andmultiple versions. These features yield the name of the new model; nested transactions withpredicates and versions; or NT/PV. The modular nature of the NT/PV model allows astraightforward representation of simple systems. It also provides a formal framework fordescribing complex interactions. The most complex interactions the model allows can becaptured by a protocol which exploits all of the semantics available to the NT/PV model …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1994,88
Non-serializable executions in heterogeneous distributed database systems,Sharad Mehrotra; Rajeev Rastogi; Henry F Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,The concept of serializability has been the traditionally accepted notion of correctness indatabase systems. However; in a heterogeneous distributed database system (HDBMS)environment; ensuring serializability is a difficult task mainly due to the desire of preservingthe local autonomy of the participating local database systems. The authors introduce a newcorrectness criterion fur HDBMSs; two-level serializability (2LSR); and show that it preservesdatabase consistency in several HDBMS models. Further; they present a simple protocol forensuring that schedules in an HDBMS environment are 2LSR.

The design of¬ 1NF relational databases into nested normal form,Mark A Roth; Henry F Korth,Abstract We develop new algorithms for the design of non first normal form relationaldatabases that are in nested normal form. Previously; a set of given multivalueddependencies and those multivalued dependencies implied by given functionaldependencies were used to obtain a nested normal form decomposition of a scheme. Thismethod ignored the semantic distinction between functional and multivalued dependenciesand utilized only full multivalued dependencies in the design process. We propose newalgorithms which take advantage of this distinction; and use embedded multivalueddependencies to enhance the decomposition. This results in further elimination ofredundancy due to functional dependencies in nested normal form designs.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1987,80

Null values in nested relational databases,Mark A Roth; Henry F Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,Summary The desire to extend the applicability of the relational model beyond traditionaldata-processing applications has stimulated interest in nested or non-first normal formrelations in which the attributes of a relation can take on values which are sets or evenrelations themselves. In this paper; we study the role of null values in the nested relationalmodel using an open world assumption. We extend the traditional theory and study theproperties of extended operators for nested relations containing nulls. The no-information;unknown; and non-existent interpretation of nulls are discussed and the meaning of “emptyset” is clarified. Finally; contrary to several previous results; we determine that the traditionalaxiomatization of functional and multivalued dependencies is valid in the presence of nulls.,Acta Informatica,1989,72

A theory of relaxed atomicity,Eliezer Levy; Henry F Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,Abstract. Supporting atomicity of multi-site transactions in a distributed transactionmanagement system is equated with long-duration delays; blocking; and loss of autonomy ofthe individual sites. The two-phase Commit protocol embodies these problems. The focus ofthis paper is on an alternative notion of relaxed atomicity where these difficult ies arealleviated. Relaxed atomicity is characterized by an asynchronous process of recoveringfrom uncoordinated local decisions as to whether to commit or abort a multi-site transaction;and finally coercing a unanimous outcome. The consequent atomicity notion is weaker thanthe standard all-or-nothing atomicity; as transactions with discrepant commit decisions arerecovered semantically rather than physically. A formal model that unifies the two dualmethods of semantic recovery; namely compensation and retry; is constructed.

Optimizing view queries in ROLEX to support navigable result trees,Philip Bohannon; Sumit Ganguly; Henry F Korth; PPS Narayan; Pradeep Shenoy,Relational databases support simultaneous “OLTP” access via SQL and XML interfaces.ROLEX provides a novel approach to resolving this duality by offering the ability to accesslive; nonmaterialized XML views of relational data; directly and efficiently; through anavigable virtual DOM interface. The system avoids the overhead of tagging and parsing;which limits the performance of existing middleware systems.

Introduction to mobile computing,Tomasz Imielinski; Henry Korth,Abstract The rapidly expanding technology of cellular communication; wireless LANs; andsatellite services will make information accessible anywhere and at any time. In the nearfuture; tens of millions of people will carry a portable palmtop or laptop computer. Smallerunits; often called personal digital assistants or personal communicators; will run on AAbatteries and may have only a small memory; larger ones will be powerful laptop computerswith large memories and powerful processors. Regardless of size; most mobile computerswill be equipped with a wireless connection to the fixed part of the network; and; perhaps; toother mobile computers. The resulting computing environment; which is often referred to asmobile or nomadic computing; no longer requires users to maintain a fixed and universallyknown position in the network and enables almost unrestricted mobility.

Long-duration transactions in software design projects,Henry F Korth; Gregory D Speegle,An example of a software development application is considered; and the formal model of H.Korth and G. Speegle (1988) is applied to show how this example could be represented as aset of database transactions. It is shown that; although the standard notion of correctness(serializability) is too strict; the notion of correctness in the Korth and Speegle model allowssufficient concurrency with acceptable overhead. An extrapolation is made from thisexample to draw some conclusions regarding the potential usefulness of a formal approachto the management of long-duration design transactions.,Data Engineering; 1990.

Database hash-join algorithms on multithreaded computer architectures,Philip Garcia; Henry F Korth,Abstract As the performance gap between main memory and modern processors widens;database algorithms must be adapted to be" architecture-aware" for optimal performance.We address this issue using the computation of hash join; one of the most importantoperations in database query processing; to study the impact of simultaneous multithreading(SMT) and main-memory latency (cache misses) on performance. Prior work [8] has studiedcache misses on a simulation based on the Compaq ES40. Our results are obtained bymeasuring the performance of actual hardware (Intel Pentium and Xeon; and AMD Opteron)first for the single-threaded version of the hash-join algorithm used in the prior work and anew version designed for multiple threads. We found that hardware prefetching from main-memory data into CPU cache as implemented in the architectures we tested significantly …,Proceedings of the 3rd Conference on Computing Frontiers,2006,42

Data models,Avi Silberschatz; Henry F Korth; S Sudarshan,Underlying the structure of a database is a data model; a collection of conceptual tools fordescribing the real-world entities to be modeled in the database and the relationshipsamong these entities. Data models differ in the primitives available for describing data and inthe amount of semantic detail that can be expressed. The various data models proposed fallinto three different groups: object-based logical models; record-based logical models; andphysical data models. Physical data models; used to describe data at the lowest level;capture aspects of database system implementation not covered in this article. Thus ourfocus here is on the objectbased and record-based logical models. Recently a new model;the object-relational model; has been developed. It merges the object-oriented data modelwith the dominant record-based model; the relational model. We discuss this model …,ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR),1996,39
Adaptive commitment for real-time distributed transactions,Nandit Soparkar; Eliezer Levy; H Korth; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract Real-time distributed transaction management systems are useful for both real-timeand highperformance database applications. Guaranteeing response times in suchenvironments is difcult to achieve mainly due to the inherent asynchrony present. Thestandard approach to distributed transaction management is to employ the two-phaselocking scheme in each of the participating sites; and to coordinate the executions of thevarious subtransactions through the use of the two-phase commit protocol. Such anapproach ensures the atomicity and serializability properties of the transactions.Unfortunately; the unpredictability; the cost and the fault-tolerance properties of the two-phase commit protocol render it unsuitable for real-time applications. The approach taken inthis paper is to identify ways in which a commit protocol can be made adaptive in the …,University of Texas at Austin; Austin; TX,1992,38

On correctness of nonserializable executions,Rajeev Rastogi; Sharad Mehrotra; Yuri Breitbart; Henry F Korth; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract In a number of application environments (eg; computer aided design);serializability; the traditionally accepted notion of correctness has been found to be toorestrictive; and a number of alternate criteria have been proposed in the literature. One suchcriterion ispredicate-wise serializability (PWSR) which requires only restrictions of schedulesthat access subsets of the database over which integrity constraints are defined to beserializable. In this paper; we identify restrictions on the structure of transaction programs;their concurrent execution; and their access characteristics under which PWSR schedulespreserve database consistency.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,1998,33
Query languages for nested relational databases,Henry Korth; Mark Roth,Abstract The nested relational model has proven useful in modeling databases of complexobjects. In this paper we consider query languages designed specifically to exploit thepower of this model. First; formal query languages are considered: a relational calculusdefining the desired power of nested relational languages; and a relational algebra thatprovides a procedural language suitable for query optimization. Next; two higher-levellanguages are discussed and compared; SQL/NF; and Heidelberg Data Base Language(HDBL). Two extensions of these languages are considered. X-SQL/NF is a role-joinextended version of SQL/NF that incorporates an ISA hierarchy into the semantics of thelanguage. A recursive version of HDBL allows the definition of a transitive closure operationon nested relations.,Nested Relations and Complex Objects in Databases,1989,33
Deadlock freedom using edge locks,Henry F Korth,Abstract We define a series of locking protocols for database systems that all have threemain features: freedom from deadlock; multiple granularity; and support for generalcollections of locking primitives. A rooted directed acyclic graph is used to represent multiplegranularities; as in System R. Deadlock freedom is guaranteed by extending the System Rprotocol to require locks on edges of the graph in addition to the locks required on nodes.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1982,33

An almost-serial protocol for transaction execution in main-memory database systems,Stephen Blott; Henry F Korth,This chapter has investigated the issue of concurrency in main-memory databases.Focusing primarily on response-time requirements in telecommunication applications; onehas proposed a serial protocol (SP) for transaction execution in main-memory systems. Thenovelty of SP lies in the use of timestamps and mutexes to allow parallelism betweentransaction executions and log flushing. It allows transactions to begin processing beforetheir predecessors have completed flushing the log; while still ensuring that no transactioncommits in the state of having read uncommitted data. By implementing SP atop the DataBlitz Main-Memory Database System; one was able to compare the performance of SPagainst that of strict 2PL. The results indicate the potential for a significant performancegainmup to a factor of tenmin terms of both response time and throughput. These gains …,*,2002,28
Ensuring consistency in multidatabases by preserving two-level serializability,Sharad Mehrotra; Rajeev Rastogi; Henry F Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,Abstract The concept of serializability has been the traditionally accepted correctnesscriterion in database systems. However in multidatabase systems (MDBSs); ensuring globalserializability is a difficult task. The difficulty arises due to the heterogeneity of theconcurrency control protocols used by the participating local database managementsystems (DBMSs); and the desire to preserve the autonomy of the local DBMSs. In general;solutions to the global serializability problem result in executions with a low degree ofconcurrency. The alternative; relaxed serializability; may result in data inconsistency. In thisarticle; we introduce a systematic approach to relaxing the serializability requirement inMDBS environments. Our approach exploits the structure of the integrity constraints and thenature of transaction programs to ensure consistency without requiring executions to be …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1998,28
The double life of the transaction abstraction: Fundamental principle and evolving system concept,Henry F Korth,Abstract The transaction concept in computing goes back to the early days of computerizeddata processing. It has developed and evolved over the years both in terms of formal theoryand practical application. This evolutionary process has been driven in large part byapplications that require transactionlike properties. Newly emerging applications includeseveral that involve people in a time-dependent role. The new forms of human involvementin transaction processing required by these applications are generating new systemslevelchallenges. Likewise; these needs present challenges and opportunities from a theoreticalstandpoint.

Pipelined hash-join on multithreaded architectures,Philip Garcia; Henry F Korth,Abstract Multi-core and multithreaded processors present both opportunities and challengesin the design of database query processing algorithms. Previous work has shown thepotential for performance gains; but also that; in adverse circumstances; multithreading canactually reduce performance. This paper examines the performance of a pipeline of hash-join operations when executing on multithreaded and multicore processors. We examine theoptimal number of threads to execute and the partitioning of the workload across thosethreads. We then describe a buffer-management scheme that minimizes cache conflictsamong the threads. Additionally we compare the performance of full materialization of theoutput at each stage in the pipeline versus passing pointers between stages.,Proceedings of the 3rd international workshop on Data management on new hardware,2007,24
Data logging: A method for efficient data updates in constantly active RAIDs,Eran Gabber; Henry F Korth,RAIDs (Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks) are a set of disks organized to achieveparallel I/O to multiple disks and to provide tolerance of disk failures. RAIDs offer theseadvantages at the cost of additional space and additional disk I/O for writes. Previousmethods of reducing this I/O overhead suffered from such problems as requiring periodsduring which data is reorganized and not available; destroying the physical locality of data;or weakening the RAID's fault-tolerance properties. We propose a new method called datalogging which reduces the I/O overhead without requiring periodic downtime forreorganization. Instead; incremental maintenance can be performed concurrently withroutine processing. This is particularly advantageous in applications requiring" 24/spltimes/7" uptime.

It solves these problems by dynamicallygenerating the" required version" of a Web object based on client preferences andcapabilities.

Strict histories in object-based database systems,Rajeev Rastogi; Henry F Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,Atomicity and durability are integral properties of transactions. Atomicity states that all theoperations associated with a transaction must be executed to completion; or none at all.Durability states that the effects of a committed transaction are never undone (that is; effectsof a committed transaction are persistent). If a history resulting from the concurrent executionof transactions is to preserve the atomicity and durability properties; then it must be at leastrecoverable [BHG87](a history is a sequence of read; write; commit; and abort operationsbelonging to all the transactions executed in the system). A history h is recoverable if for anytwo transactions Ti and Tj in h; if Tj reads the value of a data item written by Ti; then Ticommits or aborts before Tj commits. In a recoverable history; it is possible to undo theeffects of aborted transactions without undoing the effects of committed transactions …,Proceedings of the twelfth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1993,23
Databases with deadline and contingency constraints,Nandit Soparkar; Henry F.  Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,Real-time database systems associate the concept of deadlines with transaction executions.Previous approaches use" best effort" techniques to schedule a given set of transactions tomeet the deadlines as well as to ensure the consistency of the database. However; suchapproaches are inadequate for target applications which have" hard" real-time deadlinesthat need to be met in the event of crisis situations. In such cases; it is important to obtaincontingency plans that may be invoked with guaranteed execution time characteristics. Thispaper presents an alternative model for real-time database systems in which deadlines areassociated with" contingency" constraints rather than directly with transactions. Ourapproach leads to a predicate-based model that intrinsically incorporates both triggeringand relative timing constraints regarding the transaction executions.

Methods are programs written in acomputationally complete programming language. This gives the object-oriented model anexpressive power that is significantly greater than the relational algebra. This power; thoughdesirable in many applications; places severe restrictions on the potential for theoptimization of object-oriented queries: The encapsulation of methods within objects makesit difficult to do globM query optimization. The richness of the language used for definingmethods causes optimization problems that are decidable for relational algebra expressionsto be undeeidable for methods.

Our approach in this paper is to identifyways in which a commit protocol can be made adaptive in the sense that under situationsthat demand it; such as a transient local overload; the system can dynamically change to adifferent commitment strategy. The decision to do so can be taken autonomously at any site.The different commitment strategies exploit a trade-off between the cost of commitment andthe obtained degree of atomicity.

Rather than restricting attention to read- andwrite-modes; we consider modes to correspond to the privilege to perform particular databaseoperations. We construct the lock mode compatibility matrix from the properties of the operationsassociated with the lock modes.

Maintaining Database Consistency in Heterogeneous Distributed DatabaseSystems,Sharad Mehrotra; Rajeev Rastogi; Henry F Korth; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract The concept of serializability has been the traditionally accepted notion ofcorrectness in database systems. However; in a heterogeneous distributed database system(HDBMS) environment; ensuring serializability is a difficult task mainly due to the desire ofpreserving the various participating local database systems. In this paper; we introduce anew correctness criterion for HDBMSs; two level serializability (2LSR). We identifyrestrictions under which 2LSR schedules preserve database consistency. Further; wepresent a simple protocol for ensuring schedules are 2LSR. This protocol is easilyimplementable and does not violate the local autonomy of sites.,*,1991,11

Overcoming heterogeneity and autonomy in multidatabase systems,Sharad Mehrotra; Rajeev Rastogi; Yuri Breitbart; Henry F Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,Abstract A multidatabase system (MDBS) is a software system for integration of preexistingand independent local database management systems (DBMSs). The transactionmanagement problem in MDBSs consists of designing appropriate software; on top of localDBMSs; such that users can execute transactions that span multiple local DBMSs withoutjeopardizing database consistency. The difficulty in transaction management in MDBSsarises due to the heterogeneity of the transaction management algorithms used by the localDBMSs; and the desire to preserve their local autonomy. In this paper; we develop aframework for designing fault-tolerant transaction management algorithms for MDBSenvironments that effectively overcomes the heterogeneity-and autonomy-inducedproblems.

Schema versions and DAG rearrangement views in object-oriented databases,Hyoung-Joo Kim; Henry F Korth,ABSTRACT An important requirement of non-traditional database applications such ascomputer aided design; artificial intelligence; and office information systems with multimediadocuments is the support of application evolution. Application evolution includes evolution ofobject schémas as well as evolution of objects in the application. We provided a frameworkof schema evolution in [BKKK86; ВККЖ87] and the framework was realized in an object-oriented database system; ORION; at MCC. In this paper; we extend this schema evolutionframework by allowing schema versions and DÂG rearrangement views in object-orienteddatabases. We present a technique that enables users to manipulate schema versionsexplicitly and maintain schema evolution histories. For completeness; we integrate ourmodel with the object version model formulated by II. T. Chou and W. Kim [CK86]. We …,*,1988,8

A framework for understanding distributed (deadlock detection) algorithms,Henry F Korth; Ravi Krishnamurthy; Anil Nigam; John T Robinson,Abstract Distributed algorithms tend to be difficult to understand and even more difficult toprove correct. Using distributed dead-lock detection as a running example this paperpresents a framework for stating; understanding; and proving the correctness of distributedalgorithms for decision problems. The framework consists of a series of complexity levels. Tosimplify the initial levels; we treat the data structure of the algorithm as a database; and usethe database notions of views and transaction atomicity. For each complexity level; we statetheorems that need to be proved for each algorithm. The framework is illustrated usingseveral existing deadlock detection algorithms. Finally; it is shown that the frameworksuggests new algorithms using the best features of several existing algorithms.,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD symposium on Principles of database systems,1983,8

Transcending the serializability requirement,Rajeev Rastogi; Sharad Mehrotra; Henry F.  Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,The concept of serializability as the notion of correctness for certain\new" databaseapplications or in certain distributed database environments has been recently shown tohave unacceptable practical consequences. For example; in applications such as computer-aided design; where transactions are of a long duration; adopting the serializabilitycorrectness criterion may result in long-duration waits imposed by locking protocols 4]. Inmultidatabase systems (MDBS); which is an integration of a number of autonomous localdatabase management systems (DBMSs); ensuring serializability may result in a low degreeof concurrency and; depending upon the interface exported by the local DBMSs; may noteven be achievable without the loss of local autonomy. In this paper; we propose twocomplementary approaches for relaxing the serializability requirement. The rst approach …,Data Engineering Bulletin,1993,6

Edge locks and deadlock avoidance in distributed systems,Henry F Korth,Abstract Two locking protocols are defined for distributed database systems. One protocolprovides deadlock avoidance without the need to roll back transactions. The other allows auseful weakening of the protocol in which only a limited class of easily handled deadlocksmay occur. The protocols are capable of handling replicated as well as partitioned data. Likethe centralized protocol on which they are based; the protocol of this paper permits lockingat multiple granularities and allows collections of locks to be constructed to correspond to anarbitrary collection of database operations. Special provisions are made in the protocol toallow readers; and in particular; readers that touch data at only one site; to execute with lesslocking overhead than writers. Following the description of the protocol; comparisons aremade between the protocol of this paper and other protocols previously published that …,Proceedings of the first ACM SIGACT-SIGOPS symposium on Principles of distributed computing,1982,6

Efficient global transaction management in multidatabase systems,Sharad Mehrotra; Rajeev Rastogi; Yuri Breitbart; Henry F Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,Abstract Concurrency control schemes for ensuring global serial-izability in a multidatabasesystem (MDBS) environment are complicated due to the autonomy of local databasemanagement systems (DBMSs). In this paper; we develop concurrency control schemes; forthe MDBS environment; that are simple; permit a high degree of concurrency and incurminimal overhead under two different assumptions on the nature of schedules produced bythe local DBMSs:(1) each local DBMS produces rigorous schedules;(2) each local DBMSproduces strongly recoverable schedules. Our interest in rigorous schedules stems from thefact that the majority of commercial DBMSs offer a concurrency control protocol thatgenerates rigorous schedules. However; the class of rigorous schedules is quite restrictivein terms of the amount of concurrency permitted. We; therefore; also consider the class of …,Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications (DASFAA),1993,3
An architecture for large multidatabase systems,Sharad Mehrotra; Henry F Korth; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract Over the past decade; substantial research has been done towards developingtransaction management algorithms for multidatabase systems. Most of these research eorts have concentrated on the problems that arise due to the heterogeneity and theautonomy of the various local databases that are integrated into a multidatabaseenvironment. One issue that has been relatively ignored is that of the architecture ofmultidatabase systems. We believe that a large multidatabase system spanning multipleorganizations that are distributed over various geographically distant locations will not bedeveloped as a single monolithic system. Rather; it will be developed hierarchically. As aresult; the transaction management algorithms followed by a multidatabase system must becomposable in such a way that it is feasible to incorporate individual multidatabase …,*,1993,3
Serializability among autonomous transaction managers,Nandit Soparkar; Henry F Korth; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract Ensuring the serializability of transaction executions in an environment consisting ofseveral autonomous sites is a current research effort. While several ad hoc schemes havebeen proposed that are sufficient to ensure serializability; it is not clear what conditions arenecessary. We explore this question in an attempt to delineate those classes of concurrencycontrol protocols that exist at local sites that may be integrated. Our research indicates theexisting or future protocols that are amenable to integration; and also suggests the means todo so. We provide a characterization for integrating the transaction schedules fromautonomous sites in a manner similar to that used in centralized concurrency control.,*,1992,3

Mostexisting research deals with the performance evaluation aspect of deadline-basedtransaction executions using ad hoc heuristics. This paper presents a model on which tobase the scheduling and correctness criteria for time-constrained transaction managementin a centralized computing environment.

Wepresent some of our research results for scheduling; and discuss several relevant issuesregarding the domain of time-constrained transaction management. 3 Work supported by …,*,1992,3
Techniques for failure-resilient transaction management in multidatabases,Nandit Soparkar; Henry F Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,Abstract The ensuring of correct transaction executions in practical multidatabase systems isa difficult problem; since few changes are permissible in the constituent local databasesystems to accommodate the demands of the distributed environment. In this paper; weshow that the preservation of two aspects of local autonomy-the degrees of control over thetransactions by the sites (execution autonomy); and the multidatabase system (controlautonomy)-has implications with regard to the correct executions of transactions in amultidatabase system that is susceptible to failures. The relationship between the localautonomy and achieving correct executions sheds some light on the reasons behind someof the difficulties that have been encountered in previous research.

Typically; mechanisms are provided as part of thetransaction management system to relieve the application designers of managingconcurrent executions and unexpected failures. Additionally; providing adequate real-timeresponsiveness in such systems necessitates the distributed autonomous management ofthe transaction executions—due to the reason that a centralized approach would beinefficient and highly sensitive to the failure of a single site. Ensuring the logical correctnessof concurrent transaction executions in terms of maintaining serializability in an environmentconsisting of several autonomous sites is a current research effort.

Strict Histories in Object-Based Database,Rajeev Rastogi; Henry F Korth; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract In order to ensure the simplicity of recovery in an object-based database systemenvironment; the notion of a strict history containing operations that are semantically richerthan read and write operations is of vital importance. A strict history is one in which recoveryfor aborted operations can be performed by simply executing their inverse operations. In thispaper; we develop concurrency control schemes based on commutativity betweenoperations and inverses of operations for efficiently ensuring that histories are strict. Weshow that in schemes based on commutativity; the time complexity for scheduling anoperation for execution is linear in the number of operations that have neither committed noraborted in the history. We also utilize the weakest precondition of operations in order to statenecessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring that scheduling an operation for …,*,1992,1
Transaction Management for Distributed Multidatabases,Nandit Soparkar; Henry F Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,Abstract Correctly managing transaction executions in a system of autonomous databases isa difficult problem.

This paper proposes a newparadigm for transaction management for failure-prone environments with minimal changesmade to the existing systems. The development process for the scheme is simple; a largevariety of concurrency control schemes may be handled; and the approach is able to toleratefailures of both sites and the communication system. Also; ways are proposed to profitablyuse new communications technology; and to use the existing storage and retrieval facilitiesso as to reduce the costs of the integration. 3 This material is based in part upon worksupported by the Texas Advanced Research Program under Grant No. 4355 and by the …,*,1992,1
An Optimistic Commit Protocol for Distributed Transaction Management,Henry F Korth; Eliezer Levy; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract A major disadvantage of the two-phase commit (2PC) protocol is the potentialunbounded delay that transactions may have to endure if certain failures occur. Bycombining a novel use of compensating transactions along with an optimistic assumption;we propose a revised 2PC protocol that overcomes these difficulties. In the revised protocol;locks are released when a site votes to commit a transaction; thereby solving the indefiniteblocking problem of 2PC. Semantic; rather than standard; atomicity is guaranteed as theeffects of a transaction that is finally aborted are undone semantically by a compensatingtransaction. Relaxing standard atomicity interacts in a subtle way with correctness andconcurrency control issues. Accordingly; a correctness criterion is proposed that is mostappropriate when atomicity is given up for semantic atomicity. The correctness criterion …,*,1990,1

Evaluation of pipelined hash-join operations on uniform heterogeneous multithreaded architectures,Philip Garcia; Henry F Korth,Abstract Multi-core and multithreaded processors have reached the mainstream market; andpresent both opportunities and challenges in the design of query processing algorithms.This paper studies the processing of a pipeline of hash-join operations; building upon priorwork that focused on a single operation. It shows that it is necessary to have more threadsavailable in the algorithm than the processor itself can actually run concurrently in order toachieve optimal performance. It also describes a buffer-management scheme that limitscache conflicts among threads. Experimental results show the relative merits of passingpointers to intermediate results versus full materialization. Finally; the paper discusses howto extrapolate from its results to future architectures with a larger number of cores andconcurrent threads.,*,2006,*

Information; Communication; and Money: For What Can We Charge and How Can We Meter It?,Stephen Blott; Henry F Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,Internet telephony; electronic commerce; on-line information services; and videoconferencing are projected to grow rapidly in coming years. How can we charge for theseand similar services? What information must be gathered to enable proper billing forservices rendered? Where is this information generated and where is it collected? Thesequestions are being addressed in today's marketplace in an ad-hoc manner. Since this is inessence a distributed information system problem; the database research community shouldbe able to have a positive influence on the evolution of billing systems for electroniccommunication and information services. Billing systems represent a significant and growingdatabase problem.

A Historical Perspective,Henry F Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,It is routine to nd accounts in the popular press and news media of the\informationexplosion." This term; though imprecise; refers not only to the increase in the amount ofinformation available in digital form; but also to the phenomenal growth in the breadth ofinformation dissemination. This information explosion is often credited in large part to thecombination of 1. low-cost computing and storage devices that are now not only in businesspremises; but also in private homes; 2. low-cost internet access that potentially allows all thecomputing and storage devices to be connected (even when they are mobile); 3. theavailability of simple; easy-to-use interfaces (eg; web browsers).,*,1996,*
Centralized Scheduling,Nandit R Soparkar; Henry F Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,Abstract We consider the question of scheduling time-constrained transactions in thischapter. It is assumed that the necessary triggering associated with the invocation of thetransactions is achieved by other processes. The emphasis is on centralized scheduling (ie;there is one concurrency control module). First; we consider the criteria for performance ingreater detail. Second; the inadequacies in traditional scheduling techniques used inexisting concurrency control implementations in terms of meeting various performancecriteria are examined. Third; we study the futility of achieving the best possible schedules.Fourth; we present some mechanisms that may be used to achieve good scheduling inplace of the unattainable best. Finally; we consider how the issue of imprecise timingconsiderations may be addressed; and also; how better predictions assist in achieving …,*,1996,*
Distributed Scheduling,Nandit R Soparkar; Henry F Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,Abstract In this chapter; we deal with the issues of scheduling transactions in a distributedTCTM environment (eg; see [SKS93; SKS95a]) for our model described earlier. 1 Weexamine the question of ensuring globally serializable schedules; and exhibit the limitationsinherently present in achieving such synchronization. Also; we consider the question ofachieving a non-blocking GAC protocol which is an important consideration for meeting thedeadline constraints on the global transactions. Instead of discussing specific protocols; theapproach taken is to deal with the fundamental limitations that will be faced by any protocol.Specific protocols can be easily generated; and several exist in the literature (eg; see[BHG87]). A synchronization protocol (which ensures ensure global serializability) could bedistinct as compared to a GAC protocol (which ensures atomic executions). In traditional …,*,1996,*
Semantics in Scheduling,Nandit R Soparkar; Henry F Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,Abstract As discussed earlier; meeting traditional atomicity requirements in the presence ofdeadline constraints on global transactions is problematic. Moreover; the unpredictability;the cost; and the fault-tolerance properties of the 2PC protocol; which is used in traditionaldistributed DBMSs; render it undesirable for TCTM applications. In this chapter; we presentalternative approaches (eg; see [SLKS94; SS90a]) to address the issue of maintainingatomicity in distributed TCTM systems. 1,*,1996,*
A Model,Nandit R Soparkar; Henry F Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,Abstract We describe a framework within which most of our discussions for TCTM will bebased. 1 The intent is not so much to describe a model as to provide the basis for describingthe research. Therefore; we have chosen to adopt a general model for transactions andschedules that we suitably modify for our purposes. Similar other models could well havebeen used. In this chapter; we concentrate on the frameworks for centralized and distributedenvironments. Since the area is relatively new; and the problems are ill-understood; thecareful description of the model is justified. However; note that the model is more generalthan the scope of our work; not all the features described are investigated in detail.,*,1996,*

Interoperability with unstructured data and services,Daniel Barbara; Yuri Breitbart; Hector Garcia-Molina; Henry F.  Korth; Sharad Mehrotra,A large percentage of valuable information is not stored in database management systems.Therefore; many applications must deal only only with heterogeneous structured data; butwith a wide variety of unstructured and semi-structured data such as electronic mail;documents; files and spreadsheets. In addition; these applications must deal withheterogeneous services such as an electronic library or an airline reservation service. Whileit is; of course; important to study interoperability among heterogeneous conventionaldatabase systems; it is also very important to study interoperation in this broader domain;where application programs must interact with a wide variety of services and must handlemany types of structures; unstructured; and semi-structured data.,Research Issues in Data Engineering; 1993: Interoperability in Multidatabase Systems; 1993.

Intra-Transaction Concurrency Control and the NT/PV Model,Henry F Korth; Gregory D Speegle,Abstract In nested transactions systems; it is possible for each level of a transaction to haveits own correctness criteria. This results in a complex; multilevel concurrency controlproblem. We propose an approach to this problem called the intra-transaction concurrencycontrol paradigm for handling multilevel concurrency control applications. This paradigm isbased on defining a restricted scope for the concurrency control protocols used at each levelof nesting. As such; the process of deriving multilevel protocols is simplified. To demonstratethis; two example protocols; one for the class conflict serializability (CSR) and one for theclass conflict predicate correct (CFC)[KS88] are presented.,*,1990,*

PSYCHO: A Graphical Language for Supporting Schema Evolution in Object-oriented Databases,Hyoung-Joo Kim; Henry F Korth,ABSTRACT One of the important requirements of non-conventional applications such asCAD/CAM; AI; and OIS (office information systems) with multimedia documents is schemaevolution; that is; the ability to make a wide variety of changes to the database schemadynamically. We provided a framework of schema evolution in [BKKK86; BKKK87] and theframework was realized in an objectoriented database system; ORION at MCC. S chemamodifications using line-oriented interaction are difficult for the user to manage if classlattices are complicated. The difficulty is even greater because there are a large number oftypes of schema modifications. We have designed and implemented a powerful; yet user-friendly graphical interface PSYCHO (Pictorial Schema-editor Yielding Class Hierarchiesand Objects) for supporting schema modification in object-oriented databases.

ROSI: A User-friendly Operating System Interface Based on the Relational Data Model,Henry F Korth; Abraham Silberschatz,File management is one of the most visible services of an operating system. A ﬁle is acollection of related information deﬁned by its creator. Commonly; ﬁles represent programs(both source and object forms) and data. Data ﬁles may be numeric; alphabetic oralphanumeric. Files may be free-form; such as text ﬁles; or may be rigidly formatted. Ingeneral; a ﬁle is a sequence of bits; bytes; lines or records Whose meaning is deﬁned by itscreator and user. Computers can store information in several diﬁerent physical forms;magnetic tape; disk; and drum are the most common forms. Each of these devices has itsown characteris~ tics and physical organization. For convenient use of the computer system;the operating system provides a uniform logical view of information storage.

Relaxing Serializability in Multidatabase Systems,Henry F Korth,Abstract The concept of serializability has been traditionally accepted as the standard notionof correctness in database systems. However; in a muliidatabase system (MDBS); ensuringserializability is a difficult task mainly due to the desire of preserving the autonomy of theparticipating local database systems. In this pa-per; we introduce a new notion ofcorrectness; RS-correctness; that is based on preserving the integrity constraints of thedatabase. We present a new protocol for ensuring that schedules in an MDBS environmentare RS-correct. The protocol preserves the local autonomy of sites.,*,*,*

A viable model of CAD transactionmust allow a group of cooperating designers to arrive at a design without being forced towait over a long duration. It must also allow a group of designers to collaborate on a designwith another group by assigning subtasks. In this paper; we provide both an intuitivedescription and a formal development of a new model of CAD transactions.,*,*,*

SIGMOD 2003 Demo Proposal: Relational On-Line Exchange with XML,Philip Bohannon; Xin Luna Dong; Sumit Ganguly; Henry F Korth; Chengkai Li; PPS Narayan; Pradeep Shenoy,As XML has gained widespread popularity; new applications are often XML-based; that is;they depend primarily on XML documents and the associated data model for data accessand messaging. However; in most cases the XML-based application must interoperate withexisting SQL-based applications. In the typical “shred-and-publish” approach tointeroperation; incoming XML data is parsed (shredded) into relational tables and outgoingdata is extracted by SQL engines and then formatted (published) as XML. For example; adatabase supporting an SQL-based hotel-reservation application may also be called on tosupport a web-site; or to exchange XML with a third party “hub” for the travel industry.Maintaining the mapping between the relational data source and the associated XMLdocuments is complex and error-prone. Fortunately; recently-developed middleware …,*,*,*
