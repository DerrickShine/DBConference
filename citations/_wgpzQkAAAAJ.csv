Nanosensors based on plasmonics are promising devices in this regard; in thatthey combine the features of high sensitivity; label-free detection and miniaturization.However; plasmonic-based nanosensors; in common with general sensors with sensitiveareas on the scale of nanometres; cannot be used directly to detect molecules dissolved infemto-or attomolar solutions. In other words; they are diffusion-limited and their detectiontimes become impractical at such concentrations. In this Article; we demonstrate; bycombining super-hydrophobic artificial surfaces and nanoplasmonic structures; that fewmolecules can be localized and detected even at attomolar (10− 18 mol l− 1) …,Nature Photonics,2011,364
Natural tri-to hexapeptides self-assemble in water to amyloid β-type fiber aggregates by unexpected α-helical intermediate structures,Charlotte AE Hauser; Rensheng Deng; Archana Mishra; Yihua Loo; Ulung Khoe; Furen Zhuang; Daniel W Cheong; Angelo Accardo; Michael B Sullivan; Christian Riekel; Jackie Y Ying; Ulrich A Hauser,Abstract Many fatal neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's; Parkinson; the prion-related diseases; and non-neurodegenerative disorders such as type II diabetes arecharacterized by abnormal amyloid fiber aggregates; suggesting a common mechanism ofpathogenesis. We have discovered that a class of systematically designed natural tri-tohexapeptides with a characteristic sequential motif can simulate the process of fiberassembly and further condensation to amyloid fibrils; probably via unexpected dimeric α-helical intermediate structures. The characteristic sequence motif of the novel peptide classconsists of an aliphatic amino acid tail of decreasing hydrophobicity capped by a polar head.To our knowledge; the investigated aliphatic tripeptides are the shortest ever reportednaturally occurring amino acid sequence that can adopt α-helical structure and promote …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2011,133
Aliphatic peptides show similar self-assembly to amyloid core sequences; challenging the importance of aromatic interactions in amyloidosis,Anupama Lakshmanan; Daniel W Cheong; Angelo Accardo; Enzo Di Fabrizio; Christian Riekel; Charlotte AE Hauser,Abstract The self-assembly of abnormally folded proteins into amyloid fibrils is a hallmark ofmany debilitating diseases; from Alzheimer's and Parkinson diseases to prion-relateddisorders and diabetes type II. However; the fundamental mechanism of amyloidaggregation remains poorly understood. Core sequences of four to seven amino acidswithin natural amyloid proteins that form toxic fibrils have been used to studyamyloidogenesis. We recently reported a class of systematically designed ultrasmallpeptides that self-assemble in water into cross-β–type fibers. Here we compare the self-assembly of these peptides with natural core sequences. These include core segments fromAlzheimer's amyloid-β; human amylin; and calcitonin.

Fractal structure can explain the increased hydrophobicity of nanoporous silicon films,F Gentile; E Battista; A Accardo; ML Coluccio; M Asande; G Perozziello; G Das; C Liberale; F De Angelis; P Candeloro; P Decuzzi; E Di Fabrizio,Abstract Nano porous silicon (NPSi) films were fabricated via a process of Si anodicdissolution. An apparent contact angle as large as 140° was measured. Atomic forcemicroscopy (AFM) was used for deriving the surface roughness profile and imaging thetopography of the porous layer. A power spectrum was conveniently derived and used todeconvolute the fractal dimension of the surface as D f∼ 2.8; thus strictly larger than thetopological or Euclidean dimension D= 2. Due to its fractal nature; the NPSi surface wouldbe self affine; thus containing details at arbitrarily small scales. The apparent contact anglewas accordingly derived in terms of a recursive function wherewith hydrophobicity increaseswith the scale factor n. The right size of the problem (that is; the degree to which one shouldenlarge the system to gain sufficient insight of the problem) would strictly depend upon …,Microelectronic Engineering,2011,31

The drops were deposited on a nanopatternedsuperhydrophobic poly (methyl methacrylate) surface and raster-scanned duringevaporation by small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering. The appearance of about 200-nm-size calcite crystallites at the interface could be spatially resolved at the onset ofcrystallization. Diffuse scattering from the interface is attributed to a dense nanoscaleamorphous calcium carbonate phase.

Amyloid β peptide conformational changes in the presence of a lipid membrane system,Angelo Accardo; Victoria Shalabaeva; Marine Cotte; Manfred Burghammer; Roman Krahne; Christian Riekel; Silvia Dante,Here we are presenting a comparative analysis of conformational changes of two amyloid βpeptides; Aβ (25–35) and Aβ (1–42); in the presence and absence of a phospholipid system;namely; POPC/POPS (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphospatidylcholine/palmitoyl-2-oleoylphospatidylserine); through Raman spectroscopy; synchrotron radiation micro Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy; and micro X-ray diffraction. Ringlike samples were obtainedfrom the evaporation of pure and mixed solutions of the proteins together with thePOPC/POPS system on highly hydrophilic substrates. The results confirm the presence of aα-helical to β-sheet transition from the internal rim of the ringlike samples to the external onein the pure Aβ (25–35) residual; probably due to the convective flow inside the dropletssitting on highly hydrophilic substrates enhancing the local concentration of the peptide at …,Langmuir,2014,22

The morphology of the metallicnanostructures must be tailored according to the chosen application; for example; metal nanoparticlescan be well suited for SERS analysis while metallic thin films can be more suitable for solarharvesting. Morphology can also be tuned for enhancing the photo–chemi–electric propertiesof the nanostructures. For example; the catalytic performance strongly depends on the exposedarea of the metallic nanostructure; while its photonic properties greatly depend on the resonanceconditions which; in turn; are related to the geometrical characteristics of the …,*,2014,*

The most important transport quantityin the typically steady; laminar; and incompressible flows in these applications is thevelocity. The energy required to drive an aqueous solution through nanochannels andmicrochannels; for example; is determined by the velocity gradient at the channel wall; usuallycalcu- lated by differentiating the velocity field. Measuring this velocity field requires techniqueswith a spatial resolution at least an order of magnitude less than the overall dimension of thenanochannel or microchannel. The leading microfluidic velocimetry technique; micro-particleimage velocimetry (mPIV); measures fluid velocity distributions by following the motion of suspendedfluorescent polystyrene (PS) particles less than 3 mm in diameter [1; 2]. Because PS has …,Encyclopedia of Nanotechnology,2012,*
