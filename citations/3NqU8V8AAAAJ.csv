Query-based why-not provenance with nedexplain,Nicole Bidoit; Melanie Herschel; Katerina Tzompanaki,With the increasing amount of available data and transformations manipulating the data; ithas become essential to analyze and debug data transformations. A sub-problem of datatransformation analysis is to understand why some data are not part of the result of arelational query. One possibility to explain the lack of data in a query result is to identifywhere in the query we lost data pertinent to the expected outcome. A first approach to this socalled why-not provenance has been recently proposed; but we show that this first approachhas some shortcomings. To overcome these shortcomings; we propose\ned; an algorithm toexplain data missing from a query result. NedExplain computes the why-not provenance formonotone relational queries with aggregation. After providing necessary definitions; thispaper contributes a detailed description of the algorithm. A comparative evaluation shows …,Extending Database Technology (EDBT),2014,40
A Repository for 3D Model Production and Interpretation in Culture and Beyond.,Martin Doerr; Katerina Tzompanaki; Maria Theodoridou; Christos Georgis; Anastasia Axaridou; Sven Havemann,Abstract In order to support the work of researchers in the production; processing andinterpretation of complex digital objects and the dissemination of valuable and diverseinformation to a broad spectrum of audience there is need for an integrated highperformance environment that will combine knowledge base features with contentmanagement and information retrieval (IR) technologies. In this paper we describe thedesign and implementation of an integrated repository to ingest; store; manipulate; andexport 3D Models; their related digital objects and metadata and to enable efficient access;use; reuse and preservation of the information; ensuring referential and semantic integrity.The repository design is based on an integrated coherent conceptual schema that modelscomplex metadata regarding provenance information; structured models; formats …,VAST,2010,35
EFQ: why-not answer polynomials in action,Nicole Bidoit; Melanie Herschel; Katerina Tzompanaki,Abstract One important issue in modern database applications is supporting the user withefficient tools to debug and fix queries because such tasks are both time and skilldemanding. One particular problem is known as Why-Not question and focusses on thereasons for missing tuples from query results. The EFQ platform demonstrated here hasbeen designed in this context to efficiently leverage Why-Not Answers polynomials; a novelapproach that provides the user with complete explanations to Why-Not questions andallows for automatic; relevant query refinements.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,15
Immutably Answering Why-Not Questions for Equivalent Conjunctive Queries.,Nicole Bidoit; Melanie Herschel; Katerina Tzompanaki,Abstract Answering Why-Not questions consists in explaining to developers of complex datatransformations or manipulations why their data transformation did not produce somespecific results; although they expected them to do so. Different types of explanations thatserve as Why-Not answers have been proposed in the past and are either based on theavailable data; the query tree; or both. Solutions (partially) based on the query tree aregenerally more efficient and easier to interpret by developers than solutions solely based ondata. However; algorithms producing such query-based explanations so far may returndifferent results for reordered conjunctive query trees; and even worse; these results may beincomplete. Clearly; this represents a significant usability problem; as the explanationsdevelopers get may be partial and developers have to worry about the query tree …,TaPP,2014,15
Efficient Computation of Polynomial Explanations of Why-Not Questions,Nicole Bidoit; Melanie Herschel; Aikaterini Tzompanaki,Abstract Answering a Why-Not question consists in explaining why a query result does notcontain some expected data; called missing answers. This paper focuses on processingWhy-Not questions in a query-based approach that identifies the culprit query components.Our first contribution is a general definition of a Why-Not explanation by means of apolynomial. Intuitively; the polynomial provides all possible explanations to explore in orderto recover the missing answers; together with an estimation of the number of recoverableanswers. Moreover; this formalism allows us to represent Why-Not explanations in a unifiedway for extended relational models with probabilistic or bag semantics. We further presentan algorithm to efficiently compute the polynomial for a given Why-Not question. Anexperimental evaluation demonstrates the practicality of the solution both in terms of …,International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM),2015,14
A new framework for querying semantic networks,Katerina Tzompanaki; Martin Doerr,Abstract The upcoming large-scale metadata repositories; semantic networks of RDF triplesintegrating large amounts of cultural–historical data; are not easily accessible to globalquery paradigms; such as “query by example” or keyword search. ISO21127 (CIDOCConceptual Reference Model) is an adequate global schema for such systems; but queryingindividually hundreds of different kinds of properties leaves a huge recall gap compared totext retrieval; whereas a global restriction to “core metadata;” such as Dublin Core; deprivesthe systems of any more advanced integration and reasoning capability. We thereforepropose and have implemented a new query paradigm: Intuitive “fundamental” categoriesand relationships; as we are used to from core metadata; are presented to the user ascomplex deductions from a rich underlying network of more specialized actual metadata …,Proceedings of Museums and the Web 2012: the international conference for culture and heritage on-line,2012,14
A Distributed Object Repository for Cultural Heritage.,Xueming Pan; Philipp Beckmann; Sven Havemann; Katerina Tzompanaki; Martin Doerr; Dieter W Fellner,Abstract This paper describes the design and the implementation of a distributed objectrepository that offers cultural heritage experts and practitioners a working platform to access;use; share and modify digital content. The principle of collecting paradata to document eachstep in a potentially long sequence of processing steps implies a number of designdecisions for the data repository; which are described and explained. Furthermore; weprovide a description of the concise API our implementation. Our intention is to provide aneasy-to-understand recipe that may be valuable also for other data repositoryimplementations that incorporate and operationalize the more theoretical concepts ofintellectual transparency; collecting paradata; and compatibility to semantic networks.,VAST,2010,12
Fundamental Categories and Relationships for intuitive querying CIDOC-CRM based repositories,Katerina Tzompanaki; Martin Doerr,Abstract The upcoming large-scale metadata repositories; semantic networks of RDF triplesintegrating large amounts of cultural–historical data need a rich schema upon which to buildtheir metadata. ISO21127 (CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model) is an adequate globalschema for such systems; providing the depth of classification needed to describe andintegrate the information. But then raises the information access problem as queryingindividually hundreds of different kinds of properties leaves a huge recall gap and on theother side traditional querying techniques such as the keyword search is not adequate. Onthe other hand; a global restriction to “core metadata;” such as Dublin Core; deprives thesystems of any more advanced integration and reasoning capability.

Reasoning based on property propagation on CIDOC-CRM and CRMdig based repositories,Katerina Tzompanaki; Martin Doerr; Maria Theodoridou; Irini Fundulaki,Abstract. Reasoning on provenance information and property propagation is of significantimportance in e-science since it helps scientists manage derived metadata in order tounderstand the source of an object; reproduce results of processes and facilitate qualitycontrol of results and processes. In this paper we introduce a simple; yet powerful reasoningmechanism based on property propagation along the transitive part-of and derivationchains; in order to trace the provenance of an object and to carry useful inferences. Weapply our reasoning in semantic repositories using the CIDOC-CRM conceptual schemaand its extension CRMdig; which has been develop for representing the digital andempirical provenance of digital objects.,A Mapping of CIDOC CRM Events to German Wordnet for Event Detection in Texts,2013,5
Semi-automatic SQL debugging and fixing to solve the missing-answers problem,Katerina Tzompanaki,Asking questions is the driving force for scientific progress. But as important as it is to askquestions; so important is to be able to understand the obtained answers. In this way; we areable to verify the sanity of the question itself and if necessary refine it. In the same spirit; inthis PhD we focus on SQL queries over re-lational databases with the aim to (1) pinpoint thereasons on the SQL query that led to missing-answers (tuples that were expected but notobtained in the query result);(2) fix the SQL query so that it best fits the user's expectations;and (3) do both efficiently so as to be of practical use.,Very Large Databases (VLDB'14) PhD Workshop,2014,2
A mapping of CIDOC CRM events to German Wordnet for event detection in texts,Martin Scholz,A number of data models; while not CRM-compliant; have been influenced by the CRM; egthe Europeana Data Model. At the same time; some people claim that the examples ofpractical working systems using CRM are few and far between. There are various difficultiesfacing wider CRM adoption and interoperation; eg:,17th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries (TPDL 2013),2013,2
Refining SQL Queries based on Why-Not Polynomials,Nicole Bidoit; Melanie Herschel; Katerina Tzompanaki,*,8th USENIX Workshop on the Theory and Practice of Provenance (TaPP 16),2016,1
Efficiently and Effectively Answering Why-Not Questions based on Provenance Polynomials,Nicole Bidoit; Melanie Herschel; Katerina Tzompanaki,The problem of answering Why-Not questions consists in explaining why the result of aquery does not contain some expected data; ie; missing answers. To solve this problem; weresort to identifying where in the query; data relevant to the missing answer were lost.Existing algorithms producing such query-based explanations rely on a query treerepresentation; potentially leading to different or partial explanations. This significantlyimpairs on the effectiveness of computed explanations. Here we present an effective; query-tree independent representation of query-based explanations; for a wide class of Why-Notquestions; based on provenance polynomials. We further describe an algorithm thatefficiently computes the complete set of these explanations. An experimental evaluationvalidates our statements,*,2015,1

Visualizing the addition of missing words to regular expressions,Thomas Rebele; Katerina Tzompanaki; Fabian Suchanek,Abstract. Regular expressions are used in many information extraction systems like YAGO;DBpedia; Gate and SystemT. However; they sometimes do not match what their creatorwanted to find. We investigate how missing words can be added automatically to a regularexpression by creating disjunctions at the appropriate positions. Our demo visualizes thesteps that our algorithm employs to repair the regular expression.,International Semantic Web Conference,2017,*
connect with us,Nicole Bidoit; Melanie Herschel; Katerina Tzompanaki,Abstract: Explaining why some data are not part of a query result has recently gainedsignificant interest. One use of why-not explanations is adapting queries to meet userexpectations. We propose an algorithm to automatically generate changes to a query; byusing Why-Not polynomials; one form of why-not explanations based on query operators.We improve on the state of the art in three aspects:(i) we refine both selection and joinpredicates;(ii) we guarantee a maximum similarity to the original query; and (iii) we cover allpossible cases of why the desired data was missing. A prototype implementation shows theapplicability of our approach in practice.,*,2016,*
Réponses manquantes: Débogage et Réparation de requêtes,Aikaterini Tzompanaki,La quantité croissante des données s' accompagne par l'augmentation du nombre deprogrammes de transformation de données; généralement des requêtes; et par la nécessitéd'analyser et comprendre leurs résultats:(a) pourquoi telle réponse figure dans le résultat?ou (b) pourquoi telle information n'y figure pas? La première question demande de trouverl'origine ou la provenance des résultats dans la base; un problème très étudié depuis une20taine d'années. Par contre; expliquer l'absence de réponses dans le résultat d'unerequête est un problème peu exploré jusqu'à présent. Répondre à une question Pourquoi-Pas consiste à fournir des explications quant à l'absence de réponses.
