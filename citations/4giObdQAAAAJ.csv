Design and characterization of a full-duplex multiantenna system for WiFi networks,Melissa Duarte; Ashutosh Sabharwal; Vaneet Aggarwal; Rittwik Jana; KK Ramakrishnan; Christopher W Rice; NK Shankaranarayanan,In this paper; we present an experiment-and simulation-based study to evaluate the use offull duplex (FD) as a potential mode in practical IEEE 802.11 networks. To enable the study;we designed a 20-MHz multiantenna orthogonal frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) FDphysical layer and an FD media access control (MAC) protocol; which is backwardcompatible with current 802.11. Our extensive over-the-air experiments; simulations; andanalysis demonstrate the following two results. First; the use of multiple antennas at thephysical layer leads to a higher ergodic throughput than its hardware-equivalentmultiantenna half-duplex (HD) counterparts for SNRs above the median SNR encounteredin practical WiFi deployments. Second; the proposed MAC translates the physical layer rategain into near doubling of throughput for multinode single-AP networks. The two results …,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2014,359

Enterprise mobile server platform,*,As is known in the art; wireless Internet access is different from simply accessing the Internetwirelessly. Mobile wireless users have different needs; motivations and capabilities from typicalwireline users. For example; a mobile user is usually in a multi-tasking mode; eg; accessing theInternet while attending a meeting or shopping in the mall. Typical Internet accesses are burstyin nature (checking stock quotes; weather; or finding a nearby restaurant) and task-oriented.Thus; browser-centric applications and elaborate user interfaces are of limited utility since a mobileuser usually carries small devices such as a cell phone or a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA)having relatively small displays. These personalized devices; which are typically identified bya wireless network address such as a cellular phone number; provide mobile users with continuousaccess to the Internet … Advances in wireless networking and messaging technologies …,*,2003,259

Voice communications over zigbee networks,Chonggang Wang; Kazem Sohraby; Rittwik Jana; Lusheng Ji; Mahmoud Daneshmand,This article provides an overview of ZigBee-enabled wireless networks and discusses thefeasibility of supporting voice communications over ZigBee networks. We begin by providingan overview of the ZigBee technology followed by an evaluation of voice quality andperformance over such an impoverished wireless channel. Two types of voicecommunications; namely full-duplex voice over IP (VoIP) and half-duplex push-to-talk (PTT)are considered. Voice quality of VoIP is measured using the R-factor [1](a well knownobjective speech quality metric). The quality of PTT; however; is evaluated based on packet-loss rate; delay; and jitter.

Can accurate predictions improve video streaming in cellular networks?,Xuan Kelvin Zou; Jeffrey Erman; Vijay Gopalakrishnan; Emir Halepovic; Rittwik Jana; Xin Jin; Jennifer Rexford; Rakesh K Sinha,Abstract Existing video streaming algorithms use various estimation approaches to infer theinherently variable bandwidth in cellular networks; which often leads to reduced quality ofexperience (QoE). We ask the question:" If accurate bandwidth prediction were possible in acellular network; how much can we improve video QoE?". Assuming we know the bandwidthfor the entire video session; we show that existing streaming algorithms only achievebetween 69%-86% of optimal quality. Since such knowledge may be impractical; we studyalgorithms that know the available bandwidth for a few seconds into the future. We observethat prediction alone is not sufficient and can in fact lead to degraded QoE. However; whencombined with rate stabilization functions; prediction outperforms existing algorithms andreduces the gap with optimal to 4%.

They exploit the users' channel state diversity (induced by fast-fading) and areoptimal for stationary channel state distributions and an infinite time-horizon. However;mobile users experience a nonstationary channel; due to slow-fading (on the order ofseconds); and are associated with base stations for short periods. Hence; we develop thePredictive Finite-horizon PF Scheduling ((PF) 2 S) Framework that exploits mobility.

The effectiveness of intelligent scheduling for multicast video-on-demand,Vaneet Aggarwal; Robert Caldebank; Vijay Gopalakrishnan; Rittwik Jana; KK Ramakrishnan; Fang Yu,Abstract As more and more video content is made available and accessed on-demand;content and service providers face challenges of scale. Today's delivery mechanisms;especially unicast; require resources to scale linearly with the number of receivers andlibrary sizes. Unlike these mechanisms; with multicast; the load on a server is relativelyindependent of the number of receivers. Adopting multicast for on-demand access; however;is challenging because of the need to temporally aggregate requests. In this paper; weinvestigate the importance of an intelligent scheduler and a good data model for achievinggood aggregation of requests into multicast groups. We examine the use of an EarliestDeadline First (EDF)-like scheduler that aims to schedule the transmission of" chunks" ofvideo according to their" deadlines" using multicast.

As vehicles move along roadways; they canquery other vehicles and entities for information. Responses to queries can be used todetermine information such as traffic conditions; a retail store sale; that a restaurant hastables available; and/or that parking spaces are available; for example. Businesses;vehicles; and other entities along roadways can geocast pertinent information to vehiclespassing by. Vehicles can cache information as it is received.,*,2016,24
Location based services in a wireless WAN using cellular digital packet data (CDPD),Rittwik Jana; Theodore Johnson; S Muthukrishnan; Andrea Vitaletti,Abstract This paper shows how a standard mobile data technology; Cellular Digital PacketData (CDPD); can be used to localize mobile data users; and provide location basedservices. We present a location determination system that is handset-based. Using CDPDand modem protocols; this system extracts the location of the users up to the cell sitecoverage in the network; it also exposes this location information to the application layer. Wehave implemented a prototype of the entire system; it works nationwide with mobile laptopand Pocket PC users. The system is adequate for providing personalized location basedservice such as finding close businesses of interest; or business services such as trackingand fleet management; or traffic and re-routing applications; among others.,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM international workshop on Data engineering for wireless and mobile access,2001,21

Characterizing fairness for 3G wireless networks,Vaneet Aggarwal; Rittwik Jana; Jeffrey Pang; KK Ramakrishnan; NK Shankaranarayanan,The end to end system data performance over a 3G cellular network depends on manyfactors such as the number of users; interference; multipath propagation; radio resourcemanagement techniques as well as the interaction between these mechanisms and thetransport protocol's flow and congestion mechanisms. Using controlled experiments in apublic cell site; we investigate the interaction between TCP and the 3G UMTS/HSPAnetwork's resource allocation; and its effect on fairness in the throughput achieved acrossmultiple (up to 26) TCP flows in a loaded cell sector. Our field measurement results indicatethat TCP fairness fluctuates significantly when the air interface (radio link) is the bottleneck.We also observe that TCP fairness is substantially better when the backhaul link (a fixedwired link) is the bottleneck; instead of the air interface.

Network selection for secondary users in cognitive radio systems,Chonggang Wang; Kazem Sohraby; Rittwik Jana; Lusheng Ji; Mahmoud Daneshmand,Existing studies have demonstrated that uneven and dynamic usage patterns by the primaryusers of license-based wireless communication systems can often lead to temporal andspatial spectrum underutilization. This provides an opportunity for the secondary users (SUs)to tap into underutilized frequency bands provided that they are capable of cognitivelyaccessing systems without colliding or impacting the performance of the primary users(PUs). When there are multiple networks with spare spectrum; secondary users canopportunistically choose the best network to access; subject to certain constraints. Incognitive radio systems; this is referred to as the network selection problem for secondaryusers.

Performance bounds for optimum multiuser DS-CDMA systems,Lei Wei; Rittwik Jana,In this letter we estimate the bit error probability (BEP) of optimum multiuser detection forsynchronous and asynchronous code division multiple access (CDMA) systems onGaussian and fading channels. We first compute an upper bound and a lower bound on thebit error probability for a given spreading code; then average the bounds over a fewthousand sets of spreading codes. These bounds are obtained from a partial distancespectrum. On Gaussian channels; the upper bound converges to the lower bound atmoderate to large signal-to-noise ratios. However; on fading channels the upper bounddoes not converge; hence we present our results for the lower bound only.

Zebroid: using IPTV data to support STB-assisted VoD content delivery,Yih-Farn Robin Chen; Rittwik Jana; Daniel Stern; Bin Wei; Mike Yang; Hailong Sun; Jagadeesh Dyaberi,Abstract IPTV; unlike Internet TV; delivers digital TV and multimedia services over IP-basednetworks with the required level of quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE).Linear programming channels in IPTV are delivered through multicast; which is highlyscalable with the number of subscribers. Video-on-demand (VoD) content; on the otherhand; is typically delivered using unicast; which places a heavy load on the VoD servers andall the network components leading to the end-user set-top boxes (STBs) as the demandincreases. With the rapid growth of IPTV subscribers and the shift in video viewing habits;the need to efficiently disseminate large volumes of VoD content has prompted IPTV serviceproviders to consider the use of STBs to assist in video content delivery.

Bounds for minimum Euclidean distance for coded multiuser CDMA systems,Rittwik Jana; Lei Wei,We study two properties of the minimum Euclidean distance (d/sup 2//sub min/) for a codedmultiuser system. They are the upper bound of d/sup 2//sub min/and the effect of non-orthogonal spreading. We prove that if all users use trellis codes with same memory lengthand same number of input bits but different mapping signal sets; then the upper bound of thenormalized minimum distance for trellis coded multiuser CDMA system with non-orthogonalspreading is identical to that of the single-user case. It indicates that the trellis codedmultiuser system may recover the minimum distance loss of the uncoded multiuser systemdue to the non-orthogonal spreading (if there is a such loss).

OSCAR: an optimized stall-cautious adaptive bitrate streaming algorithm for mobile networks,Ahmed H Zahran; Jason Quinlan; Darijo Raca; Cormac J Sreenan; Emir Halepovic; Rakesh K Sinha; Rittwik Jana; Vijay Gopalakrishnan,Abstract The design of an adaptive video client for mobile users is challenged by thefrequent changes in operating conditions. Such conditions present a seeminglyinsurmountable challenge to adaptation algorithms; which may fail to find a balancebetween video rate; stalls; and rate-switching. In an effort to achieve the ideal balance; wedesign OSCAR; a novel adaptive streaming algorithm whose adaptation decisions areoptimized to avoid stalls while maintaining high video quality. Our performance evaluation;using real video and channel traces from both 3G and 4G networks; shows that OSCARachieves the highest percentage of stall-free sessions while maintaining a high quality videoin comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms.,Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Mobile Video,2016,5

However; to better understand and utilize P2Ptechnologies in building a scalable media distribution platform; the nature of the underlyingnetwork must be taken into consideration. Although many P2P simulations have beenconducted previously; very few were evaluated on a real P2P testbed with the properties ofthe physical network in mind.

Using generalized second price auction for congestion pricing,Yih-Farn Chen; Rittwik Jana; Karthik N Kannan,To address network congestion issues; network providers are seeking to shape consumer'susage behavior through economic incentives such as a tiered pricing scheme and/orrestrictions on unlimited data plans. Current pricing schemes; however; do not ad-dress thecongestion problem directly: the prices differentiation is based on the data volumeconsumed by the user in a month whereas the congestion is a consequence of theavailability of limited bandwidth resources (consumption speed). Furthermore; userssubscribing to a costlier plan receive no real-time (higher bandwidth) priority. This paper pro-poses an alternate pricing plan for wireless networks based on Generalized Second Price(GSP) auctions with the aim of improving welfare.

Incentivized cellular offloading via auctions,Wei Dong; Swati Rallapalli; Taewon Cho; Rittwik Jana; Lili Qiu; KK Ramakrishnan; Leonid Razoumov; Yin Zhang,Abstract The explosive growth of cellular traffic and its highly dynamic nature often make itprohibitive or even infeasible for a cellular service provider to provision enough cellularresources to support the peak traffic demands. The current best practice is to have thecellular service provider deploy alternative wireless technologies; such as Wi-Fi andFemtocells; on its own to complement the cellular network. However; this is not a viable long-term solution due to its high cost and the problem of wireless interference. We believe amore viable long-term solution is for the service provider to leverage resources from third-party resource owners on demand by buying capacity whenever needed. Measurementstudies show that many third-party Wi-Fi hotspots and Femtocells have significant sparecapacity even during busy hours.

Joint-family: Enabling adaptive bitrate streaming in peer-to-peer video-on-demand,Kyung-Wook Hwang; Vijay Gopalakrishnan; Rittwik Jana; Seungjoon Lee; Vishal Misra; KK Ramakrishnan; Dan Rubenstein,We propose Joint-Family; a protocol that combines peer-to-peer (P2P) and adaptive bitrate(ABR) streaming for video-on-demand (VoD). While P2P for VoD and ABR have beenproposed previously; they have not been studied together because they attempt to tackleproblems with seemingly orthogonal goals. We motivate our approach through analysis thatovercomes a misconception resulting from prior analytical work; and show that the popularityof a P2P swarm and seed staying time has a significant bearing on the achievable per-receiver download rate. Specifically; our analysis shows that popularity affects swarmefficiency when seeds stay “long enough”.

Distance spectrum computation for equalized MIMO multipath fading channels,Rittwik Jana; Naofal Al-Dhahir; Robert Calderbank,We estimate bit error probability bounds for finite-length delay-optimised multi-input multi-output (MIMO) equalizers. These equalizers shorten the impulse response memory offrequency-selective MIMO channels by minimizing the average energy of the error sequencebetween the equalized MIMO channel impulse response and the target impulse response.We answer an important question in this paper namely; how much asymptotic loss in SNRdo we expect as a result of this shortening? A partial distance spectrum for a 2/spl times/2MIMO channel is evaluated with or without channel shortening equalisers. The union boundis then used to upper bound the bit error probability. Similarly; the lower bound is computedfrom the squared minimum Euclidean distance. Numerical results show that the expectedloss is in the order of 2.5 dB for realistic wireless channel environments.,Wireless Communications and Networking Confernce; 2000. WCNC. 2000 IEEE,2000,2

Predictor based multiuser and single user detection for time varying frequency selective Rayleigh fading CDMA channels,Rittwik Jana; Brian D Hart,Multiuser detection for linearly modulated signals (eg asynchronous code division multipleaccess (CDMA)) sent over a time varying; frequency selective Rayleigh fading channel isconsidered. The multiuser maximum likelihood sequence detector (MLSD) using linearpredictors is derived assuming knowledge of the channel second order statistics only. Thisreceiver is appropriate when there are no pilot tones and the channel's time varying impulseresponse cannot be accurately estimated. The receiver uses predictors to estimate thereceived signal and forms a weighted Euclidean distance between the predicted and thereceived samples. The computational complexity of this receiver grows exponentially withthe number of users; hence; we propose an additional single user receiver that isconstrained to track and lock to the signal of the desired user; but unlike the conventional …,Vehicular Technology Conference Proceedings; 2000.

Optimal multiuser detection of bandlimited DS-CDMA signals; distorted by time-varying; frequency-selective multipath channels,Brian Hart; Rittwik Jana,We have addressed the problem of optimum multiuser detection for bandlimited signalsdistorted by a time-varying; frequency selective channel; and corrupted by additive Gaussiannoise. We have derived the MLSE receiver for this channel using the familiar concept ofmatched filtering. A performance analysis for Rayleigh fading and white noise is in goodagreement with simulations. We propose this optimal multiuser receiver as a benchmark forcomparing the performance of other detectors. Many other receivers exhibit a BER floor infast time varying channels and therefore are unsuitable as a reference. As a final note;realisations of the optimal receiver using different metrics; for example; the squaredEuclidean distance metric; can be derived easily.,Vehicular Technology Conference; 1998.

We investigate the performance of GeoVCom in both simulation and real worldtests using an implementation running on smart phones. Our field deployment andsimulation results show that the number of transmissions per geocast message is kept low;significantly outperforming conventional flooding algorithms and at the same timemaintaining a high (over 90%) success rate.,Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC); 2011 IEEE,2011,*
Limited Chain Relay-A Novel Multimedia Distribution Algorithm and Its Analysis.,Vaidyanathan Ramaswami; Rittwik Jana; Soohan Ahn,Abstract—We describe and analyze a novel algorithm called Limited Chain Relay for on-demand multimedia content distribution over digital networks. Using VoD as an example; weshow that this peer assisted scheme provides bandwidth and processing savingscomparable to a periodic multicast without incurring subscriber delays inherent in the latter.This scheme's success does not depend upon the ability to forecast demand accurately. Ituses minimal storage in participating peer CPEs. It incorporates many features to facilitatefast set up; redundancy to handle peer failures; and centralized OS functions includingbilling. It can be used in a wide variety of networks such as Fiber to the Home and Fiber tothe Curb and with transport technologies like IP and ADSL. It can be used also for streamingcontent where individual clients may not store the entire content.,ICC,2009,*

Blending of external applications with advanced telephony services in the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS),Ron Shacham; Rittwik Jana; Chris W Rice; John F Murray,Advanced feature servers are at the core of enterprise IP telephony; offering traditionalservices; such as call hold; voicemail and find-me-follow-me. These feature servers havebegun to be deployed as IMS Application Servers to support both in-house (premisesbased) or hosted service (IP Centrex) offerings. At the same time; there exist applicationsthat are external to IMS that can provide a richer communications experience; whenintegrated. The application layer in IMS allows these external applications to be blendedwith the advanced telephony features. An example of this is the use of Microsoft OfficeCommunicator for call control. Several current implementations integrate this feature througha back-end proprietary interface to specific feature servers. We present an architecture forgeneralizing this integration with a CSTA/IMS gateway that can interact with any IMS …,IP Multimedia Subsystem Architecture and Applications; 2007 International Conference on,2007,*

Performance Evaluation of Single User and Multiuser CDMA Systems,Rittwik Jana,*,*,1999,*
Bounds for optimum multiuser DS-CDMA systems,Rittwik Jana; Lei Wei,In this paper; we evaluate the performance of optimum multiuser detection by unionbounding techniques for a large number of users. It is a difficult task to analytically computethe average bit error probability of multiuser DS-CDMA systems. In this paper we aim to usebounds to accurately evaluate the optimal performance of a multiuser DS-CDMA system;both synchronous and asynchronous. We present a general algorithm to compute the partialdistance spectrum of the multiuser system. Numerical results for both systems with binaryrandom signature waveforms of length 31 are used to illustrate the method. It has beenfound that the optimal bounds for the asynchronous system have a lower bit error probability(BEP) than synchronous systems. Focus is given to two areas namely 1) computing bit errorprobability (BEP) given a particular correlation matrix; 2) applying optimal conditional …,Personal; Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications; 1996.

Concise Paper: Multi-Path TCP: Boosting Fairness in Cellular Networks,Ashwin Sridharan; Rakesh K Sinha; Rittwik Jana; Bo Han; KK Ramakrishnan; NK Shankaranarayanan; Ioannis Broustis,Abstract—Cellular providers are rapidly deploying multiple technologies like cell biasing;carrier aggregation; co-ordinated interference control/scheduling to improve capacity andcoverage. In this paper; we explore a complementary transport layer approach based onmultipath TCP that can concurrently use multiple interfaces to boost throughput of users withpoor coverage and improve fairness. Multipath TCP has been recently standardized by IETFand requires no modifications to applications. It has been shown to improve fairness andthroughput in wireline environments and individual user throughputs in wireless networks.However; in a wireless multi-user environment; it is not clear that it is always beneficial; aswe show in this paper. Therefore; we examine if it is indeed beneficial for a service providerto judiciously decide whether to enable multiple cellular interfaces on a smartphone …,*,*,*
