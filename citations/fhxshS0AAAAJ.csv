OpenMEEG: opensource software for quasistatic bioelectromagnetics,Alexandre Gramfort; Théodore Papadopoulo; Emmanuel Olivi; Maureen Clerc,Interpreting and controlling bioelectromagnetic phenomena require realistic physiologicalmodels and accurate numerical solvers. A semi-realistic model often used in practise is thepiecewise constant conductivity model; for which only the interfaces have to be meshed.This simplified model makes it possible to use Boundary Element Methods. Unfortunately;most Boundary Element solutions are confronted with accuracy issues when the conductivityratio between neighboring tissues is high; as for instance the scalp/skull conductivity ratio inelectro-encephalography. To overcome this difficulty; we proposed a new method called thesymmetric BEM; which is implemented in the OpenMEEG software. The aim of this paper isto present OpenMEEG; both from the theoretical and the practical point of view; and tocompare its performances with other competing software packages.

Brain covariance selection: better individual functional connectivity models using population prior,Gaël Varoquaux; Alexandre Gramfort; Jean-Baptiste Poline; Bertrand Thirion,Abstract Spontaneous brain activity; as observed in functional neuroimaging; has beenshown to display reproducible structure that expresses brain architecture and carriesmarkers of brain pathologies. An important view of modern neuroscience is that such large-scale structure of coherent activity reflects modularity properties of brain connectivity graphs.However; to date; there has been no demonstration that the limited and noisy data availablein spontaneous activity observations could be used to learn full-brain probabilistic modelsthat generalize to new data. Learning such models entails two main challenges: i) modelingfull brain connectivity is a difficult estimation problem that faces the curse of dimensionalityand ii) variability between subjects; coupled with the variability of functional signals betweenexperimental runs; makes the use of multiple datasets challenging.

Local and long-range functional connectivity is reduced in concert in autism spectrum disorders,Sheraz Khan; Alexandre Gramfort; Nandita R Shetty; Manfred G Kitzbichler; Santosh Ganesan; Joseph M Moran; Su Mei Lee; John DE Gabrieli; Helen B Tager-Flusberg; Robert M Joseph; Martha R Herbert; Matti S Hämäläinen; Tal Kenet,Abstract Long-range cortical functional connectivity is often reduced in autism spectrumdisorders (ASD); but the nature of local cortical functional connectivity in ASD has remainedelusive. We used magnetoencephalography to measure task-related local functionalconnectivity; as manifested by coupling between the phase of alpha oscillations and theamplitude of gamma oscillations; in the fusiform face area (FFA) of individuals diagnosedwith ASD and typically developing individuals while they viewed neutral faces; emotionalfaces; and houses. We also measured task-related long-range functional connectivitybetween the FFA and the rest of the cortex during the same paradigm. In agreement withearlier studies; long-range functional connectivity between the FFA and three distant corticalregions was reduced in the ASD group.

Mixed-norm estimates for the M/EEG inverse problem using accelerated gradient methods,Alexandre Gramfort; Matthieu Kowalski; Matti Hämäläinen,Abstract Magneto-and electroencephalography (M/EEG) measure the electromagnetic fieldsproduced by the neural electrical currents. Given a conductor model for the head; and thedistribution of source currents in the brain; Maxwell's equations allow one to compute theensuing M/EEG signals. Given the actual M/EEG measurements and the solution of thisforward problem; one can localize; in space and in time; the brain regions that haveproduced the recorded data. However; due to the physics of the problem; the limited numberof sensors compared to the number of possible source locations; and measurement noise;this inverse problem is ill-posed. Consequently; additional constraints are needed. Classicalinverse solvers; often called minimum norm estimates (MNE); promote source estimates witha small ℓ 2 norm.

Machine learning for neuroimaging with scikit-learn,Alexandre Abraham; Fabian Pedregosa; Michael Eickenberg; Philippe Gervais; Andreas Mueller; Jean Kossaifi; Alexandre Gramfort; Bertrand Thirion; Gaël Varoquaux,Statistical machine learning methods are increasingly used for neuroimaging data analysis.Their main virtue is their ability to model high-dimensional datasets; eg multivariate analysisof activation images or resting-state time series. Supervised learning is typically used indecoding or encoding settings to relate brain images to behavioral or clinical observations;while unsupervised learning can uncover hidden structures in sets of images (eg restingstate functional MRI) or find sub-populations in large cohorts. By considering differentfunctional neuroimaging applications; we illustrate how scikit-learn; a Python machinelearning library; can be used to perform some key analysis steps. Scikit-learn contains a verylarge set of statistical learning algorithms; both supervised and unsupervised; and itsapplication to neuroimaging data provides a versatile tool to study the brain.,Frontiers in neuroinformatics,2014,124

Here; we perform a systematic analysis of these electroencephalographymarkers by quantifying their efficiency in differentiating patients in a vegetative state fromthose in a minimally conscious or conscious state. Capitalizing on a review of previousexperiments and current theories; we identify a series of measures that can be organizedinto four dimensions:(i) event-related potentials versus ongoing electroencephalographyactivity;(ii) local dynamics versus inter-electrode information exchange;(iii) spectral patternsversus information complexity; and (iv) average versus fluctuations over the recordingsession.

Total variation regularization for fMRI-based prediction of behavior,Vincent Michel; Alexandre Gramfort; Gaël Varoquaux; Evelyn Eger; Bertrand Thirion,While medical imaging typically provides massive amounts of data; the extraction of relevantinformation for predictive diagnosis remains a difficult challenge. Functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI) data; that provide an indirect measure of task-related orspontaneous neuronal activity; are classically analyzed in a mass-univariate procedureyielding statistical parametric maps. This analysis framework disregards some importantprinciples of brain organization: population coding; distributed and overlappingrepresentations. Multivariate pattern analysis; ie; the prediction of behavioral variables frombrain activation patterns better captures this structure. To cope with the high dimensionalityof the data; the learning method has to be regularized. However; the spatial structure of theimage is not taken into account in standard regularization methods; so that the extracted …,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,2011,111
Time-frequency mixed-norm estimates: Sparse M/EEG imaging with non-stationary source activations,Alexandre Gramfort; Daniel Strohmeier; Jens Haueisen; Matti S Hämäläinen; Matthieu Kowalski,Abstract Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) allowfunctional brain imaging with high temporal resolution. While solving the inverse problemindependently at every time point can give an image of the active brain at every millisecond;such a procedure does not capitalize on the temporal dynamics of the signal. Linear inversemethods (minimum-norm; dSPM; sLORETA; beamformers) typically assume that the signalis stationary: regularization parameter and data covariance are independent of time and thetime varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Other recently proposed non-linear inverse solverspromoting focal activations estimate the sources in both space and time while also assumingstationary sources during a time interval. However such a hypothesis holds only for shorttime intervals. To overcome this limitation; we propose time-frequency mixed-norm …,NeuroImage,2013,104
Multi-subject dictionary learning to segment an atlas of brain spontaneous activity,Gaël Varoquaux; Alexandre Gramfort; Fabian Pedregosa; Vincent Michel; Bertrand Thirion,Abstract Fluctuations in brain on-going activity can be used to reveal its intrinsic functionalorganization. To mine this information; we give a new hierarchical probabilistic model forbrain activity patterns that does not require an experimental design to be specified. Weestimate this model in the dictionary learning framework; learning simultaneously latentspatial maps and the corresponding brain activity time-series. Unlike previous dictionarylearning frameworks; we introduce an explicit difference between subject-level spatial mapsand their corresponding population-level maps; forming an atlas. We give a novel algorithmusing convex optimization techniques to solve efficiently this problem with non-smoothpenalties well-suited to image denoising. We show on simulated data that it can recoverpopulation-level maps as well as subject specificities.

Single-trial decoding of auditory novelty responses facilitates the detection of residual consciousness,JR King; Frédéric Faugeras; Alexandre Gramfort; A Schurger; I El Karoui; JD Sitt; B Rohaut; C Wacongne; E Labyt; Tristan Bekinschtein; Laurent Cohen; Lionel Naccache; Stanislas Dehaene,Abstract Detecting residual consciousness in unresponsive patients is a major clinicalconcern and a challenge for theoretical neuroscience. To tackle this issue; we recentlydesigned a paradigm that dissociates two electro-encephalographic (EEG) responses toauditory novelty. Whereas a local change in pitch automatically elicits a mismatch negativity(MMN); a change in global sound sequence leads to a late P300b response. The lattercomponent is thought to be present only when subjects consciously perceive the globalnovelty. Unfortunately; it can be difficult to detect because individual variability is high;especially in clinical recordings. Here; we show that multivariate pattern classifiers canextract subject-specific EEG patterns and predict single-trial local or global noveltyresponses. We first validate our method with 38 high-density EEG; MEG and intracranial …,Neuroimage,2013,81
A supervised clustering approach for fMRI-based inference of brain states,Vincent Michel; Alexandre Gramfort; Gaël Varoquaux; Evelyn Eger; Christine Keribin; Bertrand Thirion,Abstract We propose a method that combines signals from many brain regions observed infunctional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to predict the subject's behavior during ascanning session. Such predictions suffer from the huge number of brain regions sampledon the voxel grid of standard fMRI data sets: the curse of dimensionality. Dimensionalityreduction is thus needed; but it is often performed using a univariate feature selectionprocedure; that handles neither the spatial structure of the images; nor the multivariatenature of the signal. By introducing a hierarchical clustering of the brain volume thatincorporates connectivity constraints; we reduce the span of the possible spatialconfigurations to a single tree of nested regions tailored to the signal. We then prune the treein a supervised setting; hence the name supervised clustering; in order to extract a …,Pattern Recognition,2012,79
Small-sample brain mapping: sparse recovery on spatially correlated designs with randomization and clustering,Gaël Varoquaux; Alexandre Gramfort; Bertrand Thirion,Abstract: Functional neuroimaging can measure the brain? s response to an externalstimulus. It is used to perform brain mapping: identifying from these observations the brainregions involved. This problem can be cast into a linear supervised learning task where theneuroimaging data are used as predictors for the stimulus. Brain mapping is then seen as asupport recovery problem. On functional MRI (fMRI) data; this problem is particularlychallenging as i) the number of samples is small due to limited acquisition time and ii) thevariables are strongly correlated. We propose to overcome these difficulties using sparseregression models over new variables obtained by clustering of the original variables. Theuse of randomization techniques; eg bootstrap samples; and clustering of the variablesimproves the recovery properties of sparse methods. We demonstrate the benefit of our …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1206.6447,2012,71
Forward field computation with OpenMEEG,Alexandre Gramfort; Théodore Papadopoulo; Emmanuel Olivi; Maureen Clerc,To recover the sources giving rise to electro-and magnetoencephalography in individualmeasurements; realistic physiological modeling is required; and accurate numericalsolutions must be computed. We present OpenMEEG; which solves the electromagneticforward problem in the quasistatic regime; for head models with piecewise constantconductivity. The core of OpenMEEG consists of the symmetric Boundary Element Method;which is based on an extended Green Representation theorem. OpenMEEG is able toprovide lead fields for four different electromagnetic forward problems:Electroencephalography (EEG); Magnetoencephalography (MEG); Electrical ImpedanceTomography (EIT); and intracranial electric potentials (IPs).

Multiscale mining of fMRI data with hierarchical structured sparsity,Rodolphe Jenatton; Alexandre Gramfort; Vincent Michel; Guillaume Obozinski; Evelyn Eger; Francis Bach; Bertrand Thirion,Reverse inference; or brain reading; is a recent paradigm for analyzing functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI) data based on pattern recognition and statistical learning. Bypredicting some cognitive variables related to brain activation maps; this approach aims atdecoding brain activity. Reverse inference takes into account the multivariate informationbetween voxels and is currently the only way to assess how precisely some cognitiveinformation is encoded by the activity of neural populations within the whole brain. However;it relies on a prediction function that is plagued by the curse of dimensionality; since thereare far more features than samples; ie; more voxels than fMRI volumes. To address thisproblem; different methods have been proposed; including univariate feature selection;feature agglomeration; and regularization techniques.

Identifying predictive regions from fMRI with TV-L1 prior,Alexandre Gramfort; Bertrand Thirion; Gaël Varoquaux,Decoding; ie predicting stimulus related quantities from functional brain images; is apowerful tool to demonstrate differences between brain activity across conditions. However;unlike standard brain mapping; it offers no guaranties on the localization of this information.Here; we consider decoding as a statistical estimation problem and show that injecting aspatial segmentation prior leads to unmatched performance in recovering predictive regions.Specifically; we use ℓ 1-penalization to set voxels to zero and Total-Variation (TV)penalization to segment regions. Our contribution is two-fold. On the one hand; we show viaextensive experiments that; amongst a large selection of decoding and brain-mappingstrategies; TV+ ℓ 1 leads to best region recovery. On the other hand; we considerimplementation issues related to this estimator.

Encoding of event timing in the phase of neural oscillations,Anne Kösem; Alexandre Gramfort; Virginie van Wassenhove,Abstract Time perception is a critical component of conscious experience. To be insynchrony with the environment; the brain must deal not only with differences in the speed oflight and sound but also with its computational and neural transmission delays. Here; weasked whether the brain could actively compensate for temporal delays by changing itsprocessing time. Specifically; can changes in neural timing or in the phase of neuraloscillation index perceived timing? For this; a lag-adaptation paradigm was used tomanipulate participants' perceived audiovisual (AV) simultaneity of events while they wererecorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Desynchronized AV stimuli were presentedrhythmically to elicit a robust 1 Hz frequency-tagging of auditory and visual corticalresponses. As participants' perception of AV simultaneity shifted; systematic changes in …,Neuroimage,2014,52
Automatic semantic facilitation in anterior temporal cortex revealed through multimodal neuroimaging,Ellen F Lau; Alexandre Gramfort; Matti S Hämäläinen; Gina R Kuperberg,A core property of human semantic processing is the rapid; facilitatory influence of prior inputon extracting the meaning of what comes next; even under conditions of minimal awareness.Previous work has shown a number of neurophysiological indices of this facilitation; but themapping between time course and localization—critical for separating automatic semanticfacilitation from other mechanisms—has thus far been unclear. In the current study; we useda multimodal imaging approach to isolate early; bottom-up effects of context on semanticmemory; acquiring a combination of electroencephalography (EEG);magnetoencephalography (MEG); and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)measurements in the same individuals with a masked semantic priming paradigm.

Automated model selection in covariance estimation and spatial whitening of MEG and EEG signals,Denis A Engemann; Alexandre Gramfort,Abstract Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/EEG) measure non-invasively the weak electromagnetic fields induced by post-synaptic neural currents. Theestimation of the spatial covariance of the signals recorded on M/EEG sensors is a buildingblock of modern data analysis pipelines. Such covariance estimates are used in brain–computer interfaces (BCI) systems; in nearly all source localization methods for spatialwhitening as well as for data covariance estimation in beamformers. The rationale for suchmodels is that the signals can be modeled by a zero mean Gaussian distribution. Whilemaximizing the Gaussian likelihood seems natural; it leads to a covariance estimate knownas empirical covariance (EC). It turns out that the EC is a poor estimate of the truecovariance when the number of samples is small. To address this issue the estimation …,NeuroImage,2015,41
Mind the duality gap: safer rules for the lasso,Olivier Fercoq; Alexandre Gramfort; Joseph Salmon,Abstract: Screening rules allow to early discard irrelevant variables from the optimization inLasso problems; or its derivatives; making solvers faster. In this paper; we propose newversions of the so-called $\textit {safe rules} $ for the Lasso. Based on duality gapconsiderations; our new rules create safe test regions whose diameters converge to zero;provided that one relies on a converging solver. This property helps screening out morevariables; for a wider range of regularization parameter values. In addition to fasterconvergence; we prove that we correctly identify the active sets (supports) of the solutions infinite time. While our proposed strategy can cope with any solver; its performance isdemonstrated using a coordinate descent algorithm particularly adapted to machinelearning use cases. Significant computing time reductions are obtained with respect to …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1505.03410,2015,40
Improving m/eeg source localizationwith an inter-condition sparse prior,Alexandre Gramfort; Matthieu Kowalski,The inverse problem with distributed dipoles models in M/EEG is strongly ill-posed requiringto set priors on the solution. Most common priors are based on a convenient lscr 2 norm.However such methods are known to smear the estimated distribution of cortical currents. Inorder to provide sparser solutions; other norms than lscr 2 have been proposed in theliterature; but they often do not pass the test of real data. Here we propose to perform theinverse problem on multiple experimental conditions simultaneously and to constrain thecorresponding active regions to be different; while preserving the robust lscr 2 prior overspace and time. This approach is based on a mixed norm that sets a lscr 1 prior betweenconditions. The optimization is performed with an efficient iterative algorithm able to handlehighly sampled distributed models. The method is evaluated on two synthetic datasets …,Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro; 2009. ISBI'09. IEEE International Symposium on,2009,37
Functional brain imaging with M/EEG using structured sparsity in time-frequency dictionaries,Alexandre Gramfort; Daniel Strohmeier; Jens Haueisen; Matti Hamalainen; Matthieu Kowalski,Abstract Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) allowfunctional brain imaging with high temporal resolution. While time-frequency analysis isoften used in the field; it is not commonly employed in the context of the ill-posed inverseproblem that maps the MEG and EEG measurements to the source space in the brain. In thiswork; we detail how convex structured sparsity can be exploited to achieve a principled andmore accurate functional imaging approach. Importantly; time-frequency dictionaries cancapture the non-stationary nature of brain signals and state-of-the-art convex optimizationprocedures based on proximal operators allow the derivation of a fast estimation algorithm.We compare the accuracy of our new method to recently proposed inverse solvers with helpof simulations and analysis of real MEG data.,Biennial International Conference on Information Processing in Medical Imaging,2011,36

Two distinct dynamic modes subtend the detection of unexpected sounds,Jean-Rémi King; Alexandre Gramfort; Aaron Schurger; Lionel Naccache; Stanislas Dehaene,The brain response to auditory novelty comprises two main EEG components: an earlymismatch negativity and a late P300. Whereas the former has been proposed to reflect aprediction error; the latter is often associated with working memory updating. Interestingly;these two proposals predict fundamentally different dynamics: prediction errors are thoughtto propagate serially through several distinct brain areas; while working memory supposesthat activity is sustained over time within a stable set of brain areas. Here we test thistemporal dissociation by showing how the generalization of brain activity patterns acrosstime can characterize the dynamics of the underlying neural processes. This method isapplied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings acquired from healthy participantswho were presented with two types of auditory novelty. Following our predictions; the …,PloS one,2014,32
Denoising and fast diffusion imaging with physically constrained sparse dictionary learning,Alexandre Gramfort; Cyril Poupon; Maxime Descoteaux,Abstract Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) allows imaging the geometry of water diffusion inbiological tissues. However; DW images are noisy at high b-values and acquisitions areslow when using a large number of measurements; such as in Diffusion Spectrum Imaging(DSI). This work aims to denoise DWI and reduce the number of required measurements;while maintaining data quality. To capture the structure of DWI data; we use sparsedictionary learning constrained by the physical properties of the signal: symmetry andpositivity. The method learns a dictionary of diffusion profiles on all the DW images at thesame time and then scales to full brain data. Its performance is investigated with simulationsand two real DSI datasets. We obtain better signal estimates from noisy measurements thanby applying mirror symmetry through the q-space origin; Gaussian denoising or state-of …,Medical image analysis,2014,25
Seeing it all: Convolutional network layers map the function of the human visual system,Michael Eickenberg; Alexandre Gramfort; Gaël Varoquaux; Bertrand Thirion,Abstract Convolutional networks used for computer vision represent candidate models forthe computations performed in mammalian visual systems. We use them as a detailedmodel of human brain activity during the viewing of natural images by constructing predictivemodels based on their different layers and BOLD fMRI activations. Analyzing the predictiveperformance across layers yields characteristic fingerprints for each visual brain region:early visual areas are better described by lower level convolutional net layers and latervisual areas by higher level net layers; exhibiting a progression across ventral and dorsalstreams. Our predictive model generalizes beyond brain responses to natural images. Weillustrate this on two experiments; namely retinotopy and face-place oppositions; bysynthesizing brain activity and performing classical brain mapping upon it. The synthesis …,NeuroImage,2017,23
GAP safe screening rules for sparse multi-task and multi-class models,Eugene Ndiaye; Olivier Fercoq; Alexandre Gramfort; Joseph Salmon,Abstract High dimensional regression benefits from sparsity promoting regularizations.Screening rules leverage the known sparsity of the solution by ignoring some variables inthe optimization; hence speeding up solvers. When the procedure is proven not to discardfeatures wrongly the rules are said to be safe. In this paper we derive new safe rules forgeneralized linear models regularized with L1 and L1/L2 norms. The rules are based onduality gap computations and spherical safe regions whose diameters converge to zero.This allows to discard safely more variables; in particular for low regularization parameters.The GAP Safe rule can cope with any iterative solver and we illustrate its performance oncoordinate descent for multi-task Lasso; binary and multinomial logistic regression;demonstrating significant speed ups on all tested datasets with respect to previous safe …,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,2015,23
Data-driven HRF estimation for encoding and decoding models,Fabian Pedregosa; Michael Eickenberg; Philippe Ciuciu; Bertrand Thirion; Alexandre Gramfort,Abstract Despite the common usage of a canonical; data-independent; hemodynamicresponse function (HRF); it is known that the shape of the HRF varies across brain regionsand subjects. This suggests that a data-driven estimation of this function could lead to morestatistical power when modeling BOLD fMRI data. However; unconstrained estimation of theHRF can yield highly unstable results when the number of free parameters is large. Wedevelop a method for the joint estimation of activation and HRF by means of a rankconstraint; forcing the estimated HRF to be equal across events or experimental conditions;yet permitting it to differ across voxels. Model estimation leads to an optimization problemthat we propose to solve with an efficient quasi-Newton method; exploiting fast gradientcomputations. This model; called GLM with Rank-1 constraint (R1-GLM); can be extended …,NeuroImage,2015,22
Markov models for fMRI correlation structure: is brain functional connectivity small world; or decomposable into networks?,Gaël Varoquaux; Alexandre Gramfort; Jean Baptiste Poline; Bertrand Thirion,Abstract Correlations in the signal observed via functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging(fMRI); are expected to reveal the interactions in the underlying neural populations throughhemodynamic response. In particular; they highlight distributed set of mutually correlatedregions that correspond to brain networks related to different cognitive functions. Yet graph-theoretical studies of neural connections give a different picture: that of a highly integratedsystem with small-world properties: local clustering but with short pathways across thecomplete structure. We examine the conditional independence properties of the fMRI signal;ie its Markov structure; to find realistic assumptions on the connectivity structure that arerequired to explain the observed functional connectivity. In particular we seek adecomposition of the Markov structure into segregated functional networks using …,Journal of physiology-Paris,2012,22
Spatiotemporal signatures of lexical–semantic prediction,Ellen F Lau; Kirsten Weber; Alexandre Gramfort; Matti S Hämäläinen; Gina R Kuperberg,Abstract Although there is broad agreement that top-down expectations can facilitate lexical–semantic processing; the mechanisms driving these effects are still unclear. In particular;while previous electroencephalography (EEG) research has demonstrated a reduction in theN400 response to words in a supportive context; it is often challenging to dissociatefacilitation due to bottom-up spreading activation from facilitation due to top-downexpectations. The goal of the current study was to specifically determine the cortical areasassociated with facilitation due to top-down prediction; using magnetoencephalography(MEG) recordings supplemented by EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)in a semantic priming paradigm. In order to modulate expectation processes while holdingcontext constant; we manipulated the proportion of related pairs across 2 blocks (10 and …,Cerebral Cortex,2014,21
Phase delays within visual cortex shape the response to steady-state visual stimulation,Benoit Cottereau; Jean Lorenceau; Alexandre Gramfort; Maureen Clerc; Bertrand Thirion; Sylvain Baillet,Abstract Although the spatial organization of visual areas can be revealed by functionalMagnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI); the synoptic; non-invasive access to the temporalcharacteristics of the information flow amongst distributed visual processes remains atechnical and methodological challenge. Using frequency-encoded steady-state visualstimulation together with a combination of time-resolved functional magnetic source imagingfrom magnetoencephalography (MEG) and anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);this study evidences maps of visuotopic sustained oscillatory neural responses distributedacross the visual cortex. Our results further reveal relative phase delays across respondingstriate and extra-striate visual areas; which thereby shape the chronometry of neuralprocesses amongst these regions. The methodology developed in this study points at …,Neuroimage,2011,20
Benchmarking solvers for TV-ℓ 1 least-squares and logistic regression in brain imaging,Elvis Dopgima Dohmatob; Alexandre Gramfort; Bertrand Thirion; Gael Varoquaux,Learning predictive models from brain imaging data; as in decoding cognitive states fromfMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging); is typically an ill-posed problem as it entailsestimating many more parameters than available sample points. This estimation problemthus requires regularization. Total variation regularization; combined with sparse models;has been shown to yield good predictive performance; as well as stable and interpretablemaps. However; the corresponding optimization problem is very challenging: it is non-smooth; non-separable and heavily ill-conditioned. For the penalty to fully exercise itsstructuring effect on the maps; this optimization problem must be solved to a good toleranceresulting in a computational challenge. Here we explore a wide variety of solvers and exhibittheir convergence properties on fMRI data.

MEG and EEG are non-invasive techniques that measureoutside of the head the electric potentials and the magnetic fields induced by the neuronalactivity; respectively. The objective of these functional brain imaging modalities is to be ableto localize in space and time the origin of the signal measured. To do so very challengingmathematical and computational problems needs to be tackled. The first part of this workproceeds from the biological origin the M/EEG signal to the resolution of the forwardproblem. Starting from Maxwell's equations in their quasi-static formulation and from aphysical model of the head; the forward problem predicts the measurements that would …,*,2009,18
Fast optimal transport averaging of neuroimaging data,Alexandre Gramfort; Gabriel Peyré; Marco Cuturi,Abstract Knowing how the Human brain is anatomically and functionally organized at thelevel of a group of healthy individuals or patients is the primary goal of neuroimagingresearch. Yet computing an average of brain imaging data defined over a voxel grid or atriangulation remains a challenge. Data are large; the geometry of the brain is complex andthe between subjects variability leads to spatially or temporally non-overlapping effects ofinterest. To address the problem of variability; data are commonly smoothed beforeperforming a linear group averaging. In this work we build on ideas originally introduced byKantorovich [18] to propose a new algorithm that can average efficiently non-normalizeddata defined over arbitrary discrete domains using transportation metrics. We show howKantorovich means can be linked to Wasserstein barycenters in order to take advantage …,International Conference on Information Processing in Medical Imaging,2015,16
Supramodal processing optimizes visual perceptual learning and plasticity,Nicolas Zilber; Philippe Ciuciu; Alexandre Gramfort; Leila Azizi; Virginie Van Wassenhove,Abstract Multisensory interactions are ubiquitous in cortex and it has been suggested thatsensory cortices may be supramodal ie capable of functional selectivity irrespective of thesensory modality of inputs (Pascual-Leone and Hamilton; 2001; Renier et al.; 2013;Ricciardi and Pietrini; 2011; Voss and Zatorre; 2012). Here; we asked whether learning todiscriminate visual coherence could benefit from supramodal processing. To this end; threegroups of participants were briefly trained to discriminate which of a red or green intermixedpopulation of random-dot-kinematograms (RDKs) was most coherent in a visual displaywhile being recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG). During training; participantsheard no sound (V); congruent acoustic textures (AV) or auditory noise (AVn); importantly;congruent acoustic textures shared the temporal statistics–ie coherence–of visual RDKs …,Neuroimage,2014,16
Non-negative matrix factorization for single-channel EEG artifact rejection,Cécilia Damon; Antoine Liutkus; Alexandre Gramfort; Slim Essid,New applications of Electroencephalographic recording (EEG) pose new challenges interms of artifact removal. In our work we target applications where the EEG is to be capturedby a single electrode and a number of additional lightweight sensors are allowed. Thus; thispaper introduces a new method for artifact removal for single-channel EEG recordings usingnonnegative matrix factorisation (NMF) in a Gaussian source separation framework. Wefocus the study on ocular artifacts and show that by properly exploiting prior information onthe latter; through the analysis of electrooculographic recordings; our artifact removal resultson single-channel EEG are comparable to the results obtained with the classic multi-channelIndependent Component Analysis technique.,Acoustics; Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP); 2013 IEEE International Conference on,2013,16
Graph-based variability estimation in single-trial event-related neural responses,Alexandre Gramfort; Renaud Keriven; Maureen Clerc,Extracting information from multitrial magnetoencephalography or electroencephalography(EEG) recordings is challenging because of the very low SNR; and because of the inherentvariability of brain responses. The problem of low SNR is commonly tackled by averagingmultiple repetitions of the recordings; also called trials; but the variability of response acrosstrials leads to biased results and limits interpretability. This paper proposes to decode thevariability of neural responses by making use of graph representations. Our approach hasseveral advantages compared to other existing methods that process single-trial data: first; itavoids the a priori definition of a model for the waveform of the neural response; second; itdoes not make use of the average data for parameter estimation; third; it does not suffer frominitialization problems by providing solutions that are global optimum of cost functions; …,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,2010,16
Sparse dsi: Learning dsi structure for denoising and fast imaging,Alexandre Gramfort; Cyril Poupon; Maxime Descoteaux,Abstract Diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) from multiple diffusion-weighted images (DWI)allows to image the complex geometry of water diffusion in biological tissue. To capture thestructure of DSI data; we propose to use sparse coding constrained by physical properties ofthe signal; namely symmetry and positivity; to learn a dictionary of diffusion profiles. Giventhis estimated model of the signal; we can extract better estimates of the signal from noisymeasurements and also speed up acquisition by reducing the number of acquired DWIwhile giving access to high resolution DSI data. The method learns jointly for all the acquiredDWI and scales to full brain data. Working with two sets of 515 DWI images acquired on twodifferent subjects we show that using just half of the data (258 DWI) we can better predict theother 257 DWI than the classic symmetry procedure. The observation holds even if the …,International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention,2012,14
Jitter-adaptive dictionary learning-application to multi-trial neuroelectric signals,Sebastian Hitziger; Maureen Clerc; Alexandre Gramfort; Sandrine Saillet; Christian Bénar; Théodore Papadopoulo,Abstract: Dictionary Learning has proven to be a powerful tool for many image processingtasks; where atoms are typically defined on small image patches. As a drawback; thedictionary only encodes basic structures. In addition; this approach treats patches of differentlocations in one single set; which means a loss of information when features are well-aligned across signals. This is the case; for instance; in multi-trial magneto-orelectroencephalography (M/EEG). Learning the dictionary on the entire signals could makeuse of the alignement and reveal higher-level features. In this case; however; smallmissalignements or phase variations of features would not be compensated for. In thispaper; we propose an extension to the common dictionary learning framework to overcomethese limitations by allowing atoms to adapt their position across signals. The method is …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1301.3611,2013,12

Gap safe screening rules for sparse-group lasso,Eugene Ndiaye; Olivier Fercoq; Alexandre Gramfort; Joseph Salmon,Abstract For statistical learning in high dimension; sparse regularizations have proven usefulto boost both computational and statistical efficiency. In some contexts; it is natural to handlemore refined structures than pure sparsity; such as for instance group sparsity. Sparse-Group Lasso has recently been introduced in the context of linear regression to enforcesparsity both at the feature and at the group level. We propose the first (provably) safescreening rules for Sparse-Group Lasso; ie; rules that allow to discard early in the solverfeatures/groups that are inactive at optimal solution. Thanks to efficient dual gapcomputations relying on the geometric properties of $\epsilon $-norm; safe screening rulesfor Sparse-Group Lasso lead to significant gains in term of computing time for our coordinatedescent implementation.,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,2016,11
Improved MEG/EEG source localization with reweighted mixed-norms,Daniel Strohmeier; Jens Haueisen; Alexandre Gramfort,MEG/EEG source imaging allows for the noninvasive analysis of brain activity with hightemporal and good spatial resolution. As the bioelectromagnetic inverse problem is ill-posed; a priori information is required to find a unique source estimate. For the analysis ofevoked brain activity; spatial sparsity of the neuronal activation can be assumed. Due to theconvexity; ℓ-norm based constraints are often used for this; which however lead to sourceestimates biased in amplitude and often suboptimal in terms of source selection. As analternative; non-convex regularization functionals such as ℓ p-quasinorms with 0<; p<; 1 canbe used. In this work; we present a MEG/EEG inverse solver based on a ℓ 2; 0.5-quasinormpenalty promoting spatial sparsity as well as temporal stationarity of the brain activity. Forsolving the resulting non-convex optimization problem; we propose the iterative …,Pattern Recognition in Neuroimaging; 2014 International Workshop on,2014,11
Learning to rank from medical imaging data,Fabian Pedregosa; Elodie Cauvet; Gaël Varoquaux; Christophe Pallier; Bertrand Thirion; Alexandre Gramfort,Abstract Medical images can be used to predict a clinical score coding for the severity of adisease; a pain level or the complexity of a cognitive task. In all these cases; the predictedvariable has a natural order. While a standard classifier discards this information; we wouldlike to take it into account in order to improve prediction performance. A standard linearregression does model such information; however the linearity assumption is likely not besatisfied when predicting from pixel intensities in an image. In this paper we address thesemodeling challenges with a supervised learning procedure where the model aims to orderor rank images. We use a linear model for its robustness in high dimension and its possibleinterpretation. We show on simulations and two fMRI datasets that this approach is able topredict the correct ordering on pairs of images; yielding higher prediction accuracy than …,International Workshop on Machine Learning in Medical Imaging,2012,10
The iterative reweighted Mixed-Norm Estimate for spatio-temporal MEG/EEG source reconstruction,Daniel Strohmeier; Yousra Bekhti; Jens Haueisen; Alexandre Gramfort,Source imaging based on magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography(EEG) allows for the non-invasive analysis of brain activity with high temporal and goodspatial resolution. As the bioelectromagnetic inverse problem is ill-posed; constraints arerequired. For the analysis of evoked brain activity; spatial sparsity of the neuronal activationis a common assumption. It is often taken into account using convex constraints based onthe l 1-norm. The resulting source estimates are however biased in amplitude and oftensuboptimal in terms of source selection due to high correlations in the forward model. In thiswork; we demonstrate that an inverse solver based on a block-separable penalty with aFrobenius norm per block and al 0.5-quasinorm over blocks addresses both of these issues.For solving the resulting non-convex optimization problem; we propose the iterative …,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,2016,9
Decoding visual percepts induced by word reading with fMRI,Alexandre Gramfort; Christophe Pallier; Gaël Varoquaux; Bertrand Thirion,Word reading involves multiple cognitive processes. To infer which word is being visualized;the brain first processes the visual percept; deciphers the letters; bigrams; and activatesdifferent words based on context or prior expectation like word frequency. In thiscontribution; we use supervised machine learning techniques to decode the first step of thisprocessing stream using functional Magnetic Resonance Images (fMRI). We build a decoderthat predicts the visual percept formed by four letter words; allowing us to identify words thatwere not present in the training data. To do so; we cast the learning problem as multipleclassification problems after describing words with multiple binary attributes. This work goesbeyond the identification or reconstruction of single letters or simple geometrical shapes[1];[2] and addresses a challenging estimation problem; that is the prediction of multiple …,Pattern Recognition in NeuroImaging (PRNI); 2012 International Workshop on,2012,8
Beyond brain reading: randomized sparsity and clustering to simultaneously predict and identify,Alexandre Gramfort; Gaël Varoquaux; Bertrand Thirion,Abstract The prediction of behavioral covariates from functional MRI (fMRI) is known as brainreading. From a statistical standpoint; this challenge is a supervised learning task. Theability to predict cognitive states from new data gives a model selection criterion: predictionaccuracy. While a good prediction score implies that some of the voxels used by theclassifier are relevant; one cannot state that these voxels form the brain regions involved inthe cognitive task. The best predictive model may have selected by chance non-informativeregions; and neglected relevant regions that provide duplicate information. In thiscontribution; we address the support identification problem. The proposed approach relieson randomization techniques which have been proved to be consistent for support recovery.To account for the spatial correlations between voxels; our approach makes use of a …,*,2012,8
Accelerating ISTA with an active set strategy,Matthieu Kowalski; Pierre Weiss; Alexandre Gramfort; Sandrine Anthoine,Starting from a practical implementation of Roth and Fisher's algorithm to solve a Lasso-typeproblem; we propose and study the Active Set Iterative Shrinkage/Thresholding Algorithm(AS-ISTA). The convergence is proven by observing that the algorithm can be seen as aparticular case of a coordinate gradient descent algorithm with a Gauss-Southwell-r rule. Weprovide experimental evidence that the proposed method can outperform FISTA andsignificantly speed-up the resolution of very undetermined inverse problems when usingsparse convex priors. The proposed algorithm makes brain mapping with magneto-andelectroencephalography (M/EEG) significantly faster when promoting spatially sparse andtemporally smooth solutions using a''group-Lasso''$\ell_ {21} $ mixed-norm.,OPT 2011: 4th International Workshop on Optimization for Machine Learning,2011,8
The symmetric BEM: bringing in more variables for better accuracy,Maureen Clerc; Alexandre Gramfort; Emmanuel Olivi; Theo Papadopoulo,Abstract Electrophysiological modeling of Magneto-and Electro-encephalography (MEG andEEG) rely on accurate forward solvers that relate source activities to sensor measurements.In comparing a Boundary Element (BEM) and a Finite Element Method (FEM) for forwardelectroencephalography; in our early numerical experiments; we found the FEM to have abetter accuracy than the BEM. This triggered a quest to improve the accuracy of BoundaryElement Methods and led us to study the extended Green representation theorem. Afundamental result in potential theory shows that; up to an additive constant; a harmonicfunction is determined within a domain from its value on the boundary (Dirichlet condition);or the value of its normal derivative (Neumann condition). The Green RepresentationTheorem has been used in forward EEG and MEG modeling; in deriving the Geselowitz …,*,2010,8
Calibration of One-Class SVM for MV set estimation,Albert Thomas; Vincent Feuillard; Alexandre Gramfort,A general approach for anomaly detection or novelty detection consists in estimating highdensity regions or Minimum Volume (MV) sets. The One-Class Support Vector Machine(OCSVM) is a state-of-the-art algorithm for estimating such regions from high dimensionaldata. Yet it suffers from practical limitations. When applied to a limited number of samples itcan lead to poor performance even when picking the best hyperparameters. Moreover thesolution of OCSVM is very sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which makes it hardto optimize in an unsupervised setting. We present a new approach to estimate MV setsusing the OCSVM with a different choice of the parameter controlling the proportion ofoutliers. The solution function of the OCSVM is learnt on a training set and the desiredprobability mass is obtained by adjusting the offset on a test set to prevent overfitting …,Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA); 2015. 36678 2015.

Tracking cortical activity from M/EEG using graph cuts with spatiotemporal constraints,Alexandre Gramfort; Theodore Papadopoulo; Sylvain Baillet; Maureen Clerc,Abstract This work proposes to use magnetoencephalography (MEG) andelectroencephalography (EEG) source imaging to provide cinematic representations of thetemporal dynamics of cortical activations. Cortical activation maps; seen as images of theactive brain; are scalar maps defined at the vertices of a triangulated cortical surface. Theycan be computed from M/EEG data using a linear inverse solver every millisecond. Takingas input these activation maps and exploiting both the graph structure of the cortical meshand the high sampling rate of M/EEG recordings; neural activations are tracked over timeusing an efficient graph cut based algorithm. The method estimates the spatiotemporalsupport of the active brain regions. It consists in computing a minimum cut on a particularlydesigned weighted graph imposing spatiotemporal regularity constraints on the activation …,NeuroImage,2011,7
Efficient smoothed concomitant Lasso estimation for high dimensional regression,Eugene Ndiaye; Olivier Fercoq; Alexandre Gramfort; Vincent Leclère; Joseph Salmon,Abstract In high dimensional settings; sparse structures are crucial for efficiency; both in termof memory; computation and performance. It is customary to consider ℓ 1 penalty to enforcesparsity in such scenarios. Sparsity enforcing methods; the Lasso being a canonicalexample; are popular candidates to address high dimension. For efficiency; they rely ontuning a parameter trading data fitting versus sparsity. For the Lasso theory to hold thistuning parameter should be proportional to the noise level; yet the latter is often unknown inpractice. A possible remedy is to jointly optimize over the regression parameter as well asover the noise level. This has been considered under several names in the literature: Scaled-Lasso; Square-root Lasso; Concomitant Lasso estimation for instance; and could be ofinterest for uncertainty quantification. In this work; after illustrating numerical difficulties for …,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2017,6

Theresulting factorization; called Flexible Approximate MUlti-layer Sparse Transform (FAμST);yields reduced multiplication costs by the matrix and its adjoint. Such a desirable propertycan be used to speed up iterative algorithms commonly used to solve high dimensionallinear inverse problems. The proposed approach is first motivated; introduced and related toprior art. The compromise between computational efficiency and data fidelity is theninvestigated; and finally the relevance of the approach is demonstrated on a problem ofbrain source localization using simulated magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals.,Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO); 2015 23rd European,2015,6
Learning from M/EEG data with variable brain activation delays,Wojciech Zaremba; M Pawan Kumar; Alexandre Gramfort; Matthew B Blaschko,Abstract Magneto-and electroencephalography (M/EEG) measure the electromagneticsignals produced by brain activity. In order to address the issue of limited signal-to-noiseratio (SNR) with raw data; acquisitions consist of multiple repetitions of the same experiment.An important challenge arising from such data is the variability of brain activations over therepetitions. It hinders statistical analysis such as prediction performance in a supervisedlearning setup. One such confounding variability is the time offset of the peak of theactivation; which varies across repetitions. We propose to address this misalignment issueby explicitly modeling time shifts of different brain responses in a classification setup. To thisend; we use the latent support vector machine (LSVM) formulation; where the latent shiftsare inferred while learning the classifier parameters. The inferred shifts are further used to …,International Conference on Information Processing in Medical Imaging,2013,6
Low dimensional representations of MEG/EEG data using laplacian eigenmaps,Alexandre Gramfort; Maureen Clerc,Magneto-encephalography (MEG) and electro-encephalograhy (EEG) experiments providehuge amounts of data and lead to the manipulations of high dimensional objects like timeseries or topographies. In the past; essentially in the last decade; various methods forextracting the structure in complex data have been developed and successfully exploited forvisualization or classification purposes. Here we propose to use one of these methods; theLaplacian eigenmaps; on EEG data and prove that it provides an powerful approach tovisualize and understand the underlying structure of evoked potentials or multitrial timeseries.,Noninvasive Functional Source Imaging of the Brain and Heart and the International Conference on Functional Biomedical Imaging; 2007.

Autoreject: Automated artifact rejection for MEG and EEG data,Mainak Jas; Denis A Engemann; Yousra Bekhti; Federico Raimondo; Alexandre Gramfort,Abstract We present an automated algorithm for unified rejection and repair of bad trials inmagnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Our methodcapitalizes on cross-validation in conjunction with a robust evaluation metric to estimate theoptimal peak-to-peak threshold–a quantity commonly used for identifying bad trials inM/EEG. This approach is then extended to a more sophisticated algorithm which estimatesthis threshold for each sensor yielding trial-wise bad sensors. Depending on the number ofbad sensors; the trial is then repaired by interpolation or by excluding it from subsequentanalysis. All steps of the algorithm are fully automated thus lending itself to the nameAutoreject.

Gap Safe screening rules for sparsity enforcing penalties,Eugene Ndiaye; Olivier Fercoq; Alexandre Gramfort; Joseph Salmon,Abstract In high dimensional regression settings; sparsity enforcing penalties have proveduseful to regularize the data-fitting term. A recently introduced technique called screeningrules propose to ignore some variables in the optimization leveraging the expected sparsityof the solutions and consequently leading to faster solvers. When the procedure isguaranteed not to discard variables wrongly the rules are said to be safe. In this work; wepropose a unifying framework for generalized linear models regularized with standardsparsity enforcing penalties such as l1 or l1 {l2 norms. Our technique allows to discard safelymore variables than previously considered safe rules; particularly for low regularizationparameters.

On the consistency of ordinal regression methods,Fabian Pedregosa; Francis Bach; Alexandre Gramfort,Abstract Many of the ordinal regression models that have been proposed in the literaturecan be seen as methods that minimize a convex surrogate of the zero-one; absolute; orsquared loss functions. A key property that allows to study the statistical implications of suchapproximations is that of Fisher consistency. Fisher consistency is a desirable property forsurrogate loss functions and implies that in the population setting; ie; if the probabilitydistribution that generates the data were available; then optimization of the surrogate wouldyield the best possible model. In this paper we will characterize the Fisher consistency of arich family of surrogate loss functions used in the context of ordinal regression; includingsupport vector ordinal regression; ORBoosting and least absolute deviation. We will seethat; for a family of surrogate loss functions that subsumes support vector ordinal …,The Journal of Machine Learning Research,2017,4

Total Variation regularization enhances regression-based brain activity prediction,Vincent Michel; Alexandre Gramfort; Gael Varoquaux; Bertrand Thirion,While medical imaging typically provides massive amounts of data; the automatic extractionof relevant information in a given applicative context remains a difficult challenge in general.With functional MRI (fMRI); the data provide an indirect measurement of brain activity; thatcan be related to behavioral information. It is now standard to formulate this relation as amachine learning problem where the signal from the entire brain is used to predict a target;typically a behavioral variable. In order to cope with the high dimensionality of the data; thelearning method requires a regularization procedure. Among other alternatives; l1regularization achieves simultaneously a selection of the most predictive features.

Challenging the estimation of cortical activity from MEG with simulated fMRI-constrained retinotopic maps,Alexandre Gramfort; Benoit Cottereau; Maureen Clerc; Bertrand Thirion; Sylvain Baillet,Detection of activity from the primary visual cortex is a difficult challenge to magneto-encephalography (MEG) source imaging techniques: the geometry of the visual cortex isintricate; with structured visual field maps extending deeper along the calcarine fissure. Thisquestions the very sensitivity of MEG to the corresponding neural responses of visual stimuliand the usage of MEG source imaging for innovative retinotopic explorations. In this context;we compare two imaging models of MEG generators in realistic simulations of activationswithin the visual cortex. Localization and spatial extent of neural activity in the visual cortexwere extracted from retinotopic maps obtained in fMRI. We prove that the suggestedapproaches are robust and succeed in accurately recovering the activation patterns withsatisfactory match with fMRI results.

A deep learning architecture for temporal sleep stage classification using multivariate and multimodal time series,Stanislas Chambon; Mathieu Galtier; Pierrick Arnal; Gilles Wainrib; Alexandre Gramfort,Abstract: Sleep stage classification constitutes an important preliminary exam in thediagnosis of sleep disorders and is traditionally performed by a sleep expert who assigns toeach 30s of signal a sleep stage; based on the visual inspection of signals such aselectroencephalograms (EEG); electrooculograms (EOG); electrocardiograms (ECG) andelectromyograms (EMG). In this paper; we introduce the first end-to-end deep learningapproach that performs automatic temporal sleep stage classification from multivariate andmultimodal Polysomnography (PSG) signals.

Caveats with stochastic gradient and maximum likelihood based ICA for EEG,Jair Montoya-Martínez; Jean-François Cardoso; Alexandre Gramfort,Abstract Stochastic gradient (SG) is the most commonly used optimization technique formaximum likelihood based approaches to independent component analysis (ICA). It is inparticular the default solver in public implementations of Infomax and variants. Motivated byexperimental findings on electroencephalography (EEG) data; we report some caveatswhich can impact the results and interpretation of neuroscience findings. We investigateissues raised by controlling the step size in gradient updates combined with early stoppingconditions; as well as initialization choices which can artificially generate biologicallyplausible brain sources; so called dipolar sources. We provide experimental evidence thatpushing the convergence of Infomax using non stochastic solvers can reduce the number ofhighly dipolar components and provide a mathematical explanation of this fact.

Inverse problems with time-frequency dictionaries and non-white gaussian noise,Matthieu Kowalski; Alexandre Gramfort,Sparse regressions to solve ill-posed inverse problems have been massively investigatedover the last decade. Yet; when noise is present in the model; it is almost exclusivelyconsidered as Gaussian and white. While this assumption can hold in practice; it rarelyholds when observations are time series as they are corrupted by auto-correlated andcolored noise. In this work we study sparse regression under the assumption of non whiteGaussian noise and explain how to run the inference using proximal gradient methods. Weinvestigate an application in brain imaging: the problem of source localization usingmagneto-and electroencephalography which allow functional brain imaging with hightemporal resolution.

MEG/EEG source imaging with a non-convex penalty in the time-frequency domain,Daniel Strohmeier; Alexandre Gramfort; Jens Haueisen,Due to the excellent temporal resolution; MEG/EEG source imaging is an importantmeasurement modality to study dynamic processes in the brain. As the bio electromagneticinverse problem is ill-posed; constraints have to be imposed on the source estimates to finda unique solution. These constraints can be applied either in the standard or a transformeddomain. The Time-Frequency Mixed Norm Estimate applies a composite convexregularization functional promoting structured sparsity in the time-frequency domain bycombining an l2; 1-mixed-norm and an l1-norm penalty on the coefficients of the Gabor TFdecomposition of the source signals; to improve the reconstruction of spatially sparse neuralactivations with non-stationary and transient signals. Due to the l1-norm based constraints;the resulting source estimates are however biased in amplitude and often suboptimal in …,Pattern Recognition in NeuroImaging (PRNI); 2015 International Workshop on,2015,3
Mind the noise covariance when localizing brain sources with M/EEG,Denis Engemann; Daniel Strohmeier; Eric Larson; Alexandre Gramfort,Magneto encephalography (MEG) and electroen-cephalography (EEG) are imagingmethods that measure neuronal dynamics non invasively with high temporal precision. It isoften desired in MEG and EEG analysis to estimate the neural sources of the signals.Strategies used for this purpose often take into account the covariance between sensors toyield more precise estimates of the sources. Here we investigate in greater detail how thequality of such covariance estimates conditions the estimation of MEG and EEG sources. Weinvestigated three distinct source localization methods: dynamic Statistical Parametric Maps(dSPM); the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beam former and Mixed-NormEstimates (MxNE). We implemented and evaluated automated strategies for improving thequality of covariance estimates at different stages of data processing.

Blind denoising with random greedy pursuits,Manuel Moussallam; Alexandre Gramfort; Laurent Daudet; Gaël Richard,Denoising methods require some assumptions about the signal of interest and the noise.While most denoising procedures require some knowledge about the noise level; which maybe unknown in practice; here we assume that the signal expansion in a given dictionary hasa distribution that is more heavy-tailed than the noise. We show how this hypothesis leads toa stopping criterion for greedy pursuit algorithms which is independent from the noise level.Inspired by the success of ensemble methods in machine learning; we propose a strategy toreduce the variance of greedy estimates by averaging pursuits obtained from randomlysubsampled dictionaries. We call this denoising procedure Blind Random Pursuit Denoising(BIRD). We offer a generalization to multidimensional signals; with a structured sparsemodel (S-BIRD).

HRF estimation improves sensitivity of fMRI encoding and decoding models,Fabian Pedregosa; Michael Eickenberg; Bertrand Thirion; Alexandre Gramfort,Extracting activation patterns from functional Magnetic Resonance Images (fMRI) datasetsremains challenging in rapid-event designs due to the inherent delay of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal. The general linear model (GLM) allows to estimate the activationfrom a design matrix and a fixed hemodynamic response function (HRF). However; the HRFis known to vary substantially between subjects and brain regions. In this paper; we proposea model for jointly estimating the hemodynamic response function (HRF) and the activationpatterns via a low-rank representation of task effects. This model is based on the linearityassumption behind the GLM and can be computed using standard gradient-based solvers.We use the activation patterns computed by our model as input data for encoding anddecoding studies and report performance improvement in both settings.,Pattern Recognition in Neuroimaging (PRNI); 2013 International Workshop on,2013,3

We detail how inference can be done efficientlywhile guaranteeing model stability. We show how model comparison and hyper-parameterselection can be done using likelihood estimates. We also point out the limits of DAR modelswhen the exogenous signal contains too high frequencies.

Learning the morphology of brain signals using alpha-stable convolutional sparse coding,Mainak Jas; Tom Dupré La Tour; Umut Simsekli; Alexandre Gramfort,Abstract Neural time-series data contain a wide variety of prototypical signal waveforms(atoms) that are of significant importance in clinical and cognitive research. One of the goalsfor analyzing such data is hence to extract suchshift-invariant'atoms.

Non-negative Tensor factorization for single-channel EEG artifact rejection,Cécilia Damon; Antoine Liutkus; Alexandre Gramfort; Slim Essid,New applications of Electroencephalographicrecording (EEG) require light and easy-to-handle equipment involving powerful algorithms of artifact removal. In our work; we exploitinformed source separation methods for artifact removal in EEG recordings with a lownumber of sensors; especially in the extreme case of single-channel recording; by exploitingprior knowledge from auxiliary lightweight sensors capturing artifactual signals. To achievethis; we propose a method using Non-negative Tensor Factorization (NTF) in a Gaussiansource separation framework that proves competitive against the classic IndependentComponent Analysis (ICA) technique. Additionally the both NTF and ICA methods are usedin an original scheme that jointly processes the EEG and auxiliary signals. The adopted NTFstrategy is shown to improve the source estimates accuracy in comparison with the usual …,Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP); 2013 IEEE International Workshop on,2013,2
Second order scattering descriptors predict fMRI activity due to visual textures,Michael Eickenberg; Mehdi Senoussi; Fabian Pedregosa; Alexandre Gramfort; Bertrand Thirion,Second layer scattering descriptors are known to provide good classification performanceon natural quasi-stationary processes such as visual textures due to their sensitivity tohigher order moments and continuity with respect to small deformations. In a functionalMagnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) experiment we present visual textures to subjects andevaluate the predictive power of these descriptors with respect to the predictive power ofsimple contour energy-the first scattering layer. We are able to conclude not only thatinvariant second layer scattering coefficients better encode voxel activity; but also that wellpredicted voxels need not necessarily lie in known retinotopic regions.,Pattern Recognition in Neuroimaging (PRNI); 2013 International Workshop on,2013,2
Improved brain pattern recovery through ranking approaches,Fabian Pedregosa; Elodie Cauvet; Gaël Varoquaux; Christophe Pallier; Bertrand Thirion; Alexandre Gramfort,Inferring the functional specificity of brain regions from functional Magnetic ResonanceImages (fMRI) data is a challenging statistical problem. While the General Linear Model(GLM) remains the standard approach for brain mapping; supervised learning techniques(aka decoding) have proven to be useful to capture multivariate statistical effects distributedacross voxels and brain regions. Up to now; much effort has been made to improvedecoding by incorporating prior knowledge in the form of a particular regularization term. Inthis paper we demonstrate that further improvement can be made by accounting for non-linearities using a ranking approach rather than the commonly used least-squareregression. Through simulation; we compare the recovery properties of our approach tolinear models commonly used in fMRI based decoding. We demonstrate the superiority of …,Pattern Recognition in NeuroImaging (PRNI); 2012 International Workshop on,2012,2
Tracking cortical activity with spatio-temporal constraints using graph-cuts and M/EEG,Alexandre Gramfort; Théodore Papadopoulo; Benoit Cottereau; Sylvain Baillet; Maureen Clerc,This work aims at sketching over time the activity of the brain; providing dynamic maps ofcortical activations triggered by a stimulus. Raw activations are computed from MEG or EEGusing a distributed source model with equivalent current dipoles (ECD) lying on the foldedcortical surface. Exploiting the natural graph structure of the cortical surface and the hightime sampling of MEG and EEG recordings; neural currents reconstructions are used tocompute; in a robust and efficient way; tracks of cortical activations over time. This problem iscasted into a Markov Random Field optimization framework that can be optimized in a fewseconds using graphcuts-based algorithms; which guarantee global optimality of thesolution. A label is assigned to each vertex in space and time; indicating active vs. non-active condition. Such approach computes a minimum cut on a weighted graph related to …,Biomag,2008,2
Non-linear auto-regressive models for cross-frequency coupling in neural time series,Tom Dupré La Tour; Lucille Tallot; Laetitia Grabot; Valérie Doyère; Virginie Van Wassenhove; Yves Grenier; Alexandre Gramfort,Abstract We address the issue of reliably detecting and quantifying cross-frequency coupling(CFC) in neural time series. Based on non-linear auto-regressive models; the proposedmethod provides a generative and parametric model of the time-varying spectral content ofthe signals. As this method models the entire spectrum simultaneously; it avoids the pitfallsrelated to incorrect filtering or the use of the Hilbert transform on wide-band signals. As themodel is probabilistic; it also provides a score of the model “goodness of fit” via thelikelihood; enabling easy and legitimate model selection and parameter comparison; thisdata-driven feature is unique to our model-based approach. Using three datasets obtainedwith invasive neurophysiological recordings in humans and rodents; we demonstrate thatthese models are able to replicate previous results obtained with other metrics; but also …,PLoS computational biology,2017,1
A hierarchical Bayesian perspective on majorization-minimization for non-convex sparse regression: application to M/EEG source imaging,Yousra Bekhti; Felix Lucka; Joseph Salmon; Alexandre Gramfort,Abstract: Majorization-minimization (MM) is a standard iterative optimization techniquewhich consists in minimizing a sequence of convex surrogate functionals. MM approacheshave been particularly successful to tackle inverse problems and statistical machinelearning problems where the regularization term is a sparsity-promoting concave function.However; due to non-convexity; the solution found by MM depends on its initialization.Uniform initialization is the most natural and often employed strategy as it boils down topenalizing all coefficients equally in the first MM iteration. Yet; this arbitrary choice can leadto unsatisfactory results in severely under-determined inverse problems such as sourceimaging with magneto-and electro-encephalography (M/EEG).

Faster independent component analysis by preconditioning with Hessian approximations,Pierre Ablin; Jean-Francois Cardoso; Alexandre Gramfort,Abstract Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a technique for unsupervised explorationof multi-channel data that is widely used in observational sciences. In its classic form; ICArelies on modeling the data as linear mixtures of non-Gaussian independent sources. Themaximization of the corresponding likelihood is a challenging problem if it has to becompleted quickly and accurately on large sets of real data. We introduce thePreconditioned ICA for Real Data (Picard) algorithm; which is a relative L-BFGS algorithmpreconditioned with sparse Hessian approximations. Extensive numerical comparisons toseveral algorithms of the same class demonstrate the superior performance of the proposedtechnique; especially on real data; for which the ICA model does not necessarily hold.,Arxiv Preprint,2017,1
Anomaly Detection in Extreme Regions via Empirical MV-sets on the Sphere,Albert Thomas; Stephan Clémençon; Alexandre Gramfort; Anne Sabourin,Abstract Extreme regions in the feature space are of particular concern for anomalydetection: anomalies are likely to be located in the tails; whereas data scarcity in suchregions makes it difficult to distinguish between large normal instances and anomalies. Thispaper presents an unsupervised algorithm for anomaly detection in extreme regions. Wepropose a Minimum Volume set (MV-set) approach relying on multivariate extreme valuetheory. This framework includes a canonical pre-processing step; which addresses the issueof output sensitivity to standardization choices. The resulting data representation on thesphere highlights the dependence structure of the extremal observations. Anomaly detectionis then cast as a MV-set estimation problem on the sphere; where volume is measured bythe spherical measure and mass refers to the angular measure.

Decoding the categorization of visual motion with magnetoencephalography,Yousra Bekhti; Alexandre Gramfort; Nicolas Zilber; Virginie van Wassenhove,Brain decoding techniques are particularly efficient at deciphering weak and distributedneural patterns. Brain decoding has primarily been used in cognitive neurosciences topredict differences between pairs of stimuli (eg faces vs. houses); but how distinctbrain/perceptual states can be decoded following the presentation of continuous sensorystimuli is unclear. Here; we developed a novel approach to decode brain activity recordedwith magnetoencephalography while participants discriminated the coherence of twointermingled clouds of dots. Seven levels of visual motion coherence were tested andparticipants reported the colour of the most coherent cloud.

Automated rejection and repair of bad trials in MEG/EEG,Mainak Jas; Denis Engemann; Federico Raimondo; Yousra Bekhti; Alexandre Gramfort,We present an automated solution for detecting bad trials in magneto-/electroencephalography (M/EEG). Bad trials are commonly identified using peak-to-peakrejection thresholds that are set manually. This work proposes a solution to determine themautomatically using cross-validation. We show that automatically selected rejectionthresholds perform at par with manual thresholds; which can save hours of visual datainspection. We then use this automated approach to learn a sensor-specific rejectionthreshold. Finally; we use this approach to remove trials with finer precision and/or partiallyrepair them using interpolation. We illustrate the performance on three public datasets. Themethod clearly performs better than a competitive benchmark on a 19-subject Faces dataset.,Pattern Recognition in Neuroimaging (PRNI); 2016 International Workshop on,2016,1
M/EEG source localization with multi-scale time-frequency dictionaries,Yousra Bekhti; Daniel Strohmeiery; Mainak Jas; Roland Badeau; Alexandre Gramfort,Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) source localization isa challenging illposed problem. To identify an appropriate solution out of an infinite set ofpossible candidates; the problem requires setting certain constraints depending on theassumptions or a priori knowledge about the source distribution. Different constraints havebeen proposed so far; including those that impose sparsity on the source reconstruction inboth standard and time-frequency domains. Source localization in the time-frequencydomain has already been investigated using Gabor dictionary in both a convex (TF-MxNE)and non-convex way (Iterative Reweighted TF-MxNE). The iterative reweighted (ir) TF-MxNEsolver has been shown to outperform TF-MxNE in both source recovery and amplitude bias.However; the choice of an optimal dictionary remains unsolved.

Decoding perceptual thresholds from MEG/EEG,Yousra Bekhti; Nicolas Zilber; Fabian Pedregosa; Philippe Ciuciu; Virginie Van Wassenhove; Alexandre Gramfort,Magnetoencephalography (MEG) can map brain activity by recording the electromagneticfields generated by the electrical currents in the brain during a perceptual or cognitive task.This technique offers a very high temporal resolution that allows noninvasive brainexploration at a millisecond (ms) time scale. Decoding; aka brain reading; consists inpredicting from neuroimaging data the subject's behavior and/or the parameters of theperceived stimuli. This is facilitated by the use of supervised learning techniques. In thiswork we consider the problem of decoding a target variable with ordered values. This targetreflects the use of a parametric experimental design in which a parameter of the stimulus iscontinuously modulated during the experiment.

Multilayer scattering image analysis fits fmri activity in visual areas,Michael Eickenberg; Alexandre Gramfort; Bertrand Thirion,The scattering transform is a hierarchical signal transformation that has been designed to berobust to signal deformations. It can be used to compute representations with invariance ortolerance to any transformation group; such as translations; rotations or scaling. In imageanalysis; going beyond edge detection; its second layer captures higher order features;providing a fine-grain dissection of the signal. Here we use the output coefficients to fit bloodoxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in visual areas using functional magnetic resonanceimaging. Significant improvement in the prediction accuracy is shown when using thesecond layer in addition to the first; suggesting biological relevance of the features extractedin layer two or linear combinations thereof.,Pattern Recognition in NeuroImaging (PRNI); 2012 International Workshop on,2012,1
A comparative study of algorithms for intra-and inter-subjects fMRI decoding,Vincent Michel; Alexandre Gramfort; Evelyn Eger; Gaël Varoquaux; Bertrand Thirion,Abstract Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) provides a unique opportunity tostudy brain functional architecture; while being minimally invasive. Reverse inference; akadecoding; is a recent statistical analysis approach that has been used with success fordeciphering activity patterns that are thought to fit the neuroscientific concept of populationcoding. Decoding relies on the selection of brain regions in which the observed activity ispredictive of certain cognitive tasks. The accuracy of such a procedure is quantified by theprediction of the behavioral variable of interest–the target. In this paper; we discuss theoptimality of decoding methods in two different settings; namely intra-and inter-subject kindof decoding. While inter-subject prediction aims at finding predictive regions that are stableacross subjects; it is plagued by the additional inter-subject variability (lack of voxel-to …,*,2012,1

Adjoint method for lead-fields computation in MEEG.,Emmanuel Olivi; Alexandre Gramfort; Théodore Papadopoulo; Maureen Clerc,Functional brain imaging with M/EEG (Magneto/Electro-EncephaloGraphy) requires first tocompute the forward problem whose solution is called lead-field matrix. The lead-field matrixis obtained by concatenating the forward fields computed for thousands of sourcescharacterized by their positions; orientations and strengths. A line of this lead-field matrixrepresents the physical quantity (potential for EEG; or some components of the magneticfield for MEG) at a sensor for each source. The number of sources largely exceeds thenumber of sensors (up to 256 electrodes for EEG; and less than 600 squids for MEG). Whensolving the forward problem with a BEM (Boundary Element Method); the lead-field matrix isgenerally computed column-by-column; ie source by source; which represents nsourcesresolutions of the forward problem.

OpenMEEG for M/EEG forward modeling: a comparison study,Alexandre Gramfort; Théodore Papadopoulo; Emmanuel Olivi; Maureen Clerc,Neuroimaging with magneto and electroencephalography (M/EEG) requires to compute theforward problem. It consists in predicting what is measured by MEG or EEG sensors due to aconfiguration of current generators within the head. When considering realistic head models;the equations derived from Maxwell equations can only be solved numerically. TheBoundary Element Method is a standard approach to address this problem. However;different mathematical and computational variants exist within this class of BEM solvers. Atleast two BEM formulations exist for M/EEG forward modeling (Geselowitz; 1967 and Kybicet al.; 2005).

Multi-condition M/EEG inverse modeling with sparsity assumptions: how to estimate what is common and what is specific in multiple experimental conditions,Alexandre Gramfort,Abstract M/EEG inverse modeling with distributed dipolar source models and penalizationswith sparsity inducing norms (eg ℓ 1 withMCE [1]; ℓ 0 with FOCUSS [2]; ℓ 2− ℓ 1 [3]) offer away to select a set of active dipoles. Indeed; sparsity inducing norms lead to solutions wheremost of the sources are set to zero and the remaining non zero sources form the set ofestimated active dipoles. When running cognitive studies multiple experimental conditionsare usually involved and cognitive hypothesis classically consist in quantifying the differencebetween these conditions. The problem is that when a sparse inverse solver is usedindependently for each experimental condition; it happens that the selection of dipolarsources is not consistent across conditions; thus limiting further analysis. Even if allconditions share a common dipolar source; due to noise; it can happen that such solvers …,*,2010,1

Driver estimation in non-linear autoregressive models,Tom Dupré La Tour; Yves Grenier; Alexandre Gramfort,In non-linear autoregressive models; the time dependency of coefficients is often driven by aparticular time-series which is not given and thus has to be estimated from the data. To allowmodel evaluation on a validation set; we describe a parametric approach for such driverestimation. After estimating the driver as a weighted sum of potential drivers; we use it in anon-linear autoregressive model with a polynomial parametrization.

Dual Extrapolation for Faster Lasso Solvers,Mathurin Massias; Alexandre Gramfort; Joseph Salmon,Abstract: Convex sparsity-inducing regularizations are ubiquitous in high-dimensionmachine learning; but their non-differentiability requires the use of iterative solvers. Toaccelerate such solvers; state-of-the-art approaches consist in reducing the size of theoptimization problem at hand. In the context of regression; this can be achieved either bydiscarding irrelevant features (screening techniques) or by prioritizing features likely to beincluded in the support of the solution (working set techniques). Duality comes into play atseveral steps in these techniques. Here; we propose an extrapolation technique startingfrom a sequence of iterates in the dual that leads to the construction of an improved dualpoint. This enables a tighter control of optimality as used in stopping criterion; as well asbetter screening performance of Gap Safe rules.

Heteroscedastic Concomitant Lasso for sparse multimodal electromagnetic brain imaging,Mathurin Massias; Olivier Fercoq; Alexandre Gramfort; Joseph Salmon,Abstract: In high dimension; it is customary to consider $\ell_1 $-penalty regularizedestimators to enforce sparsity; the Lasso being a canonical example. For statisticalefficiency; they rely on tuning a parameter trading data fitting versus sparsity. For the Lassotheory to hold; this tuning parameter should be proportional to the noise level; yet the latter isoften unknown in practice. A possible remedy is to consider estimators; such as the ScaledLasso or the Concomitant Lasso; that jointly optimize over the regression parameter as wellas over the noise level; making the choice of the regularization independent from the noiselevel. However; when data from different sources with varying noise levels are observed; asit is common with multimodal datasets; new dedicated estimators are necessary.

From safe screening rules to working sets for faster Lasso-type solvers,Mathurin Massias; Alexandre Gramfort; Joseph Salmon,Abstract: Convex sparsity-promoting regularizations are ubiquitous in modern statisticallearning. By construction; they yield solutions with few non-zero coefficients; whichcorrespond to saturated constraints in the dual optimization formulation. Working set (WS)strategies are generic optimization techniques that consist in solving simpler problems thatonly consider a subset of constraints; whose indices form the WS. Working set methodstherefore involve two nested iterations: the outer loop corresponds to the definition of the WSand the inner loop calls a solver for the subproblems. For the Lasso estimator a WS is a setof features; while for a Group Lasso it refers to a set of groups. In practice; WS are generallysmall in this context so the associated feature Gram matrix can fit in memory.

Gap Safe screening rules for faster complex-valued multi-task group Lasso,Mathurin Massias; Joseph Salmon; Alexandre Gramfort,Abstract—Linear regression with sparsity-inducing penal-ties is a popular tool for high-dimensional inverse problems such as source localization. The Group Lasso is a particularchoice of penality that considers the l2; 1 norm to promote group (or block) sparsity patterns.Since no general closedform solution is available for this problem; iterative solvers areneeded.

Anomaly Detection and Localisation using Mixed Graphical Models,Romain Laby; François Roueff; Alexandre Gramfort,Abstract: We propose a method that performs anomaly detection and localisation withinheterogeneous data using a pairwise undirected mixed graphical model. The data are amixture of categorical and quantitative variables; and the model is learned over a datasetthat is supposed not to contain any anomaly. We then use the model over temporal data;potentially a data stream; using a version of the two-sided CUSUM algorithm. The proposeddecision statistic is based on a conditional likelihood ratio computed for each variable giventhe others. Our results show that this function allows to detect anomalies variable byvariable; and thus to localise the variables involved in the anomalies more precisely thanunivariate methods based on simple marginals.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1607.05974,2016,*

Sparse pairwise Markov model learning for anomaly detection in heterogeneous data,Romain Laby; Alexandre Gramfort; François Roueff; Cyrille Enderli; Larroque Alain,An important challenge in the aeronautic industry is to cope with maintenance issues of theproducts; notably detection and localization of components breakdowns. Modernequipments enjoy better recording and processing capacities; allowing the storage of alarge amount of data; on which better maintenance systems are expected to be built.Efficient probabilistic models able to represent the statistic distribution of the collectedvariables in the" normal state" of the system are needed in order to derive anomaly detectionalgorithms. Graphical models constitute a rich class of models and are natural candidates toaddress this task. This article proposes a method for learning undirected hybrid graphicalmodels from heterogeneous data. The data are heterogeneous as they include physical(quantitative) measures as well as a collection of inherently discrete variables for instance …,*,2015,*

Supramodal processing in visual learning and plasticity,Nicolas Zilber; Philippe Ciuciu; Alexandre Gramfort; Virginie van Wassenhove,Multisensory interactions are ubiquitous in cortex and question whether sensory cortices canbe distinctively supramodal ie; capable of functional selectivity irrespective of the sensorymodality of inputs (Pascual-Leone and Hamilton; 2001; Ricciardi and Pietrini; 2011; Vossand Zatorre; 2012). This suggests that visual perceptual learning could benefit fromsupramodal processing via reverse hierarchy (Ahissar and Hochstein; 2004; Proulx et al.;2012). To test this; novel stimuli were developed consisting of acoustic textures sharing thetemporal statistics of visual random dot kinematograms (RDKs). Two groups of participantswere trained in a difficult visual coherence discrimination task; with or without sounds; whilebeing recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG).

In order to apply functionalconnectivity measures such as coherency and phase locking value (PLV) to evokedresponses; which are highly non-stationary over time; the source activations and therespective complex-valued time-frequency distributions have to be estimated on a single-trial basis.

Validity of the Reynolds equation for miscible fluids in microchannels,Mathieu Colin; Thierry Colin; Julien Dambrine,Abstract In this paper; we consider asymptotic models for miscible flows in microchannels.The characteristics of the flows in microfluidics imply that usually the Hele-Shawapproximation is valid. We present asymptotic models in the Hele-Shaw regime for flows ofmiscible fluids in a channel in the case where the bottom and the top of the channels havebeen modified in two different ways. The first case concerns a flat bottom with slip boundaryconditions obtained by chemical patterning. The second one is a non-flat bottom with a non-slipping surface. We derive in both cases 2.5 D and 2D asymptotic models. We prove globalwell-posedness of the 2D model. We also prove that both approaches are asymptoticallyequivalent in the Hele-Shaw regime and we present direct 3D simulations showing that forpassive mixing strategy; the Hele-Shaw approximation is not valid anymore.,Discrete & Continuous Dynamical Systems-B,2012,*

The adjoint method of OpenMEEG for EEG and MEG with large source space,Emmanuel Olivi; Alexandre Gramfort; Théodore Papadopoulo; Maureen Clerc,In EEG or MEG; a lead field is the linear operator which associates unitary dipolar sources tothe resulting set of sensor measurements. In practise; the source space often includes over10 000 dipoles; which sometimes causes memory problems. The adjoint approachconsiders the forward problem from the viewpoint of sensors instead of sources: this dropsdown the number of linear systems to solve by two orders of magnitude. The adjointapproach is here proposed in the context of the Boundary Element Method; and itsimplementation is provided by the OpenMEEG library.,Proceedings of Biomag,2012,*
MEG/EEG source reconstruction based on Gabor thresholding in the source space,Daniel Strohmeier; Alexandre Gramfort; Jens Haueisen; Matti Hämäläinen; Matthieu Kowalski,Thanks to their high temporal resolution; source reconstruction based onMagnetoencephalography (MEG) and/or Electroencephalography (EEG) is an important toolfor noninvasive functional brain imaging. Since the MEG/EEG inverse problem is ill-posed;inverse solvers employ priors on the sources. While priors are generally applied in the timedomain; the time-frequency (TF) characteristics of brain signals are rarely employed as aspatio-temporal prior. In this work; we present an inverse solver which employs a structuredsparse prior formed by the sum of ℓ21 and ℓ1 norms on the coefficients of the Gabor TFdecomposition of the source activations. The resulting convex optimization problem issolved using a first-order scheme based on proximal operators.

P118 Brain decoding and networks studies: well beyond standard analysis in fMRI with Python and scikits. learn,Gael Varoquaux; Alexandre Gramfort; Michel Vincent; Fabian Pedregosa; Bertrand Thirion,Brain function arises from the interaction of functionally-specialized regions. However; thewell-established standard analysis framework performs statistical analysis separately oneach voxel of the functional brain images. This restriction arises from the difficulty ofperforming multivariate analysis in the small-sample limit; also known as the curse ofdimensionality. When considering full-brain images comprising many features; there is anexplosion of the number of possible statistical parameters or hypothesis to investigate.Addressing this limitation is a topic of very active research; that applies modern multivariateanalysis to fMRI data. The development of advanced fMRI data analysis often draws frommachine learning.

To cite this version,Matthieu Kowalski; Pierre Weiss; Alexandre Gramfort; Sandrine Anthoine,Abstract Starting from a practical implementation of Roth and Fisher's algorithm to solve aLasso-type problem; we propose and study the Active Set Iterative Shrinkage/ThresholdingAlgorithm (AS-ISTA). The convergence is proven by observing that the algorithm can beseen as a particular case of a coordinate gradient descent algorithm with a Gauss-Southwell-r rule. We provide experimental evidence that the proposed method can outperform FISTAand significantly speed-up the resolution of very undetermined inverse problems whenusing sparse convex priors. The proposed algorithm makes brain mapping with magneto-and electroencephalography (M/EEG) significantly faster when promoting spatially sparseand temporally smooth solutions using an ℓ1/ℓ2 norm.,*,*,*
