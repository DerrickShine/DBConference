Significance of a fragmented QRS complex versus a Q wave in patients with coronary artery disease,Mithilesh K Das; Bilal Khan; Sony Jacob; Awaneesh Kumar; Jo Mahenthiran,Background—Q waves on a 12-lead ECG are markers of a prior myocardial infarction (MI).However; they may regress or even disappear over time; and there is no specific ECG signof a non–Q-wave MI. Fragmented QRS complexes (fQRSs); which include various RSR′patterns; without a typical bundle-branch block are markers of altered ventriculardepolarization owing to a prior myocardial scar. We postulated that the presence of an fQRSmight improve the ability to detect a prior MI compared with Q waves alone by ECG. Methodsand Results—A cohort of 479 consecutive patients (mean±SD age; 58.2±13.2 years; 283males) who were referred for nuclear stress tests was studied. The fQRS included variousmorphologies of the QRS (< 120 ms); which included an additional R wave (R′) or notchingin the nadir of the S wave; or> 1 R′(fragmentation) in 2 contiguous leads; corresponding …,Circulation,2006,517

The TWEAK–Fn14 system is a critical regulator of denervation-induced skeletal muscle atrophy in mice,Ashwani Mittal; Shephali Bhatnagar; Akhilesh Kumar; Estelle Lach-Trifilieff; Sandrine Wauters; Hong Li; Denys Y Makonchuk; David J Glass; Ashok Kumar,Skeletal muscle atrophy occurs in a variety of clinical settings; including cachexia; disuse;and denervation. Inflammatory cytokines have been shown to be mediators of cancercachexia; however; the role of cytokines in denervation-and immobilization-induced skeletalmuscle loss remains unknown. In this study; we demonstrate that a single cytokine; TNF-likeweak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK); mediates skeletal muscle atrophy that occurs underdenervation conditions. Transgenic expression of TWEAK induces atrophy; fibrosis; fiber-type switching; and the degradation of muscle proteins. Importantly; genetic ablation ofTWEAK decreases the loss of muscle proteins and spared fiber cross-sectional area; musclemass; and strength after denervation. Expression of the TWEAK receptor Fn14 (fibroblastgrowth factor–inducible receptor 14) and not the cytokine is significantly increased in …,The Journal of cell biology,2010,161
Numerical simulation of natural convection heating of canned thick viscous liquid food products,ASHWINI KUMAR; M Bhattacharya; JACK BLAYLOCK,ABSTRACT Sterilization of a thick viscous liquid food in a metal can sitting in an uprightposition and heated from the side wall (T w= 394 K) only in a still retort was simulated. Theliquid had temperature dependent viscosity but constant specific heat and thermalconductivity. Equations of mass; motion and energy conservation for an axisymmetric casewere solved and plots of temperature; velocity and streamlines were provided for naturalconvection heating and isotherms compared with pure conduction contour plots. Resultsindicated that the natural convection moved the slowest heating point to the bottom center.The bottom of the can heated up slower than predicted by pure conduction heating. Themagnitude of the axial velocity was found to be of the order of 10− 5 m/sec which varied withtime and position in the can.,Journal of Food Science,1990,112
Enhancement of seed oil content by expression of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase genes,RK Jain; M Coffey; K Lai; A Kumar; SL MacKenzie,Arabidopsis thaliana was transformed with a plastidial safflower glycerol-3-phosphateacyltransferase (GPAT) and an Escherichia coli GPAT. The genes were used directly and inmodified forms with; as applicable; the plastidial targeting sequence removed; and with anendoplasmic reticulum targeting sequence added. Seeds of plants transformed using onlythe vector were indistinguishable in oil content from wild-type control plants. All other geneconstructs increased seed oil content. The unmodified safflower gene (spgpat) produced oilincreases ranging from 10 to 21%. On average; the greatest increase (+ 22%) was observedin seeds of transformants carrying the spgpat with the targeting peptide removed. The E. coliplsB gene increased seed oil content by an average of 15%.,*,2000,111

Reorientation of magnetic anisotropy in epitaxial cobalt ferrite thin films,A Lisfi; CM Williams; Long Thang Nguyen; JC Lodder; A Coleman; H Corcoran; A Johnson; P Chang; A Kumar; W Morgan,Abstract Spin reorientation has been observed in Co Fe 2 O 4 thin single crystalline filmsepitaxially grown on (100) MgO substrate upon varying the film thickness. The criticalthickness for such a spin-reorientation transition was estimated to be 300 nm. Thereorientation is driven by a structural transition in the film from a tetragonal to cubicsymmetry. At low thickness; the in-plane tensile stress induces a tetragonal distortion of thelattice that generates a perpendicular anisotropy; large enough to overcome the shapeanisotropy and to stabilize the magnetization easy axis out of plane. However; in thickerfilms; the lattice relaxation toward the cubic structure of the bulk allows the shape anisotropyto force the magnetization to be in plane aligned.,Physical Review B,2007,106
Transient temperature and velocity profiles in a canned non-Newtonian liquid food during sterilization in a still-cook retort,Ashwini Kumar; M Bhattacharya,Abstract Natural convection heating of a canned liquid food during sterilization is simulatedby solving the governing equations for continuity; momentum and energy conservation foran axisymmetric case; using a finite element code. The model liquid has constant propertiesexcept viscosity (temperature dependent and shear thinning) and density (Boussinesqapproximation). The velocity field establishes itself much more rapidly than the temperaturefield. The maximum axial velocity is of the order of 10− 4 ms− 1 because of low Grashofnumber. The coldest point is not fixed but migrates in a region that is 10–12% of the canheight from the bottom of the can and at a radial distance approximately one-half of theradius. On the basis of the computed particle path it appears that the liquid initially locatedjust below the top center is exposed to the minimum heat treatment and should be of most …,International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer,1991,103

Palliative care for prenatally diagnosed lethal fetal abnormality,Andrew CG Breeze; Christoph C Lees; Arvind Kumar; Hannah H Missfelder-Lobos; Edile M Murdoch,Diagnosis of lethal fetal abnormality raises challenging decisions for parents and clinicians.Most parents opt for termination; which may include feticide. Advances in imaging seemunlikely to lead to earlier diagnoses. Perinatal palliative care offers an alternative. Parentaldecision making and the clinical aspects of perinatal palliative care were studied after aprenatal diagnosis of lethal fetal abnormality in 20 pregnancies. 40% of parents chose tocontinue the pregnancy and pursue perinatal palliative care. Six of these eight babies wereliveborn and lived for between 1½ h and 3 weeks.,Archives of Disease in Childhood-Fetal and Neonatal Edition,2007,93
Fragmented left sided QRS in absence of bundle branch block: sign of left ventricular aneurysm,Chatla VR Reddy; Kuruvilla Cheriparambill; Barry Saul; Majesh Makan; John Kassotis; Awaneesh Kumar; Mithilesh Kumar Das,Background: A left ventricular aneurysm (LVA) occurs between 3.5% and 9.4% of all casesof acute myocardial infarction. A fragmented left sided QRS (RSRpattern or its variant RSr;rSR; or rSr) without evidence of bundle branch block (QRS duration≤ 120 ms) on the ECGmay be associated with a significant myocardial scar; which is the characteristic of a LVA.We; therefore; postulate that fragmented QRS (RSRpattern or its variant) in the left sidedleads (I; aVL; V 3 to V 6) may be a useful sign of LVA. Methods: ECGs of 110 consecutivepatients with LVA documented by left ventricular angiography (30 right anterior obliqueview) was compared with 220 patients without LVA (110 patients with and 110 patientswithout coronary artery disease (CAD)); who were evaluated for CAD by symptoms andsigns.

Genomic profiling of messenger RNAs and microRNAs reveals potential mechanisms of TWEAK-induced skeletal muscle wasting in mice,Siva K Panguluri; Shephali Bhatnagar; Akhilesh Kumar; John J McCarthy; Apurva K Srivastava; Nigel G Cooper; Robert F Lundy; Ashok Kumar,Background Skeletal muscle wasting is a devastating complication of several physiologicaland pathophysiological conditions. Inflammatory cytokines play an important role in the lossof skeletal muscle mass in various chronic diseases. We have recently reported thatproinflammatory cytokine TWEAK is a major muscle-wasting cytokine. Emerging evidencesuggests that gene expression is regulated not only at transcriptional level but also at post-transcriptional level through the expression of specific non-coding microRNAs (miRs) whichcan affect the stability and/or translation of target mRNA. However; the role of miRs inskeletal muscle wasting is unknown.

RCC is more common in men than in women (2:1); and it most often occurs in patients between the ages of 50–70 years. In all cancers thecancerous cells release particular kind of proteins (called tumour markers) and blood testsare used to detect the presence of these markers. These tumour markers nowadays are anarea of interest for oncologists who search for a possible solution in the detection andtreatment of RCC. Different kinds of biochemical and molecular markers such as ferritin;MN/CA9; apoptotic index; p53; IL-2; gamma-enolase; CD44; CD95; chromosome instabilityand loss of heterozygosity have been tested in RCC; but so far no marker fulfils one or the …,Biomarkers,2005,50
Sensitive detection method of dielectric dispersions in aqueous-based; surface-bound macromolecular structures using microwave spectroscopy,John Hefti; Alfred Pan; Amit Kumar,An approach for measuring the dispersions in the microwave regime of larger aqueous-based molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids is presented.

The absolute determination of extinction cross-sections by the use of an open resonator,AL Cullen; A Kumar,A new experimental technique for determining the extinction cross-section of an obstacle atmicrowave frequencies is described. This method does not involve the measurement offields but requires only the determination of the Q-factor of an open resonator; which can bedone very accurately. By measuring the Q-factor of the resonator with no obstacle present;and then with the obstacle in two different positions a quarter wavelength apart along theaxis of the resonator; the extinction cross-section can be deduced. The methodis; however;restricted to a class of obstacles possessing reflexion symmetry in a plane perpendicular tothe direction of propagation of the incident wave. Experimental results with brass spheres forwhich the absorption is negligible (and therefore the extinction cross-section is nearly equalto the total scattering cross-section); give excellent agreement with Mie's theory.

The formation of complexes by asymmetrical tricyclic hosts,Ashwani Kumar; Sivapathasuntharam Mogeswaran; Ian O Sutherland,Abstract The five asymmetrical tricyclic hosts (9; ac) and (10; a and b) were synthesised fromthe mono-protected diaza crown others (7a) and (7c). These hosts form 1: 1 complexes withbis-alkylammonium cations H 3 N+ CH 2 n N+ H 3. A detailed examination of the complexesof host (10a); using'H NMR spectroscopy; shows that in most cases complexation involves asingle conformation of the host molecule. Competition experiments show that the selectivityof complexation by this host involves at least two different conformations of the-CH 2 (CH 2OCH 2) 2 CH 2-bridge. Complexes formed by the analogous host (10b) involve; to a majorextent; a single conformation (17a) of the host molecule.,Tetrahedron,1986,38

To address the role of CpsA in regulation; full-length GBS CpsA and two truncatedforms of the protein were purified and analyzed for DNA-binding ability. Assaysdemonstrated that CpsA is able to bind specifically to two putative promoters within thecapsule operon with similar affinity; and full-length protein is required for specificity.Functional characterization of CpsA confirmed that the ΔcpsA strain produced less capsulethan did the wild type and demonstrated that the production of full-length CpsA or the …,Journal of bacteriology,2012,37
Comparative analysis of biclustering algorithms,Doruk Bozdağ; Ashwin S Kumar; Umit V Catalyurek,Abstract Biclustering is a very popular method to identify hidden co-regulation patternsamong genes. There are numerous biclustering algorithms designed to undertake thischallenging task; however; a thorough comparison between these algorithms is even harderto accomplish due to lack of a ground truth and large variety in the search strategies andobjectives of the algorithms. In this paper; we address this less studied; yet importantproblem and formally analyze several biclustering algorithms in terms of the biclusterpatterns they attempt to discover. We systematically formulate the requirements for well-known patterns and show the constraints imposed by biclustering algorithms that determinetheir capacity to identify such patterns. We also give experimental results from a carefullydesigned testbed to evaluate the power of the employed search strategies.

Textural evolution during accumulative roll bonding of an Al–Li alloy,S Ghosh Chowdhury; Abhijit Dutta; B Ravikumar; Amit Kumar,Abstract Texture evolution during accumulative roll bonding (ARB) of Al–Li alloy has beeninvestigated up to three passes. The grain size after third pass is∼ 450 nm. It has been seenthat the textural evolution has no similarity with the simple shear texture; the components arewell deviated from the ideal shear components. There is a destruction of texture componentsproduced after first pass during subsequent passes and that can be represented as normal β-fiber rolling texture components.,Materials Science and Engineering: A,2006,37

Structure and function of the catalytic site mutant Asp 99 Asn of phospholipase A2: absence of the conserved structural water,Amarendra Kumar; Chandra Sekharudu; Boopathy Ramakrishnan; Cynthia M Dupureur; Hongxin Zhu; Ming‐Daw Tsai; Muttaiya Sundaralingam,Abstract To probe the role of the Asp-99→ His-48 pair in phospholipase A 2 (PLA2)catalysis; the X-ray structure and kinetic characterization of the mutant Asp-99→ Asn-99(D99N) of bovine pancreatic PLA2 was undertaken. Crystals of D99N belong to the trigonalspace group P3 1 21 and were isomorphous to the wild type (WT)(Noel JP et al.; 1991;Biochemistry 30: 11801–11811). The 1.9-Å X-ray structure of the mutant showed that thecarbonyl group of Asn-99 side chain is hydrogen bonded to His-48 in the same way as thatof Asp-99 in the WT; thus retaining the tautomeric form of His-48 and the function of theenzyme. The NH 2 group of Asn-99 points away from His-48. In contrast; in the D102Nmutant of the protease enzyme trypsin; the NH 2 group of Asn-102 is hydrogen bonded toHis-57 resulting in the inactive tautomeric form and hence the loss of enzymatic activity …,Protein Science,1994,37

Reduced models of networks of coupled enzymatic reactions,Ajit Kumar; Krešimir Josić,Abstract The Michaelis–Menten equation has played a central role in our understanding ofbiochemical processes. It has long been understood how this equation approximates thedynamics of irreversible enzymatic reactions. However; a similar approximation in the caseof networks; where the product of one reaction can act as an enzyme in another; has notbeen fully developed. Here we rigorously derive such an approximation in a class ofcoupled enzymatic networks where the individual interactions are of Michaelis–Menten type.We show that the sufficient conditions for the validity of the total quasi-steady stateassumption (tQSSA); obtained in a single protein case by Borghans; de Boer and Segel canbe extended to sufficient conditions for the validity of the tQSSA in a large class of enzymaticnetworks. Secondly; we derive reduced equations that approximate the network's …,Journal of theoretical biology,2011,30

Transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 is an essential regulator of myogenic differentiation,Shephali Bhatnagar; Akhilesh Kumar; Denys Y Makonchuk; Hong Li; Ashok Kumar,Abstract Satellite cells/myoblasts account for the majority of muscle regenerative potential inresponse to injury and muscular adaptation to exercise. Although the ability to influence thisprocess would provide valuable benefits for treating a variety of patients suffering frommuscle loss; the regulatory mechanisms of myogenesis are not completely understood. Wehave tested the hypothesis that transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is animportant regulator of skeletal muscle formation. TAK1 is expressed in proliferating C2C12myoblasts; and its levels are reduced upon differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes. Invivo; TAK1 is predominantly expressed in developing skeletal muscle of young mice.However; the expression of TAK1 was significantly up-regulated in regenerating skeletalmuscle of adult mice.

Characterization of the inhibition of DNA synthesis in proliferating mink lung epithelial cells by insulin‐like growth factor binding protein‐3,Hai‐Bin Wu; Amit Kumar; Wen‐Chi Tsai; Desmond Mascarenhas; Judy Healey; Matthew M Rechler,Abstract Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) can inhibit cell growth bydirectly interacting with cells; as well as by forming complexes with IGF-I and IGF-II thatprevent their growth-promoting activity. The present study examines the mechanism ofinhibition of DNA synthesis by IGFBP-3 in CCL64 mink lung epithelial cells. DNA synthesiswas measured by the incorporation of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; using animmunocolorimetric assay. Recombinant human IGFBP-3 (rh [N109D; N172D] IGFBP-3)inhibited DNA synthesis in proliferating and quiescent CCL64 cells. Inhibition was abolishedby co-incubation of IGFBP-3 with a 20% molar excess of Leu 60-IGF-I; a biologically inactiveIGF-I analogue that binds to IGFBP-3 but not to IGF-I receptors. DNA synthesis was notinhibited by incubation with a preformed 1: 1 molar complex of Leu 60-IGF-I and IGFBP-3 …,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2000,26

Taking precautions with ACE inhibitors: A theoretical risk exists in patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis,A Kumar; M Asim; AM Davison,“The Bristol case;” in which judgment was passed last week1 will probably prove much moreimportant to the future of health care in Britain than the reforms suggested in the whitepapers. Reorganisations of the NHS come round with monotonous regularity; but changeson the wards and in surgeries are slow and often unrelated to the passing political rhetoric. 23 In contrast; the Bristol case is a once in a lifetime drama that has held the attention ofdoctors and patients in a way that a white paper can never hope to match. The case hasthrown up a long list of important issues (see box) that British medicine will take years toaddress. At the heart of the tragedy; which has been Shakespearean in its scale andstructure; is; as the GMC said;“the trust that patients place in their doctors.” That trust willnever be the same again; but that will be a good thing if we move to an active rather than …,BMJ: British Medical Journal,1998,23
The impact of intrapersonal; interpersonal; and community factors on the identity formation of young adults with cancer: a qualitative study,Anisha Rajeev Kumar; Lidia Schapira,The sample for this study included 15 young adult cancer survivors. The ages of the participantsranged from 18 to 30 years. The sample was 67% female (n = 10) and 33% male (n = 5). Thesample was 87% Caucasian (n = 13) and 13% Hispanic (n = 2). Fifty-three percent of the participantswere between ages 18 and 23 years (n = 8); and 47% of the participants were between ages24 and 30 years (n = 7). Three themes emerged from the data: intrapersonal change; interpersonalinteractions; and role and identity in the hospital and the community. As they inevitably lose controlin their lives; young adult patients seek to return to a familiar lifestyle that they consider as'normal'. The formation of a revised identity and redefined set of norms allows the patients toregain control and express their individualism … This study contributes to our knowledge ofthe experiences of young adult cancer patients and survivors.

A new efficient averaging technique for scaleup of multimillion-cell geologic models,D Li; B Beckner; A Kumar,Abstract Increased resolution in reservoir characterization is driving the need for efficientand accurate upscaling techniques for reservoir simulation on which reservoir performanceprediction relies. Unfortunately; the existing averaging methods (ie harmonic; arithmetic;power law; geometric or a combination of harmonic and arithmetic methods) are onlyapplicable under the circumstances of perfectly layered or perfectly random heterogeneitydistributions; which realistic reservoirs are not. This paper presents a new averaging methodthat improves the upscaling averaging methods for realistic reservoirs and can substitute forthe orders-of-magnitude slower performance of direct simulation methods; such as pressuresolver techniques. The new averaging method first calculates the upper and lower bounds ofthe effective properties based on the nature of geology and then employs a new …,SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition,1999,19

Shear stirrups arecompletely eliminated in the half-span of the FRC specimens. A better post-peak residualstrength response is noticed in case of all FRC beam specimens due to multiple crackingassociated with the fiber bridging action. The main parameters investigated are shearstrength; failure mechanism and displacement ductility. In the absence of shear stirrups; thepeak shear resistance and mid-span displacement of the FRC specimen 1% of …,Construction and Building Materials,2015,17
Experimental Investigation of EDM Parameters on Stainless Steel&En41b,M Dastagiri; A Hemantha Kumar,Abstract Metal removal mechanism in Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) is mainly athermal phenomenon where thermal energy is produced in plasma channel; and isdissipated though work piece; tool and dielectric. The process is mostly used in situationswhere machining of very hard materials; intricate parts; complex shapes. The aim of thiswork is to pursue the influence of four design factors current (I); voltage (V); pulse on (Ton);and duty factor (η) which are the most connected parameters to be controlled by the EDMprocess over machining specifications such as material removal rate (MRR) and tool wearrate (TWR) and characteristics of surface integrity such as average surface roughness (Ra)and the hardness (HR) and also to quantify them. In this paper the experiments have beenconducted by using full factorial design 23 with three central point in the DOE techniques …,Procedia Engineering,2014,17
Impact of Major Liberalization on Productivity: The J-Curve Hypothesis,Danish A Hashim; Ajay Kumar; Arvind Virmani,India moved from a growth rate of 3.5% per annum during the period 1950-1 to 1979-80 to agrowth rate of about 5.5% per annum thereafter because of gradual liberalization during the1980's. Following the BOP crisis of 1990-1991; India undertook a deep and wide rangingliberalization of domestic and external policies. However; the growth rate barely moved fromthe 5.5%-5.8% range; during the 1990s [Virmani (2006a; b)]. 4 Many analysts pointed to thispuzzle: How could the limited reforms of the 1980s raise the growth rate of the Indianeconomy by 2 per cent points; while the relatively massive reforms of the 1990s havevirtually no affect on the growth trend. Virmani (2005) proposed the 'J curve of liberalizationand productivity'arising from major/large trade (import) liberalization. It was argued that amajor liberalization of the kind that happened in India in the 1990s; would lead to a …,DEA Ministry of Finance Working Paper,2009,17

C3b receptor (CR1) genomic polymorphism in rheumatoid arthritis,Amit Kumar; AN Malaviya; Subrata Sinha; PS Khandekar; Kakoli Banerjee; LM Srivastava,Abstract The number of complement receptor 1 (CR1; CD35) molecules on erythrocytes isgenetically determined by two codominant alleles. The numerical expression of CR1 onerythrocytes correlates with a Hin dIII-RFLP of CR1 gene using CR1-1; a complementaryDNA probe. We have found low CR1 on erythrocytes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis(RA) in an Indian population. Low levels in RA patients may be acquired or geneticallydetermined. Fifty-two patients with RA; 48 nonrelated healthy subjects and 19consanguineous relatives of patients were genotyped. CR1 numbers on erythrocytes werequantitated by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using monoclonal anti-CR1antibody. Normal subjects and patients were followed up for a period of 6 months toevaluate the stability of their CR1 expression. The gene frequency for allele H and L (7.4 …,Immunologic research,1994,17

The data were collected with the CMS detectorat the CERN LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.2 fb− 1. The observationsare in agreement with standard model predictions. An upper limit at 95% confidence level onthe product of the production cross section and branching fraction into tau lepton pairs iscalculated as a function of the resonance mass. For the sequential standard model; thepresence of Z′ bosons decaying into tau lepton pairs is excluded for Z′ masses below 2.1TeV; extending previous limits for this final state. For the topcolor-assisted technicolor model;which predicts Z′ bosons that preferentially couple to third-generation fermions; Z′masses below 1.7 TeV are excluded; representing the most stringent limit to date.,Journal of High Energy Physics,2017,16

Antimicrobial dosing in critically ill patients with sepsis-induced acute kidney injury,Anish Kumar; Narinder Pal Singh,Abstract Severe sepsis often leads to multiple organ dysfunction syndromes (MODS) withacute kidney injury (AKI). AKI affects approximately; 35% of Intensive Care Unit patients; andmost of these are due to sepsis. Mortality rate of sepsis-induced AKI is high. Inappropriateuse of antimicrobials may be responsible for higher therapeutic failure; mortality rates; costsand toxicity as well as the emergence of resistance. Antimicrobial treatment is particularlydifficult due to altered pharmacokinetic profile; dynamic changes in patient's clinical statusand; in many cases; need for renal replacement therapy. This article aims to describe theappropriate antimicrobial dosing and reviews the factors contributing to the difficulties inestablishing precise guidelines for antimicrobial dosing in sepsis-induced AKI patients.Search strategy: Text material was collected by systematic search in PubMed; Google …,Indian journal of critical care medicine: peer-reviewed; official publication of Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine,2015,15

Acalculous cholecystitis by P. falciparum in a 3-year old child,Arvind Kumar; Amar M Taksande; KY Vilhekar,Acute cholecystitis involves inflammation of the gallbladder and can be seen withcholelithiasis (calculous) or in the absence of gallstones (acalculous). Acute acalculouscholecystitis (ACC) is rare; but important cause of cholecystitis in pediatrics1. It is estimatedthat in children; 30–50% of cholecystitis cases are acalculous; compared with 2 to 17% ofcases in adult patients2. In children ACC mainly result from antecedent bacteremia andlocalization of bacteria in the gallbladder. So the majority cases have been managed bymedical treatment alone. Gastrointestinal manifestations are common in malaria3; but theACC is extremely a rare manifestation of malaria and a very few cases have been reportedpreviously. Here we report a case of ACC attributed to severe Plasmodium falciparummalaria infection in a 3-year old child.

Platelets contain abundant miRNAs; which are linked toinflammatory responses and; thus; may play a role in atherogenesis. While diabetes mellitusaffects plasma miRNAs; no data exist on platelet miRNA profiles in this disease. Therefore;this study sought to explore the miRNA profile of platelets in patients with diabetes mellitusthat is unrelated to the presence or absence of coronary artery disease (CAD). PlateletmiRNA profiles were assessed in stable diabetic and non-diabetic patients (each n= 30); 15patients in each group had CAD. Platelet miRNA was isolated from leucocyte-depletedplatelet-rich plasma; and miRNA profiling was performed using LNA micro-array technology(miRBase18. 0; containing 1;917 human miRNAs).

Dual band coplanar capacitive coupled microstrip antennas with and without air gap for wireless applications,Veeresh G Kasabegoudar; Ajit Kumar,Abstract: This article presents the coplanar capacitive coupled probe fed microstrip antennasfor dual frequency band operation. The proposed antenna is excited by a single probe feedconnected to a capacitive strip. Of the two dual band antennas presented here; the first oneuses small air gap and the other is designed without air gap. In the first case an effort hasbeen made to reduce the height of suspended antenna. A vertical slot is placed to obtainantenna resonance at low frequency side; and also for proper impedance matching. Afterpresenting the basic geometry the second configuration (which uses no air gap) which alsooffers dual band operation at the expense of reduced bandwidth is presented. Measuredvalues fairly agree with the simulated results. Citation: VG Kasabegoudar and A.

A Study of Price-Spread of Important Foodgrains in Two Agricultural Markets of Bihar,SP Sinha; Ajoy Kumar; Jagdish Prasad; PC Pandey,The adoption of scientific technology of agricultural production by the farmers has created agreat demand for better and improved inputs in greater quantity. The investments in newtechnology largely depend upon the gains of the farming community. It has; therefore;become imperative that arrangements should exist for efficient movement of the farmers'produce to the consumers and for adequate and timely supply of superior inputs to thefarmers. In this transitional stage; the present marketing system which is outmoded;inadequate; and devoid of infrastructural facilities; has been serving as a serious constraintto the development of the agricultural sector and has resulted in unremunerative prices tothe farmers and unreasonable prices to the consumers.

Numerical analysis of aseptic processing of a non-Newtonian liquid food in a tubular heat exchanger,ASHWINI KUMAR; MRINAL BHATTACHARYA,ABSTRACT The aseptic processing of a non-Newtonian fluid in a tubular heat exchangerwith no holding section was simulated numerically. Two tube diameters (1· 270× 10-2 m and1· 905× 10-2 m); two process temperatures (410 K and 422 K) and three flow rates (1· 0; 1· 5and 2· 0L/min) were included in the analysis. A model liquid food with temperaturedependent and shear thinning viscosity was used. For each case; the length of heatingsection needed to provide a required lethality (F0) of approximately 6· 0 min on the centerline for low-acid foods was calculated.

Nickel-mediated inhibition in the glutathione-dependent protection against lipid peroxidation.,RC Srivastava; A Kumar; SK Srivastava; S Gupta; SK Hasan; M Athar,Abstract Glutathione protects liver microsomes against the rapid onset of lipid peroxidationvia a sulfhydryl dependent heat labile factor known as free radical reductase. Theadministration of nickel to mice resulted in an inhibition in the activity of free radicalreductase; and enhanced lipid peroxidation and the activity of glutathione S-transferase in adose dependent manner. The pretreatment of cyclam; a known specific chelator of nickelrestored free radical reductase and glutathione S-transferase activities and alleviated nickelmediated enhancement of lipid peroxidation. Our results indicate that nickel-mediatedinhibition in free radical reductase activity and activation of glutathione S-transferase may bedue to the interaction of nickel with sensitive-SH groups located on these proteins.,Biochemistry international,1990,14

A simple chemical approach for the deposition of Cu2ZnSnS4 thin films,Arepalli Vinaya Kumar; Nam‐Kyu Park; Eui‐Tae Kim,Abstract The direct synthesis of Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 (CZTS) on substrates by wet-chemistrymethods is of great interest for the fabrication photovoltaic thin-film solar cells. We report asimple chemical bath deposition approach to form CZTS thin films on SLG glass substrates.CZTS films were directly deposited onto glass substrate at 60 C using copper sulfate; zincsulfate heptahydrate; tin sulfate dihydrate; and sodium thiosulfate as precipitating agents.Deposition of individual metal sulfide (Cu 2 S; ZnS; and SnS 2) showed homogeneous-reaction dominant nanostructures rather than continuous thin film. By contrast; thecombination of two or three metal precursors formed continuous thin films. As-grown CZTSfilms deposited with both NH 3 and TEA showed a kesterite CZTS crystal structure. However;the absence of either NH 3 or TEA caused no crystallized CZTS film formation. The as …,physica status solidi (a),2014,13

Besides wasting valuable signal; this inefficiency also reduces spatialresolution and causes imaging volumes to exhibit significant resolution anisotropy. Wedescribe microscopic and computational techniques that address these problems bysimultaneously capturing and subsequently fusing and deconvolving multiple specimenviews. Unlike previous methods that serially capture multiple views; our approach improvesspatial resolution without introducing any additional illumination dose or compromisingtemporal resolution relative to conventional imaging.

A reduced reaction mechanism for the simulation in ethylene flare combustion,Helen H Lou; Christopher B Martin; Daniel Chen; Xianchang Li; Kyuen Li; Hitesh Vaid; Anjan Tula Kumar; Kanwar Devesh Singh; Doyle P Bean,Abstract Industrial ethylene flares are considered to be a probable major source of volatileorganic compounds (VOCs) such as formaldehyde. VOCs are chemicals that areresponsible for the formation of other atmospheric pollutants like ozone. Due to the difficultyand cost of field measurements; on-line monitoring is not practical and other methods mustbe employed. Current methodologies for calculating speciated and total VOC emissionsfrom flaring activities generally apply a simple mass reduction to the VOC species sent to theflare that does not consider the production of incomplete combustion or other intermediates.There arises a need of a speciation study for the inspection of these flare for their emission.However; most of the detailed kinetic mechanisms for the speciation study of flaring eventsare too complex; consist of large number of reactions and species; and also are …,Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy,2012,12

Immunogenic cancer cell death selectively induced by near infrared photoimmunotherapy initiates host tumor immunity,Mikako Ogawa; Yusuke Tomita; Yuko Nakamura; Min-Jung Lee; Sunmin Lee; Saori Tomita; Tadanobu Nagaya; Kazuhide Sato; Toyohiko Yamauchi; Hidenao Iwai; Abhishek Kumar; Timothy Haystead; Hari Shroff; Peter L Choyke; Jane B Trepel; Hisataka Kobayashi,Abstract Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a form of cell death that activates an adaptiveimmune response against dead-cell-associated antigens. Cancer cells killed via ICD canelicit antitumor immunity. ICD is efficiently induced by near-infrared photo-immunotherapy(NIR-PIT) that selectively kills target-cells on which antibody-photoabsorber conjugates bindand are activated by NIR light exposure. Advanced live cell microscopies showed that NIR-PIT caused rapid and irreversible damage to the cell membrane function leading to swellingand bursting; releasing intracellular components due to the influx of water into the cell. Theprocess also induces relocation of ICD bio markers including calreticulin; Hsp70 and Hsp90to the cell surface and the rapid release of immunogenic signals including ATP and HMGB1followed by maturation of immature dendritic cells. Thus; NIR-PIT is a therapy that kills …,Oncotarget,2017,11

Electrical Power Generation using piezoelectric crystal,Anil Kumar,Abstract-The usefulness of most high technology devices such as cell phones; computers;and sensors is limited by the storage capacity of batteries. In the future; these limitations willbecome more pronounced as the demand for wireless power outpaces battery developmentwhich is already nearly optimized. Thus; new power generation techniques are required forthe next generation of wearable computers; wireless sensors; and autonomous systems tobe feasible. Piezoelectric materials are excellent power generation devices because of theirability to couple mechanical and electrical properties. For example; when an electric field isapplied to piezoelectric a strain is generated and the material is deformed. Consequently;when a piezoelectric is strained it produces an electric field; therefore; piezoelectricmaterials can convert ambient vibration into electrical power.

Inclusive growth and its regional dimension,PK Nayak; Sadhan Kumar Chattopadhyay; Arun Vishnu Kumar; V Dhanya,Indian economy is elevated to a high growth path triggered mainly by macroeconomic reformsand expansion of economic activities across the sectors. However; there are some serious concernsabout a number of imbalances in the growth scenario – inter-sectoral; inter- regional andinter-state. These imbalances have definitely a serious impact on the goal of “inclusivegrowth” as envisaged in the Eleventh Five Year Plan. The study reveals that still poverty ratiois very high in the economy despite high growth. There is no significant increase in employmentin the unorganised sector of the economy. The study shows that while the contribution of theagriculture sector in the real GDP has declined fairly fast; the share of the employment in theagriculture sector has not declined to that extent. As a result; the average productivity in this sectorhas remained very low as compared to other developing countries. Since a large section …,Reserve Bank of India Occasional Papers,2010,11

Block encryption standard for transfer of data,Akhil Kaushik; Anant Kumar; Manoj Barnela,In today's world; most of the means of secure data and code storage and distribution rely onusing cryptographic schemes; such as certificates or encryption keys. Cryptographymechanisms form a basis upon which many important features of a solid security system arebuilt. It is an earliest art and it is defined as the science of writing in secret code. Basically;the cryptography algorithms are categorized into two types which are Symmetric KeyCryptography and Asymmetric Key Cryptography algorithms. The prime goal leading thedesign of an encryption algorithm must provide security against unauthorized attacks. In thispaper; a Block Encryption Standard for Transfer of data (BEST) is proposed to achieve thedifferent goals of security ie; Availability; Confidentiality and Integrity.

Discordant twins with the smaller baby appropriate for gestational age–unusual manifestation of superfoetation: A case report,Noopur Baijal; Mohit Sahni; Neeraj Verma; Amit Kumar; Nittin Parkhe; Jacob M Puliyel,Documentation of superfoetation is extremely rare in humans.; The younger foetus hasinvariably been small for gestational age (estimated from the date of the last menstrualbleed) in all the cases reported in the literature. We report a case where the younger twinwas of appropriate size for gestation. The first of twins was of 32 weeks gestation and thebaby was of appropriate size and development for the gestational age. The second twin wasof 36 weeks gestation. Gestational age was estimated with the New Ballard score; x-ray ofthe lower limbs; dental age on x-ray; and ophthalmic examination. Bleeding on implantationof the first foetus probably helped demarcate the two pregnancies. Dental age and the NewBallard score can be used to diagnose superfoetation in discordant twins; when detailed firsttrimester ultra-sound data is not available.,BMC pediatrics,2007,10

Optimization of separation of oil from oil-in-water emulsion by demulsification using different demulsifiers,VK Rajak; Inderpreet Singh; Amit Kumar; Ajay Mandal,ABSTRACT Separation of oil from oil-in-water emulsion is a major challenge in petroleumindustries during the producing and refining process. The authors investigatedcharacterization of oil-in-water emulsion and subsequently separation of oil from emulsionusing different chemical dimulsifiers. The effect of settling time; pH; temperature; anddemulsifier dosage on oil separation efficiency has been studied. It was observed that astime; temperature; and chemical dosage increased oil separation efficiency increased.Droplet size distribution of emulsions illustrated that the demulsifier could lead to thebreakup of crude oil-in-water emulsions by flocculation and coalescence. More than 98% oilseparations were observed with some demulsifiers under optimum operating conditions.,Petroleum Science and Technology,2016,9
Arginylation regulates purine nucleotide biosynthesis by enhancing the activity of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthase,Fangliang Zhang; Devang M Patel; Kristen Colavita; Irina Rodionova; Brian Buckley; David A Scott; Akhilesh Kumar; Svetlana A Shabalina; Sougata Saha; Mikhail Chernov; Andrei L Osterman; Anna Kashina,Abstract Protein arginylation is an emerging post-translational modification that targets anumber of metabolic enzymes; however; the mechanisms and downstream effects of thismodification are unknown. Here we show that lack of arginylation renders cells vulnerable topurine nucleotide synthesis inhibitors and affects the related glycine and serine biosynthesispathways. We show that the purine nucleotide biosynthesis enzyme PRPS2 is selectivelyarginylated; unlike its close homologue PRPS1; and that arginylation of PRPS2 directlyfacilitates its biological activity. Moreover; selective arginylation of PRPS2 but not PRPS1 isregulated through a coding sequence-dependent mechanism that combines elements ofmRNA secondary structure with lysine residues encoded near the N-terminus of PRPS1.This mechanism promotes arginylation-specific degradation of PRPS1 and selective …,Nature communications,2015,9

Failure detection system for photovoltaic array,*,A process for detecting and terminating a fault in a photovoltaic device is provided thatoperates in the millisecond or faster timescale. A process includes measuring a current orvoltage in each of a plurality of strings relative to a common rail. When the voltage or currentfrom a string is outside a predetermined threshold; a flag is generated indicating thepresence of a fault in the string. A control unit will detect the flag and disconnect the faultystring from the system through a switch. The use of continuously rolling averages of baselinecurrents and voltages as well as a series of measurements averaged to measure thedifference of current or voltage at each step provides a process and a fault detection systemthat does not suffer from false fault detections thereby providing a reliable and efficientsystem for detecting and terminating faults in photovoltaic devices.,*,2013,9

Using stage-and slit-scanning to improve contrast and optical sectioning in dual-view inverted light sheet microscopy (diSPIM),Abhishek Kumar; Ryan Christensen; Min Guo; Panos Chandris; William Duncan; Yicong Wu; Anthony Santella; Mark Moyle; Peter W Winter; Daniel Colón-Ramos; Zhirong Bao; Hari Shroff,Abstract Dual-view inverted selective plane illumination microscopy (diSPIM) enables high-speed; long-term; four-dimensional (4D) imaging with isotropic spatial resolution. It is alsocompatible with conventional sample mounting on glass coverslips. However; broadening ofthe light sheet at distances far from the beam waist and sample-induced scattering degradesdiSPIM contrast and optical sectioning. We describe two simple improvements that addressboth issues and entail no additional hardware modifications to the base diSPIM. First; wedemonstrate improved diSPIM sectioning by keeping the light sheet and detection opticsstationary; and scanning the sample through the stationary light sheet (rather than scanningthe broadening light sheet and detection plane through the stationary sample; as inconventional diSPIM). This stage-scanning approach allows a thinner sheet to be used …,The Biological Bulletin,2016,8
microRNA‐26a modulates inflammatory response induced by toll‐like receptor 4 stimulation in microglia,Asit Kumar; Harsharan Singh Bhatia; Antonio Carlos Pinheiro Oliveira; Bernd L Fiebich,Abstract MiRNAs; a family of small non-coding RNAs; have emerged as novel post-transcriptional regulators of numerous cellular responses. Although the involvement ofmiRNAs in the regulation of neuroinflammation in various neurological diseases has beenpreviously studied; their role in the production of inflammatory mediators during microgliaactivation is poorly understood. In this study; the role of miR-26a has been investigated inthe modulation of inflammatory response in cultured microglia. Using real-time PCR; theexpression of miR-26a was studied in toll-like receptors 4 stimulated primary mousemicroglia. miR-26a expression was found to be rapidly reduced after the stimulation of toll-like receptors 4 in microglia. Over-expression of miR-26a significantly decreased theproduction of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α and IL-6; whereas …,Journal of neurochemistry,2015,8
A domain of influence theorem for thermoelasticity with three-phase-lag model,Amit Kumar; Roushan Kumar,We establish the theory of domain of influence for a potential-temperature disturbance underthe generalized theory of thermoelasticity with three-phase-lag model. For a finite time t> 0; ithas been proved that the potential due to the displacement and the temperature fields doesnot produce any disturbances outside a bounded domain and the domain of influence isdependent on the support of load; the thermoelastic coupling constant and the phase-lagparameters. It has been shown that the domain of influence of the present case reduces tothe domain of influence for classical thermoelasticity theory and the thermoelasticity theorywith one relaxation parameter.,Journal of Thermal Stresses,2015,8

Quantitative assessment of an obstructive sleep apnea patient before and after tracheostomy: a case study,A Kumar; M Camacho; R Capasso,Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can cause severe; debilitating sleepiness and is a wellknown risk factor for cardiovascular disease [1]. Continued positive airway pressure (PAP) isusually accepted to be the first line medical management in most adults. Some patients withobstructive sleep apnea who do not improve or cannot tolerate PAP therapy may becandidates for surgical intervention. Tracheostomies were performed in the late 1960's toearly 1980's as the main surgical therapy for obstructive sleep apnea; until palataloropharyngeal; hypopharyngeal and facial skeletal surgeries [2; 3] were developed.Unfortunately; these soft tissue and skeletal surgeries are much less successful in patientswho are morbidly obese (BMI> 40).

An efficient approach for web document summarization by sentence ranking,Y Surendranadha Reddy; AP Siva Kumar,Abstract—This paper presents a summarization system that produces a summary for a givenweb document based on sentence importance measures. Most of the existing approachesfor single document summarization provide the summary by using only the informationpresent in the given document. And some approaches use the neighbour documents to getbetter document summary for the given document. In this paper we propose an efficientapproach for single document summarization which uses the two sentence importancemeasures: Frequency of the terms in the sentence and similarity to the other sentences. Thesentences are ranked according to their respective scores and the sentences with top ranksare selected for summary. The summary is evaluated by using 'recall'evaluation measure.,International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science and Software Engineering,2012,8
Suggestion for the search of H2CC in cool cosmic objects,Suresh Chandra; Amit Kumar; BK Kumthekar; MK Sharma,Abstract The transition 1 11− 1 10 at 4.829 GHz of formaldehyde (H 2 CO) was the first oneshowing the anomalous absorption; ie; the absorption against the cosmic microwavebackground. Anomalous absorption is an unusual phenomena. Structure of H 2 CC is verysimilar to that of H 2 CO and H 2 CS. Both H 2 CO and H 2 CS have already been identifiedin a number of cosmic objects. Though H 2 CC is not yet identified in the cosmic objects; wepropose that H 2 CC may be identified in cool cosmic objects through its transition 1 11− 110 at 4.85 GHz in anomalous absorption.,New Astronomy,2011,8

Saral: Devanagari Text input system in Mobile phones,Anshuman Kumar; Hemruchi Shah; Anirudha Joshi,ABSTRACT Mobile phone subscriptions in India crossed the 415 million mark in May 2009.Yet; the unavailability of a usable Indian language text input systems in mobile phonesprevent people from using simple applications like the SMS and phonebook in their ownlanguage. This paper proposes “Saral”; a new onscreen Devanagari text input system formobile phones. It follows the structure of the Devanagari script and provides a simpleinterface by grouping consonants; vowels and punctuations. When a consonant is pressed;the vowel group is replaced by a group of corresponding vowel modifiers. Audio feedbackand colour coding helps people with poor vision. The non-touch screen version of theapplication uses only five keys of the keypad for input. In usability tests; Saral was found tobe more learnable and easier to use compared to currently available solutions.,Proc. UbiComp 2009,2009,8

Simulation of left main coronary bifurcation lesions using 3D computational fluid dynamics model and its comparison with 2D,LS Binu; A Sukesh Kumar,Abstract—Coronary artery disease (CAD) is associated with plaque formation in coronaryarteries. Left main coronary bifurcation is one of the most affected regions in the humancoronary system. Atherosclerotic plaque formation occurs at the sites of branching andbifurcations where low wall shear stress (WSS); oscillating WSS; flow division; particleresidence time and stasis are found to occur. Study of blood flow through left mainbifurcation in human subjects is difficult due to the lack of adequate techniques The purposeof this work is to simulate and analyse blood flow through left main coronary bifurcationunder different stenosed conditions and to predict the possibility of further atherogenesis.Blood flow through left main coronary bifurcation is simulated and analysed using 3Dcomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) model and the results are compared with that of 2D …,Proceedings of the World Congress on Engineering,2012,7

Drug delivery through soft contact lenses: An introduction,Gourishanker Jha; Amit Kumar,Current ophthalmic drug delivery systems are insufficient; specifically eye drops; which allowapproximately 95% of the drug contained in the drops to be lost due to absorption throughthe conjunctiva or through the tear drainage. The use of soft contact lenses has beenproposed as a method to deliver drugs to the eye in an efficient manner. The contact lensesrestrict the drug from being lost to tear drainage by releasing the drug into two tear layers oneither side of the contact lens; where it ultimately diffuses into the eye. By using loaded softcontact lenses; continuous drug release for extended period is possible. This paper focuseson the different methods of drug loading used throughout a polymer hydrogel.,Chronicles of young Scientists,2011,7
A framework for distributing scalable content over peer-to-peer networks,Michael Eberhard; Amit Kumar; Silvano Mignanti; M Uitto; R Petrocco,Abstract—Peer-to-Peer systems are nowadays a very popular solution for multimediadistribution; as they provide significant cost benefits compared with traditional server-clientdistribution. Additionally; the distribution of scalable content enables the consumption of thecontent in a quality suited for the available bandwidth and the capabilities of the end-userdevices. Thus; the distribution of scalable content over Peerto-Peer network is a very actualresearch topic.

A fault-tolerant backbone network architecture targeting time-critical communication for avionic WDM LANs,Dexiang Wang; Arvindhan Kumar; Madhan Sivakumar; Janise Y McNair,In this paper; we focus on the design and analysis of a torus-based backbone architecturewhich targets to meet both the low delay and high reliability requirements of avionic time-critical communications. Reliable optical connection between arbitrary source-destinationpairs is proposed by enabling four non-overlapping lightpaths between the source anddestination; which makes the network tolerant to at least three arbitrary link failures withoutlosing connectivity. A greedy algorithm is introduced to set up the four non-overlappinglightpaths with the aim of maximizing two-terminal reliability (TTR); as well as minimizingsignal attenuation and propagation delay. A wavelength assignment and reuse (WAR)method is used to reduce by half the wavelength requirement for all-to-all communication ina case study of 4 times 4 torus.

To date most of the attentionhas been focused on EGFR and ErbB2. We have taken a systems approach tounderstanding ErbB signaling and built a comprehensive computational model of thepathway. Simulations revealed ErbB3 as an ultra-sensitive node in the ErbB pathway andsuggested it as a better target for therapeutic intervention. Historically; ErbB3 has not beenconsidered as an attractive target because of its impaired kinase activity and low expressionin tumors although recent publications suggest a key role in promoting resistance to EGFRand ErbB2 targeted therapeutics. Human monoclonal IgG2 antibodies against ErbB3 werethen developed and tested in multiple orthogonal assays for the ability to modulate ErbB3activity and one candidate; MM-121; was chosen to move forward into pre-clinical testing …,*,2008,7

Characterizations of surfactant synthesized from Jatropha oil and its application in enhanced oil recovery,Sudhir Kumar; Amit Kumar; Ajay Mandal,Abstract Surfactants are frequently used in chemical enhanced oil recovery (EOR) as itreduces the interfacial tension (IFT) to an ultra-low value and also alter the wettability of oil-wet rock; which are important mechanisms for EOR. However; most of the commercialsurfactants used in chemical EOR are very expensive. In view of that an attempt has beenmade to synthesis an anionic surfactant from non-edible Jatropha oil for its application inEOR. Synthesized surfactant was characterized by FTIR; NMR; dynamic light scattering;thermogravimeter analyser; FESEM; and EDX analysis. Thermal degradability study of thesurfactant shows no significant loss till the conventional reservoir temperature. The ability ofthe surfactant for its use in chemical EOR has been tested by measuring its physicochemicalproperties; viz.; reduction of surface tension; IFT and wettability alteration.

In our review of more than 20epidemiologic studies of major infectious diseases; including tuberculosis; community-acquired pneumonia and sepsis; obesity was associated with better outcomes. A cause-and-effect relationship between over-nutrition and survival with infection is suggested by theresults of two preliminary studies of infections in mice; where high-fat feeding for 8–10 wksprovided much better outcomes. These better outcomes are reminiscent of many recentstudies of “sterile” noninfectious medical and surgical conditions where outcomes for obesepatients were better than for their thinner counterparts; this was given the tag “obesityparadox.” Turning to the history of medicine and biological evolution; we hypothesize that …,Molecular Medicine,2016,6

Piecewise linear and boolean models of chemical reaction networks,Alan Veliz-Cuba; Ajit Kumar; Krešimir Josić,Abstract Models of biochemical networks are frequently complex and high-dimensional.Reduction methods that preserve important dynamical properties are therefore essential fortheir study. Interactions in biochemical networks are frequently modeled using Hill functions(x^ n/(J^ n+ x^ n) xn/(J n+ xn)). Reduced ODEs and Boolean approximations of such modelnetworks have been studied extensively when the exponent nn is large. However; while thecase of small constant JJ appears in practice; it is not well understood. We provide amathematical analysis of this limit and show that a reduction to a set of piecewise linearODEs and Boolean networks can be mathematically justified.

Active crosstalk cancel for high-density inductive inter-chip wireless communication,Amit Kumar; Noriyuki Miura; Muhammad Muqsith; Tadahiro Kuroda,A 1.2 Gb/s/channel inductive inter-chip wireless interconnect is reported in ISSCC 2004. Forhigh data bandwidth in this scheme; high density inductor layout is required; but closerlayout of inductors on chip also increases the crosstalk between channels. In this paper atheory is introduced to reduce the crosstalk between wireless channels based on the inversematrix; which in turn helps in reducing the pitch of the inductor layout. The simulations weredone for a communication distance of 15/spl mu/m and for varying inductor pitch layout from10/spl mu/m to 50/spl mu/m. Simulink simulations show that for the same signal to noise ratio(SNR) the bit error rate (BER) can be improved for the given pitch. Circuit implementationsare proposed and Spice simulations show that the pitch of the inductor layout can bedecreased only with the help of change in layout from 25/spl mu/m to 15/spl mu/m for …,VLSI Design; 2006.

Using light-sheet fluorescence microscopy to address the challenges associatedwith functional imaging at this developmental stage; we recorded calcium dynamics inmuscles and neurons and developed analysis strategies to relate activity and movement. Inmuscles; we found that the initiation of twitching was associated with a spreading calciumwave in a dorsal muscle bundle. Correlated activity in muscle bundles was linked with earlytwitching and eventual coordinated movement. To identify neuronal correlates of behavior;we monitored brainwide activity with subcellular resolution and identified a particularlyactive cell associated with muscle contractions.

Greenhouse gas emissions from hydropower reservoirs,Amit Kumar; MP Sharma,Abstract Hydropower reservoirs are found to emit about 35-70 times less greenhouse gas(GHG) compared to thermal power plants. The emissions not only depend on the type of eco-region in which the reservoir is located but also on the reservoir characteristics and waterquality parameters. This paper reports the results of the impact of reservoir parameters andwater quality characteristics on GHG emission from tropical; temperate and borealreservoirs. For this purpose; linear equations are developed but the regression coeffi cient isfound very poor. The R 2 range for CO 2 is 5× 10-5 to 0.36 for tropical; temperate and borealreservoirs and the R 2 4 is 0.004-0.244 respectively; which is far lower than 0.90; and cannotbe accurately used for prediction.

An efficient GEM model for image inpainting using a new directional sparse representation: Discrete Shearlet Transform,R Gomathi; A Vincent Antony Kumar,In this paper; we present a novel Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for automaticcolor image inpainting using a new discrete multi scale directional sparse representationcalled the Discrete Shearlet Transform (DST). It is now acknowledged that the traditionalwavelets are not very effective when dealing the multi dimensional signals havingdistributed discontinuities such as edges. To achieve a more efficient representation onehas to use basis elements with much higher directional sensitivity. Using a ShearletTransform combines the power of multi scale methods with a unique ability to capture thegeometry of multidimensional data and is optimally efficient in representing images withedges. The inpainting can be viewed as an interpolation or estimation problem with missingdata. Towards this goal; we propose the idea of using Expectation Maximization (EM) …,Computational Intelligence and Computing Research (ICCIC); 2010 IEEE International Conference on,2010,5

Anomalous absorption in thioformaldehyde,Suresh Chandra; Amit Kumar; MK Sharma,Absorption against the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB); called the anomalousabsorption; is an unusual phenomenon. The transition 111–110 at 4.829 GHz offormaldehyde (H2CO) was the first one showing the anomalous absorption. The c-C3H2 isthe second molecule showing anomalous absorption through its transition 220–211 at21.590 GHz. Structure of thioformaldehyde (H2CS) is very similar to that of the H2CO.Therefore; we have investigated about the physical conditions under which the transition111–110 at 1.0465 GHz of H2CS would be found in anomalous absorption in cool cosmicobjects. As in case of H2CO; the anomalous absorption of 111–110 of H2CS is foundsensitive to the relative collisional rates and it requires that the collisional rate for thetransition 111–211 must be smaller than that for the transition 110–212.,New Astronomy,2010,5

Continuous prewarping of time for multiuser interactive virtual environments,Paul M Sharkey; Aparna Kumar,Dynamic multi-user interactions in a single networked virtual environment suffer from abruptstate transition problems due to communication delays arising from network latency--anaction by one user only becoming apparent to another user after the communication delay.This results in a temporal suspension of the environment for the duration of the delay--thevirtual worldhangs'--followed by an abrupt jump to make up for the time lost due to the delayso that the current state of the virtual world is displayed. These discontinuities appearunnatural and disconcerting to the users. This paper proposes a novel method of warpingtimes associated with users to ensure that each user views a continuous version of thevirtual world; such that no hangs or jumps occur despite other user interactions. Objectspassed between users within the environment are parameterized; not by real time; but by …,Telemanipulator and Telepresence Technologies II,1995,5

Here; we discovered that Ate1-knockout (KO) embryonic fibroblasts exhibittumorigenic properties; including abnormally rapid contact-independent growth; reducedability to form cell–cell contacts and chromosomal aberrations. Ate1-KO fibroblasts can formlarge colonies in Matrigel and exhibit invasive behavior; unlike wild-type fibroblasts.Furthermore; Ate1-KO cells form tumors in subcutaneous xenograft assays inimmunocompromised mice. Abnormal growth in these cells can be partially rescued byreintroduction of stably expressed specific Ate1 isoforms; which also reduce the ability ofthese cells to form tumors.

Measurement of characteristic impedance of Silicon fiber sheet (Ceramic foam) based read out strips panel,Manoj Kumar Singh; Venktesh Singh; N Marimuthu; VS Subrahmanyam; Abhishek Kumar,Resistive Plate Chambers are parallel plate fast gaseous detectors built using electrodes ofhigh resistivity (1012 ohm-cm) such as glass or Bakelite. Both electrodes are connected tothe positive and negative polarities of the high voltage power supply. When a chargedparticle such as muon passes through the chamber it ionizes the gas and charges movetowards opposite electrodes. The electrodes are transparent to the signal; which is finallypicked up by external metallic strips after a small but precise time delay. Regarding theelectrical properties; it will be ideal to have the characteristic impedance of the strips ofreadout panel match with the front-end electronics so that signal reflections are minimized.Another important consideration is the attenuation in the pickup strips; which should beminimized as well.,DAE Symp.

Digital arithmetic coding with AES algorithm,Archek Praveen Kumar; Deepika Bansal,ABSTRACT The paper presents the security and compression of data by Digital Arithmeticcoding with AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm. basic research is toarithmetically encode the data first and then encrypt it by using AES algorithm then transmitsthe code. At the receiving end the data is decrypted and decoded to produce the user data.The paper has an advantage of encoding/decoding and compression of data at a time. Theinput data size is of 128 bits or 256 bits in AES; so the idea is to compress the data beforeencryption by arithmetic coding. For encoding/decoding use digital arithmetic coding and forencryption/decryption we use AES algorithm. The arithmetic coding is similar to Huffmancoding they both achieve their compression by reducing the average number of bits requiredto represent the symbol.

Spin relaxation in silicon nanowires,Ashish Kumar; Md Akram; Satya Gopal Dinda; Bahniman Ghosh,We simulate spin polarized transport of electrons along a silicon nanowire and along asilicon two dimensional channel. Spin density matrix calculations are used along with thesemi-classical Monte Carlo approach to model spin evolution along the channel. Spindephasing in silicon is caused due to Rashba Spin Orbit Interaction (structural inversionasymmetry) which gives rise to D'yakonov-Perel'relaxation. We show that Spin relaxationlength in a silicon nanowire is an order of magnitude higher than that in a 2-D siliconchannel. The effect of driving electric field on spin relaxation is also investigated. Theseresults obtained are essential for design of spintronics based devices.,Journal of Computational and Theoretical Nanoscience,2012,4

Influence of Binary Oxidant (FeCl3: APS) Ratio on the Spectroscopic and Microscopic Properties of Poly (2; 5-Dimethoxyaniline),Rajiv K Singh; Amit Kumar; Khushboo Agarwal; Deepshikha Dwivedi; Keadar N Sood; Ramadhar Singh,ABSTRACT Poly (2; 5-dimethoxyaniline)(PDMA) has been synthesized by chemicaloxidative polymerization technique using varying ratio (wt/wt) of binary oxidants; ferricchloride (FeCl3) and ammonium persulfate (APS). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) andultraviolet-visible (Uv-vis) spectroscopic investigations provide the evidence of the presenceof both benzenoid and quinoid ring units. The thermal analysis and structuralcharacterization data suggests that the oxidant ratio greatly controls the molecular orderingin PDMA. Surface morphology shows the existence of both amorphous and crystallinedomains wherein the crystalline domain size depends on the oxidant ratio. The dcconductivity (σdc) of PDMA is also a function of binary oxidant ratio and at FeCl3: APS (50:50); it increases by two orders of magnitude.

Displacement and stress fields in a poroelastic half-space due to a concentrated force,AMIT Kumar; KULDIP Singh; MUKESH KUMAR Sharma,Abstract Following the procedure of Mindlin and Cheng (1952); the closed-form analyticalexpressions for the displacements; stresses and pore pressure induced by a single force ofarbitrary orientation located in a homogeneous; isotropic poroelastic half-space areobtained. The corresponding stresses have the property that traction vanishes on the planeboundary of the half space. Formulae for calculating the displacement vector and thestresses are obtained by using the Galerkin vector approach. It has been verified that thedisplacements and stresses in an elastic half-space under the action of concentrated forcescan be calculated by using our results after replacing some constants.,International Journal of Engineering Science and Technology (IJEST),2012,4

Spin dephasing in III-V nanowires,Ashish Kumar; Bahniman Ghosh,Abstract: We use semiclassical Monte Carlo approach to investigate spin polarized transportin InP and InSb nanowires. Spin dephasing in III-V channels is caused due to D'yakonov-Perel (DP) relaxation and due to Elliott-Yafet (EY) relaxation. The DP relaxation occursbecause of bulk inversion asymmetry (Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction) and structuralinversion asymmetry (Rashba spin-orbit interaction). The injection polarization directionstudied is that along the length of the channel. The dephasing rate is found to be very strongfor InSb as compared to InP which has larger spin dephasing lengths. The ensembleaveraged spin components vary differently for both InP and InSb nanowires. The steadystate spin distribution also shows a difference between the two III-V nanowires.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1106.4618,2011,4

Amplitude and phase study of sub-ionospheric VLF radio signal receiver at Suva,Abhikesh Kumar,Very Low Frequency (VLF) radio waves (3 to 30 kHz) are guided by the spherical waveguideformed by the Earth's surface and the D-region of the ionosphere; known as Earth-ionosphere waveguide (EIWG). The propagation has relatively low attenuation resulting inthe signals measurable at large distances around the Earth. The amplitudes and phases ofthe signals received at any point depend on the electrical conductivity of the ionosphere aswell as the Earth under the propagation path. The observed properties of VLF signals can beused to study the localized disturbances in the electron density of the lower ionosphere andsubionospheric VLF transmission. The major variations in the received amplitudes andphases of VLF transmissions are apparent from the observed diurnal variations of the signalstrengths; which reproduce their forms over the days.

Pretreatment with hydrotubation in infertility management improves pregnancy rates,Pratibha Saini; Antriksh Kumar,Abstract Introduction: Tubal disease is the major cause of infertility. Hysterosalphingography(HSG) is a first-line diagnostic tool for assessing the status of a tube. It is a relatively easyprocedure which provides a measure of tubal diameter; locates tubal occlusion andidentifies pathologies such as hydrosalpings; salpingitis isthmica nodosa. We hypothesizethat hydrotubation; which is a simple effective noninvasive procedure for tubal factor;increases the pregnancy rate. Methods: Two hundred fifty patients with normal andabnormal HSG findings were included in the study. The ages of the patients were 24 to 35years and duration of infertility 5 to 9 years. All patients were routinely investigated withhormonal profile; HSG and semen analysis by known procedures. Tuberculosis was alsoexcluded in all patients.

Inhibition of neuroinflammation by thymoquinone requires activation of Nrf2/ARE signalling,Ravikanth Velagapudi; Asit Kumar; Harsharan S Bhatia; Abdelmeneim El-Bakoush; Izabela Lepiarz; Bernd L Fiebich; Olumayokun A Olajide,Abstract Thymoquinone is an antioxidant phytochemical that has been shown to inhibitneuroinflammation. However; little is known about the potential roles of intracellularantioxidant signalling pathways in its anti-inflammatory activity. The objective of this studywas to elucidate the roles played by activation of the Nrf2/ARE antioxidant mechanisms inthe anti-inflammatory activity of this compound. Thymoquinone inhibited lipopolysaccharide(LPS)-induced neuroinflammation through interference with NF-κB signalling in BV2microglia. Thymoquinone also activated Nrf2/ARE signalling by increasing nuclearlocalisation; DNA binding and transcriptional activity of Nrf2; as well as increasing proteinlevels of HO-1 and NQO1. Suppression of Nrf2 activity through siRNA or with the use oftrigonelline resulted in the loss of anti-inflammatory activity by thymoquinone. Taken …,International immunopharmacology,2017,3

Nuclear factor kappa B: a potential target to persecute head and neck cancer,Javadi Monisha; Nand Kishor Roy; Devivasha Bordoloi; Amit Kumar; Ramesh Golla; Jibon Kotoky; Ganesan Padmavathi; Ajaikumar B Kunnumakkara,Despite the consistent and significant advancements made in the treatment of head andneck cancer (HNSCC); it remains one of the most devastating cancers globally killingapproximately 350;000 people every year. Both clinical and basic research revealed that thetranscription factor NF-ΚB; is constitutively expressed in HNSCC and this persistentexpression of NF-ΚB is the root cause of this disease resulting in cancer cell proliferation;survival; invasion; metastases and poor survival of patients. Activation of NF-ΚB is pragmaticin most of the premalignant dysplastic lesions indicating it as an early episode in malignanttransformation of this disease. Therefore; therapies designed to inhibit or block the activity ofNF-ΚB; would result in downregulation of key cellular processes involved in tumor growthand its dissemination to metastatic sites. In addition; substantial evidences have revealed …,Current drug targets,2017,3

Communication—indentation of Li-ion pouch cell: Effect of material homogenization on prediction of internal short circuit,A Kumar; Sergiy Kalnaus; Srdjan Simunovic; S Gorti; Srikanth Allu; John A Turner,Abstract We performed finite element simulations of spherical indentation of Li-ion pouchcells. Our model fully resolves different layers in the cell. The results of the layer resolvedmodels were compared to the models available in the literature that treat the cell as anequivalent homogenized continuum material. Simulations were carried out for different sizesof the spherical indenter. We show that calibration of a failure criterion for the cell in thehomogenized model depends on the indenter size; whereas in the layer-resoled model;such dependency is greatly diminished.,Journal of The Electrochemical Society,2016,3

Gating techniques for 6T SRAM cell using different modes of FinFET,Deeksha Anandani; Anurag Kumar; VS Kanchana Bhaaskaran,This paper proposes the design of incorporating fine grain and coarse grain gatingtechniques for the SRAM cell and SRAM array respectively. Independent gate FinFET; tiedgate FinFET and independent gate FinFET with pass gate feedback are employed for powergating the 6T SRAM cell. The leakage power; stability (SNM) and delay comparisons havebeen made. The simulations are carried out using Cadence® Virtuoso tools; employing the32nm Predictive Technology Model (PTM) files for the MOS devices and 32nm BPTM filesfor the FinFETs. The results validate the advantage of using power gating for reduced staticpower dissipation. The independent gate FinFET based 6T SRAM cell using pass gatefeedback incurs 2.23 uW of power during the hold operation; as against the comparativelynegligible power dissipation of 27.67 pW with the power gating.,Advances in Computing; Communications and Informatics (ICACCI); 2015 International Conference on,2015,3

Low and high frequency instabilities in an explosion-generated-plasma and possibility of wave triplet,OP Malik; Sukhmander Singh; Hitendra K Malik; A Kumar,Abstract An explosion-generated-plasma is explored for low and high frequency instabilitiesby taking into account the drift of all the plasma species together with the dust particleswhich are charged. The possibility of wave triplet is also discussed based on the solution ofdispersion equation and synchronism conditions. High frequency instability (HFI) and lowfrequency instability (LFI) are found to occur in this system. LFI grows faster with the higherconcentration of dust particles; whereas its growth rate goes down if the mass of the dust ishigher. The ion and electron temperatures affect its growth in opposite manner and theelectron temperature causes this instability to grow. In addition to the instabilities; a simplewave is also observed to propagate; whose velocity is larger for larger wave number;smaller mass of the dust and higher ion temperature.,Journal of Theoretical and Applied Physics,2015,3

Least Squares Algorithms for Time of Arrival Based Mobile Source Localization and Time Synchronization in Wireless Sensor Networks,Anita Panwar; Anish Kumar; Sh Ashok Kumar,ABSTRACT Accurate source localization and synchronization is of considerable interest inwireless communications. Localization and synchronization are two important issues whichare traditionally treated separately in communication systems and wireless sensor networks.In this paper; we present a unified framework to solve these two problems at the same timejointly. Two algorithms are developed for accurate mobile source localization and timesynchronization using the time-of-arrival measurements of the signal. The first algorithm;Least Square (LS) estimator; is derived for joint location and timing estimation which is morecomputationally efficient. The second algorithm is Weighted Least Square for improvingestimation accuracy is proposed. For the joint source localization and time synchronizationthe Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is also derived.,Proceedings published by International lournal of Computer Applications (IjCA) International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks CSI-COMNET-2011,2011,3

Capacitors voltage balancing in half bridge inverter for low switching frequency applications,Amit Kumar; Rajesh Gupta,This paper analyzes the two commonly used current control methods for high power; lowswitching frequency applications involving half bridge inverter. First; the problem of voltagebalancing of two DC link capacitors in the half bridge inverter has been discussed. The twocurrent control methods used for the comparison are hysteresis current control and rampcomparison current control methods. It is shown that the hysteresis current controller leads tothe situation of unbalancing of the DC link voltages at low switching frequency operation ofthe switches. This problem can be eliminated when the switches of the inverter are operatedat fixed switching frequency using ramp comparison control method and it is shown that thiscurrent control method has self balancing capability. The results are verified usingPSCAD/EMTDC simulation results and validated through an experimental model using …,Power Electronics; Drives and Energy Systems (PEDES) & 2010 Power India; 2010 Joint International Conference on,2010,3

Initial results on solar flare effect on 24.8 kHz subionospheric propagation over long path to Suva,Abhikesh Kumar; Sushil Kumar,Solar flares are explosions on the surface of the sun that release a large amount ofelectromagnetic energy in the form of radio waves at the long wavelength end; throughoptical emission to X-rays at the short wavelength end. It has long been known that the solarflares; particularly associated with X-rays having wavelengths typically of tenths of nm;penetrate the lower region of the ionosphere (D-region) and increase the electron densityvia extra ionization (Mitra 1974). The normal unperturbed daytime D-region from which VeryLow Frequency (VLF) signals are reflected is maintained mainly by Lyman-α radiation(121.6 nm) from the sun that partially ionizes the minor neutral constituent nitric oxide (atheight around 70 km). Under normal conditions; the solar X-ray flux is too small to be asignificant source for ionizing the D-region. However; when solar flare occurs; the X-ray …,The South Pacific Journal of Natural and Applied Sciences,2008,3

An ECO technique for removing crosstalk violations in clock networks,Amit Kumar; Krishnendu Chakrabarty; Chunduri Rama Mohan,Crosstalk noise in the clock network of digital circuits is often detected late in the designcycle; sometimes as late as after first silicon. It is therefore necessary to fix crosstalkviolations in the clock tree by making minimal design changes and maintaining skewbounds. We propose a novel approach for making engineering change order (ECO)changes in the clock network to remove crosstalk violations. A two-pronged approach basedon wire-translocation and rerouting is presented. Wire translocation; ie; changing the trackfor a net to another free track with less crosstalk; eliminates a large percentage of removableviolations. A linear time procedure to check if a violation is removable by translocation isdeveloped. Next; an efficient rerouting method based on an incremental loci-findingalgorithm is combined with linear time dynamic programming approach to eliminate the …,VLSI Design; 2007.

Molecule-based modeling of gasoil fluid catalytic cracking,Ankush Kumar; Michael T Klein,Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) is a major refinery process designed to upgrade heavy andless valuable petroleum products to gasoline and lighter products. The feedstock for theFCC process ranges from light gas oils to heavy hydro-treated resids. The complexity of thefeedstock; and the associated analytical chemistry and computational obstacles; helpedshape early FCC modeling approaches (2.3. 7). The traditional need for easily deployedreaction models led to the formulation of simple; lumped kinetic models. Lumped modelsoften fail to capture the complex FCC chemistry and as a result are specific to the feedstock;the catalyst used and the operating conditions. Additionally; lumped models do not give thedetailed product distribution required for process design and optimization.

The value of the world's wetlands is increasinglyreceiving due attention as they contribute to a healthy environment in many ways. Theyretain water during dry periods; thus keeping the water table high and relatively stable.During periods of ﬂooding; they mitigate ﬂoods and trap suspended solids and attachednutrients. Thus; streams ﬂowing into lakes by way of wetland areas will transport fewersuspended solids and nutrients to the lakes than if they ﬂow directly into the lakes.

Particular emphasis is placed onexamining the dynamics of collisions leading to projectile-like fragment exit channels. Ageneral exploration of the reaction systematics reveals the binary dissipative character of thecollisions and a hierarchy effect similar to that seen for heavier systems. Investigation of thesubset of events characterized by a total α-conjugate mass (α particles plus α-conjugatefragments) equal to 40 and atomic number equal to 20 reveal a dominance of α-conjugateexit channels. The hierarchy effect for these channels leads to the production of α-clusteredneck structures with potentially exotic geometries and properties.,Physical Review C,2017,2

A hybrid-radix approach for efficient implementation of unfolded CORDIC architectures for FPGA platforms,Burhan Khurshid; Roohie Naz Mir; Animesh Kumar; Shatish Kumar,CORDIC algorithms have long been used in digital signal processing for calculatingtrigonometric; hyperbolic; logarithmic and other transcendental functions. The algorithmrequires only shift and add operations and this simplicity encourages its implementation inhardware. Traditional CORDIC architectures have focused on radix-2 implementationsbecause of their higher accuracy. However these architectures are slow; requiring a lot ofiterations to converge to a given solution. Radix-4 and higher radix architectures have beenproposed to speed up the process by reducing the number of iterations; but they suffer frompoor accuracy. In this paper a hybrid-radix approach to CORDIC implementation isproposed. By using this approach the algorithm can be implemented with higher speed;lower power and lesser area utilization and at the same time a good accuracy can be …,Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN); 2014 International Conference on,2014,2
Resolving the paradox between IEEE 802.15. 4 and Zigbee,Agrata Kumar; Anjali Sharma; Kusum Grewal,IEEE 802.15. 4 is a standard maintained by the IEEE 802.15 group which specifies thephysical layer and media access control for low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs).

4 Wheel Steering Systems (4WAS),Sachin Saxena; Vinay Kumar; Sarabjeet Singh Luthra; Alok Kumar,This paper is all about 4-wheel steering system rather than 2-wheel steering as inconventional vehicles running in INDIA. A 4-wheel steering is completely different from a 4-wheel drive (in which each wheel is given power rather than to 2 wheels). A 4-wheelsteering system is superior to a 2-wheel steering system. It reduces the turning radius aswell as the space required for turning. It also enables to change road lane while driving evenat high speed. This paper is under research in a university of Egypt. In this project we want todevelop an electric car with the wheel rotation up to 90º for the cause–the parking problemfaced in metro cities. This car will be a special utility vehicle which can run on 2-wheelsteering as well as on 4-wheel steering.,International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Robotics Research,2014,2

Semiclassical Monte Carlo simulation studies of spin dephasing in InP and InSb nanowires,Ashish Kumar; MW Akram; Bahniman Ghosh,We use semiclassical Monte Carlo approach to investigate spin polarized transport in InPand InSb nanowires. D'yakonov-Perel (DP) relaxation and Elliott-Yafet (EY) relaxation arethe two main relaxation mechanisms for spin dephasing in III-V channels. The DP relaxationoccurs because of bulk inversion asymmetry (Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction) andstructural inversion asymmetry (Rashba spin-orbit interaction). The injection polarizationdirection studied is that along the length of the channel. The dephasing rate is found to bevery strong for InSb as compared to InP which has larger spin dephasing lengths. Theensemble averaged spin components vary differently for both InP and InSb nanowires. Thesteady state spin distribution also shows a difference between the two III-V nanowires.,AIP Advances,2012,2

Test before you stop,Abhishek Kumar; David H Roberts,This commendable work by O'Riordan et al 1 will undoubtedly be an invaluable guide forsurgeons. However; due to variable individual response to clopidogrel; 2 the decision tostop treatment with clopidogrel should be based on the level of platelet inhibition. Suchpatients can be identified and monitored using simple bedside assay. 3 This variability in theantiplatelet activity of clopidogrel can be attributed to genetic polymorphism. 4 Thus; thosewith low responses to clopidogrel whose bleeding risks are minimal but who are at higherrisk of further major cardiovascular events 5 can be offered surgery early; and potentiallyfatal cardiovascular complications can be avoided.Due to the problems related to variableresponses to clopidogrel; novel P2Y12 antagonists; like prasugrel; ticagrelor; and cangrelor;with more potent antiplatelet effects are emerging.

Extending moodle to support offline assessments,Archana Rane; Akshay Kumar; Harmeet Saini; M Sasikumar; Raintree Marg,Abstract—Conducting objective-type exams using online testing tools is becoming popularin academics as well as corporate. This increasing popularity is due to the various benefitsoffered by such tools such as reduced time and effort due to automated evaluation ofobjective-type questions; ease in analysis of exam data stored in electronic form; availabilityof sophisticated reports and statistics; auto-updation in the grade book; question bankingfacility; etc. But; often objective-exams are still conducted in an offline mode–using OMRsheets for example; mainly due to infrastructure constraints; lack of technical support;security and recovery concerns; etc. It will be useful if such offline exams can also utilize thebenefits offered by an online testing tool. However most of the existing online testingsystems provide support for only completely “online” exams.

Equivalence between external electric field with temperature and supersaturation in nucleation process,N Singh; Anand Kumar,The equivalence between critical temperature corresponding to unit nucleation rate per unitvolume has been studied with external electric field applied to water vapours. It has beenfound that an external electric field of 1 esu with different supersaturation ratio is equivalentto several orders of temperature. The high electric field is found to correspond with lowertemperatures for critical nucleation. The theory of droplet growth in presence of externalelectric field has been applied to water vapour condensation. The radius of critical nucleus isfound to depend on electric field and relaxation time. Further in presence of electric field;Gibb's free energy of formation of water molecule changes for a critical nucleus and is foundto be much less than that in absence of the electric field; but equilibrium concentration ofnuclei is very much larger.,*,2003,2

Morphological segmentation inside-out,Ryan Cotterell; Arun Kumar; Hinrich Schütze,Abstract Morphological segmentation has traditionally been modeled with non-hierarchicalmodels; which yield flat segmentations as output. In many cases; however; propermorphological analysis requires hierarchical structure—especially in the case of derivationalmorphology. In this work; we introduce a discriminative joint model of morphologicalsegmentation along with the orthographic changes that occur during word formation. To thebest of our knowledge; this is the first attempt to approach discriminative segmentation with acontext-free model. Additionally; we release an annotated treebank of 7454 English wordswith constituency parses; encouraging future research in this area.,Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2016,1

Channel Estimation in OFDM Systems,Anand Kumar; Ranjan Kumar,ABSTRACT Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) provides an effective andlow complexity means of eliminating intersymbol interference for transmission overfrequency selective fading channels. This technique has received a lot of interest in mobilecommunication research as the radio channel is usually frequency selective and timevariant. In OFDM system; modulation may be coherent or differential. Channel stateinformation (CSI) is required for the OFDM receiver to perform coherent detection or diversitycombining; if multiple transmit and receive antennas are deployed. In practice; CSI can bereliably estimated at the receiver by transmitting pilots along with data symbols. Pilot symbolassisted channel estimation is especially attractive for wireless links; where the channel istime-varying.

Analysis of frequency shifting in seismic signals using Gabor-Wigner transform,Roshan Kumar; P Sumathi; Ashok Kumar,Abstract A hybrid time-frequency method known as Gabor-Wigner transform (GWT) isintroduced in this paper for examining the time-frequency patterns of earthquake damagedbuildings. GWT is developed by combining the Gabor transform (GT) and Wigner-Villedistribution (WVD). GT and WVD have been used separately on synthetic and recordedearthquake data to identify frequency shifting due to earthquake damages; but GT is proneto windowing effect and WVD involves ambiguity function. Hence to obtain better clarity andto remove the cross terms (frequency interference); GT and WVD are judiciously combinedand the resultant GWT used to identify frequency shifting.

For this; the dispersion equationis derived analytically and solved numerically for typical values of physical quantities. Ourcalculations reveal that two types of instabilities occur in the said plasma if the dust particlesand relativistic effects of ions and electrons are considered. Both types of the instabilities arehigh-frequency instabilities; which carry growth rates of different magnitudes. In view of themagnitudes; the instability having higher/lower growth rate is called as high-frequencyhigher/lower growth rate instability. The relativistic effects of ions support the growth of theseinstabilities; whereas those of electrons suppress the growth of the instabilities.

Design of high-speed power efficient full adder with body-biasing,Amit Kumar; Pankaj Srivastava; Manisha Pattanaik,A new 1-bit full adder cell has been introduced in this paper. According to this approachbody-biasing and semi domino logic both are used in a single full adder. Body-biasingtechnique is used to vary the threshold voltage to operate this adder at higher speed byallowing the faster gate switching. The important thing in this approach is that there is norequirement of any external circuitry for body-biasing. Also; the power consumption of theproposed full adder circuit is very low by using the lower power supply and semi dominologic. Proposed design circuit is 1.5 to 2 times faster than the dynamic gate-level bodybiased design. The circuit design and analysis are carried out at 45 nm technology inSILVACO-ICCAD environment.

Two layer security for data storage in cloud,A Ashok Kumar; A Jagan,Cloud data security is one of the critical factors of business conviction. Increasing internetbugs and intrusion necessitate efficient security mechanism. The work presented hereproposed a two layer mechanism for providing efficient and computationally light securityprocedure. At the first layer public key cryptography has been used; whereas second layer istotally based on steganography. RSA method is used for key exchange and AES forencryption and decryption to make the method computationally efficient. Since the secondlayer shuffles the encrypted messages in stegad images so security is much higher thanindividual approach and other existing approaches. The cloud is computationally veryefficient and these processes computationally very light so availability of data is unaffectedthrough it.,Futuristic Trends on Computational Analysis and Knowledge Management (ABLAZE); 2015 International Conference on,2015,1

Anaesthetic Mortality: A Clinical And Medico-Legal Scenario,Rakesh Kumar; Awdhesh Kumar,Abstract: The death that occurs inside the operation theater often evoked considerabledistress to the relatives of the patient and the subsequent misgivings on the team of doctorsthat performed the surgery. Anesthetic death is defined as death occurring within 24 hours ofadministration of anesthesia due to causes related to anesthesia. However; death may occureven afterwards due to its complications. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)has devised a classification system to grade the preoperative condition of the patient. Thestate of general anesthesia of necessity deprives the patient of the majority of his protectivereflexes. In India; if the patient dies when a surgical procedure performed under anesthesia;often the anesthetist is unfairly accused of causing the death. The examination should bedone into consideration by the pathologist when investigating an anesthetic death. There …,Int J Science and Research,2015,1
Gene Duplications and Fates of Genes after Duplication Events,A Kumar,There are several puzzles about how duplicate genes are retained during evolution. Severalmodels have been proposed over in last four decades. Classical duplication-degeneration-complementation/subfunctionalization models do not invoke positive selection; however; thiscan impose higher rates for retaining duplicate genes in small populations only. Rodentshave higher retentions rates duplicate genes and only few losses in comparison to humanswhich corroborates that positive selections are more instrumental players than previouslyassumed [18]. Suppose a condition where two redundant gene copies were retained in thegenome without significant functional divergence; this can covenant increase geneticrobustness against harmful mutations in the concerned species (Figure 1C). Withinmultigene families descended from a common ancestor; these genes possess similarities …,Austin Journal of Genetics and Genomic Research,2015,1

Attenuation of P and S waves for Chamba region,S Banerjee; A Kumar,ABSTRACT In order to minimize the structural damages during an earthquake; the properestimation of ground motions is desired. Considering the present codal recommendations;these ground motions can be considered in earthquake resistant design in the form ofaverage response acceleration coefficient. These level of ground shaking varies from site tosite and can be divided into bedrock level ground motions and its alteration due to thepresence of local soils. In order to determine bedrock level ground motion characteristics forthe future earthquake; it is required to perform the seismic hazard analysis of the site underconsideration. Depending upon the structural requirements; a seismic hazard analysis canbe performed deterministically or probabilistically. Either methods of seismic hazardassessment requires a region specific attenuation relation.

Role of equilibrium plasma flow on damping of slow MHD waves,N Kumar; P Kumar; A Kumar; R Chauhan,Abstract In the solar corona waves and oscillatory activities are observed with modernimaging and spectral instruments. These oscillations are interpreted as slow magneto-acoustic waves excited impulsively in coronal loops. This study explores the effect of steadyplasma flow on the dissipation of slow magneto-acoustic waves in the solar coronal loopspermeated by uniform magnetic field. We have investigated the damping of slow waves inthe coronal plasma taking into account viscosity and thermal conductivity as dissipativeprocesses. On solving the dispersion relation it is found that the presence of plasma flowinfluences the characteristics of wave propagation and dissipation. We have shown that thetime damping of slow waves exhibits varying behavior depending upon the physicalparameters of the loop.

Nonvolatile resistance memory switching in polycrystalline ZnO thin films grown by RF magnetron sputtering,Amit Kumar; Manoj Kumar; Beer Pal Singh,Abstract In this paper; the resistance switching characteristics of polycrystalline ZnO thin filmwere investigated for non-volatile memory. ZnO thin films grown by RF magnetron sputteringon Ti/SiO2/Si substrate were highly resistive and caxis oriented. The ZnO thin film showedreliable and repeated switching behavior under small voltage. Resistance ratios of the highresistance state to low resistance state were obtained to be several orders of magnitude upto 20 cycles. It is believed that this resistance change is due to the difference in point defectdensity. Both the low and high resistance states showed linear log current versus log voltagecharacteristics in the low voltage. The observed results were examined on the basis offilamentary conductions with the contribution of local Joule heating effect.

An Extensible Action Architecture for Planning in Complex Domains,Amit Kumar; Alexander Nareyek,Abstract Planning in complex domains; including temporal and resource planning; oftenrequires an expressive and flexible model of actions. For example; in a rover domain; theenergy of the rover; a bottleneck resource; is consumed at a high rate while performing adrive action and in proportion to the distance traversed. Based on the current energy levels;the planning system can adapt the distance traversed due to the drive actions in order tobest achieve its goals; ie; if more energy is left; drive actions can be prolonged. To handlesuch domains; we consider an expressive model of actions containing variables (to denote;eg; the energy consumed and the distance traversed within a drive action); and relationsbetween the variables (eg; the energy consumed is proportional to the distance traversed).We call these relations Action Component Relations (ACRs).

Efficient broadcast in MANET using trust mechanisms,Amit Kumar; Sunita Prasad,Broadcasting is the fundamental operation of mobile ad hoc network; in which a sourcenode transmits the packets that is disseminated to all the nodes in the network. Broadcastingis used in mobile ad hoc network either to broadcast control packets during route discoveryor to broadcast the data packets. The simplest method used for broadcast is flooding thatdegenerates the performance of MANET due to packets collision; contention; andredundancy. This results in the wastage of limited network bandwidth. This paper proposesan efficient approach to broadcast with reduced redundancy and improved performance.The proposed approach is based on the determination of trust between the communicatingnodes called as intimacy factor (IF). The IF is calculated for the entire route by the nodes;which is updated. The IF determines whether the packet is to be broadcast or not. The …,Methods and Models in Computer Science; 2009.

Long-latency branches: how much do they matter?,Abhas Kumar; Nisheet Jain; Mainak Chaudhuri,Abstract Dynamic branch prediction plays a key role in delivering high performance in themodern microprocessors. The cycles between the prediction of a branch and its executionconstitute the branch misprediction penalty because a misprediction can be detected onlyafter the branch executes. Branch misprediction penalty depends not only on the depth ofthe pipeline; but also on the availability of branch operands. Fetched branches belonging tothe dependence chains of loads that miss in the L1 data cache exhibit very highmisprediction penalty due to the delay in the execution resulting from unavailability ofoperands. We call these the long-latency branches. It has been speculated that predictingsuch branches accurately or identifying such mispredicted branches before they executewould be beneficial. In this paper; we show that in a traditional pipeline the frequency of …,ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News,2006,1

Clinico-haematological studies in cow and buffalo calves with natural infection of Toxocara vitulorum (Goeze; 1782).,HU Devi; MZ Ansari; SK Singh; A Kumar,Abstract: A total of 40 calves (24 buffaloes and 16 cows) were randomly selected [. 30 (18buffaloes and 12 cows)] were naturally infected with Toxocara vitulorun. The commonclinical signs in infected calves were closely related to the intensity of infection and faecalegg counts. Haemoglobin; packed cell volume and total erythrocyte count values of theaffected calves were significantly (P< 0.01) low. Increased mean corpuscular volume anddecreased mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration indicated macrocytic tonormocytic; hypochromic anaemia. Ten of the infected calves were treated with an ayurvedicmedicine (Kriminth; 50 ml given orally twice at a 15 day interval) and 10 were treated withpiperazine citrate (200 mg/kg given twice at a 15 day interval). Piperazine citrate restoredthe haematological indices to almost normal levels.,Journal of Veterinary Parasitology,2000,1

Neuroendocrine response to challenge in HIV-1 infection: Its possible role in stress adaptation and management interventions,M Kumar; MH Antoni; AM Kumar; D Cruess; A Danielson; JB Fernandez; C Eisdorfer; N Schneiderman,It is well documented that HPA axis activity is influenced by endogenous challenges such asviral infections. In the case of HIV-1 infection; recent studies show additional pathways thatcan further derange the HPA axis. It has been reported that the HIV-related protein; vpr;interacts with glucocorticoid receptors and that POMC-cortcotropin releasing hormone(CRH)-REB has homology with the HIV-LTR sequence. It can; therefore; be hypothesizedthat neuroendocrine responses to challenge will be compromised in HIV infection and willlead to abnormalities in stress adaptation.

Indian Tea Exports: An Analysis of its Performance and Constraints,Alok Kumar; Ramani Kumar,Economic Affairs; Vol. 41; Or. 3; September 1996 INDIAN TEA EXPORTS: AN ANALYSIS OFITS PERFORMANCE AND CONSTRAINTS Alok Kumar and Ramani Kumar* Tea has beenone of the major exportable commodities of India. It is one of the few commodities in whichIndia enjoys the status of a world leader. But the performance of tea exports has not beenimpressive; particularly in the 80's. The result is that India is fast losing its share in world teamarket. 1991 had been the watershed year for Indian tea exports.. Disintegration of USSR in1991; which had accounted for nearly 50% of Indian tea exports; meant a loss of the mostimportant market for Indian tea exporters. Also with the end of Rupee Payment Agreementwith USSR and other East European countries; Indian exporters lost an assured tea market.The present study analyses the performance of Indian tea exports 1971-92.

MULTIPLE INPUT; SINGLE OUTPUT RAINFALL RUNOFF MODEL,Akhilesh Kumar,The problem of predicting the runoff form a storm in a catchment has received considerableattention of the hydrologists in the past. A large number of methods are proposed but theresponse function based method such as the unit hydrogrph method is most popular andwidely used. One of the assumption followed in these methods is that the rainfall is occurringsimultaneously on the whole catchment with same intensity; which is practically not possible.Non uniformity in rainfall values over the catchment increases with its size. For largecatchment it may even happen that some part of the catchment would not have any rain at allduring the storm period. Therefore to derive a response function for a large catchment; wecan divide it into a number of sub-catchments having the uniform rainfall in that sub-catchment. In the present thesis first a multiple input; single output non-linear rainfall …,*,1996,1

Reliability analysis of a system with a human operator and subject to two failure modes,Ashok Kumar; SC Garg,Abstract A repairable system which is operated by a human operator is considered. Thehuman operator can be in three possible states: normal; moderate stress and extremestress. The system can fail because of self-corrected and nonself-corrected human errors.The system fails at an exponential rate for different human operator states. The rate ofchange of the human operator state is also exponential between states. Repair timedistributions of the system failed from different states are different and general. Thestochastic behavior of the system has been studied in detail with the help of SMP; andvarious parameters (MTSF; steady-state availability; expected profit rate; etc.) are obtained.Numerical illustrations are included to explain the results.,Microelectronics Reliability,1991,1

Application of Trombay Criticality Formula in the assessment of nuclear criticality safety problems,M Srinivasan; A Kumar; Rao Subba,The Trombay Criticality Formula (TCF) has been derived by incorporating a number of wellknown concepts of Criticality Physics to compute changes in critical size or Keff followingalterations in geometrical or physical parameters of uniformly reflected small reactorassemblies characterised by large neutron leakage from the core. The variant parameters ofinterest to TCF are size; shape; density and diluent concentration of the core and densityand thickness of the reflector. A central feature of TCF is that the core size is here measuredin terms of its mean chord length (l-bar) given by four times its volume-to-surface area ratio(4 V/S) or more generally; taking core density also into account by its''surface massdensity''(σ). This has the advantage that it can be applied to cores of any arbitrary shape.The effect of changes in the variant parameters other than size manifest through (σ c); the …,*,1987,1

Role of Village Health Worker in Health Problems of Developing Countries,YC Mathur; AJIT KUMAR,Abstract Most health care delivery systems have failed to make care accessible andacceptable to the people who need it. Primary health care must be available close topeople's homes. As the acceptance of many health measures may involve a change of livinghabits; the community itself must decide on the measures; help in carrying them out; andevaluate their success. Basic health care can be given by ordinary people provided theyhave adequate education; training and technical advice and supervision. Local resourcescan be tapped in organising the delivery of health care so that part of it belongs to those it isdesigned to serve; and it has numerous advantages. For delivery of primary health careamongst rural population; simple preventive means could be undertaken by a local villagehealth worker; for example giving oral vitamin 'A'; deworming; immunization with a jet …,Journal of Tropical Pediatrics,1978,1

NUCLEAR THEORY BASED CROSS SECTIONS OF TH-232; TH-233 AND U-233 AND THEIR APPLICATIONS IN REACTOR TECHNOLOGY.,SB Garg; Ashok Kumar,Thorium fuel cycle is an active subject of research particularly for us since we have largedeposits of thorium. Because of various reasons thorium has not found much favour with thereactor technologists and therefore its cross sections have not been studied with the desiredaccuracy. But; with the upcoming of fast reactor technology in this country thorium is boundto find a place as a fertile material to produce uranium-233. It is; therefore; imperative for usto estimate the cross sections of thorium-232; thorium-233 and uranium-233 in the MeVenergy range based on nuclear theory.,Radiation physics: proceedings of the International Symposium on Radiation Physics; held at Bose Institute; Calcutta; India; November 30-December 4; 1974,1977,1
Use of the S/360 CSMP package in solving an external boundary-layer flow problem,Ashok Kumar; SC Cheng; LG Birta,External boundary-layer flow problems with constant heat flux and variable physicalproperties are; in general; difficult to deal with computationally. In this study; a particularproblem of this type is investigated using the S/360 CSMP package. A varia tionalformulation based on the concept of local potential is first applied to transform the twofundamental coupled nonlinear partial differential equations into two more-tractable ordinarydifferen tial equations. The study has yielded information concerning flow performance aswell as information on the sensitivity of thermal conductivity and viscosity to the local Nusseltnumber and local friction factor. Wherever possible a comparison has been made betweenthe results from this study and those obtained from the literature. Close agreement has beenobtained in all cases.

Photoluminescence Quenching Based Visual and Spectroscopic Method for Mercury Sensing by Surface-Modified Cadmium Sulphide Quantum Dots,Ambika Kumar; RK Dutta,Here we present a simple yet efficient analytical method for sensing ultratrace levels of Hg2+ions by highly water soluble CdS quantum dots functionalized with thiourea as a probe. Thebluish photoluminescence emission of the probe responded to a systematic linearphotoluminescence quenching in the presence of increasing concentration of Hg2+ ions.The photoluminescence quenching by Hg2+ ions was attributed to agglomeration of thequantum dots; which has been confirmed by zeta potential measurements. The sensitivity(31.38 L/mg) and LoD (0.11 μg/L) of Hg2+ ion detection by our method are two foldsimproved with respect to the existing data of CdS as sensor. The improved detection isattributable to synthesis of less than 3 nm diameter CdS quantum dots which rendered veryhigh water solubility and hence facilitated better interaction with Hg2+ ions.

Heme interaction of the intrinsically disordered N-terminal peptide segment of human cystathionine-β-synthase,Amit Kumar; Amelie Wißbrock; Nishit Goradia; Peter Bellstedt; Ramadurai Ramachandran; Diana Imhof; Oliver Ohlenschläger,Abstract Cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) belongs to a large family of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate(PLP)-dependent enzymes; responsible for the sulfur metabolism. The heme-dependentprotein CBS is part of regulatory pathways also involving the gasotransmitter hydrogensulfide. Malfunction of CBS can lead to pathologic conditions like cancer; cardiovascular andneurodegenerative disorders. Truncation of residues 1–40; absent in X-ray structures ofCBS; reduces but does not abolish the activity of the enzyme.

Substrate‐induced structural alterations of Mycobacterial mycothione reductase and critical residues involved,Arvind Kumar; Subramanian Manimekalai; Malathy Sony; Gerhard Grüber,Abstract Redox homeostasis is a prerequisite for survival of the pathogen Mycobacteriumtuberculosis (Mtb) which employs the low molecular weight thiol mycothiol (MSH). TheMycobacterial NADPH-dependent mycothione reductase (MtMtr); composed of an NADPH-;FAD-; and a dimerization-domain connected by linkers; regulates the balance of oxidized–reduced MSH. Here; we demonstrate by small-angle X-ray scattering; that NADPH-bindingalters the oligomeric state equilibrium of the protein with no significant overall structuralchange after MSH-binding. Mutation of critical residues in the linker regions of MtMtreliminate partially or totally the NADPH-induced oligomerization effect with simultaneouseffect on enzyme activity. The data provide insight into the MtMtr linker regions involved inthe novel oligomerization equilibrium of the Mycobacterial enzyme.,FEBS letters,2018,*

Rice starch is hydrolyzed byenzymes in the digestive tract and converted into glucose which is the main energy sourcefor metabolic functions. After meeting the energy requirement of the body; the extra caloriesfrom starch are stored as glycogen or fats for later use. Therefore; overeating rice withsedentary lifestyle potentially leads to some health problems; such as obesity; type-IIdiabetes; and colon diseases in long terms especially in Asian countries. Starch hydrolysisbegins in the mouth with the action of salivary α-amylase and continues in the small intestinewith involvement of other enzymes.

Myosin Heavy Chain-embryonic is a crucial regulator of skeletal muscle development and differentiation.,Akashi Sharma; Megha Agarwal; Amit Kumar; Pankaj Kumar; Masum Saini; Gabrielle Kardon; Sam Mathew,Myosin heavy chains (MyHCs) are contractile proteins that are part of the thick filaments ofthe functional unit of the skeletal muscle; the sarcomere. In addition to MyHCs that are part ofthe adult muscle contractile network; two MyHCs—MyHC-embryonic and-perinatal—areexpressed during muscle development and are only transiently expressed in the adultduring regeneration. The functions performed by these MyHCs has been a long-standingquestion and using a targeted mouse allele; we have characterized the role of MyHC-embryonic. Analysis of loss-of-function mice reveals that lack of MyHC-embryonic leads tomis-regulation of other MyHCs; alterations in fiber size; fiber number and fiber type atneonatal stages. We also find that loss of MyHC-embryonic leads to mis-regulation of genesinvolved in muscle differentiation. A broad theme from these studies is that loss of MyHC …,bioRxiv,2018,*

Demonstration of a Novel Two Source Region Tunnel FET,Navjeet Bagga; Anil Kumar; Sudeb Dasgupta,A novel silicon-on-insulator (SOI)-based tunnel FET (TFET) with two source regions (TSRs)is proposed and investigated by Sentaurus simulation. The incorporation of the TSR in theSOI platform augmented the effective tunneling area between source–channel junctions andhence boosts the drive current of the device. To restrain the leakage current at a lower value;we have introduced an isolator oxide which avoids the direct coupling of the source and thedrain. The typical figure of merit of any device is its ${I} _ {\mathrm {\scriptscriptstyle ON}}/{I} _{\mathrm {\scriptscriptstyle OFF}} $ ratio; which is $\sim {9}\times {10}^{{10}} $ of ourproposed structure. The impact of various device geometry variations has been studied andoptimized accordingly through extensive simulation. We have also benchmarked ourproposed TSR-TFET results with the modified L-shaped TFET; line tunneling-based TFET …,IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices,2017,*

Real-time face relighting via adaptive normal mapping,Pradeep Choudhary; Sumedh Mannar; Amit Kumar; Minjung Son,Abstract In this paper; we present a real-time face relighting method for enhancing widelyused face photographs such asselfies'. In contrast with previous relighting methods thatestimate and replace the real lighting condition with the intended one; our technique focuseson the aesthetic aspects of relighting with real-time interaction. We estimate the head posebased on the facial features and apply adaptive face normal mapping by transforming andinterpolating pre-defined face normal maps. The lighting effect is calculated using adaptivelymapped normals and overlaid on the original photograph. The experimental results showthat the proposed method generates aesthetic face photographs without a computationaloverhead; enabling real-time face relighting for mobile applications.,SIGGRAPH Asia 2017 Mobile Graphics & Interactive Applications,2017,*

Investigation of magnetoelectric properties and biocompatibility of CoFe2O4-BaTiO3 core-shell nanoparticles for biomedical applications,Badari Narayana Rao; P Kaviraj; SR Vaibavi; Amit Kumar; Saumendra Kumar Bajpai; A Arockiarajan,The CoFe2O4-BaTiO3 core-shell (CFO@ BTO) nanocomposites have been synthesized;and a particular volume fraction of 15% CoFe2O4–85% BaTiO3 has been studied for itsmagnetic; ferroelectric; and magnetoelectric properties. The optimization of synthesisconditions showed that a temperature of at least 800° C is required to obtain pure phaseBaTiO3; whereas for the tetragonality to be visible in the x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern;BaTiO3 needed to be sintered to at least 1050° C. Even though the CFO@ BTO compositebegan to react at the interface at 1050° C and a small amount of the secondary phase wasobserved in the XRD pattern; the ferroelectric and magnetic properties were found to be notaffected. Upon treating the living epithelial cells with either CFO@ BTO or BTOnanoparticles; no toxicity was observed for up to 7 days. Together; these results establish …,Journal of Applied Physics,2017,*

A real-time ferroalloy model for the optimum ladle furnace treatment during the secondary steelmaking,Anil Kumar Kothari; Rajeev Ranjan; Rama Shankar Singh; Gaurav Kumar; Ashutosh Kumar; Ashish Agrawal,ABSTRACT Various means are applied in the steel making process to attain the desiredchemistry. The final chemistry adjustments are made predominantly during the secondarymetallurgy route in which ferroalloys (FAs) are added. With the availability of various FAs; itbecomes necessary to identify the comparatively cheaper and optimum amount of FAs. Thetraditional practice of manually determining the quantity of FAs could not optimise thecomplete process. It is; therefore; necessary to determine the optimum FA addition withoutany human intervention. This paper presents a ferroalloy model in which a two-stepincremental approach is adopted in ladle furnace (LF) to resemble the current operationalpractice. The model is designed such that no external intervention is needed to determinethe required FA amount to be added. This results in low cost and high quality.

Talin plays an important role in cell-cell interactions,Devang M Patel; Akhilesh Kumar; William Morgan; Michael D Birnbaum; Chaunhua Jiang; Fangliang Zhang,Appropriate cell adhesion is necessary for numerous physiological processes and can bederanged in many diseases; including cancer. It has long been recognized that thecadherins mediated cell-cell adhesion receptor is an important determinant of tumorprogression; serving as a suppressor of invasion and metastasis. Recently a role for the C-terminal region of talin (the VAD fragment) in cadherin mediated cell-cell attachment hasbeen suggested; but its molecular mechanism remained unclear. Here; we identified a smallregion of the VAD fragment required for its localization to cadherin-mediated cell-celljunctions and also found that its localization to cell-cell junctions is independent of its actinbinding properties.

In addition; it was recently shown that Ate1-deficient fibroblasts demonstratecancer-like characteristics including genomic instability and mutagenesis. While Ate1's rolein cancer is poorly understood; our preliminary studies suggest that Ate1 is an importantregulator of metastasis and cancer progression in prostate cancer models. In this study; ourdata suggests that Ate1 is essential for normal cell stress response in conditions includingcellular oxidant; apoptosis inducing drugs; and radiation. Further; we show that a loss ofAte1 in LnCaP prostate cancer cells increases anchorage-independent growth in the soft-agar assay; and that a loss of Ate1 in PC-3 prostate cancer cells increases matrigel …,*,2017,*
Fast steering and quick positioning of large field-of-regard; two-axis; four-gimbaled sight,Zahir Ahmed Ansari; Madhav Ji Nigam; Avnish Kumar,Fast steering and quick positioning are prime requirements of the current electro-opticaltracking system to achieve quick target acquisition. A scheme has been proposed forrealizing these features using two-axis; four-gimbaled sight. For steering the line of sight inthe stabilization mode; outer gimbal is slaved to the gyro stabilized inner gimbal. Typically;the inner gimbals have direct drives and outer gimbals have geared drives; which result in amismatch in the acceleration capability of their servo loops. This limits the allowable controlbandwidth for the inner gimbal. However; to achieve high stabilization accuracy; highbandwidth control loops are essential. This contradictory requirement has been addressedby designing a suitable command conditioning module for the inner gimbals. Also; large line-of-sight freedom in pitch axis is required to provide a wide area surveillance capacity for …,Optical Engineering,2017,*

Glycosylation of the core of the HIV-1 envelope subunit protein gp120 is not required for native trimer formation or viral infectivity,Ujjwal Rathore; Piyali Saha; Sannula Kesavardhana; Aditya Arun Kumar; Rohini Datta; Sivasankar Devanarayanan; Raksha Das; John R Mascola; Raghavan Varadarajan,Abstract The gp120 subunit of the HIV-1 envelope (Env) protein is heavily glycosylated at∼25 glycosylation sites; of which∼ 7–8 are located in the V1/V2 and V3 variable loops andthe others in the remaining core gp120 region. Glycans partially shield Env from recognitionby the host immune system and also are believed to be indispensable for proper folding ofgp120 and for viral infectivity. Previous attempts to alter glycosylation sites in Env typicallyinvolved mutating the glycosylated asparagine residues to structurally similar glutamines oralanines. Here; we confirmed that such mutations at multiple glycosylation sites greatlydiminish viral infectivity and result in significantly reduced binding to both neutralizing andnon-neutralizing antibodies.

Study of Weld Integrity and Nugget Development in Seam-Welded Cold-Rolled High-Strength Steels,Amrendra Kumar; Soumendu Monia; Hrishikesh Jugade; Ajay Kumar Jha; Manashi Adhikary,Abstract Production processes like continuous annealing and continuous galvanizing/galvannealing rely on welding of two strips across their width; for continuous operation. Theoperational stability of these lines depends highly on the consistency of the welding process.Any failure of weld joint during processing is detrimental to production as the recovery timesare very high (~ 1–3 days). Two instances of similar weld failures having identical chemicalcomposition and dimensions of the strips were investigated to identify the root cause andestablish adequate countermeasures. A systematic approach to evaluate weld performanceusing metallographic examination was carried out. The examinations revealed that poornugget formation was the root cause of failure.

Transition from Gas Lift to Electric Submersible Pump in Wells with High Gas Volume Fraction-Avenues for Profitability in Challenging Markets-A Novel Case Study o...,Prasant Goel; A Kumar; H Duara; TK Mandal; KR Rao; VV Manchalwar,Abstract 27 gas lift wells of an Indian Offshore field were studied for feasibility of conversionof Gas lift mode to ESP. The wells have good productivity indices ranging from 1barrel/day/psi to 6.9 barrel/day/psi. However; the production challenge was to operate thesewells in a region where bubble point pressure was higher than the formation pressure itselfand thus posed problem of gas evolution at the wellbore. During ESP operation in High GasVolume Fraction (GVF) regions; extreme difference in the densities of the liquid and gas leadto a low pressure area in the Impeller during the pumping operation across the stages ofESP; resulting in gas accumulation. Free gas in these stages displaces liquid and lowersdown the volumetric efficiency of the pump. In the past; 13 offshore wells were installed withESP and many of these ESPs failed.

Seasonal Differences in Birth Weights and Lengths Depends on Exposure During Pregnancy in Rural India,Emily M Madan; Jere D Haas; Purnima Menon; Vishwajeet Kumar; Aarti Kumar; Shambhavi Singh; Swati Dixit,Background Birth weight and birth length are important indicators of morbidity; mortality andfuture growth and development during childhood and adulthood. The seasonality of theseindicators has been documented in various developing countries; but there is a dearth ofdata from rural South Asia. Seasonal variations in anthropometry are generally attributed toseasonal deteriorations in maternal health and nutritional status that occur during pregnancywhen food supplies are diminished; and both agricultural labor demands and risk forinfectious disease are high. Peak fetal growth velocity in length and weight occur during the2 nd and 3 rd trimester of pregnancy; respectively; and are thus periods when fetal growthmay be particularly vulnerable to seasonal insults.

Posttranslational arginylation enzyme Ate1 affects DNA mutagenesis by regulating stress response,Akhilesh Kumar; Michael D Birnbaum; Devang M Patel; William M Morgan; Jayanti Singh; Antoni Barrientos; Fangliang Zhang,Abstract Arginylation is a protein posttranslational modification (PTM) which leads toaddition of an extra arginine at the N-terminus of the target proteins and peptides. Thisprocess is evolutionarily conserved; and is mediated by arginyltransferase1 (Ate1). Whileearlier studies found that the overall arginylation activity often increases during stressingconditions including heat shock; oxidative stress; and injury; little is known about the role ofarginylation or Ate1 in stress response. Here we report that arginylation promotes growtharrest and cell death; depending on the nature and intensity of the stressing factor.Specifically; in yeast; mouse and human cells; deletion or downregulation of the ATE1 genedisrupts typical stress responses by bypassing growth arrest and suppressing cell deathevents under stressing conditions such as oxidative stress; heat shock; and osmotic …,The FASEB Journal,2017,*

The fast moving consumer goods (FMCGs); on the otherhand; are the fourth largest industry in the world. FMCGs are relatively low cost products andthe poor; by necessity; spend a significant amount of their income on FMCGs. So; by virtue ofbeing a large consumer base for FMCGs; the poor are a promising market for the FMCGmarketers. But little is known about their buying behaviour for FMCGs as only a few studieshave been conducted on them in this regard.

Restoring calcium homeostasis in diabetic cardiomyocytes: an investigation through mathematical modelling,Phonindra Nath Das; Ajay Kumar; Nandadulal Bairagi; Samrat Chatterjee,Calcium homeostasis is a key factor in the regulation of cardiac excitation–contractioncoupling. Calcium dynamics in cardiomyocytes is governed by ATP which depends oninsulin dependent glucose concentration; via the glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4)transporter. It would therefore be interesting to see how calcium dynamics changes in acardiomyocyte under diabetic conditions. We proposed and analysed a four dimensionalordinary differential equation (ODE) model to capture the interdependency of calciumdynamics on glucose uptake and ATP generation. More specifically; we looked for the role ofGLUT4; energy metabolism; L-type channels; RyR2 channels; SERCA2a pumps andleakage rate in the normal functioning of cardiomyocytes.

Climate Change’s Impacts on Weeds and Herbicide Efficacy: A Review,Amit Kumar; Mukesh Kumar,Climate change is continuous process; in past it occurred over hundred or thousand s ofyears. But recent changes in climate make alarming attention because of its shift occurs onlyin a few decades. Climate change occurs due to natural and human activities.Anthropogenic activities contribute largely to global warming by affecting the amounts ofgreenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols (small particles). These emissions accumulate inEarth's atmosphere and increase in concentration over time; creating the so-calledgreenhouse effect; which can alter energy balance by transmitting incoming solar radiationbut absorbing outgoing thermal radiation from the surface (Schneider; 1992).

Hemorrhagic metastasis to brain from a primary mucoepidermoid carcinoma of esophagus,Yatish Agarwal; Sagar Tomar; Amit Kumar; Avneet S Chawla; Vinod Gupta; Poonam Khambra,Abstract Primary esophageal cancers rarely metastasize to the brain. On the rare occasionthat such an event occurs; the histological cell type is mostly a squamous cell carcinoma.These brain metastases are picked up on contrast computed tomography typically asmultiple ring enhancing hypodense lesions. In the histological spectrum of esophagealcancers; a mucoepidermoid carcinoma is rather rare. The possibility of it metastasizing to thebrain is rarer still. That such a metastatic lesion be hemorrhagic is truly atypical; yet this casein point uncovers such an event; where an upper esophageal mucoepidermoid carcinoma ina 55-year-old male led to a hemorrhagic metastasis in the vermis of the cerebellum.,Astrocyte,2016,*
A survey on offline handwritten signature verification system using writer dependent and independent approaches,Ashok Kumar; Karamjit Bhatia,Handwritten signature verification systems are studied using On-line and Off-lineapproaches. Due to the lack of dynamic information; Off-line signature verification systemsare more difficult to compare to On-line verification systems. There are two differentapproaches to deal with the problem of off-line signature verification. The first one is thewriter dependent model (also known as personal model) and other is writer independentmodel (also known as global model). This paper presents a survey of off-line handwrittensignature verification systems using writer dependent (WD) and writer independent (WI)approaches. Many recently used approaches of verification systems have been investigated.A conclusion of all these works and an outlook into the future work is also presented in thispaper.,Advances in Computing; Communication; & Automation (ICACCA)(Fall); International Conference on,2016,*

Polymer-based surface acoustic wave device operating in ultra-high frequency,Arvind Kumar; Soumya Dutta,The high cost of conventional surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices limits its widespreaduse as micro-sensor and actuator for lab-on-a-chip applications. Solution-processed;inexpensive SAW device based on poly [(vinylidenefluoride-co-trifluoroethylene][P (VDF-TrFE)]; a ferroelectric polymer; is an alternative route to address this issue. However;incompatibility of P (VDF-TrFE) films with photoresist strippers and temperature intensivesteps; often used in the optical lithography process; impede the development of efficientSAW device.

Posttranslational arginylation enzyme Ate1 affects DNA mutagenesis by regulating stress response,Akhilesh Kumar; Michael D Birnbaum; Devang M Patel; William M Morgan; Jayanti Singh; Antoni Barrientos; Fangliang Zhang,Abstract Arginyltransferase 1 (Ate1) mediates protein arginylation; a poorly understoodprotein posttranslational modification (PTM) in eukaryotic cells. Previous evidence suggest apotential involvement of arginylation in stress response and this PTM was traditionallyconsidered anti-apoptotic based on the studies of individual substrates. However; here wefound that arginylation promotes cell death and/or growth arrest; depending on the natureand intensity of the stressing factor. Specifically; in yeast; mouse and human cells; deletionor downregulation of the ATE1 gene disrupts typical stress responses by bypassing growtharrest and suppressing cell death events in the presence of disease-related stressingfactors; including oxidative; heat; and osmotic stresses; as well as the exposure to heavymetals or radiation.

However; the role of Ate1 in cancer initiation and progression is not clear. Thisstudy examines the effects of Ate1 loss in prostate cancer models of tumorigenesis andprogression. We first show that Ate1 is required for normal cellular responses to severaltypes of stress present in cancer. Preliminary data in fibroblasts shows that Ate1 is essentialfor cell death following oxidative stress; hypoxia; UV and gamma radiation; and apoptosis-inducing drugs. These results inspired further tests to examine if cancer progression may bedirectly stimulated by a loss of Ate1 through increased cell survival and invasiveness. To …,*,2016,*

Hereditary multiple exostosis; Diaphyseal aclasis (Aclasia); Multiple osteochondromas; Familial osteochondromatosis.,A Amaresh Kumar; R Ramesh Kumar; P Elamparidhi,ABSTRACT Multiple exostosis (diaphyseal aclasis) is a heritable disorder affecting theendochondral skeleton during the period of growth. It is characterized by thickening anddeformity of the growing bone with the formation of numerous cartilage-capped exostosesclustered around the areas of most active growth. Thus; the juxtaepiphyseal regions of thetubular bones; the ribs; pelvis; and scapulae are the most heavily affected areas; while thevertebral bodies; the patellae; and the carpal and tarsal bones are usually unaffected.Hereditary multiple exostosis demonstrates an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.(1),DIAPHYSEAL ACLASIS: A CASE REPORT WITH REVIEW OF LITERATURE,2016,*
Observation of Multiple Activation in Tg of Se90In8Ag2 Glassy Alloy,Dipti Sharma; RK Shukla; A Kumar; JC MacDonald,In the present study; multiple activation energy is reported for glass transition (Tg) ofSe90In8Ag2 glassy alloy during cooling. The Tg shows a linear relationship with coolingrates whereas the linearity of the transition follows three different linear trends for threedifferent cooling ranges mentioned as (a) low range;(b) medium range; and (c) high rangewhere they are defined as low range for 5 oC/min to 20 oC/min; medium range for 20 oC/minto 30 oC/min and high range for 30 oC/min to 50 oC/min. The activation energy is found tobe positive for all three ranges and indicates that the Se90In8Ag2 is a sensitive material tocooling rates and may bring the significance of being reused after multiple use of heatingruns in memory devices.\textbf {Keywords:} Activation Energy; Kinetics; calorimetry; cooling;heat flow; glass transition.,Bulletin of the American Physical Society,2016,*

Physico-chemical and sensory evaluation of fenugreek enriched salted biscuits,SANJEET KUMAR; AVANISH KUMAR; ATUL ANAND MISHRA; RN Shukla; AK Gautam,Biscuit are convenient food products; becoming very popular among both rural and urbanpopulations of India. Some of the reasons for such wide popularity are low cost among otherprocessed foods. India is the second largest wheat producing nation after China in the worldand contributes approximately 12 per cent to the world wheat production. The principle basisof most baked products that can be regarded; as snack food is wheat flour. The flour qualityis defined as ability of flour to produce uniformly good product and it will be very misleadingto define the product. This may be also because of good quality of one product may not begood quality of another baked product. Fenugreek seeds are rich in carbohydrates; andespecially mucilaginous fibre.

Understanding ice nucleation characteristics of selective mineral dusts suspended in solution,Anand Kumar; Claudia Marcolli; Lukas Kaufmann; Ulrich Krieger; Thomas Peter,Abstract Introduction & Objectives Freezing of liquid droplets and subsequent ice crystalgrowth affects optical properties of clouds and precipitation. Field measurements show thatice formation in cumulus and stratiform clouds begins at temperatures much warmer thanthose associated with homogeneous ice nucleation in pure water; which is ascribed toheterogeneous ice nucleation occurring on the foreign surfaces of ice nuclei (IN). Variousinsoluble particles such as mineral dust; soot; metallic particles; volcanic ash; or primarybiological particles have been suggested as IN. Among these the suitability of mineral dustsis best established. The ice nucleation ability of mineral dust particles may be modified whensecondary organic or inorganic substances are accumulating on the dust duringatmospheric transport.

Ate1-mediated posttranslational arginylation is essential for stress response regulation and mutagenesis suppression,Akhilesh Kumar; Michael D Birnbaum; William Morgan; Fangliang Zhang,Abstract Arginylation is a posttranslational modification which leads to addition of an extraarginine to an existing peptide chain; thus changing the de facto primary sequence and thesurface change. This process is evolutionarily conserved and mainly mediated byarginyltransferase1 (Ate1). While earlier studies found that the overall arginylation activityoften increases during stressing conditions including heat shock; oxidative stress; and injury;little is known about the role of arginylation or Ate1 in these conditions. In our study by usingmultiple types of eukaryotic cells as test models; we found that Ate1/arginylation is essentialfor stress response; apoptosis and mutagenesis suppression. Knockout of Ate1 in cellsleads to a retardation of stress response and the diminish of apoptosis and cell death duringexposure of high doses of stressing factors including heat shock; oxidative and osmotic …,The FASEB Journal,2016,*

Beyond M-score for detection of misusability by malicious insiders,J Pradeep Kumar; A Udaya Kumar; T Ravi,As data is very important for any enterprise; prevention of misuse of data in the context ofdata mining assumes much importance of late. There are many threats to the privacy of datafrom insiders and outsiders. In fact; prevention of misuse of data is very challenging problemto be addressed. Towards this end Harel et al. proposed a measure named “M-score” whichuses sensitivity weights in order to estimate misusablity. It can tell the risk level when data isexposed for mining. However; the sensitivity related aspects of this measure anddistinguishing factors can be further improved. In this paper; we improve M-score to supportmultiple distinguishing factors and many combinations of sensitivity levels so as to make itmore useful and accurate for estimating misusability of data before outsourcing it to thirdparty for data mining.

Mitigation technique and measurement of subsynchronous resonance,Ankita Singh; Neeraj Verma; Atul Kumar,Due to development in the field of power system; more and more series capacitancecompensations have been used in transmission system extensively and because of seriescapacitance compensation it leads to SSR problems. SSR occurs when a natural frequencyof a series compensated transmission system coincides with the complement of one of thetorsional modes of the turbine-generator shaft system. Under such circumstances; theturbine-generator shaft system oscillates at a frequency corresponding to the torsional modefrequency and unless corrective action is taken; the torsional oscillations can grow and mayresult in shaft damage in a few seconds. For mitigating the SSR in transmission system; amitigation measure based on SVC is introduced [1].,Innovation and Challenges in Cyber Security (ICICCS-INBUSH); 2016 International Conference on,2016,*

Predicting pod fly (Melanagromyza obtusa Malloch.) incidence on long duration pigeonpea in Uttar Pradesh,SK Singh; Amrender Kumar; Ranjana Agrawal; Hemant Kumar; CP Srivastava; DC Singh; Arti Katiyar; Saurabh Singh; Jeewesh Kumar,Pod fly Melanagromyza obtusa Malloch (Diptera: Agromyzidae) is a noxious insect pest;infesting long duration pigeonpea in eastern regions of India. Considering the economicimportance of the pest in the crop; qualitative and qualitative models for predicting incidencewere developed for three districts viz.; Kanpur; Varanasi and Faizabad of Uttar Pradesh.Models were validated based on the pod fly damage during two preceding years (2012–13and 2013–14) for all the three locations. Coefficient of determination (R2) during 1st SMWwas 0.52 and increased to 0.78 during 4th SMW in Kanpur; Varanasi and Faizabad. Thus;model at 4th SMW was used for forecasting pod damage. By this model; prediction of pod flyincidence can be made based on temperature and relative humidity prevailing during 45thSMW of the preceding year in pigeonpea.,Journal of Food Legumes,2016,*

CPW fed Dielectric Resonator Antenna with complementary characteristics,Aneesh Kumar; Latheef A Shaik; Chinmoy Saha; Jawad Y Siddiqui,This paper proposes a new coplanar waveguide (CPW) fed Dielectric Resonator Antenna(DRA) with complementary characteristics. It is shown that an ultrawideband DRA can beoperated as a narrow band antenna as well as a frequency notched wideband antenna byusing a combinatorial loading of split ring resonators (SRR) and shunt strip between signalline and ground planes of the feeding CPW line. Using the SRRs alone yield a frequencynotch in the wideband response whereas the combination of SRRs and shorting stripsprovides a narrowband response.

Optimizing compression for power efficient wireless multimedia sensor networks,Avnish Kumar; Brahmjit Singh,Main focus of our study here is how to reach optimum compression in the wirelessMultimedia Sensor Network (WMSN) so as to improve power allocation betweencompression and transmission for maximizing the battery life of sensors. We know that thereexists a large redundancy in sensor's data. So data need to be compressed before beingtransmitted to the sink/receiver/customer for reducing the heavy amount of energy consumedin transmission; but wireless sensor are very limited to computational ability; memory andenergy. Due to these limitations; it becomes a sincere issue while processing anycompression algorithm on the data because this also requires a significant amount of energyto perform these operations but even so; for a single bit; the energy used for compression isusually less than that of transmission.

Sensitivity Studies Using Globes,Jyoti Tripathi; Vipin Bhatnanagar; Ashok Kumar; JS Shahi,Neutrino oscillation occurs if neutrinos have masses and if they mix among each other.

Neutrino oscillation in matter is probably the reason for the observed deficitof solar neutrino flux. The search for neutrino oscillation is the only way to investigate evenfor very small difference of neutrino masses. The evidence of small but non vanishingneutrino masses represent one of the few clear indications of the physics beyond standardmodel.

Molecular sex identification of red panda (Ailurus fulgens) suitable for noninvasive genetic studies,Arun Kumar; Bhupen Roka; Upashna Rai; P Anuradha Reddy,Abstract Molecular sexing of wild animals is feasible with differential amplification of X-and Y-homologous regions of various genes. We present a simple and robust technique for sexidentification of red panda suitable for noninvasive studies based on sex-specific fragmentsize polymorphism in amelogenin (AMEL) gene. Sequence analysis of AMELX and AMELYrevealed an 18-bp deletion in Y fragment which was used to differentially amplify 217 bp ofX and 199 bp of Y fragments. The designed primer pair is very sensitive and exhibitspolymerase chain reaction (PCR) success rates of 89 and 78% at 0.1 and 0.01 ng templateDNA concentrations; respectively. Further; we amplified poor quality faecal DNA with 94%success rate and average dropout rate of 15.6%.

Arginylation as a new link between oxidative stress response and prostate cancer progression,Fangliang Zhang; Michael D Birnbaum; Akhilesh Kumar; William M Morgan,In this study; we evaluate the role of post-translational arginylation in prostate cancer; andintroduce its potential as a biomarker of prostate cancer progression. Arginylation has notyet been studied in cancer. Our lab has observed Aringyltransferase (Ate1) is required foroxidative stress-mediated apoptosis. Our preliminary data in multiple eukaryotic cell modelsdemonstrate that a downregulation of Ate1 increases resistance to oxidative stress; andelevated Ate1 is sufficient to induce cell death. Preliminary data mining shows that adownregulation of Ate1 correlates with a poorer prognosis in prostate cancer. Becauseprostate cancer cells produce a high amount of oxidative stress; the decrease of Ate1 likelyincreases their survival. We hypothesize that Ate1 is essential for the normal cellularresponse to insurmountable oxidative stress leading to apoptosis; and that a …,*,2015,*

GPS Refinement in Cities Using Statistical Approach,Ashwani Kumar,Abstract: GPS plays an important role in everyday life for safe and convenient transportation.While pedestrians use hand held devices to know their position in a city; vehicles inintelligent transport systems use relatively sophisticated GPS receivers for estimating theircurrent position. However; in urban areas where the GPS satellites are occluded by tallbuildings; trees and reflections of GPS signals from nearby vehicles; GPS positionestimation becomes poor. In this work; an exhaustive GPS data is collected at a single pointin urban area under different times of day and under dynamic environmental conditions.

Polarized emission from single CdSe/CdS nanocrystals coupled to a 1D gold grating and a disordered structure,F Eloi; TPL Ung; H Frederich; D Canneson; B Bérini; X Quélin; JP Hermier; S Buil; A Kumar; A Bouhelier; JC Weeber; G Colas des Francs; M Nasilowski; C Javaux; B Dubertret,The possibility to grow thick CdS shells on CdSe core nanocrystals with variable thicknessesoffers a way to control the emission of nanocrystals. First of all it is possible to get very lowflickering fluorescence. Single photon sources or multiexcitonic emitters can be obtained bycontrolling Auger processes that depend on the shell thickness. This emission can also becontrolled by coupling the nanocrystal to plasmonic structures. In this case the shell acts asa spacer; preventing quenching of the fluorescence. We have previously shown thatCdSe/CdS QDs fluorescence can be dramatically modified by semi continuous gold films atthe percolation threshold presenting hot spots [1]. The decay rate enhancement;corresponding to the Purcell factor can reach values as high as 200.

Arginyltransferase (Ate1) is a Pro-apoptotic Enzyme Essential for Stress Response,Akhilesh Kumar; Michael Birnbaum; Fangliang Zhang,Abstract Arginylation consists of addition of an extra arginine to an existing peptide chain;thus changing the de facto primary sequence as well as the surface change. This process isevolutionarily conserved and mainly mediated by arginyltransferase (Ate1). While earlierstudies found that the overall arginylation activity often increases during stressing conditionsincluding heat shock; oxidative stress; and injury; little is known about the role of arginylationor Ate1 in stress response. By using multiple types of eukaryotic cells as test models; wefound that Ate1 is a pro-apoptotic factor. Knockout of Ate1 in cells leads to a retardation ofstress response and the diminish of apoptosis and cell death during exposure of high dosesof various stressing factors including heat shock; oxidative and osmotic stress; and heavymetal. Oppositely; over-expression of Ate1 leads to cell death in an Aif1-dependent and …,The FASEB Journal,2015,*

Mechanical and structure studies of Zr50Cu50 glass matrix composites during nano-indentation-a molecular dynamics study,Ashwani Kumar; Natraj Yedla,Abstract In this paper we report molecular dynamics simulations of nano-indentation on Zr50 Cu 50 metallic glass matrix composite (14% crystalline volume fraction) at various strainrates. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of strain rate on the deformationbehaviour and understand the deformation mechanism during deformation. Structuralanalysis during deformation is done by centro-symmetry parameter (CSP) studies. The load-displacement plots are drawn for the loading portion of indentation to analyze thedeformation behaviour. It is found that strain rate has significant effect on the nature of theload-displacement plot. With increasing strain rate serrations decreased and flat load-displacement regime is observed with progress of indentation (~ 10 Å) at strain rate of 1× 1011 s− 1.

The searches are based on the M[subscript T2] variable; which is a measure of the transverse momentum imbalance in anevent. The data were collected with the CMS detector and correspond to an integratedluminosity of 19.5 fb [superscript− 1]. Two related searches are performed.

Fast & Dynamic Image Restoration using Laplace equation Based Image Inpainting,Nitin Agrawal; Prashant Sinha; Avnish Kumar; Shobha Bagai,ABSTRACT Images tend to degenerate over time and are exposed to noises. These noisesdon't only affect the visual outlook but also hampers the allied significance to these images.Different techniques are being put to use for de-noising such images. Image in-painting isone such phenomenon of denoising the images that involves approximating the de-noisedform of the image. The current study aims at developing an in-painting system for restorationof lost art; reconstruction of destroyed images and removal of unnecessary objects. Themotivation for the same has been driven from Partial differential equation based anisotropicdiffusion model or image in-painting. The steady state heat equation or the Laplace equationhas been used to model and approximate the de-noised data for noised region of the image.The Laplace equation has been used clubbed with the Dirichlet boundary conditions in …,Journal of Undergraduate Research and Innovation,2015,*

In-silico prediction of cis-regulatory elements and functional domains of salt-stress ESTs in Glycine max.,AK Mishra; O Chakraborty; B Pandey; C Tyagi; A Singh; A Kumar; AK Jain,Abstract: Glycine max (Soybean) is a nutritionally important crop which provides anabundant source of oil and protein for global human consumption. Soil salinity is one of themajor environmental stresses which cause a significant loss of productivity in worldagriculture; especially in irrigated lands. The productivity of soybean is also significantlyhampered by salinity stress; thus reducing the yield by imposing negative impact on growthand agronomic traits. Salinity stress comes from genes that limit the rate of salt uptake fromthe soil and the transport of salt throughout the plant. The present report identifies the saltstress responsive genes and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in soybean by using in-silico approaches on the contigs derived from assembling ESTs from public domain.

A Parallel Architecture with Novel Filtering and Data Accessing Order for Deblocking Filter in H. 264/Svc Using Reconfigurable Architecture,I Manju; A Senthil Kumar,Abstract: In this paper we present a parallel filtering architecture with novel filtering and dataaccessing order for deblocking filter in H. 264/SVC. The deblocking filter is the complex partin H. 264/SVC which consumes more computation time and it has to adapt for normalfiltering (PAFF); MBAFF filtering and inter-layer prediction. The filtering order of MBAFFcoded frames has to support all combinations of field/frame mode for current and adjacentMB to filter a macroblock which increases the complexity of deblocking filter. The proposedfiltering architecture adapts efficiently for the MBAFF coded frames by reducing thecomplexity; results in faster filtering of a macroblock. Implementing the filter architecture inreconfigurable platform helps in faster adaptability to normal filtering operation and MBAFFfiltering. The proposed deblocking filter architecture is implemented in Cyclone V …,Informacije MIDEM,2015,*

MGF Based Closed Form Solution for Channel Capacity over Generalized-G Fading under MRC Diversity Combining,Rahul Kumar; Amit Kumar; S Pratap Singh,Channel capacity has been greatest challenge for the researchers in the field of wirelesscommunication. Capacity analysis and its improvement have been proposed under variousscenarios. However; most of them are based on conventional PDF based techniques; sometimes which render very complex analysis. Analysis becomes more difficult when diversitycombining is used for performance improvement. Keeping the above fact in mind in thispaper; we have analyzed the capacity of a channel by using the maximal-ratio combing(MRC) diversity scheme over Generalized-G fading channels. Moreover; we have usedmoment generating function (MGF) based approach to overcome complexity. Using the MGFof Generalized G fading distribution; we have derived closed form expression for channelcapacity under MRC schemes.

Posttranslational arginylation is essential for stress response (555.15),Akhilesh Kumar; Fangliang Zhang,Abstract Arginylation consists of addition of an extra arginine to an existing peptide chain;thus changing the de facto primary sequence as well as the surface change. This process isevolutionarily conserved and mainly mediated by arginyltransferase1 (Ate1). While earlierstudies found that the overall arginylation activity often increases during stressing conditionsincluding heat shock; oxidative stress; and injury; little is known about the role of arginylationor Ate1 in stress response. By using multiple types of eukaryotic cells as test models; wefound that Ate1 is a pro-apoptotic factor. Knockout of Ate1 in cells leads to a retardation ofstress response and the diminish of apoptosis and cell death during exposure of high dosesof various stressing factors including heat shock; oxidative and osmotic stress; and heavymetal. Oppositely; over-expression of Ate1 leads to cell death. Intriguingly; we also found …,The FASEB Journal,2014,*

The extinction model studied in this analysis is motivated by the search forsignatures of strong gravity at the TeV scale (terascale gravity) and assumes the existence ofstring couplings in the strong-coupling limit. In this limit; the string model predicts thesuppression of all high-transverse-momentum standard model processes; including jetproduction; beyond a certain energy scale. To test this prediction; the measured transverse-momentum spectrum is compared to the theoretical prediction of the standard model.

Japanese Encephalitis: A Veterinary Perspective,Dhanze Himani; HB Chethan Kumar; KN Bhilegaonkar; A Kumar,Abstract Japanese encephalitis is one of the most important arboviral zoonoses caused byJapanese encephalitis virus of Flaviviridae family. The virus cause huge mortality in childrenin several Asian countries. The virus circulates among birds and pigs and gets transmitted tohumans through mosquito bite. The children below 15 year of age are highly susceptibleand affected children suffer from neurological sequel. The virus causes abortion in sows;encephalitis in horses; however other species of animals remain asymptomatic. Theincreased paddy cultivation; presence of pigs near human dwelling; change in climate andpresence of unvaccinated human host contributes to the incidence of the disease. Therefore;vaccination of susceptible population; vector control; early diagnosis and treatment andcontinuous serosurveillance in animals are the keys to combat this crippling disease.,Journal of Foodborne and Zoonotic Diseases| October-December,2014,*

Cryptographic Schemes based on Elliptic Curves over Integer Rings,Sanjay Kumar; SK Pal; Ajay Kumar,Public key cryptographic schemes are normally based on the difficulty of solving a trapdoorone-way function. Schemes based on integer factorization; discrete logarithm; quadraticresiduosity and subset-sum problem are quite common in practice. Cryptographic schemesbased on elliptic curves over finite fields have recently gained importance due to theirattractive key size requirements and their ability to provide desired levels of security withlesser computations. Security of such schemes relies on the difficulty of solving the discretelog problem on an elliptic curve. Properties of elliptic curve over algebraic rings have alsobeen studied in the past. However; elliptic curves over integer rings have been very recentlyexplored for their applications in cryptography. Unlike previous ECC schemes; the points onsuch curves do not form a group and hence require different construction of algebraic …,INROADS-An International Journal of Jaipur National University,2014,*

EMI Reduction Techniques for Mobile Communication Devices,Akhilesh Kumar; Anurag Govind Rao,This paper describes the types of EMI and its reduction techniques for mobilecommunication devices. Initially electromagneticinterference (EMI) is generated due toparasitic effect of passive elements in switching devices; it generates commonmode (CM)and differentialmode (CM) types of noise. Both are known as conducted EMI. Second type ofEMI is radiated. Radiated EMI can be generated outside the device or inside the device andit doesn't need a wire for transmitting. Both types of EMI harm the device abruptly andmalfunction occurs. The maximum limit of EMI is decided by the FCC standards. So we haveto reduce the EMI noise in such a manner that it follows the FCC standards. Radiated EMIcan be reduced by using a proper shielding method and conducted EMI can be reduced bydesigning the EMI filter for both CM and DM noise. Thus; here we describe various types …,Journal of Innovation in Electronics and Communication Engineering,2013,*

A multiresolution approach for color image inpainting using an efficient generalized expectation maximization (GEM) model,R Gomathi; A Vincent Antony Kumar,In this paper; we present a novel expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for automaticcolor image inpainting using a new discrete multi scale directional sparse representationcalled the discrete shearlet transform (DST). It is now acknowledged that the traditionalwavelets are not very effective when dealing the multi dimensional signals havingdistributed discontinuities such as edges. To achieve a more efficient representation; onehas to use basis elements with much higher directional sensitivity. Using a shearlettransform combines the power of multi scale methods with a unique ability to capture thegeometry of multidimensional data and is optimally efficient in representing images withedges. The inpainting can be viewed as an interpolation or estimation problem with missingdata. Towards this goal; we propose the idea of using expectation maximization (EM) …,International Journal of Physical Sciences,2012,*

Plasmapause and Increase in Whistler Mode Wave’s Growth,Ashwani Kumar; Anil Kumar; DP Singh,Abstract: Singh et al have studied in detail the Whistler mode VLF waves intensityenhancement; by assuming change in VII; volume of flux tube; EII change due to a change ofposition of plasmapause. Enhancing this work; we in place of energy increase; consider thewave growth increase of whistler mode waves. The results are in agreement with reportedobservations and suggest that plasmapause plays an important role in wave propagation. Itis shown that this guidance is possible at both the inner and outer edges of thePlasmapause and that more efficient guide occurs as the Plasmapause gradients becomestronger. In the case of strong gradients; waves coming from a wide latitudes range (~ 80)are focused tightly about the plasmapause field lines; resulting in a wave intensity increaseof about 3dB near the magnetic equator plane12.

A Novel Approach to Use ZnO Thin Film as a Switching in Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) Cell,Amit Kumar; Manoj Kumar; Beer Pal Singh,ABSTRACT Resistance switching random access memory (RRAM) has drawn considerableattention for the application in non-volatile memory element in semiconductor memorydevices. A ZnO thin film now assumed to be useful for dynamic random access memory(DRAM) cell. In this paper we provide a framework to its use as a switching ON or OFF inDRAM cell. In this type of memory cell the ZnO thin film has a lot of importance instead of atransistor. Inside the DRAM cell; we are suggested to use the ZnO thin film due to its reliableand repeated switching of the resistance. Thus after the replacement of ZnO thin film as aswitching element instead of a transistor; the DRAM cell has a strong resistance switchingcapability.,International Journal of Computer Applications,2012,*

Feasibility to irradiate cobalt bundles in PHWR for production of Cobalt-60,Gaurav Agrawal; Surendra Mishra; Sherly Ray; AS Pradhan; AN Kumar,This paper presents the feasibility to irradiate cobalt-59 bundles in 220 MWe Indian PHWR.The adjuster rods of 220 MWe Indian PHWRs are made of cobalt-59; but the production ofcobalt-60 can be augmented by loading few cobalt bundle in PHWR core. The limitation withcobalt adjuster irradiation is that the production of cobalt-60 having specific activity higherthan 200 Ci/gm is not possible because of their location in the core. To facilitate theproduction of cobalt-60 having specific activity about 250-350 Ci/gm and in short period ofirradiation time (2-7 years); the irradiation of cobalt bundles in the higher flux region in thecore is explored. Cobalt-59 has high neutron absorption cross section and hence affects theneutron flux distribution in the core to a great extent.

PRE-TRANSCRIPTIONAL GENE SILENCING TECHNIQUE FOR CONTROLLING SKIN CANCER,A Noushadali; Bharath Parimalam; R Radhika Devi; S Shilpa; A Suresh Kumar; PK Krishnan Namboori,Abstract Familial cancers; which are in general incapable of exhibiting symptoms at the earlyonset period of the disease; can become fatal if left undiagnosed. Such cancers turn out tobe a great threat through many generations in the long run. The remedial alternative to thisis treatment at the genetic level which quite obviously points out to gene therapy. In thiswork; gene therapy proposed at the pre-transcriptional level intends to silence mutation ofthe target gene; thereby inhibiting or silencing gene expression in the form of a defectiveprotein. Skin cancer; the second most common type of cancers widespread across theglobe; has been considered for our studies.

Besides an increasing number of fractional quantum Hall states;there are also eight reentrant integer quantum Hall states observed. These reentrant integerstates are currently not understood; although they are believed to be collective insulatorsakin to the field induced Wigner solid with one or more electrons per site. These states arestrongly affected by tilt in magnetic field and carrier density but surprisingly there is verylimited data on their temperature dependence. We present a detailed study of the melting ofthe reentrant integer quantum Hall states of the second Landau level from which we extractthe phase diagram in the temperature versus filling factor plane. We find that the meltingtemperatures of the various reentrant integer states violate the particle-hole symmetry. We …,APS Meeting Abstracts,2011,*

Sequence analysis of a part of hypervariable region of VP2 gene of chicken embryo fibroblast adapted Infectious Bursal Disease virus isolates of Uttarakhand,A Kumar; V Umapathi,ABSTRACT Infectious bursal disease (IBD) is an acute and highly contagiousimmunosuppressive viral disease of young chickens causing great economic loss to thepoultry industry worldwide. The disease is caused by serotype 1 of IBD virus (IBDV)belonging to genus Avibirnavirus of family Birnaviridae. One of the most probable reasonsfor frequent vaccination failures is attributed to emergence of variant or very virulent strains.Hence the present study was carried out in an attempt to characterize the chicken embryofibroblast culture (CEF) adapted IBD isolates which was originally characterized as veryvirulent in nature at molecular level. Amplification of 248 bp hyper variable region of VP2gene was done by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using specificprimers with RNA isolated from CEF culture infected with these field isolates.

J-Curve Hypothesis of Productivity and Output Growth: A Case Study of Indian Manufacturing in the Post Reforms Period,Danish A Hashim; Ajay Kumar; Arvind Virmani,Majority of the studies estimating productivity in the Indian organized manufacturing sectorhave reported a slowdown in productivity growth in the 1990s; baffling the analysts as thiscame in backdrop of major economic reforms that were initiated in 1991. Some felt thatproductivity could respond to reforms with a time lag but could not explain theoretically as towhy it plummeted. Tracing the phenomena to the J-curve hypothesis; the present paperattempts to provide a theoretical explanation for the dip in productivity and output growth inearly phases of reforms and estimate if the reforms displayed a positive impact in laterperiod. The underlying reasons for J-curve hypothesis are provided mainly in terms oftechnological gap (compared to the global benchmark) and relatively weak mobility offactors of production (like labour; capital; industrial/urban land etc) including those that …,Indian Economic Review,2011,*
Reduced models of networks of coupled enzymatic reactions and linearization of Michaelis-Menten differential equations,Ajit Kumar,Abstract The Michaelis-Menten scheme has played a central role in our understanding ofbiochemical processes. It has long been understood how this scheme can be used toapproximate the dynamics of irreversible enzymatic reactions. However; a similarapproximation in the case of networks; where the product of one reaction can act as anenzyme in another; has not been fully developed. In this thesis such an approximation isdeveloped for a class of coupled enzymatic networks where the individual interactions are ofMichaelis-Menten type. In addition; sufficient conditions for the validity of the total Quasi-Steady State Assumption (tQSSA); obtained in a single protein case by Borghans; de Boer;and Segel are extended to sufficient conditions that guarantee the validity of the tQSSA for alarge class of enzymatic networks.

Self-trapping mechanism in green phosphorescent dye-doped polymer light-emitting diodes,Devinder Madhwal; SS Rait; A Verma; A Kumar; M Onoda; PK Bhatnagar; PC Mathur,Abstract The mechanism for exciting electroluminescence (EL) in a green phosphorescentdye; iridium (III) tris (2-(4-tolyl) pyridinato-N; C 2)(Ir (mppy) 3); doped in a host blue-emittingconducting polymer; poly [9; 9-di-n-hexyl-fluorenyl-2; 7-diyl](PFO); has been studied.Photoluminescence measurements have been made on PFO/Ir (mppy) 3 (0–12%)composites to rule out the possibility of singlet exciton energy transfer from the host polymerto the green dye. EL measurements have also been made to study the behavior of thecomposites in the presence of dc bias. The dominant mechanism for energy transfer fromPFO to Ir (mppy) 3 is found to be self-trapping of the charge carriers in the dye molecules;due to the extremely low LUMO and high HOMO levels as compared with PFO; therebyproducing EL in the green region.,Physica Scripta,2010,*

Observation of a Fractional Quantum Hall State in the second Landau level of a two-dimensional hole system,A Kumar; N Samkharadze; MJ Manfra; LN Pfeiffer; KW West; GA Csathy,Abstract We report on a dc transport measurement of an exceptional two-dimensional holesystem in a Carbon-doped GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well. In a setup which is similar to that ofRef.[1] our sample and the attached sintered silver heat exchangers are immersed into a He-3 bath which can be cooled to 5 mK. The most striking feature of this sample is the presenceof a fractional quantum Hall state at Landau level filling factor nu= 2+ 2/3 with an energy gapof 40mK. This state has only been observed in electron samples so far. While in electronsamples the nu= 2+ 2/3 state is always observed together with the nu= 2+ 1/3 state; the latterone is not present in our hole sample. We compare our results with results of previousstudies in electron systems and we examine the role of the disorder and of the Landau levelmixing on the activation energy gap.[1] W. Pan; J.-S. Xia; V.

The coarse-grained sample of Ti-6Al-4V was compressed from each of the three sides; sequentially atan elevated temperature which constitutes one set of forging. Such set of compression wascarried out for two more times by progressively decreasing the temperatures. The hugeaccumulated strain imposed on the specimen reduced the grain size to~ 7 μm; which isattractive for superplastic forming and also for improved strength and toughness.[ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of IUP Journal of Mechanical Engineering is theproperty of IUP Publications and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites orposted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

Power Control Device and Storm Security for Savonius Rotor,Kunal Ghosh; Kuchimanchi K Bharadwaj; Alok Kumar; Sarfaraz Ahmad; Swati Saxena,The main disadvantage of a Savonius rotor has been its failure to control its power andsurvive in high winds. A built-in device is developed that provides automatic power controland storm security. This consists of a window on each cup of the Savonius and its spring-loaded shutter that opens centrifugally when a certain rpm is exceeded. A technique forpower measurement that employs a wind tunnel balance and the brake-dynamometerprinciple is developed. A rotor with this device is tested in a wind tunnel under differentbrake loads; spring tensions and wind speeds. The shutters open reliably to limit rpm andpower; the open shutters reduce drag on the rotor and these features should offer protectionfrom centrifugal forces and wind thrust in a storm. Increased shutter spring tension resultedin higher power coefficient. The rotor could not be subjected to extreme winds in the wind …,Wind Engineering,2009,*
Anomalous absorption in thioformaldehyde,Amit Kumar; Suresh Chandra; MK Sharma,Absorption against the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB); called the anomalousabsorption; is an unusual phenomenon. The transition 111 110 at 4.829 GHz offormaldehyde (H2CO) was the rst one showing the anomalous absorption. The c-C3H2 isthe second molecule showing anomalous absorption through its transition 220 211 at21.590 GHz. Structure of thioformaldehyde (H2CS) is very similar to that of the H2CO.Therefore; we have investigated about the physical conditions under which the transition111 110 at 1.0465 GHz of H2CS would be found in anomalous absorption in cool cosmicobjects. As in case of H2CO; the anomalous absorption of 111 110 of H2CS is foundsensitive to the relative collisional rates and it requires that the collisional rate for thetransition 111 211 must be smaller than that for the transition 110 212.,*,2009,*

Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Homocysteine Metabolism Pathway Genes,Jitender Kumar; Gaurav Garg; Arun Kumar; Elayanambi Sundaramoorthy; Krishna Rao Sanapala; Saurabh Ghosh; DM Ganesan Karthikeyan,Background—An elevated level of homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinemia) has beenimplicated as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Deficiency of dietaryfactors like vitamin B12; folate; and genetic variations can cause hyperhomocysteinemia.The prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in the Indian population is likely to be highbecause most Indians adhere to a vegetarian diet; deficient in vitamin B12. In thebackground of vitamin B12 deficiency; variations in genes involved in homocysteinemetabolism might have a greater impact on homocysteine levels. Methods and Results—Wegenotyped 44 nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) from 11 genesinvolved in homocysteine metabolism and found only 14 to be polymorphic.

Design of linear phase 2 dimensional FIR filter: A new approach,Sunil Bhooshan; Vinay Kumar; A Raghavendra Kumar; Meenu Jain; RVarun Choudary; Rohini Mukhopadhyay; S Bharat Kumar,With the rapid development in the field of image processing and sonar signal processing;etc.; the design of 2 dimensional (2D) digital filters has become very important. The inherentstability of 2D finite impulse response (FIR) filters makes them preferred over infinite impulseresponse (IIR) filters. These 2DFIR filters may have linear phase. l Various techniques have beendiscussed in the liter- ature to design 2DFIR digital filters. If we use least square (LS) errorcriterion; an overshoot of the frequency response at the passband and the stopband edges occurdue to Gibb's phenomenon [1]; [2]; [3]; [4]; whereas; a minmax design approach results in anequiripple solution. When 1DFIR filter design is compared with 2DFIR filter design the numberof design variables increase from 0{N) to 0{N2); where (Nl) is the order of the filter [5]; [6]; [7].Another way of designing 2DFIR filters is by using transformations.

The Relative Distribution of Free and Bound Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMPs) Enzymes in Human Bruch’s Membrane,A Kumar; A El-Osta; AA Hussain; J Marshall,Purpose:: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs); released by the retinal pigment epithelium(RPE) enter Bruch's to form the degradative arm of a remodeling process for maintaining thestructural integrity of the membrane. However; ageing is associated with accumulation ofinactive MMPs and the increased thickness of Bruch's suggests impaired degradation andremodeling. The present investigation was designed to assess the possibility that theseMMP enzymes may become sequestered and therefore unable to carry out their functionalrole (activation and degradation) leading to the observed ageing of Bruch's membrane.Methods:: Freshly isolated Bruch's-choroid preparations (14 eyes; age range 45-86 years)were mounted in Ussing chambers and MMP elution was instigated by application of ahydrostatic pressure of 14-16mmHg.

A centrifugal pump designed to handle solid-liquid mixtures is normally singlestage; end suction type having radial and mixed flow configuration to facilitate the motion ofsolid particles. Some of the special features of the centrifugal slurry pumps are larger flowpassages to accommodate solid particles; robust impeller with lesser number of vanes;special seals and proper material of construction to ensure longer life. These have to beoperated with relatively wide clearance at impeller-casing contacts to minimize choking andlocalized wear.

Bacterial Interactions with CdSe Quantum Dots,P Holden; JL Nadeau; A Kumar; S Clarke; JH Priester; GD Stucky,Abstract Cadmium selenide quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanoparticles that aremanufactured for biomedical imaging; photovoltaics; and other applications. While metallicnanoparticles can be made biotically by bacteria and fungi; and thus occur in nature; the fateof either natural or engineered QDs and relationships to nanoparticle size; conjugate andbiotic conditions are mostly unknown. Working with several different bacterial strains andQDs of different sizes and conjugate chemistries; including QDs synthesized by a Fusariumfungal strain; we show that QDs can enter cells through specfic receptor-mediatedprocesses; that QDs are broken down by bacteria during cell association; and that toxicity tocells is much like that imposed by Cd (II) ions. The mechanisms of entry and toxicity are notfully understood; but preliminary evidence suggests that electron transfer between cells …,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,2007,*

With technology scaling; lower supply voltages are required to limit active powerdissipation; excessive electric field & gate oxide leakage. Threshold voltage scaling hasreached to a limit. Low threshold voltage results in excessive leakage [1]. Apart from devicelevel tailoring; circuit design efforts are ongoing for leakage reduction in standby as well asactive mode. We are presenting a methodology for reduced leakage databus which usessplit supply rails. Compared to conventional power down methods; scheme is better in termsof leakage reduction; noise margin & reactivation time.

Hence neutron monitoring and reactor protection is throughspecial startup counters located either incore and/or in the calandria vault. The incorecounters are expected to respond to the changes in the neutron flux during the stage ofmoderator filling itself. The observed increments in the count rates during this stage are;however; very small due to low neutron source strength and small subcritical multiplication.Because of these reasons; there is a lot of concern among the reactor physicists monitoringthis activity on the counters.

Use of gadolinium as neutron poison in 540 MWe PHWR,PK Nag; MPS Fernando; AN Kumar,In Pressurised heavy water reactors (PHWRs); neutron poison in the moderator is used tocompensate the excess reactivity present in the core on different occasions such as xenondecay during synchronization just after poison out period or start ups from xenon freeconditions. It is also used in secondary shutdown system (SDS-2); where required amount ofneutron poison is injected directly into the moderator within 2.5 seconds. Further; it is alsoused for over poisoning the moderator to achieve the guaranteed shutdown state when theregular shutdown systems are taken for maintenance. Generally; two types of moderatorpoisons are used in power reactors to balance the reactivity of the core and they are boronand gadolinium.

Operation of existing 220 MWe PHWR at reduced power level,Surendra Mishra; Sherly Ray; AN Kumar,Reactor operates in the equilibrium core configuration for most of its life time. In equilibriumcore configuration; the rate of refueling remains almost constant and the characteristics ofthe core remain unchanged with time. Thus in the design stage itself; the ideal equilibriumburnup distribution is finalized for a specified bundle shift scheme and the channel powerdistribution obtained is used for providing the coolant flow along the channels. In the middleof the year 2003; there was a proposal to operate the reactors at reduced power like 70% FPor 90% FP to meet the reduced requirement of the grid. Studies pertaining to equilibriumcore have been carried out for 70% FP and 90% FP operation. For low power operation thedegree of flux flattening can be reduced; there by increasing the average discharge burnup.Reduced xenon load and reduced fuel temperature also contribute to the improvement of …,*,2006,*

Large scale usage of depleted uranium bundles in Indian PHWRS,Sherly Ray; Surendra Mishra; AN Kumar,Indian PHWRs are designed to operate with natural uranium (NU) as the main fuel. Earlier inthe initial fresh core; to achieve flux flattening and hence to operate the reactor at designrated power; limited number of depleted uranium bundles were loaded in the central portionof the core. Presently even in fresh core about 40% of the core is loaded with depleteduranium bundles (∼ 0.6 wt% 235 U) from the consideration of conserving the naturaluranium fuel. This is achieved by loading most of the depleted bundles in the peripherallocations of the channels. Successful operation with large number of DU bundles in the freshcore has been proven in MAPS-2 and MAPS-1cores after EMCCR as well as in TAPP-4. Inthese three reactors 100% FP was possible even with 40% DU bundles in the core. In TAPP-4 and 3 initial core; depleted bundles of 0.36 wt% 235 U are also loaded to conserve the …,*,2006,*

Ergonomic Evaluation of Hand Tools Injuries among Indian Farmers,Adarsh Kumar; JK Singh; Dinesh Mohan; Mathew Varghese,There are 800 million hand tools used on Indian farms by 260 million farm workers. Thisstudy was done in survey of two phases. In the first phase; data on agricultural relatedinjuries was collected from nine contiguous villages in a total population of 19;723 persons.In the second phase of study 21 more villages were added and population covered in was78;890. A total of 576 and 282 agricultural injuries were reported in Phase-I and Phase-IIrespectively. Hand tools accounted for 332 (58%) and 54 (19%) of total agricultural injuriesin the two phases of survey respectively. Most of the injuries ie 98% and 91% of the handtool injuries caused were AIS 1 (45% and 17% of the total AIS 1 injuries) in Phase I and II.70% of AIS 1 hand tool injuries had a recovery time of more than 7 days in Phase I. In phaseII; all AIS 1 injuries took more than 7 days to recover. The mechanism of injuries was …,Journal of Agricultural Engineering,2006,*

Japanese B Encephalitis,Anil Kumar; Vineet Bhushan Gupta,Japanese B encephalitis; a zoonotic viral disease; is the only identified virus leading toepidemic encephalitis in India. The disease; spread by culicine mosquitoes; is maintained inanimals and birds; particularly pigs and ardied birds; humans being dead-end hosts.Worldwide; approximately 35;000–50;000 symptomatic cases develop per year. Most of theinfected cases remain subclinical and out of the symptomatic patients only a minoritydevelop neurologic dysfunction. The incubation period ranges from 4–14 days; which isfollowed by a prodrome of fever; headache; nausea followed by altered mental status andneurologic features like seizures.

IPC Code: H01L27/00,Sangeeta Singh; RK Shukla; A Kumar,The common feature of chalcogenide glasses is the presence of localized states in themobility gap due to the absence of long-range order as well as various inherent structuraldefects. These glasses when exposed to light having photon energy comparable to the bandgap; exhibit a number of interesting changes 1-4. On the basis of mode of induction; photoinduced phenomenon in chalcogenide glasses can be grouped into three categories: thephoton mode in which the photo electronic excitation directly induces atomic structuralchanges. An example is the photo darkening changes 5-7 in which light illumination inducesa red shift in the optical absorption edge; so that the sample becomes darker; while the redshift can be reversed with annealing of the glasses. Sample volume; elastic and chemicalproperties also change with illumination. The photo thermal mode; in which photo …,Indian Journal of Engineering & Materials Sciences,2005,*

While diabetic thrombocytopathy iswell recognized; it remains unclear if increased platelet aggregability seen in diabetesmellitus (DM) impacts the magnitude of IPA achieved with clopidogrel. Our study assesseswhether DM impacts the degree of IPA induced by high-dose clopidogrel loading in patientswith stable coronary artery disease. The secondary analysis investigated the correlationbetween achieved IPA and both glycemic control (HbA1C) and systemic inflammation (hs-CRP). Methods IPA was quantified in 16 patients (7 DM; 9 non-DM) undergoing electivecardiac catheterization using a novel point-of-care assay (RUOP2Y12; Accumetrics) whichmeasures IPA as a function of light transmittance to 4 μmol iso-TRAP and 20 μmol ADP …,*,2005,*

Persistent photoconductivity in a-Se 90 Ge 10-x In x thin films,Sangeeta Singh; RK Shukla; A Kumar,Transient photoconductivity has been studied in amorphous Se 90 Ge 10-x In x thin filmsprepared by vacuum evaporation. It is observed that the decay of photoconductivity is quiteslow in these samples. A persistent photoconductivity; with an extremely slow decay rate isalso observed during decay process. The magnitude of persistent photoconductivityincreases with increase in illumination time; intensity of light and temperature of the films.The results indicate that some kind of photo induced structural changes occur in thesesamples; which are of reversible nature and have time constants of a few hours. Studiesmade on various compositions under identical conditions show that the persistentphotoconductivity is minimum at 4 at.% of Indium.

Variational and numerical study of solution switching in two and three core couplers with higher-order perturbations.,Ajit Kumar,Abstract The given thesis is devoted to the study of soliton switching in two and threecorenonlinear directional couplers with Kerr as well as non-Kerr nonlinearity. The major part ofthe thesis deals with femtosecond soliton pulses. Because of this higher order dispersiveand nonlinear effects are taken into account. In particular the influence of third-orderdispersion; self-steepening and intrapulse Raman effect on switching characteristics isstudied in detail. Besides; the influence of coupling constant dispersion; arising out ofinteimodal dispersion between the symmetric and the anti-symmetric eigenmodes of thecoupler; on soliton switching is also taken into account. In the given context; both the powerinduced and phase-induced modes of switching have been investigated.,*,2005,*

Performance of Isolator Fed by Laval Nozzle,Amit Kumar; G Balu; S Panneerselvam; E Rathakrishnan,Abstract Performance of a rectangular isolator for supersonic combustion; fed by Lavalnozzles; was studied experimentally. The inlet Mach numbers considered at the entry of theisolator were 1.6; 1.8 and 2.0; and experiments were conducted for nozzle pressure ratio(NPR) of 5; 6; 7 and 8. The height to width ratio of the isolator considered was 1.2. Thebackpressure at the exit of the isolator was varied by partially blocking the flow at the exitplane of the isolator by a wedge. The blockage areas considered in this investigation were0%; 5% and 10% of isolator exit area. A series of oblique shocks termed as" oblique shock-train" was successfully established in the isolator duct; for certain combinations of flow andgeometric parameters of the present study. The wall static pressure along the length of theisolator and the pitot pressure at the exit plane have been measured for all the cases …,International Journal of Turbo and Jet Engines,2005,*
RIPOT: A triangulation based partitioning algorithm for global optimization,Y Wu; L Ozdamar; A Kumar,We propose a triangulation-based partitioning algorithm; TRIOPT; for solving low-dimensional bound-constrained black box global optimization problems. The method startsby forming a Delaunay triangulation of a given set of samples in the feasible domain; andthen; it assesses the simplices (partitions) obtained for re-partitioning. Function values at thevertices of each partition are mapped into the zero one interval by a nonlinear transformationfunction and their aggregate entropy is calculated. Based on this entropy; partitions that holda promise of containing the global optimum are re-partitioned according to differenttriangular splitting strategies; forming new partitions. These strategies are efficient in terms ofthe number of new function evaluations required per new partition. A novelty in the searchscheme proposed here is that once a partition narrows down to a small size; its vertices …,Computational and Applied Mathematics,2005,*

Prospects of Apple Based Hortipastoral System and Other Conventional Integrated Systems in Maintaining Floristic Diversity of Grasslands in Himachal Pradesh,JR Sharma; B Gupta; A Kumar,Abstract: In each system; 0.1 ha plot was demarcated to study the understorey changes infloristic diversity during July 2000 to October 2000. Nine grass species; one fern and twonon-legumes were recorded in the study sites. It was also observed that phytosociologicalcharacters of herbaceous vegetation like total density and basal area of plant communityshowed a decreasing trend from July to October. Further; these attributes achieved highervalues in natural and improved grasslands thereby revealing that trees affected thephytosociological attributes of herbage. Festuca rubra and Panicum maximum werecommon grasses in all the systems. Other species varied with the systems. On the basis ofimportance value index of constituent species; it was concluded that in pine basedsilvipastoral system the grassland can be designated as Festuca-Panicum-Dactylis type; …,VII International Symposium on Temperate Zone Fruits in the Tropics and Subtropics-Part Two 696,2003,*

Role of red cell selenium in recurrent pregnancy loss,KS Kumar; A Kumar; S Prakash,Selenium is an essential trace mineral required for normal human health and reproduction.In recent years selenium deficiency in humans has been implicated as a risk factor forrecurrent pregnancy loss. So far the selenium status in recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) hasbeen evaluated only in plasma and serum samples showing discrepancies of seleniumdeficiency as a cause for RPL. The present pilot study from India has evaluated seleniumstatus in red cells (as they are the better indicators of selenium levels) in 20 women withthree or more unexplained recurrent pregnancy losses compared to similar number ofcontrols. The mean+/-SD red cell selenium levels in the study group was found to be119.55+/-32.94 ng/ml (range 55-170 ng/ml); which was significantly lower compared to thecontrol group with a mean+/-SD of 150.85+/-37.63 ng/ml (range 87-225 ng/ml).

Enhanced Loading and Stability of Urease Covalently Attached to Polypyrrole Microspheres for Application to Urea Biosensor,A Gambhir; A Kumar; BD Malhotra; B Miksa; S Slomkowski,Abstract An electrode for measurement of urea; based on urease covalently attached topolypyrrole (PPY) microspheres immobilized on conducting polypyrrole polyvinylsulphonate (PPY-PVS) films has been described. Conducting polypyrrole polyvinylsulphonate films were prepared using indium-tin-oxide (ITO) glass plates as workingelectrode and standard calomel electrode as the reference electrode. The films weredeposited on ITO glass plates for 5–7 minutes at a constant current of 2mA (surface area1x1cm 2). Urease immobilized onto polypyrrole microspheres (by reaction of protein aminogroups with microsphere surface aldehyde groups of the surface of microspheres) wasentrapped/adsorbed on electrochemically prepared conducting polypyrrole polyvinylsulphonate films deposited on ITO.

Effectiveness of annular shield plate of end-shields of 220 MWe Indian PHWR,MV Gathibandhe; RA Agarwal; CG Utge; AS Pradhan; AN Kumar,Full text: The end-shields provided at each end of the calandria are cylindrical boxes. Theseboxes are pierced by 306 lattice tubes arranged in 22.86 cm square lattice. The inter spacesbetween lattice tubes are filled with carbon steel balls and water in the central portion andwater jacket in the periphery. As peripheral portion of the end shield does not have steelballs it is weak for gamma radiation. To strengthen this; an additional SS plate of 75 mmthick is provided towards calandria side. Shielding analysis for this is complicated and has tobe carried out by using 3-D computer codes. Computer code MCNP4a is used for thispurpose. Location of 75 mm steel plate is very important for its shielding effectiveness. Doserates can vary by a factor of 2.5 depending on location. Optimum location for this plate hasbeen studied. Variation of gamma dose rates on end-shield surface is also given,*,2002,*

On an indirect estimation of total fertility rate from open birth interval data.,RC Yadava; A Kumar,It is observed that for any population there exists a relationship between its fertility level andthe spacing pattern inherent in that population. This has led to the computation and analysisof different birth intervals which is quite common in any fertility study undertaken today.These birth intervals can be categorized into two broad types: the closed birth interval (CBI)being the time interval between successive live births to a woman and the open birth interval(OBI) the interval from the date of last live birth to the date of survey computed for eachwoman. Out of these types of birth intervals it is well established that OBI is a more powerfuland sensitive index of fertility than the CBI and that it is of particular value for themeasurement of fertility change in the developing countries like India with high birth rates.Some additional advantages of OBI over CBI is that since it is concerned only with the …,Demography India,2002,*

Geometrical factors for decay heat calculation in PHWR fuel,MV Gathibandhe; P Goverdhan; RA Agarwal; AS Pradhan; AN Kumar,Full text: Radioactive isotopes (fission products/actinides) are generated during reactoroperation. Even after reactor is shutdown; nuclear radiations are emitted during radioactivedecay of fission products formed in the fission process and actinides which are formed in theprocess of parasitic absorption of neutrons. During the traverse of these radiations throughmatter they collide with the nuclides/atoms of the matter and heat is generated. Heatgenerated during reactor shutdown due to absorption of nuclear radiations is known asdecay heat. β-heat is absorbed fully in the fuel material however about 15 to 20% of γ-heatescapes the fuel material. In this paper; decay heat produced in PHWR fuel has beencalculated using computer code ORIGEN-2. This code does not take into account thegeometry of fuel and structural materials. Therefore code MCNP4a was used to account …,*,2002,*

Mitogenic stimulation in isoproterenol treated cells of Dictyostelium discoideum,Akhilesh Kumar; Samar Chatterjee,Abstract Amoebae of the cellular slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum showed stimulatedmitogenic activity when exposed to 200μM isoproterenol; an activator of adenyl cyclase; for30min. Approximately 40% increase in cell proliferation was found at 48h after isoproterenoltreatment. A faster and larger plaque formation as well as higher uptake of FITC-labelled E.coli indicates greater phagocytotic activity in the treated cells. A concurrent increase in DNAand protein syntheses was also recorded in the treated cells. Administration of 400μMcaffeine or 200μM (+) propranolol brought down the isoproterenol-induced elevation in thecell division rate to control levels. These results are discussed in relation to a precociousactivation of adenyl cyclase in the treated cells leading to a transient but significant increasein cell division in this organism.,Cell biology international,2002,*

Geomorphological Aspects for Runoff Prediction in a Himalayan Catchment,Jitendra Sinha; JK Singh; Akhilesh Kumar,Abstract: The present study was undertaken to explore the geomorphological characteristicsof the catchment of river Bino; a tributary of Ramganga river; located in the Himalayan regionto develop a geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph (GIUH). The predictionperformance of the developed GIUH was evaluated by comparing the peak discharge (qp)and time to peak (tp). It was observed that the absolute prediction error (APE); absolutepercentage error (PE) for all estimated values of peak discharge and time to peak were; ingeneral; well within the acceptable limits. It was also found that the extent of the map scalehas a significant effect on the prediction performance of the developed model as it affects thevalues of some of the geomorphological parameters of the catchment.,12 th ISCO Conference Beijing,2002,*
Export Performance of Indian Fisheries Sector: Strengths and Challenges Ahead,PK Joshi; Anjani Kumar,The Fish and fish products have emerged as the largest group in agricultural exports ofIndia. The export of fish and fish products has jumped from a mere sum of US $10 million in1960-61 to about US $1300 million in 2000-01. The export basket of fisheries sector hasalso diversified over time. Four decades ago it began with the export of shrimp only and nowfisheries export basket consists of more than 60 items. Due to high importance of export offisheries sector it is important to analyze its performance and factors affecting the same.There is concern about impact of WTO and trade liberalization measures on exportperformance and competitiveness and how the fisheries sector will respond to a free marketeconomy and liberal trade regime. Still deeper is the concern as to the free trade regime willaffect fisheries sector; particularly small and poverty-ridden fishermen. This paper …,*,2002,*

Accidentally Detected Thyroid Hemiagenesis: A Rare Case &,Anamika Rathi; ML Meena; Amit Kumar; Abhijeet Singh; Anand Subash,Abstract Thyroid gland hemiagenesis is a rarely reported congenital anomaly whereindevelopmental failure of one of the thyroid lobe with or without isthmus can be seen. Itsprevalence ranges from 0.05%-0.2%. From these very few reported cases; a femalepreponderance has been noted. The left lobe appears to be more commonly affected thanthe right. Frequently these patients are hyperthyroid; but euthyroid and hypothyroid caseshave also been reported. Our objective here is to report a case; review the literature anddiscuss the management of these cases. The idea of this study started from an accidentallydetected case of left Hemithyroid agenesis when the literature review was done in PubMedusing key words like “congenital absence of thyroid lobe”;“Hemithyroid agenesis”;“thyroidhemiagenesis” and “absent thyroid gland”. We report a case of congenital absence of left …,J Pediatr,2000,*

Deviation from 3-D Ising critical behaviour in aqueous electrolyte solutions,A Kumar; J Jacob; BM Jaffar Ali,Abstract The near-critical behaviour in complex fluids; comprising electrolyte solutions;polymer solutions and amphiphilic systems; reveals a marked departure from the 3-D Isingbehaviour. This departure manifests itself either in terms of a crossover from Ising to mean-field (or classical) critical beliaviour; when moving away from a given critical point (Tc); or bythe persistence of only mean-field region in the surprisingly close vicinity ofTc. The non-Isingfeatures of the osmotic compressibility (% T;) in solutions of electrolytes; tliat exhibit one ormany liquid-liquid transitions; will be presented. The underlying cause of the breakdown ofthe anticipated 3-D Ising behaviour in aqueous electrolyte solutions is traced to thestructuring induced by the electrolytes. New evidence; constituting measurements of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and the excess molar volume; is advanced to support the …,Solid State Physics: Proceedings of the DAE Solid State Physics Symposium,1999,*

Fetal Iron Status in Maternal Anemia,PN Singla; M Tyagi; R Shankar; D Dash; A Kumar,In developing countries such as India; iron-deficiency anemia still is a significant publichealth problem. More than 85 percent of pregnant women in India may be affected. It haslong been thought that a maternal deficiency does not seriously compromise acquisition ofiron by the fetus; but a number of studies now have related maternal iron status to that of thenewborn infant. Low iron stores may dispose infants to becoming anemic; and this in turnmay limit their cognitive development. Iron deficiency also might impair cell-mediatedimmune function.Paired samples of maternal blood and cord blood were taken from 54anemic pregnant women whose hemoglobin was less than 110 gm/liter; and from 22 otherswho were not anemic. All participants had singleton live births at 37 to 41 weeks' gestation.The infants of anemic women had significantly low cord blood levels of hemoglobin …,Obstetrical & gynecological survey,1997,*

Arsenic Interstitial Complexes in Low-Temperature-Grown (LT) GaAs,CG Morgan; JI Landman; A Kumar; P Papoulias; M Kramer; JT Schick,Abstract Although EPR and absorption experiments have detected large concentrations ofAs antisites in as-grown LT GaAs; other point defects must also be present to account for therest of the excess As in this material. Using first principles Sankey-Niklewski moleculardynamics calculations; we find that the formation energies for As split interstitials are lowerthan the formation energy for Ga vacancies-although interstitials are expected to be quitemobile; and may be present primarily in small clusters and complexes. We find that a low-energy complex consisting of two extra As atoms sharing a vacant Ga site introducesconsiderably less lattice dilation per excess As than an isolated As split interstitial; inagreement with the small observed lattice dilation due to the excess As. This complex has alocalized resonance which may become a deep level in the gap at high pressure …,APS March Meeting Abstracts,1996,*

Queuing strategies for qos management of traffic between lans interconnected by low-speed wan links,A Kumar; TVJG Babu; SVR Anand,We provide a comparative performance evaluation of packet queuing and link admissionstrategies for low-speed wide area network Links (eg 9600 bps; 64 kbps) that interconnectrelatively highspeed; connectionless local area networks (eg 10 Mbps). In particular; we areconcerned with the problem of providing differential quality of service to interLAN remoteterminal and file transfer sessions; and throughput fairness between interLAN file transfersessions. We use analytical and simulation models to study a variety of strategies. Our workalso serves to address the performance comparison of connectionless vs. connection-oriented interconnection of CLNS LANS.

Mean end-to-end packet delays in hybrid integrated services networks,TVJ Ganesh Babu; A Kumar,Abstract We study a scheme for approximate calculation of mean end-to-end packet delay ina network that integrates circuit switched and packet switched traffic; using the movableboundary traffic integration scheme on each link. Numerical results obtained from theapproximation are compared with simulation results. We analyse the discrepancies betweenthe simulation and the approximation. The analysis reveals an important phenomenon thatoccurs when packets and circuits are integrated in a network. When a link is shared betweencircuit switched and packet switched traffic; using the movable boundary scheme; then thepacket departure process is burstier than Poisson. In a network of such links; at light circuitswitched loads; the active calls occupy multiple hops; hence bursts of packets departingfrom a link are likely to find the next link available.

Optimal scheduling of a processor executing a communication protocol stack,Srikrishna Kurapati; Anurag Kumar,We consider the problem of optimally scheduling a processor executing a multilayer protocolin an intelligent Network Interface Controller (NIC). In particular; we assume a typical LANenvironment with class 4 transport service; a connectionless network service; and a class 1link level protocol. We develop a queuing model for the problem. In the most general casethis becomes a cyclic queuing network in which some queues have dedicated servers; andthe others have a common schedulable server. We use sample path arguments and Markovdecision theory to determine optimal service schedules. The optimal throughputs arecompared with those obtained with simple policies. The optimal policy yields upto 25%improvement in some cases. In some other cases; the optimal policy does only slightly betterthan much simpler policies.,IFIP Transactions.

Unified approach to nonlinear pulse propagation in optical fibers and self-focusing,Ajit Kumar,Nonlinear pulse propagation in optical fibers and stationary self-focusing of laser beams innonlinear media are investigated using the invariant of motion method. It is shown that thismethod is not only effective for the solution of problems related to nonlinear propagation inquasi-optics but also algebraically simple and yields results faster. In the first case it enablesone to follow the dynamical interplay between dispersion and nonlinearity in detaiLtheknowledge of which is essential for applications to soliton based communication system. Inthe second case; unlike paraxial ray theory; it takes into account the spatial characteristics ofthe whole beam and shows that the real critical power for self-focusing should be at leastfour times the critical power given by paraxial ray theory.,Emerging Optoelectronic Technologies,1992,*

LANDUSE AND NUTRITION LEVEL IN HASPURA ANCHAL; BIHAR,A Kumar; GP Sharma,THE POTENTIALITY of arable land is revealed through the production of food crops andtheir caloric output. Haspura Anchal of Aurangabad district; located in the Southern GangeticPlain of Bihar; provides a distinct agricultural unit to measure the agricultural efficiency of theregion. The study is relevant in the context as the entire region still preserves the traditionaldependence over food-crop economy with little potential to absorb more population. As theextension of arable land is limited; the only way to meet the increasing burden of populationand reduce nutritional deficiency seems to be the improvement of existing landuse; croppingpattern and per-hectare yield.

Queen mating problem in Apis mellifera L. in north west Himalayas.,OP Sharma; D Raj; M Singh; A Kumar,Abstract: Of the 25 queens studied after emergence (end of May 1988); 21 started egglaying; and of these only 12 laid fertilized eggs. Mating success was thus 48%. Average timefrom emergence to start of egg laying was 9.2 days. During this period; max. dailytemperatures were 37.7-43.3 C; and the poor mating success is attributed to these hightemperatures; which apparently caused queens to lay eggs prematurely. Eleven queens thatemerged later (13-23 June) had 100% mating success; and the average time fromemergence to egg laying was 10.8 days; during which max. temperatures were 30.0-37.7.,Indian Bee Journal,1990,*

Drought stress at any growth stagereduced seasonal evapotranspiration; withholding irrigation from heading to maturity gavethe greatest reduction. Weekly irrigation produced large leaf area and maintained green leafthroughout anthesis. Drought stress from emergence to heading decreased LAI bydecreasing the rate of leaf expansion; number of leaves/stem and number of stems/unitarea. Drought stress from heading to maturity decreased LAI due to rapid wilting of leavesand decrease in number of stems/unit area.,Proceedings of the international agricultural engineering conference and exhibition; Bangkok; Thailand; 3-6 Dec. 1990.

Effect of hCG on protein synthesis and progesterone production in the bovine luteal cells,A Kumar; M Das; SK Marchanda; KK Gauri,Summary The study was carried out to investigate whether the luteal steroidogenesis inresponse to tropic stimulus is mediated through de novo synthesis of protein (s). Luteal cellsuspension was prepared by collagenase-DNAse treatment of the bovine corpora lutea;weighing 4—6 g. Cells equivalent to 250 μg of protein were incubated in a total volume of550 μl of medium 199 with or without various test substances. Production of progesterone bythe luteal cells was stimulated by hCG in a dose dependent manner. Incorporation of 3 H-leucine into the cellular proteins was concomitantly enhanced. Emetine; cycloheximide andpuromycin inhibited both basal and hCG stimulated protein synthesis as well asprogesterone production in the cells. Thus; luteal steroidogenesis induced by hCG seems tobe dependent upon de novo synthesis of a protein (s).,Experimental and Clinical Endocrinology & Diabetes,1987,*
Study of Blocking Properties of Three-Stage Clos Networks,HB Kekre; AN Kumar,THREE-STAGE CLOS [I] networks N (111; 11; 2) were studied in [2] where we have derived someof the blocking properties of N (m; 11; 2)with the help of reduced state diagrams. In thispaper; we have attempted to generalize the properties of N (m; 11; 2) to N (111; 11; r) with thehelp of reduced state diagrams. Hence; this paper can be considered as a sequel to [2]. Athree-stage Clos network N (111; 11; r) is shown in Fig I. Here m represents the number of middlestage switches; 11 .is the number of terminals per input/output switch and r is the number of switchesat input/output.

The Systems/Ground Control Interface and Jts Impact on Mining Method Selection,A Kumar; C Haycocks; A Unal,SUMMARY Selection of mining method and optimizing productivity for mines at depthpresents special problems. In room and pillar mining increased pillar size may be counteredby increasing room width to maintain or improve the percentage of underground coalextracted. However; these actions can cause ground control problems which frequentlyresult in serious interruptions in production. Mining costs resulting from such ground controlpractices increase with the higher extraction ratios. For design purposes the cost of lossesdue to high risk ground control must be weighed against the cost of minimizing theseproblems and improving ground conditions or selecting another method such as longwall orshortwall. The economic impact of ground control for room and pillar mining system andcaving methods including a variety of conditions such as depth; mining height; rock …,*,1987,*

A FIELD STUDY FOR EVALUATION OF FLEXIBLE PAVEMENTS USING WAVE-PROPAGATION TECHNIQUE,AK Gupta; Satish Chandra; Ashok Kumar,Modulus of elasticity is the fundamental property which is required for a rational design andevaluation of various pavements. Presently modulus of elasticity is calculated by destructivemethod. A non-destructive method to evaluate the modulus of elasticity would be very usefulfor developing countries like India where the problem of overloading and inadequatemaintenance is causing a great threat to the designers. In India; very limited work has beendone in this direction and most of the work reported in different journals is of abroad. In thepresent study an attempt has been made to evaluate the in-situ pavements using theequipment acquired by transportation engineering section of University of Roorkee from alocal agency.

Ground control ramifications and economic impact of retreat mining on room and pillar coal mines,Arun Kumar,As the coal reserves at shallow depths become exhausted companies have to developdeeper deposits and increase percentage extraction to maintain production levels. Totalextraction for room and pillar mines can only be achieved by pillar extraction. Theunsupported roof increases during pillar extraction and hence the cost of ground control alsoincreases. Nevertheless; pillar extraction where possible has many potential advantagessuch as decreased operating cost; increased utilization of reserves; and extended life of themine. There are several variables such as depth; mining height; rock strength; mininggeometry; roof and floor conditions; and retreat mining methods; which affect pillar extractioncost. Cost components of pillar extraction are classified as direct; indirect; fixed; andsubsidence compensation costs. A discounted cash flow pillar extraction cost simulator …,*,1986,*

Socio-biological parameters in relation to permanent sterilisation of parents,KL Gupta; SK Tamer; A Kumar; M Chansoria; KK Bansil; KK Kaul,Abstract A random sample of 400 families (200 urban and 200 rural) where either parenthad undergone permanent sterilisation (vasectomy or tubectomy) were studied. Malesterilisations were higher than female sterilisations. Economic status of families studied didnot show any significant relation to type of operation preferred. Maternal literacy was directlyrelated to the preponderance of tubectomies in urban areas. The latter were also found to besignificantly higher in the Jain community where joint families were the rule. Majority of themothers got married and conceived before 20 years of age. Average duration of activereproductive life prior to sterilisation was 18· 6 years (rural) and 11· 5 years (urban).

Although some reports onophthalmological problems following OKT3 administration have been published recently; webelieve that the presented data do not allow this conclusion [1; 2]. The authors fail to excludeacute cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection which is well known to cause chorioretinitis withperivascular infiltrates; exudates; and haemorrhage; and a permanent reduction in visualacuity [3; 4].

Water metering in Hobart-An appraisal of the cost-benefit study,Aje Kumar,Hobart is the only capital city in Australia where water is supplied to the consumersunmetered. A flat rate is charged annually in return for which consumers may take virtuallyunlimited water. There seems to be a prevalent belief that water should not be sold to thecommunity of Hobart on the basis of consumption because of the natural abundance ofwater in Tasmania. This view is reflected in the'requirements approach'used by theMetropolitan Water Board in planning supply expansions. What is little realised is that thesource of Hobart's water (although virtually inexhaustible) is situated a fairly great distanceaway from the metropolitan area. Transporting water through pipelines over long distancesis not a cost-less affair and by virtue of this fact; water must be looked upon and treated asan economic good. This study has a three-fold objective. Firstly; it is to examine the …,*,1978,*

Equations of motion-calculation of spectra excited via single particle theorem,Ashwini Kumar; RK Bansal,The double commutator equations of motion have been used to calculate the energyspectrum of residual nucleus excited by the addition of one nucleon to the target. Thecalculation assumes that this addition does not disturb the target configuration (weakcoupling). However; the added nucleon is free to occupy any of the vacant orbits. Majoradvantage of this method is that it gives relevant spectra without getting into the complexitiesof a standard shell model calculation. It is analogous to the sum rule method of calculatingcentroids of energy spectra. The equations of motion relate the energy matrix for excitedstates to the target multipole moments. In the simple case; where the target is a singleparticle nucleus; the multipole moments are very easily obtained analytically. For complextarget states; these can be obtained with the help of non-energy weighted sum rules. The …,*,1976,*

EFFICIENT DESIGN OF STATIC ANALYSIS TOOL FOR DETECTING WEB VULNERABILITIES,ANL KUMAR; PLN RAJU; SANGAPU VENKATA APPAJI; D RATNA GIRI,Abstract: The number and the importance of web applications have increased rapidly overthe last years. At the same time; the quantity and impact of security vulnerabilities in suchapplications have grown as well. Since manual code reviews are time-consuming; errorprone and costly; the need for automated solutions has become evident. Many webapplications written in ASP suffer from injection vulnerabilities; and static analysis makes itpossible to track down these vulnerabilities before they are exposed on the web. In thispaper; we address the problem of vulnerable web applications by means of static sourcecode analysis. To this end; we propose a new technique to detect XSS attacks and SQLinjection vulnerabilities based on taint analysis; It tracks various kinds of external input; tagstaint types; constructing control flow graph is constructed based on the use of data flow …,*,*,*

ABSORPTION OF ZIRAM FUNGICIDES IN SOILS,Dim-sh Mani; Chitranjan Kumar; Ritesh Kumar; Arvind Kumar; Shri Krishan Upadhyay,ABSTRACT: The Freundlich equation provided a good fit (r2> 0.99) for the adsorption dataon ziram in all the soils. Freundlich constant (K) values for ziram in t... the soils ranged from0.7510 to 1.772. The values for l/n (energy of adsorption) were less than unity (I/n< 1) forziram and indicated non-linear relationship between the ziram concentration and adsorptionand therefore can be characterized as L-type of adsorption. The sorption coefficient of ziramfor organic carbon (Koc) ranged from 64.91 to 91.30 pg/g. The Gibb's free energy (AG) werealways negative indicating that the adsorption was exothermic. The results also suggest thatthe adsorption process is inﬂuenced by association mechanism between organic andinorganic constituent of soils; and adsorption was in the order; black> sandy loam> alluvialsoils.,*,*,*

Possible Biomimicking for the Design of Micro Aerial Vehicle’s Considering Species Specific Features of Insect; Bird; and Bat Flight,N Chari; AG Sarwade; C Mohan Srikanth; Amit Kumar,Abstract: We can learn many things by observing the biological flight of insects; birds andbats since they fly with higher aerodynamic efficiency ie; their lift to drag ratio is much higheras compared to our airplanes. They produce thrust by a complex morpho-functional flappingphenomenon. The comparison of flight features of these three types of fliers gives us someuseful clues on the nature of natural wing materials having special properties (like lightweight and high flexibility) which have to be considered seriously for their usage in Microaerial vehicle's to enhance their aerodynamic efficiency. The evolutionary history of thesefliers and flapping is a notable feature. Insects are miniature fliers having low mass; resilin;and membranous chitinous wings; with high flapping frequency of 500 Hz or more. Toimitate them is difficult.

Combination antimicrobial therapy is unwarranted for Gram negative sepsis,Narinder Pal Singh; Anish Kumar,Among various infections underlying sepsis; bacteremia is recognized as a critical conditionthat influences the outcome of sepsis and associated with an attributable mortality ofapproximately 35%[1] especially among persons age 65 years and older. Septic shockoccurs in 25% to 40% of patients with gram-negative bacteremia. Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative organisms have emerged as a major threat to hospitalized patients and have beenassociated with mortality rates ranging from 30 to 70%[2]. Traditionally; combinationantibiotic therapy for infections with Gram-negative bacteria has included two agents;typically a beta-lactam and an aminoglycoside. Whether combination antimicrobial therapyis more efficacious than monotherapy for infections with Gram-negative bacteria remainscontroversial; particularly for infections due to organisms more commonly acquired in …,*,*,*

Effect of Linear Interaction and Generation of Sideband in the Magnetosphere,Anil Kumar,Abstract: Common view is that non-linear interaction between whistler mode signals from aVLF transmitter and energetic electrons can successfully explain the generation of sidebandspacings of 1-30 kHz in the magnetosphere. However; VLF transmitter experimentsconducted at Siple show that long keydown signals injected into the magnetosphere oftengenerate sidebands as a result of nonlinear interaction with energetic particles. The spectralcharacteristics of observed sidebands are quite varied from~ 2 to 100 Hz; but it bears nosimple relationship to the carrier amplitudes. It is shown that such small spacing need wavemagnetic field amplitude of 1.5 pT; which is lower than threshold for non-liner amplification.The results indicate that linear amplification is able to explain such sideband spacings.,*,*,*

However; the field of TMDs and othercauses of orofacial pain is undergoing a radical change; primarily because of an explosionof knowledge about pain management in general. As a result; etiological theories aboutTMDs are evolving toward a biopsychosocial medical model from the traditional dentalframework. Conservative and reversible management approaches (especially of chronicpain conditions) are becoming the norm rather than the exception in treating TMD patients;and already certain biological and psychosocial factors are known to affect the outcomes.Current research in this field is focused on genetic and environmental susceptibility factorsas well as individual adaptive potentials.

Study of Routing Protocols for Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks,Jagtar Singh; Sanjay Singla; Surender Jagra; Amit Kumar,Abstract-A Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) is a collection of wireless mobile nodes forminga temporary network without using any centralized access point; infrastructure; or centralizedadministration. To establish a data transmission between two nodes; typically multiple hopsare required due to the limited transmission range. Every node in MANET work as router.Mobility of the different nodes makes the situation even more complicated due topologychange. Multiple routing protocols especially for these conditions have been developedduring the last years; to find optimized routes from a source to some destination. Routingprotocols in MANET are classified in to proactive (table driven); reactive (ondemand) andhybrid protocols. The nodes in MANET have low processing capabilities and these areconnected by low bandwidth wireless links. To cope with low processing capabilities of …,*,*,*

IS LINEAR GYRO-RESONANT INTERACTION RESPONSIBLE FOR 2HZ. SIDE BANDS?,Anil Kumar; DP Singh; Ashwani Kumar,ABSTRACT Wave-particle interaction plays an important role in the morphology ofionosphere and magnetosphere and wave propagation. Common view is that Nonlinearcyclotron interaction between resonant electrons; in resonance with transmitted signals inthe magnetosphere in 1-30 kHz range is a reason to cause side bands. Side band spacingof 20 Hz (and above) can easily be explained through nonlinear amplification process.Wave magnetic amplitude of 3-5 pT for wave-particle interaction to occur in themagnetosphere the need for non-linear interaction as per the established theory of Inan(1977). It is shown that wave magnetic amplitude (Bw) only of~ 2pTisneeded to cause small-such as 2-3 Hz side band spacing; which is below 3 pT suggesting that linear gyro-resonantinteraction may also be a cause of small side bands.,*,*,*

The name means “carryingbody”; and is derived from the Latin word'transferre'; meaning „to carry across‟; and theGreek word „soma‟; for a „body‟. A Transfersome carrier is an artificial vesicle designed tobe like acell vesicle or a cell engaged in exocytosis; and thus suitable for controlled and;potentially targeted; drug delivery. The term Transfersome and the underlying concept wereintroduced in 1991 by Gregor Cevc. Numerous groups have since been working with similarcarriers; frequently under different names (elastic vesicle; flexible vesicle; Ethosome; etc.) todescribe them. In a broader sense; a Transfersome is a highly adaptable and stress-responsive; complex aggregate. Its preferred form is an ultradeformable vesicle …,*,*,*

High Performance Error Detection and Correction Technique for Memories Using Difference-Set Codes,Teena Ann Thomas; Ashad Kumar,ABSTRACT As technology scales; Single Event Upsets (SEU) become more common andaffect a large number of memory cells. In order to protect memories against SEUs is to makeuse advanced error detecting and correcting codes are used. An error detection method fordifference–set cyclic codes with majority logic is presented in this paper. Majority logicdecodable codes have the capability to correct a large number of errors so these codes areused in memory applications. But they require a large decoding time which affects thememory performance. The proposed fault detection technique resolves this problem. Itreduces the memory access time when there is no error in the data read. In this techniquethe Majority Logic Decoder (MLD) itself used to detect failures; thus area become minimaland keeps the extra power consumption low.,Int.

Analyzing Effect of System Inertia on Grid Frequency Forecasting Usnig Two Stage Neuro-Fuzzy System,Divyansh R Chourey; Himanshu Gupta; Amit Kumar; Jitesh Kumar; Anand Kumar; Anup Mishra,Abstract Frequency forecasting is an important aspect of power system operation. Thesystem frequency varies with load-generation imbalance. Frequency variation dependsupon various parameters including system inertia. System inertia determines the rate of fallof frequency after the disturbance in the grid. Though; inertia of the system is not consideredwhile forecasting the frequency of power system during planning and operation. This leadsto significant errors in forecasting. In this paper; the effect of inertia on frequency forecastingis analysed for a particular grid system. In this paper; a parameter equivalent to systeminertia is introduced. This parameter is used to forecast the frequency of a typical power gridfor any instant of time. The system gives appreciable result with reduced error.,Journal of The Institution of Engineers (India): Series B,*,*
Dictionary Learning Based Applications in Image Processing using Convex Optimisation,Abhay Kumar; Saurabh Kataria,Abstract—In this term paper; sparse based representation of images has been exploited forvarious applications. Sparse and redundant representation is based on the assumptions thatthe signals can be described as a linear combination of a few atoms from the pre-defineddictionary. Dictionary atoms is either selected using k-SVD algorithm or taken as standardDCT atoms. Dictionary atoms can lso be set by randomly sampling patches from the image.Different applications of sparse based representation have been presented. ImageInpainting; classification and Image denoising applications based on sparse representationare presented.

Diversity in P-loop Structure of A-ATP Synthase,A Kumar; MSS Manimekalai; AM Balakrishna; G Grüber,ATP synthase and ATPase are the key components in energy utilization in cells. They areessentially the turbines in powerhouse to create energy in the form of ATP or use ATP asenergy to drive cellular activities. P-loop is a common motif in ATP and GTP bindingproteins; including ATP synthase and ATPase; and its conformation change is critical inA/GTP utilization. Prof. Grüber's group solves several structures of A-ATP synthases. Itcontributes to our knowledge of P-loop. Differences as small as 3 amino acids in the P-loopsequence change its conformation and have a profound impact on its effectiveness.

Minimization of Leakage Current of 6T SRAM using Optimal Technology,Sumit Kumar Srivastava; Amit Kumar,Abstract: Leakage components are very important for estimation and reduction of leakagecurrent; especially for low power applications. This provides the motivation to explore thedesign of low leakage SRAM cells. High leakage currents in deep submicron regimes arebecoming a major contributor to total power dissipation of CMOS circuits as the thresholdvoltage; channel length and gate oxide thickness are scaled. Memory leakage suppressionis critically important for the success of power-efficient designs; especially for ultra-lowpower applications. As the channel length of the MOSFET reduces; the leakage current inthe SRAM increases. One method is to reduce the standby supply voltage (VDD) to its limit;which is the Data retention voltage (DRV); leakage power can be substantially reduced.Also; lower operating voltage will lower the stability of SRAM cell. Two schemes are …,*,*,*

ﬁt Bibi SYNTHESEZENG ﬁA’E ‘Al PART USENG FPGAS,AR Naseer M Balakrishnan Anshul Kumar,Currently a number of technology options are available ranging from Full-custom;semicustom to the Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAS). FPGAs are rapidly gainingpopularity due to the short design cycle time and low manufacturing cost. Many of the FPGAmapping techniques are based on the adaptation of semi-custom/Gate Array approach.However; FPGAs provide building blocks (typically called logic blocks) which are morecomplex as compared to those of Semi-customs and Gate Arrays. Therefore; the existingtechnology mapping approaches [1; 2] do not exploit the full potential of FPGAS. This isespecially true for realizing datapart of the design as the technology mapping step is unableto make use of the natural iterative structure of the design present at RT-level.
