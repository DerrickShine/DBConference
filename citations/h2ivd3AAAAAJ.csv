Slim-trees: High performance metric trees minimizing overlap between nodes,Caetano Traina Jr; Agma Traina; Bernhard Seeger; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract In this paper we present the Slim-tree; a dynamic tree for organizing metric datasetsin pages of fixed size. The Slim-tree uses the “fat-factor” which provides a simple way toquantify the degree of overlap between the nodes in a metric tree. It is well-known that thedegree of overlap directly affects the query performance of index structures. There are manysuggestions to reduce overlap in multidimensional index structures; but the Slim-tree is thefirst metric structure explicitly designed to reduce the degree of overlap. Moreover; wepresent new algorithms for inserting objects and splitting nodes. The new insertion algorithmleads to a tree with high storage utilization and improved query performance; whereas thenew split algorithm runs considerably faster than previous ones; generally without sacrificingsearch performance. Results obtained from experiments with real-world data sets show …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2000,339
Fast indexing and visualization of metric data sets using slim-trees,Caetano Traina Jr; Agma Traina; Christos Faloutsos; Bernhard Seeger,Many recent database applications need to deal with similarity queries. For suchapplications; it is important to measure the similarity between two objects using the distancebetween them. Focusing on this problem; this paper proposes the slim-tree; a new dynamictree for organizing metric data sets in pages of fixed size. The slim-tree uses the triangleinequality to prune the distance calculations that are needed to answer similarity queriesover objects in metric spaces. The proposed insertion algorithm uses new policies to selectthe nodes where incoming objects are stored. When a node overflows; the slim-tree uses aminimal spanning tree to help with the splitting. The new insertion algorithm leads to a treewith high storage utilization and improved query performance. The slim-tree is a metricaccess method that tackles the problem of overlaps between nodes in metric spaces and …,Knowledge and Data Engineering; IEEE Transactions on,2002,230
Fast feature selection using fractal dimension,Caetano Traina; Agma Traina; Leejay Wu; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract Dimensionality curse and dimensionality reduction are two issues that haveretained high interest for data mining; machine learning; multimedia indexing; andclustering. We present a fast; scalable algorithm to quickly select the most importantattributes (dimensions) for a given set of n-dimensional vectors. In contrast to older methods;our method has the following desirable properties:(a) it does not do rotation of attributes;thus leading to easy interpretation of the resulting attributes;(b) it can spot attributes thathave nonlinear correlations;(c) it requires a constant number of passes over the dataset;(d) itgives a good estimate on how many attributes we should keep. The idea is to use the'fractal'dimension of a dataset as a good approximation of its intrinsic dimension; and to dropattributes that do not affect it. We applied our method on real and synthetic datasets …,*,2000,203
Clustering very large multi-dimensional datasets with mapreduce,Robson Leonardo Ferreira Cordeiro; Caetano Traina Junior; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Julio López; U Kang; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract Given a very large moderate-to-high dimensionality dataset; how could one clusterits points? For datasets that don't fit even on a single disk; parallelism is a first class option.In this paper we explore MapReduce for clustering this kind of data. The main questions are(a) how to minimize the I/O cost; taking into account the already existing data partition (eg;on disks); and (b) how to minimize the network cost among processing nodes. Either of themmay be a bottleneck. Thus; we propose the Best of both Worlds--BoW method; thatautomatically spots the bottleneck and chooses a good strategy. Our main contributionsare:(1) We propose BoW and carefully derive its cost functions; which dynamically choosethe best strategy;(2) We show that BoW has numerous desirable features: it can work withmost serial clustering methods as a plugged-in clustering subroutine; it balances the cost …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2011,164

On query result diversification,Marcos R Vieira; Humberto L Razente; Maria CN Barioni; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Divesh Srivastava; Caetano Traina; Vassilis J Tsotras,In this paper we describe a general framework for evaluation and optimization of methodsfor diversifying query results. In these methods; an initial ranking candidate set produced bya query is used to construct a result set; where elements are ranked with respect torelevance and diversity features; ie; the retrieved elements should be as relevant aspossible to the query; and; at the same time; the result set should be as diverse as possible.While addressing relevance is relatively simple and has been heavily studied; diversity is aharder problem to solve. One major contribution of this paper is that; using the aboveframework; we adapt; implement and evaluate several existing methods for diversifyingquery results. We also propose two new approaches; namely the Greedy with MarginalContribution (GMC) and the Greedy Randomized with Neighborhood Expansion (GNE) …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,113
Retrieval by content of medical images using texture for tissue identification,Joaquim Cezar Felipe; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,This work aims at supporting the retrieval and indexing of medical images by extracting andorganizing intrinsic features of them; more specifically texture attributes from images. A toolfor obtaining the relevant textures was implemented This tool retrieves and classifies imagesusing the extracted values; and allows the user to issue similarity queries. The application ofthe proposed method on images has given encouraging results that motivate to apply themethod as a basis to more experiments; at diversified contexts. The accuracy degreeobtained from the precision and recall plots was always over 90% for queries asking forsimilar images for up to 20% of the database.,Computer-Based Medical Systems; 2003.

Spatial join selectivity using power laws,Christos Faloutsos; Bernhard Seeger; Agma Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract We discovered a surprising law governing the spatial join selectivity across two setsof points. An example of such a spatial join is “find the libraries that are within 10 miles ofschools”. Our law dictates that the number of such qualifying pairs follows a power law;whose exponent we call “pair-count exponent”(PC). We show that this law also holds for self-spatial-joins (“find schools within 5 miles of other schools”) in addition to the general casethat the two point-sets are distinct. Our law holds for many real datasets; including diverseenvironments (geographic datasets; feature vectors from biology data; galaxy data fromastronomy). In addition; we introduce the concept of the Box-Occupancy-Product-Sum(BOPS) plot; and we show that it can compute the pair-count exponent in a timely manner;reducing the run time by orders of magnitude; from quadratic to linear.

An association rule-based method to support medical image diagnosis with efficiency,Marcela X Ribeiro; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina; Paulo M Azevedo-Marques,In this paper; we propose a method based on association rule-mining to enhance thediagnosis of medical images (mammograms). It combines low-level features automaticallyextracted from images and high-level knowledge from specialists to search for patterns. Ourmethod analyzes medical images and automatically generates suggestions of diagnosesemploying mining of association rules. The suggestions of diagnosis are used to acceleratethe image analysis performed by specialists as well as to provide them an alternative to workon. The proposed method uses two new algorithms; PreSAGe and HiCARe. The PreSAGealgorithm combines; in a single step; feature selection and discretization; and reduces themining complexity.

A fast and effective method to find correlations among attributes in databases,Elaine PM de Sousa; Caetano Traina Jr; Agma JM Traina; Leejay Wu; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract The problem of identifying meaningful patterns in a database lies at the very heartof data mining. A core objective of data mining processes is the recognition of inter-attributecorrelations. Not only are correlations necessary for predictions and classifications–sincerules would fail in the absence of pattern–but also the identification of groups of mutuallycorrelated attributes expedites the selection of a representative subset of attributes; fromwhich existing mappings allow others to be derived. In this paper; we describe a scalable;effective algorithm to identify groups of correlated attributes. This algorithm can handle non-linear correlations between attributes; and is not restricted to a specific family of mappingfunctions; such as the set of polynomials. We show the results of our evaluation of thealgorithm applied to synthetic and real world datasets; and demonstrate that it is able to …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2007,52

Traina; C Traina; JM Bueno; FJT Chino; P Azevedo-Marques,Abstract This paper presents a new and efficient method for content-based image retrievalemploying the color distribution of images. This new method; called metric histogram; takesadvantage of the correlation among adjacent bins of histograms; reducing thedimensionality of the feature vectors extracted from images; leading to faster and moreflexible indexing and retrieval processes. The proposed technique works on each imageindependently from the others in the dataset; therefore there is no pre-defined number ofcolor regions in the resulting histogram. Thus; it is not possible to use traditional comparisonalgorithms such as Euclidean or Manhattan distances. To allow the comparison of imagesthrough the new feature vectors given by metric histograms; a new metric distance functionMHD () is also proposed.

Mining statistical association rules to select the most relevant medical image features,Marcela Ribeiro; Andre Balan; Joaquim Felipe; Agma Traina; Caetano Traina,Abstract In this chapter we discuss how to take advantage of association rule mining topromote feature selection from low-level image features. Feature selection can significantlyimprove the precision of content-based queries in image databases by removing noisy andredundant features. A new algorithm named StARMiner is presented. StARMiner aims atfinding association rules relating low-level image features to high-level knowledge about theimages. Such rules are employed to select the most relevant features. We present a casestudy in order to highlight how the proposed algorithm performs in different situations;regarding its ability to select the most relevant features that properly distinguish the images.We compare the StARMiner algorithm with other well-known feature selection algorithms;showing that StARMiner reaches higher precision rates.

We show that the use of the fractals can boost therepresentation level of traditional image features allowing high rates of precision whenanswering similarity queries over images employing a variance weighted Manhattandistance.

How to improve the pruning ability of dynamic metric access methods,Caetano Traina Jr; Agma Traina; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract Complex data retrieval is accelerated using index structures; which organize thedata in order to prune comparisons between data during queries. In metric spaces;comparison operations can be specially expensive; so the pruning ability of indexingmethods turns out to be specially meaningful. This paper shows how to measure the pruningpower of metric access methods; and defines a new measurement; called" prunability;"which indicates how well a pruning technique carries out the task of cutting down distancecalculations at each tree level. It also presents a new dynamic access method; aiming tominimize the number of distance calculations required to answer similarity queries. We showthat this novel structure is up to 3 times faster and requires less than 25% distancecalculations to answer similarity queries; as compared to existing methods. This gain in …,Proceedings of the eleventh international conference on Information and knowledge management,2002,41
Assessing the best integration between distance-function and image-feature to answer similarity queries,Pedro H Bugatti; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract The retrieval of multimedia data relies on a feature extractor to provide the intrinsiccharacteristics (features) from the data; and a measure to quantify the similarity betweenthem. A challenge in multimedia database systems is how to best integrate these two keyaspects in order to improve the quality of the retrieved selection when answering similarityqueries. In this paper; we analyze and compare a set of distance functions and featureextractors with regard to the association and dependencies among them. The results showthat the most widely used and well-known distance functions; such as the Euclideandistance; do not reach a desirable similarity assessment; and reveal that a careful choice ofa distance function considerably improves the retrieval of multimedia data; which in ourexperiments reached up to 92%.,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2008,40

What is thesmallest/largest pair-wise distance across the two datasets? Which of the two clouds does anew point (feature vector) come from? We propose a new tool; the tri-plot; and itsgeneralization; the pq-plot; which help us answer the above questions.

Thus; the user satisfaction with the system is increased as our experimentsdemonstrated. Besides being effective; the new RF techniques are very fast as they take lessthan one second to reprocess the queries at each iteration. The experiments also show thatwith three iterations the users are satisfied with the query results; and the major gain inprecision happens in the first iteration; achieving improvements of up to 30%; what lessensthe user efforts and anxiety,Computer-Based Medical Systems; 2006.

In order to reduce the informationto the meaningful data; techniques such as attribute selection have been used. In this paperwe present a fast; scalable algorithm to quickly select the most important attributes(dimensions) for a given set of n-dimensional vectors; determining what attributes arecorrelated to the others and how to group them. The algorithm takes advantage of the'fractal'dimension of a data set as a good approximation of its intrinsic dimension and; basedon it; indicates what attributes are the most important to keep the meaning of the data.

Measuring evolving data streams’ behavior through their intrinsic dimension,Elaine PM de Sousa; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract The dimension of a dataset has major impact on database management; such asindexing and querying processing. The embedding dimension (ie; the number of attributesof the dataset) usually overestimates the actual contribution of the attributes to the maincharacteristics of the data; as the typical assumption of uniform distribution andindependence between attributes usually does not hold. In fact; due to dependencies andattribute correlations; real data are typically skewed and exhibit intrinsic dimensionalitymuch lower than the embedding dimension. Similarly; the intrinsic dimension can also beapplied to improve data stream processing and analysis. Data streams are generated assequences of events represented by a predetermined number of numerical attributes. Thus;without loss of generality; we can consider events as elements from a dimensional …,New Generation Computing,2006,23

A growing number of applications require indices that must be builtfaster and repeatedly; also providing faster response for similarity queries. The increase inthe main memory capacity and its lowering costs also motivate using memory-based MAMs.In this paper; we propose the Onion-tree; a new and robust dynamic memory-based MAMthat slices the metric space into disjoint subspaces to provide quick indexing of complexdata.

We have tested classical algorithms for automaticsegmentation of this kind of image; but usually they are not precise enough to generateaccurate contours to allow lesion classification based on shape analyses. Thus; in this work;we have used Zernike moments for invariant pattern recognition within regions of interest(ROIs); without previous segmentation of images.

Accelerating< i> k-medoid</i>-based algorithms through metric access methods,Maria Camila N Barioni; Humberto L Razente; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,Abstract Scalable data mining algorithms have become crucial to efficiently support KDDprocesses on large databases. In this paper; we address the task of scaling up k-medoid-based algorithms through the utilization of metric access methods; allowing clusteringalgorithms to be executed by database management systems in a fraction of the time usuallyrequired by the traditional approaches. We also present an optimization strategy that can beapplied as an additional step of the proposed algorithm in order to achieve better clusteringsolutions.

Mamcost: Global and local estimates leading to robust cost estimation of similarity queries,Gisele Busichia Baioco; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,This paper presents an effective cost model to estimate the number of disk accesses (I/Ocost) and the number of distance calculations (CPU cost) to process similarity queries overdata indexed by metric access methods. Two types of similarity queries were taken intoconsideration: range and k-nearest neighbor queries. The main point of the cost model isconsidering not only global parameters of the data set but also the local data distribution.The model takes advantage of the intrinsic dimension of the data set; estimated by itscorrelation fractal dimension. Experiments were performed on real and synthetic data sets;with different sizes and dimensions; in order to validate the proposed model. They confirmedthat the estimations are accurate; within the range achieved by real queries.,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2007. SSBDM'07. 19th International Conference on,2007,21
SuperGraph visualization,Jose F Rodrigues Jr; Agma JM Traina; Christos Faloutsos; Caetano Traina Jr,Given a large social or computer network; how can we visualize it; find patterns; outliers;communities? Although several graph visualization tools exist; they cannot handle largegraphs with hundred thousand nodes and possibly million edges. Such graphs bring twochallenges: interactive visualization demands prohibitive processing power and; even if wecould interactively update the visualization; the user would be overwhelmed by theexcessive number of graphical items. To cope with this problem; we propose a formalinnovation on the use of graph hierarchies that leads to GMine system. GMine promotesscalability using a hierarchy of graph partitions; promotes concomitant presentation for thegraph hierarchy and for the original graph; and extends analytical possibilities with theintegration of the graph partitions in an interactive environment,Multimedia; 2006.

Large graph analysis in the gmine system,Jose F Rodrigues; Hanghang Tong; Jia-Yu Pan; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina; Christos Faloutsos,Current applications have produced graphs on the order of hundreds of thousands of nodesand millions of edges. To take advantage of such graphs; one must be able to find patterns;outliers; and communities. These tasks are better performed in an interactive environment;where human expertise can guide the process. For large graphs; though; there are somechallenges: the excessive processing requirements are prohibitive; and drawing hundred-thousand nodes results in cluttered images hard to comprehend. To cope with theseproblems; we propose an innovative framework suited for any kind of tree-like graph visualdesign. GMine integrates 1) a representation for graphs organized as hierarchies ofpartitions-the concepts of SuperGraph and Graph-Tree; and 2) a graph summarizationmethodology-CEPS.

Using Pivots to Speed-Up k-Medoids Clustering,Adriano Arantes Paterlini; Mario A Nascimento; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract Clustering is a key technique within the KDD process; with k-means; and the moregeneral k-medoids; being well-known incremental partition-based clustering algorithms. Afundamental issue within this class of algorithms is to find an initial set of medians (ormedoids) that improves the efficiency of the algorithms (eg; accelerating its convergence to asolution); at the same time that it improves its effectiveness (eg; finding more meaningfulclusters). Thus; in this article we aim at providing a technique that; given a set of elements;quickly finds a very small number of elements as medoid candidates for this set; allowing toimprove both the efficiency and effectiveness of existing clustering algorithms. We target theclass of k-medoids algorithms in general; and propose a technique that selects a well-positioned subset of central elements to serve as the initial set of medoids for the …,Journal of Information and Data Management,2011,20

How to improve medical image diagnosis through association rules: The IDEA method,Marcela Xavier Ribeiro; A Traina; C Traina; Natalia Abdala Rosa; P Marques,In this paper we present a new method; called IDEA; which employs association rules toassist in medical image diagnosis. IDEA mines association rules; relating visual featureswith the knowledge gotten from specialists; and employs the associations to suggestpossible diagnoses for a given medical image. IDEA incorporates two new algorithms calledOmega and ACE. Omega performs simultaneously feature selection and data discretizationvery efficiently with linear cost on the number of feature values. ACE is a new associativeclassifier; which has the particular ability of suggesting multiple keywords to compose thediagnosis for a given medical image. The IDEA method has an important characteristic thatmakes it different from other CAD methods: it suggests multiple diagnosis hypotheses for animage and ranks them based on a measure of quality.

Genetic algorithms for approximate similarity queries,Renato Bueno; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract Algorithms to query large sets of simple data (composed of numbers and smallcharacter strings) are constructed to retrieve the exact answer; retrieving every relevantelement; so the answer said to be exact. Similarity searching over complex data is muchmore expensive than searching over simple data. Moreover; comparison operations overcomplex data usually consider features extracted from each element; instead of theelements themselves. Thus; even if an algorithm retrieves an exact answer; it is'exact'regarding the extracted features; not regarding the original elements themselves.Therefore; trading exact answering with query time response can be worthwhile. In this workwe developed two search strategies based on genetic algorithms to allow retrievingapproximate data indexed by Metric Access Methods (MAM) within a limited; user-defined …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2007,20

Querying complex objects by similarity in SQL.,Maria Camila Nardini Barioni; Humberto Luiz Razente; Caetano Traina Jr; Agma JM Traina,Abstract. Similarity search has received large attention on modern database applicationsinvolving complex objects; since the queries executed in such databases are seldom basedon exact matches but rather on some specific notion of similarity. However; the SQL querylanguage does not provide effective support for similarity queries. This paper proposes theaddition of similarity queries to SQL; including a new set of similarity operators in order tosearch complex objects stored as sets of attributes in a relation. It also describes a prototypedeveloped to validate and illustrate the concepts and syntax presented.,SBBD,2005,20

MedFMI-SiR: A powerful DBMS solution for large-scale medical image retrieval,Daniel S Kaster; Pedro H Bugatti; Marcelo Ponciano-Silva; Agma JM Traina; Paulo MA Marques; Antonio C Santos; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract Medical systems increasingly demand methods to deal with the large amount ofimages that are daily generated. Therefore; the development of fast and scalableapplications to store and retrieve images in large repositories becomes an importantconcern. Moreover; it is necessary to handle textual and content-based queries over suchdata coupled with DICOM image metadata and their visual patterns. While DBMSs havebeen extensively used to manage applications' textual information; content-basedprocessing tasks usually rely on specific solutions. Most of these solutions are targeted torelatively small and controlled datasets; being unfeasible to be employed in real medicalenvironments that deal with voluminous databases.

Low level features of shape and texture areextracted from images. Statistical association rules are used to select the most relevantfeatures to discriminate the images; reducing the size of the feature vectors and eliminatingnoisy features that influence negatively the query results; making the whole process moreefficient. Additionally; our approach uses a new relevance feedback technique to overcomethe semantic gap that exists between low level features and the high level user interpretationof images.

Using relevance feedback to reduce the semantic gap in content-based image retrieval of mammographic masses,Natalia A Rosa; Joaquim C Felipe; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina; Rangaraj M Rangayyan; Paulo M Azevedo-Marques,This paper presents the use of relevance feedback (RFb) to reduce the semantic gap incontent-based image retrieval (CBIR) of mammographic masses. Tests were conductedwhere the radiologists' classification of the lesions based on the BI-RADS categories wereused with techniques of query-point movement to incorporate RFb. The measures ofsimilarity of images used for CBIR were based upon Zernike moments. The performance ofCBIR was measured in terms of precision and recall of retrieval. The results indicateimprovement due to RFb of up to 41.6% in precision. In our experiments; the gain in theperformance of CBIR with RFb was associated with the BI-RADS category of the querymammographic image; with large improvement in cases of lesions belonging to categories 4and 5.

The MM-tree: a memory-based metric tree without overlap between nodes,Ives Rene Venturini Pola; Caetano Traina Jr; Agma Juci Machado Traina,Abstract Advanced database systems offer similarity queries on complex data. Searching bysimilarity on complex data is accelerated through the use of metric access methods (MAM).These access methods organize data in order to reduce the number of comparison betweenelements when answering queries. MAM can be categorized in two types: disk-based andmemory-based. The disk-based structures limit the partitioning of space forcing nodes tohave multiple elements according to disk page sizes. However; memory-based trees allowsmore flexibility; producing trees faster to build and to perform queries. Although recentdevelopments target disk-based methods on tree structures; several applications benefitsfrom a faster way to build indexes on main memory. This paper presents a memory-basedmetric tree; the MM-tree; which successively partitions the space into non-overlapping …,Proceedings of the 11th East European conference on Advances in databases and information systems,2007,18
DBM-tree: trading height-balancing for performance in metric access methods,Marcos R Vieira; Caetano Traina Jr; Fabio JT Chino; Agma JM Traina,Metric Access Methods (MAM) are employed to accelerate the processing of similarityqueries; such as the range and the k-nearest neighbor queries. Current methods; such asthe Slim-tree and the M-tree; improve the query performance minimizing the number of diskaccesses; keeping a constant height of the structures stored on disks (height-balancedtrees). However; the overlapping between their nodes has a very high influence on theirperformance. This paper presents a new dynamic MAM called the DBM-tree (Density-BasedMetric tree); which can minimize the overlap between high-density nodes by relaxing theheight-balancing of the structure. Thus; the height of the tree is larger in denser regions; inorder to keep a tradeoff between breadth-searching and depth-searching. An underpinningfor cost estimation on tree structures is their height; so we show a non-height dependable …,Journal of the Brazilian Computer Society,2006,18
A novel optimization approach to efficiently process aggregate similarity queries in metric access methods,Humberto L Razente; Maria Camila N Barioni; Agma Juci M Traina; Christos Faloutsos; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract A similarity query considers an element as the query center and searches a datasetto find either the elements far up to a bounding radius or the k nearest ones from the querycenter. Several algorithms have been developed to efficiently execute similarity queries.However; there are queries that require more than one center; which we call AggregateSimilarity Queries. Such queries appear when the user gives multiple desirable examples;and requests data elements that are similar to all of the examples; as in the case of applyingrelevance feedback. Here we give the first algorithms that can handle aggregate similarityqueries on Metric Access Methods (MAM) such as the M-tree and Slim-tree. Our method;which we call Metric Aggregate Similarity Search (MASS) has the following properties:(a) itrequires only the triangle inequality property;(b) it guarantees no false-dismissals; as we …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,17
Montando questionários para medir a satisfação do usuário: avaliação de interface de um sistema que utiliza técnicas de recuperação de imagens por conteúdo,Ana Lúcia Filardi; Agma Juci Machado Traina,Abstract An attractive and intuitive design of the human-computer interface is essential to thesuccess of any computational system. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems areinherently interactive. However; little attention has been paid to their interfaces. A majordifficulty for designing the interface of these systems is to ally high quality means to integratethe querying on the images and the presentation and handling of the results. The goal of thispaper was to analyze the user interaction in CBIR systems regarding their functionality andusability. This was achieved by following the actual interaction of users while working with aCBIR system. This task allowed us to suggest a questionnaire that can properly reflect theevaluated aspects of the users interaction regarding their satisfaction degree.

In this paper we present a fast; scalable algorithm to quickly select the mostimportant attributes (dimensions) for a given set of n-dimensional vectors. In contrast to oldermethods; our method has the following desirable properties:(a) it does not do rotation ofattributes; thus leading to easy interpretation of the resulting attributes;(b) it can spotattributes that have either linear or nonlinear correlations;(c) it requires a constant number ofpasses over the dataset;(d) it gives a good estimate on how many attributes should be kept.,Journal of Information and Data Management,2010,16
The spatial-perceptual design space: a new comprehension for data visualization,José Fernando Rodrigues Jr; Agma JM Traina; Maria Cristina F De Oliveira; Caetano Traina Jr,We revisit the design space of visualizations aiming at identifying and relating itscomponents. In this sense; we establish a model to examine the process through whichvisualizations become expressive for users. This model has lead us to a taxonomy orientedto the human visual perception. The essence of this taxonomy provides natural criteria inorder to delineate a novel understanding for the design space of visualizations. From suchunderstanding; we elaborate a model for generalized design. The model poses an intuitivecomprehension for the visualization design space departing from fundamental pre-attentivestimuli and from perceptual phenomena.

Identifying Algebraic Properties to Support Optimization of Unary Similarity Queries.,Mônica Ribeiro Porto Ferreira; Agma JM Traina; Ires Dias; Richard Chbeir; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract. Conventional operators for data retrieval are either based on exact matching or ontotal order relationship among elements. Neither of them is appropriate to manage complexdata; such as multimedia data; time series and genetic sequences. In fact; the mostmeaningful way to compare complex data is by similarity. However; the Relational Algebra;employed in the Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS); cannot expresssimilarity criteria. In order to address this issue; we provide here an extension of theRelational Algebra; aimed at representing similarity queries in algebraic expressions. Thispaper identifies fundamental properties to allow the integration of the unary similarityoperators into the Relational Algebra to handle similarity-based operators; either alone orcombined with the existing (exact matching and/or relational) operators.

A support system for content-based medical image retrieval in object oriented databases,Caetano Traina; Agma JM Traina; Rildo R Dos Santos; Edna Y Senzako,Abstract This work describes both the concepts used in an Object Manager for storage ofmedical images as one more data type associated to objects; and a support systemdeveloped to offer this kind of tool to medical application developers. The purpose of thiswork is to support the retrieval of images through queries based on the graphical contents ofthe stored images. The usual approach uses icons and textual attributes stored with theimages to specify the queries. This work uses a novel modeling technique to define the“image data type;” by means of which it is possible to decide; before the query itself; the keydata of each image that must be extracted from the image when it is stored in the database;so the search can be accelerated when queries are issued. This approach enables buildingof expansible systems; where new image processing algorithms can be added easily …,Journal of Medical Systems,1997,15

Querying Multimedia Data by Similarity in Relational DBMS,Maria Camila Nardini Barioni; Daniel dos Santos Kaster; Humberto Luiz Razente; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Júnior,Abstract Multimedia objects–such as images; audio; and video–do not present the totalordering relationship; so the relational operators ('<';'=';'=';'>') are not suitable to comparethem. Therefore; similarity queries are the most useful; and often the only types of queriesadequate to search multimedia objects stored in a database. Unfortunately; the ubiquitousquery language SQL–the most widely employed language in Database ManagementSystems (DBMS)–does not provide effective support for similarity queries. This chapterpresents an already validated strategy that adds similarity queries to SQL; supporting apowerful set of similarity operators. The chapter also describes techniques to store andretrieve multimedia objects in an efficient way and shows existing DBMS alternatives toexecute similarity queries over multimedia data.,Advanced Database Query Systems: Techniques; Applications and Technologies,2011,14

In this paper; wepresent a new family of distance functions; called attribute concurrence influence distances(AID); which serve to retrieve images by similarity. These distances address an importantaspect of the psychophysical notion of similarity in comparisons of images: the effect ofconcurrent variations in the values of different image attributes. The AID functions allow forcomparisons of feature vectors by choosing one of two parameterized expressions: onetargeting weak attribute concurrence influence and the other for strong concurrenceinfluence.

Extending relational databases to support content-based retrieval of medical images,Myrian RB Araujo; Caetano Traina Jr; Agma Traina; Josiane M Bueno; Humberto L Razente,This paper shows how to support images in a relational database; so it can fulfill therequirements to be used as the storage mechanism of a PACS. This support includes theability to answer similarity queries based on the image content; providing fast image retrievalbased on indexing structures. The main concept allowing this support is the definition ofdistance functions based on features; which are extracted from the images as they arestored in the database. An extension to SQL enables the construction of an interpreter thatintercepts the extended commands and translates them into standard SQL; allowing one totake advantage of any relational database server. We describe experiments made with aprototype implemented using these concepts; which allowed answering queries up to 20times faster than using existing relational servers alone.,Computer-Based Medical Systems; 2002.(CBMS 2002).

Open issues for partitioning clustering methods: an overview,Maria Camila N Barioni; Humberto Razente; Alessandra MR Marcelino; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,Abstract Over the last decades; a great variety of data mining techniques have beendeveloped to reach goals concerning Knowledge Discovery in Databases. Among them;cluster detection techniques are of major importance. Although these techniques havealready been largely explored in the scientific literature; there are at least two importantopen issues: the existent algorithms are not scalable for large high-dimensional datasets;and the unsupervised nature of traditional data clustering makes it very difficult to generatemeaningful clusters. This article presents an overview of the strategies being explored inorder to deal more deeply with these issues. Moreover; it describes a new semi-supervisedclustering strategy that exemplifies the integration of several approaches and that can beemployed with partitioning algorithms; such as PAM and Clarans.

Does a CBIR system really impact decisions of physicians in a clinical environment?,Marcelo Ponciano-Silva; Juliana P Souza; Pedro H Bugatti; Marcos VN Bedo; Daniel S Kaster; Rosana TV Braga; Angela D Bellucci; Paulo M Azevedo-Marques; Caetano Traina; Agma JM Traina,Content-based image retrieval systems are employed in several areas. One of the mostprominent area is the medical field; due to the huge volume of digital images dailygenerated in healthcare institutions employed for decision making. There are several worksapplying CBIR techniques over medical images.

Aggregate similarity queries in relevance feedback methods for content-based image retrieval,Humberto L Razente; Maria Camila N Barioni; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract Content-based image retrieval techniques rely on automatic features extracted fromimages to process similarity queries. Usually low-level features are extracted; and when theyare used to compare images stored in a database to a reference image (through singlecenter selection queries); they often lack the ability to convey to the users what theyunderstand as similarity. To deal with the gap between what the user expects and what thesystem can automatically provide; relevance feedback techniques have been employed. Inthis paper we present a generalization of the single center similarity queries over data inmetric spaces; taking into account both range and k-nearest neighbors. Allowing a query toinclude multiple query centers; it straightforwardly attends the relevance feedbackrequirements. Thus; we analyze how well our new approach contribute to relevance …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2008,12

Evaluating the intrinsic dimension of evolving data streams,Elaine PM de Sousa; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract Data streams are fundamental in several data processing applications involvinglarge amount of data generated continuously as a sequence of events. Frequently; suchevents are not stored; so the data is analyzed and queried as they arrive and discarded rightaway. In many applications these events are represented by a predetermined number ofnumerical attributes. Thus; without loss of generality; we can consider events as elementsfrom a dimensional domain. A sequence of events in a data stream can be characterized byits intrinsic dimension; which in dimensional datasets is usually lower than the embeddingdimensionality. As the intrinsic dimension can be used to improve the performance ofalgorithms handling dimensional data (specially query optimization) measuring it is relevantto improve data streams processing and analysis as well. Moreover; it can also be useful …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2006,12

Techniques for effective and efficient fire detection from social media images,Marcos Bedo; Gustavo Blanco; Willian Oliveira; Mirela Cazzolato; Alceu Costa; Jose Rodrigues; Agma Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract: Social media could provide valuable information to support decision making incrisis management; such as in accidents; explosions and fires. However; much of the datafrom social media are images; which are uploaded in a rate that makes it impossible forhuman beings to analyze them. Despite the many works on image analysis; there are no firedetection studies on social media. To fill this gap; we propose the use and evaluation of abroad set of content-based image retrieval and classification techniques for fire detection.Our main contributions are:(i) the development of the Fast-Fire Detection method (FFDnR);which combines feature extractor and evaluation functions to support instance-basedlearning;(ii) the construction of an annotated set of images with ground-truth depicting fireoccurrences--the FlickrFire dataset; and (iii) the evaluation of 36 efficient image …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03844,2015,11
PRoSPer: Perceptual similarity queries in medical CBIR systems through user profiles,Pedro H Bugatti; Daniel S Kaster; Marcelo Ponciano-Silva; Caetano Traina Jr; Paulo M Azevedo-Marques; Agma JM Traina,Abstract In this paper; we present a novel approach to perform similarity queries overmedical images; maintaining the semantics of a given query posted by the user. Content-based image retrieval systems relying on relevance feedback techniques usually requestthe users to label relevant/irrelevant images. Thus; we present a highly effective strategy tosurvey user profiles; taking advantage of such labeling to implicitly gather the userperceptual similarity. The profiles maintain the settings desired for each user; allowingtuning of the similarity assessment; which encompasses the dynamic change of the distancefunction employed through an interactive process. Experiments on medical images showthat the method is effective and can improve the decision making process during analysis.,Computers in biology and medicine,2014,11

Efficient bulk-loading on dynamic metric access methods,Thiago G Vespa; Caetano Traina; Agma J Traina,Abstract This paper presents a new technique and two algorithms to bulk-load data into multi-way dynamic metric access methods; based on the covering radius of representativeelements employed to organize data in hierarchical data structures. The proposedalgorithms are sample-based; and they always build a valid and height-balanced tree. Wecompare the proposed algorithm with existing ones; showing the behavior to bulk-load datainto the Slim-tree metric access method. After having identified the worst case of our firstalgorithm; we describe adequate counteractions in an elegant way creating the secondalgorithm. Experiments performed to evaluate their performance show that our bulk-loadingmethods build trees faster than the sequential insertion method regarding construction time;and that it also significantly improves search performance.,Information Systems,2010,11

Including the perceptual parameter to tune the retrieval ability of pulmonary CBIR systems,Marcelo Ponciano-Silva; Agma JM Traina; Paulo M Azevedo-Marques; Joaquim C Felipe; Caetano Traina,The research on Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is growing in relevance at a fastpace. Algorithms and tools for CBIR can help decision-making processes; for exampleallowing the specialist to retrieve cases similar to the one under evaluation. However; themain reservation about using CBIR is the semantic gap; which is the divergence amongautomatic results and what the user is expecting. We propose the ldquoperceptualparameterrdquo; which allows changing the relationship between the feature extractionalgorithms and the distance functions; aimed at finding the best integration of both from thespecialist's point of view. This work integrates the three main elements of similarity queries:the extracted features from the images; the distance function employed to quantify thesimilarity and the similarity perception from the user.

Content-based retrieval of medical images: from context to perception,Pedro H Bugatti; Marcelo Ponciano-Silva; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr; Paulo Marques,A challenge in content-based retrieval of image exams is to provide a timely answer thatcomplies to the specialist's expectation. In many situations; when a specialist gets a newimage to analyze; having information and knowledge from similar cases can be very helpful.However; the semantic gap between low-level image features and their high level semanticsmay impair the system acceptability. In this paper we propose a new method where wegather from the physicians the visual patterns they use to recognize anomalies in imagesand apply this knowledge not only in the preprocessing of the images; but also on buildingfeature extractors based on these visual patterns.

The Onion-tree: quick indexing of complex data in the main memory,Caio Carélo; Ives Pola; Ricardo Ciferri; Agma Traina; Caetano Traina-Jr; Cristina de Aguiar Ciferri,Abstract Searching for elements in a dataset that are similar to a given query element is acore problem in applications that use complex data; and has been carried out aided by ametric access method (MAM). A growing number of these applications require indices thatcan be built faster and for several times; in addition to providing smaller response times forsimilarity queries. Besides; the increase in the main memory capacity and its lowering costsalso motivate using memory-based MAMs. In this paper; we propose the Onion-tree; a newand robust dynamic memory-based MAM that performs a hierarchical division of the metricspace into disjoint subspaces. The Onion-tree is very compact; requiring a small fraction ofthe main memory (eg; at most 4.8%). Comparisons of the Onion-tree; a memory-basedversion of the Slim-tree; and the memory-based MM-tree showed that the Onion-tree …,Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2009,11
A new algorithm for data discretization and feature selection,Marcela Xavier Ribeiro; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract Data discretization and feature selection are two important tasks that can beperformed prior to the learning phase of data mining algorithms and can significantly reducethe processing effort of the learning algorithm. In this paper; we present a new algorithm;called Omega; for data preprocessing. Our proposed algorithm performs simultaneouslydata discretization and feature selection. Some experiments were performed to validate theeffects of the preprocessing performed by the Omega algorithm in the results of the C4. 5algorithm (a well-known decision tree-based classifier). The results indicates that theproposed algorithm Omega is well-suited to both; data discretization and feature selection;being appropriate for data pre-processing.,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2008,11

Combining visual analytics and content based data retrieval technology for efficient data analysis,JF Rodrigues; Luciana AS Romani; Agma Juci Machado Traina; C Traina,One of the most useful techniques to help visual data analysis systems is interactive filtering(brushing). However; visualization techniques often suffer from overlap of graphical itemsand multiple attributes complexity; making visual selection inefficient. In these situations; thebenefits of data visualization are not fully observable because the graphical items do notpop up as comprehensive patterns. In this work we propose the use of content-based dataretrieval technology combined with visual analytics. The idea is to use the similarity queryfunctionalities provided by metric space systems in order to select regions of the datadomain according to user-guidance and interests. After that; the data found in such regionsfeed multiple visualization workspaces so that the user can inspect the correspondentdatasets.

The fractal dimension making similarity queries more efficient,Adriano S Arantes; Marcos R Vieira; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,ABSTRACT This paper presents a new algorithm to answer k-nearest neighbor queriescalled the Fractal k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NNF ()). This algorithm takes advantage of thefractal dimension of the dataset under scan to estimate a suitable radius to shrinks a querythat retrieves the k-nearest neighbors of a query object. k-NN () algorithms starts searchingfor elements at any distance from the query center; progressively reducing the alloweddistance used to consider elements as worth to analyze. If a proper radius can be set to startthe process; a significant reduction in the number of distance calculations can be achieved.The experiments performed with real and synthetic datasets over the access method Slim-tree; have shown that the efficiency of our approach makes the total processing time to dropup to 50%; while requires 25% less distance calculations.,Proceedings of the II ACM SIGKDD Workshop on Fractals; Power Laws and Other Next Generation Data Mining Tools,2003,9

However; searching in verylarge datasets; the basic operators often return elements too much similar both to the querycenter and to themselves; reducing the answer's utility. In this paper; we tackle the problemof providing diversity to similarity query results; and define techniques to assure that eachelement in the result set is different enough from the others. Existing techniques compel theuser to define either a parameter to trade among similarity and diversity or a minimumsimilarity between result elements. Distinctly; our approach provides similarity queries withdiversification using the influence concept; which automatically estimates the inherentdiversity between the result set elements requiring no user-defined parameters …,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2013,8

Content-based retrieval of medical images by continuous feature selection,Pedro Henrique Bugatti; Marcela Xavier Ribeiro; Agma Juci Machado Traina; C Traina,Feature selection can significantly improve the precision of content-based queries in imagedatabases by removing noisy features or by bursting the most relevant ones. Continuousfeature selection techniques assign continuous weights to each feature according to theirrelevance. In this paper; we propose a supervised method for continuous feature selection.The proposed method applies statistical association rules to find patterns relating low-levelimage features to high-level knowledge about the images; and it uses the patterns mined todetermine the weight of the features. The feature weighting through the statisticalassociation rules reduces the semantic gap that exists between low-level features and thehigh-level user interpretation of images; improving the precision of the content-basedqueries. Moreover; the proposed method performs dimensionality reduction of image …,Computer-Based Medical Systems; 2008. CBMS'08. 21st IEEE International Symposium on,2008,8

However; it has been seldom supported as a database modelingelement. This paper presents a technic to support classification as a semantic constructor;enabling its representation in target modeling. It is also shown that this concept can unify thecommands for data definition and data manipulation in query languages; thus generatingtight environments including the data model; the database management system and thesoftware design techniques. Through classification; object types and object instances can betreated in a uniform manner; allowing the unification of concepts and commands. Thisapproach is illustrated using the SIRIUS model and its schema editor.

Endowing a content-based medical image retrieval system with perceptual similarity using ensemble strategy,Marcos Vinicius Naves Bedo; Davi Pereira dos Santos; Marcelo Ponciano-Silva; Paulo Mazzoncini de Azevedo-Marques; Caetano Traina,Abstract Content-based medical image retrieval (CBMIR) is a powerful resource to improvedifferential computer-aided diagnosis. The major problem with CBMIR applications is thesemantic gap; a situation in which the system does not follow the users' sense of similarity.This gap can be bridged by the adequate modeling of similarity queries; which ultimatelydepends on the combination of feature extractor methods and distance functions. In thisstudy; such combinations are referred to as perceptual parameters; as they impact on howimages are compared. In a CBMIR; the perceptual parameters must be manually set by theusers; which imposes a heavy burden on the specialists; otherwise; the system will follow apredefined sense of similarity. This paper presents a novel approach to endow a CBMIRwith a proper sense of similarity; in which the system defines the perceptual parameter …,Journal of digital imaging,2016,7
Higiia: A perceptual medical cbir system applied to mammography classification,Marcos VN Bedo; Marcelo Ponciano-Silva; Daniel S Kaster; Pedro H Bugatti; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract. Content-Based Medical Image Retrieval (CBMIR) has been used in the medicalfield to assist several tasks; from training to computer-aided diagnosis. However; there areseveral gaps that must be filled to approximate the system's retrieval quality andperformance over large image databases to the user's similarity perception and needs. Thispaper presents the Higiia; a modularized CBMIR system that integrates several consolidatedtechniques that compose the similarity query process; including feature extractors; distancefunctions and indexing structures for complex data; and allows the user to set customparameters that best represent his/her perception. Results of experiments at the ClinicalHospital of the USP-RP are also presented; where the system is under test.,Demo and Applications Session of the XXVII Brazilian Symposium on Databases (SBBD),2012,7
Ranking evaluation functions to improve genetic feature selection in content-based image retrieval of mammograms,Sérgio Francisco da Silva; A Traina; Marcela Xavier Ribeiro; J do ES Batista Neto; Caetano Traina,The ranking problem is a crucial task in the information retrieval systems. In this paper; wetake advantage of single valued ranking evaluation functions in order to develop a newmethod of genetic feature selection tailored to improve the accuracy of content-based imageretrieval systems. We propose to boost the feature selection ability of the genetic algorithms(GA) by employing an evaluation criteria (fitness function) that relies on order-based rankingevaluation functions. The evaluation criteria are provided by the GA and has beensuccessfully employed as a measure to evaluate the efficacy of content-based imageretrieval process; improving up to 22% the precision of the query answers. Experiments onthree medical datasets containing breast cancer diagnosis and breast tissue densityanalysis showed that fitness functions based on ranking evaluation functions occupy an …,Computer-Based Medical Systems; 2009.

Easing the dimensionality curse by stretching metric spaces,Ives RV Pola; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract Queries over sets of complex elements are performed extracting features from eachelement; which are used in place of the real ones during the processing. Extracting a largenumber of significant features increases the representative power of the feature vector andimproves the query precision. However; each feature is a dimension in the representationspace; consequently handling more features worsen the dimensionality curse. The problemderives from the fact that the elements tends to distribute all over the space and a largedimensionality allows them to spread over much broader spaces. Therefore; in high-dimensional spaces; elements are frequently farther from each other; so the distancedifferences among pairs of elements tends to homogenize. When searching for nearestneighbors; the first one is usually not close; but as long as one is found; small increases …,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2009,7
Incorporating Metric Access Methods for Similarity Searching on Oracle Database.,Daniel S Kaster; Pedro Henrique Bugatti; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract. The volume of multimedia and complex data (images; videos; audio; time series;DNA sequences; and others) has been growing at a very fast pace. Thus; it is necessary tostore in databases many types of data which are not naturally handled by DatabaseManagement Systems (DBMSs). Complex data are well-suited to be queried by similarity.Many works addressed techniques for similarity searching; but the majority of them are notconceived to be integrated into a database engine. However; including similarity search intothe database core would allow taking advantage of the DBMS resources to perform queriesintegrating complex and conventional data.

Image domain formalization for content-based image retrieval,Caetano Traina; Josiel M Figueiredo; Agma JM Traina,Abstract This paper proposes a formal representation of the operations required to performcontent-based image retrieval (CBIR) in large relational databases; using similarity queries.In this paper; we consider similarity as a numerical value obtained comparing a pair ofimages; which is calculated by a distance (dissimilarity) function. Distance functions usuallyrely on a set of features extracted from each image through a set of image processingalgorithms called feature extractors. Before extracting features; other image processingalgorithms are usually employed to pre-process each image; preparing it for the extractors.Usually there are several criteria that can be considered when measuring how much twoimages are similar. Therefore; to compare images in current CBIR environments one mustdefine (1) the criteria;(2) the image pre-processing needed before the extractors can be …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2005,7

Enhancing data visualization techniques,José Fernando Rodrigues Jr; AJ Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract. The challenge in the Information Visualization (Infovis) field is two-fold: theexploration of raw data with intuitive visualization techniques and the discover of newtechniques to enhance the visualization power of well-known infovis approaches; improvingthe synergy between the user and the mining tools. This work pursues the second goal;presenting the use of interactive automatic analysis combined with visual presentation. Todemonstrate such ideas; we present three approaches aiming to improve multi-variatevisualizations. The first approach; named Frequency Plot; combines frequencies of dataoccurrences with interactive filtering to identify clusters and trends in subsets of thedatabase.

Feature Selection Guided by Perception in Medical CBIR Systems,Pedro H Bugatti; Marcela X Ribeiro; Agma JM Traina; C Traina,This work aims at developing an efficient support to improve the precision of content-basedmedical image retrieval systems and also accelerate such retrieval; introducing a novelretrieval approach that integrates techniques of feature selection and relevance feedback toperform feature selection guided by perceptual similarity. Low-level features are commonlyemployed to represent the images by content. Feature selection is performed employingstatistical association rules integrated with a relevance feedback process; tuning the miningprocess on the fly; according to the user's perception. This integration not only improves thefeature selection accuracy; but also allows personalising such process.

Improving content-based retrieval of medical images through dynamic distance on relevance feedback,Pedro H Bugatti; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,Content-based image retrieval approaches rely on automatic features extracted from imagesto perform similarity queries. The major drawback is that such features often do notsatisfactorily represent what the users understand and expect from them; eg when searchingfor similar images. In order to deal with the gap between the user semantic interpretation ofthe images and what the system can automatically provide; relevance feedback techniqueshave been employed. However; it has been used without prior analysis about the distancefunction that best suits the user intention in each relevance feedback cycle and leading tothe increase of such gap. Hence; in the present paper we employ user profiling inconjunction to content-based image retrieval and relevance feedback techniques to exploitthe user intentions and to reach the best configuration according to the user intention in …,Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS); 2011 24th International Symposium on,2011,6

Including conditional operators in content-based image retrieval in large sets of medical exams,Caetano Traina Jr; AJM Trains; JM de Figuciredo,Content-based image retrieval systems (CBIR) aim at helping in searching large imagecollections to find those more likely to answer query conditions based on the informationrepresented in the images. To speed up the search process; selected features are extractedfrom each image when they are stored in the database; so each one is represented by afeature vector. Subsequent image searching operations are performed using the featurevectors in place of the images. The feature extraction algorithms have important issues inCBIR due to the large semantic gap between the low-level features extracted as comparedto the high-level; semantic; results expected by the users. A way to approach a semanticanalysis of an image; as performed by humans; is to employ a large number of analyzerswhose results are processed by a set of rules based on if-then clauses.

Operadores de Seleção por Similaridade para Sistemas de Gerenciamento de Bases de Dados Relacionais.,Adriano S Arantes; Marcos R Vieira; Caetano Traina Jr; Agma JM Traina,Abstract Searching operations in complex datasets are performed using comparison criteriabased on similarity because equality comparison are barely useful and those based on theordering relationships cannot be applied due to the nature of these datasets. There are twobasic operators for similarity queries: Range Query and k-Nearest Neighbor Query. A greatamount of research was done to achieve effective algorithms for those operators. However;algorithms that deal with these operators as parts of a more complex operation(compositions of them) were not developed yet. This article presents two new algorithms;named kAndRange and kOrRange; which are designed to answer conjunctions anddisjunctions operations between those similarity criteria. The new algorithms were testedwith sequential scan and with a metric access method called Slim-tree. The experimental …,SBBD,2003,6
Use of a semantically grained database system for distribution and control within design environments,Caetano Traina Jr; João Eduardo Ferreira; Mauro Biajiz,Abstract This paper presents a technique to share the data stored in an object-orienteddatabase aimed at designing environments. This technique shares data between tworelated databases; called the Original and Product databases; and is composed of threeprocesses: data separation; evolution and integration. Whenever a block of data needs to beshared; it is spread into both databases; resulting in a block on the original database; andanother into the Product database; with special links between them controlled by the ObjectManager. These blocks do not need to be maintained identical during the evolution phase ofthe sharing process. Six types of links were defined. and by choosing one; the designercontrol the evolution and reintegration of the block in both databases. This process uses thecomposite object concept as the unit of control. The presented concepts can be applied to …,European Conference on Parallel Processing,1997,6
Improving the pruning ability of dynamic metric access methods with local additional pivots and anticipation of information,Paulo H Oliveira; Caetano Traina; Daniel S Kaster,Abstract Metric Access Methods (MAMs) have been proved to allow performing similarityqueries over complex data more efficiently than other access methods. They can beconsidered dynamic or static depending on the pivot type used in their construction. Globalpivots tend to compromise the dynamicity of MAMs; as eventual pivot-related updates mustbe propagated through the entire structure; while local pivots allow this maintenance tooccur locally. Several applications handle online complex data and; consequently; demandefficient dynamic indexes to be successful. In this context; this work presents two techniquesfor improving the pruning ability of dynamic MAMs:(i) using cutting local additional pivots toreduce distance calculations and (ii) anticipating information from child nodes to reduceunnecessary disk accesses.

A statistical associative classifier with automatic estimation of parameters on computer aided diagnosis,Carolina YV Watanabe; Marcela X Ribeiro; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,In this paper; we proposed a classifier based on statistical association rules that avoids thediscretization step and automatically estimates the input thresholds. The algorithmautomatically selects the most significant features to produce rules. These rules are simple;including the selected features; a single interval in the antecedent of the rule and a labelclass in the consequent; and getting at most twice the number of rules features. To evaluateour method; we compare it with traditional classifiers as C4. 5 and Adaboost; in the task ofclassifying benign or malign masses of mammograms; usingtwo different real datasets. Theproposed method achieve the best results regarding accuracy; sensitivity and sensibility.,Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA); 2012 11th International Conference on,2012,5
A new feature descriptor derived from Hilbert space-filling curve to assist breast cancer classification,Denise Guliato; Walter Alexandre A de Oliveira; Caetano Traina,Malignant breast tumors and benign masses appear in mammograms with different shapecharacteristics: the former usually have rough; spiculated; or microlobulated contours;whereas the latter commonly have smooth; round; oval; or macrolobulated contours. Visualfeatures that characterize shape roughness can assist in distinguishing between malignanttumors and benign masses in mammo-grams. Here we propose a new approach based onHilbert curves to classify breast masses as benign or malignant. The feature extraction isperformed in linear time; and is amenable to parallel processing; whereas the classificationphase can be performed by a classical neural networks structure. We evaluated our methodusing a set of 111 contours from 65 benign masses and 46 malignant tumors.

Time-aware similarity search: a metric-temporal representation for complex data,Renato Bueno; Daniel S Kaster; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract Recent advances in information technology demand handling complex data types;such as images; video; audio; time series and genetic sequences. Distinctly from traditionaldata (such as numbers; short strings and dates); complex data do not possess the totalordering property; yielding relational comparison operators useless. Even equalitycomparisons are of little help; as it is very unlikely to have two complex elements exactlyequal. Therefore; the similarity among elements has emerged as the most important propertyfor comparisons in such domains; leading to the growing relevance of metric spaces to datasearch. Regardless of the data domain properties; the systems need to track evolution ofdata over time. When handling multidimensional data; temporal information is commonlytreated as just one or more dimensions. However; metric data do not have the concept of …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2009,5
A new approach for optimization of dynamic metric access methods using an algorithm of effective deletion,Renato Bueno; Daniel dos Santos Kaster; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract The existing Metric Access Methods (MAM) assume the data elements representimmutable objects. However; many applications must handle complex data evolving overtime. Health care; weather monitoring; and other applications require removing or updatingelements. Most of the MAM presented in the literature either do not have the deletionoperation described; or it is performed just marking the element as deleted withouteffectively removing it from the structure. In this paper we describe an algorithm thateffectively removes any element from a metric tree. While maintaining the height-balancingof the structure; the proposed deletion algorithm uses mechanisms to enforce a reducednumber of pages in the tree; improving the query performance. Based on the deletionalgorithm; we propose a new way to optimize a MAM; which we call the Push-pull …,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2008,5

Bulk-loading Dynamic Metric Access Methods.,Thiago Galbiatti Vespa; Caetano Traina Jr; Agma JM Traina,Abstract. The main contribution of this paper is a bulk-loading algorithm for multi-waydynamic metric access methods based on the covering radius of a representative; like theSlim-tree. The proposed algorithm is sample-based; and it builds a height-balanced tree in atop-down fashion; using the metric domain's distance function and a bound limit to groupand determine the number of elements in each partition of the dataset at each step of thealgorithm. Experiments performed to drill its performance shows that our bulk-loadingmethod is up to 6 times faster to build a tree than the sequential insertion method regardingconstruction time; and that it improves the search performance too.,SBBD,2007,5

Nearest Neighbor Queries with Counting Aggregate-based Conditions,Daniel S Kaster; Willian D Oliveira; Renato Bueno; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract The amount of complex data; such as images; videos and time series; has beenincreasing in the past few years in a very fast pace. The main property employed to querysuch kind of data based on its content is the similarity between elements. One of the mostcommon similarity queries is the k-Nearest Neighbor query (k-NNq); which returns the kelements most similar to a given reference element. Although this kind of query is useful formany applications; it does not consider additional conditions that may modify the basicnearest neighbor search; which would allow retrieving more relevant information to the user.Complex data are usually associated with other information and usually have metadatadescribing the data content and/or context.

Based on the knowledge mined; eachquery posed is rewritten in order to better meet the user expectations. We propose anextension of SQL aimed at exploring mining processes over complex data; generatingassociation rules that extract semantic information from the textual description superimposedto the extracted features; thereafter using them to rewrite the queries. As a result; the systemobtains results closer to the user expectation than it could using only the traditional; plainsimilarity query execution.,Journal of Information and Data Management,2010,4

SID: Calculating the intrinsic dimension of data streams,Elaine PM de Sousa; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,ABSTRACT Data streams are fundamental in several data processing applications involvinglarge amount of data generated continuously as a sequence of events. Usually; such eventsare transient and do not need to be stored on disk; so the data are analyzed as they areobtained and discarded right away. In the majority of applications; all the events of a datastream have a fixed number of attributes; so events are elements from a dimensionaldomain. As in any dimensional dataset; the data stream can be characterized by an intrinsicdimensionality; which is usually lower than its embedded dimensionality and that affects theperformance of algorithms used to handle the data. Therefore; it is relevant to measure theintrinsic dimensionality of this type of data. In this paper we present the first ever publishedalgorithm able to measure the intrinsic dimension of datasets on the fly; following the …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM symposium on Applied Computing,2006,4
Visualization tree; multiple linked analytical decisions,José F Rodrigues Jr; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract In this paper we tackle the main problem presented by the majority of InformationVisualization techniques; that is; the limited number of data items that can be visualizedsimultaneously. Our approach proposes an innovative and interactive systematization thatcan augment the potential for data presentation by utilizing multiple views. These multiplepresentation views are kept linked according to the analytical decisions took by the user andare tracked in a tree-like structure. Our emphasis is on developing an intuitive yet powerfulsystem that helps the user to browse the information and to make decisions based both onoverview and on detailed perspectives of the data under analysis. The visualization treekeeps track of the interactive actions taken by the user without losing context.,International Symposium on Smart Graphics,2005,4
Accelerating approximate similarity queries using genetic algorithms,Renato Bueno; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,Abstract Searching for the exact answer to a similarity query is an expensive processconsidering computational resources; such as memory and processing time requirements.Moreover; comparison operations over multimedia data is even more expensive than overtraditional data such as numbers and small character strings. Therefore; when comparingmultimedia data; the comparison computations usually consider some properties extractedfrom the data elements. In this way; exact queries involving this kind of data return data thatis exact regarding the properties compared; but not necessarily exact regarding themultimedia data itself. For example; searching for similar images regarding their colorsreturn images whose color histogram are the most similar; but the retrieved images can bevery different regarding; for instance; the shape the objects pictured. Therefore; for …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2005,4

Integrando Textura e Forma para a Recuperação de Imagens por Conteúdo,André GR Balan; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr; Paulo M Azevedo-Marques,Resumo-Este artigo apresenta uma nova abordagem de recuperação de imagens porconteúdo que utiliza um conjunto de características extraídas a partir da imagemsegmentada com base em textura. O algoritmo de segmentação implementa um processoestocástico e tem como base os Campos Aleatórios de Markov. A segmentação éautomática e tem como parâmetro o número de classes com texturas diferentes. As regiõesobtidas na segmentação guiam a extração de medidas da imagem segmentada e daimagem original; produzindo um vetor de característica de 30 dimensões; utilizado paracaracterizar o conteúdo da imagem. Experimentos realizados revelaram que o conjunto decaracterísticas proposto tem um alto poder de discriminação quando comparado comtécnicas mais tradicionais de distribuição de brilho (histograma).,IX Congresso Brasileiro de Informática em Saúde-CBIS,2004,4
Visually Mining on Multiple Relational Tables at Once,Maria Camila Barioni; Humberto Razente; Caetano Traina Jr; Agma Traina,Abstract. Data mining (DM) processes require data to be supplied in only one table or datafile. Therefore; data stored in multiple relations of relational databases must be joined beforesubmission to DM analysis. A problem faced during this preparation step is that; most of thetimes; the analyst does not have a clear idea of what portions of data should be mined. Thispaper reckons the strong human ability to interpret data in graphical format to develop aprocess called “wagging”; to visualize data from multiple relations; helping the analyst whenpreparing data to DM. The data obtained from the wagging process allow to execute furtherprocesses as if they were operating over multiple relations; bringing the join operations tobecome part of the data mining process. Experimental evaluation shows that the waggingprocess reduces the join cost significantly; turning it possible to visually explore data from …,ADBIS Research Communications,2002,4

Unveiling smoke in social images with the SmokeBlock approach,Mirela T Cazzolato; Marcos VN Bedo; Alceu F Costa; Jessica Andressa de Souza; Caetano Traina Jr; Jose F Rodrigues Jr; Agma JM Traina,Abstract Can we use information from social media and crowdsourced images to detectsmoke and assist rescue forces? While there are computer vision methods for detectingsmoke; they require movement information extracted from video data. In this paper wepropose SmokeBlock: a method that is able to segment and detect smoke in still images.SmokeBlock uses superpixel segmentation and extracts local color and texture features fromimages to spot smoke. We used real data from Flickr and compared SmokeBlock againststate-of-the-art methods for feature extraction. Our method achieved performance superiorthan the competitors; for the task of smoke detection.

Self similarity wide-joins for near-duplicate image detection,Luiz Olmes Carvalho; Lúcio FD Santos; Willian D Oliveira; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,Near-duplicate image detection plays an important role in several real applications. Suchtask is usually achieved by applying a clustering algorithm followed by refinement steps;which is a computationally expensive process. In this paper we introduce a frameworkbased on a novel similarity join operator; which is able both to replace and speed up theclustering step; whereas also releasing the need of further refinement processes. It is basedon absolute and relative similarity ratios; ensuring that top ranked image pairs are in the finalresult. Experiments performed on real datasets shows that our proposal is up to three ordersof magnitude faster than the best techniques in the literature; always returning a high-qualityresult set.,Multimedia (ISM); 2015 IEEE International Symposium on,2015,3
A new concept of sets to handle similarity in databases: the simsets,Ives RV Pola; Robson LF Cordeiro; Caetano Traina Jr; Agma JM Traina,Abstract Traditional DBMS are heavily dependent on the concept that a set never includesthe same element twice. On the other hand; modern applications require dealing withcomplex data; such as images; videos and genetic sequences; in which exact match of twoelements seldom occurs and; generally; is meaningless. Thus; it makes sense that sets ofcomplex data should not include two elements that are “too similar”. How to create a conceptequivalent to “sets” for complex data? And how to design novel algorithms that allow it to benaturally embedded in existing DBMS? These are the issues that we tackle in this paper;through the concept of “similarity sets”; or SimSets for short. Several scenarios may benefitfrom our SimSets. A typical example appears in sensor networks; in which SimSets canidentify sensors recurrently reporting similar measurements; aimed at turning some of …,International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications,2013,3
k-Gabor: A new feature extraction method for medical images providing internal analysis,Gabriel Humpire-Mamani; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,This paper proposes the k-Gabor method; a new image feature extractor that capturestexture information from medical image regions without a costly segmentation usuallyassociated to texture extractors. It employs Gabor filters; thus; the k-Gabor method canquantify texture information from specific regions; tissues and internal structures of theimages providing a succint representation for a richer image analysis. The feature vectorsgenerated describe the images more precisely than other methods from the literature; asshown in the experiments. Besides providing meaningful information from the images; thecost to obtain it is very small; since the total time to extract the k-Gabor features was alwaysonly fractions of seconds.,Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS); 2012 25th International Symposium on,2012,3
Using visual analysis to weight multiple signatures to discriminate complex data,Renato Bueno; Daniel S Kaster; Humberto Luiz Razente; Maria Camila Nardini Barioni; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,Complex data is usually represented through signatures; which are sets of featuresdescribing the data content. Several kinds of complex data allow extracting differentsignatures from an object; representing complementary data characteristics. However; thereis no ground truth of how balancing these signatures to reach an ideal similarity distribution.It depends on the analyst intent; that is; according to the job he/she is performing; a fewsignatures should have more impact in the data distribution than others. This work presentsa new technique; called Visual Signature Weighting (ViSW); which allows interactivelyanalyzing the impact of each signature in the similarity of complex data represented throughmultiple signatures. Our method provides means to explore the tradeoff of prioritizingsignatures over the others; by dynamically changing their weight relation.

Integrating user preference to similarity queries over medical images datasets,Mônica RP Ferreira; Marcelo Ponciano-Silva; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina; Sandra de Amo; Fabíola SF Pereira; Richard Chbeir,Large amounts of images from medical exams are being stored in databases; so developingretrieval techniques is an important research problem. Retrieval based on the image visualcontent is usually better than using textual descriptions; as they seldom gives every nuancesthat the user may be interested in. Content-based image retrieval employs the similarityamong images for retrieval. However; similarity is evaluated using numeric methods; andthey often orders the images by similarity in a way rather distinct from the user's intention. Inthis paper; we propose a technique to allow expressing the user's preference over attributesassociated to the images; so similarity queries can be refined by preference rules.Experiments performed over a dataset with computed tomography lung images shows thatcorrectly expressing the user's preferences; the similarity query precision can increase …,Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS); 2010 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on,2010,3

Improving cbir using feature extraction based on wavelet transform,Carolina W Silva; Pedro H Bugatti; Marcela X Ribeiro; Caetano Traina Jr; Agma JM Traina,Abstract The" gap semantic" and the" curse of dimensionality" are two shortcomings ofcontent-based image retrieval techniques that rely on automatic feature extracted fromimages to process similarity queries. The first one represents the semantic gap that existsbetween low-level features automatically extracted by a computational system; and the high-level user interpretation of images. The second one involves problems occurring whensimilarity is defined over high-dimensional feature spaces. This paper shows a method thatdeals with these both shortcomings. We use discrete wavelet transforms to obtain the imagerepresentation from a multiresolution point of view. The feature vectors were composed ofthe features from the approximation subspace; which succinctly represent the images in theprocessing of similarity queries. In addition; the multiresolution method was used to …,Proceedings of the 14th Brazilian Symposium on Multimedia and the Web,2008,3

Boosting k-Nearest Neighbor Queries Estimating Suitable Query Radii,Marcos R Vieira; C Traina; Agma JM Traina; Adriano Arantes; Christos Faloutsos,This paper proposes novel and effective techniques to estimate a radius to answer k-nearestneighbor queries. The first technique targets datasets where it is possible to learn thedistribution about the pairwise distances between the elements; generating a globalestimation that applies to the whole dataset. The second technique targets datasets wherethe first technique cannot be employed; generating estimations that depend on where thequery center is located. The proposed k-NNF () algorithm combines both techniques;achieving remarkable speedups. Experiments performed on both real and synthetic datasetshave shown that the proposed algorithm can accelerate k-NN queries more than 26 timescompared with the incremental algorithm and spends half of the total time compared with thetraditional k-NN () algorithms.,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2007.

Constrained Aggregate Similarity Queries in Metric Spaces.,Humberto Luiz Razente; Maria Camila Nardini Barioni; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract. The optimization of similarity queries using metric access methods has been widelydiscussed in the last decades. Similarity queries consider one object as the query center;and retrieve objects that are either far up to a radius or the nearest ones. Another importantretrieval operation; less studied so far; is the Aggregate Similarity Query; which retrievesobjects with the smallest aggregate distances to a set of query centers. This paper presentsthe definition of Circumscription-Constrained Aggregate Similarity Queries; discussesperformance issues involved; and proposes an optimization based on the triangle inequalityto reduce the number of distance calculations and disk accesses needed to answer thequeries.,SBBD,2007,3
Perceptual distance functions for similarity retrieval of medical images,Joaquim Cezar Felipe; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract A challenge already opened for a long time concerning Content-based ImageRetrieval (CBIR) systems is how to define a suitable distance function to measure thesimilarity between images regarding an application context; which complies with the humanspecialist perception of similarity. In this paper; we present a new family of distancefunctions; namely; Attribute Interaction Influence Distances (AID); aiming at retrieving imagesby similarity. Such measures address an important aspect of psychophysical comparisonbetween images: the effect in the interaction on the variations of the image features. The AIDfunctions allow comparing feature vectors using two parameterized expressions: onetargeting weak feature interaction; and another for strong interaction.

Tracking the intrinsic dimension of evolving data streams to update association rules,Elaine PM De Sousa; Marcela X Ribeiro; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract. Data streams can change their behavior over time and; when a significant changeoccurs; the rules governing the attributes reported by each event can also change.Moreover; data streams can be composed of events from several classes; and the rulesgoverning the events of each class can also change depending on actual properties of thedata. In this paper we propose a new technique to continuously identify which are the mostrelevant attributes to characterize each class; based on the general properties exhibited bythe data stream as it evolves over time.,Proc. of workshop on Data Streams–ICML,2006,3

Efficient algorithms to execute complex similarity queries in RDBMS,Adriano S Arantes; Marcos R Vieira; Caetano Traina Jr; Agma JM Traina,ABSTRACT Search operations in large sets of complex objects usually rely on similarity-based criteria; due to the lack of other general properties that could be used to compare theobjects; such as the total order relationship; or even the equality relationship between pairsof objects; commonly used with data in numeric or short texts domains. Therefore; similaritybetween objects is the core criterion to compare complex objects. There are two basicoperators for similarity queries: Range Query and k-Nearest Neighbors Query. Muchresearch has been done to develop effective algorithms to implement them as standaloneoperations. However; algorithms to support these operators as parts of more complexexpressions involving their composition were not developed yet.

Aumento da eficiência das estruturas de indexação métricas com uso de conceitos da lógica nebulosa,Claudio Haruo Yamamoto; Mauro Biajiz; Caetano Traina,Abstract The retrieval of complex data eg image; audio; video; genomic sequences etc. inDatabase Management Systems (DBMSs) has been in the focus of the academic communityand of DBMSs developers. The most promising technique is the content-based search; inwhich a set of descriptors with high discrimination power is extracted from each dataelement; and a feature vector is obtained and used to index the data to fasten the searchoperations. The feature vectors are data in high dimensional spatial domains or metricdomains; and its indexing requires the use of appropriate indexing structures. The mostpromising structures are the ones for metric domains; eg the M-tree; the Slim-tree; the OMNI-Family and the DF-tree.

Complex-Network Tools to Understand the Behavior of Criminality in Urban Areas,Gabriel Spadon; Lucas C Scabora; Marcus VS Araujo; Paulo H Oliveir; Bruno B Machado; Elaine PM Sousa; Caetano Traina; Jose F Rodrigues,Abstract Complex networks are nowadays employed in several applications. Modelingurban street networks is one of them; and in particular to analyze criminal aspects of a city.Several research groups have focused on such application; but until now; there is a lack of awell-defined methodology for employing complex networks in a whole crime analysisprocess; ie from data preparation to a deep analysis of criminal communities. Furthermore;the “toolset” available for those works is not complete enough; also lacking techniques tomaintain up-to-date; complete crime datasets and proper assessment measures. In thissense; we propose a threefold methodology for employing complex networks in thedetection of highly criminal areas within a city.

A Label-Scaled Similarity Measure for Content-Based Image Retrieval,Gustavo Blanco; Marcos VN Bedo; Mirela T Cazzolato; Lucio FD Santos; Ana Elisa Serafim Jorge; Caetano Traina; Paulo M Azevedo-Marques; Agma JM Traina,Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) has proven to be a suitable complement totraditional text-based searching. CBIR applications rely on two main steps; namely therepresentation of the images; and the similarity measuring between two representedimages. Although modern segmentation and learning algorithms enable the accuraterepresentation of local and global features within an image; how to properly compare thesegmented objects is still an open issue. In this study; we propose a new comparisonmethod called Counting-Labels Similarity Measure (CL-Measure).

Fire detection on unconstrained videos using color-aware spatial modeling and motion flow,Letricia PS Avalhais; Jose Rodrigues; Agma JM Traina,The semantic segmentation of events on emergency contexts involves the identification ofpreviously defined events of interest. In this work; the focused semantic event is thepresence of fire in videos. The literature presents several methods for automatic video firedetection; but these methods were built under assumptions; such as stationary cameras andcontrolled lightening conditions that are often in contrast to the videos acquired by hand-held devices. To fulfill this gap; we propose a fire detection method; called SPATFIRE. Ourmethod innovates on three aspects:(1) it relies on a specifically tailored color model namedFire-like Pixel Detector able to improve the accuracy of fire detection;(2) it employs a newtechnique for motion compensation; diminishing the problems observed in videos capturedwith non-stationary cameras; and;(3) it defines a segmentation method able to identify …,Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI); 2016 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2016,2
Efficient self-similarity range wide-joins fostering near-duplicate image detection in emergency scenarios,Luiz Olmes Carvalho; Lúcio FD Santos; Willian Dener de Oliveira; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Caetano Traina Junior,Crowdsourcing information is being increasingly employed to improve and support decisionmaking in emergency situations. However; the gathered records quickly become too similaramong themselves and handling several similar reports does not add valuable knowledgeto assist the helping personnel at the control center in their decision making tasks. The usualapproaches to detect and handle the so-called near-duplicate data rely on costly twofoldprocessing. Aimed at reducing the cost and also improving the ability of duplicationdetection; we developed a framework model based on the similarity wide-join databaseoperator.

Similarity joins and beyond: an extended set of binary operators with order,Luiz Olmes Carvalho; Lucio FD Santos; Willian D Oliveira; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Caetano Traina,Abstract Similarity joins are troublesome database operators that often produce results muchlarger than the user really needs or expects. In order to return the similar elements; similarityjoins also require sorting during the retrieval process; although order is a concept notsupported in the relational model. This paper proposes a solution to solve those two issuesextending the similarity join concept to a broader set of binary operators; which aims atretrieving the most similar pairs and embedding the sorting operation only as an internalprocessing step; so as to comply with the relational theory. Additionally; our extension allowsto explore another useful condition not previously considered in the similarity retrieval: thenegation of predicates.

The NOBH-tree: Improving in-memory metric access methods by using metric hyperplanes with non-overlapping nodes,Ives Renê Venturini Pola; Caetano Traina; Agma Juci Machado Traina,Abstract In order to speed up similarity query evaluation; index structures divide the targetdataset into subsets aimed at finding the answer without examining the entire dataset. As thecomplexity of the data types handled by modern applications keeps growing; searching bysimilarity becomes increasingly interesting; that makes the Metric Space Theory as thetheoretical base to build the structures employed to index complex data. Also; as the mainmemory capacity grows and the price decreases; increasingly larger databases can becompletely indexed in the main-memory. Thus; more and more applications require the database management systems to quickly build indexes that can take advantage of memory-based indexes. In this paper; we propose a new family of metric access methods; calledNOBH-trees that allow a non-overlapping division of the data space; combining Voronoi …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2014,2

Using sub-dictionaries for image representation based on the bag-of-visual-words approach,Glauco Vitor Pedrosa; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) is a well known approach to represent images for visualrecognition and retrieval tasks. This approach represents an image as a histogram of visualwords and the dissimilarity between two images is measured by comparing thosehistograms. When performing comparisons involving a specific type of images; some visualwords can be more informative and discriminative than others. To take advantage of this fact;assigning appropriate weights can improve the performance of image retrieval. In this paper;we developed a novel modeling approach based on sub dictionaries. We extracted a sub-dictionary as a subset of visual words that best represents a specific image class. Tomeasure the dissimilarity distance between images; we take into account the distance of thehistogram obtained using the visual dictionary and the distances of the sub histograms …,2014 IEEE 27th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems,2014,2

Evaluating the Diversification of Similarity Query Results,Lucio F D Santos; Willian D Oliveira; Mônica RP Ferreira; Robson LF Cordeiro; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract The data currently generated and collected increase not only in volume; but also incomplexity; requiring new query operators to be searched. Similarity queries have beenacknowledged as one of the most useful resources to retrieve complex data; but the basicsimilarity operators are not enough to meet the requirements of the applications; largelybecause their result sets tend to include many elements too similar to the query center andamong themselves. To tackle this problem; variations and extensions of basic operatorshave been studied pursuing result diversification; ie; to search for elements sufficientlysimilar to the query center; but also diverse from each other. Result diversification has beenstudied considering either extra information related to the data or the distance among resultset elements. The problem with the former approach is that''extra information''rarely exists …,Journal of Information and Data Management,2013,2
A Similarity-Based Approach for Financial Time Series Analysis and Forecasting,Marcos Vinicius Naves Bedo; Davi Pereira dos Santos; Daniel S Kaster; Caetano Traina,Abstract Financial time series analysis have been attracting research interest for severalyears. Many works have been proposed to perform economic series forecasting; however; itstill is a hard endeavor to develop a general model that is able to handle the chaotic natureof the markets. Artificial intelligence methods such as artificial neural networks and supportvector machines arose as promising alternatives; but they hide the processing semantics;limiting the result interpretation. In addition; one of the main drawbacks of the existingsolutions is that they usually cannot be easily employed as building blocks of new analysistools.

Feature space optimization for content-based image retrieval,Letricia PS Avalhais; Sergio F da Silva; Jose F Rodrigues Jr; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract Substantial benefits can be gained from effective Relevance Feedback techniquesin content-based image retrieval. However; existing techniques are limited due tocomputational cost and/or by being restricted to linear transformations on the data. In thisstudy we analyze the role of nonlinear transformations in relevance feedback. We presenttwo promising Relevance Feedback methods based on Genetic Algorithms used to enhancethe performance on the task of image retrieval according to the user's interests. The firstmethod adjusts the dissimilarity function by using weighting functions while the secondmethod redefines the features space by means of linear and nonlinear transformationfunctions.

The Similarity Cloud Model: A novel and efficient hippocampus segmentation technique,Fredy EC Athó; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina; Paula RB Diniz,This work presents a new segmentation model called Similarity Cloud Model (SCM) basedon hippocampus feature extraction. The segmentation process is divided in two mainoperations: localization by similarity and cloud adjustment. The first process uses the cloudto localize the most probable position of the hippocampus in a target volume. Segmentationis completed by a reformulation of the cloud to correct the final labeling; based on a newcomputation of arc-weights. This method has been tested in an entire dataset of 235 MRIcombining healthy and epileptic patients. Results indicate superior quality segmentation incomparison with similar graph and bayesian-based models.,Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS); 2011 24th International Symposium on,2011,2
Integrating user profile in medical CBIR systems to answer perceptual similarity queries,Pedro H Bugatti; Daniel S Kaster; Marcelo Ponciano-Silva; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Techniques for Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) have been intensively explored dueto the increase in the amount of captured images and the need of fast retrieval of them. Themedical field is a specific example that generates a large flow of information; especiallydigital images employed for diagnosing. One issue that still remains unsolved deals withhow to reach the perceptual similarity. That is; to achieve an effective retrieval; one mustcharacterize and quantify the perceptual similarity regarding the specialist in the field.Therefore; the present paper was conceived to fill in this gap creating a consistent support toperform similarity queries over medical images; maintaining the semantics of a given querydesired by the user. CBIR systems relying in relevance feedback techniques usually requestthe users to label relevant images. In this paper; we present a simple but highly effective …,SPIE Medical Imaging,2011,2

Sugar cane is one of the most important crops for the Brazilian economy; especiallybecause it is the main source for ethanol production; replacing fossil fuels. The recentdevelopment of bi-fuel engines has further increased demand for ethanol; which is one ofthe most important derivatives of sugar cane. Recently; remote sensing imagery has beenwidely used to monitor sugar cane harvests and to support scientific research. However; withthe advancement of remote sensing technology; large amounts of data have beengenerated and therefore the analysis and discovery of useful knowledge from these datahave became essential tasks to assist research works.

Issues and techniques to mitigate the performance gap in content-based image retrieval systems,Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr; Robson Cordeiro; Marcela Xavier Ribeiro; Paulo M Azevedo-Marques,Abstract This chapter discusses key aspects concerning the performance of Content-basedImage Retrieval (CBIR) systems. The so-called performance gap plays an important roleregarding the acceptability of CBIR systems by the users. It provides a timely answer to theactual demand for computational support from CBIR systems that provide similarity queriesprocessing. Focusing on the performance gap; this chapter explains and discusses the mainproblems currently under investigation: the use of many features to represent images; thelack of appropriate indexing structures to retrieve images and features; deficient query plansemployed to execute similarity queries; and the poor quality of results obtained by the CBIRsystem.

Improving medical image retrieval through multi-descriptor similarity functions and association rules,Renato Bueno; Marcela X Ribeiro; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems still face the problem of low precision ofsystem results. To improve the precision of such systems; many image visual extractors havebeen developed and employed to represent the images. However; the usage of a largenumber of extractors and consequently; a large number of features; leads to the“dimensionality curse”; where the retrieval performance and the query accuracy diminish. Inthis paper; we propose a new method; called Statistical Fractal-scaled Product Metric(SFPM); to maximize the accuracy of CBIR systems and speedup similarity queries. TheSFPM method combines association rule mining and the Fractal-scaled Product Metric(FPM)[4]; to determine a reduced set of features and appropriate scale factors in multi-descriptor image similarity assessment. The FPM is an unsupervised method to …,Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS); 2010 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on,2010,2
Metric data analysis enhanced through temporal visualization,Renato Bueno; Humberto L Razente; Daniel S Kaster; Maria Camila N Barioni; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,The human vision can naturally interpret data in spaces of 2 or 3 dimensions. When data isin higher dimensional spaces; in most cases the visualization is not intuitive. Regardingmetric spaces; the interpretation is even harder; since they often do not have a direct spatialrepresentation. However; the need to analyze how metric-represented data evolve over timeis pretty common when one needs to understand several phenomena and in decisionmaking processes; as it occurs in medical and agrometeorological applications. This paperpresents three interactive techniques to visualize metric data that vary over time. Each onefocus on a different way to interpret the temporal information. The first technique shows dataevolving in a timeline axis. The second overlaps evolving snapshots of the space showinghow the space varies regarding time. The last one does not treat temporal data as a …,Information Visualisation (IV); 2010 14th International Conference,2010,2

A new method to efficiently reduce histogram dimensionality,Pedro H Bugatti; Agma JM Traina; Joaquim C Felipe; Caetano Traina Jr,A challenge in Computer-Aided Diagnosis based on image exams is to provide a timelyanswer that complies to the specialist's expectation. In many situations; when a specialistgets a new image to analyze; having information and knowledge from similar cases can bevery helpful. For example; when a radiologist evaluates a new image; it is common to recallsimilar cases from the past. However; when performing similarity queries to retrieve similarcases; the approach frequently adopted is to extract meaningful features from the imagesand searching the database based on such features. One of the most popular image featureis the gray-level histogram; because it is simple and fast to obtain; providing the global gray-level distribution of the image. Moreover; normalized histograms are also invariant to affinetransformations on the image. Although vastly used; gray-level histograms generates a …,Medical Imaging,2008,2

Visually Interacting with k-medoid-based Algorithms⋆,Maria Camila N Barioni; Humberto L Razente; GS Fedel; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract. Although database management systems supply basic tools to data recovery andanalysis through standard transactions in large amounts of data; the analysis of these datain high dimensional spaces is an overwhelming job. On the other hand; human beings havea great capacity to quickly absorb and understand information presented in graphical form.As data clustering is one of the key techniques in the KDD process; this work aims to use thehuman visual perception to help in the iterative clustering analysis done by the k-medoid-based algorithms. Our technique takes advantages of the interpretation obtained from theuser; through his interaction with the presented visualizations; and allows subsequent dataanalysis tasks to use these results automatically.,3rd ADBIS Workshop on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery-ADMKD,2007,2

A Tool for Content-Based Image Retrieval in Object-Oriented Databases.,Caetano Traina Jr; Agma JM Traina; Rildo R dos Santos; Edna Y Senzako,Abstract Conventional image processing algorithms used to compare images are verytimeconsuming; making them inappropriate for use in searching for an image in a hugecollection of images stored in a database. The usual approach uses icons and textualattributes stored with the images to specify the queries. However; this approach depends onhuman analysis of each image; which reduces the precision to a great extent. This workstates that it is possible to quickly retrieve a set of characteristics from each image as it isbeing stored in the database; building an index structure based on each characteristic; soimages can be retrieved through queries based on the graphic contents of the storedimages. When a search for a specific image becomes necessary; these same characteristicscan be extracted from that image; and the set of indexes can be used to narrow the …,IADT,1998,2

One index to dominate them all: domain indexes for improving queries across multiple tables,Paulo H Oliveira; Lucas C Scabora; Caetano Traina; Daniel S Kaster,Abstract Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) organize data into relations;representing them as tables. Most of queries executed over them are optimized by indexstructures. However; considering queries that require scanning indexes across multipletables; the common approach involves scanning multiple indexes and combining theirresults; which is potentially costly; especially regarding similarity queries over complex data.This paper proposes a new type of index for modern RDBMS called domain index. Suchproposal consists of indexes that allow searching columns of the same type; across multipletables; with a single index scan; hence with superior performance. To evaluate our proposal;we carried out experiments (i) over a medical image dataset; to evaluate the performance incontent-based similarity queries; and (ii) over a flow-based intrusion detection dataset; to …,Proceedings of the Symposium on Applied Computing,2017,1
Diversity in similarity joins,Lucio FD Santos; Luiz Olmes Carvalho; Willian D Oliveira; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract With the increasing ability of current applications to produce and consume morecomplex data; such as images and geographic information; the similarity join has attractedconsiderable attention. However; this operator does not consider the relationship among theelements in the answer; generating results with many pairs similar among themselves;which does not add value to the final answer. Result diversification methods are intended toretrieve elements similar enough to satisfy the similarity conditions; but also considering thediversity among the elements in the answer; producing a more heterogeneous result withsmaller cardinality; which improves the meaning of the answer. Still; diversity have beenstudied only when applied to unary operations. In this paper; we introduce the concept ofdiverse similarity joins: a similarity join operator that ensures a smaller; more diversified …,International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications,2015,1
Similarity sets: A new concept of sets to seamlessly handle similarity in database management systems,IRV Pola; Robson Leonardo Ferreira Cordeiro; C Traina; Agma Juci Machado Traina,Abstract Besides integers and short character strings; current applications require storingphotos; videos; genetic sequences; multidimensional time series; large texts and severalother types of “complex” data elements. Comparing them by equality is a fundamentalconcept for the Relational Model; the data model currently employed in most DatabaseManagement Systems. However; evaluating the equality of complex elements is usuallysenseless; since exact match almost never happens. Instead; it is much more significant toevaluate their similarity. Consequently; the set theoretical concept that a set cannot includethe same element twice also becomes senseless for data “sets” that must be handled bysimilarity; suggesting that a new; equivalent definition must take place for them. Targetingthis problem; this paper introduces the new concept of “similarity sets”; or SimSets for …,Information Systems,2015,1
Compact distance histogram: a novel structure to boost k-nearest neighbor queries,Marcos VN Bedo; Daniel S Kaster; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract The k-Nearest Neighbor query (k-NNq) is one of the most useful similarity queries.Elaborated k-NNq algorithms depend on an initial radius to prune regions of the searchspace that cannot contribute to the answer. Therefore; estimating a suitable starting radius isof major importance to accelerate k-NNq execution. This paper presents a new technique toestimate a tight initial radius. Our approach; named CDH-kNN; relies on Compact DistanceHistograms (CDHs); which are pivot-based histograms defined as piecewise linearfunctions. Such structures approximate the distance distribution and are compressedaccording to a given constraint; which can be a desired number of buckets and/or amaximum allowed error. The covering radius of a k-NNq is estimated based on therelationship between the query element and the CDHs' joint frequencies.

Fire detection from social media images by means of instance-based learning,Marcos Vinicius Naves Bedo; William Dener de Oliveira; Mirela Teixeira Cazzolato; Alceu Ferraz Costa; Gustavo Blanco; Jose F Rodrigues Jr; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract Social media can provide valuable information to support decision making in crisismanagement; such as in accidents; explosions; and fires. However; much of the data fromsocial media are images; which are uploaded at a rate that makes it impossible for humanbeings to analyze them. To cope with that problem; we design and implement a database-driven architecture for fast and accurate fire detection named FFireDt.

Combine-and-conquer: improving the diversity in similarity search through influence sampling,Lucio FD Santos; Willian D Oliveira; Luiz O Carvalho; Monica RP Ferreira; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract Result diversification methods are intended to retrieve elements similar to a givenobject whereas also enforcing a certain degree of diversity among them; aimed at improvingthe answer relevance. Most of the methods are based on optimization; but bearing NP-hardsolutions. Diversity is injected into an otherwise all-too-similar result set in two phases: in thefirst; the search space is reduced to speed up finding the optimal solution; whereas in thesecond a trade-off between diversity and similarity over the reduced space is obtained. It isassumed that the first phase is achieved by applying a traditional nearest neighboralgorithm; but no previous investigation evaluated the impact of the first over the secondphase. In this paper; we devised alternative techniques to execute the first phase andevaluated how obtaining a better quality set of elements in the first phase can improve the …,Proceedings of the 30th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2015,1
Being Similar is Not Enough: How to Bridge Usability Gap through Diversity in Medical Images,Lúcio FD Santos; Marcos VN Bedo; Marcelo Ponciano-Silva; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,In this paper we present a technique developed to bridge the usability gap in Content-BasedMedical Image Retrieval (CBMIR) systems exploring both similarity and diversity. Usabilitygaps are related to how easy to use a software tool from the radiologist's perspective is.Although much have been done to better express similarity queries; the use of CBMIR overmassive databases may have drawbacks that impact its usability. We claim that much of theproblems derives from the fact that many images returned are closer to each other than tothe query element (near-duplicates). To target this nuisance; we propose to boost similarityqueries with diversity; using a technique to hierarchically cluster near-duplicates. Wetailored a domain-independent and parameter-free method by controlling the maximum areareached in the search space.

A region of interest (the mass) isautomatically segmented using an improved algorithm based on EM/MPM and the shape ismodeled into a scale-free complex network. Topological measurements of the resultingnetwork are used to compose the shape descriptors.

Paged similarity queries,Enzo Seraphim; Thatyana F Piola Seraphim; Edmilson M Moreira; Fábio Ricotta; Caetano Traina,Abstract An important feature of a database management systems (DBMS) is its client/serverarchitecture; where managing shared memory among the clients and the server is always antough issue. However; similarity queries are specially sensitive to this kind of architecture;since the answer sizes vary widely. Usually; the answers of similarity query are fullyprocessed to be sent in full to the user; who often is interested in just parts of the answer; egjust few elements closer or farther to the query reference. Compelling the DBMS to retrievethe full answer; further ignoring its majority is at least a waste of server processing power.Paging the answer is a technique that splits the answer onto several pages; following clientrequests. Despite the success of paging on traditional queries; little work has been done tosupport it in similarity queries.

Paginação de resultados em consultas por abrangência,Fábio Ricotta; Thatyana de FP Seraphim; Enzo Seraphim; Edmilson M Moreira; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract An important functionality of the database management systems (DBMS) in theclient/server architecture is the capacity of answer queries of client'applications. In thisarchitecture; it is not always possible to foresee the quantity of results that may be generatedfrom a specific query. So; a query may result in a large amount of records which not alwaysis analyzed by the client; generating a waste of processing. To avoid this waste; thetraditional DBMS use the technique of results pagination; which consists in sending theresults in the proportion when client needs to analyze them. However; the traditional DBMSdo not manipulate data where the similarity is the only relation between the domainelements. For this data domain; there is no support for the results pagination technique anda range query may return a very large list which will not be analyzed by the client.

Distance functions association for content-based image retrieval using multiple comparison criteria,Ives RV Pola; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,The comparison operators available in traditional database management systems (DBMS)are not adequate to handle complex data such as images; rather comparing them usingsimilarity operators is the option of choice. Similarity operators need a way to measure thesimilarity between pairs of objects. Although there are many interesting works dealing withsimilarity queries and functions to measure similarity; they all rely on a single similarityfunction that must be applicable over the whole dataset. However; images from medicalexams often require several ways to measure similarity; depending on many factors; such asthe particular pathological condition being searched; or the existence of specific clinicalcondition revealed in the images compared. Therefore; the ability to handle several ways tocompare images by similarity is important in medical software handling images. This work …,Computer-Based Medical Systems; 2006.

CLAP; ACIR and SCOOP: Novel techniques for improving the performance of dynamic Metric Access Methods,Paulo H Oliveira; Caetano Traina Jr; Daniel S Kaster,Abstract Constant technological advances in electronic devices have led to the growth ofelaborated data such as large texts; time series; georeferenced imagery; genetic sequences;photos; videos and several other types of complex data. Differently from scalar; traditionaldata types such as numbers and strings; complex data do not present the order relationproperty; which allows identifying whether an element precedes another according to somecriterion. Therefore; these data are usually compared by the similarity degree among them.The Metric Access Methods (MAMs) are recognized as well-suited to perform similarityqueries over such kind of data more efficiently than other access methods. MAMs can beconsidered dynamic or static depending on the pivot type used to construct them. Pivots areoften employed to narrow the search for data.

Semantic Similarity Group By Operators for Metric Data,Natan A Laverde; Mirela T Cazzolato; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,Abstract Grouping operators summarize data in DBMS arranging elements in groups usingidentity comparisons. However; for metric data; grouping by identity is seldom useful; sinceadopting the concept of similarity is often a better fit. There are operators that can group dataelements using similarity. However; the existing operators do not achieve good results forcertain data domains or distributions. The major contributions of this work are a noveloperator called the SGB-Vote that assign groups using an election involving alreadyassigned groups and an extension for current operators bounds each group to a maximumamount of the nearest neighbors. The operators were implemented in a framework andevaluated using real and synthetic datasets from diverse domains considering both qualityof and execution time.

The Merkurion approach for similarity searching optimization in Database Management Systems,Marcos VN Bedo; Daniel S Kaster; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract Modern Database Management Systems (DBMSs) retrieve songs that resemblethose in a music dataset; identify plagiarism in a set of documents; or provide past cases tophysicians by taking into account the characteristics of a query exam. All such tasks requirethe comparison of data by similarity; which can be expressed in terms of distance-basedqueries in metric spaces. Traditional query processing relies mostly on histograms fordescribing the data distribution space and choosing a data retrieval path that quickly leadsto the answer; discarding comparisons of most unwanted data. However; DBMSs still lackadequate support for selectivity estimation of query operators for data types embedded inmetric spaces. This article addresses a novel strategy that extends the query optimizer of aDBMS; so that it can also perform both logical and physical query plan optimizations in …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2017,*
How to speed up outliers removal in image matching,Jonathan S Ramos; Carolina YV Watanabe; Caetano Traina Jr; Agma JM Traina,Abstract Outliers removal from matched points is a crucial step in imagematching/mosaicing. A single outlier might lead to incorrect adjustments. In order to dealwith this issue; graph-based approaches were proposed in the literature; but usually theyare very time consuming. Aimed at minimizing the processing time and keeping thematching accuracy; we developed a preprocessing technique called FOMP; which reducesthe number of outliers in the initial set of matched points. FOMP filters out vertices based onthe difference of the edge weights. In this paper; we detail and present an improved version(FOMP*) by enhancing the stop criteria; taking into account the average weights of thevertices. We have conducted exhaustive experiments and summarized the results obtainedover 5 different image datasets; where four of them present several conditions (camera …,Pattern Recognition Letters,2017,*
When Similarity is Not Enough; Ask for Diversity: Grouping Elements Based on Influence,Lucio FD Santos; Luiz Olmes Carvalho; Marcos VN Bedo; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina,Crowdsourcing images have been increasingly employed for mapping emergencyscenarios; which helps rescue forces in choosing contingency plans. In this scenario;similarity searching can be used to retrieve related images from past situations. However;the retrieved images often are similar among themselves and; therefore; add little to nonenew information to the rescue decision-making process. In this paper; we take advantage ofdiversity queries to increase the variety of the representative elements about an incident;whereas the remaining and related data are grouped according to the set of representatives.Thus; our approach enables content retrieval; grouping and an easier exploration of theresult set.

Pivot-Based Similarity Wide-Joins Fostering Near-Duplicate Detection,Luiz Olmes Carvalho; Lucio Fernandes Dutra Santos; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Caetano Traina,Abstract Monitoring systems targeting to improve decision making in emergency scenariosare currently benefiting from crowdsourcing information. The main issue with such kind ofdata is that the gathered reports quickly become too similar among themselves. Hence; toomuch similar reports; namely near-duplicates; do not add valuable knowledge to assist crisiscontrol committees in their decision making tasks. The current approaches to detect near-duplicates are usually based on a twofold processing; where the first phase relies onsimilarity queries or clustering techniques; whereas the second and most computationallycostly phase refines the result from the first one. Aimed at reducing that cost and alsoimproving the ability of near-duplication detection; we developed a framework model basedon the similarity wide-join database operator.

Fire Detection from Social Media Images by Means of Instance-Based Learning,Mirela Teixeira Cazzolato; Alceu Ferraz Costa; Gustavo Blanco; Jose F Rodrigues Jr; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract. Social media can provide valuable information to support decision making in crisismanagement; such as in accidents; explosions; and fires. However; much of the data fromsocial media are images; which are uploaded at a rate that makes it impossible for humanbeings to analyze them. To cope with that problem; we design and implement a database-driven architecture for fast and accurate fire detection named FFireDt. The design of FFireDtuses the instance-based learning through indexed similarity queries expressed as anextension of the relational Structured Query Language. Our contributions are:(i) the designof the Fast-Fire Detection (FFireDt); which achieves efficiency and efficacy rates that rival tothe state-of-the-art techniques;(ii) the sound evaluation of 36 image descriptors; for the taskof image classification in social media;(iii) the evaluation of content-based indexing with …,Enterprise Information Systems: 17th International Conference; ICEIS 2015; Barcelona; Spain; April 27-30; 2015; Revised Selected Papers,2016,*

Complex data whose primary comparison mechanisms aresimilarity predicates are usually immersed in metric spaces. Metric Access Methods (MAMs)exploit the metric space properties to divide the metric space into regions and conquerefficiency on the processing of similarity queries; like range and k-nearest neighbor queries.Existing MAM use homogeneous data structures to improve query execution; pursuing thesame techniques employed by traditional methods developed to retrieve scalar andmultidimensional data.

However; the integration of both query operator classes is still in its early stages; asmost works on similarity queries focus on the data structures and operations required toexecute just the similarity retrieval operation; but few of them target problems on theintegration itself. Among them; the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) comparison operator givesground to conflicting interpretations when composed with others.

MFS-Map: efficient context and content combination to annotate images,Alceu Ferraz Costa; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract Automatic image annotation provides textual description to images based oncontent and context information. Since images may present large variability; imageannotation methods often employ multiple extractors to represent visual content consideringlocal and global features under different visual aspects. As result; an important aspect ofimage annotation is the combination of context and content representations. This paperproposes MFS-Map (Multi-Feature Space Map); a novel image annotation method thatmanages the problem of combining multiple content and context representations whenannotating images. The advantage of MFS-Map is that it does not represent visual andtextual features by a single large feature vector. Rather; MFS-Map divides the problem intofeature subspaces.

Toward developing facilities for such integration; we developed a technique toextract a canonical queryplan command tree from an similarity-extended SQL expression.The SHRuB tool; presented in this paper; is able to interactively represent a query parsetree.We developed a catalog model which allows estimating the execution cost as well asprovides hints for optimizing the query-plan by adopting a three stage heuristic. Through acase study and initial experiments; we have demonstrated that the tool is able to find a local-minimum query-execution plan.

RDBMS as an Efficient Tool to Mine Cliques on Complex Networks,Ana Paula Appel; Adriano Arantes Paterlini; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract. Complex networks are intrinsically present in a wide range of applications. Realworld networks have several unique properties; such as; sparsity; node degree distribution;which follow a power law and a large amount of triangles that further form larger cliques.Triangles and cluster coefficient; which are usually used to find groups; are not alwaysenough to distinguish a different node neighborhood topology. By using cliques of sizes 4and 5; it is possible to study how triangles become involved to form large cliques. To retrievethese cliques called κ4 and κ5 a novel technique called “FCR-Fast Clique Retrieval” hasbeen developed; taking advantage of the data management and optimization techniques ofa relational database management system and SQL to query cliques of sizes 4 and 5.

Properties of the Unary Similarity Operator Integrated to the Relational Algebra,Mônica Ribeiro Porto Ferreira; Caetano Traina Junior; Agma Juci Machado Traina; Ires Dias,Abstract.

Neither of them are appropriate to managecomplex data; such as multimedia data (eg; images; audio and large texts); time series andgenetic sequences. In fact; the most meaningful way to compare complex data is bysimilarity. However; the Relational Algebra; employed in the relational DatabaseManagement Systems (RDBMS); cannot express similarity criteria. In order to address thissupport; an extension to the Relational Algebra is under development at GBdI-ICMCUSP(Databases and Images Group); aiming to represent similarity queries in algebraicexpressions.

Content-Based Retrieval of Musical Scores in an Object-oriented Database System,Marisa Beck Figueiredo; Caetano Traina Júnior; Agma J Machado Traina,Abstract: The aim of this work is to present the Musical Score as a new attributecharacteristic in an object-oriented database. It defines a new data type for attributes thatcan be associated to objects using the MIDI Standard; the Standard MIDI File format; and theGeneral MIDI standards. To offer complete database support to musical scores as a datatype; it is necessary to provide storage; manipulation; search and retrieval methods. Thiswork uses the inner structure of Musical Scores; following the MIDI standard; to enable thecreation of index mechanisms in the database; allowing for the retrieval of musical scoresbased on their contents.,IADT,1998,*

MAMMOSET: An Enhanced Dataset of Mammograms,Paulo H Oliveira; Lucas C Scabora; Mirela T Cazzolato; Marcos VN Bedo; Agma JM Traina; Caetano Traina-Jr,Abstract. In this paper; we present MAMMOSET; a compilation of datasets consisting ofregions of interest (ROIs) of mammograms. MAMMOSET is composed of data collected fromthree diversified sources; namely DDSM; MINI-MIAS; and VIENNA. Accordingly; the imagesof MAMMOSET were obtained from distinct medical scanners and annotated in differentmanners. Our contribution refers to the standardization of the collected images; as well asthe organization of the metadata. Additionally; we generate a high-dimensional datarepresentation; which is a composition of features extracted by nine image processingextractors to represent color; texture; and shape. Finally; we provide a detailed description ofthe organized metadata and extracted features; as well as a discussion on the PrincipalComponent Analysis (PCA). MAMMOSET can be employed in several supervised and …,*,*,*

Data related to agrometeorology have increased fast and continuously. These dataare important to propose innovative and technologically feasible solutions to assist in cropsmonitoring and forecasting in Brazil. In particular; harvest forecasting such as sugar-canecrops that are used to biofuel production. These crops have a strategic significance to thecountry economy. Therefore; some questions are still opened. How to identify meaningfulpatterns in the datasets? How can we explore these data to improve the production estimateof agricultural crops? Aimed at answering these questions; this work proposes a techniquethat applies the Fractal theory to determine groups of correlated attributes and associationrule mining to identify patterns in the data.

iDFQL-Uma Ferramenta de Apoio ao Processo de Ensino-Aprendizagem da Álgebra Relacional Baseado no Construcionismo,Caetano Traina Jr; Ana Paula Appel,The teaching relacional algebra in database course has many problems. A major problem isthe inexistence of computational tools to support the drilling of relational algebra leadteachers to make brief lectures about it; reducing the perception of its importance betweenthe students. This paper presents a constructionism-query-based tool–iDFQL (InteractiveData Flow Query Language)–to support the teaching-learning of relational algebra by usingthe flow diagram approach. The iDFQL tool allows students to build and execute relationalalgebra queries using graphical elements interactively; making learning relational algebraconcepts easier to students.

GMine: interactive browsing of large graphs,Jose Fernando Rodrigues Jr; Caio César Mori Carélo; Agma JM Traina; Cristina DA Ciferri; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract  Graphs are abstract representations that can describe a large set of real worldphenomena and that; possibly; scale to the order of hundreds of thousands of nodes andmillions of edges. Benefiting from such graphs can be better performed by means of visualinteraction. However; in the domain of large graphs; excessive processing and limiteddisplay space bound the possibilities for visual presentation and processing. In this line; weintroduce GMine; a prototype system that uses an innovative data structure; the Graph-Tree.The engineering of GMine allows for scalability over huge graphs stored on disk; anextended graph representation embracing both hierarchical and plain organization; and theinteractive browsing of graph hierarchies.

O SPI deve prover um conjunto de funções eoperadores sobre imagens que extraem suas características; as quais são armazenadas nabase de imagens e gerenciadas pelo SGBD utilizando suas características para indexá-lase agilizar sua recuperação posterior. Assim; o sistema baseia-se no conceito de busca deimagens através de conteúdo e não em textos associados às mesmas.
