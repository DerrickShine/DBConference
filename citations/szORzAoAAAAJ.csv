Query containment and rewriting using views for regular path queries under constraints,Gösta Grahne; Alex Thomo,Abstract In this paper we consider general path constraints for semistructured databases.Our general constraints do not suffer from the limitations of the path constraints previouslystudied in the literature. We investigate the containment of regular path queries undergeneral path constraints. We show that when the path constraints and queries areexpressed by words; as opposed to languages; the containment problem becomesequivalent to the word rewrite problem for a corresponding semi-Thue system.Consequently; if the corresponding semi-Thue system has an undecidable word problem;the word query containment problem will be undecidable too. Also; we show that there areword constraints; where the corresponding semi-Thue system has a decidable word rewriteproblem; but the general query containment under these word constraints is undecidable …,Proceedings of the twenty-second ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2003,53

Trust prediction from user-item ratings,Nikolay Korovaiko; Alex Thomo,Abstract Trust relationships between users in various online communities are notoriouslyhard to model for computer scientists. It can be easily verified that trying to infer trust basedon the social network alone is often inefficient. Therefore; the avenue we explore is applyingData Mining algorithms to unearth latent relationships and patterns from background data. Inthis paper; we focus on a case where the background data are user ratings for onlineproduct reviews. We consider as a testing ground a large dataset provided by Epinions. comthat contains a trust network as well as user ratings for reviews on products from a widerange of categories. In order to predict trust we define and compute a critical set of features;which we show to be highly effective in providing the basis for trust predictions. Then; weshow that state-of-the-art classifiers can do an impressive job in predicting trust based on …,Social Network Analysis and Mining,2013,31
K-core decomposition of large networks on a single PC,Wissam Khaouid; Marina Barsky; Venkatesh Srinivasan; Alex Thomo,Abstract Studying the topology of a network is critical to inferring underlying dynamics suchas tolerance to failure; group behavior and spreading patterns. k-core decomposition is awell-established metric which partitions a graph into layers from external to more centralvertices. In this paper we aim to explore whether k-core decomposition of large networks canbe computed using a consumer-grade PC. We feature implementations of the" vertex-centric" distributed protocol introduced by Montresor; De Pellegrini and Miorandi onGraphChi and Webgraph. Also; we present an accurate implementation of the Batagelj andZaversnik algorithm for k-core decomposition in Webgraph. With our implementations; weshow that we can efficiently handle networks of billions of edges using a single consumer-level machine within reasonable time and can produce excellent approximations in only a …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,30
Why Waldo befriended the dummy? k-Anonymization of social networks with pseudo-nodes,Sean Chester; Bruce M Kapron; Ganesh Ramesh; Gautam Srivastava; Alex Thomo; S Venkatesh,Abstract For a graph-based representation of a social network; the identity of participantscan be uniquely determined if an adversary has background structural knowledge about thegraph. We focus on degree-based attacks; wherein the adversary knows the degrees ofparticular target vertices and we aim to protect the anonymity of participants through k-anonymization; which ensures that every participant is equivalent to at least k− 1 otherparticipants with respect to degree. We introduce a natural and novel approach ofintroducing “dummy” participants into the network and linking them to each other and to realparticipants in order to achieve this anonymity. The advantage of our approach lies in thenature of the results that we derive. We show that if participants have labels associated withthem; the problem of anonymizing a subset of participants is NP-Complete. On the other …,Social Network Analysis and Mining,2013,30
Suffix trees for very large genomic sequences,Marina Barsky; Ulrike Stege; Alex Thomo; Chris Upton,Abstract A suffix tree is a fundamental data structure for string searching algorithms.Unfortunately; when it comes to the use of suffix trees in real-life applications; the currentmethods for constructing suffix trees do not scale for large inputs. All the existing practicalalgorithms perform random access to the input string; thus requiring that the input be smallenough to be kept in main memory. We are the first to present an algorithm which is able toconstruct suffix trees for input sequences significantly larger than the size of the availablemain memory. As a proof of concept; we show that our method allows to build the suffix treefor 12GB of real DNA sequences in 26 hours on a single machine with 2GB of RAM. Thisinput is four times the size of the Human Genome; and the construction of suffix trees forinputs of such magnitude was never reported before.,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,30
Visibly pushdown transducers for approximate validation of streaming XML,Alex Thomo; Srinivasan Venkatesh; Ying Ying Ye,Abstract Visibly Pushdown Languages (VPLs); recognized by Visibly Pushdown Automata(VPAs); are a nicely behaved family of context-free languages. It has been shown that VPAsare equivalent to Extended Document Type Definitions (EDTDs); and thus; they providemeans for elegantly solving various problems on XML. Especially; it has been shown thatVPAs are the apt device for streaming XML. One of the important problems about XML thatcan be addressed using VPAs is the validation problem in which we need to decide whetheran XML document conforms to the specification given by an EDTD. In this paper; we areinterested in solving the approximate version of this problem; which is to decide whether anXML document can be modified by a tolerable number of edit operations to yield a valid onewith respect to a given EDTD. For this; we define Visibly Pushdown Transducers (VPTs) …,International Symposium on Foundations of Information and Knowledge Systems,2008,30
A new method for indexing genomes using on-disk suffix trees,Marina Barsky; Ulrike Stege; Alex Thomo; Chris Upton,Abstract We propose a new method to build persistent suffix trees for indexing the genomicdata. Our algorithm DiGeST (Disk-Based Genomic Suffix Tree) improves significantly overprevious work in reducing the random access to the input string and performing only twopasses over disk data. DiGeST is based on the two-phase multi-way merge sort paradigmusing a concise binary representation of the DNA alphabet. Furthermore; our method scalesto larger genomic data than managed before.,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,29
Distributed evaluation of generalized path queries,Dan C Stefanescu; Alex Thomo; Lida Thomo,Abstract Nowadays; we are required to deal with more complex data; prime examples ofwhich are data on the Web; XML data; biological data; etc. There are already proposedabstractions to handle these kinds of data; in particular in terms of semistructured datamodels. A semistructured model conceives a database essentially as a finite directedlabeled graph whose nodes represent objects; and whose edges represent relationshipsbetween objects. In this paper; we focus on path queries; which are considered the basicquerying mechanism for semistructured data. In essence; such queries are used to navigate;or discover paths that conform to specifications captured by regular expressions. In order tomake the navigation more useful; we consider generalized path queries; in which thesymbols could optionally be weighted by numbers. Such numbers can express a variety …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2005,27
Trust-Based Infinitesimals for Enhanced Collaborative Filtering.,Maria Chowdhury; Alex Thomo; William W Wadge,Abstract In this paper we propose a novel recommender system which enhances user-based collaborative filtering by using a trust-based social network. Our main idea is to useinfinitesimal numbers and polynomials for capturing natural preferences in aggregatingopinions of trusted users. We use these opinions to “help” users who are similar to an activeuser to come up with recommendations for items for which they might not have an opinionthemselves. We argue that the method we propose reflects better the real life behaviour ofthe people. Our method is justified by the experimental results; we are the first to break astated “barrier” of 0.73 for the mean absolute error (MAE) of the predicted ratings. Our resultsare based on a large; real life dataset from Epinions. com; for which; we also achieve aprediction coverage that is significantly better than that of the state-of-the-art methods.,COMAD,2009,26
Smarterdeals: a context-aware deal recommendation system based on the smartercontext engine,Sahar Ebrahimi; Norha M Villegas; Hausi A Müller; Alex Thomo,Abstract Daily-deal applications are popular implementations of on-line advertisingstrategies that offer products and services to users based on their personal profiles. Thecurrent implementations are effective but can frustrate users with irrelevant deals due tostale profiles. To exploit these applications fully; deals must become smarter and context-aware. This paper presents SmarterDeals; our deal recommendation system that exploitsusers' changing personal context information to deliver highly relevant offers. SmarterDealsrelies on recommendation algorithms based on collaborative filtering; and SmarterContext;our adaptive context management framework. SmarterContext provides SmarterDeals withup-to-date information about users' locations and product preferences gathered from theirpast and present web interactions.

Fault-tolerant computation of distributed regular path queries,Maryam Shoaran; Alex Thomo,Abstract Regular path queries are the building blocks of almost any mechanism for queryingsemistructured data. Despite the fact that the main applications of such data are distributed;there are only few works dealing with distributed evaluation of regular path queries. In thispaper we present a message-efficient and truly distributed algorithm for computing theanswer to regular path queries in a multi-source semistructured database setting. Ouralgorithm is general as it works for the larger class of weighted regular path queries onweighted semistructured databases. Also; we show how to make our algorithm fault-tolerantto smoothly work in environments prone to process (or machine) failures. This is verydesirable in a grid setting; which is today's new paradigm of distributed computing; andwhere one does not have full control over machines that can unexpectedly leave in the …,Theoretical Computer Science,2009,25
Preferentially annotated regular path queries,Gösta Grahne; Alex Thomo; William Wadge,Abstract In this paper; we introduce preferential regular path queries. These are regular pathqueries whose symbols are annotated with preference weights for “scaling” up or down theintrinsic importance of matching a symbol against a (semistructured) database edge label.Annotated regular path queries are expressed syntactically as annotated regularexpressions. We interpret these expressions in a uniform semiring framework; which allowsdifferent semantics specializations for the same syntactic annotations. For our preferencequeries; we study three important aspects:(1)(progressive) query answering (2)(certain)query answering in LAV data-integration systems; and (3) query containment andequivalence. In all of these; we obtain important positive results; which encourage the use ofour preference framework for enhanced querying of semistructured databases.,International Conference on Database Theory,2007,24
Regular path queries under approximate semantics,Gösta Grahne; Alex Thomo,We give a general framework for approximate query processing in semistructureddatabases. We focus on regular path queries; which are the integral part of most of the querylanguages for semistructured databases. To enable approximations; we allow the regularpath queries to be distorted. The distortions are expressed in the system by using weightedregular expressions; which correspond to weighted regular transducers. After defining thenotion of weighted approximate answers we show how to compute them in order of theirproximity to the query. In the new approximate setting; query containment has to beredefined in order to take into account the quantitative proximity information in the queryanswers. For this; we define the approximate containment; and its variants k-containmentand reliable contain-ment.

Link recommender: Collaborative-Filtering for recommending URLS to Twitter users,Nazpar Yazdanfar; Alex Thomo,Abstract Twitter; the popular micro-blogging service; has gained a rapid growth in recentyears. Newest information is accessible in this social web service through a large volume ofreal-time tweets. Tweets are short and they are more informative when they are coupled withURLs. Due to tweet overload in Twitter; we believe that an accurate URL recommendersystem is a beneficial tool for information seekers. In this paper; we focus on a neighborhood-based recommender system that recommends URLs to Twitter users. We consider one ofthe major elements of tweets; hashtags; as topic representatives of URLs in our approach.We propose methods for incorporating hashtags in measuring the relevancy of URLs. Ourexperiments show that our neighborhood-based recommender system outperforms thematrix factorization-based system significantly. We also show that the accuracy of URL …,Procedia Computer Science,2013,23

k-Anonymization of Social Networks by Vertex Addition.,Sean Chester; Bruce Kapron; Ganesh Ramesh; Gautam Srivastava; Alex Thomo; S Venkatesh,Abstract. With an abundance of social network data being released; the need to protectsensitive information within these networks has become an important concern of datapublishers. In this paper we focus on the popular notion of kanonymization as applied tonode degrees in a social network. Given such a network N; the problem we study is totransform N to N; such that the degree of each node in N is attained by at least k− 1 othernodes in N. Apart from previous work; we permit modifications to the node set; rather thanthe edge set; and this offers unique advantages with respect to the utility of the releasedanonymized network. We study both vertex-labeled and unlabeled graphs; since instancesof each occur in real-world social networks. Under the constraint of minimum node additions;we show that on vertex-labeled graphs; the problem is NP-complete. For unlabeled …,ADBIS (2),2011,21

Computing k-regret minimizing sets,Sean Chester; Alex Thomo; S Venkatesh; Sue Whitesides,Abstract Regret minimizing sets are a recent approach to representing a dataset D by asmall subset R of size r of representative data points. The set R is chosen such thatexecuting any top-1 query on R rather than D is minimally perceptible to any user. However;such a subset R may not exist; even for modest sizes; r. In this paper; we introduce therelaxation to k-regret minimizing sets; whereby a top-1 query on R returns a resultimperceptibly close to the top-k on D. We show that; in general; with or without therelaxation; this problem is NP-hard. For the specific case of two dimensions; we give anefficient dynamic programming; plane sweep algorithm based on geometric duality to find anoptimal solution. For arbitrary dimension; we give an empirically effective; greedy;randomized algorithm based on linear programming. With these algorithms; we can find …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,19

Our proposed framework groups thenodes and edges of the graph based on a user selected set of node attributes. We presentmethods to compute useful graph aggregates without the need to create all of the possiblegraph-instances of the original probabilistic graph. Also; we present an algorithm for graphsummarization based on pure relational (SQL) technology. We analyze our algorithm andpractically evaluate its scalability using an extended Epinions dataset as well as syntheticdatasets. The experimental results show that our algorithm produces compressed summarygraphs in reasonable time.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2013,17

Towards this problem; we introduce the first query-agnostic approach; which leads to an efficient index.

Efficient computation of feedback arc set at web-scale,Michael Simpson; Venkatesh Srinivasan; Alex Thomo,Abstract The minimum feedback arc set problem is an NP-hard problem on graphs thatseeks a minimum set of arcs which; when removed from the graph; leave it acyclic.

Zero-knowledge private graph summarization,Maryam Shoaran; Alex Thomo; Jens H Weber-Jahnke,Graphs have become increasingly popular for modeling data in a wide variety ofapplications; and graph summarization is a useful technique to analyze information fromlarge graphs. Privacy preserving mechanisms are vital to protect the privacy of individuals orinstitutions when releasing aggregate numbers; such as those in graph summarization. Wepropose privacy-aware release of graph summarization using zero-knowledge privacy(ZKP); a recently proposed privacy framework that is more effective than differential privacy(DP) for graph and social network databases. We first define group-based graph summaries.Next; we present techniques to compute the parameters required to design ZKP methods foreach type of aggregate data. Then; we present an approach to achieve ZKP for probabilisticgraphs.,Big Data; 2013 IEEE International Conference on,2013,13
Suffix trees for inputs larger than main memory,Marina Barsky; Ulrike Stege; Alex Thomo,Abstract A suffix tree is a fundamental data structure for string searching algorithms.Unfortunately; when it comes to the use of suffix trees in real-life applications; the currentmethods for constructing suffix trees do not scale for large inputs.

ACon: A learning-based approach to deal with uncertainty in contextual requirements at runtime,Alessia Knauss; Daniela Damian; Xavier Franch; Angela Rook; Hausi A Müller; Alex Thomo,Abstract Context: Runtime uncertainty such as unpredictable operational environment andfailure of sensors that gather environmental data is a well-known challenge for adaptivesystems. Objective: To execute requirements that depend on context correctly; the systemneeds up-to-date knowledge about the context relevant to such requirements.

Rewriting of visibly pushdown languages for XML data integration,Alex Thomo; Srinivasan Venkatesh,Abstract In this work; we focus on XML data integration by studying rewritings of XML targetschemas in terms of source schemas. Rewriting is very important in data integration systemswhere the system is asked to find and assemble XML documents from the data sources andproduce documents that satisfy a target schema. As schema representation; we considerVisibly Pushdown Automata (VPAs); which accept Visibly Pushdown Languages (VPLs).The latter have been shown to coincide with the family of (word-encoded) regular treelanguages; which are the basis of formalisms for specifying XML schemas. Furthermore;practical semi-formal XML schema specifications (defined by simple pattern conditions onXML) compile into VPAs that are exponentially more concise than other representationsbased on tree automata. Notably; VPLs enjoy a “well-behavedness” that facilitates us in …,Theoretical Computer Science,2011,12
Harnessing the power of favorites lists for recommendation systems,Maryam Khezrzadeh; Alex Thomo; William W Wadge,Abstract We propose a novel collaborative recommendation approach to take advantage ofthe information available in user-created lists. Our approach assumes associations amongany two items appearing in a list together. We calculate sum of Bayesian ratings (SBR) of alllists containing an item pair as the strength of item-item associations in that pair. SBR takesinto consideration not only the number of lists the items have co-appeared in; but also thequality of the lists. We collected a data set of user ratings for books along with Listmania listson Amazon. com using Amazon Web Services (AWS). Our method shows superiorperformance to existing user-based and item-based collaborative filtering approachesaccording to the resulted MAE; coverage and F-measure.,Proceedings of the third ACM conference on Recommender systems,2009,11

The problem can besummarized as constructing a search strategy that will leave the graph clear of anycontamination at the end of the searching process in as few steps as possible. We show thatthis problem is NP-hard even on directed acyclic graphs and provide an efficientapproximation algorithm.

Our goal is to provide a framework forefficient validation of streaming XML in the realistic setting where the schemas of theexchanging parties evolve and thus diverge from one another. We show that VisiblyPushdown Languages are closed under the defined language operators and this enablesus to expand the schemas (for XML) in order to account for flexible or constrained evolution.,Theoretical Computer Science,2011,10
Grid-aware evaluation of regular path queries on spatial networks,Zhuo Miao; Dan Stefanescu; Alex Thomo,Regular path queries (RPQs); expressed as regular expressions over the alphabet ofdatabase edge-labels; are commonly used for guided navigation of graph databases. Whileconvenient to use; RPQs are notorious for their high computational demand. In this paper;we present a grid-aware; fault tolerant distributed algorithm for answering RPQs on spatialnetworks. We engineer each part of the algorithm to account for the assumed computational-grid setting. We experimentally evaluate our algorithm; and show that for typical userqueries; our algorithm satisfies the desiderata for distributed computing in general; andcomputational-grids in particular.,Advanced Information Networking and Applications; 2007.

New rewritings and optimizations for regular path queries,Gösta Grahne; Alex Thomo,Abstract All the languages for querying semistructured data and the web use as an integralpart regular expressions. Based on practical observations; finding the paths that satisfythose regular expressions is very expensive. In this paper; we introduce the “maximal partialrewritings”(MPR's) for regular path queries using views. The MPR's are always exact andmore useful for the optimization of the regular path queries than other rewritings frompreviously known methods. We develop an algorithm for computing MPR's and prove;through a complexity theoretic analysis; that our algorithm is essentially optimal. Also; wepresent query answering algorithms that utilize exact partial rewritings for regular pathqueries and conjunctive regular path queries respectively.,International Conference on Database Theory,2003,10
Efficient computation of importance based communities in web-scale networks using a single machine,Shu Chen; Ran Wei; Diana Popova; Alex Thomo,Abstract Finding decompositions of a graph into a family of communities is crucial tounderstanding its underlying structure. Algorithms for finding communities in networks oftenrely only on structural information and search for cohesive subsets of nodes. In practicehowever; we would like to find communities that are not only cohesive; but also influential orimportant. In order to capture such communities; Li; Qin; Yu; and Mao introduced a novelcommunity model called" k-influential community" based on the concept of $ k $-core; withnumerical values representing" influence" assigned to the nodes. They formulate theproblem of finding the top-r most important communities as finding r connected k-coresubgraphs ordered by the lower-bound of their importance. In this paper; our goal is to scale-up the computation of top-r; k-core communities to web-scale graphs of tens of billions of …,Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2016,9
Indexing for vector projections,Sean Chester; Alex Thomo; Srinivasan Venkatesh; Sue Whitesides,Abstract The ability to extract the most relevant information from a dataset is paramountwhen the dataset is large. For data arising from a numeric domain; a pervasive means ofmodelling the data is to represent it in the form of vectors. This enables a range of geometrictechniques; this paper introduces projection as a natural and powerful means of scoring therelevancy of vectors. As yet; there are no effective indexing techniques for quickly retrievingthose vectors in a dataset that have large projections onto a query vector. We address thatgap by introducing the first indexing algorithms for vectors of arbitrary dimension; producingindices with strong sub-linear and output-sensitive worst-case query cost and linear datastructure size guarantees in the I/O cost model. We improve this query cost markedly for thespecial case of two dimensions. The derivation of these algorithms results from the novel …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2011,9
Scalable apriori-based frequent pattern discovery,Sean Chester; Ian Sandler; Alex Thomo,Frequent pattern discovery; the task of finding sets of items that frequently occur together in adataset; has beenat the core of the field of data mining for the past sixteen years. In that time;the size of datasets has grown much faster than has the ability of existing algorithms tohandle those datasets. Consequently; improvements are needed. In this paper we take theclassic algorithm for the problem; A Priori; and by adding a vertical sort drastically improveits performance characteristics when processing very large datasets. We use the benchmarklarge dataset webdocs from the FIMI 2004 conference to contrast our performance againstseveral state-of-the-art implementations and demonstrate both equal efficiency with lowermemory usage at all support thresholds and also the ability to mine support thresholds asyet unattempted in literature.

Conflict-aware weighted bipartite b-matching and its application to e-commerce,Cheng Chen; Lan Zheng; Venkatesh Srinivasan; Alex Thomo; Kui Wu; Anthony Sukow,The weighted bipartite b-matching problem (WBM) plays a significant role in many real-world applications; including resource allocation; scheduling; Internet advertising; and E-commerce. WBM has been widely studied and efficient matching algorithms are well known.In this work; we study a novel variant of WBM; called conflict-aware WBM (CA-WBM); whereconflict constraints are present between vertices of the bipartite graph. In CA-WBM; if twovertices (on the same side) are in conflict; they may not be included in the matching resultsimultaneously. We present a generalized formulation of CA-WBM in the context of E-commerce; where diverse matching results are often desired (eg; movies of different genresand merchants selling products of different categories). While WBM is efficiently solvable inpolynomial-time; we show that CA-WBM is NP-hard. We propose approximate and …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,8
How do biological networks differ from social networks?(an experimental study),Tatiana Gutiérrez-Bunster; Ulrike Stege; Alex Thomo; John Taylor,In this paper we outline important differences between (1) protein interaction networks and(2) social and other complex networks; in terms of fine-grained network community profiles.While these families of networks present some general similarities; they also have somestark differences in the way the communities are formed. Namely; we find that the sizes ofthe best communities in such biological networks are an order of magnitude smaller than insocial and other complex networks. We furthermore find that the generative modeldescribing biological networks is very different from the model describing social networks.While for latter the Forest-Fire model best approximates their network community profile; forbiological networks it is a random rewiring model that generates networks with the observedprofiles. Our study suggests that these families of networks should be treated differently …,Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM); 2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on,2014,8
Preferential infinitesimals for information retrieval,Maria Chowdhury; Alex Thomo; William W Wadge,Abstract In this paper; we propose a preference framework for information retrieval in whichthe user and the system administrator are enabled to express preference annotations onsearch keywords and document elements; respectively. Our framework is flexible and allowsexpressing preferences such as “A is infinitely more preferred than B;” which we capture byusing hyperreal numbers. Due to the widespread of XML as a standard for representingdocuments; we consider XML documents in this paper and propose a consistent preferentialweighting scheme for nested document elements. We show how to naturally incorporatepreferences on search keywords and document elements into an IR ranking process usingthe well-known TF-IDF ranking measure.,IFIP International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,2009,8

Preferential regular path queries,Gösta Grahne; Alex Thomo; William W Wadge,Abstract In this paper; we introduce preferential regular path queries. These are regular pathqueries whose symbols are annotated with preference weights for" scaling" up or down theintrinsic importance of matching a symbol against a (semistructured) database edge label.Annotated regular path queries are expressed syntactically as annotated regularexpressions. We interpret these expressions in a uniform semiring framework; which allowsdifferent semantic interpretations for the same syntactic annotations. For our preferencequeries; we study three important aspects:(1)(progressive) query answering (2)(certain)query answering in LAV data-integration systems; and (3) query containment andequivalence. In all of these; we obtain important positive results; which encourage the use ofour preference framework for enhanced querying of semistructured databases.,Fundamenta Informaticae,2008,7
Optimized block based disparity estimation in stereo systems using a maximum-flow approach,IMIR Thomo; SOTIRIS Malasiotis; MICHAEL G Strintzis,A novel disparity estimation method is presented that increases the robustness of theestimator by replacing the classical approach of dynamic programming with finding themaximum flow in a graph. Once solved; the minimum cut associated to the maximum flowyields a disparity surface for the whole image at once. The results show improved depthestimations as well as better handling of depth discontinuities. Although the running time forsolving the maximum flow problem is higher than dynamic programming; experiments haveshown that the special topology of the graph; the position of the source and sink and thecapacity structure of the edges tend to make the problem easier to solve. However; the maindrawback of this approach is the large amount of memory resources required by theclassical implementations of the maximum flow algorithm; which make impossible in …,Computer Graphics; Image Processing; and Vision; 1998.

A model for learning the news in social networks,Krishnan Rajagopalan; Venkatesh Srinivasan; Alex Thomo,Abstract In social media such as Facebook; the most popular desire is to learn the newsabout other people. In this paper; we study the following problem related to informationpropagation: Suppose that there is a set U of N users in a social network. They meet onlinefrom time to time and share information they know about themselves and the other users inthe network. Whenever a group g⊂ U of users meet; they want to know who has the latestinformation about every user in U. A naive solution to this problem is to use timestamps.However; there are drawbacks to this scheme including the burden on the users to maintainreliable timestamps and the fact that the timestamps grow unbounded over time. It is naturalto ask if it is possible to learn the latest information without using timestamps. We present anefficient method which removes the need to timestamp user information (news). Instead …,Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence,2015,6
Comparing the staples in latent factor models for recommender systems,Cheng Chen; Lan Zheng; Alex Thomo; Kui Wu; Venkatesh Srinivasan,Abstract Since the Netflix Prize competition; latent factor models (LFMs) have become thecomparison" staples" for many of the recent recommender methods. The performanceimprovement of LFMs over baseline approaches; however; hovers at only low percentagenumbers. Therefore; it is time for a better understanding of their real power beyond theoverall RMSE (root-mean-square error); which as it happens; lies at a very compressedrange; without providing too much chance for deeper insight. This paper provides a detailedexperimental study regarding the performance of classical staple LFMs on a classicaldataset; Movielens 1M 1; that sheds light on a much more pronounced excellence of LFMsfor particular categories of users and items; for RMSE and other measures. In particular;LFMs exhibit surprising and excellent advantages when handling several difficult user …,Proceedings of the 29th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2014,6
Differential privacy in practice,Maryam Shoaran; Alex Thomo; Jens Weber,Abstract Differential privacy (DP) has attracted considerable attention as the method ofchoice for releasing aggregate query results making it hard to infer information aboutindividual records in the database. The most common way to achieve DP is to add noisefollowing Laplace distribution. In this paper; we study differential privacy from a utility point ofview for single and multiple queries. We examine the relationship between the cumulativeprobability of noise and the privacy degree. Using this analysis and the notion of relativeerror; we show when for a given problem it is reasonable to employ a differentially privatealgorithm without losing a certain level of utility. For the case of multiple queries; weintroduce a simple DP method called Differential (DIFF) that adds noise proportional to aquery index used to express our preferences for having different noise scales for different …,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2012,6

An experimental evaluation of giraph and GraphChi,Junnan Lu; Alex Thomo,We focus on the vertex-centric (VC) model introduced in Pregel; a Google system fordistributed graph processing. In particular; we consider two popular implementations of theVC model: Apache Giraph and GraphChi. The first is a VC system for cluster computing;while the second is a VC system for a single PC. Apache Giraph became very popular aftercareful engineering by Facebook researchers in 2012 to scale the computation of PageRankto a trillion-edge graph of user interactions using 200 machines. On the other hand;GraphChi became popular; around the same time in 2012; as it made possible to performintensive graph computations in a single PC; in just under 59 minutes; whereas thedistributed systems were taking 400 minutes using a cluster of about 1;000 computers (asreported also by MIT Technology Review).

Extracting association rules from liver cancer data using the FP-growth algorithm,Fabiola Pinheiro; Mu-Hsing Kuo; Alex Thomo; Jeff Barnett,The five-year survival rate of liver cancer is low; 14% according to the Surveillance;Epidemiology; and End Results (SEER) Program database of the National Cancer Institutefrom 2003 to 2007 [3]. Since in the early stages of liver cancer; patients usually do not showsigns or symptoms; improving early diagnosis is essential in order to reduce morbidity andmortality rates. Association rule mining; a popular method for discovering interesting hiddenrelationships or patterns between variables in large databases; has demonstrated benefitwhen applied to cancer detection and management. To date; however; no studies haveapplied it to liver cancer. The objective of this study was to apply the FP-growth associationalgorithm to discover patterns from liver cancer data; which can hopefully be used for earlydetection.,Computational Advances in Bio and Medical Sciences (ICCABS); 2013 IEEE 3rd International Conference on,2013,5
A graph approach to the threshold all-against-all substring matching problem,Marina Barsky; Ulrike Stege; Alex Thomo; Chris Upton,Abstract We present a novel graph model and an efficient algorithm for solving the“threshold all against all” problem; which involves searching two strings (with length M andN; respectively) for all maximal approximate substring matches of length at least S; with up toK differences. Our algorithm solves the problem in time O (MNK 3); which is a considerableimprovement over the previous known bound for this problem. We also provide experimentalevidence that; in practice; our algorithm exhibits a better performance than its worst-caserunning time.,Journal of Experimental Algorithmics (JEA),2008,5
Shortest path approaches for the longest common subsequence of a set of strings,Marina Barsky; Ulrike Stege; Alex Thomo; Chris Upton,We investigate the k-LCS problem that is finding a longest common subsequence (LCS) fork given input strings. The problem is known to have practical solutions for k= 2; but for higherdimensions it is not very well explored. We consider the algorithms by Miller and Myers aswell as Wu et al. which solve the 2-LCS problem; and shed a new light on theirgeneralization to higher dimensions. First; we redesign both algorithms such that thegeneralization to higher dimensions becomes natural. Then we present our algorithms forsolving the k-LCS problem. We further propose a new approach to reduce the algorithms'space complexity. We demonstrate that our algorithms are practical as they significantlyoutperform the dynamic programming approaches. Our results stand in contrast toobservations made in previous work by Irving and Fraser.,Bioinformatics and Bioengineering; 2007. BIBE 2007.

Group-aware weighted bipartite b-matching,Cheng Chen; Sean Chester; Venkatesh Srinivasan; Kui Wu; Alex Thomo,Abstract The weighted bipartite B-matching (WBM) problem models a host of datamanagement applications; ranging from recommender systems to Internet advertising and e-commerce. Many of these applications; however; demand versatile assignment constraints;which WBM is weak at modelling. In this paper; we investigate powerful generalisations ofWBM. We first show that a recent proposal for conflict-aware WBM by Chen et al. is hard toapproximate by reducing their problem from Maximum Weight Independent Set. We thenpropose two related problems; collectively called group-aware WBM. For the first problem;which constrains the degree of groups of vertices; we show that a linear programmingformulation produces a Totally Unimodular (TU) matrix and is thus polynomial-time solvable.Nonetheless; we also give a simple greedy algorithm subject to a 2-extendible system …,Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2016,4
Mining clinical text for stroke prediction,Elham Sedghi; Jens H Weber; Alex Thomo; Maximilian Bibok; Andrew MW Penn,Abstract One of the main problems in treating stroke patients is accurate and timely triageand assessment. Not all stroke events have direct severe consequences. Full strokes areoften preceded by transient ischemic attacks (TIA) or mini strokes; which exhibit signs andsymptoms similar to less concerning health events; eg; migraines. In this paper; naturallanguage techniques are presented to process a large collection of medical narrativedescriptions extracting features that can be subsequently used for automatic classificationusing Data Mining algorithms. We reviewed 5658 cases and analyzed the chief complaintand history of the patient illness reported at stroke rapid assessment unit (SRAU) at VictoriaGeneral Hospital (VGH). Data were collected by neurologists and stroke nurses betweenyears 2008 and 2013.

View-based tree-language rewritings for XML,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Alex Thomo,Abstract We study query rewriting using views (QRV) for XML. Our queries and views areregular tree languages (RTLs) represented by tree automata over marked alphabets; wherethe markers serve as “node selectors”. We formally define query rewriting using views forRTLs and give an automata-based algorithm to compute the maximally contained rewriting.The formalism we use is equal in power with Monadic Second Order (MSO) logic; and ouralgorithm for computing QRV is the first to target this expressive class. Furthermore we provea tight lower bound; thus showing that our algorithm is optimal. Another strength of ourautomata-based approach is that we are able to cast computing QRV into executing asequence of intuitive operations on automata; thus rendering our approach practical as itcan be easily implemented utilizing off-the-shelf automata toolboxes.

Boundedness of regular path queries in data integration systems,Gosta Grahne; Alex Thomo,In this paper we study the problem of deciding whether a regular path query over views indata-integration systems can be re-expressed without recursion. The problem becomeschallenging when the views contain recursion; thereby potentially making recursion in thequery unecessary. We define two related notions of boundedness of regular path queries.For one of the notions we show it PSPACE complete; and obtain a constructive method foroptimizing regular path queries in data-integration systems. For the other notion ofboundedness; we show it PTIME reducible to the notorious problem of limitedness indistance automata; for which only exponential time algorithms are currently known.,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2007.

Distributed multi-source regular path queries,Maryam Shoaran; Alex Thomo,Abstract Regular path queries are the building block of almost any mechanism for queryingsemistructured data. Despite the fact that the main applications of such data are distributed;there are only few works dealing with distributed evaluation of regular path queries. In thispaper we present a message-efficient and truly distributed algorithm for computing theanswer to regular path queries in a multi-source semistructured database setting. Ouralgorithm is general as it works for the larger class of weighted regular path queries onweighted (as well) semistructured databases.,International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing and Applications,2007,4
Efficient implementation of anchored 2-core algorithm,Babak Tootoonchi; Venkatesh Srinivasan; Alex Thomo,Abstract Often graph theory is used to model and analyze different behaviors of networksincluding social networks. Nowadays; social networks have become very popular and socialnetwork providers try to expand their networks by encouraging people to stay engaged andactive. Studies show that engagement and activities of people in social networks influenceengagement of their connections. This behavior has been modeled by the k-core problem ingraph theory with the assumption that a person stays active in the network if he or she has kor more connections. In the above model if a person drops out; his or her friends canbecome discouraged and they might also drop out. An approach called anchored k-corealgorithm has been introduced lately that prevents a cascade of drop-outs by finding nodeswhich have the most influence on their connections and rewarding them to stay in the …,Proceedings of the 2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining 2017,2017,3
Dynamis: Effective context-aware web service selection using dynamic attributes,Atousa Pahlevan; Jean-Luc Duprat; Alex Thomo; Hausi Müller,Abstract: Quality web service discovery requires narrowing the search space from anoverwhelming set of services down to the most relevant ones; while matching theconsumer's request. Today; the ranking of services only considers static attributes orsnapshots of current attribute values; resulting in low-quality search results. To satisfy theuser's need for timely; well-chosen web services; we ought to consider quality of serviceattributes. The problem is that dynamic attributes can be difficult to measure; frequentlyfluctuate; are context-sensitive and depend on environmental factors; such as networkavailability at query time. In this paper; we propose the Dynamis algorithm to address thesechallenges effectively. Dynamis is based on well-established database techniques; such asskyline and aggregation. We illustrate our approach using observatory telescope web …,Future Internet,2015,3
A case study of applying data mining to sensor data for contextual requirements analysis,Angela Rook; Alessia Knauss; Daniela Damian; Alex Thomo,Determining the context situations specific to contextual requirements is challenging;particularly for environments that are largely unobservable by system designers (eg;dangerous system contexts of use and mobile applications). In this paper; we describe theapplication of data mining techniques in a case study of identifying contextual requirementsfor a context-aware mobile application to be used by a team of four long-distance rowers.The context of use for this application was dangerous and isolated; making it unobservableby the developers. The context situations for five mobile application requirements weredefined by using a data mining algorithm applied to historical sensor data passivelycollected by the users while they crossed the Atlantic Ocean in a rowboat. The performanceof the resulting classifiers is analyzed over time with promising results demonstrating that …,Artificial Intelligence for Requirements Engineering (AIRE); 2014 IEEE 1st International Workshop on,2014,3
Three-way joins on mapreduce: An experimental study,Ben Kimmett; Alex Thomo; S Venkatesh,We study three-way joins on MapReduce. Joins are very useful in a multitude of applicationsfrom data integration and traversing social networks; to mining graphs and automata-basedconstructions. However; joins are expensive; even for moderate data sets; we need efficientalgorithms to perform distributed computation of joins using clusters of many machines.MapReduce has become an increasingly popular distributed computing system andprogramming paradigm. We consider a state-of-the-art MapReduce multi-way join algorithmby Afrati and Ullman and show when it is appropriate for use on very large data sets. Byproviding a detailed experimental study; we demonstrate that this algorithm scales muchbetter than what is suggested by the original paper.

Mining frequent highly-correlated item-pairs at very low support levels,Ian Sandler,Abstract The ability to extract frequent pairs from a set of transactions is one of thefundamental building blocks of data mining. When the number of items in a given transactionis relatively small the problem is trivial. Even when dealing with millions of transactions it isstill trivial if the number of unique items in the transaction set is small. The problem becomesmuch more challenging when we deal with millions of transactions; each containinghundreds of items that are part of a set of millions of potential items. Especially when we arelooking for highly correlated results at extremely low support levels.,*,2011,3
Fuzzy joins in mapreduce: an experimental study,Ben Kimmett; Venkatesh Srinivasan; Alex Thomo,Abstract We report experimental results for the MapReduce algorithms proposed by Afrati;Das Sarma; Menestrina; Parameswaran and Ullman in ICDE'12 to compute fuzzy joins ofbinary strings using Hamming Distance. Their algorithms come with complete theoreticalanalysis; however; no experimental evaluation is provided. They argue that there is atradeoff between communication cost and processing cost; and that there is a skyline of theproposed algorithms; ie none dominates another. We observe via experiments that; from apractical point of view; some algorithms are almost always preferable to others. We providedetailed experimental results and insights that show the different facets of each algorithm.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,2
Semantic graph compression with hypergraphs,Arber Borici; Alex Thomo,Can we model complex networks as hyper graphs and compress them for faster storage;transmission; and mining of data? In this paper; we propose a modeling and compressiontechnique that consists of two phases:(i) mapping networks to hyper graphs by exploitinginherent or structural semantic features; and (ii) partitioning the resulting hyper graph suchthat similar nodes are grouped into a number of possibly disconnected parts. The partitionedhyper graph is then processed in order to yield more structural redundancy to increasecompression. We provide empirical results that compare the proposed method to randomand natural orderings of select real networks using an information-theoretic measure. Whenmodeling networks using hyper graphs as proposed here; the potential for compactness andcompression increases; as observed in our experimental evaluation.

Integrating data mining into feedback loops for predictive context adaptation,Angela Rook; Alessia Knauss; Daniela Damian; Hausi A Muller; Alex Thomo,Requirements for today's systems are increasingly valid only within certain operatingcontexts. Requirements engineering and implementation stages of system developmentmust carefully consider how to integrate evolving context related to specific requirements inorder for the system to stay relevant and flexible. In this paper we propose to use datamining techniques for predictive context adaptation. Our approach leverages data collectedfrom the past and decides; based on this historical data; which context conditions to monitorin order to predictively identify when a system needs to be adapted to fulfill a particularrequirement. We demonstrate our approach on an adaptive mobile application to supportthe coordination of a team of rowers in an environment with a continually changingoperational context.,*,2013,2
Large-scale mining of co-occurrences: Challenges and solutions,Ian Sandler; Alex Thomo,The ability to extract frequent pairs from a set of baskets (or frequent word co-occurrencesfrom a set of documents) is one of the fundamental building blocks of data mining. When thenumber of items in a given basket is relatively small the problem is trivial. Even whendealing with millions of baskets it is still trivial providing that the number of unique items inthe basket set is small. The problem becomes much more challenging when we deal withmillions of baskets; each containing hundreds of items that are part of a set of millions ofpotential items. Especially when we are looking for highly correlated results at extremely lowsupport levels. A particularly difficult case is when" items" are words and" baskets" are longdocuments in a very large text corpus.

Full-text (substring) indexes in external memory,Marina Barsky; Ulrike Stege; Alex Thomo,Abstract Nowadays; textual databases are among the most rapidly growing collections ofdata. Some of these collections contain a new type of data that differs from classicalnumerical or textual data. These are long sequences of symbols; not divided into well-separated small tokens (words). The most prominent among such collections are databasesof biological sequences; which are experiencing today an unprecedented growth rate.Starting in 2008; the" 1000 Genomes Project" has been launched with the ultimate goal ofcollecting sequences of additional 1;500 Human genomes; 500 each of European; African;and East Asian origin. This will produce an extensive catalog of Human genetic variations.The size of just the raw sequences in this catalog would be about 5 terabytes.

On supporting dynamic web service selection with histogramming,Atousa Pahlevan; Sean Chester; Alex Thomo; Hausi A Müller,To ensure that consumer requests for web services are served successfully and effectivelyamidst overwhelming options; one must narrow the web service search to only the mostqualified; highest-ranked services. However; today; the ranking of services is done only withregards to static attributes or with a snapshot of current values; resulting in low qualitysearch results. To improve user experience; one must consider dynamic quality of servicemeasures and address the practical challenges they incur. In this paper; we propose usinghistograms and an area-to-right-of-threshold function to handle the fluctuation and absenceof attributes values effectively. This permits utilizing well-established techniques for selectingweb services; such as skyline and top-k. We also discuss algorithmic considerations toefficiently produce dynamic web service discovery results.,Maintenance and Evolution of Service-Oriented and Cloud-Based Systems (MESOCA); 2011 International Workshop on the,2011,2
Certain answers and rewritings for local regular path queries on graph-structured data,Maryam Shoaran; Alex Thomo,Abstract In this paper we explore the connection between certain answers and view-basedrewritings for local regular path queries (RPQs) which are regular expressions matchingpaths in graph-structured data starting from a specific node. We show that differently from thecase of global RPQs; which match paths starting from any node; the notions of certainanswer and rewriting-based answer coincide for local RPQs. The importance of this result isthat obtaining the certain answer for local RPQs can be done in polynomial time in the sizeof the data. We also present an automata-theoretic algorithm for computing maximal view-based rewritings. Notably; these rewritings are an exponential order of magnitude smallerthan their counterparts for global RPQs.,Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Database Engineering & Applications Symposium,2010,2
Evolving schemas for streaming xml,Maryam Shoaran; Alex Thomo,Abstract In this paper we model schema evolution for XML by defining formal languageoperators on Visibly Pushdown Languages (VPLs). Our goal is to provide a framework forefficient validation of streaming XML in the realistic setting where the schemas of theexchanging parties evolve and thus diverge from one another. We show that VisiblyPushdown Languages are closed under the defined language operators and this enablesus to expand the schemas (for XML) in order to account for flexible or constrained evolution.,International Symposium on Foundations of Information and Knowledge Systems,2010,2
Scalable ubiquitous data access in clustered sensor networks,Yueh-Hua Lee; Alex Thomo; Kui Wu; Valerie King,Abstract Wireless sensor networks have drawn much attention due to their ability to monitorecosystems and wildlife habitats. In such systems; the data should be intelligently collectedto avoid human intervention. For this; we propose a network infrastructure in which thesensor nodes are designated as “data-generating” or “data-storage” nodes. Data-generatingnodes take measurements; whereas data-storage nodes make themselves available tocompute and store checksums of data received from nearby data-generating nodes. Wepropose a spatially-clustered architecture for our storage nodes and a coding scheme thatallows a data collector to recover all original data by querying only a small random subset ofstorage nodes from each cluster. The size of such a subset is equal to the number of data-generating nodes that the cluster serves. When the clustering structure of the storage …,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2008,2
Towards practically feasible answering of regular path queries in lav data integration,Manuel Tamashiro; Alex Thomo; Srinivasan Venkatesh,Abstract Regular path queries (RPQ's) are given by means of regular expressions and askfor matching patterns on labeled graphs. RPQ's have received great attention in the contextof semistructured data; which are data whose structure is irregular; partially known; orsubject to frequent changes. One of the most important problems in databases today is theintegration of semistructured data from multiple sources modeled as views. The well-knowparadigm of computing first a view-based rewriting of the query; and then evaluating therewriting on the view extensions is indeed possible for RPQ's. However; computing therewriting is computationally hard as it can only be done (in the worst case) in not less than2EXPTIME. In this paper; we provide practical evidence that computing the rewriting is hardon the average as well. On the positive side; we propose automata-theoretic techniques …,Proceedings of the sixteenth ACM conference on Conference on information and knowledge management,2007,2

Mining Association Rules in the BCCA Liver Cancer Data Set.,Fabiola MR Pinheiro; Mu-Hsing Kuo; Alex Thomo; Jeff Barnett,Abstract. The objective of this study is to apply data mining techniques to determine factorsthat are commonly associated with liver cancer incidence; using an anonymized data set of6064 patients from the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA). The association rulesindicate that in BC the patient demographic factors associated with increased liver cancerinclude: age ranges 60-69; male gender; and geographic location in the Greater Vancouverarea. The main factors associated with decreased survivability in BC were being male and inthe age range 70-79. In the Yukon; being male and in the age range 60-69 was the mainfactor associated with both increased incidence of liver cancer and decreased survivability.,ITCH,2015,1
Utilizing favorites lists for better recommendations,Mustafa Abualsaud; Alex Thomo,We present two new models that take into account the information available in user-created"favorites" lists for enhancing the quality of item recommendation. The first model uses thepopularity and ratings of items in the lists to predict ratings for new items to users that haverated some items on the lists. The second model is a matrix factorization model thatincorporates lists as implicit feedback in ratings prediction. We compare our two approachesagainst another work for utilizing favorites lists; as well as the popular Singular ValueDecomposition (SVD) ontwo large Amazon datasets and show that utilizing favorites listsgives significant improvements; especially in cold-start cases.,Big Data and Cloud Computing (BdCloud); 2014 IEEE Fourth International Conference on,2014,1

Anonymization and De-anonymization of Social Network Data,Sean Chester; Bruce M Kapron; Gautam Srivastava; Venkatesh Srinivasan; Alex Thomo,Diffusion can be described as “the process by which an innovation is communicated throughcertain channels over time among the members of a social system”(Rogers 1995). Theinnovations can be ideas; products; or behaviors but in general can refer to anything that isperceived as new or novel by the individuals of the social system. The innovations spreadfrom originating sources to prospective users and individuals. Diffusion theories and modelsare used to describe how these innovations may spread and are adopted by the individualsover time. This entry presents an,*,2014,1
Social web search,Maryam Shoaran; Alex Thomo; Jens Weber,While a great many useful statistical models and visualizations have been developed toexplore large-scale complex networks; fewer have attempted to relate these models to datagenerated by samples. While; in many fields; complete (or near-complete) data is widelyavailable; and while the Internet has made even more readily available; complete dataabout large-scale complex networks sufficient to answer many compelling social sciencequestions does not exist and cannot be reasonably generated. In these cases; samplingtheory must be used to connect data to models. This proves difficult for a variety of reasonssuch as: data collection methodologies which; while attempting to overcome nonresponsebias; deviate from standard sampling practices; and; the non-independence of both firstneighbors and second neighbors.

Indexing reverse top-k queries,Sean Chester; Alex Thomo; S Venkatesh; Sue Whitesides,Abstract: We consider the recently introduced monochromatic reverse top-k queries whichask for; given a new tuple q and a dataset D; all possible top-k queries on D union {q} forwhich q is in the result. Towards this problem; we focus on designing indexes in twodimensions for repeated (or batch) querying; a novel but practical consideration. We presentthe insight that by representing the dataset as an arrangement of lines; a critical k-polygoncan be identified and used exclusively to respond to reverse top-k queries. We construct anindex based on this observation which has guaranteed worst-case query cost that islogarithmic in the size of the k-polygon. We implement our work and compare it to relatedapproaches; demonstrating that our index is fast in practice. Furthermore; we demonstratethrough our experiments that a k-polygon is comprised of a small proportion of the …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1205.0837,2012,1
Learning the news in social networks,Krishnan Rajagopalan; Venkatesh Srinivasan; Alex Thomo,Abstract In social media such as facebook; the most popular desire is to learn the newsabout other people. In this paper; we study the following problem related to informationpropagation: Suppose that there is a set U of N users in a social network. They meet onlinefrom time to time and share information they know about themselves and the other users inthe network. Whenever a group g⊂ U of users meet; they want to know who has the latestinformation about every user in U. A naive solution to this problem is to use timestamps.However; there are drawbacks to this scheme including the burden on the users to maintainreliable timestamps and the fact that the timestamps grow unbounded over time. It is naturalto ask if it is possible to learn the latest information without using timestamps. We present anefficient method which removes the need to timestamp user information (news).

Online update of b-trees,Marina Barsky; Alex Thomo; Zoltan Toth; Calisto Zuzarte,Abstract Many scenarios impose a heavy update load on B-tree indexes in moderndatabases. A typical case is when B-trees are used for indexing all the keywords of a textfield. For example upon the insertion of a new text record (eg a new document arrives); abarrage of new keywords has to be inserted into the index causing many random disk I/Osand interrupting the normal operation of the database. The common approach has been tocollect the updates in a separate structure and then perform a batch update of the index.This update" freezes" the database. Many applications; however; require the immediateavailability of the new updates without any interruption of the normal database operation. Inthis paper we present a novel online B-tree update method based on a new buffering datastructure we introduce-Dynamic Bucket Tree (DBT).

Bounded regular path queries in view-based data integration,Gösta Grahne; Alex Thomo,Abstract In this paper we study the problem of deciding boundedness of (recursive) regularpath queries over views in data integration systems; that is; whether a query can be re-expressed without recursion. This problem becomes challenging when the views containrecursion; thereby potentially making recursion in the query unnecessary. We define andsolve two related problems of boundedness of regular path queries. One of the problemsasks for the existence of a bound; and the other; more restricted one; asks if the query isbounded within a given parameter. For the more restricted version we show it PSPACEcomplete; and obtain a constructive method for optimizing the queries. For the existentialversion of boundedness; we show it PTIME reducible to the notorious problem of limitednessin distance automata. This problem has received a lot attention in the formal language …,Information Processing Letters,2009,1
Data Structures for Efficient Computation of Influence Maximization and Influence Estimation,Diana Popova; Akshay Khot; Alex Thomo,Algorithmic problems of computing influence estimation and influence maximization havebeen extensively studied for decades. We researched several data structures forimplementing the Reverse Influence Sampling method proposed by Borgs; Brautbar;Chayes; and Lucier in 2014. Our implementations solve the problems of influence estimationand influence maximization in large graphs fast and using small memory footprint. Forinstance; we are able to produce results 3 times faster and scale 8 times more than a state-of-the-art algorithm; all this while preserving the theoretical guarantees of Borgs et al. forReverse Influence Sampling.,*,2018,*
Computing source-to-target shortest paths for complex networks in RDBMS,Aly Ahmed; Alex Thomo,Abstract How do we deal with the exponential growth of complex networks? Are existingalgorithms introduced decades ago able to work on big network graphs? In this work; wefocus on computing shortest paths (SP) from a source to a target in large network graphs.Main memory algorithms require the graph to fit in memory and they falter when thisrequirement is not met. We explore SQL-based solutions using a Relational DatabaseManagement System (RDBMS). Our approach leverages the intelligent scheduling that aRDBMS performs when executing set-at-a-time expansions of graph vertices; which is incontrast to vertex-at-a-time expansions in classical SP algorithms. Our algorithms performorders of magnitude faster than baselines and even faster than main memory algorithms forlarge graphs. Also; we show that our algorithms on RDBMS outperform counterparts …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2017,*

Taking advantage of this trend; brick-and-mortar retailers havebeen increasingly deploying free Wi-Fi hotspots to provide easy Internet access for theircustomers. This opens the opportunity for retailers to collect customer information andperform data mining to improve the quality of their service. In this paper; we propose a novelvalue-added service to Wi-Fi data mining; Rec2PI; which can infer users' preference profilesbased on recommendations pushed by third-party apps. Such profiles can be used toimprove users' online experience and enable a brick-and-mortar retailer to participate in theglobal advertising business.

Incorporating User Reviews as Implicit Feedback for Improving Recommender Systems,Yasamin Heshmat Dehkordi; Alex Thomo; Sudhakar Ganti,Recommendation systems have become extremely common in recent years due to theubiquity of information across various applications. Online entertainment (eg; Netflix); E-commerce (eg; Amazon; Ebay) and publishing services such as Google News are allexamples of services which use recommender systems. Recommendation systems arerapidly evolving in these years; but these methods have fallen short in coping with severalemerging trends such as likes or votes on reviews. In this paper we have proposed a newmethod based on collaborative filtering by considering other users' feedback on eachreview. To validate our approach we have compared our method with several knownmethods on Yelp data set. Our algorithm outperforms other approaches in terms of accuracyby as much as 9.5%.

We focus on the problem of recommending buyers to sellerswhich comes with new challenges:(1) constraints on the number of recommendationsbuyers are part of before they become overwhelmed;(2) constraints on the number ofrecommendations sellers receive within their budget; and (3) constraints on the set of buyersthat sellers want to receive (eg; no more than two people from the same household). Wepropose the following critical problems of recommending buyers to sellers: ConstrainedRecommendation (C-REC) capturing the first two challenges; and Conflict-AwareConstrained Recommendation (CAC-REC) capturing all three challenges at the same time.We show that C-REC can be modeled using linear programming and can be efficiently …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1406.0455,2014,*
Implication of regular expressions,Alex Thomo,Abstract In this work we study the following implication problem for regularexpressions:“Given a set of regular expressions R and a regular expression S; is it true thatevery string which matches the regular expressions in R also matches S?” The problemcomes in two flavors:“non-disjoint” and “disjoint”. We show that both of them are PSPACE-complete. While the complexity for the first variant is not surprising–the problem is coNP-complete even for very simple patterns (given by wildcards)–the complexity result for thesecond variant represents a big jump since the problem is in PTIME for the case of patternswith wildcards. Towards the goal of charting the boundary of tractability; we then present ananalysis of when the problem remains in PTIME.,Applied Mathematics Letters,2012,*
Computing optimal k-regret minimizing sets with top-k depth contours,Sean Chester; Alex Thomo; S Venkatesh; Sue Whitesides,Abstract: Regret minimizing sets are a very recent approach to representing a dataset D witha small subset S of representative tuples. The set S is chosen such that executing any top-1query on S rather than D is minimally perceptible to any user. To discover an optimal regretminimizing set of a predetermined cardinality is conjectured to be a hard problem. In thispaper; we generalize the problem to that of finding an optimal k $ regret minimizing set;wherein the difference is computed over top-k queries; rather than top-1 queries. We adaptknown geometric ideas of top-k depth contours and the reverse top-k problem. We show thatthe depth contours themselves offer a means of comparing the optimality of regretminimizing sets using L2 distance. We design an O (cn^ 2) plane sweep algorithm for twodimensions to compute an optimal regret minimizing set of cardinality c. For higher …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1207.6329,2012,*

Query optimization using views in semistructured databases,Alex-Imir Thomo,A wealth of query languages for semistructured graph data has emerged; and what almostall of these languages have in common is a graph navigation mechanism; which is notusually found in their relational predecessors. However; the navigation is very expensivesince it typically involves many database or network accesses. As a consequence; theoptimization of the navigational part of the queries is essential for having commerciallyattractive query; processors similar to those for relational data. One of the most well knownways for optimizing a query in general; is to use available information in precomputed ormaterialized views. At the heart of our approaches is the leverage of the concept of queryrewritings using views. The query rewriting is a well known problem; which has been solvedand deeply investigated for (non-recursive) queries over relational data. However; for …,*,2003,*

Why Waldo Befriended the Dummy,Sean Chester; Bruce M Kapron; Ganesh Ramesh; Gautam Srivastava; Alex Thomo; S Venkatesh,Abstract For a graph-based representation of a social network; the identity of participantscan be uniquely determined if an adversary has background structural knowledge about thegraph. We focus on degree-based attacks; wherein the adversary knows the degrees ofparticular target vertices and we aim to protect the anonymity of participants through k-anonymization; which ensures that every participant is equivalent to at least k− 1 otherparticipants with respect to degree. We introduce a natural and novel approach ofintroducing “dummy” participants into the network and linking them to each other and to realparticipants in order to achieve this anonymity. The advantage of our approach lies in thenature of the results that we derive. We show that if participants have labels associated withthem; the problem of anonymizing a subset of participants is NP-Complete. On the other …,*,*,*
