System integration-A major step toward lab on a chip,Mandy LY Sin; Jian Gao; Joseph C Liao; Pak Kin Wong,Microfluidics holds great promise to revolutionize various areas of biological engineering;such as single cell analysis; environmental monitoring; regenerative medicine; and point-of-care diagnostics. Despite the fact that intensive efforts have been devoted into the field in thepast decades; microfluidics has not yet been adopted widely. It is increasingly realized thatan effective system integration strategy that is low cost and broadly applicable to variousbiological engineering situations is required to fully realize the potential of microfluidics.
