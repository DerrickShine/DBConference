Super-peer-based routing and clustering strategies for RDF-based peer-to-peer networks,Wolfgang Nejdl; Martin Wolpers; Wolf Siberski; Christoph Schmitz; Mario Schlosser; Ingo Brunkhorst; Alexander Löser,Abstract RDF-based P2P networks have a number of advantages compared with simplerP2P networks such as Napster; Gnutella or with approaches based on distributed indicessuch as CAN and CHORD. RDF-based P2P networks allow complex and extendabledescriptions of resources instead of fixed and limited ones; and they provide complex queryfacilities against these metadata instead of simple keyword-based searches. In previouspapers; we have described the Edutella infrastructure and different kinds of Edutella peersimplementing such an RDF-based P2P network. In this paper we will discuss these RDF-based P2P networks as a specific example of a new type of P2P networks; schema-basedP2P networks; and describe the use of super-peer based topologies for these networks.Super-peer based networks can provide better scalability than broadcast based networks …,Proceedings of the 12th international conference on World Wide Web,2003,438
Semantic overlay clusters within super-peer networks,Alexander Löser; Felix Naumann; Wolf Siberski; Wolfgang Nejdl; Uwe Thaden,Abstract When joining information provider peers to a peer-to-peer network; an arbitrarydistribution is sub-optimal. In fact; clustering peers by their characteristics; enhances searchand integration significantly. Currently super-peer networks; such as the Edutella network;provide no sophisticated means for such a” semantic clustering” of peers. We introduce theconcept of semantic overlay clusters (SOC) for super-peer networks enabling a controlleddistribution of peers to clusters. In contrast to the recently announced semantic overlaynetwork approach designed for flat; pure peer-to-peer topologies and for limited meta datasets; such as simple filenames; we allow a clustering of complex heterogeneous schemesknown from relational databases and use advantages of super-peer networks; such asefficient search and broadcast of messages. Our approach is based on predefined …,International Workshop on Databases; Information Systems; and Peer-to-Peer Computing,2003,174
Information integration in schema-based peer-to-peer networks,Alexander Löser; Wolf Siberski; Martin Wolpers; Wolfgang Nejdl,Abstract Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks have become an important infrastructure during thelast years. Using P2P networks for distributed information systems allows us to shift the focusfrom centrally organized to distributed information systems where all peers can provide andhave access to information. In previous papers; we have described an RDF-based P2Pinfrastructure called Edutella which is a specific example of a more advanced approach toP2P networks called schema-based peer-to-peer networks. Schema-based P2P networkshave a number of advantages compared with simpler P2P networks such as Napster orGnutella. Instead of prescribing one global schema to describe content; they supportarbitrary metadata schemas and ontologies (crucial for the Semantic Web). Thereby theyallow complex and extendable descriptions of resources thus introducing dynamic …,International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering,2003,81

Semantic social overlay networks,Alexander Loser; Steffen Staab; Christoph Tempich,Peer selection for query routing is a core task in peer-to-peer networks. Unstructured peer-to-peer systems (like Gnutella) ignore this problem; leading to an abundance of network traffic.Structured peer-to-peer systems (like Chord) enforce a particular; global way of distributingdata among the peers in order to solve this problem; but then encounter problems of networkvolatility and conflicts with the autonomy of the peer data management. In this paper; wepropose a new mechanism; INGA; which is based on the observation that query routing insocial networks is made possible by locally available knowledge about the expertise ofneighbors and a semantics-based peer selection function. We validate INGA by simulationexperiments with different data sets. We compare INGA with competing peer selectionmechanisms on resulting parameters like recall; message gain or number of messages …,IEEE Journal on selected areas in communications,2007,65
Kraken: N-ary facts in open information extraction,Alan Akbik; Alexander Löser,Abstract Current techniques for Open Information Extraction (OIE) focus on the extraction ofbinary facts and suffer significant quality loss for the task of extracting higher order N-aryfacts. This quality loss may not only affect the correctness; but also the completeness of anextracted fact. We present KrakeN; an OIE system specifically designed to capture N-aryfacts; as well as the results of an experimental study on extracting facts from Web text inwhich we examine the issue of fact completeness. Our preliminary experiments indicate thatKrakeN is a high precision OIE approach that captures more facts per sentence at greatercompleteness than existing OIE approaches; but is vulnerable to noisy and ungrammaticaltext.,Proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Automatic Knowledge Base Construction and Web-scale Knowledge Extraction,2012,55

Situational business intelligence,Alexander Löser; Fabian Hueske; Volker Markl,Abstract Traditional business intelligence has focused on creating dimensional models anddata warehouses; where after a high modeling and creation cost structurally similar queriesare processed on a regular basis. So called" ad-hoc" queries aggregate data from one orseveral dimensional models; but fail to incorporate other external information that is notconsidered in the pre-defined data model. We focus on a different kind of businessintelligence; which spontaneously correlates data from a company's data warehouse with"external" information sources that may come from the corporate intranet; are acquired fromsome external vendor; or are derived from the internet. Such situational applications areusually short-lived programs created for a small group of users with a specific businessneed.

Navigating the intranet with high precision,Huaiyu Zhu; Sriram Raghavan; Shivakumar Vaithyanathan; Alexander Löser,Abstract Despite the success of web search engines; search over large enterprise intranetsstill suffers from poor result quality. Earlier work [6] that compared intranets and the Internetfrom the view point of keyword search has pointed to several reasons why the searchproblem is quite different in these two domains. In this paper; we address the problem ofproviding high quality answers to navigational queries in the intranet (eg; queries intendedto find product or personal home pages; service pages; etc.). Our approach is based onoffline identification of navigational pages; intelligent generation of term-variants toassociate with each page; and the construction of separate indices exclusively devoted toanswering navigational queries. Using a testbed of 5.5 M pages from the IBM intranet; wepresent evaluation results that demonstrate that for navigational queries; our approach of …,Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web,2007,39

In this paper we present innovative algorithmscalled INGA (Interest-based Node Grouping Algorithms) which integrate personal routingindices into semantic query processing to boost performance. Similar to social networkspeers in INGA cooperate to efficiently route queries for documents along adaptive shortcut-based overlays using only local; but semantically well chosen information.

Semantic methods for p2p query routing,Alexander Löser; Steffen Staab; Christoph Tempich,Abstract Knowledge sharing in a virtual organization requires a knowledge life cycleincluding knowledge provisioning; terminology alignment; determination of resourcelocation; query routing; and query answering. In this talk we focus on the issue ofdetermining a relevant resource in a completely decentralized setting such as necessitatedby peer-to-peer knowledge management in virtual organizations. Requirements for this taskinclude; eg; full autonomy of peers as well as full control over own resources and thereforepreclude prominent resource location and query routing schemes such as distributed hashtables. In order to tackle given requirements we use a resource location and query routingapproach that exploits social metaphors of topical experts and experts' experts as well assemantic similarity of queries and information sources.

Efficient data store discovery in a scientific P2P network,Alexander Löser; Martin Wolpers; Wolf Siberski; Wolfgang Nejdl,Abstract In this paper we propose to use schema-based peer-to-peer systems for theexchange of scienitific documents. Compared with recent file sharing networks highlydomain-oriented scientific documents are shared in relatively small research communitieswith tight internal and only a few external connections. The documents are annotated withsmall a but welldefined sets of metadata using standard taxonomies and are stored in manydistributed; autonomous; heterogenous data repositories. As a recent development super-peer networks emerge improving the network performance by clustering peers at super-peers. By using Semantic Overlay Clusters (SOC) for clustering the super-peer networks weenable the creation of context-specific; logical views over the physical P2P network topologyaccording to the research communities demands.

Unsupervised discovery of relations and discriminative extraction patterns,Alan Akbik; Larysa Visengeriyeva; Priska Herger; Holmer Hemsen; Alexander Löser,ABSTRACT Unsupervised Relation Extraction (URE) is the task of extracting relations of apriori unknown semantic types using clustering methods on a vector space model of entitypairs and patterns. In this paper; we show that an informed feature generation techniquebased on dependency trees significantly improves clustering quality; as measured by the F-score; and therefore the ability of the URE method to discover relations in text. Furthermore;we extend URE to produce a set of weighted patterns for each identified relation that can beused by an information extraction system to find further instances of this relation. Eachpattern is assigned to one or multiple relations with different confidence strengths; indicatinghow reliably a pattern evokes a relation; using the theory of Discriminative CategoryMatching.

On Ranking Peers in Semantic Overlay Networks.,Alexander Löser; Christoph Tempich,Abstract. Knowledge management solutions relying on central repositories sometimes havenot met expectations; since users often create knowledge ad-hoc using their individualvocabulary and using their own individual IT infrastructure (eg; their laptop). The introductionof the peer-to-peer paradigm to knowledge management is currently seen as a promisingtechnology to overcome this challenge. A major problem within peer-to-peer systems is tofind the best peer given a certain query. In this paper we introduce three semantic overlaylayers which can be used to score the known peers according to their probability to answer aquery. We here consider queries for documents organized in a topic hierarchy. Since; thepeer selection problem is very similar to the task of finding an expert within an organization;the algorithms can also be used in such a scenario.,Wissensmanagement,2005,20

Near-duplicate detection for web-forums,Klemens Muthmann; Wojciech M Barczyński; Falk Brauer; Alexander Löser,Abstract Current forum search technologies lack the ability to identify threads with near-duplicate content and to group these threads in the search results. As a result; forum usersare overloaded with duplicated search results and prefer to create new threads withouttrying to find existing ones. In this paper we therefore identify common reasons leading tonear-duplicates and develop a new near-duplicate detection algorithm for forum threads.The algorithm is implemented using a large case study of a real-world forum serving morethan one million users. We compare this work with current algorithms; similar to [4; 5]; fordetecting near-duplicates on machine generated web pages. Our preliminary results show;that we significantly outperform these algorithms and that we are able to group forumthreads with a precision of 74%.,Proceedings of the 2009 International Database Engineering & Applications Symposium,2009,17
Community based ranking in peer-to-peer networks,Christoph Tempich; Alexander Löser; Jörg Heizmann,Abstract We address the problem of efficiently ranking the best peers wrt a query withmultiple; equally weighted predicates–conjunctive queries–in shortcut overlay networks.This problem occurs when routing queries in unstructured peer-to-peer networks; such as inpeer-to-peer information retrieval applications. Requirements for this task include; eg; fullautonomy of peers as well as full control over own resources. Therefore prominent resourcelocation and query routing schemes such as distributed hash tables can not be applied inthis setting. In order to tackle these requirements we combine a new resource location andquery routing approach that exploits social metaphors of topical experts and experts' expertswith standard IR measures for ranking peers based on collection-wide information.

FactCrawl: A Fact Retrieval Framework for Full-Text Indices.,Christoph Boden; Alexander Löser; Christoph Nagel; Stephan Pieper,ABSTRACT We present FactCrawl; a framework for retrieving structured; factual informationleveraging the full-text index of a search engine. The framework applies an approximationalgorithm to solve problem of retrieving all facts in a document collection using a minimal setof keywords while minimizing cost. The search engine is queried with automaticallygenerated keywords; the results are re-ranked according to our fact score and documentsare forwarded to a fact extractor. Keywords are determined using structural; syntactic; lexicaland semantic information from sample documents. We estimate the fact score of a documentby combining the observations of keywords in the document.

Augmenting tables by self-supervised web search,Alexander Löser; Christoph Nagel; Stephan Pieper,Abstract Often users are faced with the problem of searching the Web for missing values of aspread sheet. It is a fact that today only a few US-based search engines have the capacity toaggregate the wealth of information hidden in Web pages that could be used to return thesemissing values. Therefore exploiting this information with structured queries; such as joinqueries; is an often requested; but still unsolved requirement of many Web users. A majorchallenge in this scenario is identifying keyword queries for retrieving relevant pages from aWeb search engine. We solve this challenge by automatically generating keywords. Ourapproach is based on the observation that Web page authors have already evolvedcommon words and grammatical structures for describing important relationship types. Eachkeyword query should return only pages that likely contain a missing relation. Therefore …,International Workshop on Business Intelligence for the Real-Time Enterprise,2010,11

How to model Semantic Peer-to-Peer Overlays?,Christoph Schmitz; Alexander Löser,Abstract: Simulation studies are frequently used to evaluate new semantic peer-topeersearching techniques. However; one major problem is the lack of a common evaluationstandard and of common data sets. Therefore; comparing results and routing approachesfrom different research groups often is not possible. Based on our recent experiments andsimulations we present a common model; evaluation metrics; and data sets for semanticpeer-to-peer networks. Ideally; we like to encourage the community to work towards acommon evaluation standard.,GI Jahrestagung (1),2006,9
Effective selectional restrictions for unsupervised relation extraction,Alan Akbik; Larysa Visengeriyeva; Johannes Kirschnick; Alexander Löser,Abstract Unsupervised Relation Extraction (URE) methods automatically discover semanticrelations in text corpora of unknown content and extract for each discovered relation a set ofrelation instances. Due to the sparsity of the feature space; URE is vulnerable to ambiguitiesand underspecification in patterns. In this paper; we propose to increase the discriminativepower of patterns in URE using selectional restrictions (SR). We propose a method thatutilizes a Web-derived soft clustering of n-grams to model selectional restrictions in the opendomain. We comparatively evaluate our method against a baseline without SR; a setup inwhich standard 7-class Named Entity types are used as SR and a setup that models SRusing a finegrained entity type system.

Classification algorithms for relation prediction,Christoph Boden; Thomas Häfele; Alexander Löser,Knowledge discovery from the Web is a cyclic process. In this paper we focus on theimportant part of transforming unstructured information from Web pages into structuredrelations. Relation extraction systems capture information from natural language text on Webpages; called Web text. However; extraction is quite costly and time consuming. Worse;many Web pages may not contain a textual representation of a relation that the extractor cancapture. As a result many irrelevant pages are processed by relation extractors. We proposea relation predictor to filter out irrelevant pages and substantially speed up the overallinformation extraction process. As a classifier; we trained a support vector machine (SVM).We evaluate pages on a sentence level; where each sentence is transformed into a tokenrepresentation of shallow text features.

Our query processortransforms a structured user query into keyword queries that are submitted to a searchengine; forwards search results to a relation extractor; and then combines relations intocomplex result tuples. The processor automatically learns discriminative and effectivekeywords for different types of semantic relations. Thereby; our query processor leveragesthe index of a search engine to query potentially billions of pages. Unfortunately; relationextractors may fail to return a relation for a result tuple.

Our approach is based ondeep contextual sequence learning and utilizes stacked bidirectional LSTM networks. Ourmodel is trained with only few hundred labeled sentences and does not rely on furtherexternal knowledge. We report from our results F1 scores in the range of 84-94% onstandard datasets.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1608.06757,2016,3
INDREX: in-database distributional relation extraction,Torsten Kilias; Alexander Löser; Periklis Andritsos,Abstract Relation extraction transforms the textual representation of a relationship into therelational model of a data warehouse. Early systems; such as SystemT by IBM or the opensource system GATE solve this task with handcrafted rule sets that the system executesdocument-by-document. Thereby the user must execute a highly interactive and iterativeprocess of reading a document; of expressing rules; of testing these rules on the nextdocument and of refining rules. Until now; these systems do neither leverage the fullpotential of built-in declarative query languages nor the indexing and query optimizationtechniques of a modern RDBMS that would enable a user interactive rule refinement acrossdocuments and on the entire corpus. We propose the INDREX system that enables a userfor the first time to describe corpus-wide extraction tasks in a declarative language and …,Proceedings of the sixteenth international workshop on Data warehousing and OLAP,2013,3
Fact-aware document retrieval for information extraction,Christoph Boden; Alexander Löser; Christoph Nagel; Stephan Pieper,Abstract Exploiting textual information from large document collections such as the Web withstructured queries is an often requested; but still unsolved requirement of many users. Wepresent BlueFact; a framework for efficiently retrieving documents containing structured;factual information from a full-text index. This is an essential building block for informationextraction systems that enable ad-hoc analytical queries on unstructured text data as well asknowledge harvesting in a digital archive scenario. Our approach is based on theobservation that documents share a set of common grammatical structures and words forexpressing facts. Our system observes these keyword phrases using structural; syntactic;lexical and semantic features in an iterative; cost effective training process andsystematically queries the search engine index with these automatically generated …,Datenbank-Spektrum,2012,3
Beyond search: Web-scale business analytics,Alexander Löser,Abstract We discuss the novel problem of supporting analytical business intelligencequeries over web-based textual content; eg; BI-style reports based on 100.000's ofdocuments from an ad-hoc web search result. Neither conventional search engines norconventional Business Intelligence and ETL tools address this problem; which lies at theintersection of their capabilities. This application is an exciting challenge that should appealto and benefit from several research communities; most notably; the database; text analyticsand distributed system worlds. Eg; to provide fast answers for such queries; cloud computingtechniques need to be incorporated with text analytics; data cleansing; query processingand query refinement methods. However; the envisioned path for OLAP-style queryprocessing over textual web data may take a long time to mature. Two recent …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2009,3

Analysing errors of open information extraction systems,Rudolf Schneider; Tom Oberhauser; Tobias Klatt; Felix A Gers; Alexander Löser,Abstract: We report results on benchmarking Open Information Extraction (OIE) systemsusing RelVis; a toolkit for benchmarking Open Information Extraction systems. Ourcomprehensive benchmark contains three data sets from the news domain and one data setfrom Wikipedia with overall 4522 labeled sentences and 11243 binary or n-ary OIE relations.In our analysis on these data sets we compared the performance of four popular OIEsystems; ClausIE; OpenIE 4.2; Stanford OpenIE and PredPatt. In addition; we evaluated theimpact of five common error classes on a subset of 749 n-ary tuples. From our deep analysiswe unreveal important research directions for a next generation of OIE systems.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.07499,2017,2
Tasty: Interactive entity linking as-you-type,Sebastian Arnold; Robert Dziuba; Alexander Löser,Abstract We introduce TASTY (Tag-as-you-type); a novel text editor for interactive entitylinking as part of the writing process. Tasty supports the author of a text with complementaryinformation about the mentioned entities shown in a 'live'exploration view. The system isautomatically triggered by keystrokes; recognizes mention boundaries and disambiguatesthe mentioned entities to Wikipedia articles. The author can use seven operators to interactwith the editor and refine the results according to his specific intention while writing. Ourimplementation captures syntactic and semantic context using a robust end-to-end LSTMsequence learner and word embeddings. We demonstrate the applicability of our system inEnglish and German language for encyclopedic or medical text. Tasty is currently beingtested in interactive applications for text production; such as scientific research; news …,Proceedings of COLING 2016; the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: System Demonstrations,2016,2

Challenges and Trends in Information Management.,Karin Kailing; Alexander Löser; Volker Markl,Each annotation produced by the AVATAR IES can be viewed as a structured object with awell-defined type. The overall output of an IES; called an annotation store; is a collection ofsuch objects. Please refer to [Jayram et al. 2006] for a formal definition of an annotationstore. Figure 1 shows a simple annotation store with one document object of type Email andthree annotation objects. Each oval in the figure represents one object and is labeled as A: Bwhere A is the ID of the object and B is the type. The rectangular boxes represent atomicattribute values. In this example the span type S contains a pair of integers begin and endthat store the character offsets of the piece of the text corresponding to the annotation. Forthe purposes of this paper; we assume that every annotation is extracted from a singledocument and that the span is interpreted relative to the text of this document.,Datenbank-Spektrum,2006,2
Resolving common analytical tasks in text databases,Sebastian Arnold; Alexander Löser; Torsten Kilias,Abstract With the convergence of data warehousing; online analytical processing and theSemantic Web; analytical tasks are no longer only designed and executed by experts.Instead; various users expect to query keyword search engines with analytical intentions.One efficient approach to answer these tasks is to leverage the factual information stored inlarge-scale text databases. These systems enable analysts to access unstructured textsources from the Web with structured query languages. The challenge of mapping keywordqueries to structured queries has been approached in various forms. However; thesesystems are not able to detect the underlying intent of a task. Thus; they cannot infer theuser's expectations towards specificity and form of the results. Moreover; a large fraction ofqueries for retrieving analytical results is rare. As a result; services for intent-aware task …,Proceedings of the ACM Eighteenth International Workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP,2015,1

A concept for flexible event-driven invocation of distributed service compositions,Karen Walzer; Jurgen Anke; Alexander Loser; Huaigu Wu,Currently; flexible service compositions are invoked in a centralised manner by processexecution engines. Although this approach is widely used for orchestrating Web services; itlacks scalability and incurs considerable overhead in network communication. This isespecially disadvantageous in scenarios with embedded systems and other resource-constrained devices; mainly due to restrictions in network bandwidth or power supply. Wepresent an application scenario to illustrate the drawbacks of centralised service invocationin these cases. Decentralised invocation mechanisms are a promising approach toovercome these problems. Based on the identification of service composition characteristicsin distributed environments; we propose a decentralised mechanism using events andsubscriptions. This mechanism can be employed for invoking distributed service …,Distributed Computing Systems Workshops; 2007. ICDCSW'07. 27th International Conference on,2007,1
FashionBrain Project: A Vision for Understanding Europe's Fashion Data Universe,Alessandro Checco; Gianluca Demartini; Alexander Löser; Ines Arous; Mourad Khayati; Matthias Dantone; Richard Koopmanschap; Svetlin Stalinov; Martin Kersten; Ying Zhang,Abstract: A core business in the fashion industry is the understanding and prediction ofcustomer needs and trends. Search engines and social networks are at the same time afundamental bridge and a costly middleman between the customer's purchase intention andthe retailer. To better exploit Europe's distinctive characteristics eg; multiple languages;fashion and cultural differences; it is pivotal to reduce retailers' dependence to searchengines. This goal can be achieved by harnessing various data channels (manufacturersand distribution networks; online shops; large retailers; social media; market observers; callcenters; press/magazines etc.) that retailers can leverage in order to gain more insight aboutpotential buyers; and on the industry trends as a whole. This can enable the creation ofnovel on-line shopping experiences; the detection of influencers; and the prediction of …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.09788,2017,*

08391 Group Summary--Mining for Social Serendipity,Alexandre Passant; Ian Mulvany; Peter Mika; Nicolas Maisonneuve; Alexander Löser; Ciro Cattuto; Christian Bizer; Christian Bauckhage; Harith Alani,Abstract A common social problem at an event in which people do not personally know all ofthe other participants is the natural tendency for cliques to form and for discussions to mainlyhappen between people who already know each other. This limits the possibility for peopleto make interesting new acquaintances and acts as a retarding force in the creation of newlinks in the social web. Encouraging users to socialize with people they don't know byrevealing to them hidden surprising links could help to improve the diversity of interactions atan event. The goal of this paper is to propose a method for detecting extit {" surprising"}relationships between people attending an event. By extit {" surprising"} relationship wemean those relationships that are not known a-priori; and that imply shared information notdirectly related with the local context of the event (location; interests; contacts) at which …,Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings,2008,*
