Selecting stars: The k most representative skyline operator,Xuemin Lin; Yidong Yuan; Qing Zhang; Ying Zhang,Skyline computation has many applications including multi-criteria decision making. In thispaper; we study the problem of selecting k skyline points so that the number of points; whichare dominated by at least one of these k skyline points; is maximized. We first present anefficient dynamic programming based exact algorithm in a 2d-space. Then; we show that theproblem is NP-hard when the dimensionality is 3 or more and it can be approximately solvedby a polynomial time algorithm with the guaranteed approximation ratio 1-1/e. To speed-upthe computation; an efficient; scalable; index-based randomized algorithm is developed byapplying the FM probabilistic counting technique. A comprehensive performance evaluationdemonstrates that our randomized technique is very efficient; highly accurate; and scalable.,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007.

Taming verification hardness: an efficient algorithm for testing subgraph isomorphism,Haichuan Shang; Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Graphs are widely used to model complicated data semantics in many applications.In this paper; we aim to develop efficient techniques to retrieve graphs; containing a givenquery graph; from a large set of graphs. Considering the problem of testing subgraphisomorphism is generally NP-hard; most of the existing techniques are based on theframework of filtering-and-verification to reduce the precise computation costs; consequentlyvarious novel feature-based indexes have been developed. While the existing techniqueswork well for small query graphs; the verification phase becomes a bottleneck when thequery graph size increases. Motivated by this; in the paper we firstly propose a novel andefficient algorithm for testing subgraph isomorphism; QuickSI. Secondly; we develop a newfeature-based index technique to accommodate QuickSI in the filtering phase. Our …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,232

Connected substructure similarity search,Haichuan Shang; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Wei Wang,Abstract Substructure similarity search is to retrieve graphs that approximately contain agiven query graph. It has many applications; eg; detecting similar functions among chemicalcompounds. The problem is challenging as even testing subgraph containment between twographs is NP-complete. Hence; existing techniques adopt the filtering-and-verificationframework with the focus on developing effective and efficient techniques to remove non-promising graphs. Nevertheless; existing filtering techniques may be still unable toeffectively remove many" low" quality candidates. To resolve this; in this paper we propose anovel indexing technique; GrafD-Index; to index graphs according to their" distances" tofeatures. We characterize a tight condition under which the distance-based triangularinequality holds.

Stochastic skyline operator,Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema,In many applications involving the multiple criteria optimal decision making; users may oftenwant to make a personal trade-off among all optimal solutions. As a key feature; the skylinein a multi-dimensional space provides the minimum set of candidates for such purposes byremoving all points not preferred by any (monotonic) utility/scoring functions; that is; theskyline removes all objects not preferred by any user no mater how their preferences vary.Driven by many applications with uncertain data; the probabilistic skyline model is proposedto retrieve uncertain objects based on skyline probabilities. Nevertheless; skylineprobabilities cannot capture the preferences of monotonic utility functions. Motivated by this;in this paper we propose a novel skyline operator; namely stochastic skyline.

Nova: A novel and efficient framework for finding subgraph isomorphism mappings in large graphs,Ke Zhu; Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Gaoping Zhu; Wei Wang,Abstract Considerable efforts have been spent in studying subgraph problem. Traditionalsubgraph containment query is to retrieve all database graphs which contain the querygraph g. A variation to that is to find all occurrences of a particular pattern (the query) in alarge database graph. We call it subgraph matching problem. The state of art solution to thisproblem is GADDI.

Ranking uncertain sky: The probabilistic top-k skyline operator,Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Bin Jiang; Jian Pei,Abstract Many recent applications involve processing and analyzing uncertain data. In thispaper; we combine the feature of top-k objects with that of skyline to model the problem oftop-k skyline objects against uncertain data. The problem of efficiently computing top-kskyline objects on large uncertain datasets is challenging in both discrete and continuouscases. In this paper; firstly an efficient exact algorithm for computing the top-k skyline objectsis developed for discrete cases. To address applications where each object may have amassive set of instances or a continuous probability density function; we also develop anefficient randomized algorithm with an ϵ‐approximation guarantee. Moreover; ouralgorithms can be immediately extended to efficiently compute p-skyline; that is; retrievingthe uncertain objects with skyline probabilities above a given threshold.

We havestudied the query processing cost and propose two index construction strategies aimed atoptimizing the performance of different types of data graphs: top-down strategy and bottom-up strategy. Moreover; a novel indexing technique is proposed by effectively merging theindexes of individual data graphs; this not only reduces the index size but also furtherreduces the query processing time.

Ap-tree: Efficiently support continuous spatial-keyword queries over stream,Xiang Wang; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Wei Wang,We investigate the problem of processing a large amount of continuous spatial-keywordqueries over streaming data; which is essential in many applications such as location-basedrecommendation and advertising; thanks to the proliferation of geo-equipped devices andthe ensuing location-based social media applications. For example; a location-based e-coupon system may allow potentially millions of users to register their continuous spatial-keyword queries (eg; interests in nearby sales) by specifying a set of keywords and a spatialregion; the system then delivers each incoming spatial-textual object (eg; a geo-tagged e-coupon) to all the matched queries (ie; users) whose spatial and textual requirements aresatisfied.

Effectively Indexing the Multi-Dimensional Uncertain Objects for Range Searching,Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Qianlu Lin; Xuemin Lin,Abstract The range searching problem is fundamental in a wide spectrum of applicationssuch as radio frequency identification (RFID) networks; location based services (LBS); andglobal position system (GPS). As the uncertainty is inherent in those applications; it is highlydemanded to address the uncertainty in the range search since the traditional techniquescannot be applied due to the inherence difference between the uncertain data andtraditional data. In the paper; we propose a novel indexing structure; named U-Quadtree; toorganize the uncertain objects in a multi-dimensional space such that the range searchingcan be answered efficiently by applying filtering techniques. Particularly; based on someinsights of the range search on uncertain data; we propose a cost model which carefullyconsiders various factors that may impact the performance of the range searching.

SRS: solving c-approximate nearest neighbor queries in high dimensional euclidean space with a tiny index,Yifang Sun; Wei Wang; Jianbin Qin; Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Nearest neighbor searches in high-dimensional space have many importantapplications in domains such as data mining; and multimedia databases. The problem ischallenging due to the phenomenon called" curse of dimensionality". An alternative solutionis to consider algorithms that returns a c-approximate nearest neighbor (c-ANN) withguaranteed probabilities. Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is among the most widelyadopted method; and it achieves high efficiency both in theory and practice. However; it isknown to require an extremely high amount of space for indexing; hence limiting itsscalability. In this paper; we propose several surprisingly simple methods to answer c-ANNqueries with theoretical guarantees requiring only a single tiny index.

BMC: an efficient method to evaluate probabilistic reachability queries,Ke Zhu; Wenjie Zhang; Gaoping Zhu; Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Reachability query is a fundamental problem in graph databases. It answerswhether or not there exists a path between a source vertex and a destination vertex and iswidely used in various applications including road networks; social networks; world wideweb and bioinformatics. In some emerging important applications; uncertainties may beinherent in the graphs. For instance; each edge in a graph could be associated with aprobability to appear. In this paper; we study the reachability problem over such uncertaingraphs in a threshold fashion; namely; to determine if a source vertex could reach adestination vertex with probabilty larger than a user specified probability value t. Findingreachability on uncertain graphs has been proved to be NP-Hard.

Skyline probability over uncertain preferences,Qing Zhang; Pengjie Ye; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang,Abstract Skyline analysis is a key in a wide spectrum of real applications involving multi-criteria optimal decision making. In recent years; a considerable amount of research hasbeen contributed on efficient computation of skyline probabilities over uncertainenvironment. Most studies if not all; assume uncertainty lies only in attribute values. To theextent of our knowledge; only one study addresses the skyline probability computationproblem in scenarios where uncertainty resides in attribute preferences; instead of values.However this study takes a problematic approach by assuming independent objectdominance; which we find is not always true in uncertain preference scenarios. In fact thisassumption has already been shown to be not necessarily true in uncertain value scenarios.Motivated by this; we revisit the skyline probability computation over uncertain …,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,18
Slice: Reviving regions-based pruning for reverse k nearest neighbors queries,Shiyu Yang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang,Given a set of facilities and a set of users; a reverse k nearest neighbors (RkNN) query qreturns every user for which the query facility is one of the k-closest facilities. Due to itsimportance; RkNN query has received significant research attention in the past few years.Almost all of the existing techniques adopt a pruning-and-verification framework. Regions-based pruning and half-space pruning are the two most notable pruning strategies. The half-space based approach prunes a larger area and is generally believed to be superior.Influenced by this perception; almost all existing RkNN algorithms utilize and improve thehalf-space pruning strategy. We observe the weaknesses and strengths of both strategiesand discover that the regions-based pruning has certain strengths that have not beenexploited in the past.

A safe zone based approach for monitoring moving skyline queries,Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Ying Zhang,Abstract Given a set of criterions; an object o dominates another object ó if o is morepreferable than ó according to every criterion. A skyline query returns every object that is notdominated by any other object. In this paper; we study the problem of continuouslymonitoring a moving skyline query where one of the criterions is the distance between theobjects and the moving query. We propose a safe zone based approach to address thechallenge of efficiently updating the results as the query moves. A safe zone is the area suchthat the results of a query remain unchanged as long as the query lies inside this area.Hence; the results are required to be updated only when the query leaves its safe zone.Although the main focus of this paper is to present the techniques for Euclidean distancemetric; the proposed techniques are applicable to any metric distance (eg; Manhattan …,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,17

It is iteratively distilled from the notion that" the similarity between two objects isreinforced by the similarity of their related objects". The existing SimFusion model usuallyexploits the Unified Relationship Matrix (URM) to represent latent relationships amongheterogeneous data; and adopts an iterative paradigm for SimFusion computation.However; due to the row normalization of URM; the traditional SimFusion model mayproduce the trivial solution; worse still; the iterative computation of SimFusion may notensure the global convergence of the solution.

Given a query Q and aquantile φ∈(0; 1]; we firstly study the problem of efficiently computing K nearest objectsbased on a φ-quantile distance (eg median distance) from each object to Q. The secondproblem is to retrieve the K nearest objects to Q based on overall distances in the “bestpopulation”(with a given size specified by φ-quantile) for each object.

I/o efficient core graph decomposition at web scale,Dong Wen; Lu Qin; Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Core decomposition is a fundamental graph problem with a large number of applications.Most existing approaches for core decomposition assume that the graph is kept in memoryof a machine. Nevertheless; many real-world graphs are big and may not reside in memory.In the literature; there is only one work for I/O efficient core decomposition that avoidsloading the whole graph in memory. However; this approach is not scalable to handle biggraphs because it cannot bound the memory size and may load most parts of the graph inmemory. In addition; this approach can hardly handle graph updates. In this paper; we studyI/O efficient core decomposition following a semi-external model; which only allows nodeinformation to be loaded in memory. This model works well in many web-scale graphs.

Given an ad hoc scoring function that assigns a score to a multidimensionalinstance; we want to rank a set of multivalued objects. Different from the existing models ofranking uncertain and probabilistic data; which model an object as a random variable andthe instances of an object are assumed exclusive; we have to capture the coexistence ofinstances here. To tackle the problem; we advocate the semantics of favoring widelypreferred objects instead of majority votes; which is widely used in many elections andcompetitions. Technically; we borrow the idea from Borda Count (BC); a well-recognizedmethod in consensus-based voting systems.

Duplicate-insensitive order statistics computation over data streams,Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Yidong Yuan; Masaru Kitsuregawa; Xiaofang Zhou; Jeffrey Wu Yu,Duplicates in data streams may often be observed by the projection on a subspace and/ormultiple recordings of objects. Without the uniqueness assumption on observed dataelements; many conventional aggregates computation problems need to be furtherinvestigated due to their duplication-sensitive nature.

Efficient computation of range aggregates against uncertain location-based queries,Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Yufei Tao; Wenjie Zhang; Haixun Wang,In many applications; including location-based services; queries may not be precise. In thispaper; we study the problem of efficiently computing range aggregates in a multidimensionalspace when the query location is uncertain. Specifically; for a query point Q whose locationis uncertain and a set S of points in a multidimensional space; we want to calculate theaggregate (eg; count; average and sum) over the subset S'of S such that for each p ϵ S'; Qhas at least probability θ within the distance γ to p. We propose novel; efficient techniques tosolve the problem following the filtering-and-verification paradigm. In particular; two novelfiltering techniques are proposed to effectively and efficiently remove data points fromverification. Our comprehensive experiments based on both real and synthetic datademonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our techniques.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,10

A probabilisticthreshold range aggregate (PTRA) query retrieves summarized information about theuncertain objects satisfying a range query; with respect to a given probability threshold. Thispaper is the first one to address this important type of query. We develop a new indexstructure aU-tree and propose an exact querying algorithm based on aU-tree.

Bring Order into the Samples: A Novel Scalable Method for Influence Maximization,Xiaoyang Wang; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Chen Chen,As a key problem in viral marketing; influence maximization has been extensively studied inthe literature. Given a positive integer k; a social network g and a certain propagation model;it aims to find a set of k nodes that have the largest influence spread. The state-of-the-artmethod IMM is based on the reverse influence sampling (RIS) framework. By using themartingale technique; it greatly outperforms the previous methods in efficiency. However;IMM still has limitations in scalability due to the high overhead of deciding a tight samplesize. In this paper; instead of spending the effort on deciding a tight sample size; we presenta novel bottom-ksketch based RIS framework; namely BKRIS; which brings the order ofsamples into the RIS framework.

Scalable distributed subgraph enumeration,Longbin Lai; Lu Qin; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Lijun Chang; Shiyu Yang,Abstract Subgraph enumeration aims to find all the subgraphs of a large data graph that areisomorphic to a given pattern graph. As the subgraph isomorphism operation iscomputationally intensive; researchers have recently focused on solving this problem indistributed environments; such as MapReduce and Pregel. Among them; the state-of-the-artalgorithm; Twin TwigJoin; is proven to be instance optimal based on a left-deep joinframework. However; it is still not scalable to large graphs because of the constraints in theleft-deep join framework and that each decomposed component (join unit) must be a star. Inthis paper; we propose SEED-a scalable sub-graph enumeration approach in the distributedenvironment. Compared to Twin TwigJoin; SEED returns optimal solution in a generalizedjoin framework without the constraints in Twin TwigJoin.

Specifically;given a set of continuously and rapidly arriving spatio-textual objects; each of which isdescribed by a geo-location and a short text; we aim to accurately estimate the cardinality ofa spatial keyword query on objects seen so far; where a spatial keyword query consists of asearch region and a set of query keywords. To the best of our knowledge; this is the firstwork to address this important problem. We first extend two existing techniques to solve thisproblem; and show their limitations.

Consider that a twig-pattern matching may result in an extremely largenumber of matches in a graph; this may not only confuse users by providing too many resultsbut also lead to high computational costs. In this paper; we study the problem of top-k treepattern matching; that is; given a rooted tree T; compute its top-k matches in a directed graphG based on the twig-pattern matching semantics. We firstly present a novel and optimalenumeration paradigm based on the principle of Lawler's procedure. We show that ourenumeration algorithm runs in O (n T+ log k) time in each round where n T is the number ofnodes in T. Considering that the time complexity to output a match of T is O (n T) and n T≥log k in practice; our enumeration technique is optimal.

Efficient top-k similarity join processing over multi-valued objects,Wenjie Zhang; Liming Zhan; Ying Zhang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin,Abstract The top-k similarity joins have been extensively studied and used in a widespectrum of applications such as information retrieval; decision making; spatial data analysisand data mining. Given two sets of objects \mathcalU and \mathcalV; a top-k similarity joinreturns k pairs of most similar objects from \mathcalU*\mathcalV. In the conventional modelof top-k similarity join processing; an object is usually regarded as a point in a multi-dimensional space and the similarity is measured by some simple distance metrics likeEuclidean distance. However; in many applications an object may be described by multiplevalues (instances) and the conventional model is not applicable since it does not addressthe distributions of object instances.

As the proliferation of geo-social networks; location-aware promotion isbecoming more necessary in real applications. In this paper; we study the distance-awareinfluence maximization (DAIM) problem; which advocates the importance of the distancebetween users and the promoted location. Unlike the traditional influence maximizationproblem; DAIM treats users differently based on their distances from the promoted location.In this situation; the k nodes selected are different when the promoted location varies.

Efficiently computing reverse k furthest neighbors,Shenlu Wang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Dongxi Liu,Given a set of facilities F; a set of users U and a query facility q; a reverse k furthestneighbors (RkFN) query retrieves every user u∈ U for which q is one of its k-furthestfacilities. RkFN query is the natural complement of reverse k-nearest neighbors (RkNN)query that returns every user u for which q is one of its k-nearest facilities. While RkNN queryreturns the users that are highly influenced by a query q; RkFN query aims at finding theusers that are least influenced by a query q. RkFN query has many applications in location-based services; marketing; facility location; clustering; and recommendation systems etc.While there exist several algorithms that answer RkFN query for k= 1; we are the first topropose a solution for arbitrary value of k.

Protecting Location Privacy in Spatial Crowdsourcing using Encrypted Data,Bozhong Liu; Ling Chen; Xingquan Zhu; Ying Zhang; Chengqi Zhang; Weidong Qiu,ABSTRACT In spatial crowdsourcing; spatial tasks are outsourced to a set of workers inproximity of the task locations for efficient assignment. It usually requires workers to disclosetheir locations; which inevitably raises security concerns about the privacy of the workers'locations. In this paper; we propose a secure SC framework based on encryption; whichensures that workers' location information is never released to any party; yet the system canstill assign tasks to workers situated in proximity of each task's location. We solve thechallenge of assigning tasks based on encrypted data using homomorphic encryption.Moreover; to overcome the efficiency issue; we propose a novel secure indexing techniquewith a newly devised SKD-tree to index encrypted worker locations.

When engagement meets similarity: efficient (k; r)-core computation on social networks,Fan Zhang; Ying Zhang; Lu Qin; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract In this paper; we investigate the problem of (k; r)-core which intends to find cohesivesubgraphs on social networks considering both user engagement and similarityperspectives. In particular; we adopt the popular concept of k-core to guarantee theengagement of the users (vertices) in a group (subgraph) where each vertex in a (k; r)-coreconnects to at least k other vertices. Meanwhile; we consider the pairwise similarity amongusers based on their attributes. Efficient algorithms are proposed to enumerate all maximal(k; r)-cores and find the maximum (k; r)-core; where both problems are shown to be NP-hard.Effective pruning techniques substantially reduce the search space of two algorithms. Anovel (k; k')-core based (k; r)-core size upper bound enhances performance of the maximum(k; r)-core computation.

Leveraging set relations in exact set similarity join,Xubo Wang; Lu Qin; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Lijun Chang,Abstract Exact set similarity join; which finds all the similar set pairs from two collections ofsets; is a fundamental problem with a wide range of applications. The existing solutions forset similarity join follow a filtering-verification framework; which generates a list of candidatepairs through scanning indexes in the filtering phase; and reports those similar pairs in theverification phase. Though much research has been conducted on this problem; setrelations; which we find out is quite effective on improving the algorithm efficiency throughcomputational cost sharing; have never been studied. Therefore; in this paper; instead ofconsidering each set individually; we explore the set relations in different levels to reducethe overall computational costs. First; it has been shown that most of the computational timeis spent on the filtering phase; which can be quadratic to the number of sets in the worst …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,1
Finding Critical Users for Social Network Engagement: The Collapsed k-Core Problem,Fan Zhang; Ying Zhang; Lu Qin; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract In social networks; the leave of critical users may significantly break networkengagement; ie; lead a large number of other users to drop out. A popular model to measuresocial network engagement is k-core; the maximal induced subgraph in which every vertexhas at least k neighbors. To identify critical users for social network engagement; wepropose the collapsed k-core problem: given a graph G; a positive integer k and a budget b;we aim to find b vertices in G such that the deletion of the b vertices leads to the smallest k-core. We prove the problem is NP-hard. Then; an efficient algorithm is proposed; whichsignificantly reduces the number of candidate vertices to speed up the computation.

Almostall of the existing techniques to answer R k NN queries adopt a pruning-and-verificationframework. Regions-based pruning and half-space pruning are the two most notablepruning strategies. The half-space-based approach prunes a larger area and is generallybelieved to be superior. Influenced by this perception; almost all existing R k NN algorithmsutilize and improve the half-space pruning strategy. We observe the weaknesses andstrengths of both strategies and discover that the regions-based pruning has certainstrengths that have not been exploited in the past.

Selecting Representative Objects Considering Coverage and Diversity,Shenlu Wang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract We say that an object o attracts a user u if o is one of the top-k objects according tothe preference function defined by u. Given a set of objects (eg; restaurants) and a set ofusers; in this paper; we study the problem of computing a set of representative objectsconsidering two criteria: coverage and diversity. Coverage of a set S of objects is the distinctnumber of users that are attracted by the objects in S. Although a set of objects with highcoverage attracts a large number of users; it is possible that all of these users have quitesimilar preferences. Consequently; the set of objects may be attractive only for a specificclass of users with similar preference functions which may disappoint other users havingwidely different preferences. The diversity criterion addresses this issue by selecting a set Sof objects such that the set of attracted users for each object in S is as different as …,Second International ACM Workshop on Managing and Mining Enriched Geo-Spatial Data,2015,1
Optimal Spatial Dominance: An Effective Search of Nearest Neighbor Candidates,Xiaoyang Wang; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Muhammad Aamir Cheema,Abstract In many domains such as computational geometry and database management; anobject may be described by multiple instances (points). Then the distance (or similarity)between two objects is captured by the pair-wise distances among their instances. In thepast; numerous nearest neighbor (NN) functions have been proposed to define the distancebetween objects with multiple instances and to identify the NN object. Nevertheless;considering that a user may not have a specific NN function in mind; it is desirable to provideher with a set of NN candidates. Ideally; the set of NN candidates must include every objectthat is NN for at least one of the NN functions and must exclude every non-promising object.However; no one has studied the problem of NN candidates computation from thisperspective. Although some of the existing works aim at returning a set of candidate …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,1
Probabilistic k-skyband operator over sliding windows,Xing Feng; Wenjie Zhang; Xiang Zhao; Ying Zhang; Yunjun Gao,Abstract Given a set of data elements \mathcalD in ad-dimensional space; ak-skyband queryreports the set of elements which are dominated by at most k− 1 other elements in\mathcalD. k-skyband query is a fundamental query type in data analyzing as it keeps aminimum candidate set for all top-k ranking queries where the ranking functions aremonotonic. In this paper; we study the problem of k-skyband over uncertain data streamsfollowing the possible world semantics where each data element is associated with anoccurrence probability. Firstly; a dynamic programming based algorithm is proposed toidentify k-skyband results for a given set of uncertain elements regarding a pre-specifiedprobability threshold. Secondly; we characterize the minimum set of elements to be kept inthe sliding window to guarantee correct computing of k-skyband. Thirdly; efficient update …,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2013,1
Uncertain Location based Range Aggregates in a multi-dimensional space,Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Yufei Tao; Wenjie Zhang,Uncertain data are inherent in many applications such as environmental surveillance andquantitative economics research. Recently; considerable research efforts have been put intothe field of analysing uncertain data. In this paper; we study the problem of processing theuncertain location based range aggregate in a multi-dimensional space. We first formallyintroduce the problem; then propose a general filtering-and-verification framework to solvethe problem. Two filtering techniques; named STF and PCR respectively; are proposed tosignificantly reduce the verification cost.,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,1
Online Product Quantization,Donna Xu; Ivor W Tsang; Ying Zhang,Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search has achieved great success in manytasks. However; existing popular methods for ANN search; such as hashing andquantization methods; are designed for static databases only. They cannot handle well thedatabase with data distribution evolving dynamically; due to the high computational effort forretraining the model based on the new database. In this paper; we address the problem bydeveloping an online product quantization (online PQ) model and incrementally updatingthe quantization codebook that accommodates to the incoming streaming data. Moreover; tofurther alleviate the issue of large scale computation for the online PQ update; we designtwo budget constraints for the model to update partial PQ codebook instead of all. We derivea loss bound which guarantees the performance of our online PQ model. Furthermore; we …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.10775,2017,*
Efficient Matrix Sketching over Distributed Data,Zengfeng Huang; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Ying Zhang,Abstract A sketch or synopsis of a large dataset captures vital properties of the original datawhile typically occupying much less space. In this paper; we consider the problem ofcomputing a sketch of a massive data matrix A∈ ℜ nxd; which is distributed across a largenumber of s servers. Our goal is to output a matrix B∈ ℜ ℓ xd which is significantly smallerthan but still approximates A well in terms of covariance error; ie;|| AT AB TB|| 2||. Here; for amatrix A;|| A|| 2|| is the spectral norm of A; which is defined as the largest singular value of A.Following previous works; we call B a covariance sketch of A. We are mainly focused onminimizing the communication cost; which is arguably the most valuable resource indistributed computations. We show a gap between deterministic and randomizedcommunication complexity for computing a covariance sketch. More specifically; we first …,Proceedings of the 36th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2017,*
TT-Join: Efficient Set Containment Join,Jianye Yang; Wenjie Zhang; Shiyu Yang; Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin,In this paper; we study the problem of set containment join. Given two collections R and S ofrecords; the set containment join R./S retrieves all record pairs f (r; s) g 2 RS such that r s.This problem has been extensively studied in the literature and has many importantapplications in commercial and scientific fields. Recent research focuses on the in-memoryset containment join algorithms; and several techniques have been developed followingintersectionoriented or union-oriented computing paradigms. Nevertheless; we observe thattwo computing paradigms have their limits due to the nature of the intersection and unionoperators. Particularly; intersection-oriented method relies on the intersection of the relevantinverted lists built on the elements of S. A nice property of the intersection-oriented method isthat the join computation is verification free. However; the number of records explored …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,*
Enumerating k-Vertex Connected Components in Large Graphs,Dong Wen; Lu Qin; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Lijun Chang,Abstract: Cohesive subgraph detection is an important graph problem that is widely appliedin many application domains; such as social community detection; network visualization;and network topology analysis. Most of existing cohesive subgraph metrics can guaranteegood structural properties but may cause the free-rider effect. Here; by free-rider effect; wemean that some irrelevant subgraphs are combined as one subgraph if they only share asmall number of vertices and edges. In this paper; we study k-vertex connected component(k-VCC) which can effectively eliminate the free-rider effect but less studied in the literature.A k-VCC is a connected subgraph in which the removal of any k-1 vertices will notdisconnect the subgraph. In addition to eliminating the free-rider effect; k-VCC also has otheradvantages such as bounded diameter; high cohesiveness; bounded graph overlapping …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.08668,2017,*
SKPS: Towards Efficient Processing of Spatial-Keyword Publish/Subscribe System,Xiang Wang; Shiyu Yang; Ying Zhang,Abstract With the popularity of geo-equipped devices and location-based services; spatial-keyword publish/subscribe has emerged as a very important framework to disseminate real-time messages (eg; geo-tagged e-coupon) to registered subscriptions (eg; users interestedin nearby promotions). While there are several work focusing on improving the efficiency ofspatial-keyword publish/subscribe; their techniques fail to consider both the spatial andkeyword distributions in a fine manner; thus lacking of scalability when coping with massivesubscriptions. In this demonstration; we propose SKPS; a centralized in-memory spatial-keyword publish/subscribe system; which exploits fully the spatial and keyword distributionsof subscription workload during indexing construction; and employs an efficient messagematching algorithm to disseminate each incoming message to relevant subscriptions in a …,Australasian Database Conference,2016,*
EDMS: A System for Efficient Processing Distance-Aware Influence Maximization,Xiaoyang Wang; Chen Chen; Ying Zhang,Abstract As a key problem in viral marketing; influence maximization has been widelystudied in the literature. It aims to find a set of k users in a social network; which canmaximize the influence spread under a certain propagation model. With the proliferation ofgeo-social networks; location-aware promotion is becoming more and more necessary inreal applications. However; the importance of the distance between users and the promotedlocations is underestimated in the existing work. For example; when promoting a local store;the owner may prefer to influence more people that are close to the store instead of peoplethat are far away. In this demonstration; we propose EDMS; a centralized system thatefficiently processes the distance-aware influence maximization problem. To meet the onlinerequirements; we combine different pruning strategies and the best first search algorithm …,Australasian Database Conference,2016,*
Influence based cost optimization on user preference,Jianye Yang; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin,The popularity of e-business and preference learning techniques have contributed a hugeamount of product and user preference data. Analyzing the influence of an existing or newproduct among the users is critical to unlock the great scientific and social-economic value ofthese data. In this paper; we advocate the problem of influence-based cost optimization forthe user preference and product data; which is fundamental in many real applications suchas marketing and advertising. Generally; we aim to find a cost optimal position for a newproduct such that it can attract at least k or a particular percentage of users for the given userpreference functions and competitors' products. Although we show the solution space of ourproblem can be reduced to a finite number of possible positions (points) by utilizing theclassical k-level computation techniques; the computation cost is still very expensive due …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,*
AVR-Tree: Speeding Up the NN and ANN Queries on Location Data,Qianlu Lin; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract In the paper; we study the problems of nearest neighbor queries (NN) and allnearest neighbor queries (ANN) on location data; which have a wide range of applicationssuch as Geographic Information System (GIS) and Location based Service (LBS). Wepropose a new structure; termed AVR-Tree; based on the R-tree and Voronoi diagramtechniques. Compared with the existing indexing techniques used for NN and ANN querieson location data; AVR-Tree can achieve a better trade-off between the pruning effectivenessand the index size for NN and ANN queries. We also conduct a comprehensive performanceevaluation for the proposed techniques based on both real and synthetic data; which showsthat AVR-Tree based NN and ANN algorithms achieve better performance compared withtheir best competitors in terms of both CPU and I/O costs.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2013,*

Duplicate-insensitive Order Statistics Computation over Data Streams,Ying Zhang1 Xuemin Lin; Yidong Yuan; Masaru Kitsuregawa; Xiaofang Zhou3 Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract—Duplicates in data streams may often be observed by the projection on asubspace and/or multiple recordings of objects. Without the uniqueness assumption onobserved data elements; many conventional aggregates computation problems need to befurther investigated due to their duplication sensitive nature. In this paper; we present novel;space-efficient; one-scan algorithms to continuously maintain duplicate insensitive ordersketches so that rank-based queries can be approximately processed with a relative rankerror guarantee ǫ in the presence of data duplicates. Besides the space efficiency; theproposed algorithms are time-efficient and highly accurate. Moreover; our techniques maybe immediately applied to the heavy hitter problem against distinct elements and to theexisting fault-tolerant distributed communication techniques.
