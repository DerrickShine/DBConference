Lazy query evaluation for Active XML,Serge Abiteboul; Omar Benjelloun; Bogdan Cautis; Ioana Manolescu; Tova Milo; Nicoleta Preda,Abstract In this paper; we study query evaluation on Active XML documents (AXML for short);a new generation of XML documents that has recently gained popularity. AXML documentsare XML documents whose content is given partly extensionally; by explicit data elements;and partly intensionally; by embedded calls to Web services; which can be invoked togenerate data. A major challenge in the efficient evaluation of queries over such documentsis to detect which calls may bring data that is relevant for the query execution; and to avoidthe materialization of irrelevant information. The problem is intricate; as service calls may beembedded anywhere in the document; and service invocations possibly return datacontaining calls to new services. Hence; the detection of relevant calls becomes acontinuous process. Also; a good analysis must take the service signatures into …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,133
XPath Rewriting Using Multiple Views: Achieving Completeness and Efficiency.,Bogdan Cautis; Alin Deutsch; Nicola Onose,ABSTRACT The standard approach for optimization of XPath queries by rewriting usingviews techniques consists in navigating inside a view's output; thus allowing the usage ofonly one view in the rewritten query. Algorithms for richer classes of XPath rewritings; usingintersection or joins on node identifiers; have been proposed; but they either lackcompleteness guarantees; or require additional information about the data. We identify thetightest restrictions under which an XPath can be rewritten in polynomial time using anintersection of views and propose an algorithm that works for any documents or type ofidentifiers. As an additional contribution; we analyze the complexity of the related problem ofdeciding if an XPath with intersection can be equivalently rewritten as one withoutintersection or union.,WebDB,2008,52
Building a signed network from interactions in Wikipedia,Silviu Maniu; Bogdan Cautis; Talel Abdessalem,Abstract We present in this paper results on inferring a signed network (a" web of trust") frominteractions on user-generated content in Wikipedia. From a collection of articles in thepolitics domain and their revision history; we investigate mechanisms by which relationshipsbetween Wikipedia contributors-in the form of signed directed links-can be inferred basedtheir interactions. Our study sheds light into principles underlying a signed network that iscaptured by social interaction. We look into whether this network over Wikipedia contributorsrepresents indeed a plausible configuration of link signs. We assess connections to socialtheories such as structural balance and status; which have already been considered inonline communities. We also evaluate on this network the accuracy of a learned predictor foredge signs.

Network-aware search in social tagging applications: instance optimality versus efficiency,Silviu Maniu; Bogdan Cautis,Abstract We consider in this paper top-k query answering in social applications; with a focuson social tagging. This problem requires a significant departure from socially agnostictechniques. In a network-aware context; one can (and should) exploit the social links; whichcan indicate how users relate to the seeker and how much weight their tagging actionsshould have in the result build-up. We propose algorithms that have the potential to scale tocurrent applications. While the problem has already been considered in previous literature;this was done either under strong simplifying assumptions or under choices that cannotscale to even moderate-size real-world applications. We first revisit a key aspect of theproblem; which is accessing the closest or most relevant users for a given seeker. Wedescribe how this can be done on the fly (without any pre-computations) for several …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,34
An electronic patient record" on steroids": distributed; peer-to-peer; secure and privacy-conscious,Serge Abiteboul; Bogdan Alexe; Omar Benjelloun; Bogdan Cautis; Irini Fundulaki; Tova Milo; Arnaud Sahuguet,Getting sick or injured is never a good idea. You never know when it's going to happen orwhere. In such situations; it is crucial to be able to gather all the relevant information to makethe diagnosis and treatment as effective as possible. By nature; an electronic patient record(EPR)[9] consists of many pieces owned and managed by different entities: yourself as apatient; your referring doctor; the various specialists you are dealing with (eg gynecologist;optometrist; physical therapist); the pharmacist (s) you shop from; the various hospitals yougo to for surgery or special examination; the insurance company (private or state-owned)that handles the billing and reimbursement; some wearable devices that monitor yourheartbeat or glucose level; etc. Besides the distribution of the data; one of the mainchallenges in the management of EPR information is its sensitive nature.

Complete yet practical search for minimal query reformulations under constraints,Ioana Ileana; Bogdan Cautis; Alin Deutsch; Yannis Katsis,Abstract We revisit the Chase&Backchase (C&B) algorithm for query reformulation underconstraints; which provides a uniform solution to such particular-case problems as view-based rewriting under constraints; semantic query optimization; and physical access pathselection in query optimization. For an important class of queries and constraints; C&B hasbeen shown to be complete; ie guaranteed to find all (join-) minimal reformulations underconstraints. C&B is based on constructing a canonical rewriting candidate called a universalplan; then inspecting its exponentially many sub-queries in search for minimalreformulations; essentially removing redundant joins in all possible ways. This inspectioninvolves chasing the subquery. Because of the resulting exponentially many chases; theconventional wisdom has held that completeness is a concept of mainly theoretical …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,24
Reasoning about XML update constraints,Bogdan Cautis; Serge Abiteboul; Tova Milo,Abstract We introduce in this paper a class of constraints for describing how an XMLdocument can evolve; namely XML update constraints. For these constraints; we study theimplication problem; giving algorithms and complexity results for constraints of varyingexpressive power. Besides classical constraint implication; we also consider an instance-based approach in which we take into account data. More precisely; we study implicationwith respect to a current tree instance; resulting from a series of unknown updates. The mainmotivation of our work is reasoning about data integrity under update restrictions in contextswhere owners may lose control over their data; such as in publishing or exchange.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2009,23
Efficient rewriting of XPath queries using query set specifications,Bogdan Cautis; Alin Deutsch; Nicola Onose; Vasilis Vassalos,Abstract We study the problem of querying XML data sources that accept only a limited set ofqueries; such as sources accessible by Web services which can implement very large(potentially infinite) families of XPath queries. To compactly specify such families of querieswe adopt the Query Set Specifications [14]; a formalism close to context-free grammars. Wesay that query Q is expressible by the specification P if it is equivalent to some expansion ofP. Q is supported by P if it has an equivalent rewriting using some finite set of P'sexpansions. We study the complexity of expressibility and support and identify large classesof XPath queries for which there are efficient (PTIME) algorithms.

Automatic extraction of structured web data with domain knowledge,Nora Derouiche; Bogdan Cautis; Talel Abdessalem,We present in this paper a novel approach for extracting structured data from the Web;whose goal is to harvest real-world items from template-based HTML pages (the structuredWeb). It illustrates a two-phase querying of the Web; in which an intentional description ofthe data that is targeted is first provided; in a flexible and widely applicable manner. Theextraction process leverages then both the input description and the source structure. Ourapproach is domain-independent; in the sense that it applies to any relation; either flat ornested; describing real-world items. Extensive experiments on five different domains andcomparison with the main state of the art extraction systems from literature illustrate itsflexibility and precision.

Taagle: Efficient; personalized search in collaborative tagging networks,Silviu Maniu; Bogdan Cautis,Abstract We demonstrate the Taagle system for top-k retrieval in social tagging systems(also known as folksonomies). The general setting is the following: users form a weightedsocial network; which may reflect friendship; similarity; or trust; items from a public pool ofitems (eg; URLs; blogs; photos; documents) are tagged by users with keywords; userssearch for the top-k items having certain tags. Going beyond a classic search paradigmwhere data is decoupled from the users querying it; users can now act both as producersand seekers of information. Hence finding the most relevant items in response to a queryshould be done in a network-aware manner: items tagged by users who are closer (moresimilar) to the seeker should be given more weight than items tagged by distant users. Weillustrate with Taagle novel algorithms and a general approach that has the potential to …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,17
ObjectRunner: lightweight; targeted extraction and querying of structured web data,Talel Abdessalem; Bogdan Cautis; Nora Derouiche,Abstract We present in this paper ObjectRunner; a system for extracting; integrating andquerying structured data from the Web. Our system harvests real-world items from template-based HTML pages (the so-called structured Web). It illustrates a two-phase querying of theWeb; in which an intentional description of the targeted data is first provided; in a flexibleand widely applicable manner. ObjectRunner follows then a lightweight; best-effortapproach; leveraging both the input description and the source structure. This process isdomain-independent; in the sense that it applies to any relation; either flat or nested;describing real-world items. We advocate via our prototype that fully automatic extractionand integration of structured data can be done fast and effectively; when the redundancy ofthe Web meets knowledge over the to-be-extracted data.

Trust management in social networks,Talel Abdessalem; Bogdan Cautis; Asma Souhli,The web 2.0 enables users to get information; obtain services and communicate with othersin new ways. As a consequence; it reconfigures access not only to information and servicesbut also to people: who a user knows; trusts and stays in touch with. Some of the mostexciting new activity on the web is social; with social networks and collaborative interaction.In a few words; these are applications that allow users to share items (such as photos;movies; documents; bookmarks; scientific citations; blog pages; slides; and so forth) and toassign descriptive terms from an uncontrolled vocabulary (denoted tags) to items of theirinterest. The open and decentralized nature of the web raises challenging issues such asthe protection of rational users against malicious ones.

Pruning nested XQuery queries,Bilel Gueni; Talel Abdessalem; Bogdan Cautis; Emmanuel Waller,Abstract We present in this paper an approach for XQuery optimization that exploitsminimization opportunities raised in composition-style nesting of queries. More precisely; weconsider the simplification of XQuery queries in which the intermediate result constructed bya subexpression is queried by another subexpression. Based on a large subset of XQuery;we describe a rule-based algorithm that recursively prunes query expressions; eliminatinguseless intermediate results. Our algorithm takes as input an XQuery expression that mayhave navigation within its subexpressions and outputs a simplified; equivalent XQueryexpression; and is thus readily usable as an optimization module in any existing XQueryprocessor. We demonstrate by experiments the impact of our rewriting approach on queryevaluation costs and we prove formally its correctness.,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,11
Distributed access control: A privacy-conscious approach,Bogdan Cautis,Abstract With more and more information being exchanged or published on the Web or inpeer-to-peer; and with the significant growth in numbers of distributed; heterogeneous datasources; issues like access control and data privacy are becoming increasingly complex anddifficult to manage. Very often; when dealing with sensitive information in such settings; thespecification of access control policies and their enforcement are no longer handled by theactual data sources; and are (partially) delegated to third-parties. Besides practical reasons;this is the case when decisions regarding access depend on factors which overpass thescope and knowledge of some of the entities involved. More specifically; policies maydepend on private aspects concerning users (accessing data) or data owners. In this case;the only solution is to entrust some third-party authority with all the information needed to …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2007,11
Lotusx: a position-aware xml graphical search system with auto-completion,Chunbin Lin; Jiaheng Lu; Tok Wang Ling; Bogdan Cautis,The existing query languages for XML (eg; XQuery) require professional programming skillsto be formulated; however; such complex query languages burden the query processing. Inaddition; when issuing an XML query; users are required to be familiar with the content(including the structural and textual information) of the hierarchical XML; which is diffcult forcommon users. The need for designing user friendly interfaces to reduce the burden ofquery formulation is fundamental to the spreading of XML community. We present a twig-based XML graphical search system; called LotusX; that provides a graphical interface tosimplify the query processing without the need of learning query language and dataschemas and the knowledge of the content of the XML document. The basic idea is thatLotusX proposes" position-aware" and" auto-completion" features to help users to create …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,7
Active XML; Security and Access Control.,Serge Abiteboul; Omar Benjelloun; Bogdan Cautis; Tova Milo; SA Xyleme,Abstract XML and Web services are revolutioning the automatic management of distributedinformation; somewhat in the same way that HTML; Web browsers and search enginesmodified human access to world wide information. We argue in this paper that thecombination of XML and Web services allows for a novel distributed data managementparadigm; where the exchanged information mixes materialized and intensional; active;information. We illustrate the flexibility of this approach by presenting Active XML; alanguage that is based on embedding Web service calls in XML data. We focus on twoparticular issues; namely security and access control.,SBBD,2004,7
Kb-enabled query recommendation for long-tail queries,Zhipeng Huang; Bogdan Cautis; Reynold Cheng; Yudian Zheng,Abstract In recent years; query recommendation algorithms have been designed to providerelated queries for search engine users. Most of these solutions; which perform extensiveanalysis of users' search history (or query logs); are largely insufficient for long-tail queriesthat rarely appear in query logs. To handle such queries; we study a new solution; whichmakes use of a knowledge base (or KB); such as YAGO and Freebase. A KB is a richinformation source that describes how real-world entities are connected. We extract entitiesfrom a query; and use these entities to explore new ones in the KB. Those discoveredentities are then used to suggest new queries to the user. As shown in our experiments; ourapproach provides better recommendation results for long-tail queries than existingsolutions.,Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2016,6

Digital signatures for modifiable collections,Serge Abiteboul; Bogdan Cautis; Amos Fiat; Tova Milo,The common assumption about digital signatures is that they disallow any kind ofmodification on signed data. However; a more flexible approach is often needed and hasbeen advocated lately; one in which some restricted modifications may still occur; withoutinvalidating the data. This is made possible by offering signatures which are homomorphicwith respect to some operation on the message domain. Starting from the signature (s) ofsome data instance (s); computed by the data owner; anybody else can derive the signaturecorresponding to a new data instance; if obtained only via some accepted operation from theprevious one (s). More; updated signatures should be indistinguishable from the onescomputed by the data owner and this updating step should be applicable as many times asneeded.

Social; Structured; and Semantic Search,Raphaël Bonaque; Bogdan Cautis; François Goasdoué; Ioana Manolescu,Social content such as blogs; tweets; news etc. is a rich source of interconnectedinformation. We identify a set of requirements for the meaningful exploitation of such richcontent; and present a new data model; called S3; which is the first to satisfy them. S3captures social relationships between users; and between users and content; but also thestructure present in rich social content; as well as its semantics. We provide the first top-kkeyword search algorithm taking into account the social; structured; and semanticdimensions and formally establish its termination and correctness. Experiments on realsocial networks demonstrate the efficiency and qualitative advantage of our algorithmthrough the joint exploitation of the social; structured; and semantic dimensions of S3.,*,2015,3
Answering queries using views over probabilistic XML: complexity and tractability,Bogdan Cautis; Evgeny Kharlamov,Abstract We study the complexity of query answering using views in a probabilistic XMLsetting; identifying large classes of XPath queries--with child and descendant navigation andpredicates--for which there are efficient (PTime) algorithms. We consider this problem underthe two possible semantics for XML query results: with persistent node identifiers and in theirabsence. Accordingly; we consider rewritings that can exploit a single view; by means ofcompensation; and rewritings that can use multiple views; by means of intersection. Since ina probabilistic setting queries return answers with probabilities; the problem of rewritinggoes beyond the classic one of retrieving XML answers from views. For both semantics ofXML queries; we show that; even when XML answers can be retrieved from views; theirprobabilities may not be computable. For rewritings that use only compensation; we …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,3

Context-aware top-k processing using views,Silviu Maniu; Bogdan Cautis,Abstract Search applications where queries are dependent on their context are becomingincreasingly relevant in today's online applications. For example; the context may be thelocation of the user in location-aware search or the social network of the query initiator insocial-aware search. Processing such queries efficiently is inherently difficult; and requirestechniques that go beyond the existing; context-agnostic ones. A promising direction forefficient; online answering--especially in the case of top-k queries--is to materialize andexploit previous query results (views). We consider context-aware query optimization basedon views; focusing on two important sub-problems. First; handling the possible differences incontext between the various views and an input query leads to view results having uncertainscores; ie; score ranges valid for the new context. As a consequence; current top-k …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,2
Effective large-scale online influence maximization,Paul Lagrée; Olivier Cappé; Bogdan Cautis; Silviu Maniu,Abstract—In this paper; we study a highly generic version of influence maximization (IM);one of optimizing influence campaigns by sequentially selecting “spread seeds” from a set ofcandidates; a small subset of the node population; under the hypothesis that; in a givencampaign; previously activated nodes remain “persistently” active throughout and thus donot yield further rewards. We call this problem online influence maximization withpersistence. We introduce an estimator on the candidates' missing mass–the expectednumber of nodes that can still be reached from a given seed candidate–and justify itsstrength to rapidly estimate the desired value. We then describe a novel algorithm; GT-UCB;relying on upper confidence bounds on the missing mass. We show that our approach leadsto high-quality spreads on classic IM datasets; even though it makes almost no …,International Conference on Data Mining,2017,1

Quantifying trust dynamics in signed graphs; the S-Cores approach,Christos Giatsidis; Bogdan Cautis; Silviu Maniu; Dimitrios M Thilikos; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Abstract Lately; there has been an increased interest in signed networks with applications intrust; security; or social computing. This paper focuses on the issue of defining models andmetrics for reciprocity in signed graphs. In unsigned directed networks; reciprocity quantifiesthe predisposition of network members in creating mutual connections. On the other hand;this concept has not yet been investigated in the case of signed graphs. We capitalize on thegraph degeneracy concept to identify subgraphs of the signed network in which reciprocity ismore likely to occur. This enables us to assess reciprocity at a global level; rather than at anexclusively local one as in existing approaches. The large scale experiments we perform onreal world data sets of trust networks lead to both interesting and intuitive results. We believethese reciprocity measures can be used in various social applications such as trust …,*,2014,1

It has many applications in advertising and marketingon social networks. In this paper; we study the problem of sequentially selecting seeds in thenetwork under the hypothesis that previously activated nodes can still transfer information;but do not yield further rewards. Furthermore; we make no assumption on the underlyingdiffusion model. We refer to this problem as online influence maximization with persistence.We first discuss scenarios motivating the problem and present our approach to solve it.

Toward Social; Structured and Semantic Search,Raphaël Bonaque; Bogdan Cautis; François Goasdoué; Ioana Manolescu,Social content such as social network posts; tweets; news articles and more generally webpage fragments is often structured. Such social content is also frequently enriched withannotations; most of which carry semantics; either by collaborative effort or from automatictools.

Rewriting XPath Queries using View Intersections: Tractability versus Completeness,Bogdan Cautis; Alin Deutsch; Ioana Ileana; Nicola Onose,Abstract: The standard approach for optimization of XPath queries by rewriting using viewstechniques consists in navigating inside a view's output; thus allowing the usage of only oneview in the rewritten query. Algorithms for richer classes of XPath rewritings; usingintersection or joins on node identifiers; have been proposed; but they either lackcompleteness guarantees; or require additional information about the data. We identify thetightest restrictions under which an XPath can be rewritten in polynomial time using anintersection of views and propose an algorithm that works for any documents or type ofidentifiers. As a side-effect; we analyze the complexity of the related problem of deciding ifan XPath with intersection can be equivalently rewritten as one without intersection or union.We extend our formal study of the view-based rewriting problem for XPath by describing …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1308.5585,2013,*

XPath rewriting using views: the more the merrier,Bogdan Cautis,Abstract We report in this talk on recent results on richer classes of XPath rewritings usingviews. The problem of equivalently rewriting queries using views is fundamental to severalclassical data management tasks. Examples include query optimization using a cache ofmaterialized results of previous queries and database security; where a query is answeredonly if it has a rewriting using the pre-defined security views.,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2011,*

Signing and reasoning about tree update,Bogdan Cautis,Résumé L'objectif des travaux de recherche présentés dans cette thèse est d'étudier desproblèmes de sécurité et confidentialité qui se posent dans la gestion de données semistructurées distribuées. Si les techniques claniques de signature excluent toute modificationdes données signées; une approche plus souple est souvent nécessaire; dans laquelle desmodifications (d'un type prédéfini) des données protégées par des signatures peuvent seproduire. Dans ce but; nous avons proposé deux modèles.(XML Update Constraints et+/-Annotated Trees) pour spécifier des restrictions de mise à jour pour données XML sensibleset sans contrôle centralisé. Nous avons ensuite considéré des mécanismescryptograpbiques permettant la publication de données avec restrictions de mise à jour.Pour imposer de telles restrictions sans avoir à divulguer l'historique de modifications …,*,2007,*
Les forces résistantes de la tectonique des plaques: apport des données gravimétriques dans les modèles numériques,Yann Krien,Résumé Cette étude a pour principal objectif d'apporter des contraintes sur la structure!mécanique des zones de subduction et sur l'intensité des forces qui s' opposent à latectonique des plaques. A l'aide de modèles dynamiques 2D de zone de subduction;cartésiens et instantanés; avec des rhéologies Newtoniennes ou en loi de puissance; nousmontrons dans une première partie que les données gravimétriques ne peuvent êtrereproduites que si le couplage entre les plaques est limité; et que la résistance de lalithosphère subductante lors de la flexure est relativement faible. La gravité et les anomaliesde géoïde (de longueurs d'ondes comprises entre 100 km et 4000 km environ) sont engénéral correctement reproduites dans le cas où les contraintes déviatoriques sontmodérées. Nos résultats indiquent que seule une petite portion du poids de la plaque …,*,2007,*

architecture for data journalism,R Bonaque; TD Cao; B Cautis; F Goasdoué; J Letelier; I Manolescu; O Mendoza; S Ribeiro; X Tannier; M Thomazo,ABSTRACT As the world's affairs get increasingly more digital; timely production andconsumption of news require to efficiently and quickly exploit heterogeneous data sources.Discussions with journalists revealed that content management tools currently at theirdisposal fall very short of expectations. We demonstrate TATOOINE; a lightweight dataintegration prototype; which allows to quickly set up integration queries across (very)heterogeneous data sources; capitalizing on the many data links (joins) available in thisapplication domain. Our demonstration is based on scenarios we study in collaboration withLe Monde; France's major newspaper.,*,*,*
2012 IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2012),Yang Zhang; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Cliques are topological structures that usually provide important information forunderstanding the structure of a graph or network. However; detecting and extracting cliquesefficiently is known to be very hard. In this paper; we define and introduce the notion of aTriangle K-Core; a simpler topological structure and one that is more tractable and canmoreover be used as a proxy for extracting clique-like...,*,*,*

A Semantic Indexing-based Approach to Top-k Retrieval of Structured Web Sources,Nora Derouiche; Talel Abdessalem; Bogdan Cautis; Aditya Goel,ABSTRACT Techniques that extract information from schematized (structured) Web sources;called wrapper inference techniques; have been extensively studied in the literature. Werecently proposed with the ObjectRunner system a wrapping approach that assumes a priorknowledge over the information that should be targeted; in what could be seen as targetedwrapping and extraction. We exploit a lightweight intensional description of the to-be-extracted data to guide and refine the wrapping process; improving both the precision andperformance of extraction. However; for practical purposes; all existing techniques forwrapper inference; including ours; have one major limitation for practical purposes: theyrequire the to-be-wrapped Web sources to be explicitly provided; as part of the input. Weconsidered in this paper the problem of processing; indexing and selecting Web sources …,*,*,*
Social-Web Archive Contextualization: Cultural Dynamics; Responses to News and Context-aware Social Search,Amin Mantrach; Bogdan Cautis; Alejandro Jaimes; Telecom Paristech,Abstract. In this document; we describe techniques and approaches concerned withsocialweb archive contextualization. In particular; we describe our work on culturaldynamics; which refers to gaining insights into cultural patterns in social media; context-aware social search; and social media mining. We examine the reaction of people in socialmedia to news articles; by developing techniques that could help journalists and curators tosemi-automatically filter the most relevant content. We study social search and proposetechniques to carry it out because it could be a crucial tool in finding relevant information forcurators and journalists.,*,*,*

Challenges of View-Based Query Answering for Probabilistic XML,Bogdan Cautis; Evgeny Kharlamov,Abstract. This paper presents a first study on answering queries using views in aprobabilistic XML setting. We formalize the problem and give a preliminary study of it underthe two possible semantics for XML query results; with persistent node identifiers and in theirabsence. Accordingly; we consider both rewrite plans that rely on a single view; by means ofcompensation; and plans that use multiple views; by means of intersection. Since inprobabilistic settings queries return answers with probabilities; the problem of rewriting goesbeyond the one of retrieving answers from views to retrieving answers together with theirprobabilities. For both semantics of XML results; we show that; even if the answers can beretrieved; the computation of their probabilities might not be possible. We present restrictionsthat make probabilistic rewriting feasible in polynomial time; and we also present some …,*,*,*
