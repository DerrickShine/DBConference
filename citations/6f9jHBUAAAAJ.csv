Protein folding mediated by solvation: water expulsion and formation of the hydrophobic core occur after the structural collapse,Margaret S Cheung; Angel E García; José N Onuchic,Abstract The interplay between structure-search of the native structure and desolvation inprotein folding has been explored using a minimalist model. These results support a foldingmechanism where most of the structural formation of the protein is achieved before water isexpelled from the hydrophobic core. This view integrates water expulsion effects into thefunnel energy landscape theory of protein folding. Comparisons to experimental results areshown for the SH3 protein. After the folding transition; a near-native intermediate withpartially solvated hydrophobic core is found. This transition is followed by a final step thatcooperatively squeezes out water molecules from the partially hydrated protein core.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2002,471
Molecular crowding enhances native state stability and refolding rates of globular proteins,Margaret S Cheung; Dmitri Klimov; D Thirumalai,Abstract The presence of macromolecules in cells geometrically restricts the available spacefor poplypeptide chains. To study the effects of macromolecular crowding on foldingthermodynamics and kinetics; we used an off-lattice model of the all-β-sheet WW domain inthe presence of large spherical particles whose interaction with the polypeptide chain ispurely repulsive. At all volume fractions; ϕ c; of the crowding agents the stability of the nativestate is enhanced. Remarkably; the refolding rates; which are larger than the value at ϕ c= 0;increase nonmonotonically as ϕ c increases; reaching a maximum at Formula. At highvalues of ϕ c; the depletion-induced intramolecular attraction produces compact structureswith considerable structure in the denatured state. Changes in native state stability andfolding kinetics at ϕ c can be quantitatively mapped onto confinement in a volume-fraction …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2005,449
Structure; function; and folding of phosphoglycerate kinase are strongly perturbed by macromolecular crowding,Apratim Dhar; Antonios Samiotakis; Simon Ebbinghaus; Lea Nienhaus; Dirar Homouz; Martin Gruebele; Margaret S Cheung,Abstract We combine experiment and computer simulation to show how macromolecularcrowding dramatically affects the structure; function; and folding landscape ofphosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). Fluorescence labeling shows that compact states of yeastPGK are populated as the amount of crowding agents (Ficoll 70) increases. Coarse-grainedmolecular simulations reveal three compact ensembles: C (crystal structure); CC (collapsedcrystal); and Sph (spherical compact). With an adjustment for viscosity; crowded wild-typePGK and fluorescent PGK are about 15 times or more active in 200 mg/ml Ficoll than inaqueous solution. Our results suggest a previously undescribed solution to the classicproblem of how the ADP and diphosphoglycerate binding sites of PGK come together tomake ATP: Rather than undergoing a hinge motion; the ADP and substrate sites are …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2010,198
Molecular crowding enhances native structure and stability of α/β protein flavodoxin,Loren Stagg; Shao-Qing Zhang; Margaret S Cheung; Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede,Abstract To investigate the consequences of macromolecular crowding on the behavior of aglobular protein; we performed a combined experimental and computational study on the148-residue single-domain α/β protein; Desulfovibrio desulfuricans apoflavodoxin. In vitrothermal unfolding experiments; as well as assessment of native and denatured structures;were probed by using far-UV CD in the presence of various amounts of Ficoll 70; an inertspherical crowding agent. Ficoll 70 has a concentration-dependent effect on the thermalstability of apoflavodoxin (ΔT m of 20 C at 400 mg/ml; pH 7). As judged by CD; addition ofFicoll 70 causes an increase in the amount of secondary structure in the native-stateensemble (pH 7; 20 C) but only minor effects on the denatured state. Theoreticalcalculations; based on an off-lattice model and hard-sphere particles; are in good …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2007,192
Crowded; cell-like environment induces shape changes in aspherical protein,Dirar Homouz; Michael Perham; Antonios Samiotakis; Margaret S Cheung; Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede,Abstract How the crowded environment inside cells affects the structures of proteins withaspherical shapes is a vital question because many proteins and protein–protein complexesin vivo adopt anisotropic shapes. Here we address this question by combiningcomputational and experimental studies of a football-shaped protein (ie; Borrelia burgdorferiVlsE) in crowded; cell-like conditions. The results show that macromolecular crowdingaffects protein-folding dynamics as well as overall protein shape. In crowded milieus; distinctconformational changes in VlsE are accompanied by secondary structure alterations thatlead to exposure of a hidden antigenic region. Our work demonstrates the malleability of“native” proteins and implies that crowding-induced shape changes may be important forprotein function and malfunction in vivo.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2008,175
Domain swapping is a consequence of minimal frustration,Sichun Yang; Samuel S Cho; Yaakov Levy; Margaret S Cheung; Herbert Levine; Peter G Wolynes; José N Onuchic,Abstract The same energy landscape principles associated with the folding of proteins intotheir monomeric conformations should also describe how these proteins oligomerize intodomain-swapped conformations. We tested this hypothesis by using a simplified model forthe epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 src homology 3 domain protein;both of whose monomeric and domain-swapped structures have been solved. The model;which we call the symmetrized Gō-type model; incorporates only information regarding themonomeric conformation in an energy function for the dimer to predict the domain-swappedconformation. A striking preference for the correct domain-swapped structure was observed;indicating that overall monomer topology is a main determinant of the structure of domain-swapped dimers. Furthermore; we explore the free energy surface for domain swapping …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2004,156
Pathways of electron transfer in Escherichia coli DNA photolyase: Trp306 to FADH,Margaret S Cheung; Iraj Daizadeh; AA Stuchebrukhov; Paul F Heelis,Abstract We describe the results of a series of theoretical calculations of electron transferpathways between Trp 306 and* FADH· in the Escherichia coli DNA photolyase molecule;using the method of interatomic tunneling currents. It is found that there are twoconformationally orthogonal tryptophans; Trp 359 and Trp 382; between donor and acceptorthat play a crucial role in the pathways of the electron transfer process. The pathwaysdepend vitally on the aromaticity of tryptophans and the flavin molecule. The results of thiscalculation suggest that the major pathway of the electron transfer is due to a set ofoverlapping orthogonal π-rings; which starts from the donor Trp 306; runs through Trp 359and Trp 382; and finally reaches the flavin group of the acceptor complex; FADH.,Biophysical journal,1999,96
Nanopore–protein interactions dramatically alter stability and yield of the native state in restricted spaces,Margaret S Cheung; D Thirumalai,We have studied the stability and the yield of the folded WW domains in a sphericalnanopore to provide insights into the changes in the folding characteristics due tointeractions of the polypeptide (SP) with the walls of the pore. Using different models for theinteractions between the nanopore and the polypeptide chain we have obtained results thatare relevant to a broad range of experiments.(a) In the temperature and the strength of theSP–pore interaction plane (λ); there are four “phases;” namely; the unfolded state; the nativestate; the molten globule phase (MG); and the surface interaction-stabilized (SIS) state. TheMG and SIS states are populated at moderate and large values of λ; respectively. For a fixedpore size; the folding rates vary non-monotonically as λ is varied with a maximum at λ≈ 1 atwhich the SP–nanopore interaction is comparable to the stability of the native state. At …,Journal of molecular biology,2006,81
Factors defining effects of macromolecular crowding on protein stability: an in vitro/in silico case study using cytochrome c,Alexander Christiansen; Qian Wang; Antonios Samiotakis; Margaret S Cheung; Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede,Previous experiments with two single-domain proteins showed that macromolecularcrowding can stabilize dramatically toward heat perturbation and modulate native-statestructure and shape. To assess the generality of this; we here tested the effects of thesynthetic crowding agents on cytochrome c; a small single-domain protein. Using far-UVcircular dichroism (CD); we discovered that there is no effect on cytochrome c's secondarystructure upon addition of Ficoll or dextran (0− 400 mg/mL; pH 7). Thermal experimentsrevealed stabilizing effects (5− 10° C) of Ficoll 70 and dextran 70; this effect was enhancedby the presence of low levels of guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) that destabilize theprotein. When using a smaller dextran; dextran 40; the thermal effects were larger (10− 20°C). In silico analysis; using structure-based (Go-like) interactions for cytochrome c; is in …,Biochemistry,2010,80
Effects of crowding and confinement on the structures of the transition state ensemble in proteins,Margaret S Cheung; D Thirumalai,Characterization of the structures of the transition state ensemble is a key step in describingthe folding reaction. Using two variants of a coarse-grained model of the three-stranded β-sheet WW domain and a fully automated progress variable clustering (PVC) algorithm; wehave dissected the effect of macromolecular crowding and confinement on the changes inthe transition state structures in comparison to bulk. Each amino acid is represented using aCα atom and a side chain. The distance between the Cα atom and center of mass of the sidechain is taken to be its effective van der Waals radius. For the bulk case; we predict using thePVC algorithm; which does not assume knowledge of the underlying folding reactioncoordinate; that there are two classes of structures in the transition state ensemble (TSE).The structures in both of the classes are compact. The dominant cluster is more structured …,The Journal of Physical Chemistry B,2007,75
The energy landscape for protein folding and possible connections to function,Margaret S Cheung; Leslie L Chavez; José N Onuchic,Abstract In this article we review and discuss the state-of-the-art methods using minimalistmodels in the context of energy landscape theory to study protein folding. As goodagreement between computational/theoretical studies and experimental observations invitro continues to emerge; many research groups are asking how this structural anddynamical information can be used to understand proteins in vivo. This is a non-trivialquestion drawing from very limited in vivo studies. From the perspective of theory; it is a newhorizon for theoreticians to test or revise their theories by making connections toexperiments on this matter. We present a short discussion of several recent efforts thatinclude factors reflecting the cellular environment in computer simulations—and that mayprovide some insight into the behavior of protein dynamics inside the living cell as well as …,Polymer,2004,75
Solvation in protein folding analysis: combination of theoretical and experimental approaches,AM Fernandez-Escamilla; MS Cheung; MC Vega; M Wilmanns; JN Onuchic; L Serrano,Abstract An effort to combine theoretical analyses and protein engineering methods hasbeen made to probe the folding mechanism of SH3 by using Energy Landscape Theory anda φ-value analysis. Particular emphasis was given to core residues and the effect ofdesolvation during the folding event by replacing the core valines with isosteric threonines.These mutations have the advantage of keeping the core structurally invariant whileaffecting core stability relative to the unfolded state. Although the valines that form the coreappear spatially invariant; the folding kinetics of their threonine mutants varies; indicatingtheir different extent of solvation in the transition-state ensemble. Theoretical studiespredicted the distribution of folding kinetics of threonine mutants without previous knowledgeof the measured rates. This initial success encourages further investigations of the …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2004,71
Macromolecular crowding modulates folding mechanism of α/β protein apoflavodoxin,Dirar Homouz; Loren Stagg; Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede; Margaret S Cheung,Abstract Protein dynamics in cells may be different from those in dilute solutions in vitro;because the environment in cells is highly concentrated with other macromolecules. Thisvolume exclusion because of macromolecular crowding is predicted to affect bothequilibrium and kinetic processes involving protein conformational changes. To quantifymacromolecular crowding effects on protein folding mechanisms; we investigated the foldingenergy landscape of an α/β protein; apoflavodoxin; in the presence of inert macromolecularcrowding agents; using in silico and in vitro approaches. By means of coarse-grainedmolecular simulations and topology-based potential interactions; we probed the effects ofincreased volume fractions of crowding agents (ϕ c) as well as of crowding agent geometry(sphere or spherocylinder) at high ϕ c.

Folding; stability and shape of proteins in crowded environments: experimental and computational approaches,Antonios Samiotakis; Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede; Margaret S Cheung,How the crowded environment inside cells affects folding; stability and structures of proteinsis a vital question; since most proteins are made and function inside cells. Here we describehow crowded conditions can be created in vitro and in silico and how we have used this toprobe effects on protein properties. We have found that folded forms of proteins becomemore compact in the presence of macromolecular crowding agents; if the protein isaspherical; the shape also changes (extent dictated by native-state stability and chemicalconditions). It was also discovered that the shape of the macromolecular crowding agentmodulates the folding mechanism of a protein; in addition; the extent of asphericity of theprotein itself is an important factor in defining its folding speed.,*,2009,57
Exploring the interplay between topology and secondary structural formation in the protein folding problem,Margaret S Cheung; John M Finke; Benjamin Callahan; Jose N Onuchic,Simple models with a single bead representation (Cα models) have been successful inproviding a qualitative understanding of the folding mechanism of small globular proteins.Can we go beyond this qualitative understanding and make more detailed quantitativeconnections to experiments? To achieve this goal; a tractable framework of proteinrepresentations whose complexity falls between Cα and all-atom representations is neededto address different energetic competing factors during folding events. Such a modelconserves the low computational expense inherent in minimalist models while enhancingthe understanding of side-chain packing not existent in simple Cα models. In this work; wepresent a minimalist representation of protein structures that are used to investigate thecompetition between native side-chain contacts and nonspecific backbone hydrogen …,The Journal of Physical Chemistry B,2003,57
The effect of macromolecular crowding; ionic strength and calcium binding on calmodulin dynamics,Qian Wang; Kao-Chen Liang; Arkadiusz Czader; M Neal Waxham; Margaret S Cheung,The flexibility in the structure of calmodulin (CaM) allows its binding to over 300 targetproteins in the cell. To investigate the structure-function relationship of CaM; we combinedmethods of computer simulation and experiments based on circular dichroism (CD) toinvestigate the structural characteristics of CaM that influence its target recognition incrowded cell-like conditions. We developed a unique multiscale solution of chargescomputed from quantum chemistry; together with protein reconstruction; coarse-grainedmolecular simulations; and statistical physics; to represent the charge distribution in thetransition from apoCaM to holoCaM upon calcium binding. Computationally; we found thatincreased levels of macromolecular crowding; in addition to calcium binding and ionicstrength typical of that found inside cells; can impact the conformation; helicity and the EF …,PLoS computational biology,2011,46
Modulation of calmodulin plasticity by the effect of macromolecular crowding,Dirar Homouz; Hugo Sanabria; M Neal Waxham; Margaret S Cheung,Abstract In vitro biochemical reactions are most often studied in dilute solution; a poor mimicof the intracellular space of eukaryotic cells; which are crowded with mobile and immobilemacromolecules. Such crowded conditions exert volume exclusion and other entropic forcesthat have the potential to impact chemical equilibria and reaction rates. In this article; weused the well-characterized and ubiquitous molecule calmodulin (CaM) and a combinationof theoretical and experimental approaches to address how crowding impacts CaM'sconformational plasticity. CaM is a dumbbell-shaped molecule that contains four EF hands(two in the N-lobe and two in the C-lobe) that each could bind Ca 2+; leading to stabilizationof certain substates that favor interactions with other target proteins. Using coarse-grainedmolecular simulations; we explored the distribution of CaM conformations in the presence …,Journal of molecular biology,2009,45
Multiscale investigation of chemical interference in proteins,Antonios Samiotakis; Dirar Homouz; Margaret S Cheung,We developed a multiscale approach (MultiSCAAL) that integrates the potential of meanforce obtained from all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with a knowledge-basedenergy function for coarse-grained molecular simulations in better exploring the energylandscape of a small protein under chemical interference such as chemical denaturation. Anexcessive amount of water molecules in all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations oftennegatively impacts the sampling efficiency of some advanced sampling techniques such asthe replica exchange method and it makes the investigation of chemical interferences onprotein dynamics difficult. Thus; there is a need to develop an effective strategy that focuseson sampling structural changes in protein conformations rather than solvent moleculefluctuations. In this work; we address this issue by devising a multiscale simulation …,The Journal of chemical physics,2010,37
Mechanisms of cooperativity underlying sequence-independent β-sheet formation,Chinlin Guo; Margaret S Cheung; Herbert Levine; David A Kessler,We investigate the formation of β-sheet structures in proteins without sequence-dependentside-chain interactions. To accomplish this; we introduce a model which explicitlyincorporates both solvation effects and the angular dependence (on the protein backbone)of hydrogen bond formation. The thermodynamics of this model is studied by exploring thedensity of states for the entire system and the local couplings in a partially folded structure.Our results suggest that solvation dynamics together with the H-bond angular dependencegives rise to a generic cooperativity in this class of systems; this result explains whypathological aggregates involving β-sheet cores can form from many different proteins. Ourwork provides the foundation for the construction of phenomenological models to investigatetopology effects in β-sheet folding and the competition between native folding and …,The Journal of chemical physics,2002,37
Crowding effects on the structural transitions in a flexible helical homopolymer,Alexander Kudlay; Margaret S Cheung; D Thirumalai,Abstract We elucidate the structural transitions in a helical off-lattice homopolymer inducedby crowding agents; as a function of the number of monomers (N) and volume fraction (ϕ c)of crowding particles. At ϕ c= 0; the homopolymer undergoes transitions from a random coilto a helix; helical hairpin HH; and helix bundle HB structures depending on N; andtemperature. Crowding induces chain compaction that can promote HH or HB formationdepending on ϕ c. Typically; the helical content decreases which is reflected in the decreasein the transition temperatures that depend on ϕ c; N; and the size of the crowding particles.,Physical review letters,2009,32
Effects of macromolecular crowding on burst phase kinetics of cytochrome c folding,Eefei Chen; Alexander Christiansen; Qian Wang; Margaret S Cheung; David S Kliger; Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede,Excluded volume and viscosity effects of crowding agents that mimic crowded conditions invivo on “classical” burst phase folding kinetics of cytochrome c are assessed in vitro. Uponelectron transfer-triggered folding of reduced cytochrome c; far-UV time-resolved circulardichroism (TRCD) is used to monitor folding under different conditions. Earlier work hasshown that folding of reduced cytochrome c from the guanidinium hydrochloride-inducedunfolded ensemble in dilute phosphate buffer involves kinetic partitioning: one fraction ofmolecules folds rapidly; on a time scale identical to that of reduction; while the remainingpopulation folds more slowly. In the presence of 220 mg/mL dextran 70; a syntheticmacromolecular crowding agent that occupies space but does not interact with proteins; thepopulation of the fast folding step for cytochrome c is greatly reduced.

Protein recognition and selection through conformational and mutually induced fit,Qian Wang; Pengzhi Zhang; Laurel Hoffman; Swarnendu Tripathi; Dirar Homouz; Yin Liu; M Neal Waxham; Margaret S Cheung,Abstract Protein–protein interactions drive most every biological process; but in manyinstances the domains mediating recognition are disordered. How specificity in binding isattained in the absence of defined structure contrasts with well-established experimentaland theoretical work describing ligand binding to protein. The signaling protein calmodulinpresents a unique opportunity to investigate mechanisms for target recognition given that itinteracts with several hundred different targets. By advancing coarse-grained computersimulations and experimental techniques; mechanistic insights were gained in defining thepathways leading to recognition and in how target selectivity can be achieved at themolecular level. A model requiring mutually induced conformational changes in bothcalmodulin and target proteins was necessary and broadly informs how proteins can …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2013,29
A structural model of polyglutamine determined from a host-guest method combining experiments and landscape theory,John M Finke; Margaret S Cheung; José N Onuchic,Abstract Modeling the structure of natively disordered peptides has proved difficult due to thelack of structural information on these peptides. In this work; we use a novel application ofthe host-guest method; combining folding theory with experiments; to model the structure ofnatively disordered polyglutamine peptides. Initially; a minimalist molecular model (C α C β)of CI2 is developed with a structurally based potential and captures many of the foldingproperties of CI2 determined from experiments. Next; polyglutamine “guest” inserts ofincreasing length are introduced into the CI2 “host” model and the polyglutamine is modeledto match the resultant change in CI2 thermodynamic stability between simulations andexperiments. The polyglutamine model that best mimics the experimental changes in CI2thermodynamic stability has 1); a β-strand dihedral preference and 2); an attractive …,Biophysical journal,2004,29
Manipulating biopolymer dynamics by anisotropic nanoconfinement,Shao-Qing Zhang; Margaret S Cheung,How the geometry of nanosized confinement affects dynamics of biomaterials is interestingyet poorly understood. An elucidation of structural details upon nanosized confinement maybenefit manufacturing pharmaceuticals in biomaterial sciences and medicine. The behaviorof biopolymers in nanosized confinement is investigated using coarse-grained models andmolecular simulations. Particularly; we address the effects of shapes of a confinement onprotein-folding dynamics by measuring folding rates and dissecting structural properties ofthe transition states in nanosized spheres and ellipsoids. We find that when the form of aconfinement resembles the geometrical properties of the transition states; the rates of foldingkinetics are most enhanced. This knowledge of shape selectivity in identifying optimalconditions for reactions will have a broad impact in nanotechnology and pharmaceutical …,Nano letters,2007,28
Effects of macromolecular crowding agents on protein folding in vitro and in silico,Alexander Christiansen; Qian Wang; Margaret S Cheung; Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede,Abstract Proteins fold and function inside cells which are environments very different fromthat of dilute buffer solutions most often used in traditional experiments. The crowded milieuresults in excluded-volume effects; increased bulk viscosity and amplified chances for inter-molecular interactions. These environmental factors have not been accounted for in mostmechanistic studies of protein folding executed during the last decades. The question thusarises as to how these effects—present when polypeptides normally fold in vivo—modulateprotein biophysics. To address excluded volume effects; we use synthetic macromolecularcrowding agents; which take up significant volume but do not interact with proteins; incombination with strategically selected proteins and a range of equilibrium and time-resolved biophysical (spectroscopic and computational) methods. In this review; we …,*,2013,26
Folding dynamics of Trp-cage in the presence of chemical interference and macromolecular crowding. I,Antonios Samiotakis; Margaret S Cheung,Proteins fold and function in the crowded environment of the cell's interior. In the recentyears it has been well established that the so-called “macromolecular crowding” effectenhances the folding stability of proteins by destabilizing their unfolded states for selectedproteins. On the other hand; chemical and thermal denaturation is often used in experimentsas a tool to destabilize a protein by populating the unfolded states when probing its foldinglandscape and thermodynamic properties. However; little is known about the complicatedeffects of these synergistic perturbations acting on the kinetic properties of proteins;particularly when large structural fluctuations; such as protein folding; have been involved. Inthis study; we have first investigated the folding mechanism of Trp-cage dependent on ureaconcentration by coarse-grained molecular simulations where the impact of urea is …,The Journal of chemical physics,2011,23
Electrostatics; structure prediction; and the energy landscapes for protein folding and binding,Min‐Yeh Tsai; Weihua Zheng; D Balamurugan; Nicholas P Schafer; Bobby L Kim; Margaret S Cheung; Peter G Wolynes,Abstract While being long in range and therefore weakly specific; electrostatic interactionsare able to modulate the stability and folding landscapes of some proteins. The relevance ofelectrostatic forces for steering the docking of proteins to each other is widelyacknowledged; however; the role of electrostatics in establishing specifically funneledlandscapes and their relevance for protein structure prediction are still not clear. Byintroducing Debye-Hückel potentials that mimic long-range electrostatic forces into theAssociative memory; Water mediated; Structure; and Energy Model (AWSEM); a transferableprotein model capable of predicting tertiary structures; we assess the effects of electrostaticson the landscapes of thirteen monomeric proteins and four dimers. For the monomers; wefind that adding electrostatic interactions does not improve structure prediction …,Protein Science,2016,20
A physics-based approach of coarse-graining the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli (CGCYTO),Qian Wang; Margaret S Cheung,Abstract We have investigated protein stability in an environment of Escherichia colicytoplasm using coarse-grained computer simulations. To coarse-grain a small slide of E.coli's cytoplasm consisting of over 16 million atoms; we have developed a self-assembledclustering algorithm (CGCYTO). CGCYTO uses the shape parameter and asphericity as wellas a parameter λ (ranging from 0 to 1) that measures the covolume of a test protein and amacromolecule against the covolume of a test protein and a sphere of equal volume as thatof a macromolecule for the criteria of coarse-graining a cytoplasmic model. A cutoff λ c= 0.8was chosen based on the size of a test protein and computational resources and itdetermined the resolution of a coarse-grained cytoplasm. We compared the results from apolydisperse cytoplasmic model (PD model) produced by CGCYTO with two other coarse …,Biophysical journal,2012,20
Unraveling the Mechanism of Photoinduced Charge Transfer in Carotenoid–Porphyrin–C60 Molecular Triad,Arun K Manna; D Balamurugan; Margaret S Cheung; Barry D Dunietz,Photoinduced charge transfer (CT) plays a central role in biologically significant systemsand in applications that harvest solar energy. We investigate the relationship of CT kineticsand conformation in a molecular triad. The triad; consisting of carotenoid; porphyrin; andfullerene is structurally flexible and able to acquire significantly varied conformations underambient conditions. With an integrated approach of quantum calculations and moleculardynamics simulations; we compute the rate of CT at two distinctive conformations. Thelinearly extended conformation; in which the donor (carotenoid) and the acceptor (fullerene)are separated by nearly 50 Å; enables charge separation through a sequential CT process.A representative bent conformation that is entropically dominant; however; attenuates theCT; although the donor and the acceptor are spatially closer.

Influence of the shape of crowding particles on the structural transitions in a polymer,Alexander Kudlay; Margaret S Cheung; D Thirumalai,We investigate the structural transitions in a polymer induced by spherical and nonsphericalcrowding particles over a wide range of conditions. The polymer conformations are specifiedby the radius of gyration and the quality of the solvent in the absence of crowding particles.In the presence of crowding particles; the structures are altered by the volume fraction; size;shape; and polydispersity of the crowders. We show that crowding induces an array ofstructural changes; ranging from helix; helical hairpin (HH); and multiple helix bundles(HBs); depending on the interplay of multiple length and energy scales including the solventquality; length of the polymer; temperature; and the characteristics of the crowding agents. Innearly good solvents; the polymer undergoes coil–helix transition in accord with thepredictions based on the entropic stabilization mechanism.

Comparison of chemical and thermal protein denaturation by combination of computational and experimental approaches. II,Qian Wang; Alexander Christiansen; Antonios Samiotakis; Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede; Margaret S Cheung,Chemical and thermal denaturation methods have been widely used to investigate foldingprocesses of proteins in vitro. However; a molecular understanding of the relationshipbetween these two perturbation methods is lacking. Here; we combined computational andexperimental approaches to investigate denaturing effects on three structurally differentproteins. We derived a linear relationship between thermal denaturation at temperature Tband chemical denaturation at another temperature Tu using the stability change of a protein(ΔG). For this; we related the dependence of ΔG on temperature; in the Gibbs-Helmholtzequation; to that of ΔG on urea concentration in the linear extrapolation method; assumingthat there is a temperature pair from the urea (Tu) and the aqueous (Tb) ensembles thatproduces the same protein structures. We tested this relationship on apoazurin …,The Journal of chemical physics,2011,15
Where soft matter meets living matter—protein structure; stability; and folding in the cell,Margaret S Cheung,A protein is a biopolymer that self-assembles through the process of protein folding. A cell isa crowded space where the surrounding macromolecules of a protein can limit the numberof ways of folding. These crowding macromolecules can also affect the shape and the size ofa physically malleable; or 'soft; squishy'; protein with regulatory purposes. In this review; wefocus on the in silico approaches of coarse-grained molecular simulations that enable theinvestigation of protein folding in a cell-like environment. When these simulation resultswere compared with experimentally measured properties of a protein; such joint effort hasyielded new ideas on the specific function of a protein in cells. We also highlighted therecent developments of computer modeling and simulations that encompass the importanceof the shape of a macromolecule; the interactions between macromolecules; and the …,*,2013,14
Biophysical properties of membrane-active peptides based on micelle modeling: a case study of cell-penetrating and antimicrobial peptides,Qian Wang; Gongyi Hong; Glenn R Johnson; Ruth Pachter; Margaret S Cheung,We investigated the molecular mechanisms of short peptides interacting with membrane-mimetic systems. Three short peptides were selected for this study: penetratin as a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP); and temporin A and KSL as antimicrobial peptides (AMP). Weinvestigated the detailed interactions of the peptides with dodecylphosphocholine (DPC)and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles; and the subsequent peptide insertion based onfree energy calculations by using all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with theunited atom force field and explicit solvent models. First; we found that the free energybarrier to insertion for the three peptides is dependent on the chemical composition of themicelles. Because of the favorable electrostatic interactions between the peptides and theheadgroups of lipids; the insertion barrier into an SDS micelle is less than a DPC micelle …,The journal of physical chemistry B,2010,14
Residue-specific analysis of frustration in the folding landscape of repeat β/α protein apoflavodoxin,Loren Stagg; Antonios Samiotakis; Dirar Homouz; Margaret S Cheung; Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede,Abstract Flavodoxin adopts the common repeat β/α topology and folds in a complex kineticreaction with intermediates. To better understand this reaction; we analyzed a set ofDesulfovibrio desulfuricans apoflavodoxin variants with point mutations in most secondarystructure elements by in vitro and in silico methods. By equilibrium unfolding experiments;we first revealed how different secondary structure elements contribute to overall proteinresistance to heat and urea. Next; using stopped-flow mixing coupled with far-UV circulardichroism; we probed how individual residues affect the amount of structure formed in theexperimentally detected burst-phase intermediate. Together with in silico folding routeanalysis of the same point-mutated variants and computation of growth in nucleation sizeduring early folding; computer simulations suggested the presence of two competing …,Journal of molecular biology,2010,14
Cysteine-cysteine contact preference leads to target-focusing in protein folding,Mihaela E Sardiu; Margaret S Cheung; Yi-Kuo Yu,Abstract We perform a statistical analysis of amino-acid contacts to investigate possiblepreferences of amino-acid interactions. We include in the analysis only tertiary contacts;because they are less constrained—compared to secondary contacts—by proteins'backbone rigidity. Using proteins from the protein data bank; our analysis reveals anunusually high frequency of cysteine pairings relative to that expected from random. Toelucidate the possible effects of cysteine interactions in folding; we perform molecularsimulations on three cysteine-rich proteins. In particular; we investigate the difference infolding dynamics between a Gō-like model (where attraction only occurs between aminoacids forming a native contact) and a variant model (where attraction between any twocysteines is introduced to mimic the formation/dissociation of native/nonnative disulfide …,Biophysical journal,2007,14
Computational studies of the reversible domain swapping of p13suc1,Jorge Chahine; Margaret S Cheung,Abstract A minimalist representation of protein structures using a Go-like potential forinteractions is implemented to investigate the mechanisms of the domain swapping ofp13suc1; a protein that exists in two native conformations: a monomer and a domain-swapped dimer formed by the exchange of a β-strand. Inspired by experimental studieswhich showed a similarity of the transition states for folding of the monomer and the dimer; inthis study we justify this similarity in molecular descriptions. When intermediates arepopulated in the simulations; formation of a domain-swapped dimer initiates from theensemble of unfolded monomers; given by the fact that the dimer formation occurs at thefolding/unfolding temperature of the monomer (T f). It is also shown that transitions; leadingto a dimer; involve the presence of two intermediates; one of them has a dimeric form and …,Biophysical journal,2005,11
Multiscale simulation of the ground and photo-induced charge-separated states of a molecular triad in polar organic solvent: exploring the conformations; fluctuation...,D Balamurugan; Adelia JA Aquino; Francis de Dios; Lionel Flores Jr; Hans Lischka; Margaret S Cheung,The approach of a multiscale simulation that combines quantum chemical calculations;classical molecular dynamics simulations; and statistical physics to integrate the informationof the electronic states of a conformationally complex molecule into its structural distributionover an ensemble was performed to understand the influence of a polar organic solvent onthe structural stability of carotene-porphyrin-fullerene molecular triad in both the ground andthe photoinduced charge-separated excited states. The excited states of the triad werecomputed with the ab initio quantum chemical calculations using the algebraic diagrammaticconstruction through the second order correction (ADC (2)) method and the time-dependentdensity functional theory (TDDFT). The replica exchange molecular dynamics was used forthe enhanced sampling of the ensemble in order to explore the phase space of the …,The Journal of Physical Chemistry B,2013,9
Multiscale Simulation on a Light-Harvesting Molecular Triad,Guoxiong Su; Arkadiusz Czader; Dirar Homouz; Gabriela Bernardes; Sana Mateen; Margaret S Cheung,We have investigated the effect of solvation and confinement on an artificial photosyntheticmaterial; carotenoid-porphyrin-C60 molecular triad; by a multiscale approach and anenhanced sampling technique. We have developed a combined approach of quantumchemistry; statistical physics; and all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulation to determinethe partial atomic charges of the ground-state triad. To fully explore the free energylandscape of triad; the replica exchange method was applied to enhance the samplingefficiency of the simulations. The confinement effects on the triad were modeled by imposingthree sizes of spherocylindrical nanocapsules. The triad is structurally flexible under ambientconditions; and its conformation distribution is manipulated by the choice of water modelsand confinement. Two types of water models (SPC/E and TIP3P) are used for solvation …,The Journal of Physical Chemistry B,2012,9
Conformational frustration in calmodulin–target recognition,Swarnendu Tripathi; Qian Wang; Pengzhi Zhang; Laurel Hoffman; M Neal Waxham; Margaret S Cheung,Abstract Calmodulin (CaM) is a primary calcium (Ca 2+)-signaling protein that specificallyrecognizes and activates highly diverse target proteins. We explored the molecular basis oftarget recognition of CaM with peptides representing the CaM-binding domains from two Ca2+-CaM-dependent kinases; CaMKI and CaMKII; by employing experimentally constrainedmolecular simulations. Detailed binding route analysis revealed that the two CaM targetpeptides; although similar in length and net charge; follow distinct routes that lead to ahigher binding frustration in the CaM–CaMKII complex than in the CaM–CaMKI complex. Wediscovered that the molecular origin of the binding frustration is caused by intermolecularcontacts formed with the C-domain of CaM that need to be broken before the formation ofintermolecular contacts with the N-domain of CaM. We argue that the binding frustration is …,Journal of Molecular Recognition,2015,7
A robust communication framework for parallel execution on volunteer PC grids,Eshwar Rohit; Hien Nguyen; Nagarajan Kanna; Jaspal Subhlok; Edgar Gabriel; Qian Wang; Margaret S Cheung; David Anderson,Volunteer PC grids represent massive computation capacity at a low cost; but arechallenging to employ for parallel computing because of variable and unpredictableperformance and availability. A communicating parallel program must employ explicitredundancy; or implicit redundancy with uncoordinated checkpoint-restart to makecontinuous forward progress in such an unreliable environment. A communication modelbased on one-sided Put/Get calls to an abstract global shared space is a good match asprocesses can execute their communication operations independently and asynchronously.However; no existing system is designed for redundant communicating processes. The keyproblem is that a single logical operation that impacts the global program state may beexecuted by different instances of the same process at different times leading to semantic …,Cluster; Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGrid); 2011 11th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on,2011,6
Lessons in protein design from combined evolution and conformational dynamics,Swarnendu Tripathi; M Neal Waxham; Margaret S Cheung; Yin Liu,Abstract Protein-protein interactions play important roles in the control of every cellularprocess. How natural selection has optimized protein design to produce molecules capableof binding to many partner proteins is a fascinating problem but not well understood. Here;we performed a combinatorial analysis of protein sequence evolution and conformationaldynamics to study how calmodulin (CaM); which plays essential roles in calcium signalingpathways; has adapted to bind to a large number of partner proteins. We discovered thatamino acid residues in CaM can be partitioned into unique classes according to their degreeof evolutionary conservation and local stability. Holistically; categorization of CaM residuesinto these classes reveals enriched physico-chemical interactions required for binding todiverse targets; balanced against the need to maintain the folding and structural …,Scientific reports,2015,5
Correlation between Gene Variants; Signaling Pathways; and Efficacy of Chemotherapy Drugs against Colon Cancers,Swarnendu Tripathi; Louiza Belkacemi; Margaret S Cheung; Rathindra N Bose,Efficacies; toxicities; and resistance mechanisms of chemotherapy drugs; such as oxaliplatinand 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); vary widely among various categories and subcategories of coloncancers. By understanding the differences in the drug efficacy and resistance at the level ofprotein–protein networks; we identified the correlation between the drug activity ofoxaliplatin/5-FU and gene variations from the US National Cancer Institute-60 human cancercell lines. The activity of either of these drugs is correlated with specific amino acid variant(s) of KRAS and other genes from the signaling pathways of colon cancer progression. Wealso discovered that the activity of a non-DNA-binding novel platinum drug; phosphaplatin;is comparable with oxaliplatin and 5-FU when it was tested against colon cancer cell lines.Our strategy that combines the knowledge from pharmacogenomics across cell lines with …,Cancer informatics,2016,3
Relative cosolute size influences the kinetics of protein-protein interactions,Laurel Hoffman; Xu Wang; Hugo Sanabria; Margaret S Cheung; John A Putkey; M Neal Waxham,Abstract Protein signaling occurs in crowded intracellular environments; and while highconcentrations of macromolecules are postulated to modulate protein-protein interactions;analysis of their impact at each step of the reaction pathway has not been systematicallyaddressed. Potential cosolute-induced alterations in target association are particularlyimportant for a signaling molecule like calmodulin (CaM); where competition among> 300targets governs which pathways are selectively activated. To explore how highconcentrations of cosolutes influence CaM-target affinity and kinetics; we methodicallyinvestigated each step of the CaM-target binding mechanism under crowded or osmolyte-rich environments mimicked by ficoll-70; dextran-10; and sucrose. All cosolutes stabilizedcompact conformers of CaM and modulated association kinetics by affecting diffusion and …,Biophysical journal,2015,3
Redundancy tolerant communication on volatile nodes,Nagarajan Kanna; Jaspal Subhlok; Edgar Gabriel; Margaret Cheung; David Anderson,Abstract Idle PCs represent a massive platform for scientific parallel computing but they arevolatile; the availability of a PC for guest computations can change suddenly andunexpectedly based on the actions of the PC owner. To execute effectively in a volatileenvironment; a communicating parallel program must employ checkpoint-restart and/orredundancy to make continuous forward progress in the presence of routine failures. Acommunication model based on one-sided Put/Get calls; pioneered by the Linda system; isa good match for such an environment as processes can execute their communicationoperations independently and asynchronously. However; Linda and its many variants arenot designed for processes that are replicated or restarted from checkpoints. The keyproblem is that a single logical operation may be executed multiple times by different …,*,2008,3
Opposing Intermolecular Tuning of Ca2+ Affinity for Calmodulin by Neurogranin and CaMKII Peptides,Pengzhi Zhang; Swarnendu Tripathi; Hoa Trinh; Margaret S Cheung,Abstract We investigated the impact of bound calmodulin (CaM)-target compound structureon the affinity of calcium (Ca 2+) by integrating coarse-grained models and all-atomisticsimulations with nonequilibrium physics. We focused on binding between CaM and twospecific targets; Ca 2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and neurogranin (Ng); asthey both regulate CaM-dependent Ca 2+ signaling pathways in neurons. It was shownexperimentally that Ca 2+/CaM (holoCaM) binds to the CaMKII peptide with overwhelminglyhigher affinity than Ca 2+-free CaM (apoCaM); the binding of CaMKII peptide to CaM inreturn increases the Ca 2+ affinity for CaM. However; this reciprocal relation was notobserved in the Ng peptide (Ng 13–49); which binds to apoCaM or holoCaM with bindingaffinities of the same order of magnitude. Unlike the holoCaM-CaMKII peptide; whose …,Biophysical journal,2017,2
An execution environment for robust parallel computing on volunteer pc grids,Hien Nguyen; Eshwar Pedamallu; Jaspal Subhlok; Edgar Gabriel; Qian Wang; Margaret S Cheung; David Anderson,A pool of distributed volunteer PCs presents an extremely hostile environment for executionof communicating parallel codes due to system and network heterogeneity; varyingavailability; and frequent failures. Well known methods for fault tolerance; specificallyreplication and check pointing; are challenging to deploy and not sufficient individually toprovide continuous forward application progress. As the failure of a single logical processleads to application failure; the degree of redundancy needed for long running applicationsis too large to be practical. Check pointing and rollback does not provide protection againstslow and variable speed nodes and is impractical when system wide MTBF is in minutes orless; common for a moderate size volunteer computing pool. The approach taken in thisresearch is to exploit both; but that presents formidable challenges; efficient check …,Parallel Processing (ICPP); 2012 41st International Conference on,2012,2
Hydrophobic Interactions of Hexane in Nanosized Water Droplets,Dirar Homouz; Byron Hoffman; Margaret S Cheung,We use all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study hydrophobic interactions ofhexane in nanosized water droplets where the hydrogen bonding network of watermolecules is disrupted at the surface. As a result of the competition between the energeticsof a hexane molecule and the distribution of water molecules that lost the ability to formhydrogen bonds at the boundary; all-trans-hexane molecules are statistically favored at thesurface of a nanosized water droplet and such a statistical trend increases as the size of anano water droplet decreases. Changes in the radial distribution and the orientation of watermolecules surrounding hexane in nanosized water droplets over bulk water are indicative ofthe finite-size effects on the structural distribution of a short; topologically complexhydrocarbon chain.,The Journal of Physical Chemistry B,2009,2
SCAAL: A robust; accurate; and high-efficient all-atomistic protein reconstruction method from low-resolution protein models,Antonios Samiotakis; Margaret S Cheung; Dirar Homouz,Groningen University; Groningen; Netherlands. MARTINI force field: extension tocarbohydrates We present an extension of the coarse grained (CG) MARTINI force field (1)to carbohydrates. In line with the MARTINI force field development; the coarse grainedmodel for carbohydrates has been systematically parameterized based on reproduction ofexperimental partitioning free energies in combination with mimicking the behaviour seen inatomistic simulations. Parameters were derived for all common mono-and disaccharides;considering the different ways of linking for monosaccharide units. The model has beentested on a number of small polysaccharides. For instance; the folding of a 26 (a 1-4) D-glucopyranose amylose chain was simulated both in a non-polar (nonane) and polar (water)environment. The folded structure is found to be similar for the CG and the all-atom model.,Biophysical Journal,2009,1

Induced polarization restricts the conformational distribution of a light-harvesting molecular triad in the ground state,Oleg N Starovoytov; Pengzhi Zhang; Piotr Cieplak; Margaret S Cheung,The light-harvesting molecular triad consisting of carotenoid polyene (C); diaryl-porphyrin(P) and pyrrole-fullerene (C60) is a donor–acceptor molecule capable of absorbing incidentlight in the visible range. Its ability to convert solar energy to electrical excitation and chargeseparation energy suggests a great potential in real-world applications. The ensemble of itsconformations under ambient conditions varies widely according to its electronic state. Inprevious work; we applied a non-polarizable model to study the conformational distributionof the molecular triad in the ground and charge separated states. However; due to the lack ofpolarization; which imparts subtle changes in the charge distribution on atoms; molecularsimulations fail to produce accurate average dipole moments. We developed the firstpolarizable model for a molecular triad to investigate the structural and dynamic …,Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,2017,*
Abstract B1-02: Correlation between oncogenic mutations; signaling pathways; and efficacy of platinum-based drugs against colorectal cancers,Swarnendu Tripathi; Louiza Belkacemi; Margaret S Cheung; Rathindra N Bose,The purpose of this study is to correlate genetic mutations; amino-acid variants; signalingpathways with platiunum based drug activity to shed light on personalized treatment ofcancer. Platinum anticancer drugs such as cisplatin; carboplatin; and oxalipaltin are widelyused to treat a variety of cancers. Although DNA is the molecular target for these platinumtherapies; their efficacies; toxicities; and resistance mechanisms vary widely among variouscategories and sub-categories of cancers. To comprehend this great variability; anintegrated analysis was performed to determine the impact of somatic mutations on proteinfunctions; signaling pathways; and drug activity (sensitivity or resistance) among the USNational Cancer Institute (NCI) 60 human tumor cell lines based on Z-scores to predict apriori treatment outcome using CellMiner (http://discover. nci. nih. gov/cellminer) …,*,2015,*
Calmodulin; Models of,M Neal Waxham; Margaret S Cheung,There are two dominant traditions in neuroscience and psychology to study categoricaldecisions: perceptual and value-based decisionmaking. Perceptual decision-makingfocuses on how accurate decisions are reached by resolving perceptual uncertainty. Invalue-based decisionmaking; the stimuli themselves are not ambiguous; rather the value orutility of different options needs to be estimated based on prior experience. In both cases;the goal is to systematically manipulate different features of the environment in order tounderstand how they guide behavior.,Encyclopedia of Computational Neuroscience,2015,*
