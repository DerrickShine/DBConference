Private queries in location based services: anonymizers are not necessary,Gabriel Ghinita; Panos Kalnis; Ali Khoshgozaran; Cyrus Shahabi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Mobile devices equipped with positioning capabilities (eg; GPS) can ask location-dependent queries to Location Based Services (LBS). To protect privacy; the user locationmust not be disclosed. Existing solutions utilize a trusted anonymizer between the users andthe LBS. This approach has several drawbacks:(i) All users must trust the third partyanonymizer; which is a single point of attack.(ii) A large number of cooperating; trustworthyusers is needed.(iii) Privacy is guaranteed only for a single snapshot of user locations; usersare not protected against correlation attacks (eg; history of user movement). We propose anovel framework to support private location-dependent queries; based on the theoreticalwork on Private Information Retrieval (PIR). Our framework does not require a trusted thirdparty; since privacy is achieved via cryptographic techniques.

Preventing location-based identity inference in anonymous spatial queries,Panos Kalnis; Gabriel Ghinita; Kyriakos Mouratidis; Dimitris Papadias,The increasing trend of embedding positioning capabilities (for example; GPS) in mobiledevices facilitates the widespread use of location-based services. For such applications tosucceed; privacy and confidentiality are essential. Existing privacy-enhancing techniquesrely on encryption to safeguard communication channels; and on pseudonyms to protectuser identities. Nevertheless; the query contents may disclose the physical location of theuser. In this paper; we present a framework for preventing location-based identity inferenceof users who issue spatial queries to location-based services. We propose transformationsbased on the well-established K-anonymity concept to compute exact answers for range andnearest neighbor search; without revealing the query source.

PRIVE: anonymous location-based queries in distributed mobile systems,Gabriel Ghinita; Panos Kalnis; Spiros Skiadopoulos,Abstract Nowadays; mobile users with global positioning devices canaccess Location BasedServices (LBS) and query about pointsof interest in their proximity. For such applications tosucceed; privacy and confidentiality are essential. Encryptionalone is not adequate;although it safeguards the systemagainst eavesdroppers; the queries themselves maydisclosethe location and identity of the user. Recently; there havebeen proposed centralizedarchitectures based on K-anonymity; which utilize an intermediate anonymizer betweenthemobile users and the LBS. However; the anonymizer mustbe updated continuously withthe current locations of allusers. Moreover; the complete knowledge of the entiresystemposes a security threat; if the anonymizer is compromised. In this paper we addresstwo issues:(i) We show thatexisting approaches may fail to provide spatial anonymityfor …,Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web,2007,462
Efficient OLAP operations in spatial data warehouses,Dimitris Papadias; Panos Kalnis; Jun Zhang; Yufei Tao,Abstract Spatial databases store information about the position of individual objects inspace. In many applications however; such as traffic supervision or mobile communications;only summarized data; like the number of cars in an area or phones serviced by a cell; isrequired. Although this information can be obtained from transactional spatial databases; itscomputation is expensive; rendering online processing inapplicable. Driven by the non-spatial paradigm; spatial data warehouses can be constructed to accelerate spatial OLAPoperations. In this paper we consider the star-schema and we focus on the spatialdimensions. Unlike the non-spatial case; the groupings and the hierarchies can benumerous and unknown at design time; therefore the well-known materialization techniquesare not directly applicable. In order to address this problem; we construct an ad-hoc …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2001,434
On discovering moving clusters in spatio-temporal data,Panos Kalnis; Nikos Mamoulis; Spiridon Bakiras,Abstract A moving cluster is defined by a set of objects that move close to each other for along time interval. Real-life examples are a group of migrating animals; a convoy of carsmoving in a city; etc. We study the discovery of moving clusters in a database of objecttrajectories. The difference of this problem compared to clustering trajectories and miningmovement patterns is that the identity of a moving cluster remains unchanged while itslocation and content may change over time. For example; while a group of animals aremigrating; some animals may leave the group or new animals may enter it. We provide aformal definition for moving clusters and describe three algorithms for their automaticdiscovery:(i) a straight-forward method based on the definition;(ii) a more efficient methodwhich avoids redundant checks and (iii) an approximate algorithm which trades accuracy …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2005,412
Fast data anonymization with low information loss,Gabriel Ghinita; Panagiotis Karras; Panos Kalnis; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Recent research studied the problem of publishing microdata without revealingsensitive information; leading to the privacy preserving paradigms of k-anonymity and l-diversity. k-anonymity protects against the identification of an individual's record. l-diversity;in addition; safeguards against the association of an individual with specific sensitiveinformation. However; existing approaches suffer from at least one of the followingdrawbacks:(i) The information loss metrics are counter-intuitive and fail to capture datainaccuracies inflicted for the sake of privacy.(ii) l-diversity is solved by techniques developedfor the simpler k-anonymity problem; which introduces unnecessary inaccuracies.(iii) Theanonymization process is inefficient in terms of computation and I/O cost. In this paper wepropose a framework for efficient privacy preservation that addresses these deficiencies …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,269
Privacy-preserving anonymization of set-valued data,Manolis Terrovitis; Nikos Mamoulis; Panos Kalnis,Abstract In this paper we study the problem of protecting privacy in the publication of set-valued data. Consider a collection of transactional data that contains detailed informationabout items bought together by individuals. Even after removing all personal characteristicsof the buyer; which can serve as links to his identity; the publication of such data is stillsubject to privacy attacks from adversaries who have partial knowledge about the set. Unlikemost previous works; we do not distinguish data as sensitive and non-sensitive; but weconsider them both as potential quasi-identifiers and potential sensitive data; depending onthe point of view of the adversary. We define a new version of the k-anonymity guarantee;the k m-anonymity; to limit the effects of the data dimensionality and we propose efficientalgorithms to transform the database. Our anonymization model relies on generalization …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,266
Mizan: a system for dynamic load balancing in large-scale graph processing,Zuhair Khayyat; Karim Awara; Amani Alonazi; Hani Jamjoom; Dan Williams; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Pregel [23] was recently introduced as a scalable graph mining system that canprovide significant performance improvements over traditional MapReduceimplementations. Existing implementations focus primarily on graph partitioning as apreprocessing step to balance computation across compute nodes. In this paper; weexamine the runtime characteristics of a Pregel system. We show that graph partitioningalone is insufficient for minimizing end-to-end computation. Especially where data is verylarge or the runtime behavior of the algorithm is unknown; an adaptive approach is needed.To this end; we introduce Mizan; a Pregel system that achieves efficient load balancing tobetter adapt to changes in computing needs. Unlike known implementations of Pregel;Mizan does not assume any a priori knowledge of the structure of the graph or behavior of …,Proceedings of the 8th ACM European Conference on Computer Systems,2013,218
On the anonymization of sparse high-dimensional data,Gabriel Ghinita; Yufei Tao; Panos Kalnis,Existing research on privacy-preserving data publishing focuses on relational data: in thiscontext; the objective is to enforce privacy-preserving paradigms; such as k-anonymity and l-diversity; while minimizing the information loss incurred in the anonymizing process (iemaximize data utility). However; existing techniques adopt an indexing-or clustering-basedapproach; and work well for fixed-schema data; with low dimensionality. Nevertheless;certain applications require privacy-preserving publishing of transaction data (or basketdata); which involves hundreds or even thousands of dimensions; rendering existingmethods unusable. We propose a novel anonymization method for sparse high-dimensionaldata. We employ a particular representation that captures the correlation in the underlyingdata; and facilitates the formation of anonymized groups with low information loss. We …,Data Engineering; 2008.

MOBIHIDE: a mobilea peer-to-peer system for anonymous location-based queries,Gabriel Ghinita; Panos Kalnis; Spiros Skiadopoulos,Abstract Modern mobile phones and PDAs are equipped with positioning capabilities (eg;GPS). Users can access public location-based services (eg; Google Maps) and ask spatialqueries. Although communication is encrypted; privacy and confidentiality remain majorconcerns; since the queries may disclose the location and identity of the user. Commonly;spatial K-anonymity is employed to hide the query initiator among a group of K users.However; existing work either fails to guarantee privacy; or exhibits unacceptably longresponse time. In this paper we propose MobiHide; a Peer-to-Peer system for anonymouslocation-based queries; which addresses these problems. MobiHide employs the Hilbertspace-filling curve to map the 2-D locations of mobile users to 1-D space. The transformedlocations are indexed by a Chord-based distributed hash table; which is formed by the …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2007,199
Quality and efficiency in high dimensional nearest neighbor search,Yufei Tao; Ke Yi; Cheng Sheng; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Nearest neighbor (NN) search in high dimensional space is an important problemin many applications. Ideally; a practical solution (i) should be implementable in a relationaldatabase; and (ii) its query cost should grow sub-linearly with the dataset size; regardless ofthe data and query distributions. Despite the bulk of NN literature; no solution fulfills bothrequirements; except locality sensitive hashing (LSH). The existing LSH implementationsare either rigorous or adhoc. Rigorous-LSH ensures good quality of query results; butrequires expensive space and query cost. Although adhoc-LSH is more efficient; itabandons quality control; ie; the neighbor it outputs can be arbitrarily bad. As a result;currently no method is able to ensure both quality and efficiency simultaneously in practice.Motivated by this; we propose a new access method called the locality sensitive B-tree …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,178
An adaptive peer-to-peer network for distributed caching of olap results,Panos Kalnis; Wee Siong Ng; Beng Chin Ooi; Dimitris Papadias; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems are becoming increasingly popular as they enableusers to exchange digital information by participating in complex networks. Such systemsare inexpensive; easy to use; highly scalable and do not require central administration.Despite their advantages; however; limited work has been done on employing databasesystems on top of P2P networks. Here we propose the PeerOLAP architecture for supportingOn-Line Analytical Processing queries. A large number low-end clients; each containing acache with the most useful results; are connected through an arbitrary P2P network. If aquery cannot be answered locally (ie by using the cache contents of the computer where it isissued); it is propagated through the network until a peer that has cached the answer isfound. An answer may also be constructed by partial results from many peers. Thus …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,162
Similarity evaluation on tree-structured data,Rui Yang; Panos Kalnis; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Tree-structured data are becoming ubiquitous nowadays and manipulating thembased on similarity is essential for many applications. The generally accepted similaritymeasure for trees is the edit distance. Although similarity search has been extensivelystudied; searching for similar trees is still an open problem due to the high complexity ofcomputing the tree edit distance. In this paper; we propose to transform tree-structured datainto an approximate numerical multidimensional vector which encodes the original structureinformation. We prove that the L 1 distance of the corresponding vectors; whosecomputational complexity is O (| T 1|+| T 2|); forms a lower bound for the edit distancebetween trees. Based on the theoretical analysis; we describe a novel algorithm whichembeds the proposed distance into a filter-and-refine framework to process similarity …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,157
Authenticated join processing in outsourced databases,Yin Yang; Dimitris Papadias; Stavros Papadopoulos; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Database outsourcing requires that a query server constructs a proof of resultcorrectness; which can be verified by the client using the data owner's signature. Previousauthentication techniques deal with range queries on a single relation using anauthenticated data structure (ADS). On the other hand; authenticated join processing isinherently more complex than ranges since only the base relations (but not theircombination) are signed by the owner. In this paper; we present three novel join algorithmsdepending on the ADS availability:(i) Authenticated Indexed Sort Merge Join (AISM); whichutilizes a single ADS on the join attribute;(ii) Authenticated Index Merge Join (AIM) thatrequires an ADS (on the join attribute) for both relations; and (iii) Authenticated Sort MergeJoin (ASM); which does not rely on any ADS. We experimentally demonstrate that the …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,110
View selection using randomized search,Panos Kalnis; Nikos Mamoulis; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract An important issue in data warehouse development is the selection of a set of viewsto materialize in order to accelerate On-line analytical processing queries; given certainspace and maintenance time constraints. Existing methods provide good results but theirhigh execution cost limits their applicability for large problems. In this paper; we explore theapplication of randomized; local search algorithms to the view selection problem. Theefficiency of the proposed techniques is evaluated using synthetic datasets; which cover awide range of data and query distributions. The results show that randomized searchmethods provide near-optimal solutions in limited time; being robust to data and query skew.Furthermore; they can be easily adapted for various versions of the problem; including thesimultaneous existence of size and time constraints; and view selection in dynamic …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2002,106
Enabling search services on outsourced private spatial data,Man Lung Yiu; Gabriel Ghinita; Christian S Jensen; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Cloud computing services enable organizations and individuals to outsource themanagement of their data to a service provider in order to save on hardware investmentsand reduce maintenance costs. Only authorized users are allowed to access the data.Nobody else; including the service provider; should be able to view the data. For instance; areal-estate company that owns a large database of properties wants to allow its payingcustomers to query for houses according to location. On the other hand; the untrustedservice provider should not be able to learn the property locations and; eg; selling theinformation to a competitor. To tackle the problem; we propose to transform the locationdatasets before uploading them to the service provider. The paper develops a spatialtransformation that re-distributes the locations in space; and it also proposes a …,The VLDB Journal,2010,104
Location diversity: Enhanced privacy protection in location based services,Mingqiang Xue; Panos Kalnis; Hung Keng Pung,Abstract Location-based Services are emerging as popular applications in pervasivecomputing. Spatial k-anonymity is used in Location-based Services to protect privacy; byhiding the association of a specific query with a specific user. Unfortunately; this approachfails in many practical cases such as:(i) personalized services; where the user identity isrequired; or (ii) applications involving groups of users (eg; employees of the samecompany); in this case; associating a query to any member of the group; violates privacy. Inthis paper; we introduce the concept of Location Diversity; which solves the above-mentioned problems. Location Diversity improves Spatial k-anonymity by ensuring that eachquery can be associated with at least ℓ different semantic locations (eg; school; shop;hospital; etc). We present an attack model that maps each observed query to a linear …,International Symposium on Location-and Context-Awareness,2009,100
Grami: Frequent subgraph and pattern mining in a single large graph,Mohammed Elseidy; Ehab Abdelhamid; Spiros Skiadopoulos; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Mining frequent subgraphs is an important operation on graphs; it is defined asfinding all subgraphs that appear frequently in a database according to a given frequencythreshold. Most existing work assumes a database of many small graphs; but modernapplications; such as social networks; citation graphs; or protein-protein interactions inbioinformatics; are modeled as a single large graph. In this paper we present GraMi; a novelframework for frequent subgraph mining in a single large graph. GraMi undertakes a novelapproach that only finds the minimal set of instances to satisfy the frequency threshold andavoids the costly enumeration of all instances required by previous approaches. Weaccompany our approach with a heuristic and optimizations that significantly improveperformance. Additionally; we present an extension of GraMi that mines frequent patterns …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,89

User oriented trajectory search for trip recommendation,Shuo Shang; Ruogu Ding; Bo Yuan; Kexin Xie; Kai Zheng; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Trajectory sharing and searching have received significant attentions in recentyears. In this paper; we propose and investigate a novel problem called User OrientedTrajectory Search (UOTS) for trip recommendation. In contrast to conventional trajectorysearch by locations (spatial domain only); we consider both spatial and textual domains inthe new UOTS query. Given a trajectory data set; the query input contains a set of intendedplaces given by the traveler and a set of textual attributes describing the traveler'spreference. If a trajectory is connecting/close to the specified query locations; and the textualattributes of the trajectory are similar to the traveler'e preference; it will be recommended tothe traveler for reference. This type of queries can bring significant benefits to travelers inmany popular applications such as trip planning and recommendation.

Answering similarity queries in peer-to-peer networks,Panos Kalnis; Wee Siong Ng; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract A variety of peer-to-peer (P2P) systems for sharing digital information are currentlyavailable and most of them perform searching by exact key matching. In this paper we focuson similarity searching and describe FuzzyPeer; a generic broadcast-based P2P systemwhich supports a wide range of fuzzy queries. As a case study we present an image retrievalapplication implemented on top of FuzzyPeer. Users provide sample images whose sets offeatures are propagated through the peers. The answer consists of the top-k most similarimages within the query horizon. In our system the participation of peers is ad hoc anddynamic; their functionality is symmetric and there is no centralized index. In order to avoidflooding the network with messages; we develop a technique that takes advantage of thefuzzy nature of the queries. Specifically; some queries are “frozen” inside the network …,Information Systems,2006,79

Efficient and accurate nearest neighbor and closest pair search in high-dimensional space,Yufei Tao; Ke Yi; Cheng Sheng; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Nearest Neighbor (NN) search in high-dimensional space is an important problemin many applications. From the database perspective; a good solution needs to have twoproperties:(i) it can be easily incorporated in a relational database; and (ii) its query costshould increase sublinearly with the dataset size; regardless of the data and querydistributions. Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is a well-known methodology fulfilling bothrequirements; but its current implementations either incur expensive space and query cost;or abandon its theoretical guarantee on the quality of query results. Motivated by this; weimprove LSH by proposing an access method called the Locality-Sensitive B-tree (LSB-tree)to enable fast; accurate; high-dimensional NN search in relational databases.

Providing k-anonymity in location based services,Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Panos Kalnis; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract The offering of anonymity in relational databases has attracted a great deal ofattention in the database community during the last decade [4]. Among the different solutionapproaches that have been proposed to tackle this problem; K-anonymity has receivedincreased attention and has been extensively studied in various forms. New forms of datathat come into existence; like location data capturing user movement; pave the way for theoffering of cutting edge services such as the prevailing Location Based Services (LBSs).Given that these services assume an in-depth knowledge of the mobile users' whereaboutsit is certain that the assumed knowledge may breach the privacy of the users. Thus; concreteapproaches are necessary to preserve the anonymity of the mobile users when requestingLBSs.

Outsourcing search services on private spatial data,Man Lung Yiu; Gabriel Ghinita; Christian S Jensen; Panos Kalnis,Social networking and content sharing service providers; eg; Facebook and Google Maps;enable their users to upload and share a variety of user-generated content; includinglocation data such as points of interest. Users wish to share location data through an(untrusted) service provider such that trusted friends can perform spatial queries on the data.We solve the problem by transforming the location data before uploading them. Wecontribute spatial transformations that re-distribute locations in space and a transformationthat employs cryptographic techniques. The data owner selects transformation keys andshares them with the trusted friends. Without the keys; it is infeasible for an attacker toreconstruct the exact original data points from the transformed points.

SABRE: a Sensitive Attribute Bucketization and REdistribution framework for t-closeness,Jianneng Cao; Panagiotis Karras; Panos Kalnis; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Today; the publication of microdata poses a privacy threat: anonymous personalrecords can be re-identified using third data sources. Past research has tried to develop aconcept of privacy guarantee that an anonymized data set should satisfy before publication;culminating in the notion of t-closeness. To satisfy t-closeness; the records in a data set needto be grouped into Equivalence Classes (ECs); such that each EC contains records ofindistinguishable quasi-identifier values; and its local distribution of sensitive attribute (SA)values conforms to the global table distribution of SA values. However; despite this progress;previous research has not offered an anonymization algorithm tailored for t-closeness. In thispaper; we cover this gap with SABRE; a SA Bucketization and REdistribution framework for t-closeness. SABRE first greedily partitions a table into buckets of similar SA values and …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2011,65
Outsourced similarity search on metric data assets,Man Lung Yiu; Ira Assent; Christian S Jensen; Panos Kalnis,This paper considers a cloud computing setting in which similarity querying of metric data isoutsourced to a service provider. The data is to be revealed only to trusted users; not to theservice provider or anyone else. Users query the server for the most similar data objects to aquery example. Outsourcing offers the data owner scalability and a low-initial investment.The need for privacy may be due to the data being sensitive (eg; in medicine); valuable (eg;in astronomy); or otherwise confidential. Given this setting; the paper presents techniquesthat transform the data prior to supplying it to the service provider for similarity queries on thetransformed data. Our techniques provide interesting trade-offs between query cost andaccuracy. They are then further extended to offer an intuitive privacy guarantee. Empiricalstudies with real data demonstrate that the techniques are capable of offering privacy …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,63

A reciprocal framework for spatial k-anonymity,Gabriel Ghinita; Keliang Zhao; Dimitris Papadias; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Spatial K-anonymity (SKA) exploits the concept of K-anonymity in order to protectthe identity of users from location-based attacks. The main idea of SKA is to replace theexact location of a user U with an anonymizing spatial region (ASR) that contains at least K−1 other users; so that an attacker can pinpoint U with probability at most 1/K. Simplygenerating an ASR that includes K users does not guarantee SKA. Previous work definedthe reciprocity property as a sufficient condition for SKA. However; the only existingreciprocal method; Hilbert Cloak; relies on a specialized data structure. In contrast; wepropose a general framework for implementing reciprocal algorithms using any existingspatial index on the user locations. We discuss ASR construction methods with differenttradeoffs on effectiveness (ie; ASR size) and efficiency (ie; construction cost). Then; we …,Information Systems,2010,57
Approximate and exact hybrid algorithms for private nearest-neighbor queries with database protection,Gabriel Ghinita; Panos Kalnis; Murat Kantarcioglu; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Mobile devices with global positioning capabilities allow users to retrieve points ofinterest (POI) in their proximity. To protect user privacy; it is important not to disclose exactuser coordinates to un-trusted entities that provide location-based services. Currently; thereare two main approaches to protect the location privacy of users:(i) hiding locations insidecloaking regions (CRs) and (ii) encrypting location data using private information retrieval(PIR) protocols. Previous work focused on finding good trade-offs between privacy andperformance of user protection techniques; but disregarded the important issue of protectingthe POI dataset D. For instance; location cloaking requires large-sized CRs; leading toexcessive disclosure of POIs (O (| D|) in the worst case).

Proxy-server architectures for olap,Panos Kalnis; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Data warehouses have been successfully employed for assisting decision makingby offering a global view of the enterprise data and providing mechanisms for On-LineAnalytical processing. Traditionally; data warehouses are utilized within the limits of anenterprise or organization. The growth of Internet and WWW however; has created newopportunities for data sharing among ad-hoc; geographically spanned and possibly mobileusers. Since it is impractical for each enterprise to set up a worldwide infrastructure; currentlysuch applications are handled by the central warehouse. This often yields poorperformance; due to overloading of the central server and low transfer rate of the network. Inthis paper we propose an architecture for OLAP cache servers (OCS). An OCS is theequivalent of a proxy-server for web documents; but it is designed to accommodate data …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,46

Generalized multidimensional data mapping and query processing,Rui Zhang; Panos Kalnis; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Multidimensional data points can be mapped to one-dimensional space to exploitsingle dimensional indexing structures such as the B &plus;-tree. In this article we present aGeneralized structure for data Mapping and query Processing (GiMP); which supportsextensible mapping methods and query processing. GiMP can be easily customized tobehave like many competent indexing mechanisms for multi-dimensional indexing; such asthe UB-Tree; the Pyramid technique; the iMinMax; and the iDistance. Besides being anextendible indexing structure; GiMP also serves as a framework to study the characteristicsof the mapping and hence the efficiency of the indexing scheme.

Personalized trajectory matching in spatial networks,Shuo Shang; Ruogu Ding; Kai Zheng; Christian S Jensen; Panos Kalnis; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract With the increasing availability of moving-object tracking data; trajectory search andmatching is increasingly important. We propose and investigate a novel problem calledpersonalized trajectory matching (PTM). In contrast to conventional trajectory similaritysearch by spatial distance only; PTM takes into account the significance of each samplepoint in a query trajectory. A PTM query takes a trajectory with user-specified weights foreach sample point in the trajectory as its argument. It returns the trajectory in an argumentdata set with the highest similarity to the query trajectory. We believe that this type of querymay bring significant benefits to users in many popular applications such as route planning;carpooling; friend recommendation; traffic analysis; urban computing; and location-basedservices in general. PTM query processing faces two challenges: how to prune the search …,The VLDB Journal,2014,40
Multi-query optimization for on-line analytical processing,Panos Kalnis; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Multi-dimensional expressions (MDX) provide an interface for asking severalrelated OLAP queries simultaneously. An interesting problem is how to optimize theexecution of an MDX query; given that most data warehouses maintain a set of redundantmaterialized views to accelerate OLAP operations. A number of greedy and approximationalgorithms have been proposed for different versions of the problem. In this paper weevaluate experimentally their performance; concluding that they do not scale well for realisticworkloads. Motivated by this fact; we develop two novel greedy algorithms. Our algorithmsconstruct the execution plan in a top–down manner by identifying in each step the mostbeneficial view; instead of finding the most promising query.

It is used in a variety ofapplications such as bioinformatics; time series analysis; clustering; text editing and datacompression. However; when the string and the resulting suffix tree are too large to fit intothe main memory; most existing construction algorithms become very inefficient. This paperpresents a disk-based suffix tree construction method; called Elastic Range (ERa); whichworks efficiently with very long strings that are much larger than the available memory. ERapartitions the tree construction process horizontally and vertically and minimizes I/Os bydynamically adjusting the horizontal partitions independently for each vertical partition;based on the evolving shape of the tree and the available memory. Where appropriate; ERaalso groups vertical partitions together to amortize the I/O cost. We developed a serial …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,39
DEEP: a general computational framework for predicting enhancers,Dimitrios Kleftogiannis; Panos Kalnis; Vladimir B Bajic,Abstract Transcription regulation in multicellular eukaryotes is orchestrated by a number ofDNA functional elements located at gene regulatory regions. Some regulatory regions (egenhancers) are located far away from the gene they affect. Identification of distal regulatoryelements is a challenge for the bioinformatics research. Although existing methodologiesincreased the number of computationally predicted enhancers; performance inconsistencyof computational models across different cell-lines; class imbalance within the learning setsand ad hoc rules for selecting enhancer candidates for supervised learning; are some keyquestions that require further examination. In this study we developed DEEP; a novelensemble prediction framework. DEEP integrates three components with diversecharacteristics that streamline the analysis of enhancer's properties in a great variety of …,Nucleic acids research,2014,36
Content-based retrieval using heuristic search,Dimitris Papadias; Marios Mantzourogiannis; Panos Kalnis; Nikos Mamoulis; Ishfaq Ahmad,ABSTRACT The fast growth of multimedia information in image and video databases hastriggered research on efficient retrieval methods. This paper deals with structural queries; atype of content-based retrieval where similarity is not defined on visual properties such ascolor and texture; but on object relations in space. We propose the application of heuristicalgorithms which provide good; but not necessarily optimal; solutions in a pre-determinedtime period; and compare our approach with systematic search methods which areguaranteed to find optimal solutions but require exponential time in the worst case. Thequality of the output is calculated using a relation framework which is an extension of Allen'srelations. With this framework our methods can be applied in multiple resolutions anddimensions; thus covering a wide range of applications in spatial; multimedia and video …,Proceedings of the 22nd annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,1999,31
DWFS: a wrapper feature selection tool based on a parallel genetic algorithm,Othman Soufan; Dimitrios Kleftogiannis; Panos Kalnis; Vladimir B Bajic,Many scientific problems can be formulated as classification tasks. Data that harbor relevantinformation are usually described by a large number of features. Frequently; many of thesefeatures are irrelevant for the class prediction. The efficient implementation of classificationmodels requires identification of suitable combinations of features. The smaller number offeatures reduces the problem's dimensionality and may result in higher classificationperformance. We developed DWFS; a web-based tool that allows for efficient selection offeatures for a variety of problems. DWFS follows the wrapper paradigm and applies a searchstrategy based on Genetic Algorithms (GAs). A parallel GA implementation examines andevaluates simultaneously large number of candidate collections of features. DWFS alsointegrates various filtering methods that may be applied as a pre-processing step in the …,PloS one,2015,27
Comparing memory-efficient genome assemblers on stand-alone and cloud infrastructures,Dimitrios Kleftogiannis; Panos Kalnis; Vladimir B Bajic,A fundamental problem in bioinformatics is genome assembly. Next-generation sequencing(NGS) technologies produce large volumes of fragmented genome reads; which requirelarge amounts of memory to assemble the complete genome efficiently. With recentimprovements in DNA sequencing technologies; it is expected that the memory footprintrequired for the assembly process will increase dramatically and will emerge as a limitingfactor in processing widely available NGS-generated reads. In this report; we comparecurrent memory-efficient techniques for genome assembly with respect to quality; memoryconsumption and execution time. Our experiments prove that it is possible to generate draftassemblies of reasonable quality on conventional multi-purpose computers with very limitedavailable memory by choosing suitable assembly methods. Our study reveals the …,PLoS One,2013,24
Real datasets for file-sharing peer-to-peer systems,Shen Tat Goh; Panos Kalnis; Spiridon Bakiras; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract The fundamental drawback of unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) networks is theflooding-based query processing protocol that seriously limits their scalability. As a result; asignificant amount of research work has focused on designing efficient search protocols thatreduce the overall communication cost. What is lacking; however; is the availability of realdata; regarding the exact content of users' libraries and the queries that these users ask.Using trace-driven simulations will clearly generate more meaningful results and furtherillustrate the efficiency of a generic query processing protocol under a real-life scenario.Motivated by this fact; we developed a Gnutella-style probe and collected detailed data overa period of two months. They involve around 4;500 users and contain the exact files sharedby each user; together with any available metadata (eg; artist for songs) and information …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2005,24
Discovery of path nearby clusters in spatial networks,Shuo Shang; Kai Zheng; Christian S Jensen; Bin Yang; Panos Kalnis; Guohe Li; Ji-Rong Wen,The discovery of regions of interest in large cities is an important challenge. We propose andinvestigate a novel query called the path nearby cluster (PNC) query that finds regions ofpotential interest (eg; sightseeing places and commercial districts) with respect to a user-specified travel route. Given a set of spatial objects O (eg; POIs; geo-tagged photos; or geo-tagged tweets) and a query route q; if a cluster c has high spatial-object density and isspatially close to q; it is returned by the query (a cluster is a circular region defined by acenter and a radius). This query aims to bring important benefits to users in popularapplications such as trip planning and location recommendation. Efficient computation of thePNC query faces two challenges: how to prune the search space during query processing;and how to identify clusters with high density effectively. To address these challenges; a …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,21
Progress and challenges in bioinformatics approaches for enhancer identification,Dimitrios Kleftogiannis; Panos Kalnis; Vladimir B Bajic,Enhancers are cis-acting DNA elements that play critical roles in distal regulation of geneexpression. Identifying enhancers is an important step for understanding distinct geneexpression programs that may reflect normal and pathogenic cellular conditions.Experimental identification of enhancers is constrained by the set of conditions used in theexperiment. This requires multiple experiments to identify enhancers; as they can be activeunder specific cellular conditions but not in different cell types/tissues or cellular states. Thishas opened prospects for computational prediction methods that can be used for high-throughput identification of putative enhancers to complement experimental approaches.Potential functions and properties of predicted enhancers have been catalogued andsummarized in several enhancer-oriented databases.

Active caching of on-line-analytical-processing queries in www proxies,Thanasis Loukopoulos; Panos Kalnis; Ishfaq Ahmad; Dimitris Papadias,The Internet is offering more than just regular Web pages to the users. Decision makers cannow issue analytical; as opposed to transactional; queries that involve massive data (suchas; aggregations of millions of rows in a relational database) in order to identify useful trendsand patterns. Such queries are referred to as On-Line-Analytical-Processing (OLAP)queries. Typically; pages carrying query results do not exhibit temporal locality and;therefore; are not considered for caching at WWW proxies. In OLAP processing; thisbecomes a major hurdle as the cost of such queries is much higher than traditionaltransactional queries. This paper proposes a systematic technique to reduce the responsetime for OLAP queries originating from geographically distributed private LANs and issuedthrough the Web towards the central data warehouse (DW) of an enterprise.

Collective travel planning in spatial networks,Shuo Shang; Lisi Chen; Zhewei Wei; Christian S Jensen; Ji-Rong Wen; Panos Kalnis,Travel planning and recommendation are important aspects of transportation. We proposeand investigate a novel Collective Travel Planning (CTP) query that finds the lowest-costroute connecting multiple sources and a destination; via at most $ k $ meeting points. Whenmultiple travelers target the same destination (eg; a stadium or a theater); they may want toassemble at meeting points and then go together to the destination by public transport toreduce their global travel cost (eg; energy; money; or greenhouse-gas emissions). This typeof functionality holds the potential to bring significant benefits to society and theenvironment; such as reducing energy consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions;enabling smarter and greener transportation; and reducing traffic congestions. The CTPquery is Max SNP-hard. To compute the query efficiently; we develop two algorithms …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,19
Karect: accurate correction of substitution; insertion and deletion errors for next-generation sequencing data,Amin Allam; Panos Kalnis; Victor Solovyev,Abstract Motivation: Next-generation sequencing generates large amounts of data affectedby errors in the form of substitutions; insertions or deletions of bases. Error correction basedon the high-coverage information; typically improves de novo assembly. Most existing toolscan correct substitution errors only; some support insertions and deletions; but accuracy inmany cases is low. Results: We present Karect; a novel error correction technique based onmultiple alignment. Our approach supports substitution; insertion and deletion errors. It canhandle non-uniform coverage as well as moderately covered areas of the sequencedgenome. Experiments with data from Illumina; 454 FLX and Ion Torrent sequencingmachines demonstrate that Karect is more accurate than previous methods; both in terms ofcorrecting individual-bases errors (up to 10% increase in accuracy gain) and post de …,Bioinformatics,2015,19
Dcmp: A distributed cycle minimization protocol for peer-to-peer networks,Zhenzhou Zhu; Panos Kalnis; Spiridon Bakiras,Broadcast-based peer-to-peer (P2P) networks; including flat (for example; Gnutella) and two-layer superpeer implementations (for example; Kazaa); are extremely popular nowadaysdue to their simplicity; ease of deployment; and versatility. The unstructured networktopology; however; contains many cyclic paths; which introduce numerous duplicatemessages in the system. Although such messages can be identified and ignored; they stillconsume a large proportion of the bandwidth and other resources; causing bottlenecks inthe entire network. In this paper; we describe the distributed cycle minimization protocol(DCMP); a dynamic fully decentralized protocol that significantly reduces the duplicatemessages by eliminating unnecessary cycles. As queries are transmitted through the peers;DCMP identifies the problematic paths and attempts to break the cycles while maintaining …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2008,19
Accelerating SPARQL queries by exploiting hash-based locality and adaptive partitioning,Razen Harbi; Ibrahim Abdelaziz; Panos Kalnis; Nikos Mamoulis; Yasser Ebrahim; Majed Sahli,Abstract State-of-the-art distributed RDF systems partition data across multiple computernodes (workers). Some systems perform cheap hash partitioning; which may result inexpensive query evaluation. Others try to minimize inter-node communication; whichrequires an expensive data preprocessing phase; leading to a high startup cost. Aprioriknowledge of the query workload has also been used to create partitions; which; however;are static and do not adapt to workload changes. In this paper; we propose AdPart; adistributed RDF system; which addresses the shortcomings of previous work. First; AdPartapplies lightweight partitioning on the initial data; which distributes triples by hashing ontheir subjects; this renders its startup overhead low. At the same time; the locality-awarequery optimizer of AdPart takes full advantage of the partitioning to (1) support the fully …,The VLDB Journal,2016,17
Delineating social network data anonymization via random edge perturbation,Mingqiang Xue; Panagiotis Karras; Raissi Chedy; Panos Kalnis; Hung Keng Pung,Abstract Social network data analysis raises concerns about the privacy of related entities orindividuals. To address this issue; organizations can publish data after simply replacing theidentities of individuals with pseudonyms; leaving the overall structure of the social networkunchanged. However; it has been shown that attacks based on structural identification (eg; awalk-based attack) enable an adversary to re-identify selected individuals in an anonymizednetwork. In this paper we explore the capacity of techniques based on random edgeperturbation to thwart such attacks. We theoretically establish that any kind of structuralidentification attack can effectively be prevented using random edge perturbation and showthat; surprisingly; important properties of the whole network; as well as of subgraphs thereof;can be accurately calculated and hence data analysis tasks performed on the perturbed …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,17

Privacy-preserving publication of user locations in the proximity of sensitive sites,Bharath Krishnamachari; Gabriel Ghinita; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Location-based services; such as on-line maps; obtain the exact location ofnumerous mobile users. This information can be published for research or commercialpurposes. However; privacy may be compromised if a user is in the proximity of a sensitivesite (eg; hospital). To preserve privacy; existing methods employ the K-anonymity paradigmto hide each affected user in a group that contains at least K− 1 other users. Nevertheless;current solutions have the following drawbacks:(i) they may fail to achieve anonymity;(ii) theymay cause excessive distortion of location data and (iii) they incur high computational cost.In this paper; we define formally the attack model and discuss the conditions that guaranteeprivacy. Then; we propose two algorithms which employ 2-D to 1-D transformations toanonymize the locations of users in the proximity of sensitive sites.

Optimization of spatial joins on mobile devices,Nikos Mamoulis; Panos Kalnis; Spiridon Bakiras; Xiaochen Li,Abstract Mobile devices like PDAs are capable of retrieving information from various types ofservices. In many cases; the user requests cannot directly be processed by the serviceproviders; if their hosts have limited query capabilities or the query combines data fromvarious sources; which do not collaborate with each other. In this paper; we present aframework for optimizing spatial join queries that belong to this class. We presume that theconnection and queries are ad-hoc; there is no mediator available and the services are non-collaborative. We also assume that the services are not willing to share their statistics orindexes with the client. We retrieve statistics dynamically in order to generate a low-costexecution plan; while considering the storage and computational power limitations of thePDA. Since acquiring the statistics causes overhead; we describe an adaptive algorithm …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2003,17
Anonymity in unstructured data,Manolis Terrovitis; Nikos Mamoulis; Panos Kalnis,Abstract In this paper we study the problem of protecting privacy in the publication of set-valued data. Consider a collection of transactional data that contains detailed informationabout items bought together by individuals. Even after removing all personal characteristicsof the buyer; which can serve as links to his identity; the publication of such data is stillsubject to privacy attacks from adversaries who have partial knowledge about the set. Unlikemost previous works; we do not distinguish data as sensitive and non-sensitive; but weconsider them both as potential quasi-identifiers and potential sensitive data; depending onthe point of view of the adversary. We define a new version of the k-anonymity guarantee;the km-anonymity; to limit the effects of the data dimensionality and we propose efficientalgorithms to transform the database. Our anonymization model relies on generalization …,Proc. of International Conference on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB),2008,16
Hierarchical constraint satisfaction in spatial databases,Dimitris Papadias; Panos Kalnis; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Several content-based queries in spatial databases and geographic informationsystems (GISs) can be modelled and processed as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs).Regular CSP algorithms; however; work for main memory retrieval without utilizing indices toprune the search space. This paper shows how systematic and local search techniques cantake advantage of the hierarchical decomposition of space; preserved by spatial datastructures; to efficiently guide search. We study the conditions under which hierarchicalconstraint satisfaction outperforms traditional methods with extensive experimentation.,Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence,1999,16
Lightning fast and space efficient inequality joins,Zuhair Khayyat; William Lucia; Meghna Singh; Mourad Ouzzani; Paolo Papotti; Jorge-Arnulfo Quiané-Ruiz; Nan Tang; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Inequality joins; which join relational tables on inequality conditions; are used invarious applications. While there have been a wide range of optimization methods for joinsin database systems; from algorithms such as sort-merge join and band join; to variousindices such as B+-tree; R*-tree and Bitmap; inequality joins have received little attentionand queries containing such joins are usually very slow. In this paper; we introduce fastinequality join algorithms. We put columns to be joined in sorted arrays and we usepermutation arrays to encode positions of tuples in one sorted array wrt the other sortedarray. In contrast to sort-merge join; we use space efficient bit-arrays that enableoptimizations; such as Bloom filter indices; for fast computation of the join results. We haveimplemented a centralized version of these algorithms on top of PostgreSQL; and a …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,15
DASPfind: new efficient method to predict drug–target interactions,Wail Ba-Alawi; Othman Soufan; Magbubah Essack; Panos Kalnis; Vladimir B Bajic,Abstract Background Identification of novel drug–target interactions (DTIs) is important fordrug discovery. Experimental determination of such DTIs is costly and time consuming;hence it necessitates the development of efficient computational methods for the accurateprediction of potential DTIs. To-date; many computational methods have been proposed forthis purpose; but they suffer the drawback of a high rate of false positive predictions. ResultsHere; we developed a novel computational DTI prediction method; DASPfind. DASPfinduses simple paths of particular lengths inferred from a graph that describes DTIs; similaritiesbetween drugs; and similarities between the protein targets of drugs. We show that onaverage; over the four gold standard DTI datasets; DASPfind significantly outperforms otherexisting methods when the single top-ranked predictions are considered; resulting in …,Journal of cheminformatics,2016,14
Evaluating SPARQL queries on massive RDF datasets,Razen Harbi; Ibrahim Abdelaziz; Panos Kalnis; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract Distributed RDF systems partition data across multiple computer nodes. Partitioningis typically based on heuristics that minimize inter-node communication and it is performedin an initial; data pre-processing phase. Therefore; the resulting partitions are static and donot adapt to changes in the query workload; as a result; existing systems are unable toconsistently avoid communication for queries that are not favored by the initial datapartitioning. Furthermore; for very large RDF knowledge bases; the partitioning phasebecomes prohibitively expensive; leading to high startup costs. In this paper; we proposeAdHash; a distributed RDF system which addresses the shortcomings of previous work.First; AdHash initially applies lightweight hash partitioning; which drastically minimizes thestartup cost; while favoring the parallel processing of join patterns on subjects; without …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,13
Tracking moving objects in anonymized trajectories,Nikolay Vyahhi; Spiridon Bakiras; Panos Kalnis; Gabriel Ghinita,Abstract Multiple target tracking (MTT) is a well-studied technique in the field of radartechnology; which associates anonymized measurements with the appropriate objecttrajectories. This technique; however; suffers from combinatorial explosion; since each newmeasurement may potentially be associated with any of the existing tracks. Consequently;the complexity of existing MTT algorithms grows exponentially with the number of objects;rendering them inapplicable to large databases. In this paper; we investigate the feasibilityof applying the MTT framework in the context of large trajectory databases. Given a history ofobject movements; where the corresponding object ids have been removed; our goal is totrack the trajectory of every object in the database in successive timestamps. Our maincontribution lies in the transition from an exponential solution to a polynomial one. We …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2008,12
Evaluation of top-k OLAP queries using aggregate r–trees,Nikos Mamoulis; Spiridon Bakiras; Panos Kalnis,Abstract A top-k OLAP query groups measures with respect to some abstraction level ofinteresting dimensions and selects the k groups with the highest aggregate value. Anexample of such a query is “find the 10 combinations of product-type and month with thelargest sum of sales”. Such queries may also be applied in a spatial database context;where objects are augmented with some measures that must be aggregated according to aspatial division. For instance; consider a map of objects (eg; restaurants); where each objectcarries some non-spatial measure (eg; the number of customers served during the lastmonth). Given a partitioning of the space into regions (eg; by a regular grid); the goal is tofind the regions with the highest number of served customers. A straightforward method toevaluate a top-k OLAP query is to compute the aggregate value for each group and then …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2005,12
ACME: A scalable parallel system for extracting frequent patterns from a very long sequence,Majed Sahli; Essam Mansour; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Modern applications; including bioinformatics; time series; and web log analysis;require the extraction of frequent patterns; called motifs; from one very long (ie; severalgigabytes) sequence. Existing approaches are either heuristics that are error-prone; or exact(also called combinatorial) methods that are extremely slow; therefore; applicable only tovery small sequences (ie; in the order of megabytes). This paper presents ACME; acombinatorial approach that scales to gigabyte-long sequences and is the first to supportsupermaximal motifs. ACME is a versatile parallel system that can be deployed on desktopmulti-core systems; or on thousands of CPUs in the cloud. However; merely using morecompute nodes does not guarantee efficiency; because of the related overheads. To thisend; ACME introduces an automatic tuning mechanism that suggests the appropriate …,The VLDB Journal,2014,11
Processing ad-hoc joins on mobile devices,Eric Lo; Nikos Mamoulis; David W Cheung; Wai Shing Ho; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Mobile devices are capable of retrieving and processing data from remotedatabases. In a wireless data transmission environment; users are typically charged by thesize of transferred data; rather than the amount of time they stay connected. We proposealgorithms that join information from non-collaborative remote databases on mobile devices.Our methods minimize the data transferred during the join process; by also considering thelimitations of mobile devices. Experimental results show that our approach can perform joinprocessing on mobile devices effectively.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2004,11
Parallel motif extraction from very long sequences,Majed Sahli; Essam Mansour; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Motifs are frequent patterns used to identify biological functionality in genomicsequences; periodicity in time series; or user trends in web logs. In contrast to a lot ofexisting work that focuses on collections of many short sequences; modern applicationsrequire mining of motifs in one very long sequence (ie; in the order of several gigabytes). Forthis case; there exist statistical approaches that are fast but inaccurate; or combinatorialmethods that are sound and complete. Unfortunately; existing combinatorial methods areserial and very slow. Consequently; they are limited to very short sequences (ie; a fewmegabytes); small alphabets (typically 4 symbols for DNA sequences); and restricted typesof motifs. This paper presents ACME; a combinatorial method for extracting motifs from asingle very long sequence. ACME arranges the search space in contiguous blocks that …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,10
Distributed privacy preserving data collection,Mingqiang Xue; Panagiotis Papadimitriou; Chedy Raïssi; Panos Kalnis; Hung Keng Pung,Abstract We study the distributed privacy preserving data collection problem: an untrusteddata collector (eg; a medical research institute) wishes to collect data (eg; medical records)from a group of respondents (eg; patients). Each respondent owns a multi-attributed recordwhich contains both non-sensitive (eg; quasi-identifiers) and sensitive information (eg; aparticular disease); and submits it to the data collector. Assuming T is the table formed by allthe respondent data records; we say that the data collection process is privacy preserving ifit allows the data collector to obtain ak-anonymized or l-diversified version of T withoutrevealing the original records to the adversary. We propose a distributed data collectionprotocol that outputs an anonymized table by generalization of quasi-identifier attributes.The protocol employs cryptographic techniques such as homomorphic encryption; private …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2011,10
Spatial anonymity,Panos Kalnis; Gabriel Ghinita,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,*,2009,10
Mining chemical activity status from high-throughput screening assays,Othman Soufan; Wail Ba-Alawi; Moataz Afeef; Magbubah Essack; Valentin Rodionov; Panos Kalnis; Vladimir B Bajic,High-throughput screening (HTS) experiments provide a valuable resource that reportsbiological activity of numerous chemical compounds relative to their molecular targets.Building computational models that accurately predict such activity status (active vs. inactive)in specific assays is a challenging task given the large volume of data and frequently smallproportion of active compounds relative to the inactive ones. We developed a method;DRAMOTE; to predict activity status of chemical compounds in HTP activity assays. For aclass of HTP assays; our method achieves considerably better results than the current state-of-the-art-solutions. We achieved this by modification of a minority oversampling technique.To demonstrate that DRAMOTE is performing better than the other methods; we performed acomprehensive comparison analysis with several other methods and evaluated them on …,PloS one,2015,9
Optimization algorithms for simultaneous multidimensional queries in OLAP environments,Panos Kalnis; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract Multi-Dimensional Expressions (MDX) provide an interface for asking severalrelated OLAP queries simultaneously. An interesting problem is how to optimize theexecution of an MDX query; given that most data warehouses maintain a set of redundantmaterialized views to accelerate OLAP operations. A number of greedy and approximationalgorithms have been proposed for different versions of the problem. In this paper weevaluate experimentally their performance using the APB and TPC-H benchmarks;concluding that they do not scale well for realistic workloads. Motivated by this fact; wedeveloped two novel greedy algorithms. Our algorithms construct the execution plan in a top-down manner by identifying in each step the most beneficial view; instead of finding the mostpromising query. We show by extensive experimentation that our methods outperform the …,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2001,9
Searching trajectories by regions of interest,Shuo Shang; Lisi Chen; Christian S Jensen; Ji-Rong Wen; Panos Kalnis,With the increasing availability of moving-object tracking data; trajectory search isincreasingly important. We propose and investigate a novel query type named trajectorysearch by regions of interest (TSR query). Given an argument set of trajectories; a TSRquery takes a set of regions of interest as a parameter and returns the trajectory in theargument set with the highest spatial-density correlation to the query regions. This type ofquery is useful in many popular applications such as trip planning and recommendation;and location based services in general. TSR query processing faces three challenges: howto model the spatial-density correlation between query regions and data trajectories; how toeffectively prune the search space; and how to effectively schedule multiple so-called querysources. To tackle these challenges; a series of new metrics are defined to model spatial …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,8
Automatic tuning of bag-of-tasks applications,Majed Sahli; Essam Mansour; Tariq Alturkestani; Panos Kalnis,This paper presents APlug; a framework for automatic tuning of large scale applications ofmany independent tasks. APlug suggests the best decomposition of the original computationinto smaller tasks and the best number of CPUs to use; in order to meet user-specificconstraints. We show that the problem is not trivial because there is large variability in theexecution time of tasks; and it is possible for a task to occupy a CPU by performing uselesscomputations. APlug collects a sample of task execution times and builds a model; which isthen used by a discrete event simulator to calculate the optimal parameters. We provide aC++ API and a stand-alone implementation of APlug; and we integrate it with three typicalapplications from computational chemistry; bioinformatics; and data mining. A scenario foroptimizing resources utilization is used to demonstrate our framework. We run …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,8
SPARTex: a vertex-centric framework for RDF data analytics,Ibrahim Abdelaziz; Razen Harbi; Semih Salihoglu; Panos Kalnis; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract A growing number of applications require combining SPARQL queries with genericgraph search on RDF data. However; the lack of procedural capabilities in SPARQL makes itinappropriate for graph analytics. Moreover; RDF engines focus on SPARQL queryevaluation whereas graph management frameworks perform only generic graphcomputations. In this work; we bridge the gap by introducing SPARTex; an RDF analyticsframework based on the vertex-centric computation model. In SPARTex; user-defined vertexcentric programs can be invoked from SPARQL as stored procedures. SPARTex allows theexecution of a pipeline of graph algorithms without the need for multiple reads/writes of inputdata and intermediate results. We use a cost-based optimizer for minimizing thecommunication cost. SPARTex evaluates queries that combine SPARQL and generic …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,6
Localized signature table: Fast similarity search on transaction data,Qiang Jing; Rui Yang; Panos Kalnis; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Recently; techniques for supporting efficient similarity search over huge transactiondatasets have emerged as an important research area. Several indexing schemes havebeen proposed towards this direction. Typically; these schemes provide a tradeoff betweensearching efficiency and indexing overhead in terms of space. In this paper; we propose anovel indexing scheme for similarity search on transaction data. Based on well-studiedclustering techniques; we develop a construction algorithm for the proposed index and abranch-and-bound searching strategy for answering similarity search. Unlike previoustechniques; our indexing scheme exhibits high search efficiency and low spacerequirements by trading-off the pre-computation time. This behavior is ideal for applicationswith low update but high read volume< i> eg</i>; data warehousing; collaborative filtering …,Proceedings of the thirteenth ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2004,6
Combining Vertex-centric Graph Processing with SPARQL for Large-scale RDF Data Analytics,Ibrahim Abdelaziz; Razen Harbi; Semih Salihoglu; Panos Kalnis,Modern applications require sophisticated analytics on RDF graphs that combine structuralqueries with generic graph computations. Existing systems support either declarativeSPARQL queries; or generic graph processing; but not both. We bridge the gap byintroducing Spartex; a versatile framework for complex RDF analytics. Spartex extendsSPARQL to combine seamlessly generic graph algorithms (eg; PageRank; Shortest Paths;etc.) with SPARQL queries. Spartex builds on existing vertex-centric graph processingframeworks; such as Graphlab or Pregel. It implements a generic SPARQL operator as avertex-centric program that interprets SPARQL queries and executes them efficiently using abuilt-in optimizer. In addition; any graph algorithm implemented in the underlying vertex-centric framework; can be executed in Spartex.

Scalemine: scalable parallel frequent subgraph mining in a single large graph,Ehab Abdelhamid; Ibrahim Abdelaziz; Panos Kalnis; Zuhair Khayyat; Fuad Jamour,Abstract Frequent Subgraph Mining is an essential operation for graph analytics andknowledge extraction. Due to its high computational cost; parallel solutions are necessary.Existing approaches either suffer from load imbalance; or high communication andsynchronization overheads. In this paper we propose ScaleMine; a novel parallel frequentsubgraph mining system for a single large graph. ScaleMine introduces a novel two-phaseapproach.

A general framework for searching in distributed data repositories,Spiridon Bakiras; Panos Kalnis; Thanasis Loukopoulos; Wee Siong Ng,This paper proposes a general framework for searching large distributed repositories.Examples of such repositories include sites with music/video content; distributed digitallibraries; distributed caching systems; etc. The framework is based on the concept ofneighborhood; each client keeps a list of the most beneficial sites according to pastexperience; which are visited first when the client searches for some particular content.Exploration methods continuously update the neighborhoods in order to follow changes inaccess patterns. Depending on the application; several variations of search and explorationprocesses are proposed. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the benefits of theframework in different scenarios.,Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium; 2003. Proceedings. International,2003,5
Static and dynamic view selection in distributed data warehouse systems,Panagiotis Kalnis,Abstract View materialization is commonly used to accelerate On-Line Analytical Processing(OLAP) operations. Views may be materialized at any of the three layers of a decisionsupport system:(i) at the server side (ie the data warehouse);(ii) at a mid-tier; between theserver and the client and;(iii) at the client side. Typically; static view selection is used at theserver side; while dynamic approaches are employed for the other two cases. This thesisprovides novel insights on view materialization techniques at all three layers: For the server-side layer; we propose the application of randomized local search algorithms; which providenear-optimal solutions in limited time for the view selection problem. In contrast to existingsystematic techniques; randomized algorithms are applicable to high-dimensional datawarehouses.,*,2002,5
StarDB: a large-scale DBMS for strings,Majed Sahli; Essam Mansour; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Strings and applications using them are proliferating in science and business.Currently; strings are stored in file systems and processed using ad-hoc procedural code.Existing techniques are not flexible and cannot efficiently handle complex queries or largedatasets. In this paper; we demonstrate StarDB; a distributed database system for analyticson strings. StarDB hides data and system complexities and allows users to focus onanalytics. It uses a comprehensive set of parallel string operations and provides adeclarative query language to solve complex queries. StarDB automatically tunes itself andruns with over 90% efficiency on supercomputers; public clouds; clusters; and workstations.We test StarDB using real datasets that are 2 orders of magnitude larger than the datasetsreported by previous works.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,4
Hi-Jack: a novel computational framework for pathway-based inference of host–pathogen interactions,Dimitrios Kleftogiannis; Limsoon Wong; John AC Archer; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Motivation: Pathogens infect their host and hijack the host machinery to producemore progeny pathogens. Obligate intracellular pathogens; in particular; require resourcesof the host to replicate. Therefore; infections by these pathogens lead to alterations in themetabolism of the host; shifting in favor of pathogen protein production. Some computationalidentification of mechanisms of host–pathogen interactions have been proposed; but itseems the problem has yet to be approached from the metabolite-hijacking angle. Results:We propose a novel computational framework; Hi-Jack; for inferring pathway-basedinteractions between a host and a pathogen that relies on the idea of metabolite hijacking.Hi-Jack searches metabolic network data from hosts and pathogens; and identifiescandidate reactions where hijacking occurs.

Ad-hoc distributed spatial joins on mobile devices,Panos Kalnis; Nikos Mamoulis; Spiridon Bakiras; Xiaochen Li,PDAs; cellular phones and other mobile devices are now capable of supporting complexdata manipulation operations. Here; we focus on ad-hoc spatial joins of datasets residing inmultiple non-cooperative servers. Assuming that there is no mediator available; the spatialjoins must be evaluated on the mobile device. Contrary to common applications thatconsider the cost at the server side; our main issue is the minimization of the transferreddata; while meeting the resource constraints of the device. We show that existing methods;based on partitioning and pruning; are inadequate in many realistic situations. Then; wepresent novel algorithms that estimate the data distribution before deciding the physicaloperator independently for each partition. Our experiments with a prototype implementationon a WiFi-enabled PDA; suggest that the proposed methods outperform the competitors …,Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium; 2006.

Fast and scalable inequality joins,Zuhair Khayyat; William Lucia; Meghna Singh; Mourad Ouzzani; Paolo Papotti; Jorge-Arnulfo Quiané-Ruiz; Nan Tang; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Inequality joins; which is to join relations with inequality conditions; are used invarious applications. Optimizing joins has been the subject of intensive research rangingfrom efficient join algorithms such as sort-merge join; to the use of efficient indices such asB^+ B+-tree; R^* R∗-tree and Bitmap. However; inequality joins have received little attentionand queries containing such joins are notably very slow. In this paper; we introduce fastinequality join algorithms based on sorted arrays and space-efficient bit-arrays. We furtherintroduce a simple method to estimate the selectivity of inequality joins which is then used tooptimize multiple predicate queries and multi-way joins. Moreover; we study an incrementalinequality join algorithm to handle scenarios where data keeps changing.

To 4;000 compute nodes and beyond: network-aware vertex placement in large-scale graph processing systems,Karim Awara; Hani Jamjoom; Panos Kanlis,Abstract The explosive growth of" big data" is giving rise to a new breed of large scale graphsystems; such as Pregel. This poster describes our ongoing work in characterizing andminimizing the communication cost of Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) graph miningsystems; like Pregel; when scaling to 4;096 compute nodes. Existing implementationsgenerally assume a fixed communication cost. This is sufficient in small deployments as theBSP programming model (ie; overlapping computation and communication) masks smallvariations in the underlying network. In large scale deployments; such variations candominate the overall runtime characteristics. In this poster; we first quantify the impact ofnetwork communication on the total compute time of a Pregel system. We then propose anefficient vertex placement strategy that subsamples highly connected vertices and applies …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2013,3

This raises a fundamental question: what kinds of computationshould be delegated to the network? In this paper; we discuss the opportunities andchallenges for co-designing data center distributed systems with their network layer. Webelieve that the time has finally come for offloading part of their computation to execute in-network. However; in-network computation tasks must be judiciously crafted to match thelimitations of the network machine architecture of programmable devices.

Trajectory similarity join in spatial networks,Shuo Shang; Lisi Chen; Zhewei Wei; Christian S Jensen; Kai Zheng; Panos Kalnis,Abstract The matching of similar pairs of objects; called similarity join; is fundamentalfunctionality in data management. We consider the case of trajectory similarity join (TS-Join);where the objects are trajectories of vehicles moving in road networks. Thus; given two setsof trajectories and a threshold θ; the TS-Join returns all pairs of trajectories from the two setswith similarity above θ. This join targets applications such as trajectory near-duplicatedetection; data cleaning; ridesharing recommendation; and traffic congestion prediction.With these applications in mind; we provide a purposeful definition of similarity. To enableefficient TS-Join processing on large sets of trajectories; we develop search space pruningtechniques and take into account the parallel processing capabilities of modern processors.Specifically; we present a two-phase divide-and-conquer algorithm.

A benchmark for betweenness centrality approximation algorithms on large graphs,Ziyad AlGhamdi; Fuad Jamour; Spiros Skiadopoulos; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Betweenness centrality quantifies the importance of graph nodes in a variety ofapplications including social; biological and communication networks. Its computation isvery costly for large graphs; therefore; many approximate methods have been proposed.Given the lack of a golden standard; the accuracy of most approximate methods is evaluatedon tiny graphs and is not guaranteed to be representative of realistic datasets that are ordersof magnitude larger. In this paper; we develop BeBeCA; a benchmark for betweennesscentrality approximation methods on large graphs. Specifically:(i) We generate a goldenstandard by deploying a parallel implementation of Brandes algorithm using 96;000 CPUcores on a supercomputer to compute exact betweenness centrality values for several largegraphs with up to 126M edges.(ii) We propose an evaluation methodology to assess …,Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2017,2
PhD-Store: An adaptive SPARQL engine with dynamic partitioning for distributed RDF repositories,Razen Al-Harbi; Yasser Ebrahim; Panos Kalnis,Abstract: Many repositories utilize the versatile RDF model to publish data. Repositories aretypically distributed and geographically remote; but data are interconnected (eg; theSemantic Web) and queried globally by a language such as SPARQL. Due to the networkcost and the nature of the queries; the execution time can be prohibitively high. Currentsolutions attempt to minimize the network cost by redistributing all data in a preprocessingphase; but here are two drawbacks:(i) redistribution is based on heuristics that may notbenefit many of the future queries; and (ii) the preprocessing phase is very expensive evenfor moderate size datasets. In this paper we propose PHD-Store; a SPARQL engine fordistributed RDF repositories. Our system does not assume any particular initial dataplacement and does not require prepartitioning; hence; it minimizes the startup cost …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1405.4979,2014,2
Distributed Spatial Databases,Panos Kalnis,realized using such logical structures. For example; in tree based data acquisition protocols;a collection tree is built that is rooted at the data collection center such as the sink node [8].The dissemination of the data requests from the participating nodes and collection of datafrom the sensor nodes are accomplished using this tree. A cluster based data acquisitionmechanism has been proposed in [3]. As shown in Fig. 1; nodes are organized into a fixednumber of clusters; and nodes within each cluster dynamically elect a cluster head. The dataacquisition is carried out in two phases. In the first phase; cluster heads collect data fromtheir cluster nodes. In the second phase; cluster heads send collected data to the nodes thathave subscribed to the data. The cluster heads are re-elected to balance energyconsumption among the nodes in the cluster. Zhang et al.[13] have proposed an adaptive …,*,2009,2
DAIET: a system for data aggregation inside the network,Amedeo Sapio; Ibrahim Abdelaziz; Marco Canini; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Many data center applications nowadays rely on distributed computation modelslike MapReduce and Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) for data-intensive computation atscale [4]. These models scale by leveraging the partition/aggregate pattern where data andcomputations are distributed across many worker servers; each performing part of thecomputation. A communication phase is needed each time workers need to synchronize thecomputation and; at last; to produce the final output. In these applications; the networkcommunication costs can be one of the dominant scalability bottlenecks especially in case ofmulti-stage or iterative computations [1].,Proceedings of the 2017 Symposium on Cloud Computing,2017,1
A survey and experimental comparison of distributed SPARQL engines for very large RDF data,Ibrahim Abdelaziz; Razen Harbi; Zuhair Khayyat; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Distributed SPARQL engines promise to support very large RDF datasets byutilizing shared-nothing computer clusters. Some are based on distributed frameworks suchas MapReduce; others implement proprietary distributed processing; and some rely onexpensive preprocessing for data partitioning. These systems exhibit a variety of trade-offsthat are not well-understood; due to the lack of any comprehensive quantitative andqualitative evaluation.

Several approaches have been proposed to optimize query processing over asmall number of heterogeneous data sources by utilizing schema information.

DRABAL: novel method to mine large high-throughput screening assays using Bayesian active learning,Othman Soufan; Wail Ba-Alawi; Moataz Afeef; Magbubah Essack; Panos Kalnis; Vladimir B Bajic,Mining high-throughput screening (HTS) assays is key for enhancing decisions in the areaof drug repositioning and drug discovery. However; many challenges are encountered in theprocess of developing suitable and accurate methods for extracting useful information fromthese assays. Virtual screening and a wide variety of databases; methods and solutionsproposed to-date; did not completely overcome these challenges.

RACE: a scalable and elastic parallel system for discovering repeats in very long sequences,Essam Mansour; Ahmed El-Roby; Panos Kalnis; Aron Ahmadia; Ashraf Aboulnaga,Abstract A wide range of applications; including bioinformatics; time series; and log analysis;depend on the identification of repetitions in very long sequences. The problem of findingmaximal pairs subsumes most important types of repetition-finding tasks. Existing solutionsrequire both the input sequence and its index (typically an order of magnitude larger thanthe input) to fit in memory. Moreover; they are serial algorithms with long execution time.Therefore; they are limited to small datasets; despite the fact that modern applicationsdemand orders of magnitude longer sequences. In this paper we present RACE; a parallelsystem for finding maximal pairs in very long sequences.

Each respondent owns a multi-attributed record which containsboth non-sensitive (eg; quasi-identifiers) and sensitive information (eg; a particular disease);and submits it to the data collector. Assuming $ T $ is the table formed by all the respondentdata records; we say that the data collection process is $ k $-anonymous if it allows the datacollector to obtain a $ k $-anonymized version of $ T $ without revealing the original recordsto any adversary. In contrast to most $ k $-anonymization approaches which trust the datacollector; our work assumes that the adversary can be any third party; including the datacollector and the other responders.

Efficient processing of distributed iceberg semi-joins,Mohammed Kasim Imthiyaz; Dong Xiaoan; Panos Kalnis,Abstract The Iceberg SemiJoin (ISJ) of two datasets \mathcalR and \mathcalS returns thetuples in \mathcalR which join with at least k tuples of \mathcalS. The ISJ operator isessential in many practical applications including OLAP; Data Mining and InformationRetrieval. In this paper we consider the distributed evaluation of Iceberg SemiJoins; where\mathcalR and \mathcalS reside on remote servers. We developed an efficient algorithmwhich employs Bloom filters. The novelty of our approach is that we interleave the evaluationof the Iceberg set in server \mathcalS with the pruning of unmatched tuples in server\mathcalR. Therefore; we are able to (i) eliminate unnecessary tuples early; and (ii) extractaccurate Bloom filters from the intermediate hash tables which are constructed during thegeneration of the Iceberg set.

Thus; the computation ofbetweenness centrality should be performed incrementally. This is challenging becauseupdating even a single edge may trigger the computation of all-pairs shortest paths in theentire graph.

Distributed Privacy Preserving Data Collection using Cryptographic Techniques,Mingqiang Xue; Panagiotis Papadimitriou; Chedy Raıssi; Panos Kalnis; Hung Keng Pung,Abstract—We study the distributed k-anonymous data collection problem: a data collector(eg; a medical research institute) wishes to collect data (eg; medical records) from a group ofrespondents (eg; patients). Each respondent owns a multiattributed record which containsboth non-sensitive (eg; quasiidentifiers) and sensitive information (eg; a particular disease);and submits it to the data collector. Assuming T is the table formed by all the respondentdata records; we say that the data collection process is k-anonymous if it allows the datacollector to obtain a k-anonymized version of T without revealing the original records to anyadversary. In contrast to most k-anonymization approaches which trust the data collector; ourwork assumes that the adversary can be any third party; including the data collector and theother responders. We propose a distributed data collection protocol that outputs a k …,*,*,*
POEMS: A Transformable Architecture for Managing System Overload,Wee Siong Ng; Panos Kalnis; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,ABSTRACT In a typical organizational scenario; hundreds of personal computers (PCs) areused mainly for simple office tasks. Typically; a central database management system(DBMS) receives requests internally or externally through an Internet connection that servesas a backend of Web services. The unpredictability and fluctuations of requests could resultin the overload of the DBMS. Existing load management systems assume nodes are fullydedicated to sharing loads; which could cause interruptions of the existing tasks running onthe office PCs. In addition; data are statically partitioned and cached in the nodespermanently even though the system may be under-loaded. Moreover; the nodes that areinvolved in load-balancing are not allowed to dismiss the processes. In this paper; wedescribe a novel framework; POEMS; that is transformable between a client-server and …,*,*,*
