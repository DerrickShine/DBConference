Hardware-oblivious parallelism for in-memory column-stores,Max Heimel; Michael Saecker; Holger Pirk; Stefan Manegold; Volker Markl,Abstract The multi-core architectures of today's computer systems make parallelism anecessity for performance critical applications. Writing such applications in a generic;hardware-oblivious manner is a challenging problem: Current database systems thus relyon labor-intensive and error-prone manual tuning to exploit the full potential of modernparallel hardware architectures like multi-core CPUs and graphics cards. We propose analternative design for a parallel database engine; based on a single set of hardware-oblivious operators; which are compiled down to the actual hardware at runtime. This designreduces the development overhead for parallel database engines; while achievingcompetitive performance to hand-tuned systems. We provide a proof-of-concept for thisdesign by integrating operators written using the parallel programming framework …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,85
Accelerating Foreign-Key Joins using Asymmetric Memory Channels.,Holger Pirk; Stefan Manegold; Martin L Kersten,ABSTRACT Indexed Foreign-Key Joins expose a very asymmetric access pattern: theForeign-Key Index is sequentially scanned whilst the Primary-Key table is target of manyquasi-random lookups which is the dominant cost factor. To reduce the costs of the randomlookups the fact-table can be (re-) partitioned at runtime to increase access locality on thedimension table; and thus limit the random memory access to inside the CPU's cache.However; this is very hard to optimize and the performance impact on recent architectures islimited because the partitioning costs consume most of the achievable join improvement [3].GPGPUs on the other hand have an architecture that is well suited for this operation: arelatively slow connection to the large system memory and a very fast connection to thesmaller internal device memory. We show how to accelerate Foreign-Key Joins by …,ADMS@ VLDB,2011,42
CPU and Cache Efficient Management of Memory-Resident Databases,Holger Pirk; Florian Funke; Martin Grund; Thomas Neumann; Ulf Leser; Stefan Manegold; Alfons Kemper; Martin Kersten,Memory-Resident Database Management Systems (MRDBMS) have to be optimized for tworesources: CPU cycles and memory bandwidth. To optimize for bandwidth in mixedOLTP/OLAP scenarios; the hybrid or Partially Decomposed Storage Model (PDSM) hasbeen proposed. However; in current implementations; bandwidth savings achieved bypartial decomposition come at increased CPU costs. To achieve the aspired bandwidthsavings without sacrificing CPU efficiency; we combine partially decomposed storage withJust-in-Time (JiT) compilation of queries; thus eliminating CPU inefficient function calls.Since existing cost based optimization components are not designed for JiT-compiled queryexecution; we also develop a novel approach to cost modeling and subsequent storagelayout optimization. Our evaluation shows that the JiT-based processor maintains the …,ICDE,2013,30
Waste not… Efficient co-processing of relational data,Holger Pirk; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten,The variety of memory devices in modern computer systems holds opportunities as well aschallenges for data management systems. In particular; the exploitation of GraphicsProcessing Units (GPUs) and their fast memory has been studied quite intensively.However; current approaches treat GPUs as systems in their own right and fail to provide ageneric strategy for efficient CPU/GPU cooperation. We propose such a strategy forrelational query processing: calculating an approximate result based on lossily compressed;GPU-resident data and refine the result using residuals; ie; the lost data; on the CPU. Wedeveloped the required algorithms; implemented the strategy in an existing DBMS andfound up to 8 times performance improvement; even for datasets larger than the availableGPU memory.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,27
Database cracking: fancy scan; not poor man's sort!,Holger Pirk; Eleni Petraki; Stratos Idreos; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten,Abstract Database Cracking is an appealing approach to adaptive indexing: on every range-selection query; the data is partitioned using the supplied predicates as pivots. The core ofdatabase cracking is; thus; pivoted partitioning. While pivoted partitioning; like scanning;requires a single pass through the data it tends to have much higher costs due to lower CPUefficiency. In this paper; we conduct an in-depth study of the reasons for the low CPUefficiency of pivoted partitioning. Based on the findings; we develop an optimized versionwith significantly higher (single-threaded) CPU efficiency. We also develop a number ofmulti-threaded implementations that are effectively bound by memory bandwidth. Combiningall of these optimizations we achieve an implementation that has costs close to or better thanan ordinary scan on a variety of systems ranging from low-end (cheaper than $300) …,Proceedings of the Tenth International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2014,25
Weld: A common runtime for high performance data analytics,Shoumik Palkar; James J Thomas; Anil Shanbhag; Deepak Narayanan; Holger Pirk; Malte Schwarzkopf; Saman Amarasinghe; Matei Zaharia; Stanford InfoLab,Abstract Modern analytics applications combine multiple functions from different librariesand frameworks to build increasingly complex workflows. Even though each function mayachieve high performance in isolation; the performance of the combined workflow is often anorder of magnitude below hardware limits due to extensive data movement across thefunctions. To address this problem; we propose Weld; a runtime for data-intensiveapplications that optimizes across disjoint libraries and functions. Weld uses a commonintermediate representation to capture the structure of diverse dataparallel workloads;including SQL; machine learning and graph analytics. It then performs key data movementoptimizations and generates efficient parallel code for the whole workflow.

X-device query processing by bitwise distribution,Holger Pirk; Thibault Sellam; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten,Abstract The diversity of hardware components within a single system calls for strategies forefficient cross-device data processing. For example; existing approaches to CPU/GPU co-processing distribute individual relational operators to the" most appropriate" device. Whilepleasantly simple; this strategy has a number of problems: it may leave the" inappropriate"devices idle while overloading the" appropriate" device and putting a high pressure on thePCI bus. To address these issues we distribute data among the devices by partiallydecomposing relations at the granularity of individual bits. Each of the resulting bit-partitionsis stored and processed on one of the available devices. Using this strategy; weimplemented a processor for spatial range queries that makes efficient use of all availabledevices. The performance gains achieved indicate that bitwise distribution makes a good …,Proceedings of the Eighth International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2012,13
Efficient cross-device query processing,Holger Pirk,ABSTRACT The increasing diversity of hardware within a single system promises largeperformance gains but also poses a challenge for data management systems. Strategies forthe efficient use of hardware with large performance differences are still lacking. Forexample; existing research on GPU supported data management largely handles the GPUin isolation from the system's CPU—The GPU is considered the central processor and theCPU used only to mitigate the GPU's weaknesses where necessary. To make efficient use ofall available devices; we developed a processing strategy that lets unequal devices likeGPU and CPU combine their strengths rather than work in isolation. To this end; wedecompose relational data into individual bits and place the resulting partitions on theappropriate devices. Operations are processed in phases; each phase executed on one …,The VLDB PhD Workshop. VLDB Endowment,2012,13
Voodoo-a vector algebra for portable database performance on modern hardware,Holger Pirk; Oscar Moll; Matei Zaharia; Sam Madden,Abstract In-memory databases require careful tuning and many engineering tricks to achievegood performance. Such database performance engineering is hard: a plethora of data andhardware-dependent optimization techniques form a design space that is difficult to navigatefor a skilled engineer---even more so for a query compiler. To facilitate performance-orienteddesign exploration and query plan compilation; we present Voodoo; a declarativeintermediate algebra that abstracts the detailed architectural properties of the hardware;such as multi-or many-core architectures; caches and SIMD registers; without losing theability to generate highly tuned code. Because it consists of a collection of declarative; vector-oriented operations; Voodoo is easier to reason about and tune than low-level C and relatedhardware-focused extensions (Intrinsics; OpenCL; CUDA; etc.).

Instant-On Scientific Data Warehouses,Yağız Kargın; Holger Pirk; Milena Ivanova; Stefan Manegold; Martin Kersten,Abstract In the dawn of the data intensive research era; scientific discovery deploys dataanalysis techniques similar to those that drive business intelligence. Similar to classicalExtract; Transform and Load (ETL) processes; data is loaded entirely from external datasources (repositories) into a scientific data warehouse before it can be analyzed. Thisprocess is both; time and resource intensive and may not be entirely necessary if only asubset of the data is of interest to a particular user. To overcome this problem; we propose anovel technique to lower the costs for data loading: Lazy ETL. Data is extracted and loadedtransparently on-the-fly only for the required data items.

Scalable Generation of Synthetic GPS Traces with Real-life Data Characteristics,Konrad Bösche; Thibault Sellam; Holger Pirk; René Beier; Peter Mieth; Stefan Manegold,Abstract Database benchmarking is most valuable if real-life data and workloads areavailable. However; real-life data (and workloads) are often not publicly available due to IPRconstraints or privacy concerns. And even if available; they are often limited regardingscalability and variability of data characteristics. On the other hand; while easily scalable;synthetically generated data often fail to adequately reflect real-life data characteristics.While there are well established synthetic benchmarks and data generators for; eg; businessdata (TPC-C; TPC-H); there is no such up-to-date data generator; let alone benchmark; forspatiotemporal and/or moving objects data. In this work; we present a data generator forspatiotemporal data. More specifically; our data generator produces synthetic GPS traces;mimicking the GPS traces that GPS navigation devices generate.

As aresult; Earth Observation (EO) data has been constantly increasing in volume in the last fewyears; and is currently reaching petabytes in many satellite archives. For example; the multi-mission data archive of the TELEIOS partner German Aerospace Center (DLR) is expectedto reach 2PB next year; while ESA estimates that it will be archiving 20PB of data before theyear 2020. As the volume of data in satellite archives has been increasing; so have thescientific and commercial applications of EO data. Nevertheless; it is estimated that up to95% of the data present in existing archives has never been accessed; so the potential forincreasing exploitation is very big.,International conference on web reasoning and rule systems,2012,7

Cache conscious data layouting for in-memory databases,Holger Pirk; M Grund; J Krueger; U Leser; A Zeier,Abstract Many applications with manually implemented data management exhibit a datastorage pattern in which semantically related data items are stored closer in memory thanunrelated data items. The strong sematic relationship between these data items commonlyinduces contemporary accesses to them. This is called the principle of data locality and hasbeen recognized by hardware vendors. It is commonly exploited to improve the performanceof hardware. General Purpose Database Management Systems (DBMSs); whose main goalis to simplify optimal data storage and processing; generally fall short of this claim becausethe usage pattern of the stored data cannot be anticipated when designing the system. Thecurrent interest in column oriented databases indicates that one strategy does not fit allapplications.

The DBMS-your big data sommelier,Yağız Kargın; Martin Kersten; Stefan Manegold; Holger Pirk,When addressing the problem of “big” data volume; preparation costs are one of the keychallenges: the high costs for loading; aggregating and indexing data leads to a long data-to-insight time. In addition to being a nuisance to the end-user; this latency prevents real-timeanalytics on “big” data. Fortunately; data often comes in semantic chunks such as files thatcontain data items that share some characteristics such as acquisition time or location. Adata management system that exploits this trait can significantly lower the data preparationcosts and the associated data-to-insight time by only investing in the preparation of therelevant chunks. In this paper; we develop such a system as an extension of an existingrelational DBMS (MonetDB). To this end; we develop a query processing paradigm and datastorage model that are partial-loading aware. The result is a system that can make a 1.2 …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,5

Non-invasive progressive optimization for in-memory databases,Steffen Zeuch; Holger Pirk; Johann-Christoph Freytag,Abstract Progressive optimization introduces robustness for database workloads againstwrong estimates; skewed data; correlated attributes; or outdated statistics. Previous workfocuses on cardinality estimates and rely on expensive counting methods as well ascomplex learning algorithms. In this paper; we utilize performance counters to driveprogressive optimization during query execution. The main advantages are thatperformance counters introduce virtually no costs on modern CPUs and their usage enablesa non-invasive monitoring. We present fine-grained cost models to detect differencesbetween estimates and actual costs which enables us to kick-start reoptimization. Based onour cost models; we implement an optimization approach that estimates the individualselectivities of a multi-selection query efficiently.

Locality-Adaptive Parallel Hash Joins using Hardware Transactional Memory,Anil Shanbhag; Holger Pirk; Sam Madden,Abstract Previous work [1] has claimed that the best performing implementation of in-memory hash joins is based on (radix-) partitioning of the build-side input. Indeed; despitethe overhead of partitioning; the benefits from increased cache-locality and synchronizationfree parallelism in the build-phase outweigh the costs when the input data is randomlyordered. However; many datasets already exhibit significant spatial locality (ie; non-randomness) due to the way data items enter the database: through periodic ETL or trickleloaded in the form of transactions. In such cases; the first benefit of partitioning—increasedlocality—is largely irrelevant. In this paper; we demonstrate how hardware transactionalmemory (HTM) can render the other benefit; freedom from synchronization; irrelevant aswell.

What Makes a Good Physical plan?: Experiencing Hardware-Conscious Query Optimization with Candomblé,Holger Pirk; Oscar Moll; Sam Madden,Abstract Query optimization is hard and the current proliferation of" modern" hardware doesnothing to make it any easier. In addition; the tools that are commonly used by performanceengineers; such as compiler intrinsics; static analyzers or hardware performance countersare neither integrated with data management systems nor easy to learn. This fact makes it(unnecessarily) hard to educate engineers; to prototype and to optimize database queryplans for modern hardware. To address this problem; we developed a system calledCandomblé that lets database performance engineers interactively examine; optimize andevaluate query plans using a touch-based interface. Candomblé puts attendants in the placeof a physical query optimizer that has to rewrite a physical query plan into a better equivalentplan.

Transaction Processing in the Hybrid OLTP&OLAP Main-Memory Database System HyPer,Alfons Kemper Thomas Neumann Jan Finis; Florian Funke; Viktor Leis Henrik Mühe Tobias Mühlbauer; Wolf Rödiger,Abstract Two emerging hardware trends have re-initiated the development of in-coredatabase systems: ever increasing main-memory capacities and vast multi-core parallelprocessing power. Main-memory capacities of several TB allow to retain all transactionaldata of even the largest applications in-memory on one (or a few) servers. The vastcomputational power in combination with low data management overhead yieldsunprecedented transaction performance which allows to push transaction processing (awayfrom application servers) into the database server and still “leaves room” for additional queryprocessing directly on the transactional data. Thereby; the often postulated goal of real-timebusiness intelligence; where decision makers have access to the latest version of thetransactional state; becomes feasible. In this paper we will survey the HyPerScript …,Data Engineering,2013,*

A stream data model and query language for continuous/stream queries over EO image files and databases,Milena Ivanova; Martin Kersten; Stefan Manegold; Holger Pirk; Erietta Liarou; Romulo Goncalves; Stratos Idreos,Executive Summary In the TELEIOS project; in particular NOA's real-time fire monitoring usecase (work-package 7) requires continuous query processing functionality similar to thatknown from event stream processing of publish/-subscribe scenarios. As opposed to ad-hocquery processing; where one-time queries are evaluated against a stable data base;continuous query processing features long-running queries that are continuously evaluatedagainst ever new arriving data. In general; stream applications gained significant popularityover the last years that lead to the development of specialized stream engines. Thesesystems are designed from scratch with a different philosophy than nowadays databaseengines in order to cope with the stream applications requirements. However; this meansthat they lack the power and sophisticated techniques of a full fledged database system …,*,2011,*

Synopsis: Hybrid Stores-Partitioning into Rows and Columns,Holger Pirk,The real execution time of a database query is not only determined by its theoreticalcomplexity. When run on a real computer other factors like the hardware and the specificimplementation are of influence. It has been shown that within the implementationfactors thememory access pattern has the most influence [4]. This is due to the fact that required data isnot read byte-wise but block-wise (harddisk blocks; memory pages or cachelines). Even ofthe blocks some are faster to read than others due to strategical prefetching (mostly basedon colocation). Organizing data in a way that makes it fast to read by an algorithm is achallenging but profitable task. In a database context this is usually done by an experiencedadministrator (DBA). He needs a lot of knowledge of the internals of the particular DBMS tomake qualified decision on different optimization techniques (indices; materialized views …,*,*,*
