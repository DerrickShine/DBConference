The association between government expenditure and economic growth: Granger causality test of US data; 1947-2002,Louis Chih-hung Liu; Chiehwen Ed Hsu; Mustafa Z Younis,Wagner's Law and Keynesian's theory are two widely accepted yet contrasting propositions.This paper employs Granger causality test on US federal government data; from 1947 to2002. We used aggregate data as well as disaggregate data with the sub-categories of fivefederal expenditures; including: national defense; human resources expenditure; physicalresources expenditure; net interest payment; and other expenditure. The results of our studysuggest that total federal government expenditure is more consistent with Keynesian'stheory while there are diversified causal relationships among five sub-category of federalexpenditure. The policy recommendation generated from this paper is that the US federalgovernment should invest more public resources in human resources expenditure assumingthat economic growth is the utmost important item on the government agenda.,Journal of Public Budgeting; Accounting & Financial Management,2008,37

A review of the Adoption of Just-In-Time method and its effect on efficiency,Hassan Younies; Belal Barhem; C Ed Hsu,Abstract The just-in-time (JIT) process has been around for many years; and it hassuccessfully been implemented by many Japanese companies. Some companies in theUnited States (US) presently use JIT ideas and techniques in their operations. JIT is more ofa philosophy than an actual process. The JIT philosophy emphasizes the performance ofactivities based on immediate need or demand. JIT has primarily been used in themanufacturing area; but it may also be broadly viewed as a procedure for helpingcompanies manage and reduce their total processing times. This paper will discuss the JITprocess mainly as it applies to the manufacturing industry.

Towards Shared Situational Awareness and Actionable Knowledge-An Enhanced; Human-Centered Paradigm for Public Health Information System Design,Chiehwen Ed Hsu; William Chris Chambers; John R Herbold; Joshua C Calcote; Robert S Ryczak; Robert F DeFraites,Abstract Technology has exerted an increasingly dominant influence on the ways andmeans that objectives of informatics projects are pursued and has extended the capabilitiesof informatics systems in general. However; literature examining the importance of humanlinks between situational awareness-related processes and decision-making capabilitiesremains relatively sparse. Substantial knowledge gaps exist in information systemimplementation between technology and public health surveillance. The purpose of thisarticle is to present an enhanced conceptual framework; built upon innovative perspectivesof a human-centered paradigm of implementation; to enable and enhance human-centricdecision-making. To clarify this concept; we employ a case of situational awareness in thesetting of a recent command post exercise in order to illustrate core concepts and …,Journal of Homeland Security and Emergency Management,2010,4
Controlling influenza A (H1N1) in China: Bayesian or frequentist approach,Dejian Lai; Chiehwen Ed Hsu; Jay H Glasser,This article discusses two approaches to controlling the newly identified influenza A (H1N1):via Bayesian and frequentist statistical reasoning. This study reviewed the measuresimplemented in China as an example to illustrate these two approaches. Since May 2009;China has deployed strict controlling mechanisms based on the strong prior Bayesianassumption that the origin of influenza A (H1N1) was from outside China and as such strictborder control would keep the virus from entering China. After more than 4 months of hardwork by Chinese health professionals and officials; the number of confirmed influenza A(H1N1) has increased steadily against the expectations of the general public. Taking intoaccount the great financial burden in maintaining strict measures; Chinese health authoritieshave slowly adjusted their policies of controlling influenza A (H1N1) in China according to …,Asia Pacific Journal of Public Health,2012,2

Incorporating an Improved Delivery Policy into Multi-Item FPR Model with Rework,SINGA WANG CHIU; Cih Hsu; Ting-Wei Li; Hsin-Mei Chen; YUAN-SHYI PETER CHIU,Abstract:-A multi-item finite production rate (FPR) model with rework and an improveddelivery policy is studied in this paper. Unlike the classic FPR model derived the mosteconomic lot size for a single product production system with perfect quality and acontinuous issuing policy; this paper considers a production of multiple products on a singlemachine; rework of all nonconforming items produced; and a cost reduction multi-deliverypolicy. We extend the work of Chiu et al.[1] by incorporating an improved n+ 1 shipmentpolicy into their model and under such a policy; one extra delivery of finished items is madeduring vendor's production uptime to satisfy product demands for the periods of vendor'suptime and rework time. Then; n fixed quantity installments of finished items are delivered tobuyers at the end of rework; when the rest of the production lot is quality assured.

Applying Theoretical Constructs to Address Medical Uncertainty,Roxana Maffei; Kim Dunn; Jiajie Zhang; Chiehwen E Hsu; John H Holmes,Abstract Situations involving medical reasoning usually include some level of medicaluncertainty. Despite the identification of shared decision-making (SDM) as an effectivetechnique; it has been observed that the likelihood of physicians and patients engaging inshared decision making is lower in those situations where it is most needed; specifically incircumstances of medical uncertainty. Having identified shared decision making as aneffective; yet often a neglected approach to resolving a lack of information exchange insituations involving medical uncertainty; the next step is to determine the way (s) in whichSDM can be integrated and the supplemental processes that may facilitate its integration.SDM involves unique types of communication and relationships between patients andphysicians.

Identifying Shared Decision-Making Elements in Medical Encounters Dealing with Uncertainty,Roxana Maffei; Kim Dunn; Jiajie Zhang; Chiehwen E Hsu; John H Holmes,1. Abstract A recent summary of the state of medical knowledge in the US reported thatnearly half (47%) of all treatments were of unknown effectiveness; and an additional 7%involved an uncertain tradeoff between benefits and harms. Shared decision-making (SDM)was identified as an effective technique for managing uncertainty when two or more partieswere involved. In order to understand which of the elements of SDM are used mostfrequently and effectively; it is necessary to identify these key elements; and understand howthese elements related to each other and the SDM process. The elements identified throughthe course of the present research were selected from basic principles of the SDM modeland the “Data; Information; Knowledge;,Understanding and Characterizing Shared Decision-Making and Behavioral Intent in Medical Uncertainty,2011,*

Reexamining an integrated inventory model with multi-retailer and rework using algebraic approach,Yuan-Shyi Peter Chiu; Cih Hsu; Ming-Sheng Hsu; Chun-Chi Kuo,ABSTRACT This paper reexamines an integrated inventory model with multiretailer andrework using mathematical modeling and an algebraic method. We assume that a product ismanufactured through an imperfect production process; and the reworking of randomdefective items is done right after the regular process in each cycle. After the entire lot isquality assured; multiple shipments will be delivered synchronously to m different retailers ineach production cycle. The objective is to find the optimal production lot size and optimalnumber of shipments that minimizes total expected costs for such a specific supply chainssystem. The conventional approach uses differential calculus on system cost function toderive the optimal production-shipment policy (Chiu et al.[1]); whereas the proposedalgebraic approach is a straightforward method that enables practitioners who may not …,*,*,*
