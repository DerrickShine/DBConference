Evaluating clustering in subspace projections of high dimensional data,Emmanuel Müller; Stephan Günnemann; Ira Assent; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Clustering high dimensional data is an emerging research field. Subspaceclustering or projected clustering group similar objects in subspaces; ie projections; of thefull space. In the past decade; several clustering paradigms have been developed inparallel; without thorough evaluation and comparison between these paradigms on acommon basis. Conclusive evaluation and comparison is challenged by three major issues.First; there is no ground truth that describes the" true" clusters in real world data. Second; alarge variety of evaluation measures have been used that reflect different aspects of theclustering result. Finally; in typical publications authors have limited their analysis to theirfavored paradigm only; while paying other paradigms little or no attention.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,230
The ClusTree: indexing micro-clusters for anytime stream mining,Philipp Kranen; Ira Assent; Corinna Baldauf; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Clustering streaming data requires algorithms that are capable of updatingclustering results for the incoming data. As data is constantly arriving; time for processing islimited. Clustering has to be performed in a single pass over the incoming data and withinthe possibly varying inter-arrival times of the stream. Likewise; memory is limited; making itimpossible to store all data. For clustering; we are faced with the challenge of maintaining acurrent result that can be presented to the user at any given time. In this work; we propose aparameter-free algorithm that automatically adapts to the speed of the data stream. It makesbest use of the time available under the current constraints to provide a clustering of theobjects seen up to that point. Our approach incorporates the age of the objects to reflect thegreater importance of more recent data. For efficient and effective handling; we introduce …,Knowledge and information systems,2011,164
DUSC: Dimensionality unbiased subspace clustering,Ira Assent; Ralph Krieger; Emmanuel Müller; Thomas Seidl,To gain insight into today's large data resources; data mining provides automaticaggregation techniques. Clustering aims at grouping data such that objects within groupsare similar while objects in different groups are dissimilar. In scenarios with many attributesor with noise; clusters are often hidden in subspaces of the data and do not show up in thefull dimensional space. For these applications; subspace clustering methods aim atdetecting clusters in any sub-space. Existing subspace clustering approaches fall prey to aneffect we call dimensionality bias. As dimensionality of subspaces varies; approaches whichdo not take this effect into account fail to separate clusters from noise. We give a formaldefinition of dimensionality bias and analyze consequences for subspace clustering. Adimensionality unbiased subspace clustering (DUSC) definition based on statistical …,Data Mining; 2007. ICDM 2007. Seventh IEEE International Conference on,2007,119
Clicks: An effective algorithm for mining subspace clusters in categorical datasets,Mohammed J Zaki; Markus Peters; Ira Assent; Thomas Seidl,Abstract We present a novel algorithm called C licks; that finds clusters in categoricaldatasets based on a search for k-partite maximal cliques. Unlike previous methods; C licksmines subspace clusters. It uses a selective vertical method to guarantee complete search.C licks outperforms previous approaches by over an order of magnitude and scales betterthan any of the existing method for high-dimensional datasets. These results aredemonstrated in a comprehensive performance study on real and synthetic datasets.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2007,116
INSCY: Indexing subspace clusters with in-process-removal of redundancy,Ira Assent; Ralph Krieger; Emmanuel Müller; Thomas Seidl,Subspace clustering aims at detecting clusters in any subspace projection of a highdimensional space. As the number of projections is exponential in the number ofdimensions; efficiency is crucial. Moreover; the resulting subspace clusters are often highlyredundant; ie many clusters are detected multiply in several projections. We propose a novelindex for efficient subspace clustering in a novel depth-first processing with in-process-removal of redundant clusters for better pruning. Thorough experiments on real andsynthetic data show that INSCY yields substantial efficiency and quality improvements.,Data Mining; 2008. ICDM'08. Eighth IEEE International Conference on,2008,83
Approximation techniques for indexing the earth mover’s distance in multimedia databases,Ira Assent; Andrea Wenning; Thomas Seidl,Todays abundance of storage coupled with digital technologies in virtually any scientific orcommercial application such as medical and biological imaging or music archives deal withtremendous quantities of images; videos or audio files stored in large multimedia databases.For content-based data mining and retrieval purposes suitable similarity models are crucial.The Earth Mover's Distance was introduced in Computer Vision to better approach humanperceptual similarities. Its computation; however; is too complex for usage in interactivemultimedia database scenarios. In order to enable efficient query processing in largedatabases; we propose an index-supported multistep algorithm. We therefore develop newlower bounding approximation techniques for the Earth Mover's Distance which satisfy highquality criteria including completeness (no false drops); index-suitability and fast …,Data Engineering; 2006.

The TS-tree: efficient time series search and retrieval,Ira Assent; Ralph Krieger; Farzad Afschari; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Continuous growth in sensor data and other temporal data increases theimportance of retrieval and similarity search in time series data. Efficient time series queryprocessing is crucial for interactive applications. Existing multidimensional indexes like theR-tree provide efficient querying for only relatively few dimensions. Time series are typicallylong which corresponds to extremely high dimensional data in multidimensional indexes.Due to massive overlap of index descriptors; multidimensional indexes degenerate for highdimensions and access the entire data by random I/O. Consequently; the efficiency benefitsof indexing are lost. In this paper; we propose the TS-tree (time series tree); an indexstructure for efficient time series retrieval and similarity search. Exploiting inherent propertiesof time series quantization and dimensionality reduction; the TS-tree indexes high …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,73
Relevant subspace clustering: Mining the most interesting non-redundant concepts in high dimensional data,Emmanuel Müller; Ira Assent; Stephan Günnemann; Ralph Krieger; Thomas Seidl,Subspace clustering aims at detecting clusters in any subspace projection of a highdimensional space. As the number of possible subspace projections is exponential in thenumber of dimensions; the result is often tremendously large. Recent approaches fail toreduce results to relevant subspace clusters. Their results are typically highly redundant; iemany clusters are detected multiple times in several projections. In this work; we propose anovel model for relevant subspace clustering (RESCU). We present a global optimizationwhich detects the most interesting non-redundant subspace clusters. We prove thatcomputation of this model is NP-hard. For RESCU; we propose an approximative solutionthat shows high accuracy with respect to our relevance model.

Outsourced similarity search on metric data assets,Man Lung Yiu; Ira Assent; Christian S Jensen; Panos Kalnis,This paper considers a cloud computing setting in which similarity querying of metric data isoutsourced to a service provider. The data is to be revealed only to trusted users; not to theservice provider or anyone else. Users query the server for the most similar data objects to aquery example. Outsourcing offers the data owner scalability and a low-initial investment.The need for privacy may be due to the data being sensitive (eg; in medicine); valuable (eg;in astronomy); or otherwise confidential. Given this setting; the paper presents techniquesthat transform the data prior to supplying it to the service provider for similarity queries on thetransformed data. Our techniques provide interesting trade-offs between query cost andaccuracy. They are then further extended to offer an intuitive privacy guarantee. Empiricalstudies with real data demonstrate that the techniques are capable of offering privacy …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,64
Efficient emd-based similarity search in multimedia databases via flexible dimensionality reduction,Marc Wichterich; Ira Assent; Philipp Kranen; Thomas Seidl,Abstract The Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) was developed in computer vision as a flexiblesimilarity model that utilizes similarities in feature space to define a high quality similaritymeasure in feature representation space. It has been successfully adopted in a multitude ofapplications with low to medium dimensionality. However; multimedia applicationscommonly exhibit high-dimensional feature representations for which the computationalcomplexity of the EMD hinders its adoption. An efficient query processing approach thatmitigates and overcomes this effect is crucial. We propose novel dimensionality reductiontechniques for the EMD in a filter-and-refine architecture for efficient lossless retrieval.Thorough experimental evaluation on real world data sets demonstrates a substantialreduction of the number of expensive high-dimensional EMD computations and thus …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,60

On the evaluation of unsupervised outlier detection: measures; datasets; and an empirical study,Guilherme O Campos; Arthur Zimek; Jörg Sander; Ricardo JGB Campello; Barbora Micenková; Erich Schubert; Ira Assent; Michael E Houle,Abstract The evaluation of unsupervised outlier detection algorithms is a constant challengein data mining research. Little is known regarding the strengths and weaknesses of differentstandard outlier detection models; and the impact of parameter choices for these algorithms.The scarcity of appropriate benchmark datasets with ground truth annotation is a significantimpediment to the evaluation of outlier methods. Even when labeled datasets are available;their suitability for the outlier detection task is typically unknown. Furthermore; the biases ofcommonly-used evaluation measures are not fully understood. It is thus difficult to ascertainthe extent to which newly-proposed outlier detection methods improve over establishedmethods.

VISA: visual subspace clustering analysis,Ira Assent; Ralph Krieger; Emmanuel Müller; Thomas Seidl,Abstract To gain insight into today's large data resources; data mining extracts interestingpatterns. To generate knowledge from patterns and benefit from human cognitive abilities;meaningful visualization of patterns are crucial. Clustering is a data mining technique thataims at grouping data to patterns based on mutual (dis) similarity. For high dimensionaldata; subspace clustering searches patterns in any subspace of the attributes as patternsare typically obscured by many irrelevant attributes in the full space. For visual analysis ofsubspace clusters; their comparability has to be ensured. Existing subspace clusteringapproaches; however; lack interactive visualization and show bias with respect to thedimensionality of subspaces.

Anyout: Anytime outlier detection on streaming data,Ira Assent; Philipp Kranen; Corinna Baldauf; Thomas Seidl,Abstract With the increase of sensor and monitoring applications; data mining on streamingdata is receiving increasing research attention. As data is continuously generated; miningalgorithms need to be able to analyze the data in a one-pass fashion. In many applicationsthe rate at which the data objects arrive varies greatly. This has led to anytime miningalgorithms for classification or clustering. They successfully mine data until the a prioriunknown point of interruption by the next data in the stream. In this work we investigateanytime outlier detection. Anytime outlier detection denotes the problem of determiningwithin any period of time whether an object in a data stream is anomalous. The more time isavailable; the more reliable the decision should be. We introduce AnyOut; an algorithmcapable of solving anytime outlier detection; and investigate different approaches to build …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2012,53
Outlier ranking via subspace analysis in multiple views of the data,Emmanuel Muller; Ira Assent; Patricia Iglesias; Yvonne Mulle; Klemens Bohm,Outlier mining is an important task for finding anomalous objects. In practice; however; thereis not always a clear distinction between outliers and regular objects as objects havedifferent roles wrt different attribute sets. An object may deviate in one subspace; ie a subsetof attributes. And the same object might appear perfectly regular in other subspaces. Onecan think of subspaces as multiple views on one database. Traditional methods consideronly one view (the full attribute space). Thus; they miss complex outliers that are hidden inmultiple subspaces. In this work; we propose Outrank; a novel outlier ranking concept.Outrank exploits subspace analysis to determine the degree of outlierness. It considersdifferent subsets of the attributes as individual outlier properties. It compares clusteredregions in arbitrary subspaces and derives an outlierness score for each object.

Anticipatory DTW for efficient similarity search in time series databases,Ira Assent; Marc Wichterich; Ralph Krieger; Hardy Kremer; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Time series arise in many different applications in the form of sensor data; stocksdata; videos; and other time-related information. Analysis of this data typically requiressearching for similar time series in a database. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a widelyused high-quality distance measure for time series. As DTW is computationally expensive;efficient algorithms for fast computation are crucial. In this paper; we propose a novel filter-and-refine DTW algorithm called Anticipatory DTW. Existing algorithms aim at efficientlyfinding similar time series by filtering the database and computing the DTW in the refinementstep. Unlike these algorithms; our approach exploits previously unused information from thefilter step during the refinement; allowing for faster rejection of false candidates.

OutRank: ranking outliers in high dimensional data,Emmanuel Muller; Ira Assent; Uwe Steinhausen; Thomas Seidl,Outlier detection is an important data mining task for consistency checks; fraud detection;etc. Binary decision making on whether or not an object is an outlier is not appropriate inmany applications and moreover hard to parametrize. Thus; recently; methods for outlierranking have been proposed. Determining the degree of deviation; they do not requiresetting a decision boundary between outliers and the remaining data. High dimensional andheterogeneous (continuous and categorical attributes) data; however; pose a problem formost outlier ranking algorithms. In this work; we propose our OutRank approach for rankingoutliers in heterogeneous high dimensional data. We introduce a consistent model fordifferent attribute types. Our novel scoring functions transform the analyzed structure of thedata to a meaningful ranking. Promising results in preliminary experiments show the …,Data Engineering Workshop; 2008. ICDEW 2008.

Indexing density models for incremental learning and anytime classification on data streams,Thomas Seidl; Ira Assent; Philipp Kranen; Ralph Krieger; Jennifer Herrmann,Abstract Classification of streaming data faces three basic challenges: it has to deal withhuge amounts of data; the varying time between two stream data items must be used bestpossible (anytime classification) and additional training data must be incrementally learned(anytime learning) for applying the classifier consistently to fast data streams. In this work;we propose a novel index-based technique that can handle all three of the abovechallenges using the established Bayes classifier on effective kernel density estimators. Ournovel Bayes tree automatically generates (adapted efficiently to the individual object to beclassified) a hierarchy of mixture densities that represent kernel density estimators atsuccessively coarser levels.

Explaining outliers by subspace separability,Barbora Micenková; Xuan-Hong Dang; Ira Assent; Raymond T Ng,Outliers are extraordinary objects in a data collection. Depending on the domain; they mayrepresent errors; fraudulent activities or rare events that are subject of our interest. Existingapproaches focus on detection of outliers or degrees of outlierness (ranking); but do notprovide a possible explanation of how these objects deviate from the rest of the data. Suchexplanations would help user to interpret or validate the detected outliers. The problemaddressed in this paper is as follows: given an outlier detected by an existing algorithm; wepropose a method that determines possible explanations for the outlier. These explanationsare expressed in the form of subspaces in which the given outlier shows separability fromthe inliers. In this manner; our proposed method complements existing outlier detectionalgorithms by providing additional information about the outliers.

External evaluation measures for subspace clustering,Stephan Günnemann; Ines Färber; Emmanuel Müller; Ira Assent; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Knowledge discovery in databases requires not only development of novel miningtechniques but also fair and comparable quality assessment based on objective evaluationmeasures. Especially in young research areas where no common measures are available;researchers are unable to provide a fair evaluation. Typically; publications glorify the highquality of one approach only justified by an arbitrary evaluation measure. However; suchconclusions can only be drawn if the evaluation measures themselves are fully understood.In this paper; we provide the basis for systematic evaluation in the emerging research areaof subspace clustering. We formalize general quality criteria for subspace clusteringmeasures not yet addressed in the literature. We compare the existing external evaluationmethods based on these criteria and pinpoint limitations.

Discriminative features for identifying and interpreting outliers,Xuan Hong Dang; Ira Assent; Raymond T Ng; Arthur Zimek; Erich Schubert,We consider the problem of outlier detection and interpretation. While most existing studiesfocus on the first problem; we simultaneously address the equally important challenge ofoutlier interpretation. We propose an algorithm that uncovers outliers in subspaces ofreduced dimensionality in which they are well discriminated from regular objects while at thesame time retaining the natural local structure of the original data to ensure the quality ofoutlier explanation. Our algorithm takes a mathematically appealing approach from thespectral graph embedding theory and we show that it achieves the globally optimal solutionfor the objective of subspace learning. By using a number of real-world datasets; wedemonstrate its appealing performance not only wrt the outlier detection rate but also wrt thediscriminative human-interpretable features.

Efficient similarity search using the Earth Mover's Distance for large multimedia databases,Ira Assent; Marc Wichterich; Tobias Meisen; Thomas Seidl,Multimedia similarity search in large databases requires efficient query processing. TheEarth Mover's Distance; introduced in computer vision; is successfully used as a similaritymodel in a number of small-scale applications. Its computational complexity hindered itsadoption in large multimedia databases. We enable directly indexing the Earth Mover'sDistance in structures such as the R-tree and the VA-file by providing the accurateMinDist'function to any bounding rectangle in the index. We exploit the computational structure of thenew MinDist to derive a new lower bound for the EMD MinDist which is assembled fromquantized partial solutions yielding very fast query processing times.

DensEst: Density estimation for data mining in high dimensional spaces,Emmanuel Müller; Ira Assent; Ralph Krieger; Stephan Günnemann; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Subspace clustering and frequent itemset mining via “step-by-step” algorithms thatsearch the subspace/pattern lattice in a top-down or bottom-up fashion do not scale to largehigh dimensional data bases. Recent “jump” algorithms directly choose candidate subspaceregions or patterns. Their scalability and quality depend heavily on the rating of thesecandidates as mislead jumps incur poor results and costly candidate refinements. Existingtechniques rely on simple statistics with low estimation quality or on inefficient data basescans. In this work; we propose DensEst; an efficient density estimator with significantlyimproved accuracy. It efficiently provides rough estimates of object counts in selectivesubspace regions. Furthermore; by incorporating correlations between dimensions DensEstachieves not only efficient but also highly accurate estimations. We show how this density …,*,2009,35

EDSC: efficient density-based subspace clustering,Ira Assent; Ralph Krieger; Emmanuel Müller; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Subspace clustering mines clusters hidden in subspaces of high-dimensional datasets. Density-based approaches have been shown to successfully mine clusters of arbitraryshape even in the presence of noise in full space clustering. Exhaustive search of all density-based subspace clusters; however; results in infeasible runtimes for large high-dimensionaldata sets. This is due to the exponential number of possible subspace projections in additionto the high computational cost of density-based clustering. In this paper; we proposelossless efficient detection of density-based subspace clusters. In our EDSC (efficientdensity-based subspace clustering) algorithm we reduce the high computational cost ofdensity-based subspace clustering by a complete multistep filter-and-refine algorithm.

Morpheus: interactive exploration of subspace clustering,Emmanuel Müller; Ira Assent; Ralph Krieger; Timm Jansen; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Data mining techniques extract interesting patterns out of large data resources.Meaningful visualization and interactive exploration of patterns are crucial for knowledgediscovery. Visualization techniques exist for traditional clustering in low dimensional spaces.In high dimensional data; clusters typically only exist in subspace projections. This subspaceclustering; however; lacks interactive visualization tools. Challenges arise from typicallylarge result sets in different subspace projections that hinder comparability; visualization andunderstandability.

An unbiased distance-based outlier detection approach for high-dimensional data,Hoang Vu Nguyen; Vivekanand Gopalkrishnan; Ira Assent,Abstract Traditional outlier detection techniques usually fail to work efficiently on high-dimensional data due to the curse of dimensionality. This work proposes a novel method forsubspace outlier detection; that specifically deals with multidimensional spaces wherefeature relevance is a local rather than a global property. Different from existing approaches;it is not grid-based and dimensionality unbiased. Thus; its performance is impervious to gridresolution as well as the curse of dimensionality. In addition; our approach ranks the outliers;allowing users to select the number of desired outliers; thus mitigating the issue of high falsealarm rate. Extensive empirical studies on real datasets show that our approach efficientlyand effectively detects outliers; even in high-dimensional spaces.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2011,24
From stars to galaxies: skyline queries on aggregate data,Matteo Magnani; Ira Assent,Abstract The skyline operator extracts relevant records from multidimensional databasesaccording to multiple criteria. This operator has received a lot of attention because of itsability to identify the best records in a database without requiring to specify complexparameters like the relative importance of each criterion. However; it has only been definedwith respect to single records; while one fundamental functionality of database querylanguages is aggregation; enabling operations over sets of records. In this paper weintroduce aggregate skylines; where the skyline works as a filtering predicate on sets ofrecords. This operator can be used to express queries in the form: return the best groupsdepending on the features of their elements; and thus provides a powerful combination ofgrouping and skyline functionality. We define a semantics for aggregate skylines based …,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,23
Scalable density-based subspace clustering,Emmanuel Müller; Ira Assent; Stephan Günnemann; Thomas Seidl,Abstract For knowledge discovery in high dimensional databases; subspace clusteringdetects clusters in arbitrary subspace projections. Scalability is a crucial issue; as thenumber of possible projections is exponential in the number of dimensions. We propose ascalable density-based subspace clustering method that steers mining to few selectedsubspace clusters. Our novel steering technique reduces subspace processing byidentifying and clustering promising subspaces and their combinations directly. Thereby; itnarrows down the search space while maintaining accuracy. Thorough experiments on realand synthetic databases show that steering is efficient and scalable; with high quality results.For future work; our steering paradigm for density-based subspace clustering opensresearch potential for speeding up other subspace clustering approaches as well.,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,23
OpenSubspace: An open source framework for evaluation and exploration of subspace clustering algorithms in weka,Emmanuel Müller; Ira Assent; Stephan Günnemann; Thomas Seidl,Abstract: Subspace clustering and projected clustering are recent research areas forclustering in high dimensional spaces. As the field is rather young; there is a lack ofcomparative studies on the advantages and disadvantages of the different algorithms. Partof the underlying problem is the lack of available open source implementations that could beused by researchers to understand; compare; and extend subspace and projected clusteringalgorithms. In this paper; we discuss the requirements for open source evaluation software.We propose OpenSubspace; an open source framework that meets these requirements.OpenSubspace integrates state-of-the-art performance measures and visualizationtechniques to foster research in subspace and projected clustering.,Open Source in Data Mining Workshop (OSDM 2009) in conjunction with 13th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD 2009),2009,23
Scalable parallelization of skyline computation for multi-core processors,Sean Chester; Darius Šidlauskas; Ira Assent; Kenneth S Bøgh,The skyline is an important query operator for multi-criteria decision making. It reduces adataset to only those points that offer optimal trade-offs of dimensions. In general; it is veryexpensive to compute. Recently; multicore CPU algorithms have been proposed toaccelerate the computation of the skyline. However; they do not sufficiently minimizedominance tests and so are not competitive with state-of-the-art sequential algorithms. In thispaper; we introduce a novel multicore skyline algorithm; Hybrid; which processes points inblocks. It maintains a shared; global skyline among all threads; which is used to minimizedominance tests while maintaining high throughput. The algorithm uses an efficiently-updatable data structure over the shared; global skyline; based on point-based partitioning.Also; we release a large benchmark of optimized skyline algorithms; with which we …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,22
Clustering high dimensional data,Ira Assent,Abstract High-dimensional data; ie; data described by a large number of attributes; posespecific challenges to clustering. The so-called 'curse of dimensionality'; coined originally todescribe the general increase in complexity of various computational problems asdimensionality increases; is known to render traditional clustering algorithms ineffective. Thecurse of dimensionality; among other effects; means that with increasing number ofdimensions; a loss of meaningful differentiation between similar and dissimilar objects isobserved. As high-dimensional objects appear almost alike; new approaches for clusteringare required. Consequently; recent research has focused on developing techniques andclustering algorithms specifically for high-dimensional data. Still; open research issuesremain.

Local outlier detection with interpretation,Xuan Hong Dang; Barbora Micenková; Ira Assent; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Outlier detection aims at searching for a small set of objects that are inconsistent orconsiderably deviating from other objects in a dataset. Existing research focuses on outlieridentification while omitting the equally important problem of outlier interpretation. Thispaper presents a novel method named LODI to address both problems at the same time. InLODI; we develop an approach that explores the quadratic entropy to adaptively select a setof neighboring instances; and a learning method to seek an optimal subspace in which anoutlier is maximally separated from its neighbors. We show that this learning task can besolved via the matrix eigen-decomposition and its solution contains essential information toreveal features that are most important to interpret the exceptional properties of outliers. Wedemonstrate the appealing performance of LODI via a number of synthetic and real world …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2013,20

Work-efficient parallel skyline computation for the GPU,Kenneth S Bøgh; Sean Chester; Ira Assent,Abstract The skyline operator returns records in a dataset that provide optimal trade-offs ofmultiple dimensions. State-of-the-art skyline computation involves complex tree traversals;data-ordering; and conditional branching to minimize the number of point-to-pointcomparisons. Meanwhile; GPGPU computing offers the potential for parallelizing skylinecomputation across thousands of cores. However; attempts to port skyline algorithms to theGPU have prioritized throughput and failed to outperform sequential algorithms. In thispaper; we introduce a new skyline algorithm; designed for the GPU; that uses a global; staticpartitioning scheme. With the partitioning; we can permit controlled branching to exploittransitive relationships and avoid most point-to-point comparisons. The result is a non-traditional GPU algorithm; SkyAlign; that prioritizes work-efficiency and respectable …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,18
HSM: Heterogeneous subspace mining in high dimensional data,Emmanuel Müller; Ira Assent; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Heterogeneous data; ie data with both categorical and continuous values; iscommon in many databases. However; most data mining algorithms assume eithercontinuous or categorical attributes; but not both. In high dimensional data; phenomena dueto the “curse of dimensionality” pose additional challenges. Usually; due to locally varyingrelevance of attributes; patterns do not show across the full set of attributes. In this paper wepropose HSM; which defines a new pattern model for heterogeneous high dimensional data.It allows data mining in arbitrary subsets of the attributes that are relevant for the respectivepatterns. Based on this model we propose an efficient algorithm; which is aware of theheterogeneity of the attributes. We extend an indexing structure for continuous attributessuch that HSM indexing adapts to different attribute types. In our experiments we show …,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2009,18
Learning Outlier Ensembles: The Best of Both Worlds—Supervised and Unsupervised,Barbora Micenková; Brian McWilliams; Ira Assent,ABSTRACT Years of research in unsupervised outlier detection have produced numerousalgorithms to score data according to their exceptionality. However; the nature of outliersheavily depends on the application context and different algorithms are sensitive to outliersof different nature. This makes it very difficult to assess suitability of a particular algorithmwithout a priori knowledge. On the other hand; in many applications; some examples ofoutliers exist or can be obtained in addition to the vast amount of unlabeled data.Unfortunately; this extra knowledge cannot be simply incorporated into the existingunsupervised algorithms. In this paper; we show how to use powerful machine learningapproaches to combine labeled examples together with arbitrary unsupervised outlierscoring algorithms. We aim to get the best out of the two worlds—supervised and …,Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD 2014 Workshop on Outlier Detection and Description under Data Diversity (ODD2). New York; NY; USA,2014,13
Taking the big picture: representative skylines based on significance and diversity,Matteo Magnani; Ira Assent; Michael L Mortensen,Abstract The skyline is a popular operator to extract records from a database when a recordscoring function is not available. However; the result of a skyline query can be very large.The problem addressed in this paper is the automatic selection of a small number (k)(k) ofrepresentative skyline records. Existing approaches have only focused on partial aspects ofthis problem. Some try to identify sets of diverse records giving an overall approximation ofthe skyline. These techniques; however; are sensitive to the scaling of attributes or to theinsertion of non-skyline records into the database. Others exploit some knowledge of therecord scoring function to identify the most significant record; but not sets of recordsrepresentative of the whole skyline. In this paper; we introduce a novel approach taking boththe significance of all the records and their diversity into account; adapting to available …,The VLDB journal,2014,12
Content-based multimedia retrieval in the presence of unknown user preferences,Christian Beecks; Ira Assent; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Content-based multimedia retrieval requires an appropriate similarity model whichreflects user preferences. When these preferences are unknown or when the structure of thedata collection is unclear; retrieving the most preferable objects the user has in mind ischallenging; as the notion of similarity varies from data to data; from task to task; andultimately from user to user. Based on a specific query object and unknown userpreferences; retrieving the most similar objects according to some default similarity modeldoes not necessarily include the most preferable ones. In this work; we address the problemof content-based multimedia retrieval in the presence of unknown user preferences. Ouridea consists in performing content-based retrieval by considering all possibilities in a familyof similarity models simultaneously. To this end; we propose a novel content-based …,International Conference on Multimedia Modeling,2011,12
Mining probabilistic representative frequent patterns from uncertain data,Chunyang Liu; Ling Chen; Chengqi Zhang,Abstract Probabilistic frequent pattern mining over uncertain data has received a great dealof attention recently due to the wide applications of uncertain data. Similar to its counterpartin deterministic databases; however; probabilistic frequent pattern mining suffers from thesame problem of generating an exponential number of result patterns. The large number ofdiscovered patterns hinders further evaluation and analysis; and calls for the need to find asmall number of representative patterns to approximate all other patterns. This paperformally defines the problem of probabilistic representative frequent pattern (P-RFP) mining;which aims to find the minimal set of patterns with sufficiently high probability to represent allother patterns. The problem's bottleneck turns out to be checking whether a pattern canprobabilistically represent another; which involves the computation of a joint probability of …,*,2013,11
Outlier detection with space transformation and spectral analysis,Xuan Hong Dang; Barbora Micenková; Ira Assent; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Detecting a small number of outliers from a set of data observations is alwayschallenging. In this paper; we present an approach that exploits space transformation anduses spectral analysis in the newly transformed space for outlier detection. Unlike mostexisting techniques in the literature which rely on notions of distances or densities; thisapproach introduces a novel concept based on local quadratic entropy for evaluating thesimilarity of a data object with its neighbors. This information theoretic quantity is used toregularize the closeness amongst data instances and subsequently benefits the process ofmapping data into a usually lower dimensional space. Outliers are then identified by spectralanalysis of the eigenspace spanned by the set of leading eigenvectors derived from themapping procedure. The proposed technique is purely data-driven and imposes no …,*,2013,11
Robust adaptable video copy detection,Ira Assent; Hardy Kremer,Abstract Video copy detection should be capable of identifying video copies subject toalterations eg in video contrast or frame rates. We propose a video copy detection schemethat allows for adaptable detection of videos that are altered temporally (eg frame ratechange) and/or visually (eg change in contrast). Our query processing combines filteringand indexing structures for efficient multistep computation of video copies under this model.We show that our model successfully identifies altered video copies and does so morereliably than existing models.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2009,11
AnyDBC: an efficient anytime density-based clustering algorithm for very large complex datasets,Son T Mai; Ira Assent; Martin Storgaard,Abstract The density-based clustering algorithm DBSCAN is a state-of-the-art data clusteringtechnique with numerous applications in many fields. However; its O (n 2) time complexitystill remains a severe weakness. In this paper; we propose a novel anytime approach tocope with this problem by reducing both the range query and the label propagation time ofDBSCAN. Our algorithm; called AnyDBC; compresses the data into smaller density-connected subsets called primitive clusters and labels objects based on connectedcomponents of these primitive clusters for reducing the label propagation time. Moreover;instead of passively performing the range query for all objects like existing techniques;AnyDBC iteratively and actively learns the current cluster structure of the data and selects afew most promising objects for refining clusters at each iteration. Thus; in the end; it …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining,2016,10
Outlier detection and ranking based on subspace clustering,Thomas Seidl; Emmanuel Müller; Ira Assent; Uwe Steinhausen,Abstract Detecting outliers is an important task for many applications including frauddetection or consistency validation in real world data. Particularly in the presence ofuncertain data or imprecise data; similar objects regularly deviate in their attribute values.The notion of outliers has thus to be defined carefully. When considering outlier detection asa task which is complementary to clustering; binary decisions whether an object is regardedto be an outlier or not seem to be near at hand. For high-dimensional data; however; objectsmay belong to different clusters in different subspaces. More fine-grained concepts to defineoutliers are therefore demanded. By our new OutRank approach; we address outlierdetection in heterogeneous high dimensional data and propose a novel scoring function thatprovides a consistent model for ranking outliers in the presence of different attribute types …,Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings,2009,9
Adaptable Distance Functions for Similarity-based Multimedia Retrieval.,Ira Assent; Marc Wichterich; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Today's abundance of storage coupled with digital technologies in virtually allscientific or commercial applications such as medical and biological imaging or musicarchives deal with tremendous quantities of images; videos or audio files stored in largemultimedia databases. For content-based data mining and multimedia retrieval purposes;suitable similarity models are crucial. Adaptable distance functions are particularly well-suited to match the human perception of similarity. Quadratic Forms (QF) were introduced tocapture the notion of inter-feature similarity which sets them apart from the more traditionalfeature-by-feature measures from eg the Euclidean or Manhattan dissimilarity functions. TheEarth Mover's Distance (EMD) was adopted in Computer Vision to better approach humanperceptual similarities by allowing feature transformation under a number of restrictions …,Datenbank-Spektrum,2006,9
Skyview: a user evaluation of the skyline operator,Matteo Magnani; Ira Assent; Kasper Hornbæk; Mikkel R Jakobsen; Ken Friis Larsen,Abstract The skyline operator has recently emerged as an alternative to ranking queries. Itretrieves a number of potential best options for arbitrary monotone preference functions. Thesuccess of this operator in the database community is based on the belief that users benefitfrom the limited effort required to specify skyline queries compared to; for instance; ranking.While application examples of the skyline operator exist; there is no principled analysis of itsbenefits and limitations in data retrieval tasks. Our study investigates the degree to whichusers understand skyline queries; how they specify query parameters and how they interactwith skyline results made available in listings or map-based interfaces.,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,8
Anytime skyline query processing for interactive systems,Matteo Magnani; Ira Assent; Michael L Mortensen,ABSTRACT In this paper we introduce the concept of anytime skyline query. The skylinedatabase operator returns the top-1 record for every possible monotone record scoringfunction. However; computing a skyline can be very time-consuming depending on the size;distribution and dimensionality of the data; making this operator not applicable to interactivesystems. Therefore; we propose a new computational model for skyline queries where usersmay request a result at any time; eg; immediately after issuing a query. With respect toprevious works; this is achieved by relaxing the requirement that all the records in the resultshould necessarily belong to the skyline at any time. On the contrary; we allow the presenceof non-skyline records as far as they are accurate (ie; close to the actual skyline) andrepresentative (ie; covering different portions of it). We present a first algorithm for anytime …,VLDB Workshop on Ranking in Databases,2012,8
Efficient processing of multiple DTW queries in time series databases,Hardy Kremer; Stephan Günnemann; Anca-Maria Ivanescu; Ira Assent; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a widely used distance measure for time seriesthat has been successfully used in science and many other application domains. As DTW iscomputationally expensive; there is a strong need for efficient query processing algorithms.Such algorithms exist for single queries. In many of today's applications; however; largenumbers of queries arise at any given time. Existing DTW techniques do not processmultiple DTW queries simultaneously; a serious limitation which slows down overallprocessing. In this paper; we propose an efficient processing approach for multiple DTWqueries. We base our approach on the observation that algorithms in areas such as datamining and interactive visualization incur many queries that share certain characteristics.Our solution exploits these shared characteristics by pruning database time series with …,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2011,8
Less is more: Non-redundant subspace clustering,Ira Assent; Emmanuel Müller; Stephan Günnemann; Ralph Krieger; Thomas Seidl,ABSTRACT Clustering is an important data mining task for grouping similar objects. In highdimensional data; however; effects attributed to the “curse of dimensionality”; renderclustering in high dimensional data meaningless. Due to this; recent years have seenresearch on subspace clustering which searches for clusters in relevant subspaceprojections of high dimensional data. As the number of possible subspace projections isexponential in the number of dimensions; the number of possible subspace clusters can beoverwhelming. In this position paper; we present our work on identifying non-redundant;relevant subspace clusters which reduce the result set to a manageable size. We discusstechniques for evaluating; visualizing and exploring subspace clusterings; and proposesome directions for future work.,MultiClust: 1st international workshop on discovering; summarizing and using multiple clusterings held in conjunction with KDD 2010,2010,8
An upper bound for transforming self-verifying automata into deterministic ones,Ira Assent; Sebastian Seibert,Abstract This paper describes a modification of the power set construction for thetransformation of self-verifying nondeterministic finite automata to deterministic ones.

Subspace outlier mining in large multimedia databases,Ira Assent; Ralph Krieger; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Increasingly large multimedia databases in life sciences; e-commerce; ormonitoring applications cannot be browsed manually; but require automatic knowledgediscovery in databases (KDD) techniques to detect novel and interesting patterns. One of themajor tasks in KDD; clustering; aims at grouping similar objects into clusters; separatingdissimilar objects. Density-based clustering has been shown to detect arbitrarily shapedclusters even in noisy data bases. In high-dimensional data bases; meaningful clusters canno longer be detected due to the â€ žcurse of dimensionalityâ€ œ. Consequently; subspaceclustering searches for clusters hidden in any subset of the set of dimensions. As the numberof subspaces is exponential in the number of dimensions; traditional approaches use fixedpruning thresholds. This results in dimensionality bias; ie with growing dimensionality …,Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings,2007,8

Frequent mining tasks on data streams include classification; modeling andoutlier detection.

Efficient caching for constrained skyline queries.,Michael L Mortensen; Sean Chester; Ira Assent; Matteo Magnani,ABSTRACT Constrained skyline queries retrieve all points that optimize some user'spreferences subject to orthogonal range constraints; but at significant computational cost.This paper is the first to propose caching to improve constrained skyline query responsetime. Because arbitrary range constraints are unlikely to match a cached query exactly; ourproposed method identifies and exploits similar cached queries to reduce the computationaloverhead of subsequent ones. We consider interactive users posing a string of similarqueries and show how these can be classified into four cases based on how they overlapcached queries. For each we present a specialized solution. For the general case ofindependent users; we introduce the Missing Points Region (MPR); that minimizes diskreads; and an approximation of the MPR.

MultiClust special issue on discovering; summarizing and using multiple clusterings,Emmanuel Müller; Ira Assent; Stephan Günnemann; Thomas Seidl; Jennifer Dy,Traditionally; clustering has focused on discovering a single grouping of the data. In manyapplications; however; data is collected for multiple analysis tasks. Several features ormeasurements provide complex or high dimensional information. In such data; one typicallyobserves several valid groupings; ie each data object fits in different roles. In contrast totraditional clustering these multiple clusterings describe alternative aspects that characterizethe data in different ways. Traditional single clustering solutions can thus be regarded asspecial cases of multiple clustering solutions; where only a single set of clusters representsone notion of intra-cluster similarity and inter-cluster dissimilarity. The generality of multipleclustering solutions allows capturing multi-faceted information in more than a singlesimilarity notion; while making it more challenging to detect cluster structures.,*,2015,6
Hashcube: A data structure for space-and query-efficient skycube compression,Kenneth S Bøgh; Sean Chester; Ira Assent,Abstract The skyline operator returns records in a dataset that provide optimal trade-offs ofmultiple dimensions. It is an expensive operator whose query performance can greatlybenefit from materialization. However; a skyline can be executed over any subspace ofdimensions; and the materialization of all subspace skylines; called the skycube;dramatically multiplies data size. Existing methods for skycube compression sacrifice toomuch query performance; so; we present a novel hashing-and bitstring-based compresseddata structure that supports orders of magnitude faster query performance.,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2014,6
Frequent pattern mining algorithms for data clustering,Arthur Zimek; Ira Assent; Jilles Vreeken,Abstract Discovering clusters in subspaces; or subspace clustering and related clusteringparadigms; is a research field where we find many frequent pattern mining relatedinfluences. In fact; as the first algorithms for subspace clustering were based on frequentpattern mining algorithms; it is fair to say that frequent pattern mining was at the cradle ofsubspace clustering—yet; it quickly developed into an independent research field. In thischapter; we discuss how frequent pattern mining algorithms have been extended andgeneralized towards the discovery of local clusters in high-dimensional data. In particular;we discuss several example algorithms for subspace clustering or projected clustering aswell as point out recent research questions and open topics in this area relevant toresearchers in either clustering or pattern mining.,*,2014,6
Actively building private recommender networks for evolving reliable relationships,Ira Assent,Recommender systems have been successfully using information from social networks toimprove the quality of results for the targeted users. In this work; we propose a novel modelthat allows users to actively cultivate their recommender network. Building on existingrecommender systems; we suggest providing users with transparent information on userswho might be able to suggest relevant items to their taste. Ensuring that users may keeptheir desired privacy level; this framework allows users to make anonymous contacts. In thisway; the recommender system not only learns user taste; but makes these learnedpreferences transparent and editable. As more and more relevant recommendations byanonymous contacts are made; the recommender network evolves and builds trust betweenreliable contacts that share common interests.,Data Engineering; 2009.

SubClass: Classification of multidimensional noisy data using subspace clusters,Ira Assent; Ralph Krieger; Petra Welter; Jörg Herbers; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Classification has been widely studied and successfully employed in variousapplication domains. In multidimensional noisy settings; however; classification accuracymay be unsatisfactory. Locally irrelevant attributes often occlude class-relevant information.A global reduction to relevant attributes is often infeasible; as relevance of attributes is notnecessarily a globally uniform property. In a current project with an airport schedulingsoftware company; locally varying attributes in the data indicate whether flights will be ontime; delayed or ahead of schedule. To detect locally relevant information; we proposecombining classification with subspace clustering (SubClass). Subspace clustering aims atdetecting clusters in arbitrary subspaces of the attributes. It has proved to work well inmultidimensional and noisy domains. However; it does not utilize class label information …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2008,6

Learning representations for outlier detection on a budget,Barbora Micenková; Brian McWilliams; Ira Assent,Abstract: The problem of detecting a small number of outliers in a large dataset is animportant task in many fields from fraud detection to high-energy physics. Two approacheshave emerged to tackle this problem: unsupervised and supervised. Supervised approachesrequire a sufficient amount of labeled data and are challenged by novel types of outliers andinherent class imbalance; whereas unsupervised methods do not take advantage ofavailable labeled training examples and often exhibit poorer predictive performance. Wepropose BORE (a Bagged Outlier Representation Ensemble) which uses unsupervisedoutlier scoring functions (OSFs) as features in a supervised learning framework. BORE isable to adapt to arbitrary OSF feature representations; to the imbalance in labeled data aswell as to prediction-time constraints on computational cost.

Explanations for Skyline Query Results.,Sean Chester; Ira Assent,ABSTRACT Skyline queries are a well-studied problem for multidimensional data; whereinpoints are returned to the user iff no other point is preferable across all attributes. This leavesonly the points most likely to appeal to an arbitrary user. However; some dominated pointsmay still be interesting; and the skyline offers little support for helping the user understandwhy some interesting points are omitted from the results. In this paper; we introduce the Sky-not query. Given a query point p; a dataset S; and constraints with bounding corners qL andqU; the Sky-not query returns the alternative constraints qL closest to qL for which p is in theskyline. This equips the user with an understanding of not just that a point was dominated;but also how severely. He can then assess himself whether the point is competitive. We firstpropose theoretical results that show how to drastically reduce the input processed by a …,EDBT,2015,5
Effective Privacy-Preserving Online Route Planning,Carmen Ruiz Vicente; Ira Assent; Christian S Jensen,An online Route Planning Service (RPS) computes a route from one location to another.Current RPSs such as Google Maps require the use of precise locations. However; someusers may not want to disclose their source and destination locations due to privacyconcerns. An approach that supplies fake locations to an existing service incurs asubstantial loss of quality of service; and the service may well return a result that may be nothelpful to the user. We propose a solution that is able to return accurate route planningresults when source and destination regions are used in order to achieve privacy. Thesolution re-uses a standard online RPS rather than replicate this functionality; and it needsno trusted third party. The solution is able to compute the exact results without leaking of theexact locations to the RPS or un-trusted parties.

SkyAlign: a portable; work-efficient skyline algorithm for multicore and GPU architectures,Kenneth S Bøgh; Sean Chester; Ira Assent,Abstract The skyline operator determines points in a multidimensional dataset that offersome optimal trade-off. State-of-the-art CPU skyline algorithms exploit quad-tree partitioningwith complex branching to minimise the number of point-to-point comparisons. Branch-phobic GPU skyline algorithms rely on compute throughput rather than partitioning; but fail tomatch the performance of sequential algorithms. In this paper; we introduce a new skylinealgorithm; SkyAlign; that is designed for the GPU; and a GPU-friendly; grid-based treestructure upon which the algorithm relies. The search tree allows us to dramatically reducethe amount of work done by the GPU algorithm by avoiding most point-to-point comparisonsat the cost of some compute throughput. This trade-off allows SkyAlign to achieve orders ofmagnitude faster performance than its predecessors. Moreover; a NUMA-oblivious port of …,The VLDB Journal,2016,4

Thus; in recent years; subspace clustering andprojected clustering approaches were proposed for clustering in high dimensional spaces.As the area is rather young; few comparative studies on the advantages and disadvantagesof the different algorithms exist.

A novel biology inspired model for evolutionary subspace clustering,Ira Assent; Ralph Krieger; Andreas Steffens; Thomas Seidl,Fast growing amounts of application data stored in data bases require automatic patterndetection to enable users to gain an understanding of the gathered information. As a basicdata mining task in this research area; subspace clustering attracts increasing attention. Thetask is to generate meaningful similarity-based groupings in highdimensional and/or noisydata sets which do not exhibit global clusters. The general idea is to locally project theinstances into subspaces of the attributes. Whereas until now subspace clustering has beensuccessfully applied to gene expression data and hand writing recognition; in ourapplication; the task is to detect subspace clusters in financial transaction data.,Proc.

Efficient algorithms for collaborative decision making for large scale settings,Ira Assent,Abstract Collaborative decision making is a successful approach in settings where dataanalysis and querying can be done interactively. In large scale systems with huge datavolumes or many users; collaboration is often hindered by impractical runtimes. Existingwork on improving collaboration focuses on avoiding redundancy for users working on thesame task. While this improves the effectiveness of the user work process; the underlyingquery processing engine is typically considered a" black box" and left unchanged. Researchin multiple query processing; on the other hand; ignores the application; and focuses onimproving runtimes regardless of where the queries are issued from.,Proceedings of the 3rd international workshop on Collaborative information retrieval,2011,3

Anytime OPTICS: An Efficient Approach for Hierarchical Density-Based Clustering,Son T Mai; Ira Assent; Anh Le,Abstract OPTICS is a fundamental data clustering technique that has been widely applied inmany fields. However; it suffers from performance degradation when faced with largedatasets and expensive distance measures because of its quadratic complexity in terms ofboth time and distance function calls. In this paper; we introduce a novel anytime approachto tackle the above problems. The general idea is to use a sequence of lower-bounding (LB)distances of the true distance measure to produce multiple approximations of the truereachability plot of OPTICS. The algorithm quickly produces an approximation result usingthe first LB distance. It then continuously refines the results with subsequent LB distancesand the results from the previous computations.

Multiple Clustering Views via Constrained Projections.,Xuan Hong Dang; Ira Assent; James Bailey,Abstract Clustering; the grouping of data based on mutual similarity; is often used as one ofprincipal tools to analyze and understand data. Unfortunately; most conventional techniquesaim at finding only a single clustering over the data. For many practical applications;especially those being described in high dimensional data; it is common to see that the datacan be grouped into different yet meaningful ways. This gives rise to the recently emergingresearch area of discovering alternative clusterings. In this preliminary work; we propose anovel framework to generate multiple clustering views. The framework relies on aconstrained data projection approach by which we ensure that a novel alternative clusteringbeing found is not only qualitatively strong but also distinctively different from a referenceclustering solution.

This resulted in73.5–97.6% class labeling of the GSM objects (Table 1). Next the labeled objects were usedto annotate the unlabeled objects. We computed the correlation matrix for all the objectswhere the raw data were available and followed the nearest neighbor approach [6] toidentify the nearest labeled object within a δ range. The δ value is an input parameterdetermined empirically and limits the propagation of too dissimilar annotations.

Image clustering and retrieval combining fixed/adaptive-binned histograms and various distance functions,Mladen Jovic; Zoran Stejic; T Seidl; Ira Assent,In the context of content-based image retrieval; we compare two types of histograms; fixedand adaptive; both frequently used for modeling the image features. We demonstrate that achoice of a histogram type; combined with the choice of a distance function; can have ahuge impact onto the clustering structure of the dataset. Such a hierarchical clusteringstructure visualization of database objects helps often the user to find similar objects anddiscover unknown patterns. In our experiments we use real data sets with large number ofsemantic categories; and evaluate both the reachability plots and the clustering accuracy; toshow the effects of appropriate choice of fixed and/or adaptive binning in combination withvarious distance functions.

An Index-Inspired Algorithm for Anytime Classification on Evolving Data Streams,Philipp Kranen; Ira Assent; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Due to the ever growing presence of data streams there has been a considerableamount of research on stream data mining over the past years. Anytime algorithms areparticularly well suited for stream mining; since they flexibly use all available time onstreams of varying data rates; and are also shown to outperform traditional budgetapproaches on constant streams. In this article we present an index-inspired algorithm forBayesian anytime classification on evolving data streams and show its performance onbenchmark data sets.,Datenbank-spektrum,2012,1

Data Mining For Robust Flight Scheduling,Ira Assent; Ralph Krieger; Petra Welter; Jörg Herbers; Thomas Seidl,In scheduling of airport operations the unreliability of flight arrivals is a serious challenge.Robustness with respect to flight delay is incorporated into recent scheduling techniques. Torefine proactive scheduling; we propose classification of flights into delay categories. Ourmethod is based on archived data at major airports in current flight information systems.Classification in this scenario is hindered by the large number of attributes; that mightocclude the dominant patterns of flight delays. As not all of these attributes are equallyrelevant for different patterns; global dimensionality reduction methods are not appropriate.We therefore present a technique which identifies locally relevant attributes for theclassification into flight delay categories. We give an algorithm that efficiently identifiesrelevant attributes. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our technique is …,*,2009,1
Efficient multi-step query processing for EMD-based similarity,Ira Assent; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Similarity search in large multimedia databases requires ef-ficient query processingbased on suitable similarity models. Similarity models consist of a feature extraction step aswell as a distance defined for these features; and they demand an efficient algorithm forretrieving similar objects under this model. In this work; we focus on the Earth MoversDistance (EMD); a recently introduced similarity model which has been successfullyemployed in numerous applications and has been reported as well reflecting humanperceptual similarity. As its computation is complex; the direct application of the EMD tolarge; high-dimensional databases is not feasible. To remedy this and allow users to benefitfrom the high quality of the model even in larger settings; we developed various lowerbounds for the EMD to be used in index-supported multistep query processing algorithms …,Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings,2006,1

Interactive Exploration of Subspace Clusters for High Dimensional Data,Jesper Kristensen; Son T Mai; Ira Assent; Jon Jacobsen; Bay Vo; Anh Le,Abstract PreDeCon is a fundamental clustering algorithm for finding arbitrarily shapedclusters hidden in high-dimensional feature spaces of data; which is an important researchtopic and has many potential applications. However; it suffers from very high runtime as wellas lack of interactions with users. Our algorithm; called AnyPDC; introduces a novelapproach to cope with these problems by casting PreDeCon into an anytime algorithm. Itquickly produces an approximate result and iteratively refines it toward the result ofPreDeCon at the end. This scheme not only significantly speeds up the algorithm but alsoprovides interactions with users during its execution. Experiments conducted on real largedatasets show that AnyPDC acquires good approximate results very early; leading to anorder of magnitude speedup factor compared to PreDeCon.

Efficient Density-Based Subspace Clustering in High Dimensions,Ira Assent,Abstract Density-based clustering defines clusters as dense areas in feature spaceseparated by sparsely populated areas. It is known to successfully identify clusters ofarbitrary shapes even in noisy data. Today; we face increasingly high-dimensional data; iedata objects described by many attributes. Effects attributed to the “curse of dimensionality”mean that in high-dimensional spaces; traditional clustering methods fail to identifymeaningful clusters. In little more than a decade; the research field of subspace clusteringhas established methods for identifying clusters in subsets of the attributes in such high-dimensional spaces. As the number of possible subsets is exponential in the number ofattributes; efficient algorithms are crucial. This short survey discusses challenges in thisarea; and presents models and algorithms for efficient and scalable density-based …,International Workshop on Clustering High-Dimensional Data,2012,*
Mining and representing recommendations in actively evolving recommender systems,Ira Assent,Recommender systems provide an automatic means of filtering out interesting items; usuallybased on past similarity of user ratings. In previous work; we have suggested a model thatallows users to actively build a recommender network. Users express trust; obtaintransparency; and grow (anonymous) recommender connections. In this work; we proposemining such active systems to generate easily understandable representations of therecommender network. Users may review these representations to provide active feedback.This approach further enhances the quality of recommendations; especially as topics ofinterest change over time. Most notably; it extends the amount of control users have over themodel that the recommender network builds of their interests.,Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,*

Subspaceclustering or projected clustering group similar objects in subspaces; ie projections; of thefull space. In the past decade; several clustering paradigms have been developed inparallel; without thorough evaluation and comparison between these paradigms on acommon basis. Conclusive evaluation and comparison is challenged by three major issues.First; there is no ground truth that describes the “true” clusters in real world data. Second; alarge variety of evaluation measures have been used that reflect different aspects of theclustering result. Finally; in typical publications authors have limited their analysis to theirfavored paradigm only; while paying other paradigms little or no attention.

High-Dimensional Indexing for Multimedia Features.,Ira Assent; Stephan Günnemann; Hardy Kremer; Thomas Seidl,Abstract: Efficient content-based similarity search in large multimedia databases requiresefficient query processing algorithms for many practical applications. Especially in high-dimensional spaces; the huge number of features is a challenge to existing indexingstructures. Due to increasing overlap with growing dimensionality; they eventually fail todeliver runtime improvements. In this work; we propose an overlap-free approach toindexing to overcome these problems and allow efficient query processing even on high-dimensional feature vectors. Our method is inspired by separator splits eg in B-trees for one-dimensional data or for sequence data. We transform feature vectors such that overlap-freesplits are ensured. Our algorithm then queries the database with substantially reducednumber of disk accesses; while ensuring correctness and completeness of the result. Our …,BTW,2009,*

Subspace clustering aims todetect clusters in locally relevant subspace of the attributes. We propose to an evolutionarysubspace search approach to detect locally relevant attributes for clustering. Ourevolutionary subspace search optimizes a multi-objective goal; as more than one subspacesare interesting for clustering.
