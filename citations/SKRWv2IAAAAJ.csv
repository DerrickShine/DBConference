Vertebrate pigmentation: from underlying genes to adaptive function,Joanna K Hubbard; J Albert C Uy; Mark E Hauber; Hopi E Hoekstra; Rebecca J Safran,Animal coloration is a powerful model for studying the genetic mechanisms that determinephenotype. Genetic crosses of laboratory mice have provided extensive information aboutthe patterns of inheritance and pleiotropic effects of loci involved in pigmentation. Recently;the study of pigmentation genes and their functions has extended into wild populations;providing additional evidence that pigment gene function is largely conserved acrossdisparate vertebrate taxa and can influence adaptive coloration; often in predictable ways.These new and integrative studies; along with those using a genetic approach to understandcolor perception; raise some important questions. Most notably; how does selection shapeboth phenotypic and genetic variation; and how can we use this information to furtherunderstand the phenotypic diversity generated by evolutionary processes?,Trends in Genetics,2010,199
Plumage coloration; not length or symmetry of tail-streamers; is a sexually selected trait in North American barn swallows,Rebecca J Safran; Kevin J McGraw,Abstract Sexual adornments often vary markedly across a species' range; which presumablyis owing to differences in local environmental conditions and the associated selectionpressures; such as natural versus sexual selection or the relative signaling value of differentornamental traits. However; there are only a few reported examples in which the informationcontent of mating signals varies geographically; and even fewer in which a set of secondarysexual traits serves different signaling functions in different populations. Classic studies ofsexual selection in the European barn swallow (Hirundo rustica rustica) demonstrate thatelongate tail-streamers provide several reproductive advantages to males and females andare used as reliable signals of mate quality. Here; we show that tail-streamers do not appearto confer these same benefits in a population of barn swallows from North America …,Behavioral Ecology,2004,156
Evolutionary divergence in acoustic signals: causes and consequences,Matthew R Wilkins; Nathalie Seddon; Rebecca J Safran,Acoustic signals mediate mate choice; resource defense; and species recognition in a broadrange of taxa. It has been proposed; therefore; that divergence in acoustic signals plays akey role in speciation. Nonetheless; the processes driving divergence of acoustic traits andtheir consequences in terms of speciation are poorly understood. A review of empirical andcomparative studies reveals strong support for a role of sexual selection in acousticdivergence; but the possible concomitant influences of ecological context are rarelyexamined. We summarize a conceptual framework for testing the relative significance ofboth adaptive and neutral mechanisms leading to acoustic divergence; predictions for caseswhere these processes lead to speciation; and how their relative importance plays out overevolutionary time.,Trends in ecology & evolution,2013,144
Interspecific differences in habitat use of shorebirds and waterfowl foraging in managed wetlands of California's San Joaquin Valley,CR Isola; MA Colwell; OW Taft; RJ Safran,A common wetland management objective is to provide habitat for a diverse assemblage ofspecies; which requires data on interspecific differences in habitat use. Consequently; westudied habitat use by ten waterbird taxa (four dabbling ducks and six shorebirds) foragingin managed; seasonal wetlands in the northern San Joaquin Valley; California during latewinter and early spring of 1994 and 1995. A MANOVA analysis detected strong interspecificdifferences in habitat use; with water depth explaining 86% of differences among taxa in adiscriminant function analysis. ANOVA identified four groups based on similarities in use ofwater depth: 1) small shorebirds (< 5 cm); 2) large shorebirds (5-11 cm); 3) teal (10-15 cm);and large dabbling ducks (> 20 cm). Among these groups; variation in water depth atforaging locations increased with size; suggesting that water depth constrained foraging …,Waterbirds,2000,126
Dynamic paternity allocation as a function of male plumage color in barn swallows,RJ Safran; CR Neuman; KJ McGraw; IJ Lovette,Paternity in male animals can be influenced by their phenotypic signals of quality.Accordingly; the behavior underlying patterns of paternity should be flexible as signals ofquality change. To evaluate the dynamics of paternity allocation; we analyzed paternitybefore and after manipulating plumage coloration; a known signal of quality; in male barnswallows Hirundo rustica. We found that; in successive breeding bouts; only males whoseplumage color was experimentally enhanced received greater paternity from their socialmates; demonstrating evidence for flexible and dynamic paternity allocation and theimportance for males of maintaining signals of quality well after pair bond formation.,Science,2005,120

You can't judge a pigment by its color: carotenoid and melanin content of yellow and brown feathers in swallows; bluebirds; penguins; and domestic chickens,Kevin J McGraw; Kazumasa Wakamatsu; Shosuke Ito; Paul M Nolan; Pierre Jouventin; F Stephen Dobson; Richard E Austic; Rebecca J Safran; Lynn M Siefferman; Geoffrey E Hill; Robert S Parker,Abstract The two main pigment types in bird feathers are the red; orange; and yellowcarotenoids and the black; gray; and brown melanins. Reports conflict; however; regardingthe potential for melanins to produce yellow colors or for carotenoids to produce brownplumages. We used high-performance liquid chromatography to analyze carotenoids andmelanins present in the yellow and brown feathers of five avian species: Eastern Bluebirds(Sialia sialis); Barn Swallows (Hirundo rustica); King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus);Macaroni Penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus); and neonatal chickens (Gallus domesticus). Innone of these species did we detect carotenoid pigments in feathers. Although carotenoidsare reportedly contained in the ventral plumage of European Barn Swallows (Hirundorustica rustica); we instead found high concentrations of both eumelanins and …,The Condor,2004,107
How feather colour reflects its melanin content,KJ McGraw; RJ Safran; K Wakamatsu,Previous article in issue: Do faster starts increase the probability of evading predators … Previousarticle in issue: Do faster starts increase the probability of evading predators … 1Melanin colorationis the most common type of colour in animals. Many species use melanin-based black;brown; grey or earth-toned colours as intraspecific signals of quality … 2Melanin comes in twomain forms in vertebrates – eumelanin and phaeomelanin – and these are said to create differentcolours; with eumelanin giving a darker black; brown or grey appearance and phaeomelanina lighter reddish or buff hue … 3However; the few studies that have examined the melanin contentof animal colours; namely from bird feathers; have shown that both phaeomelanin and eumelaninare present in nearly all melanized patches.

Sexual signal exaggeration affects physiological state in male barn swallows,Rebecca J Safran; James S Adelman; Kevin J McGraw; Michaela Hau,Summary A prevailing view in sexual selection theory is that costly physiological processesunderlie the development; maintenance and expression of sexual signals; and that the costsof these signals enforce their honesty [1; 2]. However; this unidirectional view of howphysiology governs signal expression is narrow; because many of the putative physiologicalunderpinnings of signals; such as health status; are themselves dynamic [3]. As such; wepredicted that physiological parameters should be affected by sexual signal expression. Wetherefore manipulated a known sexual signal—plumage coloration—in male barn swallows(Hirundo rustica erythrogaster) and measured circulating androgen levels and body massbefore and after the manipulation. We found that androgen concentrations increased in color-enhanced males; but decreased in control males; as expected due to typical seasonal …,Current Biology,2008,87
Contributions of natural and sexual selection to the evolution of premating reproductive isolation: a research agenda,Rebecca J Safran; Elizabeth SC Scordato; Laurel B Symes; Rafael L Rodríguez; Tamra C Mendelson,Speciation by divergent natural selection is well supported. However; the role of sexualselection in speciation is less well understood due to disagreement about whether sexualselection is a mechanism of evolution separate from natural selection; as well as confusionabout various models and tests of sexual selection. Here; we outline how sexual selectionand natural selection are different mechanisms of evolutionary change; and suggest that thisdistinction is critical when analyzing the role of sexual selection in speciation. Furthermore;we clarify models of sexual selection with respect to their interaction with ecology andnatural selection. In doing so; we outline a research agenda for testing hypotheses about therelative significance of divergent sexual and natural selection in the evolution ofreproductive isolation.,Trends in ecology & evolution,2013,82
Sexual selection accelerates signal evolution during speciation in birds,Nathalie Seddon; Carlos A Botero; Joseph A Tobias; Peter O Dunn; Hannah EA MacGregor; Dustin R Rubenstein; J Albert C Uy; Jason T Weir; Linda A Whittingham; Rebecca J Safran,Sexual selection is proposed to be an important driver of diversification in animal systems;yet previous tests of this hypothesis have produced mixed results and the mechanismsinvolved remain unclear. Here; we use a novel phylogenetic approach to assess theinfluence of sexual selection on patterns of evolutionary change during 84 recent speciationevents across 23 passerine bird families. We show that elevated levels of sexual selectionare associated with more rapid phenotypic divergence between related lineages; and thatthis effect is restricted to male plumage traits proposed to function in mate choice andspecies recognition. Conversely; we found no evidence that sexual selection promoteddivergence in female plumage traits; or in male traits related to foraging and locomotion.These results provide strong evidence that female choice and male–male competition are …,Proc.

Benthic invertebrates at foraging locations of nine waterbird species in managed wetlands of the northern San Joaquin Valley; California,Rebecca J Safran; Craig R Isola; Mark A Colwell; Oriane E Williams,Abstract The ecologies of waterbirds are closely tied to the distribution and abundance offood resources. For many species of waterfowl and shorebirds; benthic invertebrates(especially Chironomidae) are an important dietary component that influences habitatselection. Consequently; we sampled benthic invertebrates and measured water depth atforaging locations of nine waterbird species and paired random sites in the Grasslands ofthe northern San Joaquin Valley; California; USA from January to April 1994 and 1995. Ourresulting habitat-selection models indicate significant differences in benthic invertebratedensities or biomasses at foraging and random locations for three of nine species andsignificant differences in water depths between foraging and random locations for four ofnine species. Additionally; we observed significant interspecific differences in water …,Wetlands,1997,79
Adaptive site selection rules and variation in group size of barn swallows: individual decisions predict population patterns,Rebecca Jo Safran,Abstract: Variation in group size is ubiquitous among socially breeding organisms. Analternative to the traditional examination of average reproductive success in groups ofdifferent sizes is to examine individual decision making by determining the cues used for siteselection. Once factors used for decision making are known; one can determine whethergroup-level patterns; such as group size variation; are emergent properties of individual-level decision rules. The advantage of this alternative approach is that it can explain thedistribution of group sizes rather than just the occurrence of optimal group sizes. Using barnswallows; I tested; but did not support; the hypothesis that individuals settle at sites based onthe previous success of conspecifics (ie; performance-based conspecific attraction). Instead;I demonstrate that an adaptive site selection decision rule—to breed where it is possible …,The American Naturalist,2004,70
Are yolk androgens and carotenoids in barn swallow eggs related to parental quality?,Rebecca J Safran; Kevin M Pilz; Kevin J McGraw; Stephanie M Correa; Hubert Schwabl,Abstract Recently; evidence is mounting that females can adaptively engineer the quality oftheir offspring via the deposition of yolk compounds; including carotenoids and androgens.In this study; we simultaneously consider how both carotenoids and androgens in egg yolkrelate to parental quality in barn swallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster). First; we found norelationship between concentrations or amounts of yolk androgens and carotenoids. Yolkcarotenoids decreased with laying order; whereas we found no relationship between yolkandrogens and laying order. Second; we tested the Investment Hypothesis; which predictsthat high-quality females or females paired to high quality mates; allocate differentially moreof these yolk compounds to their offspring. For carotenoids; we mostly found evidence tocounter predictions of the Investment hypothesis:(1) Carotenoid concentrations varied …,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,2008,68
European barn swallows use melanin pigments to color their feathers brown,Kevin J McGraw; Rebecca J Safran; Matthew R Evans; Kazumasa Wakamatsu,The barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) has figured largely in studies of sexual selection andexaggerated traits (Møller; 1994; 2001). In addition to the elongate tail streamers that confera series of reproductive advantages to individuals in European populations; these birdsdevelop a brown patch of feathers on the face and throat that has also been the focus ofseveral empirical tests of honest advertisement theory (eg Camplani et al.; 1999; Saino etal.; 1999). Researchers studying this trait have assumed that these feathers containcarotenoids; and several conclusions have been drawn about the physiological and sexualfunctions of carotenoids in relation to this color ornament (Camplani et al.; 1999; Saino et al.;1999). However; to date there is no biochemical evidence in the primary literaturesupporting the idea that brown feathers in barn swallows contain carotenoids. Here; we …,Behavioral Ecology,2004,55
The sexual signals of the East-Mediterranean barn swallow: a different swallow tale,Yoni Vortman; Arnon Lotem; Roi Dor; Irby J Lovette; Rebecca J Safran,Abstract The differential functions of distinct morphological traits as sexual signals amongclosely related populations are associated with a potential role of sexual selection inpopulation divergence and speciation. The cosmopolitan barn swallow Hirundo rusticacomplex consists of 6 subspecies; which differ substantially in tail streamer length andventral coloration. Two of these subspecies—the European and North American subspecies—have been extensively studied. Though they are closely related; differentially exaggeratedtraits in these two subspecies appear to be the result of stronger sexual selection on taillength in Europe and ventral color in North America. The nonmigratory East-Mediterraneansubspecies H. r. transitiva possesses both elongated long tail streamers and dark (brown-red) ventral coloration. We explored whether the expression of both traits is related to …,Behavioral Ecology,2011,45
Environmental harshness is positively correlated with intraspecific divergence in mammals and birds,Carlos A Botero; Roi Dor; Christy M McCain; Rebecca J Safran,Abstract Life on Earth is conspicuously more diverse in the tropics. Although this intriguinggeographical pattern has been linked to many biotic and abiotic factors; their relativeimportance and potential interactions are still poorly understood. The way in whichlatitudinal changes in ecological conditions influence evolutionary processes is particularlycontroversial; as there is evidence for both a positive and a negative latitudinal gradient inspeciation rates. Here; we identify and address some methodological issues (how patternsare analysed and how latitude is quantified) that could lead to such conflicting results. Toaddress these issues; we assemble a comprehensive data set of the environmentalcorrelates of latitude (including climate; net primary productivity and habitat heterogeneity)and combine it with biological; historical and molecular data to explore global patterns in …,Molecular ecology,2014,43
Phylogeny of the genus Hirundo and the Barn Swallow subspecies complex,Roi Dor; Rebecca J Safran; Frederick H Sheldon; David W Winkler; Irby J Lovette,Abstract The cosmopolitan Barn Swallow complex (Hirundo rustica and related Hirundospecies) provides a model system for studies of mate choice; sexual selection; and relatedtopics in behavioral ecology; but the phylogenetic and phylogeographic relationships withinthis group are not yet completely resolved. We reconstructed the phylogeny of all 14 speciesof Hirundo as well as all six Barn Swallow (H. rustica) subspecies using maximum likelihoodand Bayesian methods based on sequences of mitochondrial DNA from six protein-codinggenes (5217 bp) and one nuclear intron (1039 bp) for most taxa. We found four well-supported clades within the genus; but low support values for one node decreased ourability to determine the relationships among them. H. rustica is recently derived and has awide geographic distribution; and its six subspecies form a monophyletic group with …,Molecular phylogenetics and evolution,2010,42
Foraging site selection by nonbreeding White-faced Ibis,Rebecca J Safran; Mark A Colwell; Craig R Isola; Oriane E Taft,Abstract We examined foraging site selection by White-faced Ibis (Plegadis chihi) winteringin the Grasslands Ecological Area; which contains the second largest population ofnonbreeding ibis in California. We compared habitat variables at White-faced Ibis foragingsites with paired; random locations in managed wetlands of the Grasslands. We contrastedthe density and biomass of benthic macroinvertebrates between a subsample of birdforaging locations and random sites. Compared to random locations; the foraging locationsof White-faced Ibis were closer to emergent vegetation> 10 cm in height. Moreover; ibisselected foraging locations with significantly higher chironomid and lower oligochaetebiomasses relative to random sites.

Co‐evolution of plumage characteristics and winter sociality in New and Old World sparrows,EA Tibbetts; RJ Safran,Abstract Understanding the evolution of phenotypic diversity; including the stunning array ofavian plumage characters; is a central goal of evolutionary biology. Here; we applied acomparative analysis to test factors associated with the origin and maintenance of blackchest and throat patches; which in some taxa are referred to as 'badges-of-status'.Specifically; we tested whether the evolution of black colour patches in Old and New Worldsparrows is consistent with a signalling function during the nonbreeding season or breedingseason. We found no positive associations between patch evolution and polygyny orsummer sociality. Instead; patch evolution is significantly associated with sociality during thenonbreeding season. Additionally; unlike typical plumage characteristics under sexualselection; these patches are visible throughout the nonbreeding season. Further; the …,Journal of Evolutionary Biology,2009,38
An experimental analysis of the heritability of variation in glucocorticoid concentrations in a wild avian population,Brittany R Jenkins; Maren N Vitousek; Joanna K Hubbard; Rebecca J Safran,Glucocorticoid hormones (CORT) are predicted to promote adaptation to variableenvironments; yet little is known about the potential for CORT secretion patterns to respondto selection in free-living populations. We assessed the heritable variation underlyingdifferences in hormonal phenotypes using a cross-foster experimental design with nestlingNorth American barn swallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster). Using a bivariate animalmodel; we partitioned variance in baseline and stress-induced CORT concentrations intotheir additive genetic and rearing environment components and estimated their geneticcorrelation. Both baseline and stress-induced CORT were heritable with heritability of 0.152and 0.343; respectively. We found that the variation in baseline CORT was best explainedby rearing environment; whereas the variation in stress-induced CORT was contributed to …,Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences,2014,37
Pterin‐based ornamental coloration predicts yolk antioxidant levels in female striped plateau lizards (Sceloporus virgatus),Stacey L Weiss; Eileen A Kennedy; Rebecca J Safran; Kevin J McGraw,Summary 1. Maternal investment in egg quality can have important consequences foroffspring fitness. For example; yolk antioxidants can affect embryonic development as wellas juvenile and adult phenotype. Thus; females may be selected to advertise their yolkantioxidant deposition to discriminatory males via ornamental signals; perhaps dependingon the reproductive costs associated with signal production.,Journal of Animal Ecology,2011,35
Variation in the temporal and spatial use of signals and its implications for multimodal communication,J Albert C Uy; Rebecca J Safran,Abstract The use of signals across multiple sensory modalities in communication is commonin animals and plants. Determining the information that each signal component conveys hasprovided unique insights into why multimodal signals evolve. However; how these complexsignals are assessed by receivers will also influence their evolution; a hypothesis that hasreceived less attention. Here; we explore multimodal signal assessment in a closely relatedcomplex of island flycatchers that have diverged in visual and acoustic signals. Using fieldexperiments that manipulated song and plumage colour; we tested if song; a possible long-range signal; is assessed before plumage colour in conspecific recognition. We find thatdivergent song and colour are assessed in sequence; and this pattern of sequentialassessment is likely mediated by habitat structure and the extent of differences in signal …,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,2013,34
Multiple Sexual Signals and Behavioral Reproductive Isolation in a Diverging Population,Yoni Vortman; Arnon Lotem; Roi Dor; Irby Lovette; Rebecca J Safran,Abstract Sexual trait divergence has been shown to play a role in the evolution ofreproductive isolation. While variation in multiple sexual signals is common among closelyrelated species; little is known about the role of these different axes of phenotype variationwith respect to the evolution of behavioral reproductive isolation. Here we study a uniquepopulation of barn swallows (Hirundo rustica transitiva) that can be distinguishedphenotypically from its neighboring populations only on the basis of two features of maleplumage: exaggerated expression of both long tail streamers and dark ventral coloration.Using phenotype manipulation experiments; we conducted a paternity study to examinewhether both traits are sexually selected. Our results show that an exaggerated form of thelocal male phenotype (with both tail elongation and color darkening) is favored by local …,The American Naturalist,2013,31
Positive carotenoid balance correlates with greater reproductive performance in a wild bird,Rebecca J Safran; Kevin J McGraw; Matthew R Wilkins; Joanna K Hubbard; Julie Marling,Background Carotenoids can confer somatic and reproductive benefits; but most evidence isfrom captive animal experimentation or single time-point sampling. Another perhaps moreinformative means by which to assess physiological contributions to animal performance isby tracking an individual's ability to increase or sustain carotenoids or other health-relatedmolecules over time; as these are likely to be temporally variable. Methodology/PrincipalFindings In a field study of North American barn swallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster);we analyzed within-individual changes in carotenoid concentrations by repeatedly samplingthe carotenoid profiles of individuals over the course of the breeding season. Our resultsdemonstrate that carotenoid concentrations of individuals are temporally dynamic and thatseason-long balance of these molecules; rather than single time-point samples; predict …,PloS One,2010,31
Stress and success: Individual differences in the glucocorticoid stress response predict behavior and reproductive success under high predation risk,Maren N Vitousek; Brittany R Jenkins; Rebecca J Safran,Abstract A fundamental element of how vertebrates respond to stressors is by rapidlyelevating circulating glucocorticoid hormones. Individual variation in the magnitude of theglucocorticoid stress response has been linked with reproductive success and survival. Butwhile the adaptive value of this response is believed to stem in part from changes in theexpression of hormone-mediated behaviors; it is not clear how the behavior of stronger andweaker glucocorticoid responders differs during reproduction; or during exposure toecologically relevant stressors. Here we report that in a population of barn swallows(Hirundo rustica erythrogaster) experiencing high rates of nest predation; circulating levelsof corticosterone (the primary avian glucocorticoid) during exposure to a standardizedstressor predict aspects of subsequent behavior and fitness. Individuals that mounted a …,Hormones and behavior,2014,28
Geographic variation in sexual selection and implications for speciation in the Barn Swallow,Elizabeth SC Scordato; Rebecca J Safran,Barn Swallows (Hirundo rustica); a group of passerine birds comprised of six closely relatedsubspecies; are well known throughout their nearly worldwide distribution; in part becauseof their close association with human settlements. A tractable species for both individual-based and population-level studies; Barn Swallows are a prominent model system inevolutionary; ecological; and behavioral research. Here we review work on sexual selectionand population divergence in this species complex; focusing on comparative studies amongpopulations and subspecies. We summarize variation in the targets of mate choice and inthe information conveyed by sexually selected traits; and conclude that the benefitsadvertised by different traits may vary geographically. Finally; we consider the role of sexualselection as a driver of population divergence in this widespread and phenotypically …,*,2014,27
The Role of Ecology in Speciation by Sexual Selection: A Systematic Empirical Review,Elizabeth SC Scordato; Laurel B Symes; Tamra C Mendelson; Rebecca J Safran,Theoretical and empirical research indicates that sexual selection interacts with theecological context in which mate choice occurs; suggesting that sexual and natural selectionact together during the evolution of premating reproductive isolation. However; the relativeimportance of natural and sexual selection to speciation remains poorly understood. Here;we applied a recent conceptual framework for examining interactions between mate choicedivergence and ecological context to a review of the empirical literature on speciation bysexual selection. This framework defines two types of interactions between mate choice andecology: internal interactions; wherein natural and sexual selection jointly influencedivergence in sexual signal traits and preferences; and external interactions; wherein sexualselection alone acts on traits and preferences but ecological context shapes the …,Journal of Heredity,2014,27
Morphological and genetic predictors of parental care in the North American barn swallow Hirundo rustica erythrogaster,Sarah E Maguire; Rebecca J Safran,Abstract Sexually dimorphic traits often signal the fitness benefits an individual can provideto potential mates. In species with altricial young; these signals may also predict the level ofparental care an individual is expected to provide to shared offspring. In this study; we testedthree hypotheses that traditionally relate sexually dimorphic traits to parental care in twopopulations of North American barn swallows Hirundo rustica erythrogaster. The goodparent hypothesis predicts a positive relationship between an individual's ornamentationand his or her care whereas the differential allocation (more care given by individuals whenpaired to high quality mates) and reproductive compensation (more care given byindividuals when paired to low quality mates) hypotheses predict that an individual's level ofparental investment is relative to the quality of their mate.

Female plumage colour influences seasonal oxidative damage and testosterone profiles in a songbird,Maren N Vitousek; Rosemary A Stewart; Rebecca J Safran,Across diverse taxa; morphological traits mediate social interactions and mate selection.Physiological constraints on signal elaboration have been widely documented; but thepotential for trait display to influence physiological state remains poorly understood. Wetested for the presence of causal links between ventral plumage colour—a trait known tocovary with reproductive performance—and physiological measures in female NorthAmerican barn swallows; Hirundo rustica erythrogaster. Naturally darker swallows havelower levels of plasma oxidative damage.

These results support the presence of asocial mechanism that links static plumage traits with the physiological state of their …,Biology letters,2013,26
Low variation in the polymorphic Clock gene Poly-Q region despite population genetic structure across barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) populations,Roi Dor; Irby J Lovette; Rebecca J Safran; Shawn M Billerman; Gernot H Huber; Yoni Vortman; Arnon Lotem; Andrew McGowan; Matthew R Evans; Caren B Cooper; David W Winkler,Recent studies of several species have reported a latitudinal cline in the circadian clockgene; Clock; which influences rhythms in both physiology and behavior. Latitudinal variationin this gene may hence reflect local adaptation to seasonal variation. In some birdpopulations; there is also an among-individual association between Clock poly-Q genotypeand clutch initiation date and incubation period. We examined Clock poly-Q allele variationin the Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica); a species with a cosmopolitan geographic distributionand considerable variation in life-history traits that may be influenced by the circadian clock.We genotyped Barn Swallows from five populations (from three subspecies) and comparedvariation at the Clock locus to that at microsatellite loci and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).

Population genetics and morphological comparisons of migratory European (Hirundo rustica rustica) and sedentary East-Mediterranean (Hirundo rustica transitiva)...,Roi Dor; Rebecca J Safran; Yoni Vortman; Arnon Lotem; Andrew McGowan; Matthew R Evans; Irby J Lovette,Abstract Speciation processes are largely determined by the relative strength of divergentselection versus the magnitude of gene flow. The barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) has abroad geographic distribution that encompasses substantial geographic variation inmorphology and behavior. The European (H. r. rustica) and East-Mediterranean (H. r.transitiva) subspecies are closely related; despite differing in morphological and life-historytraits. To explore patterns of genetic differentiation and gene flow; we comparedmorphological and genetic variation among the nonmigratory breeding population of H. r.transitiva from Israel and the migratory population of H. r. rustica that passes through Israeland compared it with the genetic differentiation between H. r. transitiva from Israel and abreeding population of H. r. rustica from the United Kingdom that uses a different …,Journal of Heredity,2011,26
Age before beauty? Relationships between fertilization success and age-dependent ornaments in barn swallows,Jan T Lifjeld; Oddmund Kleven; Frode Jacobsen; Kevin J McGraw; Rebecca J Safran; Raleigh J Robertson,Abstract When males become more ornamented and reproduce more successfully as theygrow older; phenotypic correlations between ornament exaggeration and reproductivesuccess can be confounded with age effects in cross-sectional studies; and thus sayrelatively little about sexual selection on these traits. This is exemplified here in a correlativestudy of male fertilization success in a large colony of American barn swallows (Hirundorustica erythrogaster). Previous studies of this species have indicated that two sexuallydimorphic traits; tail length and ventral plumage coloration; are positively correlated withmale fertilization success; and a mechanism of sexual selection by female choice has beeninvoked. However; these studies did not control for potential age-related variation in traitexpression. Here; we show that male fertilization success was positively correlated with …,Behavioral ecology and sociobiology,2011,26

Group breeding in vertebrates: linking individual-and population-level approaches,Rebecca J Safran; Veronica AJ Doerr; Paul W Sherman; Erik D Doerr; Samuel M Flaxman; David W Winkler,Background: Why individuals breed in groups and why patterns of group breeding are sovariable are long-standing questions in evolutionary ecology. Researchers have tended tostudy either population-level patterns such as breeding group size or else the decisions thatindividuals make when joining groups; but have rarely explicitly linked the two; usingknowledge of individual decisions to predict larger-scale population patterns. Aim: Wedescribe an integrated method designed to categorize and explain a diversity of vertebratesocial systems; with a focus on colonial breeding. This approach places group breedingwithin an evolutionary context by first elucidating the process of group formation; identifyingdecision rules that individuals use when joining groups; and verifying their fitnessconsequences; then using these individual-level processes to predict and understand …,Evolutionary Ecology Research,2007,24

Nest-site selection in the barn swallow; Hirundo rustica: What predicts seasonal reproductive success?,Rebecca J Safran,Despite hundreds of studies; we know very little about the causes and fitness-relatedconsequences of nest-site selection. For example; it is not typically known whether the rarelyreported fitness consequences of site selection are the result of nest; individual; or nest-sitevariables or combinations of these factors. Reuse of previously constructed nest sites is aprevalent behavior in many animals and offers the opportunity to experimentally tease apartwhether seasonal reproductive success is a function of nest; individual; or nest-sitecharacteristics. I used observational and experimental data to test three hypotheses relatedto these factors in association with barn swallow (Hirundo rustica L.; 1758) nest reuse. Whileboth nest and individual characteristics explain variation in seasonal reproductive success;nest location per se is not an important factor defining the outcome of nest-site selection …,Canadian journal of zoology,2006,23
Signaling stress? An analysis of phaeomelanin-based plumage color and individual corticosterone levels at two temporal scales in North American barn swallows; H...,Brittany R Jenkins; Maren N Vitousek; Rebecca J Safran,Abstract Sexually selected traits confer greater reproductive benefits to individuals with moreelaborate forms of the signal. However; whether these signals convey reliable informationabout the physiology underlying trait development remains unknown in many species. Thesteroid hormone corticosterone (CORT) mediates important physiological and behavioralprocesses during the vertebrate stress response; and CORT secretion itself can bemodulated by melanocortins. Thus; sexually selected melanin-based plumage colorationcould function as an honest signal of an individual's ability to respond to stressors. Thishypothesis was tested in North American barn swallows; Hirundo rustica erythrogaster;where males with darker ventral plumage color exhibit higher phaeomelanin content andare more successful at reproduction. Because reproductive behavior occurs months after …,Hormones and behavior,2013,22
An integrative view of the signaling phenotype: Dynamic links between signals; physiology; behavior and social context,Maren N VITOUSEK; David M ZONANA; Rebecca J SAFRAN,Abstract Signal traits are often linked with the physiological state and behavior of theirbearer. Direct examination of the causal links among these variables has providedsubstantial insight into the information content of signals; and into the costs and benefits ofsignal expression. Yet recent empirical work suggests that the social context in whichsignals are developed and displayed can play a major role not only in how signals arereceived; but also in coordinating and mediating the signaling phenotype itself.

A robust new metric of phenotypic distance to estimate and compare multiple trait differences among populations,Rebecca Safran; Samuel Flaxman; Michael Kopp; Darren E Irwin; Derek Briggs; Matthew R Evans; W Chris Funk; David A Gray; Eileen A Hebets; Nathalie Seddon; Elizabeth Scordato; Laurel B Symes; Joseph A Tobias; David PL Toews; J Albert C Uy,Abstract Whereas a rich literature exists for estimating population genetic divergence;metrics of phenotypic trait divergence are lacking; particularly for comparing multiple traitsamong three or more populations. Here; we review and analyze via simulation Hedges'g; awidely used parametric estimate of effect size. Our analyses indicate that g is sensitive to acombination of unequal trait variances and unequal sample sizes among populations and tochanges in the scale of measurement. We then go on to derive and explain a new; non-parametric distance measure;“Δ p”; which is calculated based upon a joint cumulativedistribution function (CDF) from all populations under study. More precisely; distances aremeasured in terms of the percentiles in this CDF at which each population's median lies. Δ pcombines many desirable features of other distance metrics into a single metric; namely …,Current Zoology,2012,18
Egg‐yolk androgen and carotenoid deposition as a function of maternal social environment in barn swallows Hirundo rustica,Rebecca J Safran; Kevin J McGraw; Kevin M Pilz; Stephanie M Correa,Abstract Evidence is mounting that female animals use egg-yolk compounds (eg steroids;antioxidants) to adaptively engineer the quality of their offspring as a function of severalmaternal and environmental factors. Though adjustments to yolk allocation have been well-characterized as a function of parental phenotypes; we know very little about how anindividual's social environment influences yolk composition. Here; we consider how twotypes of yolk compounds; androgens and carotenoids; relate to the maternal socialenvironment during the egg-laying period; controlling statistically for known correlationsbetween various aspects of parental quality and egg yolk compounds.

Multimodal signalling in the North American barn swallow: a phenotype network approach,Matthew R Wilkins; Daizaburo Shizuka; Maxwell B Joseph; Joanna K Hubbard; Rebecca J Safran,Complex signals; involving multiple components within and across modalities; are commonin animal communication. However; decomposing complex signals into traits and theirinteractions remains a fundamental challenge for studies of phenotype evolution. We applya novel phenotype network approach for studying complex signal evolution in the NorthAmerican barn swallow (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster). We integrate model testing withcorrelation-based phenotype networks to infer the contributions of female mate choice andmale–male competition to the evolution of barn swallow communication. Overall; the bestpredictors of mate choice were distinct from those for competition; while moderate functionaloverlap suggests males and females use some of the same traits to assess potential matesand rivals. We interpret model results in the context of a network of traits; and suggest this …,Proc. R. Soc. B,2015,17
Settlement patterns of female barn swallows Hirundo rustica across different group sizes: access to colorful males or favored nests?,Rebecca J Safran,Abstract In most avian species; individuals are faced with two critical decisions at the start ofa breeding season: choosing a breeding site and a mate. An analysis of these decisions inlight of population-level patterns; such as group size variation in social breeders; canilluminate the causes and patterns of habitat selection behavior. Group sizes are variable inbarn swallows; however; no clear and consistent benefits of group breeding have beenfound in this species; and it is puzzling as to why individuals breed socially. Previousanalyses demonstrated that individuals aggregate to gain access to nests that wereconstructed during previous seasons; however extra-pair matings are also prevalent in thisspecies; raising questions about the mate-selection strategies of females across differentgroup sizes. In this paper; I address the question of how females make their first site …,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,2007,17
Quantitative genetics of plumage color: lifetime effects of early nest environment on a colorful sexual signal,Joanna K Hubbard; Brittany R Jenkins; Rebecca J Safran,Abstract Phenotypic differences among individuals are often linked to differential survivaland mating success. Quantifying the relative influence of genetic and environmentalvariation on phenotype allows evolutionary biologists to make predictions about thepotential for a given trait to respond to selection and various aspects of environmentalvariation. In particular; the environment individuals experience during early developmentcan have lasting effects on phenotype later in life. Here; we used a natural full-sib/half-sibdesign as well as within-individual longitudinal analyses to examine genetic and variousenvironmental influences on plumage color. We find that variation in melanin-basedplumage color–a trait known to influence mating success in adult North American barnswallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster)–is influenced by both genetics and aspects of …,Ecology and Evolution,2015,16

However; only limited data exist concerning thistransition and the factors promoting it. Here; we study phases of speciation using data from>100 populations of 11 species of Timema stick insects. Consistent with early phases of genicspeciation; adaptive colour-pattern loci reside in localized genetic regions of accentuateddifferentiation between populations experiencing gene flow. Transitions to genome-widedifferentiation are also observed with gene flow; in association with differentiation inpolygenic chemical traits affecting mate choice. Thus; intermediate phases of speciation areassociated with genome-wide differentiation and mate choice; but not growth of a fewgenomic islands. We also find a gap in genomic differentiation between sympatric taxa …,Nature ecology & evolution,2017,14
How acoustic signals scale with individual body size: common trends across diverse taxa,Rafael L Rodríguez; Marcelo Araya-Salas; David A Gray; Michael S Reichert; Laurel B Symes; Matthew R Wilkins; Rebecca J Safran; Gerlinde Höbel,Abstract We use allometric analysis to explore how acoustic signals scale on individual bodysize and to test hypotheses about the factors shaping relationships between signals andbody size. Across case studies spanning birds; crickets; tree crickets; and tree frogs; we findthat most signal traits had low coefficients of variation; shallow allometric scalings; and littledispersion around the allometric function. We relate variation in these measures to theshape of mate preferences and the level of condition dependence of signal traits. We find 3major patterns: 1) signal traits associated with closed mate preferences had lowercoefficients of variation and shallower allometries than signal traits with open preferences; 2)signal traits with higher levels of condition dependence had higher coefficients of variationand steeper allometries; and 3) the relationship between condition dependence and …,Behavioral Ecology,2014,13
Performance of Encounternet Tags: Field Tests of Miniaturized Proximity Loggers for Use on Small Birds,Iris I Levin; David M Zonana; John M Burt; Rebecca J Safran,Proximity logging is a new tool for understanding social behavior as it allows for accuratequantification of social networks. We report results from field calibration and deploymenttests of miniaturized proximity tags (Encounternet); digital transceivers that log encountersbetween tagged individuals. We examined radio signal behavior in relation to tagattachment (tag; tag on bird; tag on saline-filled balloon) to understand how radio signalstrength is affected by the tag mounting technique used for calibration tests. We investigatedinter-tag and inter-receiver station variability; and in each calibration test we accounted forthe effects of antennae orientation. Additionally; we used data from a live deployment onbreeding barn swallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster) to analyze the quality of the logs;including reciprocal agreement in dyadic logs. We evaluated the impact (in terms of mass …,PloS one,2015,11
Population genetics of a recent transcontinental colonization of South America by breeding Barn Swallows (Hirundo rustica),Shawn M Billerman; Gernot H Huber; David W Winkler; Rebecca J Safran; Irby J Lovette,abstract. The natural range extension and colonization of a new continent by a bird speciesis rare; and even more rarely is it observed and documented. In 1980; six pairs of BarnSwallows were found breeding in Argentina within the species' historical wintering range;and this South American population has since grown to thousands of pairs. We explored thegenetic context and consequences of this natural trans-hemispheric colonization event viacomparisons among the South American population and two North American populations.We tested for evidence of a genetic founder event by assessing allelic diversity at eightmicrosatellite loci and haplotype diversity of mitochondrial ND2 sequences. Contrary to ourexpectations; the recently established South American breeding population showed noevidence of a founder effect; with no difference in heterozygosity; allelic diversity …,The Auk,2011,11

IBA can becomplementary to the well-known pattern of 'isolation by distance'(IBD); in which thedivergence of closely related populations (via any evolutionary process) is associated withgeographic isolation. The barn swallow Hirundo rustica complex comprises six closelyrelated subspecies; where divergent sexual selection is associated with phenotypicdifferentiation among allopatric populations. To investigate the relative contributions ofselection and geographic distance to genome-wide differentiation; we compared genotypicand phenotypic variation from 350 barn swallows sampled across eight populations (28 …,Molecular Ecology,2016,10
Conceptual Revision and Synthesis of Proximate Factors Associated with Age‐Related Improvement in Reproduction,Rachel J Bradley; Rebecca J Safran,Abstract Improvement in reproductive performance with age; up to the point of senescence;is a predominant pattern among vertebrates. Predictions from life-history theory provide apowerful framework for understanding the evolutionary basis of these patterns. However;based on the growing number of publications on this topic; there is increased interest inunderstanding the proximate causes of age-related improvements in reproductiveperformance (ARIRP). A formal conceptual framework through which factors related toARIRP can be examined is lacking. Here; we establish hypotheses with testable predictionsfor social and ecological factors; including resource quality; mate fidelity; site fidelity; priorbreeding experience; and changes in ability to attract mates. We use this conceptualframework to review 55 empirical studies published (between 1900 through 2013) on …,Ethology,2014,10

Stress response; gut microbial diversity and sexual signals correlate with social interactions,Iris I Levin; David M Zonana; Bailey K Fosdick; Se Jin Song; Rob Knight; Rebecca J Safran,Theory predicts that social interactions are dynamically linked to phenotype. Yet becausesocial interactions are difficult to quantify; little is known about the precise details on howinteractivity is linked to phenotype. Here; we deployed proximity loggers on North Americanbarn swallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster) to examine intercorrelations among socialinteractions; morphology and features of the phenotype that are sensitive to the socialcontext: stress-induced corticosterone (CORT) and gut microbial diversity. We analysedrelationships at two spatial scales of interaction:(i) body contact and (ii) social interactionsoccurring between 0.1 and 5 m. Network analysis revealed that relationships between socialinteractions; morphology; CORT and gut microbial diversity varied depending on the sexesof the individuals interacting and the spatial scale of interaction proximity.

Evolutionary biology: arms races in the eye of the beholder,Rebecca J Safran; Maren N Vitousek,To the human eye; the eggs of brood parasitic birds; including many cuckoos; look to match thecolours of their hosts remarkably. Yet some but not all species parasitized by cuckoos and otherbrood parasites are able to spot and reject the odd one among the crowd. The European cuckoo(Cuculus canorus) presents a special challenge for researchers as selection for the recognitionof their eggs by hosts — who lose all of their own offspring to this parasite — should be particularlystrong; but acceptance of cuckoo eggs is perplexingly common [1;2]. Perhaps the most fascinatingaspect of this arms race between European cuckoos and their hosts is that individual femalesbelonging to different races of this parasite specialize on one or a few of the host species; anddo so by laying eggs that; to the human observer; match the particular host egg to near perfection(Figure 1). But how good is this match; really; when viewed by the host itself; and why …,Current Biology,2008,9
The maintenance of phenotypic divergence through sexual selection: An experimental study in barn swallows Hirundo rustica,Rebecca J Safran; Yoni Vortman; Brittany R Jenkins; Joanna K Hubbard; Matthew R Wilkins; Rachel J Bradley; Arnon Lotem,Abstract Previous studies have shown that sexual signals can rapidly diverge among closelyrelated species. However; we lack experimental studies to demonstrate that differences intrait-associated reproductive performance maintain sexual trait differences between closelyrelated populations; in support for a role of sexual selection in speciation. Populations ofNorthern Hemisphere distributed barn swallows Hirundo rustica are closely related; yet differin two plumage-based traits: ventral color and length of the outermost tail feathers(streamers). Here we provide experimental evidence that manipulations of these traits resultin different reproductive consequences in two subspecies of barn swallow:(H. r.erythrogaster in North America and H. r. transitiva in the East Mediterranean). Experimentalresults in Colorado; USA; demonstrate that males with (1) darkened ventral coloration …,Evolution,2016,8
Comparative analysis reveals migratory swallows (Hirundinidae) have less pointed wings than residents,Gernot H Huber; Sheela P Turbek; Kimberly S Bostwick; Rebecca J Safran,Abstract The correlation between migration and wing pointedness; a pattern generallyattributed to the need to reduce drag during powered straight-line flight; is well establishedin avian ecomorphology. However; most studies investigating this pattern have focused onrelatively rounded-wing taxa; which employ different flight modes during foraging andmigration. The basic assumption that migrants have comparatively pointed wings has notbeen questioned by analysing taxa with similar migratory and foraging flight. This studyexamines the correlation between migration and wing shape in swallows (Hirundinidae); afamily with relatively pointed wings in which foraging flight resembles migratory flight. Usinga phylogeny-based analysis; we compare the wing shape of species pairs with varyingmigratory habits in eight swallow genera. Surprisingly; migratory swallows have less …,Biological Journal of the Linnean Society,2016,8
Expression of multiple sexual signals by fathers and sons in the East-mediterranean barn swallow: are advertising strategies heritable?,Yoni Vortman; Rebecca J Safran; Tali Reiner Brodetzki; Roi Dor; Arnon Lotem,The level of expression of sexually selected traits is generally determined by genes;environment and their interaction. In species that use multiple sexual signals which may becostly to produce; investing in the expression of one sexual signal may limit the expressionof the other; favoring the evolution of a strategy for resource allocation among signals. As aresult; even when the expression of sexual signals is condition dependent; the relative levelof expression of each signal may be heritable. We tested this hypothesis in the East-Mediterranean barn swallow (Hirundo rustica transitiva); in which males have been shownto express two uncorrelated sexual signals: red-brown ventral coloration; and long tailstreamers. We show that variation in both signals may partially be explained by age; as wellas by paternal origin (genetic father-son regressions); but that the strongest similarity …,PloS one,2015,7

Phenotypic differentiation is associated with divergent sexual selection among closely related barn swallow populations,Matthew R Wilkins; Hakan Karaardıç; Yoni Vortman; Thomas L Parchman; Tomáš Albrecht; Adéla Petrželková; Leyla Özkan; PL Pap; Joanna K Hubbard; Amanda K Hund; Rebecca J Safran,Abstract Sexual selection plays a key role in the diversification of numerous animal cladesand may accelerate trait divergence during speciation. However; much of our understandingof this process comes from phylogenetic comparative studies; which rely on surrogatemeasures such as dimorphism that may not represent selection in wild populations. In thisstudy; we assess sexual selection pressures for multiple male visual signals across fourbarn swallow (Hirundo rustica) populations. Our sample encompassed 2400 linear km andtwo described subspecies: European H. r. rustica (in the Czech Republic and Romania) andeastern Mediterranean H. r. transitiva (in Israel); as well as a potential area of contact (inTurkey). We demonstrate significant phenotypic differentiation in four sexual signalling axes;despite very low-level genomic divergence and no comparable divergence in an …,Journal of Evolutionary Biology,2016,6
Parents respond in sex-specific and dynamic ways to nestling ectoparasites,Amanda K Hund; Matthew A Aberle; Rebecca J Safran,Nest ectoparasites can impose significant costs to altricial nestlings that are confined to thenest and dependent on parental care. These costs are often passed on to parents who maycompensate for; or magnify; the direct costs of parasites on their nestlings throughadjustments in parental care behaviour. If the effects of ectoparasites on nestlings varyacross development; parents would be expected to dynamically adjust their behaviouracross time with the possibility that males and females may vary in their responses.Currently; we lack a complete understanding of the potential sex differences and variation inparental care behaviour across the nestling period as a function of offspring parasiteinfection. Our experimental study compared disinfected and parasitized treatment groups toexamine how northern fowl mites; Ornithonyssus sylviarum; in nests of the North …,Animal Behaviour,2015,6
Quantitative color variation within and across morphs of the polymorphic White-throated Sparrow,Nathan A Rathbun; Andrea S Grunst; Melissa L Grunst; Joanna K Hubbard; Rebecca J Safran; Rusty A Gonser; Elaina M Tuttle,ABSTRACT Coloration has evolved to serve diverse functions; including communication. Inspecies with discrete color polymorphisms; the extent to which color variation exists withinmorphs and communicates multiple messages often remains unclear. We employedreflectance spectrometry to study variation in coloration in the dimorphic White-throatedSparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis); which exhibits a “white” and “tan” morph in both sexes. Weexplored whether distinct color traits distinguish between morph and sex classes; andwhether color variation exists within classes that might reflect differences in individualquality. Further; we asked whether sexual dichromatism is more pronounced in the whitemorph; in which males display greater promiscuity and aggression and; thus; may be understronger sexual selection for conspicuous coloration.

Patterns and ecological predictors of age-related performance in female North American barn swallows; Hirundo rustica erythrogaster,RJ Bradley; JK Hubbard; BR Jenkins; RJ Safran,Abstract Life history theory describes the optimization of important trade-offs within anindividual's lifetime and predicts that an individual's reproductive performance (RP) willimprove up until a point of senescence. Despite abundant evidence for this pattern; relativelyfew studies consider the mechanisms associated with age-related improvements in RP. Inthis study; we aimed to describe patterns of age-related RP (seasonal fledgling production)in female North American barn swallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster) using a longitudinaldata set to test multiple hypotheses about the social; morphological; and ecological factorsunderlying this prominent life history pattern. To address these objectives; we usedgeneralized linear mixed models in a three-step series of analyses in which we assessed (1)patterns of female age-related RP;(2) the influence of age on changes in social …,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,2014,5
Sexual Signaling: Climatic Carry-Over,Maren N Vitousek; Roi Dor; Rebecca J Safran,Sexual signals are widely used to convey information about their bearer to potential mates orcompetitors [1]. These signals are often condition-dependent; providing information about anindividual's ability to withstand environmental challenges [2]. Current climate influences bothcondition and signal development; but until recently; little was known about whether signals reflectedtheir bearer's ability to cope with prior environmental challenges [3;4]. Carry-over events — whichoccur in one season but influence success during subsequent seasons — have been demonstratedin a variety of species [5] and could have major influences on reproductive success in a rapidlychanging climate. For example; when more of the non-breeding habitat of grey whales is coveredby ice; females are in lower condition during the following breeding season; and produce fewercalves [6]. Such carry-over effects could be particularly influential for organisms that …,Current Biology,2012,5
Behavioural ecology: Promiscuous fathers sire young that recognize true family,Mark E Hauber; Rebecca J Safran,Most theories of kin selection assume that animals are able to distinguish relatives from non-relatives. This is especially difficult in situations where mixed parentage precludes thatrelatedness is recognised by familiarity. Recent work shows that; within the same brood;young bluegill sunfish that are fathered by cuckolders—but not those sired by parentalmales—pick out their relatives using self-referent phenotype matching and not familiarity.,Current biology,2006,5

The loss of telomeres can signal an irreversible change to a cell9s state;including cellular senescence. Senescent cells no longer divide and can damage nearbyhealthy cells; thus potentially placing them at the crossroads of cancer and ageing. While theepidemiology; cellular and molecular biology of telomeres are well studied; a newer fieldexploring telomere biology in the context of ecology and evolution is just emerging. Withwork to date focusing on how telomere shortening relates to individual mortality; less isknown about how telomeres relate to ageing rates across species.

Mechanisms of Assortative Mating in Speciation with Gene Flow: Connecting Theory and Empirical Research,Michael Kopp; Maria R Servedio; Tamra C Mendelson; Rebecca J Safran; Rafael L Rodríguez; Mark E Hauber; Elizabeth C Scordato; Laurel B Symes; Christopher N Balakrishnan; David M Zonana; G Sander van Doorn,Abstract The large body of theory on speciation with gene flow has brought to lightfundamental differences in the effects of two types of mating rules on speciation:preference/trait rules; in which divergence in both (female) preferences and (male) matingtraits is necessary for assortment; and matching rules; in which individuals mate with likeindividuals on the basis of the presence of traits or alleles that they have in common. Theserules can emerge from a variety of behavioral or other mechanisms in ways that are notalways obvious. We discuss the theoretical properties of both types of rules and explain whyspeciation is generally thought to be more likely under matching rather than preference/traitrules. We furthermore discuss whether specific assortative mating mechanisms fall under apreference/trait or matching rule; present empirical evidence for these mechanisms; and …,The American Naturalist,2018,4
Cognitive Phenotypes and the Evolution of Animal Decisions,Tamra C Mendelson; Courtney L Fitzpatrick; Mark E Hauber; Charles H Pence; Rafael L Rodríguez; Rebecca J Safran; Caitlin A Stern; Jeffrey R Stevens,Despite the clear fitness consequences of animal decisions; the science of animal decisionmaking in evolutionary biology is underdeveloped compared with decision science inhuman psychology. Specifically; the field lacks a conceptual framework that defines anddescribes the relevant components of a decision; leading to imprecise language andconcepts. The 'judgment and decision-making'(JDM) framework in human psychology is apowerful tool for framing and understanding human decisions; and we apply it here tocomponents of animal decisions; which we refer to as 'cognitive phenotypes'. We distinguishmultiple cognitive phenotypes in the context of a JDM framework and highlight empiricalapproaches to characterize them as evolvable traits.,Trends in Ecology & Evolution,2016,4
Signal Traits and Oxidative Stress: A Comparative Study Across Populations with Divergent Signals,Maren N Vitousek; Oldřich Tomášek; Tomas Albrecht; Matthew R Wilkins; Rebecca J Safran,Diverging populations often shift patterns of signal use–a process that can contribute toreproductive isolation and speciation. Yet it is not clear why most traits gain or lose signalvalue during divergence. One reason this could occur is because changes in therelationship between signals and relevant physiological parameters degrade the reliabilityof a signal; or even change its underlying information content. Here we test the hypothesisthat the relationship between signal trait elaboration and a central component of organismalhealth–oxidative stress–differs across closely related populations that have diverged insignal use and preferences. In the recently diverged barn swallow subspecies complex(Hirundo rustica; Family: Hirundinidae); different populations use different traits as sexualsignals. Two of these traits; ventral breast plumage color and tail streamer length; differ …,Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,2016,4
Piecing together female extra‐pair mate choice: females really do prefer more ornamented males,Sarah J Wells; Rebecca J Safran; James Dale,Abstract Evolutionary biologists have long been fascinated by extravagant male traits thatabound across the animal kingdom and yet convey no apparent benefits to survival. Fromisopods to elephants; from armaments to ornaments; researchers have spent decadesstudying male–male competition and female mate choice in an effort to understand thesignificance of these secondary sexual characteristics. Among socially monogamousspecies; a frequently proposed explanation for the existence of male ornaments is that theyare indicators of male genetic quality subject to female extra-pair mate choice. However;despite over two decades of extensive research into extra-pair paternity (EPP); the evidencethat females actually choose more ornamented extra-pair sires is surprisingly scant.Consequently; whether EPP and female choice have contributed to the evolution of male …,Molecular Ecology,2016,3

Genomic variation across two barn swallow hybrid zones reveals traits associated with divergence in sympatry and allopatry,Elizabeth SC Scordato; Matthew R Wilkins; Georgy Semenov; Alexander S Rubtsov; Nolan C Kane; Rebecca J Safran,Abstract Hybrid zones are geographic regions where isolating barriers between divergentpopulations are challenged by admixture. Identifying factors that facilitate or inhibithybridization in sympatry can illuminate the processes that maintain those reproductivebarriers. We analyzed patterns of hybridization and phenotypic variation across two newly-discovered hybrid zones between three subspecies of barn swallow (Hirundo rustica).These subspecies differ in ventral coloration and wing length; traits that are targets of sexualand natural selection; respectively; and are associated with genome-wide differentiation inallopatry. We tested the hypothesis that the degree of divergence in these traits is associatedwith the extent of hybridization in secondary contact. We applied measures of populationstructure based on> 23;000 SNPs to confirm that named subspecies correspond to …,Molecular Ecology,2017,2

Evolutionary biology: Variation isn't always sexy,Rebecca J Safran; Mark E Hauber,The trouble with Darwinian sexual selection is that it appears to contradict predictions of Darwiniannatural selection: sexually selected traits are considered to be costly; while naturally selectedtraits are considered to be beneficial in terms of survival-related fitness [1;2]. Both are predictedto increase the lifetime reproductive success of individuals. Traditional approaches in evolutionarybiology have assumed that sexual selection operates on most traits that are sexually dimorphicand that reduce the foraging or survival success of its bearers (reviewed in [3]). Thus; sex differencesof an ornamental trait must be under sexual selection and convey information to potential matesand competitors in the population about the individual's quality; status; and fighting ability.Yet; until a study reported in this issue of Current Biology[4]; the assumption about sexual selectionbeing the primary mechanism underlying variation between individuals in ornamental …,Current biology,2007,2

Effects of assortative mate choice on the genomic and morphological structure of a hybrid zone between two bird subspecies,Georgy A Semenov; Elizabeth SC Scordato; David R Khaydarov; Chris CR Smith; Nolan C Kane; Rebecca J Safran,Abstract Phenotypic differentiation plays an important role in the formation and maintenanceof reproductive barriers. In some cases; variation in a few key aspects of phenotype canpromote and maintain divergence; hence; the identification of these traits and theirassociations with patterns of genomic divergence is crucial for understanding the patternsand processes of population differentiation.

Impact of pre-lab learning activities; a post-lab written report; and content reduction on evolution-based learning in an undergraduate plant biodiversity lab,John M Basey; Anastasia P Maines; Clinton D Francis; Brett Melbourne; Sarah B Wise; Rebecca J Safran; Pieter TJ Johnson,Commonplace biodiversity labs in introductory undergraduate biology typically emphasizedeclarative knowledge. We contend that shifting these labs to emphasize evolution; higher-order cognition; and science reasoning would benefit student learning. Four factors thatlikely make evolution-based higher-order learning goals difficult to achieve in these labs are:the novelty and quantity of required declarative knowledge; the number of integratedconcepts; the theoretical nature of evolution; and limitations on working memory. Thus; wepropose that a model to shift learning from lower-order declarative knowledge to evolution-based higher-order integration in these labs would reduce overall lower-order content;increase time efficiency through hands-on pre-lab activities; and increase evidence-basedreasoning through written post-labs that emphasize evolution-based higher-order …,Evolution: Education and Outreach,2014,1
Waterbird responses to experimental drawdown,ORIANE W TAFT; MARK A COLWELL; CRAIG R ISOLA; REBECCA J SAFRAN,Summary 1. The loss and human modification of wetlands world-wide underscores theimportance of efficient management. For wetlands that provide habitats for non-breedingwaterbirds; such management often aims to support a rich and abundant waterbirdcommunity. 2. Among the world's many seasonal; moist-soil managed wetlands; annualwinter flooding is followed by spring drawdown to encourage germination of waterfowl foodplants. Recommendations on how best to maintain flooded wetlands for multiple species aremostly theoretical; and drawdown management typically focuses on spring for migratingshorebirds. The benefits and drawbacks of shallow-water management in winter have notbeen examined; especially where sizeable populations of wintering shorebirds andwaterfowl occur together.,Journal of Applied Ecology,2002,1
Predictors and consequences of nest-switching behavior in Barn Swallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster),Kyle J Donahue; Amanda K Hund; Iris I Levin; Rebecca J Safran,ABSTRACT Nest-switching is an important breeding strategy for multiple-brooded birdspecies. When deciding whether or not to switch nests for subsequent breeding attempts;pairs must weigh the costs and benefits of various factors related to the number of fledglingsof the first breeding attempt; the likelihood of nest predation; and qualities of the nestenvironment; such as nest ectoparasites and the age of the nest. In this study; we analyzedthe predictors and consequences of nest-switching behavior at 6 breeding sites of NorthAmerican Barn Swallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster); where 60% of pairs that raised 2broods within a season switched nests for a second breeding attempt. Pairs often reusedexisting (old) nests constructed during previous years; and pairs that settled in old nests fortheir first breeding attempt were the most likely to switch nests for a second breeding …,The Auk,2018,*

An experimental test of the effect of brood size on glucocorticoid responses; parental investment; and offspring phenotype,Maren N Vitousek; Brittany R Jenkins; Joanna K Hubbard; Sara A Kaiser; Rebecca J Safran,Abstract Because elevated glucocorticoid levels can impair reproduction; populations orspecies that engage in particularly valuable reproductive attempts may down-regulate theglucocorticoid stress response during reproduction (the brood value hypothesis). It is notclear; however; whether individuals rapidly modulate glucocorticoid responses based onshifting cues about the likelihood of reproductive success. By manipulating brood size tocreate broods that differed in potential value; we tested whether female barn swallows(Hirundo rustica) rapidly modulated the glucocorticoid stress response to promoteinvestment in high-value broods; and whether nestling phenotype was influenced bytreatment. Within-individual changes in female corticosterone; body mass; and measures ofoxidative stress were unrelated to brood size treatment.

Disruptive selection on plumage coloration across genetically determined morphs,Andrea S Grunst; Melissa L Grunst; Nathan A Rathbun; Joanna K Hubbard; Rebecca J Safran; Rusty A Gonser; Elaina M Tuttle,Sexual selection can drive the evolution of conspicuous visual signals that advertiseindividual quality to prospective mates. Reproductive strategy can influence the balancebetween selective pressures and whether sexually selected signals evolve. Alternatively;visual signals can serve other functions; including predator deterrence; species recognitionand differentiating genetically determined morphs. In the dimorphic white-throated sparrow;Zonotrichia albicollis; we explored how selection on conspicuous coloration changes withreproductive strategy; and whether visual signals of morph identity are discrete from sexuallyselected signals of individual quality. In this species; white morph birds have more colourfulplumage than tan morph birds; and white males are more promiscuous and aggressive thantan counterparts. White females are also more aggressive than tan females. White males …,Animal Behaviour,2017,*
Setting a gold standard for integrative evolutionary biology,Rebecca J Safran,Junco. University of Chicago Press; Chicago; Illinois. 416 pp. ISBN 9780226330808; $60CB. Longitudinal studies of organisms in the wild are the gold standard for understandingthe complexity and dynamics of the evolutionary process. Still; data from long-term fieldstudies are rare and hold a special place in the literature. The Snowbird is an edited volumeby Ellen Ketterson and Jonathan Atwell focused on a songbird that has become a workhorsefor integrative longterm research: the dark-eyed junco. As the title indicates; the snowbird; orjunco; is front and center of this compilation; which documents research that began in theearly 1900s. However; this book is much more than an exploration of a particular bird: it is anauthoritative example of how to do integrative biology thoroughly; and thoroughly well. Thisbook is a compilation of 14 chapters that are organized into four parts. Along with a very …,*,2017,*
Evolutionary Genetics: Small Genomic Regions Make a Big Impact,Elizabeth SC Scordato; Rebecca J Safran,Identifying the genes underlying ecologically and behaviorally important phenotypes in naturalpopulations has long been a holy grail for evolutionary biologists. Despite a few early successstories; many involving genes in the melanocortin pathway that affect animal coloration [1]; findingsuch genes has remained difficult [2]. However; the genomic revolution has led to the discoveryof genes; or genomic regions; that underlie phenotypic variation. A particularly promising approachfor identifying these genomic regions is the study of hybrid zones between species where recombinationfacilitates genetic mapping of phenotypes [3]. Two papers published recently in Current Biologyby Toews; Taylor et al.[4] and Delmore et al.[5] investigate hybrid zones between bird speciesand add to an emerging picture of the genomic architecture of hybridization and divergence.Although the systems are different; both studies converge on similar results: a small …,Current Biology,2016,*
The importance of cross-validation; accuracy; and precision for measuring plumage color: A comment on Vaquero-Alba et al.(2016),Joanna K Hubbard; Amanda K Hund; Iris I Levin; Kevin J McGraw; Matthew R Wilkins; Rebecca J Safran,ABSTRACT Vaquero-Alba and colleagues published a study in The Auk: OrnithologicalAdvances comparing objective color measurements of plumage taken in the field directly ona bird's body to those taken in the lab on collected feathers arranged to emulate theappearance of a bird's natural plumage. Although the field measures of plumage color wereless repeatable than lab measures; the authors concluded that measurements taken in thefield were more representative of a bird's “true color.” Accordingly; they recommend thatresearchers should bring spectrophotometers into the field to measure color on live birds.We question the assumption that their field measurements represent true color and highlightconcerns regarding their experimental design and methodology. Because they did notmeasure color of live birds in the lab or the color of plucked feathers in the field; they …,The Auk,2016,*

An experimental analysis of the heritability of variation in,Brittany R Jenkins; Maren N Vitousek; Joanna K Hubbard; Rebecca J Safran,Glucocorticoid hormones (CORT) are predicted to promote adaptation to variableenvironments; yet little is known about the potential for CORT secretion patterns to respondto selection in free-living populations. We assessed the heritable variation underlyingdifferences in hormonal phenotypes using a cross-foster experimental design with nestlingNorth American barn swallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster). Using a bivariate animalmodel; we partitioned variance in baseline and stress-induced CORT concentrations intotheir additive genetic and rearing environment components and estimated their geneticcorrelation. Both baseline and stress-induced CORT were heritable with heritability of 0.152and 0.343; respectively. We found that the variation in baseline CORT was best explainedby rearing environment; whereas the variation in stress-induced CORT was contributed to …,*,2014,*

Female ornamentation predicts yolk antioxidant levels in striped plateau lizards; Sceloporus virgatus,Stacey Weiss; EA Kennedy; RJ Safran; KJ McGraw,Abstract Maternal investment in egg quality can have important consequences for offspringfitness. For example; yolk antioxidants can affect embryonic development as well as juvenileand adult phenotype. Thus; females may be selected to advertise their yolk antioxidantdeposition to discriminatory males via ornamental signals; perhaps depending on thereproductive costs associated with signal production. 2. Female striped plateau lizards(Sceloporus virgatus) develop pterin-based orange colour patches during the reproductiveseason that influence male behaviour and that are positively associated with the phenotypicquality of the female and her offspring. Here; we assessed one potential developmentalmechanism underlying the relationship between offspring quality and female ornamentationin S. virgatus; by examining the relationship between ornament expression and yolk …,The Journal of animal ecology,2011,*

Population Genetic Consequences of Different Dispersal-Distance Distributions in a Continuous Landscape,N Tisch; DS Goldberg; DE Hiebler; GL Hume; CE McCulloch; RJ Safran; LM Stenzler; NM Sundell; DW Winkler,Abstract Dispersal is a pervasive life history trait; yet there is relatively little understanding ofthe evolutionary forces affecting variation in dispersal distances or the consequences of thatvariation. In natural populations; the effects of dispersal are often confounded by otherfactors including local selection or population history. To isolate the population geneticeffects of different dispersal distributions in continuous space; modeling approaches must beused. We developed a cellular automata model and used it to quantify spatial geneticvariation for 18 different dispersal distance distributions. We developed and used a measureof spatial autocovariance to quantify the population genetic consequences of dispersal. Wefound that population genetic structure is persistent (for thousands of generations) and thatlandscape size and initial distribution of individuals may affect the genetic structure by …,*,2000,*
