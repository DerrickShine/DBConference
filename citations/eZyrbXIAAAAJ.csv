On the generation of spatiotemporal datasets,Yannis Theodoridis; Jefferson RO Silva; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract An efficient benchmarking environment for spatiotemporal access methods shouldat least include modules for generating synthetic datasets; storing datasets (real datasetsincluded); collecting and running access structures; and visualizing experimental results.Focusing on the dataset repository module; a collection of synthetic data that would simulatea variety of real life scenarios is required. Several algorithms have been implemented in thepast to generate static spatial (point or rectangular) data; for instance; following a predefineddistribution in the workspace. However; by introducing motion; and thus temporal evolutionin spatial object definition; generating synthetic data tends to be a complex problem. In thispaper; we discuss the parameters to be considered by a generator for such type of data;propose an algorithm; called “Generate_Spatio_Temporal_Data”(GSTD); which …,International Symposium on Spatial Databases,1999,383
Towards historical R-trees,Mario A Nascimento; Jefferson RO Silva,ABSTRACT R-trees are the" de facto" reference structures for indexing spatial data; namelythe minumum bounding rectangles (MBRs) of spatial objects. However; R-trees; as currentlyknown; do not support the evohition of such MBRs. Whenever an MBR evolves; its newversion replaces the old one; which is therefore lost. Thus; an R-tree always shows thecurrent state of the data set; not allowing the user to query the spatial database with respectto past states. In this paper we extend the R-tree in such a way that old states are preserved;allowing the user to query them. The proposed approach does not duplicate nodes whichwere not modified; thus saving considerable storage space. On the other hand; the queryprocessing time does not depend on the number of past states stored.,Proceedings of the 1998 ACM symposium on Applied Computing,1998,319
A compact and efficient image retrieval approach based on border/interior pixel classification,Renato O Stehling; Mario A Nascimento; Alexandre X Falcão,Abstract This paper presents\bic (Border/Interior pixel Classification); a compact and efficientCBIR approach suitable for broad image domains. It has three main components:(1) asimple and powerful image analysis algorithm that classifies image pixels as either border orinterior;(2) a new logarithmic distance (dLog) for comparing histograms; and (3) a compactrepresentation for the visual features extracted from images. Experimental results show thatthe BIC approach is consistently more compact; more efficient and more effective than state-of-the-art CBIR approaches based on sophisticated image analysis algorithms and complexdistance functions. It was also observed that the dLog distance function has two mainadvantages over vectorial distances (eg; L 1):(1) it is able to increase substantially theeffectiveness of (several) histogram-based CBIR approaches and; at the same time;(2) it …,Proceedings of the eleventh international conference on Information and knowledge management,2002,316
Spade: On shape-based pattern detection in streaming time series,Yueguo Chen; Mario A Nascimento; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony KH Tung,Monitoring predefined patterns in streaming time series is useful to applications such astrend-related analysis; sensor networks and video surveillance. Most current studies on suchmonitoring employ Euclidean distance to calculate the similarities between given querypatterns and subsequences of streaming time series. Euclidean distance has been shown tobe ineffective in measuring distances of time series in which shifting and scaling usuallyexist. Consequently; warping distances such as dynamic time warping (DTW); longestcommon subsequence (LCSS); have been proposed to handle warps in temporaldimension. However; they are inadequate in handling shifting and scaling in amplitudedimension. Moreover; they have been designed mainly for full sequence matching; whereasin online monitoring applications; we typically have no knowledge on the positions and …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007.

Evaluation of access structures for discretely moving points,Mario A Nascimento; Jefferson RO Silva; Yannis Theodoridis,Abstract Several applications require management of data which is spatially dynamic; eg;tracking of battle ships or moving cells in a blood sample. The capability of handling thetemporal aspect; ie; the history of such type of data; is also important. This paper presentsand evaluates three temporal extensions of the R-tree; the 3D R-tree; the 2+ 3 R-tree andthe HR-tree; which are capable of indexing spatiotemporal data. Our experiments focus ondiscretely moving points (ie; points standing at a specific location for a time period and thenmoving “instantaneously”; and so on and so forth). We explore several parameters; eg; initialspatial distribution; spatial query area and temporal query length. We found out that the HR-tree usually outperforms the other candidates; in terms of query processing cost; speciallywhen querying time points and small time intervals. However; the main side effect of the …,*,1999,151
Analysis of SIGMOD's co-authorship graph,Mario A Nascimento; Jörg Sander; Jeffrey Pound,Abstract In this paper we investigate the co-authorship graph obtained from all paperspublished at SIGMOD between 1975 and 2002. We find some interesting facts; for instance;the identity of the authors who; on average; are" closest" to all other authors at a given time.We also show that SIGMOD's co-authorship graph is yet another example of a small world---a graph topology which has received a lot of attention recently.

ST 2 B-tree: a self-tunable spatio-temporal b+-tree index for moving objects,Su Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract In a moving objects database (MOD) the dataset and the workload changefrequently. As the locations of objects change in space and time; the data distribution alsochanges and the answer for a same query over the same region may vary widely over time.As a result; traditional static indexes are not able to perform well and it is critical to developself-tuning indexes that can be reconfigured automatically based on the state of the system.Towards this goal we propose the ST 2 B-tree; a Self-Tunable Spatio-Temporal B+-Treeindex for MODs; which is amenable to tuning. Frequent updates to its subtrees allowsrebuilding (tuning) a subtree using a different set of reference points and different grid sizewithout significant overhead. We also present an online tuning framework for the ST 2 B-tree; where the tuning is conducted online and automatically without human intervention …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,118
Aggregation convergecast scheduling in wireless sensor networks,Baljeet Malhotra; Ioanis Nikolaidis; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract We consider the problem of scheduling in wireless sensor networks for thepurposes of aggregation convergecast. We observe that existing schemes adopt essentiallya two phase approach; consisting of; first; a tree construction and; second; a schedulingphase. Following a similar approach; we propose two new improvements; one to each of thetwo phases. Starting with a new lower bound on the schedule length; we make use of it inthe tree construction phase. The tree construction phase consists of solutions to instances ofbipartite graph semi-matchings. The scheduling phase is a weight-based priority schemethat obeys dependency (tree) and interference constraints. Our extensive experiments showthat; overall; our proposed solution not only outperforms all previously proposed solutions interms of schedule length; but it also significantly extends the network's lifetime.,Wireless Networks,2011,93
A framework for spatio-temporal query processing over wireless sensor networks,Alexandru Coman; Mario A Nascimento; Jörg Sander,Abstract Wireless sensor networks consist of nodes with the ability to measure; store; andprocess data; as well as to communicate wirelessly with nodes located in their wirelessrange. Users can issue queries over the network; eg; retrieve information from nodes withina specified region; in applications such as environmental monitoring. Since the sensorshave typically only a limited power supply; energy-efficient processing of the queries overthe network is an important issue. In this paper; we introduce a general framework fordistributed processing of spatio-temporal queries in a sensor network that has two mainphases:(1) routing the query to the spatial area specified in the query;(2) collecting andprocessing the information from the nodes relevant to the query. Within this framework;different algorithms can be designed independently for each of the two phases.

A trajectory splitting model for efficient spatio-temporal indexing,Slobodan Rasetic; Jörg Sander; James Elding; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract This paper addresses the problem of splitting trajectories optimally for the purposeof efficiently supporting spatio-temporal range queries using index structures (eg; R-trees)that use minimum bounding hyper-rectangles as trajectory approximations. We derive aformal cost model for estimating the number of I/Os required to evaluate a spatio-temporalrange query with respect to a given query size and an arbitrary split of a trajectory. Based onthe proposed model; we introduce a dynamic programming algorithm for splitting a set oftrajectories that minimizes the number of expected disk I/Os with respect to an averagequery size. In addition; we develop a linear time; near optimal solution for this problem to beused in a dynamic case where trajectory points are continuously updated.

On “shapes” of colors for content-based image retrieval,Renato O Stehling; Mario A Nascimento; Alexandre X Falcao,Abstract Color is a commonly used feature for realizing content-based image retrieval(CBIR). Towards this goal; this paper presents a new approach for CBIR which is based onwell known and widely used color histograms. Contrasting to previous approaches; such asusing a single color histogram for the whole image; or local color histograms for a fixednumber of image cells; the one we propose (named Color Shape) uses a variable number ofhistograms; depending only on the actual number of colors present in the image. Ourexperiments using a large set of heterogeneous images and pre-defined query/answer setsshow that the Color Shape approach offers good retrieval quality with relatively low spaceoverhead; outperforming previous approaches.,Proceedings of the 2000 ACM workshops on Multimedia,2000,71
Improving web search efficiency via a locality based static pruning method,Edleno S De Moura; Célia F dos Santos; Daniel R Fernandes; Altigran S Silva; Pavel Calado; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract The unarguably fast; and continuous; growth of the volume of indexed (andindexable) documents on the Web poses a great challenge for search engines. This is trueregarding not only search effectiveness but also time and space efficiency. In this paper wepresent an index pruning technique targeted for search engines that addresses the latterissue without disconsidering the former. To this effect; we adopt a new pruning strategycapable of greatly reducing the size of search engine indices. Experiments using a realsearch engine show that our technique can reduce the indices' storage costs by up to 60%over traditional lossless compression methods; while keeping the loss in retrieval precisionto a minimum. When compared to the indices size with no compression at all; thecompression rate is higher than 88%; ie; less than one eighth of the original size.

An adaptive and efficient clustering-based approach for content-based image retrieval in image databases,Renato O Stehling; Mario A Nascimento; Alexandre X Falcão,The authors present a novel content based image retrieval (CBIR) approach; for imagedatabases; based on cluster analysis. CBIR relies on the representation (metadata) ofimages' visual content. In order to produce such metadata; we propose an efficient andadaptive clustering algorithm to segment the images into regions of high similarity. Thisapproach contrasts with those that use a single color histogram for the whole image (globalmethods); or local color histograms for a fixed number of image cells (partition basedmethods). Our experimental results show that our clustering approach offers high retrievaleffectiveness with low space overhead. For example; using a database of 20000 images; weobtained higher retrieval effectiveness than partition based methods with about the samespace overhead of global methods; which are typically regarded as storage-wise compact.,Database Engineering and Applications; 2001 International Symposium on.,2001,61
Indexing valid time databases via B/sup+/-trees,Mario A Nascimento; Margaret H Dunham,We present an approach; named MAP21; which uses standard B/sup+/-trees to provideefficient indexing of valid time ranges. The MAP21 approach is based on mapping onedimensional ranges to one dimensional points where the lexicographical order among theranges is preserved. The proposed approach may employ more than one tree; eachindexing a disjoint subset of the indexed data. When compared to the Time Index and theB/sup+/-tree we show that MAP21's performance is comparable to or better than those;depending on the type of query. In terms of storage; MAP21's structure was less than 10percent larger than the B/sup+/-tree's and much smaller than the Time Index's. The maincontribution of this paper though; is to show that standard B/sup+/-trees; available in virtuallyany DBMS; can be used to provide an efficient temporal index.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1999,61
PIST: an efficient and practical indexing technique for historical spatio-temporal point data,Viorica Botea; Daniel Mallett; Mario A Nascimento; Jörg Sander,Abstract Despite pressing need; current relational database management systems (RDBMS)support for spatio-temporal data is limited and inadequate; and most existing spatio-temporal indices cannot be readily integrated into existing RDBMSs. This paper proposes apractical index for spatio-temporal (PIST) data; an indexing technique; rather than a newindexing structure; for historical spatio-temporal data points that can be fully integratedwithin existing RDBMSs. PIST separates the spatial and temporal components of the data.For the spatial component; we develop a formal cost model and a partitioning strategy thatleads to an optimal space partitioning for uniformly distributed data and an efficient heuristicpartitioning for arbitrary data distributions. For the temporal component of the data a B+-treeis used. We show that this layer's performance can be maximized if an optimal maximal …,GeoInformatica,2008,56
Exact top-k queries in wireless sensor networks,Baljeet Malhotra; Mario A Nascimento; Ioanis Nikolaidis,In this paper; we consider the exact top-k query problem in wireless sensor networks; ie;where one seeks to find the k highest reported values as well as the complete set of nodesthat reported them. Our primary contribution in this context is EXTOK; a provably correct andtopology-independent new filtering-based algorithm for processing exact top-k queries. As asecondary contribution we confirm a previous result of ours by showing that the efficiency oftop-k query processing algorithms; including EXTOK; can be further improved by simplychoosing a proper underlying logical tree topology. We examine EXTOK's performance withrespect to a number of parameters and different logical tree topologies while using bothsynthetic and real data sets. Our simulation reveal that EXTOK consistently outperforms thecurrent state-of-the-art algorithm by a very significant margin and regardless of the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,46
Cell histograms versus color histograms for image representation and retrieval,Renato O Stehling; Mario A Nascimento; Alexandre X Falcão,Abstract. This paper presents a new approach for content-based image retrieval; which isbased on the well-known and widely used color histograms. Previous approaches haveused a single global color histogram (GCH) for the whole image; or local color histograms(LCHs) for cells within a grid of fixed size. Our approach is also based on a grid of cells; butunlike the latter it uses a cell histogram for each of the colors actually present in the images;representing how that color is distributed among the image cells--hence the name Cell/ColorHistograms. Our experiments have shown that the actual number of colors present in imagesis often low. Thus we are able to achieve performance comparable to using LCHs within agrid; but with a much smaller space overhead. Furthermore; the proposed approach is veryflexible in the sense that the user has alternative ways to calibrate the trade-off between …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2003,46
An analysis of spatio-temporal query processing in sensor networks,Alexandru Coman; Jörg Sander; Mario A Nascimento,Sensor networks are an emerging technology that provide new means to monitor andunderstand various phenomena. Nodes in a sensor network typically have a limited powersupply; thus energy-efficient processing of the queries over the network is a critical issue.We propose analytical models to evaluate the performance of three methods for processinghistorical spatio-temporal queries in sensor networks. The models allow us to betterunderstand the tradeoffs of the investigated methods; as well as to recommend the mostenergy efficient one at query time.,Data Engineering Workshops; 2005. 21st International Conference on,2005,41
Exploiting redundancy in sensor networks for energy efficient processing of spatiotemporal region queries,Alexandru Coman; Mario A Nascimento; Jörg Sander,Abstract Sensor networks are made of autonomous devices that are able to collect; store;process and share data with other devices. Spatiotemporal region queries can be used forretrieving information of interest from such networks. Such queries require the answers onlyfrom the subset of the network nodes that fall into the query region. If the network isredundant in the sense that the measurements of some nodes can be substituted by those ofother nodes with a certain degree of confidence; then a much smaller subset of nodes maybe sufficient to answer the query at a lower energy cost. We investigate how to takeadvantage of such data redundancy and propose two techniques to process spatiotemporalregion queries under these conditions. Our techniques reduce up to twenty times the energycost of query processing compared to the typical network flooding; thus prolonging the …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2005,37
Content based sub-image retrieval via hierarchical tree matching,Jie Luo; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract This paper deals with the problem of finding images that contain a given queryimage; the so-called content-based sub-image retrieval. We propose an approach based ona hierarchical tree that encodes the color feature of image tiles which are in turn stored as anindex sequence. The index sequences of both candidate images and the query sub-imageare then compared in order to rank the database images suitability with respect to the query.In our experiments; using 10;000 images and disk-resident metadata; for 60Σ (80Σ) of thequeries the relevant image; ie; the one where the query sub-image was extracted from; wasfound among the first 10 (50) retrieved images in about 0.15 sec.,Proceedings of the 1st ACM international workshop on Multimedia databases,2003,35
Adaptive processing of historical spatial range queries in peer-to-peer sensor networks,Alexandru Coman; Joerg Sander; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract We investigate the problem of processing historical queries on a sensor network.Since data is considered to have been already collected at the sensor nodes; the main issueis exploring the spatial component of the query in order to minimize its cost represented bythe energy consumption. We assume queries can be issued at any network node; ie; there isno central base station and all nodes have only local knowledge of the network. On the onehand; a globally optimum query processing plan is desirable but its construction is notpossible due to the lack of global knowledge of the network. On the other hand; while asimple network flooding is feasible; it is not a practical choice from a cost perspective. Toaddress this problem we propose a two-phase query processing strategy; where in the firstphase a path from the query originator to the query region is found and in the second …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2007,34
Techniques for color-based image retrieval,Renato O Stehling; Mario A Nascimento; Alexandre X Falcao,Abstract Image databases are becoming more and more common in several distinctapplication domains; such as (multimedia) search engines; digital libraries; medical andgeographic databases and criminal investigation. The evolution of techniques foracquisition; transmission and storage of images has also allowed the construction of verylarge image databases. All these factors have spurred great interest in image retrievaltechniques. Image retrieval is performed based on short descriptions of the images. Imagesmay be described by a set of content-independent attributes (file name; format; category;size; author's name; input device; date of creation and network/disk location) that can bemanaged through conventional database management systems—DBMS. The maindrawback of this approach is that the allowed queries are limited to those based on the …,*,2003,34

On join location in sensor networks,Alexandru Coman; Mario A Nascimento; Jorg Sander,We consider the problem of processing join queries in a wireless sensor network; focusingon where (which sensor node (s)) to process the join. We propose four strategies forprocessing such queries and investigate their performance across several scenarios. Notsurprisingly; our experiments show that no single strategy performs best for all scenarios. Inorder to avoid the potential high cost of using a fixed strategy for processing all queries; wedevelop a cost-based model that can be used to select the best join strategy for the query athand. Our experiments confirm that; given a set of queries; selecting the join strategy basedon the cost model is always better than using any fixed strategy for all queries.,Mobile Data Management; 2007 International Conference on,2007,33
Content-based sub-image retrieval using relevance feedback,Jie Luo; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract This paper presents the use of relevance feedback to the problem of content-basedsub-image retrieval (CBsIR). Relevance feedback is used to improve the accuracy ofsuccessive retrievals via a tile re-weighting scheme that assigns penalties to each tile ofdatabase images and updates the tile penalties for all relevant images retrieved at eachiteration using both the relevant (positive) and irrelevant (negative) images identified by theuser. Performance evaluation on a dataset of over 10;000 images shows the effectivenessand efficiency of the proposed framework. Using 64 quantized colors in the RGB colorspace; the system can achieve a stable average recall value of 70% within the top 20retrieved (and presented) images after only 5 iterations; with each such iteration takingabout 2 seconds.,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM international workshop on Multimedia databases,2004,33
Image indexing and retrieval using signature trees,Mario A Nascimento; Eleni Tousidou; Vishal Chitkara; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Significant research has focused on determining efficient methodologies foreffective and speedy retrieval in large image databases. Towards that goal; the firstcontribution of this paper is an image abstraction technique; called variable-bin allocation(VBA); based on signature bitstrings and a corresponding similarity metric. The signatureprovides a compact representation of an image based on its color content and yields betterretrieval effectiveness than when using classical global color histograms (GCHs) andcomparable to the one obtained when using color-coherence vectors (CCVs). Moreimportantly however; the use of VBA signatures allows savings of 75% and 87.5% in storageoverhead when compared to GCHs and CCVs; respectively.

Effective and efficient region-based image retrieval,Mario A Nascimento; Veena Sridhar; Xiaobo Li,Abstract Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is a challenging task. Current research worksattempt to obtain and use the semantics of image to perform better retrieval. Towards thisgoal; segmentation of an image into regions has been used in recent years; since localproperties of regions can help matching objects between images and thereby contributetowards a more effective CBIR. This paper improves on a CBIR technique; called SNL(Sridhar; Nascimento; Li) that utilizes the regional properties of the images. In SNL eachimage is segmented and features including the color; shape; size and spatial position of theobtained regions are extracted. Regions are then compared using the integrated regionmatching (IRM) distance measure; which is not a metric; which prevents the use of metricaccess structures or filtering techniques based on the triangle inequality.

Thestructure is based on incremental trees indexing valid time ranges; which are pointed to by atree indexing transaction time. Valid time trees are kept full at every so many transaction timepoints; and in between those; patching sets are kept. The valid time trees are B+-trees whichefficiently index ranges via a mapping function. Analytic performance results are presentedand discussed.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,1996,31

This paper presentsand evaluates three temporal extensions of the R-tree; the 3D R-tree; the 2+ 3 R-tree andthe HR-tree; which are capable of indexing spatiotemporal data. Our experiments haveshown that the while the HR-tree was the larger structure; its query processing cost was over50% smaller than the ones yielded by the 3D R-tree and the 2+ 3 R-tree. Also compared tothe (non-practical) approach of storing one R-tree for each of the spatial database states itoffered the same query processing cost; saving around one third of storage space.,*,1998,30

Decision time in temporal databases,Mario A Nascimento; Margaret H Eich,Abstract Most of the research found in the Temporal Database literature assumes the use ofvalid time and transaction time as temporal attributes supported by the DBMS. Some alsoassume a user-de ned time as a temporal attribute which is not supported by the DBMS. Wediscuss the reasons for the need of such support; in the context of the relational data model.We argue that decision time needs to be supported by the DBMS and we elaborate on adata structure that encompasses both decision time and transaction time. Examples areprovided to illustrate our arguments. Finally; based on the three temporal dimensions a newtaxonomy for database operations is sketched.,Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Temporal Representation and Reasoning,1995,28
A distributed algorithm for joins in sensor networks,Alexandru Coman; Mario A Nascimento,Given their autonomy; flexibility and large range of functionality; wireless sensor networkscan be used as an effective and discrete means for monitoring data in many domains.Typical sensor nodes are very constrained; in particular regarding their energy and memoryresources. Thus; any query processing solution over these devices should consider theirlimitations. We investigate the problem of processing join queries within a sensor network.Due to the limited memory at nodes; joins are typically processed in a distributed mannerover a set of nodes. Previous approaches have either assumed that the join processingnodes have sufficient memory to buffer the subset of the join relations assigned to them; orthat the amount of available memory at nodes is known in advance. These assumptions arenot realistic for most scenarios. In this context we propose and investigate DIJ; a …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2007.

We use this new approachto propose and experiment on simple and effective pruning methods that allow a fastconstruction of the pruned index. The methods proposed here are especially useful forpruning in environments where the document database changes continuously; such aslarge-scale web search engines. Extensive experiments are presented showing that theproposed methods can achieve high compression rates while maintaining the quality ofresults for the most common query types present in modern search engines; namely;conjunctive and phrase queries.

MiCRoM: A metric distance to compare segmented images,Renato O Stehling; Mario A Nascimento; Alexandre X Falcão,Abstract Recently; several content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems that make use ofsegmented images have been proposed. In these systems; images are segmented andrepresented as a set of regions; and the distance between images is computed according tothe visual features of their regions. A major problem of existing distance functions used tocompare segmented images is that they are not metrics. Hence; it is not possible to exploitfiltering techniques and/or access methods to speedup query processing; as bothtechniques make extensive use of the triangular inequality property-one of the metricaxioms. In this work; we propose microm (Minimum-Cost Region Matching); an effectivemetric distance which models the comparison of segmented images as a minimum-costnetwork flow problem. To our knowledge; this is the first time a true metric distance …,International Conference on Advances in Visual Information Systems,2002,21
Using pivots to speed-up k-medoids clustering,Adriano Arantes Paterlini; Mario A Nascimento; Caetano Traina Jr,Abstract Clustering is a key technique within the KDD process; with k-means; and the moregeneral k-medoids; being well-known incremental partition-based clustering algorithms. Afundamental issue within this class of algorithms is to find an initial set of medians (ormedoids) that improves the efficiency of the algorithms (eg; accelerating its convergence to asolution); at the same time that it improves its effectiveness (eg; finding more meaningfulclusters). Thus; in this article we aim at providing a technique that; given a set of elements;quickly finds a very small number of elements as medoid candidates for this set; allowing toimprove both the efficiency and effectiveness of existing clustering algorithms. We target theclass of k-medoids algorithms in general; and propose a technique that selects a well-positioned subset of central elements to serve as the initial set of medoids for the …,Journal of Information and Data Management,2011,20

Region-based image retrieval using multiple-features,Veena Sridhar; Mario A Nascimento; Xiaobo Li,Abstract Content-based image retrieval from large multimedia databases effectively andefficiently is a challenging task. In this paper; we propose a retrieval technique that utilizesthe regional properties of the images. After image segmentation; each region is representedby its colour; shape; size; and spatial position. Regions of different images are matched anda distance measure between the whole images is calculated. The relative importance of theabove features is investigated; and colour plays a major role in the process of distancecomputation. Our representation is robust to minor inaccuracy in image segmentation; isinvariant to scaling and can perceive geometric changes like translation and rotation. Theexperimental results indicate that our technique outperforms recently proposed techniques.,International Conference on Advances in Visual Information Systems,2002,19

In this paper; we propose two variations of anew image abstraction technique based on signature bit-strings and an appropriatesimilarity metric. The technique provides a compact representation of an image based on itscolor content and yields better retrieval effectiveness than classical techniques based on theimages' global color histograms (GCHs) and color coherence vectors (CCVs). The techniqueis also well-suited for use in a grid-based approach; where information about the spatiallocality of colors can be taken into account. Performance evaluation of image retrieval on aheterogeneous database of 20;000 images demonstrated that the proposed techniqueoutperforms the use of GCHs by up to 50%; and the use of CCVs by up to 20% in terms of …,*,2000,17
Indexing Valid Time Databases via B+-trees–The MAP21 Approach,Mario Nascimento; M Dunham,Abstract We present an approach named MAP21 which uses standard B+-trees; in amultiple disks single processor architecture; to provide e cient indexing of valid time ranges.The approach is based on mapping one dimensional ranges to one dimensional pointswhere the lexicographical order among the ranges is preserved. We compare MAP21 to theTime Index and the R-tree and we show that MAP21 is comparable to or outperforms those;depending on the number of trees utilized; the degree of parallelization among these andthe type of query. The main contribution of this paper is to show that standard B+-trees;available in virtually any DBMS; can be used to provide an e cient temporal index. Althoughour discussion is made in terms of valid time databases; MAP21 can be used (or extended tobe used) within other application domains as well.,History,1998,17
Building image mosaics: an application of content-based image retrieval,Yue Zhang; Mario A Nascimento; Osmar R Zaïane,An image mosaic is an image made up of many other images. In this paper we investigatethe automatic generation of such image mosaics; using content-based image retrieval as theunderlying framework. Our first contribution is to describe and evaluate a few parametersthat control the quality of the mosaic image. Our second contribution is the proposal of an(automatic) measure to assess the quality of the resulting images.

Distributed and efficient classifiers for wireless audio-sensor networks,Baljeet Malhotra; Ioanis Nikolaidis; Mario A Nascimento,This paper presents schemes to generate effective feature vectors of low dimension; andalso presents a cluster-based algorithm; where sensors form clusters on-demand for thesake of running a classification task based on the produced feature vectors. The featuresgenerated through our proposed schemes are evaluated using K-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN)and Maximum Likelihood (ML) classifiers. The proposed schemes are effective in terms ofclassification accuracy; and can even outperform previously proposed approaches; but; inaddition; they are also efficient in terms of communication overhead.,Networked Sensing Systems; 2008.

High-dimensional similarity searches using a metric pseudo-grid,Christian Digout; Mario A Nascimento,Despite the proposal of numerous tree-based access structures for high dimensionalsimilarity searches; techniques based on a sequential scan have been shown to be simpleyet quite efficient alternatives. Given that random accesses to disk are expensive; a linearscan of the (smaller) pre-processed dataset is often much more efficient than even arelatively small number of random disk accesses yielded by tree-based indices. In this paperwe present a technique which uses a pseudo-partition of a general metric space analog tothe VA-file's partition of the vector space. The rationale is to use a number of pivot objects inthe metric space; each one determining a number of hyper-rings in this space. Theintersection of those rings; determine pseudo-cells analog to the VA-file cells in the vectorspace. In order to speedup query processing the data set is clustered (using any …,Data Engineering Workshops; 2005. 21st International Conference on,2005,15

K-nearest neighbors queries in time-dependent road networks,Lívia A Cruz; Mario A Nascimento; José AF de Macêdo,Abstract In this article; we study the problem of processing k-nearest neighbors (kNN)queries in road networks considering traffic conditions; in particular the case where thespeed of moving objects is time-dependent. For instance; given that the user is at a givenlocation at certain time; the query returns the k points of interest (eg; gas stations) that can bereached in the minimum amount of time. Previous works have proposed solutions to answerkNN queries in road networks where the moving speed in each road is constant. Obviously;these solutions cannot be simply applied to the problem we are interested in. Our approachuses the well-known A∗ search algorithm by applying incremental network expansion andpruning unpromising vertices. We discuss the design and correctness of our algorithm andpresent experimental results that show the efficiency and effectiveness of our solution.,Journal of Information and Data Management,2012,14
Efficient and flexible cluster-and-search for cbir,Anderson Rocha; Jurandy Almeida; Mario A Nascimento; Ricardo Torres; Siome Goldenstein,Abstract Content-Based Image Retrieval is a challenging problem both in terms ofeffectiveness and efficiency. In this paper; we present a flexible cluster-and-search approachthat is able to reuse any previously proposed image descriptor as long as a suitablesimilarity function is provided. In the clustering step; the image data set is clustered using ahybrid divisive-agglomerative hierarchical clustering technique. The obtained clusters areorganized in a tree that can be traversed efficiently using the similarity function associatedwith the chosen image descriptors. Our experiments have shown that we can improvesearch-time performance by a factor of 10 or more; at the cost of small loss in effectiveness(typically less than 15%) when compared to the state-of-the-art solutions.,International Conference on Advanced Concepts for Intelligent Vision Systems,2008,14
A mixed breadth-depth first search strategy for sequenced group trip planning queries,Elham Ahmadi; Mario A Nascimento,We study Sequenced Group Trip Planning Queries (SGTPQs). Consider a road networkwhere some vertices represent Points of interest (POIs) and each POI belongs to exactly oneCategory of Interest (COI); eg; A COI can be" Restaurants" and each POI in this COI is aspecific instance of a restaurant. Given a group of users; each starting from a (possiblydistinct) source location and going ultimately to a (possibly distinct) destination; as well as aordered sequence of COIs; the SGTPQ finds; for each user; the route from his/her sourcelocation to his/her destination such that all users go through the same POIs; each onebelonging to the specified sequence of COIs; while minimizing the total distance travelled byall users in the group. Different from previous work which investigated SGTPQs in Euclideandistance; we focus on SGTPQs in the more realistic case of road networks.

Effective and efficient shape-based pattern detection over streaming time series,Yueguo Chen; Ke Chen; Mario A Nascimento,Existing distance measures of time series such as the euclidean distance; DTW; and EDRare inadequate in handling certain degrees of amplitude shifting and scaling variances ofdata items. We propose a novel distance measure of time series; Spatial AssemblingDistance (SpADe); that is able to handle noisy; shifting; and scaling in both temporal andamplitude dimensions. We further apply the SpADe to the application of streaming patterndetection; which is very useful in trend-related analysis; sensor networks; and videosurveillance. Our experimental results on real time series data sets show that SpADe is aneffective distance measure of time series. Moreover; high accuracy and efficiency areachieved by SpADe for continuous pattern detection in streaming time series.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,13
Enviro-Net: From networks of ground-based sensor systems to a web platform for sensor data management,Gilberto Z Pastorello; G Arturo Sanchez-Azofeifa; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract: Ecosystems monitoring is essential to properly understand their development andthe effects of events; both climatological and anthropological in nature. The amount of dataused in these assessments is increasing at very high rates. This is due to increasingavailability of sensing systems and the development of new techniques to analyze sensordata. The Enviro-Net Project encompasses several of such sensor system deploymentsacross five countries in the Americas. These deployments use a few different ground-basedsensor systems; installed at different heights monitoring the conditions in tropical dry forestsover long periods of time. This paper presents our experience in deploying and maintainingthese systems; retrieving and pre-processing the data; and describes the Web portaldeveloped to help with data management; visualization and analysis.,Sensors,2011,13
Efficient implementation and benchmark of interior point methods for the polynomial L1 fitting problem,Aurelio RL Oliveira; Mário A Nascimento; Christiano Lyra,Abstract Interior point methods specialized to the L 1 fitting problem are surveyed and theaffine-scaling primal method is presented. Their main features are highlighted andimprovements are proposed for polynomial fitting problems. For such problems; a carefulhandling of data avoids storing of matrices for the interior point approaches. Moreover; thecomputational complexity of iterations is reduced. An inexpensive way to compute a basicsolution; using interpolation; is also provided. Extensive numerical experiments are carriedout; including comparisons with a specialized simplex method. In general; the interior pointmethods performed better than the simplex approach. Among the interior point methodsinvestigated; the dual affine scaling version was the most efficient.,Computational statistics & data analysis,2000,13
Knowledge-enriched route computation,Georgios Skoumas; Klaus Arthur Schmid; Gregor Jossé; Matthias Schubert; Mario A Nascimento; Andreas Züfle; Matthias Renz; Dieter Pfoser,Abstract Directions and paths; as commonly provided by navigation systems; are usuallyderived considering absolute metrics; eg; finding the shortest or the fastest path within anunderlying road network. With the aid of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI); ie; geo-spatial information contained in user generated content; we aim at obtaining paths that donot only minimize distance but also lead through more popular areas. Based on theimportance of landmarks in Geographic Information Science and in human cognition; weextract a certain kind of VGI; namely spatial relations that define closeness (nearby; next to)between pairs of points of interest (POIs); and quantify them following a probabilisticframework. Subsequently; using Bayesian inference we obtain a crowd-based closenessconfidence score between pairs of POIs. We apply this measure to the corresponding …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2015,12
Taxonomy-Based Routing Indices for Peer-to-Peer Networks.,Luca Pireddu; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract On the one hand; the lack of structure of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks is key to theirrobustness and accessibility. On the other hand; this same lack of structure createsdifficulties in efficiently searching the contents of the network. This search problem must beaddressed for P2P networks to grow beyond the world of file sharing. To this end; wepresent a novel approach for describing the documents accessible through peers as ataxonomy. We propose a scoring function which is used to route queries within the networkbased on such taxonomical information; as well as the number of results desired by thequery. The scoring function aims to minimize the number of network messages required toanswer a query. When comparing to a sequential query forwarding algorithm; oursimulations have shown that our proposed technique is able to reduce the number of …,Workshop on Peer-to-Peer Information Retrieval,2004,12
An experiment stemming non-traditional text,Mario A Nascimento; Adriano CR Da Cunha,Stemming is a technique which aims to extract common suffixes of words. Thus; words whichare literally different but have a common stem; may be abstracted by their common stem.The underlying goal when using a stemming technique is to improve recall; at the possibleexpense of precision loss. A well known technique for stemming text is MF Porter's (1980)algorithm; which is based on a set of rules extracted from the English language. We arguethat such an algorithm it is not efficient for non traditional texts; eg; one made up mainly ofmedical terms. We thus investigate the use of a technique; called Peak-and-Plateau; whichis based on tries; and compare it to Porter's algorithm. Our experiments have shown thatusing Porter's algorithm or none at all makes no difference as far as precision and recallgoes. On the other hand using the Peak-and-Plateau technique we improved recall by …,String Processing and Information Retrieval: A South American Symposium; 1998. Proceedings,1998,12

With the aid of crowdsourced geospatial data we aim at obtaining paths that do notonly minimize distance but also lead through more popular areas using knowledgegenerated by users. We extract spatial relations such as" nearby" or" next to" from geo-textual travel blogs; that define closeness between pairs of points of interest (POIs) andquantify each of these relations using a probabilistic model. Using Bayesian inference; weobtain a probabilistic measure of spatial closeness according to the crowd. Applying thismeasure to the corresponding road network; we derive an altered cost function takingcrowdsourced spatial relations into account.

Snif: A simple nude image finder,Ruan JS Belém; Joao MB Cavalcanti; Edleno Silva de Moura; Mario A Nascimento,The lack of control of the content published is broadly regarded as a positive aspect of theWeb; assuring freedom of speech to its users. On the other hand; there is also a lack ofcontrol of the content accessed by users when browsing Web pages. In some situations thislack of control may be undesired. For instance; parents may not desire their children to haveaccess to offensive content available on the Web. In particular; accessing Web pages withnude images is among the most common problem of this sort. One way to tackle thisproblem is by using automated offensive image detection algorithms which can filterundesired images. Recent approaches on nude image detection use a combination offeatures based on color; texture; shape and other low level features in order to describe theimage content. These features are then used by a classifier which is able to detect …,Web Congress; 2005. LA-WEB 2005. Third Latin American,2005,11

An introductory survey to indexing techniques for temporal databases,Mario Nascimento; Margaret H Eich,Abstract This report presents a survey on the topic of indexing techniques for temporaldatabases assuming the relational data model as underlying framework. Temporaldatabases are to preserve the history of tuples; and hence relations; and therefore tuples arenever deleted; but versioned instead. Versioning; on the other hand; makes the databasesgrow unreasonably; and then some part of the database may be migrated to a lower level;slower but less expensive; storage. We review several indexing techniques that are toprovide some means to index such temporal databases and that to some extent cover theissues mentioned; focus is made on the used data structures. A comparison between thesetechniques is also made. Finally; we present potential data structures aimed to support trulybitemporal database indexing.,*,1995,10
A trajectory cleaning framework for trajectory clustering,Agzam Idrissov; Mario A Nascimento,ABSTRACT Trajectory clustering is the process of grouping similar trajectories according toa similarity distance. Several methods for trajectory clustering have been proposed.However; most of these methods require initial data preprocessing which are seldomexplained. To that end; this paper proposes a framework for cleaning trajectory data; whichconsists of three steps: stop detection; missing segment interpolation and inaccuracyremoval. Using Nokia's Mobile Data Challenge dataset as a sample application for ourframework and objective metric; we show that our data preprocessing approach improvesthe quality of trajectory clustering.,Mobile Data Challenge (by Nokia) Workshop,2012,9
The use of biomass fuels in gas turbine combined cycles: gasification vs externally fired cycle,Sandro Barros Ferreira; MAR Nascimento; P Pilidis,Abstract–The use of biomass as gas turbine combined cycle fuels is broadly seen as one ofthe alternatives to diminish greenhouse gas emissions; mainly CO2; due to the efficiencydelivered by such systems and the renewable characteristic of biomass itself. Integratedgasification cycles; BIGGT; are the current technology available; however the gasificationsystem severely penalizes the power plant in terms of efficiency and demands modificationsin the engine to accommodate the large fuel mass flow. This gives an opportunity toimprovements in the current technologies and implementation of new ones.

A multiple tree mappingbased approach for range indexing,Mario Nascimento; Margaret H Dunham; Vram KOURAMA-JIAN,Abstract In this paper we present MAP21; an indexing structure for ranges. The main idea isto map a bounded range to a point in one-dimensional space; using a standard B+-tree toindex such a point. MAP21 is storage-wise e cient; requiring O (N) storage; where N is thenumber of indexed ranges. Its maintainance is also e cient; requiring O (logN) accesses perupdate. We show that MAP21 is able to e ciently answer a number of di erent range basedqueries; requiring; O (logN+ L) I/Os; where L is the length of the range given in the query.Asymptotic bounds for the structure performance are compared to other previous researchand found to be better or at least comparable. We also present some experimental results;comparing the MAP21 approach to the Time Index; a well-known temporal indexingstructure; which demonstrates that MAP21 is a promising approach.,J.

On best drone tour plans for data collection in wireless sensor network,Rone Ilídio da Silva; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract The benefits of using mobile sinks or data mules for data collection in WirelessSensor Network (WSN) have been studied in several works. In this paper; we consider adrone with hovering capability as a mobile sink for data collection. Drones; however; havelimited power supply that restricts their flying time. Hence; in addition to the WSN's energycost; the energy cost of the drone itself must be also considered in order to increase theamount of collected data from the WSN. We investigate the problem of determining the bestdrone tour for data collection in a WSN; ie; we focus on minimizing the overall drone time;that is the drone ying time plus the time needed to collect data from all WSN nodes. Wepropose two heuristic algorithms to solve this problem. Our experimental results have shownthat the proposed heuristics provide performance close to the optimal one in small WSN …,Proceedings of the 31st Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2016,8

In this paper we propose two main contributions:(1) an efficient algorithm foranswering Histogram queries in a WSN; and (2) how to efficiently use the obtainedhistogram to also process other types of aggregate queries.

Continuous online index tuning in moving object databases,Su Chen; Mario A Nascimento; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract In a Moving Object Database (MOD); the dataset; for example; the location ofobjects and their distribution; and the workload change frequently. Traditional static indexesare not able to cope well with such changes; that is; their effectiveness and efficiency areseriously affected. This calls for the development of novel indexes that can be reconfiguredautomatically based on the state of the system. In this article; we design and present the ST2 B-tree; a Self-Tunable Spatio-Temporal B+-tree index for MODs. In ST 2 B-tree; the dataspace is partitioned into regions of different density with respect to a set of reference points.Based on the density; objects in a region are managed using a grid of appropriategranularity; intuitively; a dense region employs a grid with fine granularity; while a sparseregion uses a grid with coarse granularity. In this way; the ST 2 B-tree adapts itself to …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2010,8
Indexing a transaction-decision time database,Mario A Nascimento; Margaret H Dunham,Although most of the research found in the temporal data- base literature recognizes the needto support valid time and transaction time as temporal attributes; only a few pa- pers have recognizedthe role of decision (or event) time. Moreover; no indexing technique which encompasses decisiontime has been presented in the literature. We aim to fill this void by presenting an indexing structurethat is able to in- dex both transaction time and decision time under the same framework. Thisstructure is based on a B+-tree. An ex- tension to the proposed structure is presented to moreeffi- ciently handle the case where non-temporal data is also used in queries … The need oftemporal support in databases has been well discussed [14]; and most of the research has assumedthe use of either valid time or transaction time as those which need to be supported by the databasemanagement system (DBMS.)

Benchmarking temporal databases: A research agenda,Margaret H Dunham; Ramez Elmasri; Mario A Nascimento; Marion Sobol,Abstract There has been a lot of published research in the eld of temporal databases(TDBs); and much of it has been devoted to indexing structures. There has also been someresearch in the topic of benchmarks for Temporal Databases; but those have been focusedin evaluating the semantic expressiviness of a query language and/or the TDB modelcapabilities. Thus far; we have not seen much been done to design benchmarks to evaluateindexing structures for TDBs though. The goal in this paper is to provide a framework tobenchmark indexing structures/algorithms for TBDs. We also present ways to generateapplication independent test data; which are to be used in the benchmarking process.

Checkpointing and recovery in partitioned main memory databases,Xi Li; MH Eich; VJ Joseph; Z Gulzar; CH Corti; M Nascimento; A Peltier,Abstract We introduce a checkpointing technique speci cally aimed at Main MemoryDatabases. This technique assumes that main memory is divided into partitions based uponfrequency of update. These partitions are checkpointed independently at rates proportionalto the update frequency. A global checkpoint across all partitions is performed implicitlywhen each of the updated partitions has had a local checkpoint. This PartitionCheckpointing technique incurs low overhead during transaction processing with thepotential of saving substantial time during recovery in the event of system failure. Severalalgorithms for scheduling of checkpoints are presented and a performance analysis is alsoperformed.,Proc.

On the analysis of periodic mobility behavior,Zhiyu Wang; Mario A Nascimento; Mike H MacGregor,ABSTRACT Encounters between devices can be very useful for message routing in mobilenetworks where there is no fixed infrastructure. In this context; understanding user mobilebehaviour is essential to design effective and efficient network protocols. This paperpresents a generic methodology to model and find periodic encounter patterns. Using thismethodology and the Nokia-MDC datasets; we are able to find strong weekly and dailyperiodic behaviours that last up to a few months. The experimental results show thatcombining periodic behaviour from different network types; eg; Bluetooth; GSM; and WLANnetworks; is capable of providing communications to a large-scale network. Furthermore; wealso investigate whether the network formed by periodic encounters has a small-worldstructure.,Mobile Data Challenge Workshop; in conjunction with International Conference on Pervasive Computing,2012,7
Better tree-better fruits: using dominating set trees for MAX queries,Baljeet Malhotra; Mario A Nascimento; Ioanis Nikolaidis,Abstract Finding an aggregation of observed values; in particular the maximum value; is animportant type of query in wireless sensor networks. Previous proposals to find the maximumvalue; the so-called MAX query; relied on a given underlying logical tree topology for dataaggregation/forwarding; but did not pay due attention to the role of such topology. Focusingon the MAX queries we first argue that the underlying tree topology plays a very importantrole in the query processing cost. We then propose the use of a particular tree topology;based on Dominating Sets that is well suited to explore the network's physical topology forprocessing MAX queries efficiently. Experimental results obtained using real and syntheticdatasets confirm that by simply replacing the tree topologies used in previous proposals withthe Dominating Set-based Tree (DST) one can reduce the transmission cost of MAX …,Proceedings of the 5th workshop on Data management for sensor networks,2008,7
Similarity search and dimensionality reduction: Not all dimensions are equally useful,Christian Digout; Mario A Nascimento; Alexandru Coman,Abstract Indexing high-dimensional data is a well known problem. Techniques fordimensionality reduction which map D-dimensional objects onto ad-dimensional space (d≪D) are often used to speedup similarity queries. In this paper we show that one can furtherimprove query performance by initially overestimating the reduction; ie; reducing thedimensionality of the space to D′ dimensions; where d< D′< D; and; at query time;automatically choosing only d′; where d′< d; dimensions to be used–that is; using only afew good dimensions after the initial reduction of the dimensionality. By incorporating thisidea within a recently proposed technique; we can process range queries up to three timesfaster at the expense of limited storage overhead.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2004,7

Benchmarking access structures for the similarity retrieval of high-dimensional multimedia data,Nathan G Colossi; Mario A Nascimento,In multimedia databases it is usual to map objects into feature vectors in high dimensionalspaces. In order to speed query processing; access structures; or indices; are required.Classical spatial access structures such as the R*-tree are bound to fail when the spacedimensional is not low. Fortunately; several access structures for high dimensional spaces;eg; the SS-tree; SR-tree and M-tree have been proposed. However; each of those structureshave been benchmarked in a rather ad-hoc manner. The paper benchmarks and comparesall the above structures using a real dataset of 40000 high dimensional objects. Allstructures have been implemented on top of the GiST infrastructure to minimize the risk ofimplementation bias. Even though no structure can be claimed to be the undisputed winner;we have found that the SR-tree presents the best overall results.,Multimedia and Expo; 2000.

Using B+-trees as a practical alternative to the classical R-tree,Mario A Nascimento; Margaret H Dunham,Abstract In this paper we address the problem of indexing two-dimensional rectangles.Instead of a structure based on the R-tree; we propose the use of two B+-trees (potentiallyparallelizable); where each of them indexes the projected sides of the indexed rectangles.The proposed approach is shown to outperform the Classical R-tree; in terms of both thesize of the index and the number of I/Os to process a rectangle overlap type of query. Inaddition; the use of B+-trees renders the approach to be straightforward to be implementedin existing commercial DBMSs.,Proceedings of the 11th Brazilian Symposium on Databases (SBBD'96),1996,7

Optimal time-dependent sequenced route queries in road networks,Camila F Costa; Mario A Nascimento; José AF Macêdo; Yannis Theodoridis; Nikos Pelekis; Javam Machado,Abstract In this paper we present an algorithm for optimal processing of time-dependentsequenced route queries in road networks; ie; given a road network where the travel timeover an edge is time-dependent and a given ordered list of categories of interest; we find thefastest route between an origin and destination that passes through a sequence of points ofinterest belonging to each of the specified categories of interest. Our approach uses the A*search paradigm equipped with an admissible heuristic function; thus guaranteed to yieldthe optimal solution; along with a pruning scheme for further reducing the search space. Ourexperiments using a real data set have shown our proposed solution to be up to two ordersof magnitude faster than a previous solution extended to handle time-dependency.,Proceedings of the 23rd SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2015,6
Nearest neighbor queries with service time constraints in time-dependent road networks,Camila F Costa; Mario A Nascimento; José AF Macêdo; Javam de C Machado,Abstract We consider the problem of finding the closest point of interest in road networkswhere the travel time along each edge is a function of the departure time and the servicetime of the facilities are taken into consideration. More specifically; our query aims to find thepoint of interest (eg; a museum) in which the user can be served in the minimum amount oftime; accounting for both the travel time to the point of interest and the waiting time; if it isclosed. We discuss our proposed solution and present experimental results comparing thequality of the response returned by our proposed algorithm to an approach where possiblewaiting times are not considered.,Proceedings of the Second ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Mobile Geographic Information Systems,2013,6

The signature provides a compactrepresentation of an image based on its color content and yields better retrievaleffectiveness than when using classical global color histograms (GCHs) and comparable tothe one obtained when using Color-Coherence Vectors (CCVs). More importantly however;the use of VBA signatures allows savings of 75% and 87.5% in storage overhead whencompared to GCHs and CCVs; respectively. The second contribution is the improvementupon an access structure; the S-tree; exploring the concept of logical and physical pages …,*,2001,6
Color-Shape Histograms for Image...,Renato O Stehling; Mario A Nascimento; Alexandre X Falcao,Abstract Color is a commonly used feature for realizing content-based image retrieval(CBIR). In this context; this paper presents a new approach for CBIR which is based on wellknown and widely used color histograms. Contrasting to previous approaches; such asusing a single color histogram for the whole image; or local color histograms for a xednumber of image cells; the one we propose (named Color-Shape) uses a variable number ofhistograms; depending only on the actual number of colors present in the image; which ourexperiments have shown often to be low. Our experiments using a large set ofheterogeneous images and pre-defined query/answer sets show that the Color-Shapeapproach oers good retrieval quality with relatively low space overhead; outperformingprevious approaches. Furthermore; we also show that the proposed approach is very …,IN PROC. OF THE INTL. WORKSHOP ON MULTIMEDIA INFORMATION RETRIEVAL,2000,6
A framework for computation of popular paths from crowdsourced data,Gregor Jossé; Maximilian Franzke; Georgios Skoumas; Andreas Züfle; Mario A Nascimento; Matthias Renz,Directions and paths; as commonly provided by route guidance systems; are usually derivedconsidering absolute metrics; eg; finding the shortest path within the underlying roadnetwork. This demo presents a framework which uses crowdsourced geospatial data toobtain paths that do not only minimize travel time but also guide users along popular pointsof interest (POIs). By analyzing textual travel blog data and Flickr data; we define a measurefor popularity of POIs. This measure is used as an additional cost criterion in the underlyingroad network graph. Furthermore; we propose an approach to reduce the problem of findingpaths which maximize popularity while minimizing travel time to the computation ofbicriterion pareto optimal paths. The presented framework allows users to specify origin anddestination within a road network; returning the set of pareto optimal paths or a subset …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,5
Monochromatic RkNN queries in time-dependent road networks,Felix Borutta; Mario A Nascimento; Johannes Niedermayer; Peer Kröger,Abstract The problem of finding influence sets for a specific point; eg determining theinfluence of a location for a new restaurant on competitive restaurants; can be modeled asthe reverse k nearest neighbor (RkNN) query. Although a lot of research has already beenpublished on this topic; there is no adequate solution to solve the problem in time-dependent networks. In this work; we address RkNN queries in networks considering time-dependency; eg in road networks where traffic conditions influence the travel speed. Due tothat the reverse nearest neighbors set can change over time; even if the objects areassumed to be static. We present an algorithm that solves the monochromatic time-dependent RkNN problem efficiently for a specific point in time. This algorithm uses apruning technique to minimize the necessary network expansion.

A*-based solutions for knn queries with operating time constraints in time-dependent road networks,Camila F Costa; Mario A Nascimento; José Antônio Fernandes De Macêdo; Javam Machado,We consider the problem of finding the k nearest points of interest from a given location intime-dependent road networks; ie; One where travel time along each edge is a function ofthe departure time; and where the operating times of the points of interest are also taken intoconsideration. More specifically; we address the following query: find the k points of interestin which a user can start to be served in the minimum amount of time; accounting for both thetravel time to the point of interest and the waiting time; if it is closed. Previous works haveproposed solutions to answer kNN queries considering the time dependency of the networkbut not the operating times of the points of interest.

Exploiting local node cache in top-k queries within wireless sensor networks,Johannes Niedermayer; Mario A Nascimento; Matthias Renz; Peer Kröger; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract Top-k queries are a popular type of query in wireless sensor networks. Typicalsolutions rely on coordinated root-to-nodes and nodes-to-root messages and on maintainingfilters at the nodes; aiming at suppressing unnecessary messages; hence saving energyand furthering the network's lifetime. In this paper; we exploit the capability of a sensor nodeto cache a few recently observed values in order to determine" trends" for the observedvalues. Those trends can be used to further restrict the number of messages that need to beexchanged in the network; thus ultimately extending the network's lifetime. We compare ourapproach to the most recently proposed solutions in the literature using real and syntheticdatasets; and we show that our approach is able to improve the network's lifetime by up to28% without any loss in the quality of the answer.,Proceedings of the 18th SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2010,5

Continuous Quantile Query Processing in Wireless Sensor Networks.,Johannes Niedermayer; Mario A Nascimento; Matthias Renz; Peer Kröger; Hans-Peter Kriegel,ABSTRACT A major concern when processing queries within a wireless sensor network is tominimize the energy consumption of the network nodes; thus extending the networkslifetime. One way to achieve this is by minimizing the amount of communication required toanswer queries. In this paper we investigate exact continuous quantile queries; focusing onthe particular case of the median query. Many recently proposed algorithms determine aquantile by performing a series of refining histogram queries. For that class of queries; werecently proposed a cost-model to estimate the optimal number of histogram buckets withinan algorithm for minimizing the energy consumption of a query. In this paper; we extend thatalgorithm for continuous queries. Furthermore we also offer a new refinement-basedalgorithm that employs a heuristic to minimize the number of message transmissions.

Continuous probabilistic count queries in wireless sensor networks,Anna Follmann; Mario A Nascimento; Andreas Züfle; Matthias Renz; Peer Kröger; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract Count queries in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) report the number of sensornodes whose measured values satisfy a given predicate. However; measurements in WSNsare typically imprecise due; for instance; to limited accuracy of the sensor hardware. In thiscontext; we present four algorithms for computing continuous probabilistic count queries ona WSN; ie; given a query Q we compute a probability distribution over the number of sensorssatisfying Q's predicate. These algorithms aim at maximizing the lifetime of the sensors byminimizing the communication overhead and data processing cost. Our performanceevaluation shows that by using a distributed and incremental approach we are able toreduce the number of message transfers within the WSN by up to a factor of 5 whencompared to a straightforward centralized algorithm.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2011,4
On the trade-off between user-location privacy and queried-location privacy in wireless sensor networks,Ryan Vogt; Mario A Nascimento; Janelle Harms,Abstract By eavesdropping on a user's query in a sensor network; an adversary can deduceboth the user's location and his/her area of interest. In many domains it is desirable toguarantee privacy of both places. We propose an effective way to measure how well issuinga disperse set of k queries protects the user's area of interest. However; issuing k queriesinstead of one facilitates the adversary determining the user's location. To address thatissue; we define a quantitative measure of how much information the k queries leak aboutthe user's location. Experiments reveal that how dispersed the k queries are has no effect onthe privacy of the user's location. However; smaller k; randomized routing; and non-broadcast transmission improve the user's location privacy. We also show thatcompromising nodes in the user's network yields no significant advantage to the …,International Conference on Ad-Hoc Networks and Wireless,2009,4
A Performance Comparison among the Traditional R-trees; the Hilbert R-tree and the SR-tree,Ricardo Rodrigues Ciferri; Ana Carolina Salgado; Mario A Nascimento; GC Magalhaes,This work investigates the performance of several spatial access methods with respect to thedistribution of the indexed spatial objects. Although having gathered storage and insertioncosts as well this work focuses on some issues regarding query costs. The performanceresults have showed that the R/sup+/-tree was the best spatial index structure for the pointqueries and the enclosure range queries; whereas the R/sup*/-trees have produced the bestoutcomes for the intersection and the containment range queries. The Hilbert R-tree and theSR-tree have generated low performance results for any investigated query type. However;additional performance tests have showed that a variation in both the size and the shapeproperties of the data rectangles provided competitive results for the Hilbert R-tree and theSR-tree; mainly for the intersection and the containment queries.,Chilean Computer Science Society; 2003.

Benchmarking access structures for high-dimensional multimedia data,Nathan Colossi; Mario Nascimento,Abstract In multimedia databases it is usual to map objects into feature vectors in high-dimensional spaces. In order to speed query processing access structures; or indices; arerequired. Unfortunately; in the case of similarity queries; which are in fact nearest neighborqueries; classical spatial access structures such as the R*-tree are bound to fail when thespace dimensional is not low. Fortunately; on the other hand; several access structures forhigh dimensional spaces; eg; the SS-tree; SR-tree and M-tree have been proposed.However; each of those structures have been benchmarked in a rather ad-hoc manner. Thispaper benchmarks and compares all above structures using a real dataset of 40;000 high-dimensional objects.

A Two-Stage B+-tree Based Approach to Index Transaction Time.,Mario A Nascimento,ABSTRACT We present an approach which provides e cient indexing for transaction timeranges; or; more generally; ranges that behave like transaction time ranges; eg; records fortelephone calls. The approach makes use of two standard B+-trees with trivially specializednode split policies {which yield high node utilization ratios. We compare the proposedapproach; which we name 2S; to the Monotonic B+-tree (Elmasri et al.; 1992). Oursimulations show that the 2S approach yields a much smaller structure; and in all but one ofthe several investigate scenarios; it also provided comparable (or faster) query processingtime. The main contribution; however; lies in the fact that the 2S approach does not requirenovel data structures but well-known B+-trees.,IADT,1998,4
A proposal for indexing bitemporal databases via cooperative B/sup+/-trees,Mario A Nascimento; Margaret H Dunham,We propose an indexing structure for bitemporal databases. Such structure is based on twotrees; one indexing valid time and another indexing transaction time. The trees sharepointers to the actual data records; which are thus not duplicated. Bitemporal queries areprocessed by dividing the query in two parts; a valid time part and a transaction time part.Each tree is searched according to these partial queries; and the answer is determined bythe correct composition of the partial answers. We show how simple coordination of the treesearching; along with a simple assumption on the temporal data; improves query processingperformance. The proposed structure also allows querying either time dimension; separatelyfrom the other one.,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 1997. IDEAS'97. Proceedings.; International,1997,4
Performance of the MAP21 access structure for temporal ranges,Mario A Nascimento; Margaret H Dunham; Ramez Elmasri,Abstract This paper introduces MAP21; a mapping-based indexing approach for ranges.Although MAP21 can be used in many applications where ranges need to be indexed; wefocus on the domain of temporal databases in particular. MAP21 allows proactive andretroactive updates; uses O (N) space; and has O (logN) update time and O (logN+ L) queryprocessing time. Here N is the number of indexed ranges and L is the length of the rangegiven in the query's input. A simple extension to MAP21 allows it to index open-endedranges as well. We present the structure of MAP21 and search algorithms; with correctnessarguments; for range queries and also compare its performance against the Time Index. Weshow that MAP21 performs better than the Time Index in a majority of cases while it isalways more e cient regarding space requirements and update time.,*,1996,4

Discovering periodic patterns of nodal encounters in mobile networks,Zhiyu Wang; Mario A Nascimento; Mike H MacGregor,Abstract Routing in Delay Tolerant Networks is very challenging because of frequentdisconnections. One cause of disconnection is node movement. Disconnections can beovercome by finding a set of sequential opportunistic encounters between pairs of mobilenodes. These encounters can be used for message forwarding and delivery. In this context;understanding user mobile behaviour is essential to design effective and efficient networkprotocols. This paper presents a generic methodology to model and find periodic encounterpatterns by using the auto-persistence function and detection techniques derived from it.From the studies on four real mobility traces; we are able to detect strong weekly periodicencounter patterns with an accuracy of up to 100%. The experimental results show thatperiodic encounter patterns in real mobility traces do not last long; eg; years; because …,Pervasive and Mobile Computing,2013,3
Discovering Spatial Co-Clustering Patterns in Traffic Collision Data,Dapeng Li; Joerg Sander; Mario A Nascimento; Dae-Won Kwon,Abstract Identifying spatial patterns of traffic collisions is critical for improving the efficiencyand effectiveness of the deployment of traffic enforcement resources as well as road safety.In recent years; many studies have focused on finding locations with high collisionconcentration; so-called hotspots; without integrating the likely available non-spatialattributes into analysis. In this paper we propose a method for identifying the sets of non-spatial attribute-value pairs (AVPs) that together contribute significantly to the spatialclustering of the corresponding collisions. We call such a set of AVPs a Spatial Co-Clustering Pattern (SCCP). By applying our method on the city of Edmonton's historicalcollision data; we discovered a larger number of meaningful hotspot patterns than traditionalhotspot analysis methods did; and revealed the relevant non-spatial indicators for …,Proceedings of the Sixth ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Computational Transportation Science,2013,3

An adaptive refinement-based algorithm for median queries in wireless sensor networks,Khaled Ammar; Mario A Nascimento; Johannes Niedermayer,Abstract A number of papers concerning algorithms for processing typical aggregatequeries; eg; Max and Top-k; within a wireless sensor network have been published in recentyears. However; relatively few have addressed Median queries. In this paper we propose anexact algorithm to process Median queries that is based on a series of refinement queries.Each refinement query is a Histogram query; with the aim of incrementally refining the rangewhere the actual median value resides. Because the cost of a Histogram query dependsmostly on the structure of the histogram itself; we aim at optimizing each Histogram query;hence optimizing the overall cost of the Median query. Experiments; using synthetic and realdatasets; show that our proposed approach yields up to 50% less traffic than a TAG-basedsolution and only about 25% more traffic on average than the minimum required.,Proceedings of the 10th ACM International Workshop on Data Engineering for Wireless and Mobile Access,2011,3

In many applications; users are interested in statisticalsummaries of the observed data; eg; histograms reflecting the distribution of the collectedvalues. In this paper we discuss how to leverage on a histogram query processing algorithmin order to process other aggregate queries within a WSN exactly.

Optimizing query processing in cache-aware wireless sensor networks,Mario A Nascimento; Romulo AE Alencar; Angelo Brayner,Abstract Most models for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) assume the existence of a basestation where query results could in principle be cached; however; the opportunity for re-using such cached data for minimizing data traffic in the WSN has not been well exploredthus far. Aiming at filling this gap; we propose an approach that first clips the original queryinto a polygon after selectively choosing a good subset of the cached queries for reuse.Next; this polygon is partitioned into sub-queries that are then submitted to the WSN. Thesetwo problems are interconnected and lead to a highly combinatorial problem that justifies theuse of efficient and effective heuristics. This paper presents algorithms for each of theseproblems that are used within a cost-driven optimization search in order to find a set of sub-queries that minimizes the cost of in-network query processing.

Using two B+-trees to efficiently process inclusion spatial queries,Mario A Nascimento; Margaret H Dunham,ABSTRACT In this paper we address the problem of indexing spatial data; in particular twodimensional rectangles. We propose an approach which uses two B+-trees; each of themindexing the projected sides of the given rectangles. The approach; which we name2dMAP21; can also be easily parallelized. We focus on queries of the type “find allrectangles included within another (reference) rectangle”. We compare our approach to theR.-tree; known as the most efficient R-tree derivative. Our investigation shows that if thequeries have the same spatial distribution as the data; the non-parallel 2dMAP21 may becompetitive whereas the parallelized version of 2dMAP21 outperforms the R*-tree virtuallyalways. The use of Bttrees renders our approach to be practical.,Proceedings of the 5th ACM international workshop on Advances in geographic information systems,1997,3

Thus far; the related literature presents no research on indexing bitemporaldatabases; only single-dimensional temporal indexing has been investigated. In this paperwe present two indexing structures for bitemporal databases; which incorporate both validtime and transaction time. They are based on a tree structure that indexes transaction time;and points to a forest of trees that index valid time. The forest of valid time trees is kept in anincremental mode. This saves substantial space at the expense of search time whenreferring to past states of the database. Queries referring to the current state of the databasesu er no loss.

For the latter; one needs to be able toeffectively route queries from a base station to the queried object in an efficient way; ie; withminimum energy-cost or minimum delay. A complicating factor is that in many domains themobile objects may not form a single connected component at all times.

Another scheme; Randomized MultipleCircles (RMC); is based on a technique proposed by Licks [8] which embeds a binary stringby modifying the Fourier coefficients along concentric circles. We introduce a randomperturbation into the radius of the circles to protect the waterwark from removal(cryptographic attack).

An incremental batch-oriented index for bitemporal databases,Jefferson RO Silva; Mario A Nascimento,Bitemporal databases record not only the history of tuples in temporal tables; but also recordthe history of the databases themselves. We address the problem of indexing suchbitemporal databases by investigating the use of an incremental indexing structure; the HR-tree; which was originally aimed at spatiotemporal databases. The HR-tree's most attractivefeature is that it can process queries as if all previous database snapshots were indexedphysically; however; all such states are indexed only logically. In our experiments we havefound that the HR-tree is much more efficient (up to 80% faster) than previously proposedapproaches based on two coordinated R-trees when processing queries based on a singletransaction time point and valid time being either point or intervals.

Using B+-trees in a two disk-single processor architecture to efficiently process inclusion spatial queries..,MA Nascimento; MH Dunham,Contenido: In this paper we address the problem of indexing spatial data; in particular twodimensional rectangles. We propose an approach which uses two B+-trees; each of themindexing the project sides of the given rectangles. The approach; which we name 2dMAP21;can also be easily parallelized using two disks-but still a single processor-each holding thetreess indexing the projected sides on either axes. We focus on queries of the type" find allrectangles included within another (reference) rectangle". Nevertheless; 2dMAP21 canprocesse other types of wueries as well. We compare our approach to the R*-tree; known asthe most efficient R-tree derivative. Our investigation shows that; if the queries have thesame spatial distribution of the data; the non-parallel 2dMAP21 may be a competitivealternative to the R*-tree in some cases; whereas the parallelized version of 2dMAP21 …,*,1997,2
A mapping-based approach for range indexing,Mario A Nascimento; Margaret H Dunham; Vram Kouramajian,Abstract In this paper we present an indexing structure for ranges. The main idea is to map abounded range to a point in one-dimensional space; using a standard B+-tree to index sucha point. The indexing structure is storage-wise e cient; requiring O (N); where N is thenumber of indexed ranges. Its maintainance is also e cient; requiring O (logN) accesses perupdate. We also show that it is able to e caciously answer a number of di erent queries;requiring; for instance; O (logN+ L) I/Os to answer an intersection type of query; where L isthe length of the range given in the query. An analytical performance study is alsopresented. Finally; we point out two immediate applications of this indexing approach; whichare (1) answering stabbing queries and (2) the indexing of a valid-time (historical) database.,*,1995,2
An experiment using prolog to investigate trace specifications,Mario A Nascimento; Weidong Chen; Clenio F Salviano; Murat M Tanik,Abstract When we are to build a complete software system; it is widely recognized that aproper decomposition of the system in modules can speedup and facilitate the softwarebuilding process. Such decomposition can be accomplished by means of modeling softwaremodules as Abstract Data Types (ADTs). ADTs can be formally specified by using Bartussekand Parnas' TRACE. We investigate the suitability of using Prolog to translate TRACEspecifications into a TRACE-like format in Prolog format. Thus we should be able to run boththe actual implementation and the TRACE specification and then verify whether theimplementation matches the specification. Additionally; we can partly avoid the maintenanceof test-cases databases as the specification itself can provide output according to a giveninput.

Knowledge extraction from crowdsourced data for the enrichment of road networks,Gregor Jossé; Klaus Arthur Schmid; Andreas Züfle; Georgios Skoumas; Matthias Schubert; Matthias Renz; Dieter Pfoser; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract In current navigation systems quantitative metrics such as distance; time andenergy are used to determine optimal paths. Yet; a “best path”; as judged by users; mighttake qualitative features into account; for instance the scenery or the touristic attractivenessof a path. Machines are unable to quantify such “soft” properties. Crowdsourced dataprovides us with a means to record user choices and opinions. In this work; we surveyheterogeneous sources of spatial; spatio-temporal and textual crowdsourced data as aproxy for qualitative information of users in movement. We (i) explore the process ofextracting qualitative information from uncertain crowdsourced data sets employing differenttechniques;(ii) investigate the enrichment of road networks with the extracted information byadjusting its properties and by building a meta-network; and (iii) show how to use the …,Geoinformatica,2017,1
IBS: An Efficient Stateful Algorithm for Optimal Sequenced Group Trip Planning Queries,Elham Ahmadi; Mario A Nascimento,Consider a road network where some vertices represent points-of-interests (POIs) and eachPOI belongs to exactly one category-of-interest (COI). Within that context; consider a groupof travelers; each leaving from their source locations towards their destinations (all possiblydistinct); as well as a sequence of COIs that the group is interested to visit. A SequencedGroup Trip Planning Query (SGTPQ) returns; for each traveler; the route from their sourcelocations to their destinations such that all users go through the same POIs; each onebelonging to the specified sequence of COIs; while minimizing the total distance traveled bythe group. Previous proposals for processing SGTPQs require examining some POIsrepeatedly; thus incurring in redundant computation. In order to overcome that we state theSuffix Optimality Principle; which allows efficient reuse of previously computed optimal …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2017 18th IEEE International Conference on,2017,1
IDA 2016 Industrial Challenge: Using Machine Learning for Predicting Failures,Camila Ferreira Costa; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract This paper presents solutions to the IDA 2016 Industrial Challenge which consistsof using machine learning in order to predict whether a specific component of the AirPressure System of a vehicle faces imminent failure. This problem is modelled as aclassification problem; since the goal is to determine if an unobserved instance represents afailure or not. We evaluate various state-of-the-art classification algorithms and investigatehow to deal with the imbalanced dataset and with the high amount of missing data. Ourexperiments showed that the best classifier was cost-wise 92.56% better than a baselinesolution where a random classification is performed.,International Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis,2016,1
K-closest pairs queries in road networks,Elham Ahmadi; Mario A Nascimento,Given two sets of nodes P and Q on a road network; a k-Closest Pairs Query (k-CPQ) findsthe pairs from P× Q which have the k smallest network distances. Although this problem hasbeen well studied in the Euclidean and metric spaces; this is the first time it is beinginvestigated in the more realistic case of road networks. As our first contribution; we presenta new indexing structure; named G-tree; which is designed to support our proposedalgorithms. Then; we propose; as our main contribution; two different approaches forprocessing k-CPQs. While the first approach applies a top-down traversal paradigm byapplying a best-first search strategy; the second approach looks for the k-closest pairs bytraversing the G*-tree in a bottom-up manner. Both of the these approaches employ aneffective pruning strategy for shrinking the search space based on the minimum network …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2016 17th IEEE International Conference on,2016,1
Meet-and-go: finding optimal single connecting points considering companionship preferences,George Tsatsanifos; Alexandr Petcovici; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract Consider the problem of a group of friends who want to depart from their currentlocations (eg; workplaces) towards a common destination (eg; a restaurant) but also want tomeet at a single intermediary point before continuing traveling together from there. The goalis to minimize an aggregate perceived travel cost by taking advantage of companionship;eg; a pre-defined mutual affinity factor; motivated by the common impression that" time flieswhen in good company". This is an instance of what we name as the Optimal SingleConnecting Point (OSCP) query. In this paper we present Meet-and-Go; a prototypeapplication with a simple interface for solving instances of the (top) k-OSCP query; thusallowing the user to also explore alternative solutions as well.,Proceedings of the 23rd SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2015,1
Continuous Median Queries in Wireless Sensor Networks,Khaled Ammar; Mario A Nascimento,A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consists of a set of small and autonomous sensingnodes; which possess limited energy and computational capabilities; and are typically usedto monitor events. In many applications; one is interested in continuous and robust statisticalsummaries of the observed values; and in this paper we focus on reporting the median of theobserved values gathered by the WSN. Keeping in mind that the nodes' energy consumptionis paramount in a WSN; we propose a distributed and energy-efficient approach based onthe use of multiple; suitably designed; histogram queries which efficiently explore existingcached results minimizing the number of bytes transmitted. Our experimental results; usingsynthetic and real datasets; show that our proposed solution is indeed able to substantiallyextend the lifespan of the WSN when compared to the current state-of-the-art.,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2015 16th IEEE International Conference on,2015,1
Special issue on spatial and temporal database management,Mario A Nascimento; Timos Sellis; Reynold Cheng,It is commonplace to say nowadays that there is more data being made available than everbefore. Much of this new data is created by mobile devices; such as car sensors andsmartphones; which are practically ubiquitous.

Optimal encounter-based routing via objects with periodic behaviours,Zhiyu Wang; Mario A Nascimento; Mike H MacGregor,In MANETs; communication often relies on finding a set of sequential opportunisticencounters between pairs of mobile nodes. In this context; understanding mobile nodebehaviour is essential to design effective and efficient network protocols. One characteristicthat emerges from node mobility is that mobile nodes often have periodic behaviours. In thispaper we take advantage of periodically repeated encounters between nodes. Given theseencounter patterns; we show how to model routing as an optimization problem in a graphwith a domain-specific constraint. Further; we propose polynomial time algorithms to find theoptimal and near-optimal solutions. Experimental results show that our proposedapproaches always find better routes compared to other state-of-the-art protocols.,Local Computer Networks Workshops (LCN Workshops); 2014 IEEE 39th Conference on,2014,1
Cost-based quantile query processing in wireless sensor networks,Johannes Niedermayer; Mario A Nascimento; Matthias Renz; Peer Kröger; Khaled Ammar; Hans-Peter Kriegel,In this paper we investigate how to efficiently and effectively use histogram queries forprocessing quantile queries in wireless sensor networks. A major concern when processingqueries within such an environment is to minimize the energy consumption by the networknodes; thus extending the networks lifetime; eg; the time when the first node runs out ofenergy. Towards that goal; we define a cost model for a refinement-based algorithm thatperforms a series of refining histogram queries in order to determine the exact quantilevalue. Given that the histogram size; ie; its number of bins; is an important factor in the queryprocessing cost; we use the defined cost model to estimate the histogram size thatminimizes the maximum energy cost per-node when processing the quantile query. This isequivalent to maximizing the time until the first node dies and therefore to extending the …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on,2013,1

Two-level cache architecture to reduce memory accesses for IP lookups,Sunil Ravinder; Mario A Nascimento; Michael H MacGregor,Longest-prefix matching (LPM) is a key processing function of Internet routers. This is animportant step in determining which outbound port to use for a given destination address.The time required to look up the outbound port must be less than the minimum inter-arrivaltime between packets on a given input port. Lookup times can be reduced by cachingaddress prefixes from previous lookups. However all misses in the prefix cache (PC) willinitiate a traversal of the routing table to find the longest matching prefix for the destinationaddress. This table is stored in memory so a traversal requires multiple (perhaps many)memory references. These memory references become an increasingly serious bottleneckas line rates increase. In this paper we present a novel second level of caching that can beused to expedite lookups that miss in the PC. We call this second level a dynamic …,Teletraffic Congress (ITC); 2011 23rd International,2011,1
A Multidisciplinary Approach for Online Detection of X86 Malicious Executables,Zhiyu Wang; Mario A Nascimento; Mike H MacGregor,The detection of malicious executables (malware) is a well known problem. Anti-malwaresoftware are typically signature based; and only malicious attacks containing those knownsignatures can be detected. This is problematic because new malware is appearingextremely rapidly. This threatens to overwhelm signature-based approaches. In this paper;we propose a novel approach to detect malicious executables by using a combination oftechniques from bioinformatics; data mining and information retrieval. This method is able toidentify new malware related to threats already in its database. Using relatively smalltraining sets our technique is able to achieve over 90% accuracy of detection with a falsepositive rate smaller than 5%.,Communication Networks and Services Research Conference (CNSR); 2010 Eighth Annual,2010,1
Content-Based Sub-Image Retrieval with Relevance Feedback,Jie Luo; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract: The typical content-based image retrieval problem is to find images within adatabase that are similar to a given query image. This paper presents a solution to adifferent problem; namely that of content based sub-image retrieval; ie; finding images froma database that contains another image. Note that this is different from finding a region in a(segmented) image that is similar to another image region given as a query. We present atechnique for CBsIR that explores relevance feedback; ie; the user's input on intermediaryresults; in order to improve retrieval efficiency. Upon modeling images as a set ofoverlapping and recursive tiles; we use a tile re-weighting scheme that assigns penalties toeach tile of the database images and updates the tile penalties for all relevant imagesretrieved at each iteration using both the relevant and irrelevant images identified by the …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0904.4041,2009,1
Radial projection: a feature extraction method for topographical shapes,Yong-Il Kwon; Ho-Hyun Park; Jixue Liu; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract Topographical images such as aerial and satellite images are usually similar withrespect to colors and textures but not in shapes. Thus shape features of the images and themethods of extracting them become critical for effective image retrieval from topographicalimage databases. In this paper; we propose a shape feature extraction method as well as asimilarity function for topographical image retrieval. The method extracts a set of attributeswhich can model the presence of holes and disconnected regions in images and is tolerantto pre-processing; more specifically segmentation; errors. Experiments suggest that retrievalusing attributes extracted using the proposed method performs better than using theCurvature Scale Space (CSS) which is a well known method in the area of shape featureextraction.,Pacific-Rim Conference on Multimedia,2005,1
Towards Understanding Latent Semantic Indexing,Bin Cheng,Abstract The increasing amount of information available has made information retrieval toolsbecome more and more important. Traditionally; these tools retrieve information by literallymatching terms in the documents with the terms in the query. Unfortunately; because ofsynonymy and polysemy; the retrieval results of lexical matching approaches are sometimesincomplete and inaccurate. Conceptual-indexing techniques such as Latent SemanticIndexing (LSI) have been used to overcome the problems of lexical matching. The LSI modeluses a statistical technique; singular value decomposition (SVD); to reveal the" latent"semantic structure and eliminate much of the" noise"(variability of word choice). Therefore;LSI is able to deal with the problems caused by synonymy and polysemy. Experiments showthat LSI outperforms lexically matching methods on some well-known test document …,*,2003,1
Experimental results towards content-based sub-image retrieval,Tao Wang; Juhua Shi; Mario A Nascimento,We are interested in the problem of sub-image retrieval (CBSIR); ie; given a query imageone must find the best candidate images that contain that query image. We use two kinds ofimage feature vectors: global color histograms and autocorrelograms and experimented withseveral distance measures for both feature vectors in our experimental system. Afterextensive experimentation we found that using autocorrelograms with the so-called S/sub1/distance measure yielded excellent results for sub-image retrieval with an acceptableprocessing overhead.,Information Technology: Coding and Computing; 2002.

Using JAVA to implement agents in artificial ecosystems,Kleber XS de Souza; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract: An Artificial Ecosystem is a self-contained environment populated by independententities representing some level of organization. Agents implement levels of abstractionrepresenting entities in a system. Agents can also explore parallelism and cooperative work.artificial ecosystems can thus be implemented using agents; where a global pattern is notcoded in the agents specifications; but is a result of their interactions. The Java languageprovides parallel threads of control and runs in a number of very distinct hardwarearchitectures. As such; in this paper we illustrate the suitability of Java to implement artificialecosystems using the artificial ecosystems paradigm.,First European Conference for Information Technology in Agriculture,1997,1

Best-Compromise In-Route Nearest Neighbor Queries,Elham Ahmadi; Camila F Costa; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract Humans are animals of habit; eg; people follow typical and/or familiar paths in theirdaily routines. With that in mind we investigate the problem where a user; traveling onhis/her preferred path; needs to visit one of many available points-of-interest while (1)minimizing his/her total travel distance and also (2) minimizing the detour distance incurredto reach the chosen point-of-interest. We call this new problem the" Best-Compromise In-Route Nearest Neighbor" query in order to emphasize that a route cannot typically optimizeboth criteria at the same time; but rather find a compromise between them. In fact; thecompeting nature of these two criteria resembles the notion of skyline queries. In thatcontext; we propose a solution based on using suitable upper-bounds to both cost criteria toprune uninteresting paths. It returns all linearly non-dominated paths that are optimal …,Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2017,*
MinMax Routing: The Case for Safer Routes for Electric Vehicles,Martin Ichilevici de Oliveira; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract MinMax routing is the task of finding a feasible route between two points such thatthe maximum distance between any point in the path and a set of points-of-interest isminimal. In this demonstration paper we focus on the case of routing electric vehicles andwhere points-of-interest are charging stations. In this scenario; the MinMax route guaranteesthat for any arbitrary point in such a route; the maximum distance that has to be traveled inorder to reach a charging station is minimal; being thus a" safer" route. We propose asolution to the MinMax routing problem and implement a web-based prototype that producespractical MinMax routes in realistic sized networks; eg; the state of California; in sub-secondprocessing time.,Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2017,*
Efficient Computation of Multiple Density-Based Clustering Hierarchies,Antonio Cavalcante Araujo Neto; Joerg Sander; Ricardo JGB Campello; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract: HDBSCAN*; a state-of-the-art density-based hierarchical clustering method;produces a hierarchical organization of clusters in a dataset wrt a parameter mpts. While theperformance of HDBSCAN* is robust wrt mpts in the sense that a small change in mptstypically leads to only a small or no change in the clustering structure; choosing a" good"mpts value can be challenging: depending on the data distribution; a high or low value formpts may be more appropriate; and certain data clusters may reveal themselves at differentvalues of mpts. To explore results for a range of mpts values; however; one has to runHDBSCAN* for each value in the range independently; which is computationally inefficient.In this paper; we propose an efficient approach to compute all HDBSCAN* hierarchies for arange of mpts values by replacing the graph used by HDBSCAN* with a much smaller …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.04545,2017,*
Towards Spatially-and Category-Wise k-Diverse Nearest Neighbors Queries,Camila F Costa; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) queries are well-known and widely used in a plethora ofapplications. In the original definition of k-NN queries there is no concern regarding diversityof the answer set; even though in some scenarios it may be interesting. For instance;travelers may be looking for touristic sites that are not too far from where they are but thatwould help them seeing different parts of the city. Likewise; if one is looking for restaurantsclose by; it may be more interesting to return restaurants of different categories or ethnicitieswhich are nonetheless relatively close. The interesting novel aspect of this type of query isthat there are competing criteria to be optimized. We propose two approaches that leveragethe notion of linear skyline queries in order to find spatially-and category-wise diverse k-NNswrt a given query point and which return all optimal solutions for any linear combination of …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2017,*
k-Optimal meeting points based on preferred paths,Elham Ahmadi; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract In this paper; we investigate a novel query type for road networks; namely the k-Optimal Meeting Points based on Preferred paths (k-OMP 3) query. Consider a group offriends currently at different places; eg; their offices. Before going to their respective homes;using their own preferred paths in the underlying road network; the group is willing to meetat a restaurant for dinner. A k-OMP 3 query would return the k restaurants that wouldminimize the group detour distance. In this short paper we present a provably correctapproach which exploits the geometric properties of the problem in order to reduce thequery's processing time.

Reverse k-nearest neighbour schedules in time-dependent road networks,Felix Borutta; Mario A Nascimento; Johannes Niedermayer; Peer Kröger,Abstract Despite the wealth of research published on reverse k-nearest neighbour (RkNN)queries very few attempts have been made to solve the problem in time-dependentnetworks; ie; networks where the edge cost varies with time. A typical example of suchnetwork is one made of a city's streets. An interesting consequence of such assumption isthat set of RkNNs can change over time even if the objects are not moving. We present anefficient algorithm that computes a RkNN schedule for a given time interval; eg; one day.Once computed; such schedule allows one to find the RkNNs for any point within the giventime interval doing a simple table lookup. We experimentally evaluate our novel methodsusing a straightforward solution; namely computing the RkNN set for every (discrete) instantwithin a time interval.

Monitoring Probabilistic Threshold SUM Query Processing in Uncertain Streams,Nina Hubig; Andreas Züfle; Tobias Emrich; Matthias Renz; Mario A Nascimento; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract Many sources of data streams; eg geo-spatial streams derived from GPS-trackingsystems or sensor streams provided by sensor networks are inherently uncertain due toimpreciseness of sensing devices; due to outdated information; and due to human errors. Inorder to support data analysis on such data; aggregation queries are an important class ofqueries. This paper introduces a scalable approach for continuous probabilistic SUM queryprocessing in uncertain stream environments. Here we consider an uncertain stream as astream of uncertain values; each given by a probability distribution among the domain of thesensor values. Continuous probabilistic sum queries maintain the probability distribution ofthe sum of possible sensor values actually derived from the streaming environment.

Efficient relay deployment for controlling connectivity in delay tolerant mobile networks,Zhiyu Wang; Mario A Nascimento; Mike H MacGregor,Abstract In mobile networks; node movements may lead to a situation called networkpartition where an end-to-end path may never exist because the network is divided intoseveral isolated subnetworks. Deploying stationary relays introduces new transmissionopportunities leading to the improvement of network connectivity and performance. Themajority of the proposed solutions concentrated on deploying the minimum number of relaysin the network. However; relay deployment should also be resilient regarding relay nodefailures. In this paper; we show how the relay deployment problem can be modelled as a k-element connectivity problem in which multiple relay-disjoint paths are deployed to connectisolated subnetworks. To solve this problem; we present three heuristic algorithms targetingat finding the minimum number of relays to form k-element connected networks.

Optimal Encounter-Based Routing of Queries for Mobile Objects,Zhiyu Wang; Mario Nascimento; Mike MacGregor,Abstract—Mobile objects can be equipped with sensors enabling them to collect data; aswell as answer queries remotely and in real-time. For that; one needs to be able toeffectively route queries from a base station to the queried object in an efficient way; ie; withminimum energy-cost and/or minimum delay. Complicating factors in many domains are thatthe objects in the network are mobile and that they may not form a single connectedcomponent at all times. In this paper we take advantage of periodically repeated encounters;where an encounter is defined as a time-period long enough so that sensors cancommunicate with each other.

Learning-based Routing in Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks,Fatemah Kazemeyni; Mario A Nascimento; Ilangko Balasingham; Olaf Owe; Einar Broch Johnsen,Abstract. Limited energy supply is a chief concern when dealing with wireless sensornetworks (WSNs). Thus; among other issues; routing protocols for WSNs should bedesigned with the goal of being energy efficient in the first place. For static networks this isalready a challenge; given that different domains and application requirements lead todifferent constraints; and it becomes an even more complex problem when nodes in theWSNs are mobile. In this paper we address this very problem and propose centralized anddecentralized routing techniques that are help prolong the nodes lifespan. The main idea isto explore the movement patterns of the nodes; through simple but effective learning; inorder to use the most effective and less costly routing paths. Our experiments; using a realdataset; show that our proposed decentralized approach is twice as more energy-efficient …,*,2012,*
A Review of the Enviro-Net Project,Gilberto Z Pastorello; G Arturo Sanchez-Azofeifa; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract: Ecosystems monitoring is essential to properly understand their development andthe effects of events; both climatological and anthropological in nature. The amount of dataused in these assessments is increasing at very high rates. This is due to increasingavailability of sensing systems and the development of new techniques to analyze sensordata. The Enviro-Net Project encompasses several of such sensor system deploymentsacross five countries in the Americas. These deployments use a few different ground-basedsensor systems; installed at different heights monitoring the conditions in tropical dry forestsover long periods of time. This paper presents our experience in deploying and maintainingthese systems; retrieving and pre-processing the data; and describes the Web portaldeveloped to help with data management; visualization and analysis.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1106.5489,2011,*

Signature Files,Mario A Nascimento,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,*,2009,*
Processing Spatiotemporal Data Map Queries with Redundancy Removal in Sensor Networks,Alexandru Coman; Mario Nascimento; Joerg Sander,Abstract Wireless sensor networks are made of autonomous devices that are able to collectinformation; store it; process it and share it with other devices. Such framework can be usedto efficiently query spatiotemporal data; eg; for monitoring humidity and temperature levelsacross a wide geographical region. Typical spatiotemporal region queries require theanswers of only the subset of the network nodes that fall into the spatial area of the query. Ifthe network is redundant in the sense that nodes' measurements can be substituted by thoseof other nodes with a certain degree of confidence; then only a much smaller subset ofnodes may be sufficient to answer the query at a much lower energy cost. In this paper weinvestigate how to take advantage of such data redundancy; and we propose threetechniques to process spatiotemporal region queries under these conditions. We show …,*,2005,*

of Proceedings: Proceedings 2004 VLDB Conference: The 30th International Conference on Very Large Databases (VLDB),Martin Theobald; Gerhard Weikum; Ralf Schenkel,Abstract/Description: Top-k queries based on ranking elements of multidimensional datasetsare a fundamental building block for many kinds of information discovery. The best knowngeneral-purpose algo-rithm for evaluating top-k queries is Fagin's threshold algorithm (TA).Since the user's goal behind top-k queries is to identify one or a few relevant and novel dataitems; it is intriguing to use approximative variants of TA to reduce run-time costs. This paperintroduces a family of approximative top-k algorithms based on probabilistic arguments.When scanning index lists of the underlying multidimensional data space in descendingorder of local scores; various forms of convolution and derived bounds are employed topredict when it is safe; with high probability; to drop candidate items and to prune the indexscans.

Efficient indexing of high dimensional normalized histograms,Alexandru Coman; Jörg Sander; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract This paper addresses the problem of indexing high dimensional normalizedhistogram data; ie; D-dimensional feature vectors H where ∑^D_i=1H_i=1. These are oftenused as representations for multimedia objects in order to facilitate similarity queryprocessing. By analyzing properties that are induced by the above constraint and that do nothold in general multi-dimensional spaces we design a new split policy. We show that theperformance of similarity queries for normalized histogram data can be significantlyimproved by exploiting such properties within a simple indexing framework. We are able toprocess nearest-neighbor queries up to 10 times faster than the SR-tree and 3 times fasterthan the A-tree.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2003,*

Robust color-based image retrieval using bipartite graphs,Mario A Nascimento; Shengiiu Wang,The global color histogram is a well-known as a simple and often effective way to performcolor-based image retrieval. However; it lacks information about the location of the imagecolors. While on the one hand the use of a grid of cells superimposed on the images and theuse of local color histograms for each such cell improves retrieval; in the sense that somenotion of color location is taken into account; on the other hand retrieval now becomessensitive to image rotation and translation. In this short paper we present a new way tomodel image similarity; also using colors and a superimposing grid; via bipartite graphs.

A stratum based approach to access degenerate temporal relations,Mario Nascimento,We present an approach which yields efficient access to degenerate temporal relations; ie;temporal relations where valid time behaves as transaction time. The approach is built on astratum between the application and the DBMS and transforms a temporal relation into twotemporal relations. Access to the data is accomplished through two standard B+-trees (otherindices are optional). Such B+-trees have trivially specialized node split policies; yielding ahigh node utilization ratio. In some existing DBMSs; eg; Oracle's; such specialization isobtained at the expense of setting a single parameter when creating the indices. Wecompare the proposed approach; which we name 25; to the Monotonic B+-tree (Elmasri elal; 1992). For intersection queries; in all but one of the several investigated scenarios; 25provided at least comparable query processing time.

Several algorithms have been implemented in thepast to generate static spatial (point or rectangular) data; for instance; following a predefineddistribution in the workspace. However; by introducing motion; and thus temporal evolutionin spatial object definition; generating synthetic data tends to be a complex problem.

A simple approach to improve the abstraction level of object representation,Clenio F Salviano; Mario A Nascimento; Murat M Tanik,Abstract The management of complexity is an essential problem in software developmentand abstraction is one of the best mechanisms dealing with complexity. In order to increaseproductivity in software development; we should provide formal notation to support high-level abstractions. In this way; the semantic gap between the designers' conceptual modeland the execution model is diminished. This article describes an approach to improve theabstraction level of encapsulation. This approach supports the expression of the classinterface as data and functions. Although each one of these constructs (encapsulation; andinterface as data and functions) is provided by most programming languages; thecombination of both for the same attribute is not provided. In addition; the level of abstractionof data representation is increased allowing partial automation of its implementation.,*,1996,*

Weinvestigate the feasibility and practicality of translating TRACE specifications into Prologprograms; keeping a TRACE-like format; in such a way that can actually be executed.Besides exercising the specification before any implementation; we can run both the actualimplementation and the TRACE specification and then verify whether the implementationmatches the specification.

Thus far; we have not seen much been done to design benchmarks to evaluateindexing structures for TDBs though. The goal in this paper is to provide a framework tobenchmark indexing structures/algorithms for TBDs.

A Multimedia Application to Support Professionals in an Environmentally Responsible Building Design Process,MAP Nascimento; SD Francisco; LCL Souza; ANR Silva,ABSTRACT One of the problems faced by the design professionals in trying to incorporatethermal and acoustic concerns when designing a building is the quantity and diversity ofbuilding materials that can be applied to improve a poor indoor environment and; in manycases; to later reduce energy consumption. The large amount of information on buildingmaterials usually provided as documents makes it almost impossible to the designer tocompare products. In the light of the stated facts; the objective of this work was thedevelopment of a multimedia application; which was thought as a module of a morecomprehensive system able to support professionals in an environmentally responsiblebuilding design process. The application takes advantage of the ability of computers tohandle texts; images; sounds and movies to introduce several building materials and their …,*,*,*

Information Filtering Meets Mobility1,Mario A Nascimento,ABSTRACT The underlying premise in this position paper is that mobility patterns have beenrelatively underexplored from a data management perspective. More specifically; we discusshow to explore mobility patterns from a large set of users in order to allow proactivediscovery and/or suggestion of spatiotemporal events of interest to users. Towards that goal;and considering the semantics of such an application in particular; we suggest three lines ofwork:(1) how to cluster trajectories;(2) how to find a representative trajectory for trajectoryclusters; and (3) how to index trajectories.,NSF Workshop on Social Networks and Mobility in the Cloud,*,*

RDBMS Support for Efficient Indexing of Historical Spatio-Temporal Point Data,Daniel Mallett; Mario A Nascimento; Viorica Botea; Joerg Sander,Abstract Despite pressing need; current RDBMS support for spatiotemporal data is limitedand inadequate; and most existing spatiotemporal access methods cannot be readilyintegrated into an RDBMS. This paper proposes SPIT; an adaptive technique forspatiotemporal storage; indexing and query support that can be fully integrated within any off-the-shelf RDBMS. We initially propose a cost model that assumes a uniform data distributionfor determining an optimal partitioning of the data space in terms of query processing time.We then use this model as a basis for a heuristic method for partitioning the data spacewithout making any assumption about the data distribution. Using Oracle as ourimplementation platform with both real and synthetic datasets; we show that SPIT is robustand significantly outperforms other RDBMS-based options for managing historical …,History,*,*
