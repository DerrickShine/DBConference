Spatial keyword query processing: an experimental evaluation,Lisi Chen; Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen; Dingming Wu,Abstract Geo-textual indices play an important role in spatial keyword querying. The existinggeo-textual indices have not been compared systematically under the same experimentalframework. This makes it difficult to determine which indexing technique best supportsspecific functionality. We provide an all-around survey of 12 state-of-the-art geo-textualindices. We propose a benchmark that enables the comparison of the spatial keyword queryperformance. We also report on the findings obtained when applying the benchmark to theindices; thus uncovering new insights that may guide index selection as well as furtherresearch.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,179
Spatial Keyword Querying,Xin Cao; Lisi Chen; Gao Cong; Christian Jensen; Qiang Qu; Anders Skovsgaard; Dingming Wu; Man Yiu,Abstract The web is increasingly being used by mobile users. In addition; it is increasinglybecoming possible to accurately geo-position mobile users and web content. Thisdevelopment gives prominence to spatial web data management. Specifically; a spatialkeyword query takes a user location and user-supplied keywords as arguments and returnsweb objects that are spatially and textually relevant to these arguments. This paper reviewsrecent results by the authors that aim to achieve spatial keyword querying functionality that iseasy to use; relevant to users; and can be supported efficiently. The paper covers differentkinds of functionality as well as the ideas underlying their definition.,Conceptual Modeling,2012,130
Keyword-aware optimal route search,Xin Cao; Lisi Chen; Gao Cong; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract Identifying a preferable route is an important problem that finds applications in mapservices. When a user plans a trip within a city; the user may want to find" a most popularroute such that it passes by shopping mall; restaurant; and pub; and the travel time to andfrom his hotel is within 4 hours." However; none of the algorithms in the existing work onroute planning can be used to answer such queries. Motivated by this; we define theproblem of keyword-aware optimal route query; denoted by KOR; which is to find an optimalroute such that it covers a set of user-specified keywords; a specified budget constraint issatisfied; and an objective score of the route is optimal. The problem of answering KORqueries is NP-hard. We devise an approximation algorithm OSScaling with provableapproximation bounds. Based on this algorithm; another more efficient approximation …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,55
Temporal spatial-keyword top-k publish/subscribe,Lisi Chen; Gao Cong; Xin Cao; Kian-Lee Tan,Massive amount of data that are geo-tagged and associated with text information are beinggenerated at an unprecedented scale. These geo-textual data cover a wide range of topics.Users are interested in receiving up-to-date tweets such that their locations are close to auser specified location and their texts are interesting to users. For example; a user may wantto be updated with tweets near her home on the topic “food poisoning vomiting.” Weconsider the Temporal Spatial-Keyword Top-k Subscription (TaSK) query. Given a TaSKquery; we continuously maintain up-to-date top-k most relevant results over a stream of geo-textual objects (eg; geo-tagged Tweets) for the query. The TaSK query takes into accounttext relevance; spatial proximity; and recency of geo-textual objects in evaluating itsrelevance with a geo-textual object.

An efficient query indexing mechanism for filtering geo-textual data,Lisi Chen; Gao Cong; Xin Cao,Abstract Massive amount of data that are geo-tagged and associated with text informationare being generated at an unprecedented scale. Users may want to be notified of interestinggeo-textual objects during a period of time. For example; a user may want to be informedwhen tweets containing term" garage sale" are posted within 5 km of the user's home in thenext 72 hours. In this paper; for the first time we study the problem of matching a stream ofincoming Boolean Range Continuous queries over a stream of incoming geo-textual objectsin real time. We develop a new system for addressing the problem. In particular; we proposea hybrid index; called IQ-tree; and novel cost models for managing a stream of incomingBoolean Range Continuous queries. We also propose algorithms for matching the querieswith incoming geo-textual objects based on the index.

Diversity-aware top-k publish/subscribe for text stream,Lisi Chen; Gao Cong,Abstract Massive amount of text data are being generated by a huge number of web users atan unprecedented scale. These data cover a wide range of topics. Users are interested inreceiving a few up-to-date representative documents (eg; tweets) that can provide them witha wide coverage of different aspects of their query topics. To address the problem; weconsider the Diversity-Aware Top-k Subscription (DAS) query. Given a DAS query; wecontinuously maintain an up-to-date result set that contains k most recently returneddocuments over a text stream for the query. The DAS query takes into account textrelevance; document recency; and result diversity. We propose a novel solution to efficientlyprocessing a large number of DAS queries over a stream of documents. We demonstrate theefficiency of our approach on real-world dataset and the experimental results show that …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,23
Collective travel planning in spatial networks,Shuo Shang; Lisi Chen; Zhewei Wei; Christian S Jensen; Ji-Rong Wen; Panos Kalnis,Travel planning and recommendation are important aspects of transportation. We proposeand investigate a novel Collective Travel Planning (CTP) query that finds the lowest-costroute connecting multiple sources and a destination; via at most $ k $ meeting points. Whenmultiple travelers target the same destination (eg; a stadium or a theater); they may want toassemble at meeting points and then go together to the destination by public transport toreduce their global travel cost (eg; energy; money; or greenhouse-gas emissions). This typeof functionality holds the potential to bring significant benefits to society and theenvironment; such as reducing energy consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions;enabling smarter and greener transportation; and reducing traffic congestions. The CTPquery is Max SNP-hard. To compute the query efficiently; we develop two algorithms …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,19
KORS: Keyword-aware optimal route search system,Xin Cao; Lisi Chen; Gao Cong; Jihong Guan; Nhan-Tue Phan; Xiaokui Xiao,We present the Keyword-aware Optimal Route Search System (KORS); which efficientlyanswers the KOR queries. A KOR query is to find a route such that it covers a set of user-specified keywords; a specified budget constraint is satisfied; and an objective score of theroute is optimized. Consider a tourist who wants to spend a day exploring a city. The usermay issue the following KOR query:“find the most popular route such that it passes byshopping mall; restaurant; and pub; and the travel time to and from her hotel is within 4hours.” KORS provides browser-based interfaces for desktop and laptop computers andprovides a client application for mobile devices as well. The interfaces and the client enableusers to formulate queries and view the query results on a map. Queries are then sent to theserver for processing by the HTTP post operation. Since answering a KOR query is NP …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,13
Searching trajectories by regions of interest,Shuo Shang; Lisi Chen; Christian S Jensen; Ji-Rong Wen; Panos Kalnis,With the increasing availability of moving-object tracking data; trajectory search isincreasingly important. We propose and investigate a novel query type named trajectorysearch by regions of interest (TSR query). Given an argument set of trajectories; a TSRquery takes a set of regions of interest as a parameter and returns the trajectory in theargument set with the highest spatial-density correlation to the query regions. This type ofquery is useful in many popular applications such as trip planning and recommendation;and location based services in general. TSR query processing faces three challenges: howto model the spatial-density correlation between query regions and data trajectories; how toeffectively prune the search space; and how to effectively schedule multiple so-called querysources. To tackle these challenges; a series of new metrics are defined to model spatial …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,8

Topic exploration in spatio-temporal document collections,Kaiqi Zhao; Lisi Chen; Gao Cong,Abstract Huge amounts of data with both spatial and temporal information (eg; geo-taggedtweets) are being generated; and are often used to share and spread personal updates;spontaneous ideas; and breaking news. We refer to such data as spatio-temporaldocuments. It is of great interest to explore topics in a collection of spatio-temporaldocuments. In this paper; we study the problem of efficiently mining topics from spatio-temporal documents within a user specified bounded region and timespan; to provide userswith insights about events; trends; and public concerns within the specified region and timeperiod. We propose a novel algorithm that is able to efficiently combine two pre-trained topicmodels learnt from two document sets with a bounded error; based on which we develop anefficient approach to mining topics from a large number of spatio-temporal documents …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,6
Efficient processing of location-aware group preference queries,Miao Li; Lisi Chen; Gao Cong; Yu Gu; Ge Yu,Abstract With the proliferation of geo-positioning techniques that enable users to acquiretheir geographical positions; there has been increasing popularity of online location-basedservices. This development has generated a large volume of points of interest labeled withcategory features (eg; hotel; resort; stores; stations; and tourist attractions). It givesprominence to various types of spatial-keyword queries; which are employed to providefundamental querying functionality for location-based services. We study the Location-awareGroup Preference (LGP) query that aims to find a destination place for a group of users. Thegroup of users want to go to a place labeled with a specified category feature (eg; hotel)together; and each of them has a location and a set of additional preferences. It is expectedthat the result place of the query belongs to the specified category feature; and it is close …,Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2016,3
Trajectory similarity join in spatial networks,Shuo Shang; Lisi Chen; Zhewei Wei; Christian S Jensen; Kai Zheng; Panos Kalnis,Abstract The matching of similar pairs of objects; called similarity join; is fundamentalfunctionality in data management. We consider the case of trajectory similarity join (TS-Join);where the objects are trajectories of vehicles moving in road networks. Thus; given two setsof trajectories and a threshold θ; the TS-Join returns all pairs of trajectories from the two setswith similarity above θ. This join targets applications such as trajectory near-duplicatedetection; data cleaning; ridesharing recommendation; and traffic congestion prediction.With these applications in mind; we provide a purposeful definition of similarity. To enableefficient TS-Join processing on large sets of trajectories; we develop search space pruningtechniques and take into account the parallel processing capabilities of modern processors.Specifically; we present a two-phase divide-and-conquer algorithm.

Dynamic shortest path monitoring in spatial networks,Shuo Shang; Lisi Chen; Zhe-Wei Wei; Dan-Huai Guo; Ji-Rong Wen,Abstract With the increasing availability of real-time traffic information; dynamic spatialnetworks are pervasive nowadays and path planning in dynamic spatial networks becomesan important issue. In this light; we propose and investigate a novel problem of dynamicallymonitoring shortest paths in spatial networks (DSPM query). When a traveler aims to adestination; his/her shortest path to the destination may change due to two reasons: 1) thetravel costs of some edges have been updated and 2) the traveler deviates from the pre-planned path. Our target is to accelerate the shortest path computing in dynamic spatialnetworks; and we believe that this study may be useful in many mobile applications; such asroute planning and recommendation; car navigation and tracking; and location-basedservices in general. This problem is challenging due to two reasons: 1) how to maintain …,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2016,2
Location-Based Top-k Term Querying over Sliding Window,Ying Xu; Lisi Chen; Bin Yao; Shuo Shang; Shunzhi Zhu; Kai Zheng; Fang Li,Abstract In part due to the proliferation of GPS-equipped mobile devices; massive svolumesof geo-tagged streaming text messages are becoming available on social media. It is ofgreat interest to discover most frequent nearby terms from such tremendous stream data. Inthis paper; we present novel indexing; updating; and query processing techniques that arecapable of discovering top-k locally popular nearby terms over a sliding window.Specifically; given a query location and a set of geo-tagged messages within a slidingwindow; we study the problem of searching for the top-k terms by considering both the termfrequency and the proximities between the messages containing the term and the querylocation.

Discovering Pollution Sources and Propagation Patterns in Urban Area,Xiucheng Li; Yun Cheng; Gao Cong; Lisi Chen,Abstract Air quality is one of the most important environmental concerns in the world; and ithas deteriorated substantially over the past years in many countries. For example; ChineseAcademy of Social Sciences reports that the problem of haze and fog in China is hitting arecord level; and China is currently suffering from the worst air pollution. Among the variouscausal factors of air quality; particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less (ie;PM 2.5) is a very important factor; governments and people are increasingly concerned withthe concentration of PM 2.5. In many cities; stations for monitoring PM 2.5 concentrationhave been built by governments or companies to monitor urban air quality. Apart frommonitoring; there is a rising demand for finding pollution sources of PM 2.5 and discoveringthe transmission of PM 2.5 based on the data from PM $ _ {2.5} $ monitoring stations …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2017,*

Towards personalized maps: mining user preferences from geo-textual data,Kaiqi Zhao; Yiding Liu; Quan Yuan; Lisi Chen; Zhida Chen; Gao Cong,Abstract Rich geo-textual data is available online and the data keeps increasing at a highspeed. We propose two user behavior models to learn several types of user preferencesfrom geo-textual data; and a prototype system on top of the user preference models formining and search geo-textual data (called PreMiner) to support personalized maps.Different from existing recommender systems and data analysis systems; PreMiner highlypersonalizes user experience on maps and supports several applications; including usermobility & interests mining; opinion mining in regions; user recommendation; point-of-interest recommendation; and querying and subscribing on geo-textual data.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,*
Efficient Computation of Measurements of Correlated Patterns in Uncertain Data,Lisi Chen; Shengfei Shi; Jing Lv,Abstract One of the most important tasks in data mining is to discover associations andcorrelations among items in a huge database. In recent years; some studies have beenconducted to find a more accurate measure to describe correlations between items. It hasbeen proved that the newly developed measures of all-confidence and bond perform muchbetter in reflecting the true correlation relationship than just using support and confidence incategorical database. Hence; several efficient algorithms have been proposed to minecorrelated patterns based on all-confidence and bond. However; as the data uncertaintybecome increasingly prevalent in various kinds of real-world applications; we need a brandnew method to mine the true correlations in uncertain datasets with high efficiency andaccuracy. In this paper; we propose effective methods based on dynamic programming to …,Advanced Data Mining and Applications,2011,*
