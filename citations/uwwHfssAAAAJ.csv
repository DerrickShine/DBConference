Linking data to ontologies,Antonella Poggi; Domenico Lembo; Diego Calvanese; Giuseppe De Giacomo; Maurizio Lenzerini; Riccardo Rosati,Abstract Many organizations nowadays face the problem of accessing existing data sourcesby means of flexible mechanisms that are both powerful and efficient. Ontologies are widelyconsidered as a suitable formal tool for sophisticated data access. The ontology expressesthe domain of interest of the information system at a high level of abstraction; and therelationship between data at the sources and instances of concepts and roles in theontology is expressed by means of mappings. In this paper we present a solution to theproblem of designing effective systems for ontology-based data access. Our solution isbased on three main ingredients. First; we present a new ontology language; based onDescription Logics; that is particularly suited to reason with large amounts of instances. Thesecond ingredient is a novel mapping language that is able to deal with the so-called …,*,2008,624

The MASTRO system for ontology-based data access,Diego Calvanese; Giuseppe De Giacomo; Domenico Lembo; Maurizio Lenzerini; Antonella Poggi; Mariano Rodriguez-Muro; Riccardo Rosati; Marco Ruzzi; Domenico Fabio Savo,Abstract In this paper we present MASTRO; a Java tool for ontology-based data access(OBDA) developed at Sapienza Università di Roma and at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano. MASTRO manages OBDA systems in which the ontology is specified in DL-Lite A;id; a logic of the DL-Lite family of tractable Description Logics specifically tailored to ontology-based data access; and is connected to external JDBC enabled data management systemsthrough semantic mappings that associate SQL queries over the external data to theelements of the ontology. Advanced forms of integrity constraints; which turned out to be veryuseful in practical applications; are also enabled over the ontologies. Optimized algorithmsfor answering expressive queries are provided; as well as features for intensional reasoningand consistency checking.

Ontologies and databases: The DL-Lite approach,Diego Calvanese; Giuseppe De Giacomo; Domenico Lembo; Maurizio Lenzerini; Antonella Poggi; Mariano Rodriguez-Muro; Riccardo Rosati,Abstract Ontologies provide a conceptualization of a domain of interest. Nowadays; they aretypically represented in terms of Description Logics (DLs); and are seen as the keytechnology used to describe the semantics of information at various sites. The idea of usingontologies as a conceptual view over data repositories is becoming more and more popular;but for it to become widespread in standard applications; it is fundamental that theconceptual layer through which the underlying data layer is accessed does not introduce asignificant overhead in dealing with the data. Based on these observations; in recent years afamily of DLs; called DL-Lite; has been proposed; which is specifically tailored to capturebasic ontology and conceptual data modeling languages; while keeping low complexity ofreasoning and of answering complex queries; in particular when the complexity is …,Reasoning Web.

Ontology-based Database Access.,Diego Calvanese; Giuseppe De Giacomo; Domenico Lembo; Maurizio Lenzerini; Antonella Poggi; Riccardo Rosati,Abstract. One of the most interesting usages of shared conceptualizations is ontology-baseddata access. That is; to the usual data layer of an information system we superimpose aconceptual layer to be exported to the client. Such a layer allows the client to have aconceptual view of the information in the system; which abstracts away from how suchinformation is maintained in the data layer of the system itself. While ontologies are the bestcandidates for realizing the conceptual layer; relational DBMSs are natural candidates forthe management of the data layer. The need of efficiently processing large amounts of datarequires ontologies to be expressed in a suitable fragment of OWL: the fragment shouldallow; on the one hand; for modeling the kind of intensional knowledge needed in real-worldapplications; and; on the other hand; for delegating to a relational DBMS the part of …,SEBD,2007,86

On database query languages for K-relations,Floris Geerts; Antonella Poggi,Abstract The relational model has recently been extended to so-called K-relations in whichtuples are assigned a unique value in a semiring K. A query language; denoted by RA K+;similar to the classical positive relational algebra; allows for the querying of K-relations. Inthis paper; we define more expressive query languages for K-relations that extend RA K+with the difference and constant annotations operations on annotated tuples. The latter arenatural extensions of the duplicate elimination operator of the relational algebra on bags.We investigate conditions on semirings under which these operations can be added to RAK+ in a natural way; and establish basic properties of the resulting query languages.Moreover; we show how the provenance semiring of Green et al. can be extended to recordprovenance of data in the presence of difference and constant annotations.

On instance-level update and erasure in description logic ontologies,Giuseppe De Giacomo; Maurizio Lenzerini; Antonella Poggi; Riccardo Rosati,Abstract A Description Logic (DL) ontology is constituted by two components; a TBox thatexpresses general knowledge about the concepts and their relationships; and an ABox thatdescribes the properties of individuals that are instances of concepts. We address theproblem of how to deal with changes to a DL ontology; when these changes affect only theABox; ie when the TBox is considered invariant. We consider two basic changes; namelyinstance-level update and instance-level erasure; roughly corresponding to the addition andthe deletion of a set of facts involving individuals. We characterize the semantics of instance-level update and erasure on the basis of the approaches proposed by Winslett and byKatsuno and Mendelzon. Interestingly; DLs are typically not closed with respect to instance-level update and erasure; in the sense that the set of models corresponding to the …,Journal of Logic and Computation,2008,63
OntoPIM: how to rely on a personal ontology for Personal Information Management,Vivi Katifori; Antonella Poggi; Monica Scannapieco; Tiziana Catarci; Yannis Ioannidis,Nowadays; our personal computer contains a huge amount of information; that is stored inseveral different formats; including emails; pictures; text documents; media file; addressbooks; etc. When we need to look for some information; one possibility is to use a keyword-based search tool; such as Google Desktop [1]. We then get several links to documents;mails; databases; etc. that relate to our search but are often too scattered in order to let useasily obtain the information we are looking for; even if this information is actually containedin our desktop. In this paper; we propose a framework for Personal Information Management(PIM); called OntoPIM; that relies on the use of a Personal Ontology; that describes user'sdomain of interest in terms of objects; classes and relations. The ontology is personal in thesense that it reflects the user view of her domain (s) of interest.

Optimizing query rewriting in ontology-based data access,Floriana Di Pinto; Domenico Lembo; Maurizio Lenzerini; Riccardo Mancini; Antonella Poggi; Riccardo Rosati; Marco Ruzzi; Domenico Fabio Savo,Abstract In ontology-based data access (OBDA); an ontology is connected to autonomous;and generally pre-existing; data repositories through mappings; so as to provide a high-level; conceptual view over such data. User queries are posed over the ontology; andanswers are computed by reasoning both on the ontology and the mappings. Queryanswering in OBDA systems is typically performed through a query rewriting approachwhich is divided into two steps:(i) the query is rewritten with respect to the ontology (ontologyrewriting of the query);(ii) the query thus obtained is then reformulated over the databaseschema using the mapping assertions (mapping rewriting of the query). In this paper wepresent a new approach to the optimization of query rewriting in OBDA.

Complexity and composition of synthesized web services,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Wouter Gelade; Frank Neven; Antonella Poggi,Abstract The paper investigates fundamental decision problems and composition synthesisfor Web services commonly found in practice. We propose a notion of synthesized Webservices (ASTs) to specify the behaviors of the services. Upon receiving a sequence of inputmessages; an AST issues multiple queries to a database and generates actions; in parallel;it produces external messages and database updates by synthesizing the actions parallellygenerated. In contrast to previous models for Web services; ASTs advocate parallelprocessing and (deterministic) synthesis of actions. We classify ASTs based on what queriesan AST can issue; how the synthesis of actions is expressed; and whether unbounded inputsequences are allowed in a single interaction session. We show that the behaviors of Webservices supported by various prior models; data-driven or not; can be specified by …,Proceedings of the twenty-seventh ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2008,34
Personal ontology creation and visualization for a personal interaction management system,Akrivi Katifori; Costas Vassilakis; Ilias Daradimos; George Lepouras; Yannis Ioannidis; Alan Dix; Antonella Poggi; Tiziana Catarci,ABSTRACT Ontologies offer a flexible and expressive layer of abstraction; very useful forcapturing the semantics of information repositories and facilitating their retrieval either by theuser or by the system to support user tasks. This work presents an ontology-based userprofiler; in the context of a Personal Interaction Management System (PIMS). The profiler;based on an ontology of the users' domain; enables them to create their personal ontologyby initially choosing one of the available template ontologies as a starting point; which theysubsequently populate and customize. The profiler employs a web interface which allowsusers to populate their personal ontology through forms; hiding ontology complexities andpeculiarities. Forms are dynamically generated through ontology views; which are specifiedby ontology designers.,Workshop on Personal Information Management; in CHI,2008,32

In this paper we (i) illustrate the methodology used to collect the userrequirements for the emergency management system developed in the European researchproject WORKPAD; and (ii) describe the WORKPAD high level architecture stemming fromsuch requirements. Specifically; the methodology is applied in the context of Regional CivilProtection of Calabria (Italy) and is used as basis to provide more general user requirementsfor emergency management systems.,Proc. 4th International Conference on Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management (ISCRAM 2007),2007,32
Ontopim: From personal information management to task information management,George Lepouras; Alan Dix; Akrivi Katifori; Titziana Catarci; Benjamin Habegger; Antonella Poggi; Yannis Ioannidis,Personal Information Management (PIM) aims to support users in the collection; storage andretrieval of their personal information. In such a framework the focus is mainly on how betterto handle the information collected. Task Information Management (TIM) on the other handadopts a more usercentric view and aims to support users in performing their tasks. Possibleways of achieving this are to automatically find data users need in order to perform a task; toautomate the execution of tasks and the synthesis of new more abstract tasks by identifyingtasks users carry out often. PIM and TIM can be seen as complimentary since an efficientorganization of personal information can help in the discovery of data relevant to a task. Tothis end; it is necessary to adopt a holistic approach in the design and implementation of aTask Information Management System.,Personal Information Management: Now That We are Talking; What Are We Learning,2006,29

Inprevious work we have explored the issue of managing personal data by enriching themwith semantics according to a Personal Ontology; ie a user-tailored description of herdomain of interest. Moreover; we have proposed a task specification language and a top-down approach to task inference; where the user specifies main aspects of the tasks usingforms of declarative scripting. Recently; we have addressed new challenging issues relatedto TIM user's task inference. More precisely; the first main contribution of this paper is theinvestigation of task inference theoretical issues. In particular; we show how the use of the …,*,2007,27
XML data integration with identification,Antonella Poggi; Serge Abiteboul,Abstract Data integration is the problem of combining data residing at different sources; andproviding the user with a virtual view; called global schema; which is independent from themodel and the physical origin of the sources. Whereas many data integration systems andtheoretical works have been proposed for relational data; not much investigation has beenfocused yet on XML data integration. Our goal is therefore to address some of its relatedissues. In particular; we highlight two major issues that emerge in the XML context:(i) theglobal schema may be characterized by a set of constraints; expressed by means of a DTDand XML integrity constraints;(ii) the concept of node identity requires to introduce semanticcriteria to identify nodes coming from different sources.

Mastro manages OBDA systems in which theontology is specified in a logic of the DL-Lite family of Description Logics specifically tailoredto ontology-based data access; and is connected to external data management systemsthrough semantic mappings that associate SQL queries over the external data to theelements of the ontology. Advanced forms of integrity constraints; which turned out to be veryuseful in practical applications; are also enabled over the ontologies. Optimized algorithmsfor answering expressive queries are provided; as well as features for intensional reasoningand consistency checking.

Ontology representation & reasoning,Maurizio Lenzerini; Diego Milano; Antonella Poggi,It is widely accepted to consider an ontology as a conceptualization of a domain of interest;that can be used in several ways to model; analyze and reason upon the domain. Obviously;any conceptualization of a certain domain has to be represented in terms of a well-definedlanguage; and; once such a representation is available; there ought to be well-foundedmethods for reasoning upon it; ie; for analyzing the representation; and drawing interestingconclusions about it.

Structure everything,Tiziana Catarci; Luna Dong; Alon Halevy; Antonella Poggi,The availability of vast amounts of information on the Internet and the sharp decrease in thecost of digital storage has enabled today's desktops to become personal informationarchives. Desktops contain collections of work-and hobbyrelated data as well as richcollections of personal multimedia files. However; the typical lack of structure of one'sdesktop data makes it difficult for the user to easily search and benefit from the information itcontains.

Intelligent user task oriented systems,Tiziana Catarci; Benjamin Habegger; Antonella Poggi,Most existing human-computer interfaces are now based on the WIMP (Windows; Icons;Menus; Pointers) paradigm and on the desktop metaphor. Each application is targetedtowards editing one specific type of “document”. Current desktop oriented systems proposea mostly disconnected set of generic tools (word processor; e-mail reader; drawing tool; CDburning application; etc.). In such a setting; a user which is executing a specific task (egmaking a CD from a set of files) will likely use more than one of these tools. The fact that theyare running on one system without being connected leads to awkward situations such as theuser reentering or copying data between applications. Furthermore; the same user is verylikely to run multiple times the same task and often; she will do this in a similar manner. Forexample; a music fan will likely find himself burning more than one music CD. Having a …,Personal Information Management: Now That We’re Talking; What Are We Learning?,2006,12
Ontology-based data access with MASTRO.,Antonella Poggi; Marco Ruzzi,In several areas; such as Enterprise Application Integration; Data Integration [5]; and theSemantic Web [4]; clients need to access a shared conceptualization of the intensional levelof the application domain in terms to specify the access to services exported by the system.Ontologies are nowadays considered as the ideal formal tool to provide such a sharedconceptualization. Indeed; one of their most interesting usages is ontology-based dataaccess; where; on top of the usual data layer of an information system; a conceptual layer issuperimposed; allowing the client to abstract away from how the information is actuallymaintained in the data layer.

The process of mapping discovery is complex and error prone; it cannot befully automated; so user input is necessary. This paper presents SCIA; a system that assistsusers in creating executable mappings between a source schema and a target schema byautomating simple matches and finding critical points where user input is both necessaryand maximally useful. SCIA finds critical points by using path contexts together with acombination of multiple matching algorithms. SCIA also helps users; when a critical pointoccurs; by asking them specific questions with sufficient context and making suggestions foradding semantic information to data transformation; such as join and grouping conditions.SCIA handles complex mappings involving n-to-m matches with semantic functions and …,International Workshop on Semantic Data and Service Integration; SDSI 2007,2007,9
Towards inferring ratings from user behavior in BitTorrent communities,Róbert Ormándi; István Hegedus; Kornél Csernai; Márk Jelasity,Peer-to-peer file-sharing has been increasingly popular in the last decade. In most cases file-sharing communities provide only minimal functionality; such as search and download. Extrafeatures such as recommendation are difficult to implement because users are typicallyunwilling to provide sufficient rating information for the items they download. For this reason;it would be desirable to utilize user behavior to infer implicit ratings. For example; if a userdeletes a file after downloading it; we could infer that the rating is low; or if the user isseeding the file for a long time; the rating is high. In this paper we demonstrate that it isindeed possible to infer implicit ratings from user behavior. We work with a large trace ofFilelist. org; a BitTorrent-based private community; and demonstrate that we can identify abinary like/dislike distinction over the set of files users are downloading; using dynamic …,Enabling Technologies: Infrastructures for Collaborative Enterprises (WETICE); 2010 19th IEEE International Workshop on,2010,8

Mega-Collaboration: The Inspiration and Development of an Interface for Large-Scale Disaster Response,Christine M Newlon; Mark Pfaff; Himalaya Patel; Gert-Jan de Vreede; Karl F MacDorman,ABSTRACT The need to gather and use decentralized information and resources inresponding to disasters demands an integrated interface that can support large-scalecollaboration. This paper describes the development of a collaboration tool interface. Thetool will surpass existing groupware and social networking applications; providing easyentry; categorization; and visualization of masses of critical data; the ability to form ad-hocteams with collaboration protocols for negotiated action; and agent-augmented mixed-initiative tracking and coordination of these activities. The paper reports user testing resultsconcerning the data entry interface; emergent leadership; and the directed negotiationprocess. The paper also discusses planned enhancements; including formalizedcollaboration engineering and the use of a disaster simulation test bed.,6th International Conference on Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management; May,2009,7
The WORKPAD P2P Service-Oriented Infrastructure for Emergency Management,Tiziana Catarci; Massimiliano De Leoni; Fabio De Rosa; Massimo Mecella; Antonella Poggi; Schahram Dustdar; Lukasz Juszczyk; Hong Linh Truong,Abstract In this paper; we present the architecture of the research project WORKPAD 1. Thisproject aims at designing and developing an innovative service-oriented softwareinfrastructure for supporting collaborative work of human operators in emergency/disasterscenarios. In such scenarios; different teams; belonging to different organizations; need tocollaborate with one other; each team member is equipped with handheld devices (PDAs)and communication technologies; and should carry on specific tasks. In such a case we canconsider the whole team as carrying on a process; and the different teams collaboratethrough the “interleaving” of all the different processes. Each team is supported by someback-end centres; which need to cooperate at an inter-organizational level.,*,2008,7
When OWL met DL-Lite...,Claudio Corona; Emma Di Pasquale; Antonella Poggi; Marco Ruzzi; Domenico Fabio Savo,Abstract. Recent research in the area of ontology representation for the Semantic Web hasled to several different language proposals. Among the others; it led to the standardization ofOWL; on one hand; and to the emergence of the DL-Lite family of Description Logics; on theother hand. These two outcomes mainly differ on their objective: while OWL aims to be astandard; and as such; it is tailored towards expressivity; the main goal of the languages inthe DL-Lite family is to allow accessing huge amount of data; by maintaining tractability; anddelegating query processing to a DBMS. In this paper we show how DL-Lite can meet OWL.Specifically; we focus on DL-LiteA; the language in the DL-Lite family that is closest to OWL;and introduce the SparSQL language; a concrete epistemic query language; inspired byboth SQL and SPARQL; that allows posing expressive tractable queries over DL-LiteA …,SWAP,2008,7
Answering Metaqueries over Hi (OWL 2 QL) Ontologies.,Maurizio Lenzerini; Lorenzo Lepore; Antonella Poggi,Abstract Hi (OWL 2 QL) is a new ontology language with the OWL 2 QL syntax and a specificsemantics designed to support metamodeling and metaquerying. In this paper weinvestigate the problem of answering metaqueries in Hi (OWL 2 QL); which are unions ofconjunctive queries with both ABox and TBox atoms. We first focus on a specific class ofontologies; called TBox-complete; where there is no uncertainty about TBox axioms; andshow that query answering in this case has the same complexity (both data and combined)as in OWL 2 QL. We then move to general ontologies and show that answering metaqueriesis coNP-complete with respect to ontology complexity; Πp 2-complete with respect tocombined complexity; and remains AC0 with respect to ABox complexity. Finally; we presentan optimized query answering algorithm that can be used for TBox-complete ontologies.,IJCAI,2016,5
A Higher-Order Semantics for Metaquerying in OWL 2 QL.,Maurizio Lenzerini; Lorenzo Lepore; Antonella Poggi,Inspired by recent work on higher-order Description Logics; we propose HOS; a newsemantics for OWL 2 QL ontologies. We then consider SPARQL queries which are legalunder the direct semantics entailment regime; we extend them with logical union; existentialvariables; and unrestricted use of variables so as to express meaningful meta-level queries.We show that both satisfiability checking and answering instance queries with metavariableshave the same ABox complexity as under direct semantics.,KR,2016,5
Real time vision based object detection from UAV aerial images: a conceptual framework,AFM Saifuddin Saif; Anton Satria Prabuwono; Zainal Rasyid Mahayuddin,Abstract In computer vision research; one of the capabilities of establishing an autonomousUAV is the detection of rigid and non-rigid object. Moving object detection with movingcameras from UAV aerial images is still an unsolved issue due to clutter and ruralbackground contained in the images; even and uneven illumination changes; static andmoving objects and motion of camera. This paper presents a conceptual framework formoving object detection with moving camera from UAV aerial images combined with theframe difference and segmentation approach together. Our focus is the human as rigid andvehicle as non rigid object detection where the camera can be mounted on the vehicle orother movable platform. It is expected that the proposed conceptual framework performs wellunder different situations for uneven environments.,FIRA RoboWorld Congress,2013,5
The On-TIME user interface,Tiziana Catarci; Raffaele Giuliano; Marco Piva; Antonella Poggi; Fabio Terella; Emanuele Tracanna,Abstract This work presents the visual user interface of the On-TIME system; a task-centeredinformation management system; whose aim is to actively participate to and support the usertasks. One of the key challenges that needs to be addressed for the success of On-TIME; isthe design of a user friendly interface. Being On-TIME based on the use of a so-calledPersonal Ontology to provide a semantic account to user's personal data; the interface hasto allow the user to easily browse the ontology. On the other hand; it has to address themanagement of tasks. This requires to both suggest tasks that the user might be willing toperform; and to support her while executing tasks. We present a typical user scenario inorder to illustrate a possible interaction with the On-TIME interface; and discuss somepreliminary user evaluation.,*,2009,5
Making Metaquerying Practical for Hi (DL− Lite R) Knowledge Bases,Maurizio Lenzerini; Lorenzo Lepore; Antonella Poggi,Abstract Hi (DL− Lite R) is a higher-order Description Logic obtained from DL− Lite R byadding metamodeling features; and is equipped with a query language that is able toexpress higher-order queries.

Task-based user-system interaction,Shah Rukh Humayoun; Antonella Poggi; Tiziana Catarci; Alan Dix,Abstract In current electronic environments; the ever-increasing amount of personalinformation; means that users focus more on managing their information rather than using itto accomplish their objectives. To overcome this problem; a user task-based interactiveenvironment is needed to help users focus on tasks they wish to perform rather thanspending more time on managing their personal information. In this paper; we present partsof our on-going work on task-based user-system interaction; which highlights the need for ashift from an information-centric to a task-centric environment. More precisely; we look intoissues relating to modeling user tasks that arise when users interact with the environment tofulfill their goals through these sets of tasks.,KI-Künstliche Intelligenz,2012,4
On BP-complete query languages on k-relations,Floris Geerts; Antonella Poggi,Abstract. The relational model has recently been extended to so-called K-relations in whichtuples are assigned a unique value in a semiring K. A query language; denoted by RA+ K;similar to the classical positive relational algebra; allows for the querying of K-relations. Westudy the completeness of RA+ K in the sense of Bancilhon and Paredaens (BP) and showthat RA+ K is; in general; not BP-complete. Faced with this incompleteness; we identify twonecessary and sufficient operators that need to be added to RA+ K to make it BP-complete:difference (−) and duplicate elimination (δ). We investigate conditions on semirings underwhich these constructs can be added in a natural way; and investigate basic properties ofour query languages.,Workshop on Logic in Databases (LID),2008,4
When DL-Lite met OWL....,Claudio Corona; Emma Di Pasquale; Antonella Poggi; Marco Ruzzi; Domenico Fabio Savo,DL-Lite is a family of Description Logics (DLs) whose aim is to capture some of the mostpopular conceptual modeling formalisms; such as Entity-Relationship model [4] and UMLclass diagrams1; while preserving the tractability of the most important reasoning tasks; suchas ontology satisfiability and query answering of arbitrary (union of) conjunctive queries(ground and not ground). More specifically; reasoning over ontologies of the DL-Lite family;is LOGSPACE in data complexity; and can be entirely delegated to a standard DBMStechnology. We refer here to DL-LiteA; the DL of the DL-Lite family that is closest to OWL 2.0.Note that DL-LiteA is in fact a fragment of OWL 2. As such; it is possible to restrict the syntaxof OWL so that it captures DL-LiteA. Because of the lack of the space; we will not discussfurther this topic. We provide an expressive query language for DL-LiteA ontologies …,OWLED,2008,3

Ontology-based data access with MASTRO (demo,Antonella Poggi; Marco Ruzzi,Abstract and the Semantic Web [4]; clients need to access the services exported by thesystem; and hence require a representation of the intensional level of the applicationdomain in terms of which they can specify the access to the exported services. One of themost interesting usages of such a shared conceptualization is ontology-based data access;where a conceptual layer is exported to the client; abstracting away from how actual data ismaintained. Therefore; an ontology-based data access system has to adress the“impedance mismatch” issue; existing between data actually present at the sources; andobjects represented at the intensional level. In this demo; we present MASTRO; an ontology-based data access system that ex-tends the QuOnto system [1] with new capabilities anduses the QuOnto engine at its core.

Using ontologies for semantic data integration,Giuseppe De Giacomo; Domenico Lembo; Maurizio Lenzerini; Antonella Poggi; Riccardo Rosati,Abstract While big data analytics is considered as one of the most important paths tocompetitive advantage of today's enterprises; data scientists spend a comparatively largeamount of time in the data preparation and data integration phase of a big data project. Thisshows that data integration is still a major challenge in IT applications. Over the past twodecades; the idea of using semantics for data integration has become increasingly crucial;and has received much attention in the AI; database; web; and data mining communities.Here; we focus on a specific paradigm for semantic data integration; called Ontology-BasedData Access (OBDA). The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of OBDA; pointing outboth the techniques that are at the basis of the paradigm; and the main challenges thatremain to be addressed.,*,2018,1
On the SPARQL Direct Semantics Entailment Regime for OWL 2 QL.,Antonella Poggi,Abstract. OWL 2 QL is the profile of OWL 2 targeted to Ontology-Based Data Access (OBDA)scenarios; where large amount of data are to be accessed and thus query answering isrequired to be especially efficient in the size of such data; namely AC0 in data complexity.On the other hand; the syntax and the semantics of the SPARQL query language for OWL 2is defined by means of the Direct Semantics Entailment Regime (DSER); which considersqueries including any assertion expressible in the language of the queried ontology; ie; bothABox atoms; TBox atoms and inequalities expressed by means of DifferentIndividualsatoms. Thus; in this paper; we investigate query answering over OWL 2 QL under DSER. Inparticular; we show that; by virtue of the restricted meaning assigned to existential variablesand union; query answering can be reduced to the evaluation of a Datalog program …,Description Logics,2016,1
How to Define Certain Answers.,Leonid Libkin,Abstract The standard way of answering queries over incomplete databases is to computecertain answers; defined as the intersection of query answers on all complete databases thatthe incomplete database represents. But is this universally accepted definition correct? Weargue that this “one-size-fitsall” definition can often lead to counterintuitive or just plainwrong results; and propose an alternative framework for defining certain answers. Wecombine three previously used approaches; based on the semantics and representationsystems; on ordering incomplete databases in terms of their informativeness; and on viewingdatabases as knowledge expressed in a logical language; to come up with a well justifiedand principled notion of certain answers. Using it; we show that for queries satisfying somenatural conditions (like not losing information if a more informative input is given) …,IJCAI,2015,1

Experimenting Ontology-based Data Access with MASTRO,Domenico Fabio Savo; Domenico Lembo; Maurizio Lenzerini; Antonella Poggi; Mariano Rodriguez-Muro; Vittorio Romagnoli; Marco Ruzzi; Gabriele Stella,While the amount of data stored in current information systems continuously grows; turningthese data into information is still one of the most challenging tasks for IT. Specifically; theinformation systems of medium and large organizations are typically constituted by several;independent; and distributed data sources; and this poses great difficulties with respect tothe goal of accessing data in a unified and coherent way. Such a unified access is crucial forgetting useful information out of the system. This explains why organizations spend a greatdeal of time and money for the understanding; the governance; and the integration of datastored in different sources [5]. Below we report some reasons that make unified data accessproblematic:(i) despite the fact that the initial design of a collection of data sources (eg; adatabase) is adequate; corrective maintenance actions tend to re-shape the data sources …,SEBD,2010,1

When looking for an information; one possibility is to usea keyword-based search tool. However; this kind of tool has several well-known limitations.In this paper we propose a framework for Personal Information Management; calledOntoPIM; that relies on the use of a Personal Ontology; to assign a semantics to theinformation contained in the user desktop; as well as to query the system. In particular; bythe use of the Semantic Save; it provides the user the possibility to store any object ofinterest according to its semantics; ie to relate it to the concepts of the Personal Ontology;where an object may be a mail; a document; a picture; or any other type of data. Then; theuser is given the possibility to query the Personal Ontology; whereas the system carries …,IRCDL,2006,1
Filling the gap between data federation and data integration.,Antonella Poggi; Marco Ruzzi,Abstract. Today's fast and continuous growth of large business organizations enforces theneed to integrate and share data coming from a number of heterogeneous and distributeddata sources. To solve this kind of problem; data federation tools suggest the adoption of adatabase management system as a kind of middleware infrastructure that uses a set ofwrappers to access heterogeneous data sources. In this paper; we highlight federation toolslimitations with respect to the information integration problem and show how data integrationsystems overcome such limitations. We propose then two different techniques to implementa data integration system using a data federation tool. Finally; we present experimentalresults that compare the two solutions.,SEBD,2004,1

Semantic technology for open data publishing,Gianluca Cima; Maurizio Lenzerini; Antonella Poggi,Abstract After years of focus on technologies for big data storing and processing; manyobservers are pointing out that making sense of big data cannot be done without suitabletools for conceptualizing; preparing; and integrating data (see http://www. dbta. com/).Research in the last years has shown that taking into account the semantics of data is crucialfor devising powerful data integration solutions. In this work we focus on a specific paradigmfor semantic data integration; named" Ontology-Based Data Access"(OBDA); proposed in [1--4]. According to such paradigm; the client of the information system is freed from beingaware of how data and processes are structured in concrete resources (databases; softwareprograms; services; etc.); and interacts with the system by expressing her queries and goalsin terms of a conceptual representation of the domain of interest; called ontology.

Updating Data and Knowledge Bases.,Antonella Poggi,An Ontology-Based Data Access (OBDA) system is a three-layered information system that:consists of: an ontology (or conceptual schema; or knowledge base intensional level); whichis an abstract description of the domain of interest; a set of data sources containing theactual data; and a set of mappings; ie; assertions expressing the relationships between theontology and the actual data; provides access to actual data through query answering overthe ontology.; can be seen as a data integration system; whose “global schema” isindependent from the data sources and talks about objects of the domain; and aboutrelationships among these objects; where the latter are described in terms of an expressivelogic-based language,SEBD,2015,*
A higher-order semantics for OWL 2 QL ontologies,Maurizio Lenzerini; Lorenzo Lepore; Antonella Poggi,Recent OBDA projects have pointed out that one of the drawbacks of OWL 2 is the lack ofmetamodeling and metaquerying capabilities; ie; features for specifying and reasoningabout metaconcepts and metaproperties [1]. Roughly speaking; a metaconcept is a conceptwhose instances can be themselves concepts; and a metaproperty is a relationship betweenmetaconcepts. Although OWL 2 provides syntactic support for metamodeling throughpunning (by which the same name can be used to denote ontology elements of differentcategories; such as a class and an individual); we argue that the official semantics of OWL 2;the so-called Direct Semantics (DS); treats punning in a way that is not adequate forrepresenting metaconcepts and metaproperties. The reason is simply that propermetamodeling requires that the same element plays the role of individual and class (or …,28thInternational Workshop on Description Logics,2015,*

Mastro allows users foraccessing external data sources by querying an ontology expressed in a fragment of theW3C Web Ontology Language (OWL). As in data integration [5]; mappings are used inOBDA to specify the correspondence between a unified view of the domain (called globalschema in data integration terminology) and the data stored at the sources. Thedistinguishing feature of the OBDA approach; however; is the fact that the global schema isspecified using an ontology language; which typically allows to provide a richconceptualization of the domain of interest; independently from the source representation.,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2012,*

The On-TIME project was born as follow-up of a DELOS task within the UserInterface and Visualization workpackage. Its general aim is to provide the user with a systemthat allows her to focus on tasks rather than just on managing her personal information; as intraditional personal information management systems. To achieve this goal; user data andtasks are described in terms of explicit semantics that the user can share; ie; by means of aPersonal Ontology; reflecting the user's view of the world and her personal interests. In thispaper; we describe the main current achievements of the on-going On-TIME project; namelythe actual architecture and the effective user interface of a first working prototype.,IRCDL,2009,*

Hi (DL-LiteR) is a higher-order Description Logic obtained from DL-LiteR by addingmetamodeling features; and is equipped with a query language that is able to expresshigher-order queries. We investigate the problem of answering a particular class of suchqueries; called instance higher-order queries; posed over Hi (DL-LiteR) knowledge bases(KBs). The only existing algorithm for this problem is based on the idea of reducing theevaluation of a higherorder query q over a Hi (DL-LiteR) KB to the evaluation of a union offirst-order queries over a DL-LiteR KB; built from q by instantiating its metavariables in allpossible ways. Although of polynomial time complexity with respect to the size of the KB; thisalgorithm turns out to be inefficient in practice.

Dealing with inconsistencies and incompleteness in database update (position paper),Giuseppe De Giacomo; Maurizio Lenzerini; Antonella Poggi; Riccardo Rosati,Several areas of research and various application domains have been concerned in the lastyears with the problem of dealing with incomplete databases.
