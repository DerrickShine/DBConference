Sieve: linked data quality assessment and fusion,Pablo N Mendes; Hannes Mühleisen; Christian Bizer,Abstract The Web of Linked Data grows rapidly and already contains data originating fromhundreds of data sources. The quality of data from those sources is very diverse; as valuesmay be out of date; incomplete or incorrect. Moreover; data sources may provide conflictingvalues for a single real-world object. In order for Linked Data applications to consume datafrom this global data space in an integrated fashion; a number of challenges have to beovercome. One of these challenges is to rate and to integrate data based on their quality.However; quality is a very subjective matter; and finding a canonic judgement that is suitablefor each and every task is not feasible.,Proceedings of the 2012 Joint EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2012,192
Deployment of rdfa; microdata; and microformats on the web–a quantitative analysis,Christian Bizer; Kai Eckert; Robert Meusel; Hannes Mühleisen; Michael Schuhmacher; Johanna Völker,Abstract More and more websites embed structured data describing for instance products;reviews; blog posts; people; organizations; events; and cooking recipes into their HTMLpages using markup standards such as Microformats; Microdata and RDFa. Thisdevelopment has accelerated in the last two years as major Web companies; such asGoogle; Facebook; Yahoo!; and Microsoft; have started to use the embedded data withintheir applications. In this paper; we analyze the adoption of RDFa; Microdata; andMicroformats across the Web. Our study is based on a large public Web crawl dating fromearly 2012 and consisting of 3 billion HTML pages which originate from over 40 millionwebsites. The analysis reveals the deployment of the different markup standards; the maintopical areas of the published data as well as the different vocabularies that are used …,International Semantic Web Conference,2013,73
Web Data Commons-Extracting Structured Data from Two Large Web Corpora.,Hannes Mühleisen; Christian Bizer,ABSTRACT More and more websites embed structured data describing for instanceproducts; people; organizations; places; events; resumes; and cooking recipes into theirHTML pages using encoding standards such as Microformats; Microdatas and RDFa. TheWeb Data Commons project extracts all Microformat; Microdata and RDFa data from theCommon Crawl web corpus; the largest and most up-todata web corpus that is currentlyavailable to the public; and provides the extracted data for download in the form of RDF-quads. In this paper; we give an overview of the project and present statistics about thepopularity of the different encoding standards as well as the kinds of data that are publishedusing each format.,LDOW,2012,55
SWRL-based access policies for linked data,Hannes Muhleisen; Martin Kost; Johann-Christoph Freytag,Abstract. Social applications are one of the fastest growing areas in the Web. However;privacy issues ensue if all information of all users of these applications is stored on a singlecomputer system. With small extensions to Semantic Web technologies and Linked Dataconcepts; a distributed approach to the social web is possible; where users retain fine-grained control over their data and are still able to combine their data with users on differentsystems. We describe our concept of a Policy-enabled Linked Data Server (PeLDS) obeyinguser-defined access policies for the stored information. PeLDS also supportsconfigurationfree distributed authentication. Access policies are expressed in a newlydeveloped compact notation for the Semantic Web Rule Language. Authentication isperformed using SSL certificates and the FOAF+ SSL verification approach.

Large-scale storage and reasoning for semantic data using swarms,Hannes Muhleisen; Kathrin Dentler,Scalable; adaptive and robust approaches to store and analyze the massive amounts ofdata expected from Semantic Web applications are needed to bring the Web of Data to itsfull potential. The solution at hand is to distribute both data and requests onto multiplecomputers. Apart from storage; the annotation of data with machine-processable semanticsis essential for realizing the vision of the Semantic Web. Reasoning on webscale data facesthe same requirements as storage. Swarm-based approaches have been shown to producenear-optimal solutions for hard problems in a completely decentralized way. We propose anovel concept for reasoning within a fully distributed and self-organized storage system thatis based on the collective behavior of swarm individuals and does not require any schemareplication. We show the general feasibility and efficiency of our approach with a proof-of …,IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine,2012,16
Linked data for building a map of researchers,Olaf Hartig; Hannes Mühleisen; Johann-Christoph Freytag,Abstract Researchers Map 1 is a simple mash-up application that provides a map ofprofessors of the German database community; or more precisely; of the professors'workplaces (cf. Figure 1). The list of professors represented in the map can be filtered byresearch interests such as query optimization or data warehousing. Selecting a professoropens a list of her/his publications. We developed Researchers Map to showcase thepotential of Linked Data for mash-up applications. For this reason; Researchers Map issolely based on data that is published following the Linked Data principles [1]. Fig. 1.Screenshot of Researchers Map Researchers Map is a prototype for a new kind ofapplications which enable users to retain full control over their data.

A self-organized semantic storage service,Hannes Mühleisen; Anne Augustin; Tilman Walther; Marko Harasic; Kia Teymourian; Robert Tolksdorf,Abstract Traditional approaches for data storage and analysis are facing their limits whenhandling the enormous data amounts of today's applications. We believe that a radicaldeparture from contemporary architectures of stores is necessary to satisfy that centralscalability requirement. One of the most promising new schools of thought in system designare swarm intelligent and swarm-based approaches for data distribution and organization. Inthis paper; we describe our current work on a swarm-based storage service for SemanticWeb data. This storage service utilizes algorithms discovered in the behavior of ant colonies.We describe these algorithms and our enhancements to them as well as our evaluation ofthe implementation.,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Information Integration and Web-based Applications & Services,2010,15
Augmenting the Web of Data using Referers.,Hannes Mühleisen; Anja Jentzsch,ABSTRACT Linked Data relies on one central concept: Typed links connect entities storedwithin data sets published by different individuals. Manual input and mapping are commontechniques to create these links. We propose a novel method; where HTTP Refererinformation is used to create new links between Linked Data entities stored in different datasets. We evaluate our method using 27.86 million real-world log entries from web servershosting Linked Data.,LDOW,2011,12
Old dogs are great at new tricks: Column stores for IR prototyping,Hannes Mühleisen; Thaer Samar; Jimmy Lin; Arjen De Vries,Abstract We make the suggestion that instead of implementing custom index structures andquery evaluation algorithms; IR researchers should simply store document representationsin a column-oriented relational database and implement ranking models using SQL. Forrapid prototyping; this is particularly advantageous since researchers can explore newscoring functions and features by simply issuing SQL queries; without needing to writeimperative code. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by an implementation ofconjunctive BM25 using two modern column stores. Experiments on a web collection showthat a retrieval engine built in this manner achieves effectiveness and efficiency on par withcustom-built retrieval engines; but provides many additional advantages; including cleanerquery semantics; a simpler architecture; built-in support for error analysis; and the ability …,Proceedings of the 37th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research & development in information retrieval,2014,10
Multi-level indexing in a distributed self-organized storage system,Hannes Mühleisen; Tilman Walther; Robert Tolksdorf,In many systems providing storage and retrieval operations on data; indices are used tomake these operations more efficient. Distributed storage systems provide means todistribute the burden of storing and retrieving data onto multiple different computers. Routingindices can answer the central question in these systems: Where should one look for aspecified data item? To be able to query for different columns in a relation or different entriesin tuples; indexing for multiple dimensions is necessary. Our group applies a swarm-basedapproach to distributed storage leading to a new class of distributed systems; which are fullyself-organized in their behavior and lack any shared global data structures. In this paper; weresearch whether multiple levels of routing indices can be maintained and used in such adistributed and self-organized storage service. To achieve this; we look into different …,Evolutionary Computation (CEC); 2011 IEEE Congress on,2011,10
Peak performance: Remote memory revisited,Hannes Mühleisen; Romulo Gonçalves; Martin Kersten,Abstract Many database systems share a need for large amounts of fast storage. However;economies of scale limit the utility of extending a single machine with an arbitrary amount ofmemory. The recent broad availability of the zero-copy data transfer protocol RDMA over low-latency and high-throughput network connections such as InfiniBand prompts us to revisitthe long-proposed usage of memory provided by remote machines. In this paper; we presenta solution to make use of remote memory without manipulation of the operating system; andinvestigate the impact on database performance.,Proceedings of the Ninth International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2013,9
Automatic integration of metadata into the web of linked data,Olaf Hartig; Jun Zhao; Hannes Mühleisen,Abstract. In order to enable a reliable and approved consumption and processing of LinkedData in applications it requires various information about the consumed data (eg licensingand provenance). Since a large amount of this information is available to the publishers ofthe data it should become a practice to provide this information as metadata. Wedemonstrate components that provide an easy-to-use mechanism for adding metadata toRDF graphs served by Linked Data publishing tools.,Proceedings of the Demo Session at the 2nd Workshop on Trust and Privacy on the Social and Semantic Web (SPOT) at ESWC,2010,7
Best of both worlds: Relational databases and statistics,Hannes Mühleisen; Thomas Lumley,Abstract Statistics software packages and relational database systems possessconsiderable overlap in the area of data loading; handling; and transformation. However;only databases are mainly optimized towards high performance in this area. In this paper;we present our approach on bringing the best of these two worlds together. We integrate theanalytics-optimized database MonetDB and the R environment for statistical computing in anon-obtrusive; transparent and compatible way.,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2013,6
Data location optimization for a self-organized distributed storage system,Hannes Mühleisen; Tilman Walther; Robert Tolksdorf,Swarm-inspired algorithms allow the creation of complex systems that are scalable in manydimensions; adaptable to changing conditions; and robust against failure. These propertiesmake them suitable for the challenges inherent in distributed storage systems. However;these swarm-based approaches reach their impressive performance by trading awaycorrectness guarantees; occasionally leading to misplaced data items. In order to achieveconsistent storage; there is a need for a constant optimization of the store's data structure. Inthis paper; we describe a fully distributed and scalable heuristic for the optimization of thelocation of stored data items within a distributed storage system based on the brood sortingmethod used by ants. We evaluate our heuristic using best-and worst-case test data sets todetermine whether our location optimization method converges and whether it improves …,Nature and Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC); 2011 Third World Congress on,2011,6
Vectorized udfs in column-stores,Mark Raasveldt; Hannes Mühleisen,Abstract Data Scientists rely on vector-based scripting languages such as R; Python andMATLAB to perform ad-hoc data analysis on potentially large data sets. When facing largedata sets; they are only efficient when data is processed using vectorized or bulk operations.At the same time; overwhelming volume and variety of data as well as parsing overheadsuggests that the use of specialized analytical data management systems would bebeneficial. Data might also already be stored in a database. Efficient execution of dataanalysis programs such as data mining directly inside a database greatly improves analysisefficiency. We investigate how these vector-based languages can be efficiently integrated inthe processing model of operator--at--a--time databases. We present MonetDB/Python; anew system that combines the open-source database MonetDB with the vector-based …,Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2016,5
A survey on self-organized semantic storage,Hannes Mühleisen; Tilman Walther; Robert Tolksdorf,Purpose–The purpose of this paper is to show the potential of self-organized semanticstorage services. The semantic web has provided a vision of how to build the applications ofthe future. A software component dedicated to the storage and retrieval of semanticinformation is an important but generic part of these applications. Apart from merefunctionality; these storage components also have to provide good performance regardingthe non-functional requirements scalability; adaptability and robustness. Distributing the taskof storing and querying semantic information onto multiple computers is a way of achievingthis performance. However; the distribution of a task onto a set of computers connectedusing a communication network is not trivial. One solution is self-organized technologies;where no central entity coordinates the system's operation. Design/methodology …,International Journal of Web Information Systems,2011,5
A round table for multi-disciplinary research on Geospatial and Climate Data,Romulo Goncalves; Milena Ivanova; Foteini Alvanaki; Jason Maassen; Kostis Kyzirakos; Oscar Martinez-Rubi; Hannes Mühleisen,Earth observation sciences produce large sets of data which are inherently rich in spatialand geo-spatial information. Together with live data collected from monitoring systems andlarge collections of semantically rich objects they provide new opportunities for advancedeScience research on climatology; urban planing and smart cities. Such combination ofheterogeneous data sets forms a new source of knowledge. Efficient knowledge extractionfrom them is an eScience challenge. It requires efficient bulk data injection from both staticand streaming data sources; dynamic adaptation of the physical and logical schema;efficient methods to correlate spatial and temporal data; and flexibility to (re-) formulate theresearch question at any time.

Weaving the Web (VTT) of Data.,Thomas Steiner; Hannes Mühleisen; Ruben Verborgh; Pierre-Antoine Champin; Benoît Encelle; Yannick Prié,ABSTRACT Video has become a first class citizen on the Web with broad support in allcommon Web browsers. Where with structured mark-up on webpages we have made thevision of the Web of Data a reality; in this paper; we propose a new vision that we name theWeb (VTT) of Data; alongside with concrete steps to realize this vision. It is based on theevolving standards WebVTT for adding timed text tracks to videos and JSON-LD; a JSON-based format to serialize Linked Data. Just like the Web of Data that is based on therelationships among structured data; the Web (VTT) of Data is based on relationshipsamong videos based on WebVTT files; which we use as Web-native spatiotemporal LinkedData containers with JSON-LD payloads. In a first step; we provide necessary backgroundinformation on the technologies we use. In a second step; we perform a largescale …,LDOW,2014,4
Don't hold my data hostage: a case for client protocol redesign,Mark Raasveldt; Hannes Mühleisen,Abstract Transferring a large amount of data from a database to a client program is asurprisingly expensive operation. The time this requires can easily dominate the queryexecution time for large result sets. This represents a significant hurdle for external dataanalysis; for example when using statistical software. In this paper; we explore and analysethe result set serialization design space. We present experimental results from a large chunkof the database market and show the inefficiencies of current approaches. We then proposea columnar serialization method that improves transmission performance by an order ofmagnitude.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,3
Efficient data management and statistics with zero-copy integration,Jonathan Lajus; Hannes Mühleisen,Abstract Statistical analysts have long been struggling with evergrowing data volumes.While specialized data management systems such as relational databases would be able tohandle the data; statistical analysis tools are far more convenient to express complex dataanalyses. An integration of these two classes of systems has the potential to overcome thedata management issue while at the same time keeping analysis convenient. However; onemust keep a careful eye on implementation overheads such as serialization. In this paper;we propose the in-process integration of data management and analytical tools.Furthermore; we argue that a zero-copy integration is feasible due to the omnipresence of C-style arrays containing native types. We discuss the general concept and present aprototype of this integration based on the columnar relational database MonetDB and the …,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2014,3
Column Store for GWAC: A High-cadence; High-density; Large-scale Astronomical Light Curve Pipeline and Distributed Shared-nothing Database,Meng Wan; Chao Wu; Jing Wang; Yulei Qiu; Liping Xin; Sjoerd Mullender; Hannes Mühleisen; Bart Scheers; Ying Zhang; Niels Nes; Martin Kersten; Yongpan Huang; Jinsong Deng; Jianyan Wei,Abstract The ground-based wide-angle camera array (GWAC); a part of the SVOM spacemission; will search for various types of optical transients by continuously imaging a field ofview (FOV) of 5000 degrees 2 every 15 s. Each exposure consists of 36× 4k× 4k pixels;typically resulting in 36×~ 175;600 extracted sources. For a modern time-domain astronomyproject like GWAC; which produces massive amounts of data with a high cadence; it ischallenging to search for short timescale transients in both real-time and archived data; andto build long-term light curves for variable sources. Here; we develop a high-cadence; high-density light curve pipeline (HCHDLP) to process the GWAC data in real-time; and design adistributed shared-nothing database to manage the massive amount of archived data whichwill be used to generate a source catalog with more than 100 billion records during 10 …,Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific,2016,2

Query processing in a self-organized storage system,Hannes Mühleisen,ABSTRACT The amount of scalability and robustness provided by current solutions for thestorage and retrieval of data might not be sufficient to support ever-larger web applications.By using swarm intelligence to route operations in a distributed storage system; theselimitations can be overcome. However; the possibilities for the efficient evaluation ofcomplex queries in this kind of system are scarce and have not been researched yet. Basedon a schema-less data model along with the building blocks for complex queries on thismodel; I present an approach for complex query processing as part of my PhD work. Here;complex queries are moved through the distributed storage system; while constantly beingre-optimized using strictly local information. The approach is described along with anevaluation methodology and a test protocol. My goal is to contribute complex query …,Proc. VLDB2011 PhD Workshop; co-located with 37th Int. Conf.

Configuring a self-organized semantic storage service,Hannes Muhleisen; Tilman Walther; Anne Augustin; Marko Harasic; Robert Tolksdorf,Abstract. Scalability requirements for semantic stores lead to distributedhardwareindependent solutions to handle and analyze massive amounts of semantic data.We use a different approach by imitating the behaviour of swarm individuals to achieve thisscalability.

Uniqueness; Density; and Keyness: Exploring Class Hierarchies.,Anja Jentzsch; Hannes Mühleisen; Felix Naumann,Abstract. The Web of Data contains a large number of openly-available datasets covering awide variety of topics. In order to benefit from this massive amount of open data; eg; to addvalue to an organization's internal data; such external datasets must be analyzed andunderstood already at the basic level of data types; uniqueness; constraints; value patterns;etc. For Linked Datasets and other Web data such meta information is currently quite limitedor not available at all. Data profiling techniques are needed to compute respective statisticsand meta information. Analyzing datasets along the vocabulary-defined taxonomichierarchies yields further insights; such as the data distribution at different hierarchy levels;or possible mappings betweens vocabularies or datasets. In particular; key candidates forentities are difficult to find in light of the sparsity of property values on the Web of Data. To …,COLD,2015,1
Web-scale range queries in a self-organized storage service,Hannes Muhleisen; Tilman Walther; Robert Tolksdorf,Abstract Distributed solutions for the storage and retrieval of large amounts of data arenecessary to handle the growing amounts of knowledge expected from future applications.The support for range queries provides much-needed expressivity; for example for querieson data annotated with location and time. We present a novel and scalable way for rangequery evaluation in our distributed storage system based on behaviour found in ants.Routing decisions in this system are taken on the basis of virtual pheromone paths leadingfrom one node to another node; distinct for different data items. Range queries for singleranges can be evaluated by checking the pheromone paths for the entire range and forkingthe operation to several nodes if necessary. An aggregation method ensures the efficiencyof the routing operations.

Multi-Hypothesis CSV Parsing,Till Döhmen; Hannes Mühleisen; Peter Boncz,Abstract Comma Separated Value (CSV) files are commonly used to represent data. CSV isa very simple format; yet we show that it gives rise to a surprisingly large amount ofambiguities in its parsing and interpretation. We summarize the state-of-the-art in CSVparsers; which typically make a linear series of parsing and interpretation decisions; suchthat any wrong decision at an earlier stage can negatively affect all downstream decisions.Since computation time is much less scarce than human time; we propose to turn CSVparsing into a ranking problem. Our quality-oriented multi-hypothesis CSV parsing approachgenerates several concurrent hypotheses about dialect; table structure; etc. and ranks thesehypotheses based on quality features of the resulting table. This approach makes it possibleto create an advanced CSV parser that makes many different decisions; yet keeps the …,Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2017,*
Scaling column imprints using advanced vectorization,Lefteris Sidirourgos; Hannes Mühleisen,Abstract Column Imprints is a pre-filtering secondary index for answering range queries. Themain feature of imprints is that they are light-weight and are based on compressed bit-vectors; one per cacheline; that quickly determine if the values in that cacheline satisfy thepredicates of a query. The main overhead of the imprints implementation is the manysequential value comparisons against the boundaries of a virtual equi-height histogram.Similarly; during query scans; many sequential value comparisons are performed to identifyfalse positives. In this paper; we speed-up the process of imprints creation and querying byusing advanced vectorization techniques. We also experimentally explore the benefits ofstretching imprints to larger bit-vector sizes and blocks of data; using 256-bit SIMD registers.Our findings are very promising for both imprints and for future index design research that …,Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware,2017,*
Database-Inspired Optimizations for Statistical Analysis,Hannes Mühleisen; Alexander Bertram; Maarten-Jan Kallen,Abstract Computing complex statistics on large amounts of data is no longer a corner case;but a daily challenge. However; current tools such as GNU R were not built to efficientlyhandle large data sets. We propose to vastly improve the execution of R scripts byinterpreting them as a declaration of intent rather than a imperative order set in stone. Thisallows us to apply optimization techniques from the columnar data management researchfield. We have implemented several of these optimizers in Renjin; a JVM-based Open-Source execution environment for R scripts. The demonstration of our approach using aseries of micro-benchmarks and experiments on complex survey analysis show orders-of-magnitude improvements in analysis cost.,Journal of Statistical Software,2017,*

Column Stores as an IR Prototyping Tool,Hannes Mühleisen; Thaer Samar; Jimmy Lin; Arjen P De Vries,Abstract We make the suggestion that instead of implementing custom index structures andquery evaluation algorithms; IR researchers should simply store document representationsin a column-oriented relational database and write ranking models using SQL. For rapidprototyping; this is particularly advantageous since researchers can explore new rankingfunctions and features by simply issuing SQL queries; without needing to write imperativecode. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by an implementation of conjunctiveBM25 using MonetDB on a part of the ClueWeb12 collection.,European Conference on Information Retrieval,2014,*

Architecture-independent distributed query processing,Hannes Mühleisen,Zusammenfassung Distributed storage systems are forced to select a trade-off between theincompatible goals Scalability; Consistency and Availability. No matter which coordinationmechanism is used to create consistency; its choice greatly influences the systemsperformance regarding this trade-off. Furthermore; support for complex queries is highlydesirable to support complex analyses without performance nightmares. However; previousproposals for distributed complex query processing are bound to a particular coordinationmechanism; and are therefore difficult to adapt to new architectures. In this thesis; the goalwas to investigate distributed complex query processing independent of a particularcoordination mechanism and network architecture. To this end; we have developedcomprehensive abstractions of the components of distributed storage systems. Also; we …,*,2013,*
Development of Best Practices for Large-scale Data Management Infrastructure,S Stadtmüller; HF Mühleisen; C Bizer; ML Kersten; JA deRijke; FE Groffen; Y Zhang; G Ladwig; A Harth; M Trampus,htmlabstractThe amount of available data for processing is constantly increasing andbecomes more diverse. We collect our experiences on deploying large-scale datamanagement tools on local-area clusters or cloud infrastructures and provide guidance touse these computing and storage infrastructures. In particular we describe Apache Hadoop;one of the most widely used software libraries to perform large-scale data analysis tasks onclusters of computers in parallel and provide guidance on how to achieve optimal executiontime when performing analysis over large-scale data. Furthermore we report on ourexperiences with projects; that provide valuable insights in the deployment and use of large-scale data management tools: The Web Data Commons project for which we extracted allMicroformat; Microdata and RDFa data from the Common Crawl web corpus; the largest …,PlanetData Deliverables,2012,*
Web Data Commons–Extracting Structured Data from Two Large Web Corpora,Christian Bizer; Hannes Mühleisen,Zusammenfassung More and more websites embed structured data describing for instanceproducts; people; organizations; places; events; resumes; and cooking recipes into theirHTML pages using encoding standards such as Microformats; Microdatas and RDFa. TheWeb Data Commons project extracts all Microformat; Microdata and RDFa data from theCommon Crawl web corpus; the largest and most up-todata web corpus that is currentlyavailable to the public; and provides the extracted data for download in the form of RDF-quads. In this paper; we give an overview of the project and present statistics about thepopularity of the different encoding standards as well as the kinds of data that are publishedusing each format.,*,2012,*

User-Defined Rules in a Distributed Address Book,Hannes Mühleisen; Adrian Paschke,Abstract. The Semantic Web as an evolution of the World Wide Web allows its users to sharecontent over the boundaries of applications and web sites. However; current web-basedsystems for the controlled distribution of private information require the presence ofinformation on centralized systems. A potential risk for the user is the central system operatorwhich has full access to all stored information. Moreover; if a malicious user getsunauthorized access to the operator's management rights; the information stored by all usersis exposed. In this paper; we demonstrate our alternative approach of a distributed addressbook; where users can store their information on a system under their own control. A specialfocus in our implementation was on the usability; in particular for the complex rulegeneration and processing chain; so that any user familiar with social network software is …,*,2010,*
