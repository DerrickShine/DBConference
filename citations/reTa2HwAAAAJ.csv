Roles of continuous neurogenesis in the structural and functional integrity of the adult forebrain,Itaru Imayoshi; Masayuki Sakamoto; Toshiyuki Ohtsuka; Keizo Takao; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Masahiro Yamaguchi; Kensaku Mori; Toshio Ikeda; Shigeyoshi Itohara; Ryoichiro Kageyama,Abstract Neurogenesis occurs continuously in the forebrain of adult mammals; but thefunctional importance of adult neurogenesis is still unclear. Here; using a genetic labelingmethod in adult mice; we found that continuous neurogenesis results in the replacement ofthe majority of granule neurons in the olfactory bulb and a substantial addition of granuleneurons to the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Genetic ablation of newly formed neurons inadult mice led to a gradual decrease in the number of granule cells in the olfactory bulb;inhibition of increases in the granule cell number in the dentate gyrus and impairment ofbehaviors in contextual and spatial memory; which are known to depend on hippocampus.These results suggest that continuous neurogenesis is required for the maintenance andreorganization of the whole interneuron system in the olfactory bulb; the modulation and …,Nature neuroscience,2008,833
NFAT dysregulation by increased dosage of DSCR1 and DYRK1A on chromosome 21,Joseph R Arron; Monte M Winslow; Alberto Polleri; Ching-Pin Chang; Hai Wu; Xin Gao; Joel R Neilson; Lei Chen; Jeremy J Heit; Seung K Kim; Nobuyuki Yamasaki; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Uta Francke; Isabella A Graef; Gerald R Crabtree,Abstract Trisomy 21 results in Down's syndrome; but little is known about how a 1.5-foldincrease in gene dosage produces the pleiotropic phenotypes of Down's syndrome. Herewe report that two genes; DSCR1 and DYRK1A; lie within the critical region of humanchromosome 21 and act synergistically to prevent nuclear occupancy of NFATc transcriptionfactors; which are regulators of vertebrate development. We use mathematical modelling topredict that autoregulation within the pathway accentuates the effects of trisomy of DSCR1and DYRK1A; leading to failure to activate NFATc target genes under specific conditions.Our observations of calcineurin-and Nfatc-deficient mice; Dscr1-and Dyrk1a–overexpressingmice; mouse models of Down's syndrome and human trisomy 21 are consistent with thesepredictions. We suggest that the 1.5-fold increase in dosage of DSCR1 and DYRK1A …,Nature,2006,571
Forebrain-specific calcineurin knockout selectively impairs bidirectional synaptic plasticity and working/episodic-like memory,Hongkui Zeng; Sumantra Chattarji; Michaela Barbarosie; Laure Rondi-Reig; Benjamin D Philpot; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Mark F Bear; Susumu Tonegawa,Abstract Calcineurin is a calcium-dependent protein phosphatase that has been implicatedin various aspects of synaptic plasticity. By using conditional gene-targeting techniques; wecreated mice in which calcineurin activity is disrupted specifically in the adult forebrain. Athippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses; LTD was significantly diminished; and therewas a significant shift in the LTD/LTP modification threshold in mutant mice. Strikingly;although performance was normal in hippocampus-dependent reference memory tasks;including contextual fear conditioning and the Morris water maze; the mutant mice wereimpaired in hippocampus-dependent working and episodic-like memory tasks; including thedelayed matching-to-place task and the radial maze task.

Conditional calcineurin knockout mice exhibit multiple abnormal behaviors related to schizophrenia,Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Lorene M Leiter; David J Gerber; Raul R Gainetdinov; Tatyana D Sotnikova; Hongkui Zeng; Marc G Caron; Susumu Tonegawa,Abstract Calcineurin (CN); a calcium-and calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase; playsa significant role in the central nervous system. Previously; we reported that forebrain-specific CN knockout mice (CN mutant mice) have impaired working memory. To furtheranalyze the behavioral effects of CN deficiency; we subjected CN mutant mice to acomprehensive behavioral test battery. Mutant mice showed increased locomotor activity;decreased social interaction; and impairments in prepulse inhibition and latent inhibition. Inaddition; CN mutant mice displayed an increased response to the locomotor stimulatingeffects of MK-801. Collectively; the abnormalities of CN mutant mice are strikingly similar tothose described for schizophrenia. We propose that alterations affecting CN signaling couldcomprise a contributing factor in schizophrenia pathogenesis.,PNAS,2003,421
Mice lacking the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor are hypophagic and lean,Masahisa Yamada; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Alokesh Duttaroy; Akihiro Yamanaka; Toru Moriguchi; Ryosuke Makita; Masaharu Ogawa; Chieh J Chou; Bing Xia; Jacqueline N Crawley; Christian C Felder; Chu-Xia Deng; Jürgen Wess,Abstract Members of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor family (M1–M5) have centralroles in the regulation of many fundamental physiological functions 1; 2. Identifying thespecific receptor subtype (s) that mediate the diverse muscarinic actions of acetylcholine isof considerable therapeutic interest; but has proved difficult primarily because of a lack ofsubtype-selective ligands 3. Here we show that mice deficient in the M3 muscarinic receptor(M3R-/-mice) display a significant decrease in food intake; reduced body weight andperipheral fat deposits; and very low levels of serum leptin and insulin. Paradoxically;hypothalamic messenger RNA levels of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH); which arenormally upregulated in fasted animals leading to an increase in food intake 4; 5; aresignificantly reduced in M3R-/-mice.

Hyperactivity and intact hippocampus-dependent learning in mice lacking the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor,Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Masahisa Yamada; Alokesh Duttaroy; Jürgen Wess,Members of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor family are thought to play key roles in theregulation of a large number of important functions of the CNS. However; the precise roles ofthe individual muscarinic receptor subtypes in modulating these processes are not wellunderstood at present; primarily because of the lack of ligands with sufficient receptorsubtype selectivity. To investigate the behavioral significance of the M 1 muscarinic receptor(M 1 R); which is abundantly expressed in the forebrain; we subjected M 1 receptor-deficientmice (M 1 R−/− mice) to a battery of behavioral tests. M 1 R−/− mice showed no significantimpairments in neurological reflexes; motor coordination; pain sensitivity; and prepulseinhibition. Strikingly; however; M 1 R−/− mice consistently exhibited a pronounced increasein locomotor activity in various tests; including open field; elevated plus maze; and light …,Journal of Neuroscience,2001,336
Abnormal behavior in a chromosome-engineered mouse model for human 15q11-13 duplication seen in autism,Jin Nakatani; Kota Tamada; Fumiyuki Hatanaka; Satoko Ise; Hisashi Ohta; Kiyoshi Inoue; Shozo Tomonaga; Yasuhito Watanabe; Yeun Jun Chung; Ruby Banerjee; Kazuya Iwamoto; Tadafumi Kato; Makoto Okazawa; Kenta Yamauchi; Koichi Tanda; Keizo Takao; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Allan Bradley; Toru Takumi,Substantial evidence suggests that chromosomal abnormalities contribute to the risk ofautism. The duplication of human chromosome 15q11-13 is known to be the most frequentcytogenetic abnormality in autism. We have modeled this genetic change in mice by usingchromosome engineering to generate a 6.3 Mb duplication of the conserved linkage groupon mouse chromosome 7. Mice with a paternal duplication display poor social interaction;behavioral inflexibility; abnormal ultrasonic vocalizations; and correlates of anxiety. Anincreased MBII52 snoRNA within the duplicated region; affecting the serotonin 2c receptor(5-HT2cR); correlates with altered intracellular Ca2+ responses elicited by a 5-HT2cRagonist in neurons of mice with a paternal duplication. This chromosome-engineered mousemodel for autism seems to replicate various aspects of human autistic phenotypes and …,Cell,2009,313
Fyn-kinase as a determinant of ethanol sensitivity: relation to NMDA-receptor function,Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Takeshi Yagi; Hiromasa Kitazawa; Masahiro Yasuda; Nobufumi Kawai; Kenta Tsuboi; Hiroaki Niki,Animals vary in their sensitivity to ethanol; a trait at least partly determined by genetic factors.In order to identify possible responsible genes; mice lacking Fyn; a non–receptor typetyrosine kinase; were investigated. These mice were hypersensitive to the hypnotic effect ofethanol. The administration of ethanol enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) in the hippocampus of control mice but not in Fyn-deficientmice. An acute tolerance to ethanol inhibition of NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynapticpotentials in hippocampal slices developed in control mice but not in Fyn-deficient mice.These results indicate that Fyn affects behavioral; biochemical; and physiological responsesto ethanol.,Science,1997,304
Hippocampal neurogenesis regulates forgetting during adulthood and infancy,Katherine G Akers; Alonso Martinez-Canabal; Leonardo Restivo; Adelaide P Yiu; Antonietta De Cristofaro; Hwa-Lin Liz Hsiang; Anne L Wheeler; Axel Guskjolen; Yosuke Niibori; Hirotaka Shoji; Koji Ohira; Blake A Richards; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Sheena A Josselyn; Paul W Frankland,Throughout life; new neurons are continuously added to the dentate gyrus. As thiscontinuous addition remodels hippocampal circuits; computational models predict thatneurogenesis leads to degradation or forgetting of established memories. Consistent withthis; increasing neurogenesis after the formation of a memory was sufficient to induceforgetting in adult mice. By contrast; during infancy; when hippocampal neurogenesis levelsare high and freshly generated memories tend to be rapidly forgotten (infantile amnesia);decreasing neurogenesis after memory formation mitigated forgetting. In precocial species;including guinea pigs and degus; most granule cells are generated prenatally. Consistentwith reduced levels of postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis; infant guinea pigs and degusdid not exhibit forgetting. However; increasing neurogenesis after memory formation …,Science,2014,282
Evidence for association of schizophrenia with genetic variation in the 8p21. 3 gene; PPP3CC; encoding the calcineurin gamma subunit,David J Gerber; Diana Hall; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Sandra Demars; Joseph A Gogos; Maria Karayiorgou; Susumu Tonegawa,Abstract Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by a complex mode ofinheritance. Forebrain-specific CNB knockout mice display a spectrum of behavioralabnormalities related to altered behaviors observed in schizophrenia patients. To examinewhether calcineurin dysfunction is involved in schizophrenia etiology; we undertook studiesof an initial subset of calcineurin-related genes; prioritizing ones that map to loci previouslyimplicated in schizophrenia by linkage studies. Transmission disequilibrium studies in alarge sample of affected families detected association of the PPP3CC gene; which encodesthe calcineurin γ catalytic subunit; with disease. Our results identify PPP3CC; located at8p21. 3; as a potential schizophrenia susceptibility gene and support the proposal thatalterations in calcineurin signaling contribute to schizophrenia pathogenesis.,PNAS,2003,276
Genomic responses in mouse models greatly mimic human inflammatory diseases,Keizo Takao; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,Abstract The use of mice as animal models has long been considered essential in modernbiomedical research; but the role of mouse models in research was challenged by a recentreport that genomic responses in mouse models poorly mimic human inflammatorydiseases. Here we reevaluated the same gene expression datasets used in the previousstudy by focusing on genes whose expression levels were significantly changed in bothhumans and mice. Contrary to the previous findings; the gene expression levels in themouse models showed extraordinarily significant correlations with those of the humanconditions (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient: 0.43–0.68; genes changed in the samedirection: 77–93%; P= 6.5× 10− 11 to 1.2× 10− 35). Moreover; meta-analysis of thosedatasets revealed a number of pathways/biogroups commonly regulated by multiple …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2015,250
Smaller dendritic spines; weaker synaptic transmission; but enhanced spatial learning in mice lacking Shank1,Albert Y Hung; Kensuke Futai; Carlo Sala; Juli G Valtschanoff; Jubin Ryu; Mollie A Woodworth; Fleur L Kidd; Clifford C Sung; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Mark F Bear; Richard J Weinberg; Morgan Sheng,Experience-dependent changes in the structure of dendritic spines may contribute tolearning and memory. Encoded by three genes; the Shank family of postsynaptic scaffoldproteins are abundant and enriched in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of central excitatorysynapses. When expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons; Shank promotes thematuration and enlargement of dendritic spines. Recently; Shank3 has been geneticallyimplicated in human autism; suggesting an important role for Shank proteins in normalcognitive development. Here; we report the phenotype of Shank1 knock-out mice. Shank1mutants showed altered PSD protein composition; reduced size of dendritic spines; smaller;thinner PSDs; and weaker basal synaptic transmission. Standard measures of synapticplasticity were normal. Behaviorally; they had increased anxiety-related behavior and …,Journal of Neuroscience,2008,250
Schizophrenia-relevant behavioral testing in rodent models: a uniquely human disorder?,Craig M Powell; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,Animal models are extremely useful tools in defining pathogenesis and treatment of humandisease. Creating adequate animal models of complex neuropsychiatric disorders such asschizophrenia represents a particularly difficult challenge. In the case of schizophrenia; littleis certain regarding the etiology or pathophysiology of the human disease. In addition; manysymptoms of the disorder are difficult to measure directly in rodents. These challenges havenot daunted neuroscientists who are capitalizing on even subtle overlaps between thisuniquely human disorder and rodent behavior. In this perspective; we detail the features ofideal animal models of schizophrenia; the potential utility of such models; and the rodentbehaviors used to model certain aspects of schizophrenia. The development of such modelswill provide critical tools to understand the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and novel …,Biological psychiatry,2006,248

Althoughthey are abundant on neuronal cell membranes; their precise functions and importance inthe central nervous system (CNS) remain largely undefined. We have disrupted the geneencoding GD3 synthase (GD3S); a sialyltransferase expressed in the CNS that isresponsible for the synthesis of b-series gangliosides. GD3S−/− mice; even with an absenceof b-series gangliosides; appear to undergo normal development and have a normal lifespan. To further restrict the expression of gangliosides; the GD3S mutant mice werecrossbred with mice carrying a disrupted GalNAcT gene encoding β1; 4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase. These double mutant mice expressed GM3 as their majorganglioside. In contrast to the single mutant mice; the double mutants displayed a sudden …,Journal of Biological Chemistry,2001,201
M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor knock-out mice show deficits in behavioral flexibility; working memory; and hippocampal plasticity,Thomas Seeger; Irina Fedorova; Fang Zheng; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Elena Koustova; Jesus Gomeza; Anthony S Basile; Christian Alzheimer; Jürgen Wess,Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are known to play key roles in facilitating cognitiveprocesses. However; the specific roles of the individual muscarinic receptor subtypes (M 1-M5) in learning and memory are not well understood at present. In the present study; we usedwild-type (M2+/+) and M 2 receptor-deficient (M2-/-) mice to examine the potential role of M 2receptors in learning and memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. M2-/-mice showedsignificant deficits in behavioral flexibility and working memory in the Barnes circular mazeand the T-maze delayed alternation tests; respectively. The behavioral deficits of M2-/-micewere associated with profound changes in neuronal plasticity studied at the Schaffer-CA1synapse of hippocampal slices. Strikingly; short-term potentiation (STP) was abolished; andlong-term potentiation (LTP) was drastically reduced after high-frequency stimulation of …,Journal of Neuroscience,2004,198
Ischemia-induced neurogenesis of neocortical layer 1 progenitor cells,Koji Ohira; Takahiro Furuta; Hiroyuki Hioki; Kouichi C Nakamura; Eriko Kuramoto; Yasuyo Tanaka; Nobuo Funatsu; Keiko Shimizu; Takao Oishi; Motoharu Hayashi; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Takeshi Kaneko; Shun Nakamura,Abstract Adult mammalian neurogenesis occurs in the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb;whereas neocortical adult neurogenesis remains controversial. Several occurrences ofneocortical adult neurogenesis in injured neocortex were recently reported; suggesting thatneural stem cells (NSCs) or neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) that can be activated by injuryare maintained in the adult brain. However; it is not clear whether or where neocorticalNSCs/NPCs exist in the brain. We found NPCs in the neocortical layer 1 of adult rats andobserved that their proliferation was highly activated by global forebrain ischemia. Usingretrovirus-mediated labeling of layer 1 proliferating cells with membrane-targeted greenfluorescent protein; we found that the newly generated neurons were GABAergic and thatthe neurons were functionally integrated into the neuronal circuitry.

Neurogranin null mutant mice display performance deficits on spatial learning tasks with anxiety related components,Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Edom Yared; Jhang Ho Pak; Freesia L Huang; Kuo‐Ping Huang; Jacqueline N Crawley,Abstract Neurogranin/RC3 is a protein that binds calmodulin and serves as a substrate forprotein kinase C. Neuronally distributed in the hippocampus and forebrain; neurogranin ishighly expressed in dendritic spines of hippocampal pyramidal cells; implicating this proteinin long-term potentiation and in learning and memory processes. Null mutation of theneurogranin gene Ng generated viable knockout mice for analysis of the behavioralphenotype resulting from the absence of neurogranin protein. Ng−/− mice were normal onmeasures of general health; neurological reflexes; sensory abilities; and motor functions; ascompared to wild type littermate controls. On the Morris water task; Ng−/− mice failed toreach acquisition criterion on the hidden platform test and did not show selective search onthe probe trial.

Elevated plus maze for mice,Munekazu Komada; Keizo Takao; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,Abstract Although the mouse genome is now completely sequenced; the functions of most ofthe genes expressed in the brain are not known. The influence of a given gene on a specificbehavior can be determined by behavioral analysis of mutant mice. If a target gene isexpressed in the brain; behavioral phenotype of the mutant mice could elucidate the geneticmechanism of normal behaviors. The elevated plus maze test is one of the most widely usedtests for measuring anxiety-like behavior. The test is based on the natural aversion of micefor open and elevated areas; as well as on their natural spontaneous exploratory behavior innovel environments. The apparatus consists of open arms and closed arms; crossed in themiddle perpendicularly to each other; and a center area. Mice are given access to all of thearms and are allowed to move freely between them. The number of entries into the open …,Journal of visualized experiments: JoVE,2008,150
Loss of cadherin-11 adhesion receptor enhances plastic changes in hippocampal synapses and modifies behavioral responses,Toshiya Manabe; Hideru Togashi; Naoshige Uchida; Sachihiro C Suzuki; Yoshizumi Hayakawa; Masaru Yamamoto; Hiroki Yoda; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Masatoshi Takeichi; Osamu Chisaka,Cadherins organize symmetrical junctions between the pre-and postsynaptic membranes incentral synapses. One of them; cadherin-11 (cad11); is expressed in the limbic system of thebrain; most strongly in the hippocampus. Immunohistochemical studies of the hippocampusshowed that cad11 proteins were densely distributed in its synaptic neuropil zones; incultured hippocampal neurons; their distribution often overlapped with that of synaptophysin;and also occasionally with that of GluR1 at spines. To assess the role of cad11 in synapticformation and/or function; we analyzed brains of cad11-deficient mice. In these mice; long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus was; unexpectedly; enhanced;and the level of LTP saturation was increased. In behavioral tests; the mutant mice showedreduced fear-or anxiety-related responses. These results suggest that the cad11 …,Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience,2000,147
Tight junctions in Schwann cells of peripheral myelinated axons: a lesson from claudin-19–deficient mice,Tatsuo Miyamoto; Kazumasa Morita; Daisuke Takemoto; Kosei Takeuchi; Yuka Kitano; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Kiyomi Nakayama; Yasushi Okamura; Hiroyuki Sasaki; Yoshiki Miyachi; Mikio Furuse; Shoichiro Tsukita,Tight junction (TJ)–like structures have been reported in Schwann cells; but their molecularcomposition and physiological function remain elusive. We found that claudin-19; a novelmember of the claudin family (TJ adhesion molecules in epithelia); constituted thesestructures. Claudin-19–deficient mice were generated; and they exhibited behavioralabnormalities that could be attributed to peripheral nervous system deficits.Electrophysiological analyses showed that the claudin-19 deficiency affected the nerveconduction of peripheral myelinated fibers. Interestingly; the overall morphology of Schwanncells lacking claudin-19 expression appeared to be normal not only in the internodal regionbut also at the node of Ranvier; except that TJs completely disappeared; at least from theouter/inner mesaxons. These findings have indicated that; similar to epithelial cells …,J Cell Biol,2005,143
Sept4; a component of presynaptic scaffold and Lewy bodies; is required for the suppression of α-synuclein neurotoxicity,Masafumi Ihara; Nobuyuki Yamasaki; Akari Hagiwara; Ai Tanigaki; Ayumi Kitano; Rie Hikawa; Hidekazu Tomimoto; Makoto Noda; Masashi Takanashi; Hideo Mori; Nobutaka Hattori; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Makoto Kinoshita,In Parkinson disease (PD); α-synuclein aggregates called Lewy bodies often involve andsequester Septin4 (Sept4); a polymerizing scaffold protein. However; the pathophysiologicalsignificance of this phenomenon is unclear. Here; we show the physiological association ofSept4 with α-synuclein; the dopamine transporter; and other presynaptic proteins indopaminergic neurons; mice lacking Sept4 exhibit diminished dopaminergicneurotransmission due to scarcity of these presynaptic proteins. These data demonstrate animportant role for septin scaffolds in the brain. In transgenic mice that express human α-synucleinA53T (a mutant protein responsible for familial PD); loss of Sept4 significantlyenhances neuropathology and locomotor deterioration. In this PD model; insoluble depositsof Ser129-phosphorylated α-synucleinA53T are negatively correlated with the dosage of …,Neuron,2007,139

Mice lacking a functional GSK-3α gene were engineered in ourlaboratory; they are viable and display insulin sensitivity. In this study; we havecharacterized brain functions of GSK-3α KO mice by using a well-established battery ofbehavioral tests together with neurochemical and neuroanatomical analysis. Similar to thepreviously described behaviours of GSK-3β+/-mice; GSK-3α mutants display decreasedexploratory activity; decreased immobility time and reduced aggressive behavior. However;genetic inactivation of the GSK-3α gene was associated with: decreased locomotion andimpaired motor coordination; increased grooming activity; loss of social motivation and …,Molecular brain,2009,138
Reversal of hippocampal neuronal maturation by serotonergic antidepressants,Katsunori Kobayashi; Yumiko Ikeda; Atsushi Sakai; Nobuyuki Yamasaki; Eisuke Haneda; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Hidenori Suzuki,Abstract Serotonergic antidepressant drugs have been commonly used to treat mood andanxiety disorders; and increasing evidence suggests potential use of these drugs beyondcurrent antidepressant therapeutics. Facilitation of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampaldentate gyrus has been suggested to be a candidate mechanism of action of antidepressantdrugs; but this mechanism may be only one of the broad effects of antidepressants. Here weshow a distinct unique action of the serotonergic antidepressant fluoxetine in transformingthe phenotype of mature dentate granule cells. Chronic treatments of adult mice withfluoxetine strongly reduced expression of the mature granule cell marker calbindin.

Behavioral profiles of three C57BL/6 substrains,Naoki Matsuo; Keizo Takao; Kazuo Nakanishi; Nobuyuki Yamasaki; Koichi Tanda; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,C57BL/6 inbred strains of mice are widely used in knockout and transgenic research. Toevaluate the loss-of-function and gain-of-function effects of the gene of interest; animalbehaviors are often examined. However; an issue of C57BL/6 substrains that is not alwaysappreciated is that behaviors are known to be strongly influenced by genetic background. Toinvestigate the behavioral characteristics of C57BL/6 substrains; we subjected C57BL/6J;C57BL/6N; and C57BL/6C mice to a behavior test battery. We performed both a regular-scale analysis; in which experimental conditions were tightly-controlled; and meta-analysisfrom large number of behavioral data that we have collected so far through thecomprehensive behavioral test battery applied to 700-2;200 mice in total.

Enhanced cocaine responsiveness and impaired motor coordination in metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 2 knockout mice,Yosuke Morishima; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Tomoyuki Furuyashiki; Yasuhiro Tanaka; Hiroshi Mizuma; Shigetada Nakanishi,Abstract Extensive pharmacological studies have recently emerged indicating that group 2metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) comprising mGluR2 and mGluR3 subtypes areassociated with several neurological and psychiatric disorders. mGluR2 is widely distributedboth presynaptically and postsynaptically in a variety of neuronal cells; but the physiologicalrole of mGluR2 in brain function is poorly understood. This investigation involves acomprehensive behavioral analysis of mGluR2–/–knockout (KO) mice to explore thephysiological role of mGluR2 in brain function. Although; under general observation;mGluR2–/–KO mice appeared to have no behavioral abnormalities; they exhibited severallines of behavioral alterations in the enforcing and defined behavioral tests.

Impaired long-term memory retention and working memory in sdy mutant mice with a deletion in Dtnbp1; a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia,Keizo Takao; Keiko Toyama; Kazuo Nakanishi; Satoko Hattori; Hironori Takamura; Masatoshi Takeda; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Ryota Hashimoto,Schizophrenia is a complex genetic disorder caused by multiple genetic and environmentalfactors. The dystrobrevin-binding protein 1 (DTNBP1: dysbindin-1) gene is a majorsusceptibility gene for schizophrenia. Genetic variations in DTNBP1 are associated withcognitive functions; general cognitive ability and memory function; and clinical features ofpatients with schizophrenia including negative symptoms and cognitive decline. Sincereduced expression of dysbindin-1 has been observed in postmortem brains of patients withschizophrenia; the sandy (sdy) mouse; which has a deletion in the Dtnbp1 gene andexpresses no dysbindin-1 protein; could be an animal model of schizophrenia. To addressthis issue; we have carried out a comprehensive behavioral analysis of the sdy mouse in thisstudy. In a rotarod test; sdy mice did not exhibit motor learning whilst the wild type mice …,Molecular brain,2008,111
Dissection of hippocampal dentate gyrus from adult mouse,Hideo Hagihara; Keiko Toyama; Nobuyuki Yamasaki; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,Abstract The hippocampus is one of the most widely studied areas in the brain because of itsimportant functional role in memory processing and learning; its remarkable neuronal cellplasticity; and its involvement in epilepsy; neurodegenerative diseases; and psychiatricdisorders. The hippocampus is composed of distinct regions; the dentate gyrus; whichcomprises mainly granule neurons; and Ammon's horn; which comprises mainly pyramidalneurons; and the two regions are connected by both anatomic and functional circuits. Manydifferent mRNAs and proteins are selectively expressed in the dentate gyrus; and thedentate gyrus is a site of adult neurogenesis; that is; new neurons are continually generatedin the adult dentate gyrus. To investigate mRNA and protein expression specific to thedentate gyrus; laser capture microdissection is often used. This method has some …,Journal of visualized experiments: JoVE,2009,109

M 1-M 5 muscarinic receptor knockout mice as novel tools to study the physiological roles of the muscarinic cholinergic system,J Wess; A Duttaroy; W Zhang; J Gomeza; Y Cui; T Miyakawa; FP Bymaster; L McKinzie; CC Felder; KG Lamping; FM Faraci; C Deng; M Yamada,A large body of evidence indicates that muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) playcritical roles in regulating the activity of many important functions of the central andperipheral nervous systems. However; identification of the physiological andpathophysiological roles of the individual mAChR subtypes (M 1-M 5) has proven a difficulttask; primarily due to the lack of ligands endowed with a high degree of receptor subtypeselectivity and the fact that most tissues and organs express multiple mAChRs. Tocircumvent these difficulties; we used gene targeting technology to generate mutant mouselines containing inactivating mutations of the M 1-M 5 mAChR genes.

In humans; abnormal NOS/nitric oxidemetabolism is suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of someneuropsychiatric disorders; such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Mice with targeteddisruption of the nNOS gene exhibit abnormal behaviors. Here; we subjected nNOSknockout (KO) mice to a battery of behavioral tests to further investigate the role of nNOS inneuropsychiatric functions. We also examined the role of nNOS in dopamine/DARPP-32signaling in striatal slices from nNOS KO mice and the effects of the administration of adopamine D1 receptor agonist on behavior in nNOS KO mice. nNOS KO mice showedhyperlocomotor activity in a novel environment; increased social interaction in their home …,Molecular brain,2009,87
Identification of YWHAE; a gene encoding 14-3-3epsilon; as a possible susceptibility gene for schizophrenia,Masashi Ikeda; Takao Hikita; Shinichiro Taya; Junko Uraguchi-Asaki; Kazuhito Toyo-Oka; Anthony Wynshaw-Boris; Hiroshi Ujike; Toshiya Inada; Keizo Takao; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Norio Ozaki; Kozo Kaibuchi; Nakao Iwata,Abstract Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder with a fairly high degree of heritability.Although the causes of schizophrenia remain unclear; it is now widely accepted that it is aneurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorder involving disconnectivity and disorderof the synapses. Disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) is a promising candidatesusceptibility gene involved in neurodevelopment; including maturation of the cerebralcortex. To identify other susceptibility genes for schizophrenia; we screened for DISC1-interacting molecules [NudE-like (NUDEL); Lissencephaly-1 (LIS1); 14-3-3epsilon(YWHAE); growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (GRB2) and Kinesin family 5A of Kinesen1(KIF5A)]; assessing a total of 25 tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in aJapanese population.

Increased fearfulness of Fyn tyrosine kinase deficient mice,Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Takeshi Yagi; Satoshi Watanabe; Hiroaki Niki,Abstract Fyn-deficient mice were produced by inserting the β-galactosidase gene (lacZ) intothe fyn gene locus. The homozygously Fyn kinase-deficient (fyn z/fyn z) mice exhibitedstronger light aversion in the light-dark choice test and higher fear-response scores in thenovelty preference and passive avoidance tests than did the heterozygously Fyn-deficient(+/fyn z) mice. These results indicate that fyn z/fyn z mice are hyperresponsive to fear-inducing stimuli.,Molecular brain research,1994,87
Enriched environments influence depression-related behavior in adult mice and the survival of newborn cells in their hippocampi,Satoko Hattori; Ryota Hashimoto; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Hajime Yamanaka; Hiroshi Maeno; Keiji Wada; Hiroshi Kunugi,Abstract Major depression is a highly prevalent mental disorder and environmental factorshave been strongly implicated in its pathophysiology. Clinical studies have demonstratedthat stress or depression can lead to atrophy and cell loss in the hippocampus. Studies ofanimal models of depression have suggested that reduced neurogenesis in the adulthippocampus might contribute to such structural changes and to the behavior of theseanimals. On the other hand; increased hippocampal neurogenesis can be induced by theadministration of antidepressants or electroconvulsive seizure; suggesting that increasedneurogenesis might be related to the treatment of depression. Thus; an enrichedenvironment (EE); which also enhances neurogenesis; is expected to have therapeuticeffects on depression-related behaviors. To investigate the effects of an EE during …,Behavioural brain research,2007,84

Although genes related to immunity are implicated inschizophrenia; there has been no study showing that their mutation or knockout (KO) resultsin schizophrenia. Here; we show that Shn-2 KO mice have behavioral abnormalities thatresemble those of schizophrenics. The mutant brain demonstrated multiple schizophrenia-related phenotypes; including transcriptome/proteome changes similar to those ofpostmortem schizophrenia patients; decreased parvalbumin and GAD67 levels; increasedtheta power on electroencephalograms; and a thinner cortex.

Increased social interaction in mice deficient of the striatal medium spiny neuron‐specific phosphodiesterase 10A2,Hiromi Sano; Yumiko Nagai; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Ryuichi Shigemoto; Mineto Yokoi,Abstract Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) is a member ofphosphodiesterase families that degrade cAMP and/or cGMP in distinct intracellular sites.PDE10A has a dual activity on hydrolysis of both cAMP and cGMP; and is prominentlyexpressed in the striatum and the testis. Previous studies suggested that PDE10A isinvolved in regulation of locomotor activity and potentially related to psychosis; but concretephysiological roles of PDE10A remains elusive yet. In this study; we genetically inactivatedPDE10A2; a prominent isoform of PDE10A in the brain; in mice; and demonstrate thatPDE10A2 deficiency results in increased social interaction without any major influence ondifferent other behaviors; along with increased levels of striatal cAMP. We also demonstratethat PDE10A2 is selectively distributed in medium spiny neurons; but not interneurons; of …,Journal of neurochemistry,2008,80
Light/dark transition test for mice,Keizo Takao; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,Abstract Although all of the mouse genome sequences have been determined; we do not yetknow the functions of most of these genes. Gene-targeting techniques; however; can beused to delete or manipulate a specific gene in mice. The influence of a given gene on aspecific behavior can then be determined by conducting behavioral analyses of the mutantmice. As a test for behavioral phenotyping of mutant mice; the light/dark transition test is oneof the most widely used tests to measure anxiety-like behavior in mice. The test is based onthe natural aversion of mice to brightly illuminated areas and on their spontaneousexploratory behavior in novel environments. The test is sensitive to anxiolytic drug treatment.The apparatus consists of a dark chamber and a brightly illuminated chamber. Mice areallowed to move freely between the two chambers. The number of entries into the bright …,Journal of visualized experiments: JoVE,2006,79
Detection of an immature dentate gyrus feature in human schizophrenia/bipolar patients,NM Walton; Y Zhou; JH Kogan; R Shin; M Webster; AK Gross; CL Heusner; Q Chen; S Miyake; K Tajinda; K Tamura; T Miyakawa; M Matsumoto,Abstract Hippocampus-associated cognitive impairments are a common; highly conservedsymptom of both schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BPD). Although thehippocampus is likely an impacted region in SCZ/BPD patients; the molecular and cellularunderpinnings of these impairments are difficult to identify. An emerging class of mousemodels for these psychiatric diseases display similar cognitive impairments to thoseobserved in human patients. The hippocampi of these mice possess a conservedpathophysiological alteration; we term the 'immature dentate gyrus'(iDG); characterized byincreased numbers of calretinin-positive immature neuronal progenitors; a dearth ofcalbindin-positive mature neurons and (often) constitutively increased neurogenesis.Although these models provide a link between cellular dysfunction and behavioral …,Translational psychiatry,2012,74
Radial maze performance; open-field and elevated plus-maze behaviors in Fyn-kinase deficient mice: further evidence for increased fearfulness,Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Takeshi Yagi; Akira Kagiyama; Hiroaki Niki,Abstract Fyn-deficient mice produced by inserting the β-galactosidase gene (lacZ) into thefyn gene locus were tested in a radial maze; an open field and an elevated plus-maze. In theradial maze; the homozygous Fyn-deficient (fyn z fyn z) mice showed no impairment inspatial learning; although they showed a stronger avoidance tendency for those armslocated closer to the experimenter during pretraining (adaptation). In the open-field test; thefyn z fyn z mice defecated more frequently in the bright condition than did the+ fyn z mice;and they were less active during the first 10-min test period than the+ fyn z mice. In addition;the temporal pattern of locomotor activity for fyn z fyn z mice was altered by changing theillumination while the pattern for+ fyn z mice remained relatively unchanged. Scoresreflecting the fear-response in the elevated plus-maze were higher in the fyn z fyn z mice …,Molecular brain research,1996,72
Decreased exploratory activity in a mouse model of 15q duplication syndrome; implications for disturbance of serotonin signaling,Kota Tamada; Shozo Tomonaga; Fumiyuki Hatanaka; Nobuhiro Nakai; Keizo Takao; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Jin Nakatani; Toru Takumi,Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have garnered significant attention as an importantgrouping of developmental brain disorders. Recent genomic studies have revealed thatinherited or de novo copy number variations (CNVs) are significantly involved in thepathophysiology of ASDs. In a previous report from our laboratory; we generated mice withCNVs as a model of ASDs; with a duplicated mouse chromosome 7C that is orthologous tohuman chromosome 15q11-13. Behavioral analyses revealed paternally duplicated(patDp/+) mice displayed abnormal behaviors resembling the symptoms of ASDs. In thepresent study; we extended these findings by performing various behavioral tests withC57BL/6J patDp/+ mice; and comprehensively measuring brain monoamine levels with exvivo high performance liquid chromatography.

Impact of brain-behavior phenotypying of genetically-engineered mice on research of neuropsychiatric disorders,Keizo Takao; Nobuyuki Yamasaki; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,Abstract Despite massive research efforts; the exact pathogenesis and pathophysiology ofpsychiatric disorders; such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; remain largely unknown.Animal models can serve as essential tools for investigating the etiology and treatment ofsuch disorders. Since the introduction of gene targeting techniques; the functions of morethan 10% of all known mouse genes have been investigated by creating mutant mice. Someof these mutant mouse strains were found to exhibit behavioral abnormalities reminiscent ofhuman psychiatric disorders. In this review; we discuss the general requirements for animalmodels of human psychiatric disorders. We also outline our unique approach ofextrapolating findings in mice to humans; and present studies on forebrain-specificcalcineurin knockout mice as an example. We also discuss the impact of a large-scale …,Neuroscience research,2007,66
Nardilysin regulates axonal maturation and myelination in the central and peripheral nervous system,Mikiko Ohno; Yoshinori Hiraoka; Tatsuhiko Matsuoka; Hidekazu Tomimoto; Keizo Takao; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Naoko Oshima; Hiroshi Kiyonari; Takeshi Kimura; Toru Kita; Eiichiro Nishi,Abstract Axonal maturation and myelination are essential processes for establishing anefficient neuronal signaling network. We found that nardilysin (N-arginine dibasicconvertase; also known as Nrd1 and NRDc); a metalloendopeptidase enhancer of proteinectodomain shedding; is a critical regulator of these processes. Nrd1−/− mice had smallerbrains and a thin cerebral cortex; in which there were less myelinated fibers with thinnermyelin sheaths and smaller axon diameters. We also found hypomyelination in theperipheral nervous system (PNS) of Nrd1−/− mice. Neuron-specific overexpression of NRDcinduced hypermyelination; indicating that the level of neuronal NRDc regulates myelinthickness. Consistent with these findings; Nrd1−/− mice had impaired motor activities andcognitive deficits. Furthermore; NRDc enhanced ectodomain shedding of neuregulin1 …,Nature neuroscience,2009,60
Inhibition of calpain increases LIS1 expression and partially rescues in vivo phenotypes in a mouse model of lissencephaly,Masami Yamada; Yuko Yoshida; Daisuke Mori; Takako Takitoh; Mineko Kengaku; Hiroki Umeshima; Keizo Takao; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Makoto Sato; Hiroyuki Sorimachi; Anthony Wynshaw-Boris; Shinji Hirotsune,Abstract Lissencephaly is a devastating neurological disorder caused by defective neuronalmigration. LIS1 (official symbol PAFAH1B1; for platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase;isoform 1b; subunit 1) was identified as the gene mutated in individuals with lissencephaly;and it was found to regulate cytoplasmic dynein function and localization. Here we show thatinhibition or knockdown of calpains protects LIS1 from proteolysis; resulting in theaugmentation of LIS1 amounts in Lis1+/− mouse embryonic fibroblast cells and rescue of theaberrant distribution of cytoplasmic dynein; mitochondria and β-COP–positive vesicles. Wealso show that calpain inhibitors improve neuronal migration of Lis1+/− cerebellar granularneurons. Intraperitoneal injection of the calpain inhibitor ALLN to pregnant Lis1+/− damsrescued apoptotic neuronal cell death and neuronal migration defects in Lis1+/− offspring …,Nature medicine,2009,60
Orexin receptor-1 in the locus coeruleus plays an important role in cue-dependent fear memory consolidation,Shingo Soya; Hirotaka Shoji; Emi Hasegawa; Mari Hondo; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Masashi Yanagisawa; Michihiro Mieda; Takeshi Sakurai,The noradrenergic (NA) projections arising from the locus ceruleus (LC) to the amygdalaand bed nucleus of the stria terminalis have been implicated in the formation of emotionalmemory. Since NA neurons in the LC (LC-NA neurons) abundantly express orexin receptor-1 (OX1R) and receive prominent innervation by orexin-producing neurons; we hypothesizedthat an OX1R-mediated pathway is involved in the physiological fear learning process viaregulation of LC-NA neurons. To evaluate this hypothesis; we examined the phenotype ofOx1r−/− mice in the classic cued and contextual fear-conditioning test. We found thatOx1r−/− mice showed impaired freezing responses in both cued and contextual fear-conditioning paradigms. In contrast; Ox2r−/− mice showed normal freezing behavior in thecued fear-conditioning test; while they exhibited shorter freezing time in the contextual …,Journal of Neuroscience,2013,57
P301S mutant human tau transgenic mice manifest early symptoms of human tauopathies with dementia and altered sensorimotor gating,Hiroki Takeuchi; Michiyo Iba; Haruhisa Inoue; Makoto Higuchi; Keizo Takao; Kayoko Tsukita; Yoshiko Karatsu; Yumiko Iwamoto; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Tetsuya Suhara; John Q Trojanowski; Virginia M-Y Lee; Ryosuke Takahashi,Tauopathies are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation ofabnormal tau protein leading to cognitive and/or motor dysfunction. To understand therelationship between tau pathology and behavioral impairments; we comprehensivelyassessed behavioral abnormalities in a mouse tauopathy model expressing the humanP301S mutant tau protein in the early stage of disease to detect its initial neurologicalmanifestations. Behavioral abnormalities; shown by open field test; elevated plus-maze test;hot plate test; Y-maze test; Barnes maze test; Morris water maze test; and/or contextual fearconditioning test; recapitulated the neurological deficits of human tauopathies withdementia. Furthermore; we discovered that prepulse inhibition (PPI); a marker ofsensorimotor gating; was enhanced in these animals concomitantly with initial …,PloS one,2011,55

However; how myelinatingoligodendrocytes regulate CV; and what the significance of this regulation is for normal brainfunction remain unknown. To address these questions; we analyzed a transgenic mouseline harboring extra copies of the myelin proteolipid protein 1 (plp1) gene (plp1 tg/− mice) at2 months of age. At this stage; the plp1 tg/− mice have an unaffected myelin structure with anormally appearing ion channel distribution; but the CV in all axonal tracts tested in the CNSis greatly reduced. We also found decreased axonal diameters and slightly abnormalparanodal structures; both of which can be a cause for the reduced CV. Interestingly the plp1tg/− mice showed altered anxiety-like behaviors; reduced prepulse inhibitions; spatial …,Journal of Neuroscience,2009,54
Immature dentate gyrus: an endophenotype of neuropsychiatric disorders,Hideo Hagihara; Keizo Takao; Noah M Walton; Mitsuyuki Matsumoto; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,Adequate maturation of neurons and their integration into the hippocampal circuit is crucialfor normal cognitive function and emotional behavior; and disruption of this process couldcause disturbances in mental health. Previous reports have shown that mice heterozygousfor a null mutation in α-CaMKII; which encodes a key synaptic plasticity molecule; displayabnormal behaviors related to schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. In thesemutants; almost all neurons in the dentate gyrus are arrested at a pseudoimmature state atthe molecular and electrophysiological levels; a phenomenon defined as “immature dentategyrus (iDG).” To date; the iDG phenotype and shared behavioral abnormalities (includingworking memory deficit and hyperlocomotor activity) have been discovered in Schnurri-2knockout; mutant SNAP-25 knock-in; and forebrain-specific calcineurin knockout mice.

Age-related changes in behavior in C57BL/6J mice from young adulthood to middle age,Hirotaka Shoji; Keizo Takao; Satoko Hattori; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,Aging is considered to be associated with progressive changes in the brain and itsassociated sensory; motor; and cognitive functions. A large number of studies comparingyoung and aged animals have reported differences in various behaviors between age-cohorts; indicating behavioral dysfunctions related to aging. However; relatively little isknown about behavioral changes from young adulthood to middle age; and the effect of ageon behavior during the early stages of life remains to be understood. In order to investigateage-related changes in the behaviors of mice from young adulthood to middle age; weperformed a large-scale analysis of the behavioral data obtained from our behavioral testbattery involving 1739 C57BL/6J wild-type mice at 2–12 months of age.

Fluoxetine-induced cortical adult neurogenesis,Koji Ohira; Rika Takeuchi; Hirotaka Shoji; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,Abstract Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal subgranular zone (SGZ) and the anteriorsubventricular zone (SVZ) is regulated by multiple factors; including neurotransmitters;hormones; stress; aging; voluntary exercise; environmental enrichment; learning; andischemia. Chronic treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) modulatesadult neurogenesis in the SGZ; the neuronal area that is hypothesized to mediate theantidepressant effects of these substances. Layer 1 inhibitory neuron progenitor cells (L1-INP cells) were recently identified in the adult cortex; but it remains unclear what factorsother than ischemia affect the neurogenesis of L1-INP cells. Here; we show that chronictreatment with an SSRI; fluoxetine (FLX); stimulated the neurogenesis of γ-aminobutyric acid(GABA) ergic interneurons from L1-INP cells in the cortex of adult mice …,Neuropsychopharmacology,2013,51

We have now investigated the role of FEZ1 in braindevelopment and the pathogenesis of schizophrenia by generating mice that lack Fez1.Immunofluorescence staining revealed FEZ1 to be located predominantly in γ-aminobutyricacid-containing interneurons. The Fez1−/− mice showed marked hyperactivity in a variety ofbehavioral tests as well as enhanced behavioral responses to the psychostimulants MK-801and methamphetamine.

Comprehensive behavioral phenotyping of calpastatin-knockout mice,Ryuichi Nakajima; Keizo Takao; Shu-Ming Huang; Jiro Takano; Nobuhisa Iwata; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Takaomi C Saido,Calpastatin is an endogenous inhibitor of calpain; intracellular calcium-activated protease. Ithas been suggested to be involved in molecular mechanisms of long-term plasticity andexcitotoxic pathways. However; functions of calpastatin in vivo are still largely unknown. Toexamine the physiological roles of calpastatin; we subjected calpastatin-knockout mice to acomprehensive behavioral test battery. Calpastatin-knockout mice showed decreasedlocomotor activity under stressful environments; and decreased acoustic startle response;but we observed no significant change in hippocampus-dependent memory function. Theseresults suggest that calpastatin is likely to be more closely associated with affective ratherthan cognitive aspects of brain function.,Molecular brain,2008,49
Down‐regulation of protocadherin‐α A isoforms in mice changes contextual fear conditioning and spatial working memory,Emi Fukuda; Shun Hamada; Sonoko Hasegawa; Shota Katori; Makoto Sanbo; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Toshifumi Yamamoto; Hideko Yamamoto; Takahiro Hirabayashi; Takeshi Yagi,Abstract Diverse protocadherins (Pcdhs); which are encoded as a large cluster (composedof α; β and γ clusters) in the genome; are localized to axons and synapses. The Pcdhs havebeen proposed to contribute to the generation of sophisticated neural networks and toregulate brain function. To address the molecular roles of Pcdhs in regulating individualbehavior; here we generated knockdown mice of Pcdh-α proteins and examined theirbehavioral abnormalities. There are two alternative splicing variants of the Pcdh-α constantregion; Pcdh-α A and B isoforms; with different cytoplasmic tails. Pcdh-α ΔBneo/ΔBneo mice;in which the Pcdh-α B splicing variant was absent and the Pcdh-α A isoforms were down-regulated to approximately 20% of the wild-type level; exhibited enhanced contextual fearconditioning and disparities in an eight-arm radial maze.

Investigating Gene‐to‐Behavior Pathways in Psychiatric Disorders,Keizo Takao; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,Abstract: We have been investigating the relationships between genes and behaviors byconducting a systematic and well-defined behavioral test battery with mice that have amutation on a gene of interest. The behavioral test battery covers a relatively broad range ofvarious behavioral domains such as learning and memory; sensory-motor functions;emotion; motivation; and drug sensitivity/preference. Recently; we subjected mice lackingcalcineurin (CN); a calcium/calmodulin protein phosphatase; to the comprehensivebehavioral test battery. The mutant mice had a severe working memory deficit; increasedlocomotor activity; decreased social interaction; and impairments in prepulse and latentinhibition. The abnormalities of CN mutant mice were strikingly similar to those described forschizophrenic patients. Consistent with these findings; human genetics studies in a large …,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2006,47

Genetic ablation of NMDA receptor subunit NR3B in mouse reveals motoneuronal and nonmotoneuronal phenotypes,Stephan Niemann; Hiroaki Kanki; Yasuyuki Fukui; Keizo Takao; Masahiro Fukaya; Meri N Hynynen; Michael J Churchill; Jeremy M Shefner; Roderick T Bronson; Robert H Brown; Masahiko Watanabe; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Shigeyoshi Itohara; Yasunori Hayashi,Abstract NR3B is a modulatory subunit of the NMDA receptor; abundantly expressed in bothcranial and spinal somatic motoneurons and at lower levels in other regions of the brain aswell. Recently; we found the human NR3B gene (GRIN3B) to be highly geneticallyheterogeneous; and that∼ 10% of the normal European-American population lacks NR3Bdue to homozygous occurrence of a null allele in the gene. Therefore; it is especiallyimportant to understand the phenotypic consequences of the genetic loss of NR3B in bothhumans and animal models. We here provide results of behavioral analysis of micegenetically lacking NR3B; which is an ideal animal model due to homogeneity in geneticand environmental background. The NR3B–/–mice are viable and fertile. Consistent with theexpression of NR3B in somatic motoneurons; the NR3B–/–mice showed a moderate but …,European Journal of Neuroscience,2007,43
Comprehensive behavioral analysis of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) knockout mice,Satoko Hattori; Keizo Takao; Koichi Tanda; Keiko Toyama; Norihito Shintani; Akemichi Baba; Hitoshi Hashimoto; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a neuropeptide acting as aneurotransmitter; neuromodulator; or neurotrophic factor. PACAP is widely expressedthroughout the brain and exerts its functions through the PACAP-specific receptor (PAC1).Recent studies reveal that genetic variants of the PACAP and PAC1 genes are associatedwith mental disorders; and several behavioral abnormalities of PACAP knockout (KO) miceare reported. However; an insufficient number of backcrosses was made using PACAP KOmice on the C57BL/6J background due to their postnatal mortality. To elucidate the effects ofPACAP on neuropsychiatric function; the PACAP gene was knocked out in F1 hybrid mice(C57BL/6J x 129SvEv) for appropriate control of the genetic background. The PACAP KOmice were then subjected to a behavioral test battery. PACAP deficiency had no …,Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2012,42

Acceleration of visually cued conditioned fear through the auditory pathway,Jessica R Newton; Charlene Ellsworth; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Susumu Tonegawa; Mriganka Sur,Abstract Defensive responses elicited by sensory experiences are critical for survival. Miceacquire a conditioned fear response rapidly to an auditory cue but slowly to a visual cue; adifference in learned behavior that is likely to be mediated by direct projections to the lateralamygdala from the auditory thalamus but mainly indirect ones from the visual thalamus.Here; we show that acquisition of visually cued conditioned fear is acceleratedin'rewired'mice that have retinal projections routed to the auditory thalamus. Visual stimuliinduce expression of the immediate early gene Fos (also known as c-fos) in the auditorythalamus and the lateral amygdala in rewired mice; similar to the way auditory stimuli do incontrol mice. Thus; the rewired auditory pathway conveys visual information and mediatesrapid activity-dependent plasticity in central structures that influence learned behavior.,Nature neuroscience,2004,38
Right‐hemispheric dominance of spatial memory in split‐brain mice,Yoshiaki Shinohara; Aki Hosoya; Nobuyuki Yamasaki; Hassan Ahmed; Satoko Hattori; Megumi Eguchi; Shun Yamaguchi; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Hajime Hirase; Ryuichi Shigemoto,Abstract Left-right asymmetry of human brain function has been known for a century;although much of molecular and cellular basis of brain laterality remains to be elusive.Recent studies suggest that hippocampal CA3-CA1 excitatory synapses are asymmetricallyarranged; however; the functional implication of the asymmetrical circuitry has not beenstudied at the behavioral level. In order to address the left-right asymmetry of hippocampalfunction in behaving mice; we analyzed the performance of “split-brain” mice in the Barnesmaze. The “split-brain” mice received ventral hippocampal commissure and corpus callosumtransection in addition to deprivation of visual input from one eye. In such mice; thehippocampus in the side of visual deprivation receives sensory-driven input. Better spatialtask performance was achieved by the mice which were forced to use the right …,Hippocampus,2012,37
Relaxin-3-deficient mice showed slight alteration in anxiety-related behavior,Yoshihisa Watanabe; Atsushi Tsujimura; Keizo Takao; Kazunori Nishi; Yasuaki Ito; Yoshitaka Yasuhara; Yasuhito Nakatomi; Chihiro Yokoyama; Kenji Fukui; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Masaki Tanaka,Relaxin-3 is a neuropeptide belonging to the relaxin/insulin superfamily. Studies usingrodents have revealed that relaxin-3 is predominantly expressed in neurons in the nucleusincertus of the pons; the axons of which project to forebrain regions including thehypothalamus. There is evidence that relaxin-3 is involved in several functions; includingfood intake and stress responses. In the present study; we generated relaxin-3 geneknockout (KO) mice and examined them using a range of behavioral tests of sensory/motorfunctions and emotion-related behaviors. The results revealed that relaxin-3 KO miceexhibited normal growth and appearance; and were generally indistinguishable from wildgenotype littermates. There was no difference in bodyweight among genotypes until at least28 weeks after birth. In addition; there were no significant differences between wild-type …,Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2011,37
Chronic fluoxetine treatment reduces parvalbumin expression and perineuronal netsin gamma-aminobutyric acidergic interneurons of the frontal cortex in adultmice,Koji Ohira; Rika Takeuchi; Tsuyoshi Iwanaga; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FLX) is widely used totreat depressionand anxiety disorders; but cellular mechanisms underlyingthe antidepressant effect of FLXremain largely unknown. The generallyaccepted effect of chronic FLX treatment is increasedadult neurogenesis inthe hippocampal dentate gyrus. It was recently demonstrated thatFLXtreatments can reverse the established neuronal maturation of granule cellsin thehippocampal dentate gyrus and of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) interneuronsin the basolateral amygdala. However; it is notclear whether this dematuration effect of FLXoccurs in other brain regions. Thus; in this study; we used immunohistological analysis toassess theeffect of FLX treatment on GABAergic interneurons in the medial frontalcortex(mFC) and reticular thalamic nucleus (RTN).

T-maze Forced Alternation and Left-right Discrimination Tasks for Assessing Working and Reference Memory in Mice,Shoji Hirotaka; Hagihara Hideo; Takao Keizo; Hattori Satoko; Miyakawa Tsuyoshi,Abstract Forced alternation and left-right discrimination tasks using the T-maze have beenwidely used to assess working and reference memory; respectively; in rodents. In ourlaboratory; we evaluated the two types of memory in more than 30 strains of geneticallyengineered mice using the automated version of this apparatus. Here; we present themodified T-maze apparatus operated by a computer with a video-tracking system and ourprotocols in a movie format. The T-maze apparatus consists of runways partitioned off bysliding doors that can automatically open downward; each with a start box; a T-shaped alley;two boxes with automatic pellet dispensers at one side of the box; and two L-shaped alleys.Each L-shaped alley is connected to the start box so that mice can return to the start box;which excludes the effects of experimenter handling on mouse behavior.

Mechanisms for interferon-α-induced depression and neural stem cell dysfunction,Lian-Shun Zheng; Seiji Hitoshi; Naoko Kaneko; Keizo Takao; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Yasuhito Tanaka; Hongjing Xia; Ulrich Kalinke; Koutaro Kudo; Shigenobu Kanba; Kazuhiro Ikenaka; Kazunobu Sawamoto,Summary New neurons generated by the neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adulthippocampus play an important role in emotional regulation and respond to the action ofantidepressants. Depression is a common and serious side effect of interferon-α (IFN-α);which limits its use as an antiviral and antitumor drug. However; the mechanism (s)underlying IFN-induced depression are largely unknown. Using a comprehensive battery ofbehavioral tests; we found that mice subjected to IFN-α treatment exhibited a depression-likephenotype. IFN-α directly suppressed NSC proliferation; resulting in the reduced generationof new neurons. Brain-specific mouse knockout of the IFN-α receptor prevented IFN-α-induced depressive behavioral phenotypes and the inhibition of neurogenesis; suggestingthat IFN-α suppresses hippocampal neurogenesis and induces depression via its …,Stem cell reports,2014,34
Comprehensive behavioural study of GluR4 knockout mice: implication in cognitive function,N Sagata; A Iwaki; T Aramaki; K Takao; S Kura; T Tsuzuki; R Kawakami; I Ito; T Kitamura; H Sugiyama; T Miyakawa; Y Fukumaki,Abstract Fast excitatory transmission in the mammalian central nervous system is mediatedby AMPA-type glutamate receptors. The tetrameric AMPA receptor complexes are composedof four subunits; GluR1–4. The GluR4 subunit is highly expressed in the cerebellum and theearly postnatal hippocampus and is thought to be involved in synaptic plasticity and thedevelopment of functional neural circuitry through the recruitment of other AMPA receptorsubunits. Previously; we reported an association of the human GluR4 gene (GRIA4) withschizophrenia. To examine the role of the GluR4 subunit in the higher brain function; wegenerated GluR4 knockout mice and conducted electrophysiological and behaviouralanalyses. The mutant mice showed normal long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region ofthe hippocampus. The GluR4 knockout mice showed mildly improved spatial working …,Genes; Brain and Behavior,2010,34

CHD8 haploinsufficiency results in autistic-like phenotypes in mice,Yuta Katayama; Masaaki Nishiyama; Hirotaka Shoji; Yasuyuki Ohkawa; Atsuki Kawamura; Tetsuya Sato; Mikita Suyama; Toru Takumi; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Keiichi I Nakayama,Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) comprises a range of neurodevelopmentaldisorders characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication as well as byrestricted and repetitive behaviours 1. ASD has a strong genetic component with highheritability. Exome sequencing analysis has recently identified many de novo mutations in avariety of genes in individuals with ASD 2; 3; with CHD8; a gene encoding a chromatinremodeller; being most frequently affected 4; 5; 6; 7; 8. Whether CHD8 mutations arecausative for ASD and how they might establish ASD traits have remained unknown. Herewe show that mice heterozygous for Chd8 mutations manifest ASD-like behaviouralcharacteristics including increased anxiety; repetitive behaviour; and altered socialbehaviour.

Chronic treatment with fluoxetine for more than 6 weeks decreases neurogenesis in the subventricular zone of adult mice,Koji Ohira; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,Recent studies indicate that chronic treatment with serotonergic antidepressantsupregulates adult neurogenesis of the dentate gyrus (DG). In contrast; some studies claimedthat there was very little alteration of neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) by theantidepressants. Since almost all of those studies treated animals with drugs for 2 to 4weeks as chronic treatment models of antidepressants; it is possible that antidepressanttreatments for longer periods would affect adult neurogenesis in the SVZ. In the presentstudy; we examined the effects of long-term (up to 9 weeks) administration of fluoxetine(FLX); a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; on cell proliferation and survival in the DGand the SVZ of adult mice. As reported previously; in the DG of mice treated with FLX for 3; 6;or 9 weeks that were also injected with 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in the last 3 days …,Molecular brain,2011,33
Expression of tryptophan 2; 3-dioxygenase in mature granule cells of the adult mouse dentate gyrus,Koji Ohira; Hideo Hagihara; Keiko Toyama; Keizo Takao; Masaaki Kanai; Hiroshi Funakoshi; Toshikazu Nakamura; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,New granule cells are continuously generated in the dentate gyrus of the adulthippocampus. During granule cell maturation; the mechanisms that differentiate new cellsnot only describe the degree of cell differentiation; but also crucially regulate the progressionof cell differentiation. Here; we describe a gene; tryptophan 2; 3-dioxygenase (TDO); whoseexpression distinguishes stem cells from more differentiated cells among the granule cells ofthe adult mouse dentate gyrus. The use of markers for proliferation; neural progenitors; andimmature and mature granule cells indicated that TDO was expressed in mature cells and insome immature cells. In mice heterozygous for the alpha-isoform of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; in which dentate gyrus granule cells fail to mature normally;TDO immunoreactivity was substantially downregulated in the dentate gyrus granule cells …,Molecular brain,2010,33
The immature dentate gyrus represents a shared phenotype of mouse models of epilepsy and psychiatric disease,Rick Shin; Katsunori Kobayashi; Hideo Hagihara; Jeffrey H Kogan; Shinichi Miyake; Katsunori Tajinda; Noah M Walton; Adam K Gross; Carrie L Heusner; Qian Chen; Kouichi Tamura; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Mitsuyuki Matsumoto,Objectives There is accumulating evidence to suggest psychiatric disorders; such as bipolardisorder and schizophrenia; share common etiologies; pathophysiologies; genetics; anddrug responses with many of the epilepsies. Here; we explored overlaps incellular/molecular; electrophysiological; and behavioral phenotypes between putativemouse models of bipolar disorder/schizophrenia and epilepsy. We tested the hypothesis thatan immature dentate gyrus (iDG); whose association with psychosis in patients has recentlybeen reported; represents a common phenotype of both diseases.

Astrocytes regulate the activity of neighboringneurons by releasing chemical transmitters (gliotransmitters). However; the precise role ofgilotransmitters in regulating neuronal activity is still under debate. Here; we report that asubtle enhancement in the release of one gliotransmitter; ATP; affects synaptic potentiationfrom an analysis of mice containing an astrocyte-selective (GFAP) mutation. We found that;relative to normal mice; weaker stimulation induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in mutantmice; indicating that the threshold to induce LTP was lowered in the mutant. While excitatorytransmission was normal in the mutant; inhibitory GABAergic transmission was suppressed.We found that a low concentration of adenosine selectively attenuated inhibitory neuronal …,Glia,2013,30
Increased anxiety-like behavior in neuropsin (kallikrein-related peptidase 8) gene-deficient mice.,Yoichiro Horii; Nobuyuki Yamasaki; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Sadao Shiosaka,Abstract Neuropsin (kallikrein-related peptidase 8) is concentrated in the hippocampus;amygdala; olfactory bulb; and prefrontal cortex. Earlier studies showed that proteasedeficiency causes a significant impairment of early-phase long-term potentiation in theSchaffer collateral pathway and hippocampus-dependent memory in the Y maze and Morriswater maze (Z.

SIRT1 overexpression ameliorates a mouse model of SOD1-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis via HSF1/HSP70i chaperone system,Seiji Watanabe; Natsumi Ageta-Ishihara; Shinji Nagatsu; Keizo Takao; Okiru Komine; Fumito Endo; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Hidemi Misawa; Ryosuke Takahashi; Makoto Kinoshita; Koji Yamanaka,Dominant mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) cause degeneration of motorneurons in a subset of inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The pathogeneticprocess mediated by misfolded and/or aggregated mutant SOD1 polypeptides ishypothesized to be suppressed by protein refolding. This genetic study is aimed to testwhether mutant SOD1-mediated ALS pathology recapitulated in mice could be alleviated byoverexpressing a longevity-related deacetylase SIRT1 whose substrates include atranscription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1); the master regulator of the chaperonesystem. We established a line of transgenic mice that chronically overexpress SIRT1 in thebrain and spinal cord. While inducible HSP70 (HSP70i) was upregulated in the spinal cordof SIRT1 transgenic mice (PrP-Sirt1); no neurological and behavioral alterations were …,Molecular brain,2014,29
Contextual and cued fear conditioning test using a video analyzing system in mice,Hirotaka Shoji; Keizo Takao; Satoko Hattori; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,Abstract The contextual and cued fear conditioning test is one of the behavioral tests thatassesses the ability of mice to learn and remember an association between environmentalcues and aversive experiences. In this test; mice are placed into a conditioning chamber andare given parings of a conditioned stimulus (an auditory cue) and an aversive unconditionedstimulus (an electric footshock). After a delay time; the mice are exposed to the sameconditioning chamber and a differently shaped chamber with presentation of the auditorycue. Freezing behavior during the test is measured as an index of fear memory. To analyzethe behavior automatically; we have developed a video analyzing system using the ImageFZapplication software program; which is available as a free download at http://www. mouse-phenotype. org/. Here; to show the details of our protocol; we demonstrate our procedure …,Journal of visualized experiments: JoVE,2014,28

Growing evidence suggests that SNAP-25 is involved in neuropsychiatricdisorders; such as schizophrenia; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; and epilepsy.Recently; increases in anxiety-related behaviors and epilepsy have been observed in SNAP-25 knock-in (KI) mice; which have a single amino acid substitution of Ala for Ser187.However; the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the abnormalities in thismutant remain unknown. In this study; we found that a significant number of dentate gyrus(DG) granule cells was histologically and electrophysiologically similar to immature DGneurons in the dentate gyrus of the adult mutants; a phenomenon termed the “immatureDG”(iDG).

Comprehensive behavioral analysis of ENU-induced Disc1-Q31L and-L100P mutant mice,Hirotaka Shoji; Keiko Toyama; Yoshihiro Takamiya; Shigeharu Wakana; Yoichi Gondo; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) is considered to be a candidate susceptibility genefor psychiatric disorders; including schizophrenia; bipolar disorder; and major depression. Arecent study reported that N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutations in exon 2 of themouse Disc1 gene; which resulted in the amino acid exchange of Q31L and L100P; causedan increase in depression-like behavior in 31 L mutant mice and schizophrenia-likebehavior in 100P mutant mice; thus; these are potential animal models of psychiatricdisorders. However; remaining heterozygous mutations that possibly occur in flanking genesother than Disc1 itself might induce behavioral abnormalities in the mutant mice.

Recently; PRICKLE1 missense mutations were found to segregate with ASD.However; the mechanism by which mutations in this gene might contribute to ASD isunknown. To elucidate the role of PRICKLE1 in ASDs; we carried out studies in Prickle1+/−mice and Drosophila; yeast; and neuronal cell lines. We show that mice with Prickle1mutations exhibit ASD-like behaviors. To find proteins that interact with PRICKLE1 in thecentral nervous system; we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with a human brain cDNAlibrary and isolated a peptide with homology to SYNAPSIN I (SYN1); a protein involved insynaptogenesis; synaptic vesicle formation; and regulation of neurotransmitter release …,PloS one,2013,27
Impaired synaptic clustering of postsynaptic density proteins and altered signal transmission in hippocampal neurons; and disrupted learning behavior in PDZ1 and...,Hitoshi Nagura; Yasuyuki Ishikawa; Katsunori Kobayashi; Keizo Takao; Tomo Tanaka; Kouki Nishikawa; Hideki Tamura; Sadao Shiosaka; Hidenori Suzuki; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Yoshinori Fujiyoshi; Tomoko Doi,Postsynaptic density (PSD)-95-like membrane-associated guanylate kinases (PSD-MAGUKs) are scaffold proteins in PSDs that cluster signaling molecules near NMDAreceptors. PSD-MAGUKs share a common domain structure; including three PDZ (PDZ1/2/3)domains in their N-terminus. While multiple domains enable the PSD-MAGUKs to bindvarious ligands; the contribution of each PDZ domain to synaptic organization and functionis not fully understood. Here; we focused on the PDZ1/2 domains of PSD-95 that bind NMDA-type receptors; and studied the specific roles of the ligand binding of these domains in theassembly of PSD proteins; synaptic properties of hippocampal neurons; and behavior; usingligand binding-deficient PSD-95 cDNA knockin (KI) mice.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the response of thebrain to stress remain primarily unknown; however. Signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) is anIg-superfamily protein that undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and binds the proteintyrosine phosphatase Shp2. Here we show that mice expressing a form of SIRPα that lacksmost of the cytoplasmic region manifest prolonged immobility (depression-like behavior) inthe forced swim (FS) test. FS stress induced marked tyrosine phosphorylation of SIRPα inthe brain of wild-type mice through activation of Src family kinases. The SIRPα ligand CD47was important for such SIRPα phosphorylation; and CD47-deficient mice also manifestedprolonged immobility in the FS test.

Mice lacking the kf-1 gene exhibit increased anxiety-but not despair-like behavior,Atsushi Tsujimura; Masato Matsuki; Keizo Takao; Kiyofumi Yamanishi; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Tamotsu Hashimoto-Gotoh,KF-1 was originally identified as a protein encoded by human gene with increasedexpression in the cerebral cortex of a patient with Alzheimer's disease. In mouse brain; kf-1mRNA is detected predominantly in the hippocampus and cerebellum; and kf-1 geneexpression is elevated also in the frontal cortex of rats after chronic antidepressanttreatments. KF-1 mediates E2-dependent ubiquitination and may modulate cellular proteinlevels as an E3 ubiquitin ligase; though its target proteins are not yet identified. To elucidatethe role of kf-1 in the central nervous system; we generated kf-1 knockout mice by genetargeting; using Cre-lox recombination. The resulting kf-1−/− mice were normal and healthyin appearance.

Differential effect of Fyn tyrosine kinase deletion on offensive and defensive aggression,Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Takeshi Yagi; Keizo Takao; Hiroaki Niki,Abstract Fyn tyrosine kinase is highly expressed in the limbic system and mice lacking Fyntyrosine kinase showed increased fearfulness in a variety of tests for anxiety-relatedbehaviors. To investigate the possible role of Fyn tyrosine kinase in aggression; weassessed the aggressive behaviors of the mice lacking the Fyn tyrosine kinase using theresident–intruder and restraint-induced target biting paradigms. The percentage of Fyn-deficient mice that attacked an inanimate target in a restraint tube was higher than that of thecontrol mice. On the contrary; in the resident–intruder paradigm; the percentage of Fyn-deficient mice that attacked the intruder was lower and the Fyn-deficient mice showed alonger latency to attack an intruder. These results suggest a distinct role of Fyn tyrosinekinase in enhancing the offensive aggression and decreasing the defensive aggression …,Behavioural brain research,2001,25
Altered sensitivities to morphine and cocaine in scaffold protein tamalin knockout mice,Masaaki Ogawa; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Kenji Nakamura; Jun Kitano; Kenryo Furushima; Hiroshi Kiyonari; Rika Nakayama; Kazuki Nakao; Koki Moriyoshi; Shigetada Nakanishi,Abstract Tamalin is a scaffold protein that interacts with metabotropic glutamate receptorsand the kinase-deficient neurotrophin TrkCT1 receptor and forms a protein complex withmultiple protein-trafficking and intracellular signaling molecules. In culture; tamalin promotesintracellular trafficking of group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors through its interactionwith guanine nucleotide exchange factor cytohesins and causes actin reorganization andmembrane ruffling via the TrkCT1/cytohesin-2 signaling mechanism. However; how tamalinserves its physiological function in vivo has remained elusive. In this study; we generatedtamalin knockout (Tam−/− KO) mice and investigated behavioral alterations resulting fromtheir deficiency in functional tamalin.

Synaptic E3 ligase SCRAPPER in contextual fear conditioning: extensive behavioral phenotyping of Scrapper heterozygote and overexpressing mutant mice,Ikuko Yao; Keizo Takao; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Seiji Ito; Mitsutoshi Setou,SCRAPPER; an F-box protein coded by FBXL20; is a subunit of SCF type E3 ubiquitinligase. SCRAPPER localizes synapses and directly binds to Rab3-interacting molecule 1(RIM1); an essential factor for synaptic vesicle release; thus it regulates neural transmissionvia RIM1 degradation. A defect in SCRAPPER leads to neurotransmission abnormalities;which could subsequently result in neurodegenerative phenotypes. Because it is likely thatthe alteration of neural transmission in Scrapper mutant mice affect their systemic condition;we have analyzed the behavioral phenotypes of mice with decreased or increased theamount of SCRAPPER. We carried out a series of behavioral test batteries for Scrappermutant mice. Scrapper transgenic mice overexpressing SCRAPPER in the hippocampus didnot show any significant difference in every test argued in this manuscript by comparison …,PLoS One,2011,23
Transcriptomic evidence for immaturity of the prefrontal cortex in patients with schizophrenia,Hideo Hagihara; Koji Ohira; Keizo Takao; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,Schizophrenia; a severe psychiatric disorder; has a lifetime prevalence of 1%. The exactmechanisms underlying this disorder remain unknown; though theories abound. Recentstudies suggest that particular cell types and biological processes in the schizophreniccortex have a pseudo-immature status in which the molecular properties partially resemblethose in the normal immature brain. However; genome-wide gene expression patterns in thebrains of patients with schizophrenia and those of normal infants have not been directlycompared. Here; we show that the gene expression patterns in the schizophrenic prefrontalcortex (PFC) resemble those in the juvenile PFC. We conducted a gene expression meta-analysis in which; using microarray data derived from different studies; altered expressionpatterns in the dorsolateral PFC (DLFC) of patients with schizophrenia were compared …,Molecular brain,2014,22
M 4 muscarinic receptor knockout mice display abnormal social behavior and decreased prepulse inhibition,Hisatsugu Koshimizu; Lorene M Leiter; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,In the central nervous system (CNS); the muscarinic system plays key roles in learning andmemory; as well as in the regulation of many sensory; motor; and autonomic processes; andis thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of several major diseases of the CNS; suchas Alzheimer's disease; depression; and schizophrenia. Previous studies reveal that M4muscarinic receptor knockout (M4R KO) mice displayed an increase in basal locomotoractivity; an increase in sensitivity to the prepulse inhibition (PPI)-disrupting effect ofpsychotomimetics; and normal basal PPI. However; other behaviorally significant roles ofM4R remain unclear. In this study; to further investigate precise functional roles of M4R inthe CNS; M4R KO mice were subjected to a battery of behavioral tests.

As a model for PD; we generated human α-syn bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice (BAC tg mice) harboring the entirehuman α-syn gene and its gene expression regulatory regions. The α-syn BAC tg micemanifested decreased anxiety-like behaviors which may reflect non-motor symptoms of earlyPD; and they exhibited increased SERT expression that may be responsible for decreasedanxiety-like behaviors. Our α-syn BAC tg mice could be a valuable tool to evaluate α-syngene dosage effects in vivo.,Neuroscience research,2012,19

Expression of the AMPA receptor subunits GluR1 and GluR2 is associated with granule cell maturation in the dentate gyrus,Hideo Hagihara; Koji Ohira; Keiko Toyama; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,The dentate gyrus produces new granule neurons throughout adulthood in mammals fromrodents to humans. During granule cell maturation; defined markers are expressed in ahighly regulated sequential process; which is necessary for directed neuronal differentiation.In the present study; we show that α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methy-4-isoxazole propionate(AMPA) receptor subunits GluR1 and GluR2 are expressed in differentiated granule cells;but not in stem cells; in neonatal and adult dentate gyrus. Using markers for neuralprogenitors; immature and mature granule cells; we found that GluR1 and GluR2 wereexpressed mainly in mature cells and in some immature cells. A time-course analysis of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine staining revealed that granule cells express GluR1 around 3 weeksafter being generated.

TRPV4 activation at the physiological temperature is a critical determinant of neuronal excitability and behavior,Koji Shibasaki; Shouta Sugio; Keizo Takao; Akihiro Yamanaka; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Makoto Tominaga; Yasuki Ishizaki,Abstract For homeothermic animals; constant body temperature is an important determinantof brain function. It is well established that changes in brain temperature dynamicallyinfluence hippocampal activity. We previously reported that the thermosensor TRPV4(activated above 34° C) is activated at the physiological temperature in hippocampalneurons and controls neuronal excitability in vitro. Here; we examined if TRPV4 regulatesneuronal excitability through its activation at the physiological temperature in vivo. We foundthat TRPV4-deficient (TRPV4KO) mice exhibit reduced depression-like and social behaviorscompared to wild-type (WT) mice; and the number of c-fos positive cells in the dentate gyruswas significantly reduced upon the depression-like behaviors. We measured restingmembrane potentials (RMPs) in the hippocampal granule cells from slice preparations at …,Pflügers Archiv-European Journal of Physiology,2015,17
Susceptibility to drug-induced seizures of Fyn tyrosine kinase-deficient mice.,Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Takeshi Yagi; Kyoko Tateishi; Hiroaki Niki,Abstract Mice deficient for the fyn gene were examined for their susceptibility to seizuresinduced by various convulsive drugs; including pentylenetetrazol; picrotoxin; bicuculline;kainic acid; N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and strychnine. Homozygous mutant (fynz/fynz)mice were significantly more likely to show myoclonic convulsions than were heterozygousmutants (+/fynz); when pentylenetetrazol; picrotoxin; bicuculline; kainic acid and NMDA wereadministered. On the other hand; no difference in seizure susceptibility was found betweenhomozygous and heterozygous mutants when strychnine was administered. These resultsprovide evidence of abnormal susceptibility to seizures induced by anti-GABAergic agentsand agonists for central excitatory amino acids in Fyn-deficient mice.,Neuroreport,1996,17
IRBIT regulates CaMKIIα activity and contributes to catecholamine homeostasis through tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylation,Katsuhiro Kawaai; Akihiro Mizutani; Hirotaka Shoji; Naoko Ogawa; Etsuko Ebisui; Yukiko Kuroda; Shigeharu Wakana; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Chihiro Hisatsune; Katsuhiko Mikoshiba,Abstract Inositol 1; 4; 5-trisphosphate receptor (IP 3 R) binding protein released with IP 3(IRBIT) contributes to various physiological events (electrolyte transport and fluid secretion;mRNA polyadenylation; and the maintenance of genomic integrity) through its interactionwith multiple targets. However; little is known about the physiological role of IRBIT in thebrain. Here we identified calcium calmodulin-dependent kinase II alpha (CaMKIIα) as anIRBIT-interacting molecule in the central nervous system. IRBIT binds to and suppressesCaMKIIα kinase activity by inhibiting the binding of calmodulin to CaMKIIα. In addition; weshow that mice lacking IRBIT present with elevated catecholamine levels; increasedlocomotor activity; and social abnormalities. The level of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)phosphorylation by CaMKIIα; which affects TH activity; was significantly increased in the …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2015,16

Chronic overload of SEPT4; a parkin substrate that aggregates in Parkinson’s disease; causes behavioral alterations but not neurodegeneration in mice,Natsumi Ageta-Ishihara; Hodaka Yamakado; Takao Morita; Satoko Hattori; Keizo Takao; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Ryosuke Takahashi; Makoto Kinoshita,In autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinsonism (PARK2); the pathogenetic process fromthe loss of function of a ubiquitin ligase parkin to the death of dopamine neurons remainsunclear. A dominant hypothesis attributes the neurotoxicity to accumulated substrates thatare exempt from parkin-mediated degradation. Parkin substrates include two septins;SEPT4/CDCrel-2 which coaggregates with α-synuclein as Lewy bodies in Parkinson'sdisease; and its closest homolog SEPT5/CDCrel-1/PNUTL1 whose overload with viral vectorcan rapidly eliminate dopamine neurons in rats. However; chronic effects of pan-neuraloverload of septins have never been examined in mammals.

Comprehensive Behavioral Analysis of Male Ox1r−/− Mice Showed Implication of Orexin Receptor-1 in Mood; Anxiety; and Social Behavior,Md G Abbas; Hirotaka Shoji; Shingo Soya; Mari Hondo; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Takeshi Sakurai,Neuropeptides orexin A and orexin B; which are exclusively produced by neurons in thelateral hypothalamic area; play an important role in the regulation of a wide range ofbehaviors and homeostatic processes; including regulation of sleep/wakefulness states andenergy homeostasis. The orexin system has close anatomical and functional relationshipswith systems that regulate the autonomic nervous system; emotion; mood; the reward systemand sleep/wakefulness states. Recent pharmacological studies using selective antagonistshave suggested that orexin receptor-1 (OX1R) is involved in physiological processes thatregulate emotion; the reward system and autonomic nervous system.

Comprehensive behavioral analysis of voltage-gated calcium channel beta-anchoring and-regulatory protein knockout mice,Akito Nakao; Takafumi Miki; Hirotaka Shoji; Miyuki Nishi; Hiroshi Takeshima; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Yasuo Mori,Calcium (Ca2+) influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) induces numerousintracellular events such as neuronal excitability; neurotransmitter release; synapticplasticity; and gene regulation. It has been shown that genes related to Ca2+ signaling; suchas the CACNA1C; CACNB2; and CACNA1I genes that encode VGCC subunits; areassociated with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. Recently; VGCC beta-anchoring and-regulatory protein (BARP) was identified as a novel regulator of VGCCactivity via the interaction of VGCC β subunits. To examine the role of the BARP in higherbrain functions; we generated BARP knockout (KO) mice and conducted a comprehensivebattery of behavioral tests.

Reply to Warren et al. and Shay et al.: Commonalities across species do exist and are potentially important,Keizo Takao; Hideo Hagihara; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,In comparisons of human burn conditions and mouse models of infection; we found that1;608 genes; roughly 12% of the genes that changed in humans; changed in the samedirection in mice; as indicated by Warren et al.(1). However; we argue that this fact does notindicate that mice are a poor animal model for the following reasons. First; at present; we donot understand 12% of the entire picture of a complex biological phenomenon such asinflammation; do we? If not; the shared changes of 1;608 genes may not be negligible andwould be useful for understanding the mechanisms shared by humans and mice.

KF-1 ubiquitin ligase: an anxiety suppressor,Tamotsu Hashimoto-Gotoh; Naoyuki Iwabe; Atsushi Tsujimura; Keizo Takao; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,Anxiety is an instinct that may have developed to promote adaptive survival by evadingunnecessary danger. However; excessive anxiety is disruptive and can be a basic disorderof other psychiatric diseases such as depression. The KF-1; a ubiquitin ligase located to theendoplasmic reticulum (ER); may prevent excessive anxiety; kf-1−/− mice exhibit selectivelyelevated anxiety-like behavior against light or heights. Thus; KF-1 may degrade some targetproteins; responsible for promoting anxiety; through the ER-associated degradationpathway; similar to Parkin in Parkinson's disease (PD). Parkin; another ER-ubiquitin ligase;prevents the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons by degrading the target proteinsresponsible for PD. Molecular phylogenetic studies have revealed that the prototype of kf-1appeared in the very early phase of animal evolution but was lost; unlike parkin; in the …,Frontiers in neuroscience,2009,9
Mice that lack the C-terminal region of Reelin exhibit behavioral abnormalities related to neuropsychiatric disorders,Kaori Sakai; Hirotaka Shoji; Takao Kohno; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Mitsuharu Hattori,Abstract The secreted glycoprotein Reelin is believed to play critical roles in thepathogenesis of several neuropsychiatric disorders. The highly basic C-terminal region(CTR) of Reelin is necessary for efficient activation of its downstream signaling; and thebrain structure of knock-in mice that lack the CTR (ΔC-KI mice) is impaired. Here; weperformed a comprehensive behavioral test battery on ΔC-KI mice; in order to evaluate theeffects of partial loss-of-function of Reelin on brain functions. The ΔC-KI mice werehyperactive and exhibited reduced anxiety-like and social behaviors. The working memoryin ΔC-KI mice was impaired in a T-maze test. There was little difference in spatial referencememory; depression-like behavior; prepulse inhibition; or fear memory between ΔC-KI andwild-type mice. These results suggest that CTR-dependent Reelin functions are required …,Scientific reports,2016,8
Gomafu lncRNA knockout mice exhibit mild hyperactivity with enhanced responsiveness to the psychostimulant methamphetamine,Joanna Y Ip; Masamitsu Sone; Chieko Nashiki; Qun Pan; Kiyoyuki Kitaichi; Kaori Yanaka; Takaya Abe; Keizo Takao; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Benjamin J Blencowe; Shinichi Nakagawa,Abstract The long noncoding RNA Gomafu/MIAT/Rncr2 is thought to function in retinal cellspecification; stem cell differentiation and the control of alternative splicing. To furtherinvestigate physiological functions of Gomafu; we created mouse knockout (KO) model thatcompletely lacks the Gomafu gene. The KO mice did not exhibit any developmental deficits.However; behavioral tests revealed that the KO mice are hyperactive. This hyperactivebehavior was enhanced when the KO mice were treated with the psychostimulantmethamphetamine; which was associated with an increase in dopamine release in thenucleus accumbens. RNA sequencing analyses identified a small number of genes affectedby the deficiency of Gomafu; a subset of which are known to have important neurobiologicalfunctions. These observations suggest that Gomafu modifies mouse behavior thorough a …,Scientific reports,2016,8

However; it has not been clear if the deficiency in Reelin-Dab1signaling is responsible for symptoms of the disorders. Here; to examine the function ofReelin-Dab1 signaling in the forebrain; we generated dorsal forebrain-specific Dab1conditional knockout mouse (Dab1 cKO) and performed a behavioral test battery on theDab1 cKO mice. Although conventional Dab1 null mutant mice exhibit cerebellar atrophyand cerebellar ataxia; the Dab1 cKO mice had normal cerebellum and showed no motordysfunction.

However; the in vivo role of theMg2+ block in the mammalian brain has not yet been investigated; because brain-wide lossof the Mg2+ block causes perinatal lethality. In this study; we used a brain-region specificknock-in mouse expressing an NMDA receptor that is defective for the Mg2+ block in orderto test its role in neural information processing. We devised a method to induce a singleamino acid substitution (N595Q) in the GluN2A subunit of the NMDA receptor; specifically inthe hippocampal dentate gyrus in mice. This mutation reduced the Mg2+ block at the medialperforant path–granule cell synapse and facilitated synaptic potentiation induced by high-frequency stimulation. The mutants had more stable hippocampal place fields in the CA1 …,Molecular brain,2014,8

Circadian gene circuitry predicts hyperactive behavior in a mood disorder mouse model,Hideo Hagihara; Tomoyasu Horikawa; Hironori K Nakamura; Juzoh Umemori; Hirotaka Shoji; Yukiyasu Kamitani; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,Summary Bipolar disorder; also known as manic-depressive illness; causes swings in moodand activity levels at irregular intervals. Such changes are difficult to predict; and theirmolecular basis remains unknown. Here; we use infradian (longer than a day) cyclic activitylevels in αCaMKII (Camk2a) mutant mice as a proxy for such mood-associated changes. Wereport that gene-expression patterns in the hippocampal dentate gyrus could retrospectivelypredict whether the mice were in a state of high or low locomotor activity (LA). Expression ofa subset of circadian genes; as well as levels of cAMP and pCREB; possible upstreamregulators of circadian genes; were correlated with LA states; suggesting that the intrinsicmolecular circuitry changes concomitant with infradian oscillatory LA.

Forebrain-specific constitutively active CaMKKα transgenic mice show deficits in hippocampus-dependent long-term memory,Taku Kaitsuka; Sheng-Tian Li; Kenji Nakamura; Keizo Takao; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Masayuki Matsushita,Abstract The Ca 2+/calmodulin (CaM) kinase cascade is activated by Ca 2+ influx throughthe voltage-dependent Ca 2+ channels and the NMDA receptor. CaM kinase kinase(CaMKK); the most upstream kinase of the CaM kinase cascade; phosphorylates andactivates both CaM kinase I (CaMKI) and CaMKIV; resulting in activation of cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB)-dependent gene transcription. Using transgenictechniques; we created mutant mice in which a constitutively active form of CaMKK1; theautoinhibitory domain truncated protein; is over-expressed specifically in the forebrain. Inthese mice; although performance was normal in basal activity and short-term memory;specific impairments were shown in hippocampus-dependent long-term memory aftertraining in spatial memory tasks and after contextual fear conditioning.

Decreased cohesin in the brain leads to defective synapse development and anxiety-related behavior,Yuki Fujita; Koji Masuda; Masashige Bando; Ryuichiro Nakato; Yuki Katou; Takashi Tanaka; Masahiro Nakayama; Keizo Takao; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Tatsunori Tanaka; Yukio Ago; Hitoshi Hashimoto; Katsuhiko Shirahige; Toshihide Yamashita,Abnormal epigenetic regulation can cause the nervous system to develop abnormally. Here;we sought to understand the mechanism by which this occurs by investigating the proteincomplex cohesin; which is considered to regulate gene expression and; when defective; isassociated with higher-level brain dysfunction and the developmental disorder Cornelia deLange syndrome (CdLS). We generated conditional Smc3-knockout mice and observedgreater dendritic complexity and larger numbers of immature synapses in the cerebral cortexof Smc3+/− mice. Smc3+/− mice also exhibited more anxiety-related behavior; which is asymptom of CdLS. Further; a gene ontology analysis after RNA-sequencing suggested theenrichment of immune processes; particularly the response to interferons; in the Smc3+/−mice. Indeed; fewer synapses formed in their cortical neurons; and this phenotype was …,Journal of Experimental Medicine,2017,5
Prothymosin alpha‐deficiency enhances anxiety‐like behaviors and impairs learning/memory functions and neurogenesis,Hiroshi Ueda; Keita Sasaki; Sebok Kumar Halder; Yuichi Deguchi; Keizo Takao; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Atsushi Tajima,Abstract Prothymosin alpha (ProTα) is expressed in various mammalian organs includingthe neuronal nuclei in the brain; and is involved in multiple functions; such as chromatinremodeling; transcriptional regulation; cell proliferation; and survival. ProTα has beneficialactions against ischemia-induced necrosis and apoptosis in the brain and retina. However;characterizing the physiological roles of endogenous ProTα in the brain without stressremains elusive. Here; we generated ProTα-deficiency mice to explore whether endogenousProTα is involved in normal brain functions. We successfully generated heterozygous ProTαknockout (ProTα+/−) mice; while all homozygous ProTα knockout (ProTα−/−) offspring diedat early embryonic stage; suggesting that ProTα has crucial roles in embryonic development.In the evaluation of different behavioral tests; ProTα+/− mice exhibited hypolocomotor …,Journal of neurochemistry,2017,5
Disruption of the Sjögren-Larsson syndrome gene Aldh3a2 in mice increases keratinocyte growth and retards skin barrier recovery,Tatsuro Naganuma; Shuyu Takagi; Tsukasa Kanetake; Takuya Kitamura; Satoko Hattori; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Takayuki Sassa; Akio Kihara,Abstract The fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) ALDH3A2 is the causative gene ofSjögren Larsson syndrome (SLS). To date; the molecular mechanism underlying thesymptoms characterizing SLS has been poorly understood. Using Aldh3a2−/− mice; wefound here that Aldh3a2 was the major FALDH active in undifferentiated keratinocytes. Long-chain base metabolism was greatly impaired in Aldh3a2−/− keratinocytes. Phenotypically;the intercellular spaces were widened in the basal layer of the Aldh3a2−/− epidermis due tohyperproliferation of keratinocytes. Furthermore; oxidative stress-induced genes were up-regulated in Aldh3a2−/− keratinocytes. Upon keratinocyte differentiation; the activity ofanother FALDH; Aldh3b2; surpassed that of Aldh3a2. As a result; Aldh3a2−/− mice wereindistinguishable from wild-type mice in terms of their whole epidermis FALDH activity …,Journal of Biological Chemistry,2016,5
Comprehensive behavioral analysis of RNG105 (Caprin1) heterozygous mice: Reduced social interaction and attenuated response to novelty,Rie Ohashi; Keizo Takao; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Nobuyuki Shiina,Abstract RNG105 (also known as Caprin1) is a major RNA-binding protein in neuronal RNAgranules; and is responsible for mRNA transport to dendrites and neuronal networkformation. A recent study reported that a heterozygous mutation in the Rng105 gene wasfound in an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patient; but it remains unclear whether there is acausal relation between RNG105 deficiency and ASD. Here; we subjected Rng105+/− miceto a comprehensive behavioral test battery; and revealed the influence of RNG105deficiency on mouse behavior. Rng105+/− mice exhibited a reduced sociality in a homecage and a weak preference for social novelty. Consistently; the Rng105+/− mice alsoshowed a weak preference for novel objects and novel place patterns. Furthermore;although the Rng105+/− mice exhibited normal memory acquisition; they tended to have …,Scientific reports,2016,5
Behavioral abnormalities observed in Zfhx2-deficient mice,Yuriko Komine; Keizo Takao; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Tetsuo Yamamori,Zfhx2 (also known as zfh-5) encodes a transcription factor containing three homeoboxdomains and 18 Zn-finger motifs. We have reported that Zfhx2 mRNA is expressed mainly indifferentiating neurons in the mouse brain and its expression level is negatively regulated bythe antisense transcripts of Zfhx2. Although the expression profile of Zfhx2 suggests thatZFHX2 might have a role in a particular step of neuronal differentiation; the specific functionof the gene has not been determined. We generated a Zfhx2-deficient mouse line andperformed a comprehensive battery of behavioral tests to elucidate the function of ZFHX2.Homozygous Zfhx2-deficient mice showed several behavioral abnormalities; namely;hyperactivity; enhanced depression-like behaviors; and an aberrantly altered anxiety-likephenotype. These behavioral phenotypes suggest that ZFHX2 might play roles in …,PloS one,2012,5
Comprehensive behavioral phenotyping of a new Semaphorin 3 F mutant mouse,Ikuo Matsuda; Hirotaka Shoji; Nobuyuki Yamasaki; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Atsu Aiba,Semaphorin 3 F (Sema3F) is a secreted type of the Semaphorin family of axon guidancemolecules. Sema3F and its receptor neuropilin-2 (Npn-2) are expressed in a mutuallyexclusive manner in the embryonic mouse brain regions including olfactory bulb;hippocampus; and cerebral cortex. Sema3F is thought to have physiological functions in theformation of neuronal circuitry and its refinement. However; functional roles of Sema3F in thebrain remain to be clarified. Here; we examined behavioral effects of Sema3F deficiencythrough a comprehensive behavioral test battery in Sema3F knockout (KO) male mice tounderstand the possible functions of Sema3F in the brain. Male Sema3F KO and wild-type(WT) control mice were subjected to a battery of behavioral tests; including neurologicalscreen; rotarod; hot plate; prepulse inhibition; light/dark transition; open field; elevated …,Molecular brain,2016,4

Here we show that; in the cerebellum; CDC42EP4 isexclusively expressed in Bergmann glia and localizes beneath specific membrane domainsenwrapping dendritic spines of Purkinje cells. CDC42EP4 forms complexes with septinhetero-oligomers; which interact with a subset of glutamate transporter GLAST/EAAT1. InCdc42ep4−/− mice; GLAST is dissociated from septins and is delocalized away from theparallel fibre-Purkinje cell synapses.

The importance of metrics for evaluating scientific performance,Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,Abstract Evaluation of scientific performance is a major factor that determines the behavior ofboth individual researchers and the academic institutes to which they belong. Because thenumber of researchers heavily outweighs the number of available research posts; and thecompetitive funding accounts for an ever-increasing proportion of research budget; someobjective indicators of research performance have gained recognition for increasingtransparency and openness. It is common practice to use metrics and indices to evaluate aresearcher's performance or the quality of their grant applications. Such measures includethe number of publications; the number of times these papers are cited and; more recently;the h-index; which measures the number of highly-cited papers the researcher has written.However; academic institutions and funding agencies in Japan have been rather slow to …,Journal of Information Processing and Management,2012,4
Transcriptomic immaturity of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in patients with alcoholism,Tomoyuki Murano; Hisatsugu Koshimizu; Hideo Hagihara; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,Abstract Alcoholism; which is defined as the recurring harmful use of alcohol despite itsnegative consequences; has a lifetime prevalence of 17.8%. Previous studies have shownthat chronic alcohol consumption disrupts various brain functions and behaviours. However;the precise mechanisms that underlie alcoholism are currently unclear. Recently; wediscovered “pseudo-immature” brain cell states of the dentate gyrus and prefrontal cortex(PFC) in mouse models of psychotic disorders and epileptic seizure. Similar pseudo-immaturity has been observed in patients with psychotic disorders; such as schizophreniaand bipolar disorder. Patients with alcoholism occasionally exhibit similar psychologicalsymptoms; implying shared molecular and cellular mechanisms between these diseases.Here; we performed a meta-analysis to compare microarray data from the hippocampi …,Scientific reports,2017,3
Cohort removal induces changes in body temperature; pain sensitivity; and anxiety-like behavior,Keizo Takao; Hirotaka Shoji; Satoko Hattori; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,Mouse behavior is analyzed to elucidate the effects of various experimental manipulations;including gene mutation and drug administration. When the effect of a factor of interest isassessed; other factors; such as age; sex; temperature; apparatus; and housing; arecontrolled in experiments by matching; counterbalancing; and/or randomizing. One suchfactor that has not attracted much attention is the effect of sequential removal of animals froma common cage (cohort removal). Here we evaluated the effects of cohort removal on rectaltemperature; pain sensitivity; and anxiety-like behavior by analyzing the combined data of alarge number of C57BL/6J mice that we collected using a comprehensive behavioral testbattery. Rectal temperature increased in a stepwise manner according to the position ofsequential removal from the cage; consistent with previous reports.

DIP/WISH deficiency enhances synaptic function and performance in the Barnes maze,Suhail Asrar; Keiko Kaneko; Keizo Takao; Jaina Negandhi; Makoto Matsui; Koji Shibasaki; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Robert V Harrison; Zhengping Jia; Michael W Salter; Makoto Tominaga; Tomoko Fukumi-Tominaga,DIP (diaphanous interacting protein)/WISH (WASP interacting SH3 protein) is a proteininvolved in cytoskeletal signaling which regulates actin cytoskeleton dynamics and/ormicrotubules mainly through the activity of Rho-related proteins. Although it is wellestablished that: 1) spine-head volumes change dynamically and reflect the strength of thesynapse accompanying long-term functional plasticity of glutamatergic synaptic transmissionand 2) actin organization is critically involved in spine formation; the involvement ofDIP/WISH in these processes is unknown. We found that DIP/WISH-deficient hippocampalCA1 neurons exhibit enhanced long-term potentiation via modulation of both pre-and post-synaptic events. Consistent with these electrophysiological findings; DIP/WISH-deficientmice; particularly at a relatively young age; found the escape hole more rapidly in the …,Molecular brain,2011,3

Promoting neuroregeneration after perinatal arterial ischemic stroke: neurotrophic factors and mesenchymal stem cells,Nienke Wagenaar; Caroline GM de Theije; Linda S de Vries; Floris Groenendaal; Manon JNL Benders; Cora HA Nijboer,Abstract Newborns suffering from perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (PAIS) are at risk ofneurodevelopmental problems. Current treatment options for PAIS are limited and mainlyfocus on supportive care; as presentation of PAIS is beyond the time window of currenttreatment strategies. Therefore; recent focus has shifted to interventions that stimulateregeneration of damaged brain tissue. From animal models; it is known that the brainincreases its neurogenic capability after ischemic injury; by promoting neural cellproliferation and differentiation. However; neurogenesis is not maintained at the long term;which consequently impedes full repair leading to adverse consequences later in life.Boosting neuroregeneration of the newborn brain using treatment with neurotrophic factorsand/or mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may be promising novel therapeutic strategies to …,*,2017,2
Loss of X-linked Protocadherin-19 differentially affects the behavior of heterozygous female and hemizygous male mice,Shuichi Hayashi; Yoko Inoue; Satoko Hattori; Mari Kaneko; Go Shioi; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Masatoshi Takeichi,Abstract Mutations in the X-linked gene Protocadherin-19 (Pcdh19) cause female-limitedepilepsy and mental retardation in humans. Although Pcdh19 is known to be a homophiliccell-cell adhesion molecule; how its mutations bring about female-specific disorders remainselusive. Here; we report the effects of Pcdh19 knockout in mice on their development andbehavior. Pcdh19 was expressed in various brain regions including the cerebral cortex andhippocampus. Although Pcdh19-positive cells were evenly distributed in layer V of wild-typecortices; their distribution became a mosaic in Pcdh19 heterozygous female cortices. Incortical and hippocampal neurons; Pcdh19 was localized along their dendrites; showingoccasional accumulation on synapses. Pcdh19 mutants; however; displayed no detectableabnormalities in dendrite and spine morphology of layer V neurons. Nevertheless …,Scientific Reports,2017,2

Despite theoccurrence of affective and emotional impairments in patients with Down syndrome; theseparameters are poorly documented in Down syndrome mouse models; including Ts1Cjemice. Here; we conducted comprehensive behavioral analyses; including anxiety-;sociability-; and depression-related tasks; and biochemical analyses of monoamines andtheir metabolites in Ts1Cje mice. Ts1Cje mice showed enhanced locomotor activity in novelenvironments and increased social contact with unfamiliar partners when compared withwild-type littermates; but a significantly lower activity in familiar environments.

QRFP-deficient mice are hypophagic; lean; hypoactive and exhibit increased anxiety-like behavior,Kitaro Okamoto; Miwako Yamasaki; Keizo Takao; Shingo Soya; Monica Iwasaki; Koh Sasaki; Kenta Magoori; Iori Sakakibara; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Michihiro Mieda; Masahiko Watanabe; Juro Sakai; Masashi Yanagisawa; Takeshi Sakurai,How the hypothalamus transmits hunger information to other brain regions to govern wholebrain function to orchestrate feeding behavior has remained largely unknown. Our presentstudy suggests the importance of a recently found lateral hypothalamic neuropeptide; QRFP;in this signaling. Qrfp-/-mice were hypophagic and lean; and exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior; and were hypoactive in novel circumstances as compared with wild typelittermates. They also showed decreased wakefulness time in the early hours of the darkperiod. Histological studies suggested that QRFP neurons receive rich innervations fromneurons in the arcuate nucleus which is a primary region for sensing the body's metabolicstate by detecting levels of leptin; ghrelin and glucose. These observations suggest thatQRFP is an important mediator that acts as a downstream mediator of the arcuate nucleus …,PloS one,2016,2
Immaturity of brain as an endophenotype of neuropsychiatric disorders,Hideo Hagihara; Hirotaka Shoji; Keizo Takao; Noah M Walton; Mitsuyuki Matsumoto; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,Abstract Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are severe neuropsychiatric disorders; affectingabout 1% of the population. Identifying endophenotypes in the brains of neuropsychiatricpatients is now considered the way to understand the underlying mechanisms and toimprove therapeutic outcomes. However; the endophenotypes and brain mechanisms of thedisorders remain unknown. We have previously reported that alpha-CaMKII heterozygousknockout mice show abnormal behaviors related to neuropsychiatric disorders. In thesemutant mice; almost all neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus stay at a pseudo-immature state; which we refer to as" immature dentate gyrus (iDG)." So far; the iDGphenotype and similar behavioral abnormalities have been found in Schnurri-2 knockout;SNAP-25 mutant; and forebrain-specific calcineurin knockout mice. In addition; we found …,*,2014,2
Investigating genes-to-behavior pathways in psychiatric diseases: an approach using a comprehensive behavioral test battery on genetically engineered mice,K Takao; T Miyakawa,Abstract We have been investigating the relationships between genes and behaviors byconducting a systematic and well-defined behavioral test battery with mice that have amutation on a gene of interest. The behavioral test battery covers a relatively broad range ofvarious behavioral domains such as learning and memory; sensory-motor functions;emotion; motivation; and drug sensitivity/preference. Recently; we subjected mice lackingcalcineurin (CN); a calcium/calmodulin protein phosphatase; to the comprehensivebehavioral test battery. The mutant mice had a severe working memory deficit; increasedlocomotor activity; decreased social interaction; and impairments in prepulse and latentinhibition. The abnormalities of CN mutant mice were strikingly similar to those described forschizophrenic patients. Consistent with these findings; human genetics studies in a large …,*,2008,2

Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor Knockout Mice,J Wess; W Zhang; A Duttaroy; T Miyakawa; J Gomeza; Y Cui; AS Basile; FP Bymaster; DL McKinzie; CC Felder; C Deng; M Yamada,Abstract Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) play critical roles in regulating theactivity of many important functions of the central and peripheral nervous system. However;identification of the physiological and pathophysiological roles of the individual mAChRsubtypes (M 1-M 5) has proven a difficult task; primarily due to the lack of ligands endowedwith a high degree of receptor subtype selectivity and the fact that most tissues and organsexpress multiple mAChRs. To circumvent these difficulties; we and others have used genetargeting strategies to generate mutant mouse lines containing inactivating mutations of theM 1-M 5 mAChR genes. The different mAChR mutant mice and the corresponding wild-typecontrol animals were subjected to a battery of physiological; pharmacological; behavioral;biochemical; and neurochemical tests.

Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor knockout mice: phenotypical analysis and clinical implications,J Gomeza; M Yamada; A Duttaroy; W Zhang; R Makita; T Miyakawa; J Crawley; L Zhang; H Shannon; FP Bymaster; CC Felder; C Deng; J Wess,Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the phenotypical analysis and clinicalimplications of muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor knockout mice. Molecular cloningstudies have revealed the existence of five molecularly distinct muscarinic acetylcholine(ACh) receptor (mAChR) subtypes (M 1–M 5). At a molecular level; the M 1; M 3; and M 5receptors preferentially couple to G proteins of the G q/G 11 family; whereas the M 2 and M 4receptors are primarily linked to G proteins of the G i/G o class. Studies with mAChRagonists and antagonists have shown that mAChRs are involved in the control of numerousfundamental physiological processes. Central mAChRs are known to regulate a largenumber of vegetative; sensory; and motor functions.

Abnormalities in perineuronal nets and behavior in mice lacking CSGalNAcT1; a key enzyme in chondroitin sulfate synthesis,Nozomu Yoshioka; Shinji Miyata; Atsushi Tamada; Yumi Watanabe; Asami Kawasaki; Hiroshi Kitagawa; Keizo Takao; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Kosei Takeuchi; Michihiro Igarashi,Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is an important glycosaminoglycan and is mainly found in theextracellular matrix as CS proteoglycans. In the brain; CS proteoglycans are highlyconcentrated in perineuronal nets (PNNs); which surround synapses and modulate theirfunctions. To investigate the importance of CS; we produced and precisely examined micethat were deficient in the CS synthesizing enzyme; CSGalNAcT1 (T1KO). Biochemicalanalysis of T1KO revealed that loss of this enzyme reduced the amount of CS byapproximately 50% in various brain regions. The amount of CS in PNNs was alsodiminished in T1KO compared to wild-type mice; although the amount of a major CSproteoglycan core protein; aggrecan; was not changed.

While thismutation accelerates amyloid β (Aβ) oligomerization; only patient homozygotes suffer fromdementia; implying that this mutation is recessive and causes loss-of-function of amyloidprecursor protein (APP). To investigate the recessive trait; we generated a new mousemodel by knocking-in the Osaka mutation into endogenous mouse APP. The producedhomozygous; heterozygous; and non-knockin littermates were compared for memory;neuropathology; and synaptic plasticity. Homozygotes showed memory impairment at 4months; whereas heterozygotes did not; even at 8 months. Immunohistochemical andbiochemical analyses revealed that only homozygotes displayed intraneuronalaccumulation of Aβ oligomers at 8 months; followed by abnormal tau phosphorylation …,Acta neuropathologica communications,2017,*

Comprehensive Behavioral Analysis of Activating Transcription Factor 5-Deficient Mice,Mariko Umemura; Tae Ogura; Ayako Matsuzaki; Haruo Nakano; Keizo Takao; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Yuji Takahashi,Activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) is a member of the CREB/ATF family of basic leucinezipper transcription factors. We previously reported that ATF5-deficient (ATF5-/-) micedemonstrated abnormal olfactory bulb development due to impaired interneuron supply.Furthermore; ATF5-/-mice were less aggressive than ATF5+/+ mice. Although ATF5 is widelyexpressed in the brain; and involved in the regulation of proliferation and development ofneurons; the physiological role of ATF5 in the higher brain remains unknown. Our objectivewas to investigate the physiological role of ATF5 in the higher brain. We performed acomprehensive behavioral analysis using ATF5-/-mice and wild type littermates. ATF5-/-mice exhibited abnormal locomotor activity in the open field test. They also exhibitedabnormal anxiety-like behavior in the light/dark transition test and open field test …,Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2017,*

Neurogranin is a neuron-specificcalmodulin binding protein abundantly expressed in brain regions implicated inschizophrenia pathophysiology; such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Nrgnknockout (KO) mice were previously shown to exhibit aberrant behavioral phenotypesinvolving deficits in cognitive functions and abnormal emotional behaviors. In this study; weexamined additional behavioral and molecular traits relevant to schizophrenia in Nrgn KOmice.

PS131. Transcriptomic evidence for dematuration of the mouse frontal cortex and hippocampus by chronic antidepressant treatment,Hideo Hagihara; Koji Ohira; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,Abstract The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; fluoxetine (FLX); is widely used to treatdepression and anxiety disorders; but mechanisms underlying its antidepressant effectremain largely unknown. Previous studies that evaluated several molecular and/orelectrophysiological features of the maturation stages of each neuron type havedemonstrated that FLX treatment can reverse the established maturation of certain types ofneurons in the hippocampus and frontal cortex (FC). However; this dematuration effect ofFLX in the adult brain has not been assessed with regard to genome-wide gene expressionpatterns.,International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology,2016,*

Consequently; the putative NMDAR dysregulation in thepathophysiology of schizophrenia and mood disorders could be due to disturbed D-serinesignaling. Some studies described the changed D-serine levels in serum; plasma andcerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with schizophrenia and major depressive disorder(MDD). Furthermore; G72 gene that encodes an activator protein of D-amino acid oxidase(DAAO); a D-serine degrading enzyme; has been reported to associate with schizophreniaand bipolar disorders.

Interpretation of the data; however; is controversial as to whether thisfinding reflects a primary feature of the diseases or is a result of confounding factors such asmedication; postmortem interval; and agonal state. To date; systematic investigation of brainpH has not been undertaken using animal models; which can be studied without confoundsinherent in human studies. In the present study; we first confirmed that the brains of patientswith schizophrenia and bipolar disorder exhibit lower pH values by conducting a meta-analysis of existing datasets. We then utilized neurodevelopmental mouse models ofpsychiatric disorders in order to test the hypothesis that lower brain pH exists in these brainscompared to controls due to the underlying pathophysiology of the disorders.

Alpha-CaMKII deficiency causes dysregulated behaviors and immature dentate gyrus,Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,抄録 The identification of endophenotypes is an essential step for investigating psychiatricillness; but represents a considerable challenge in human patients. Here we show thatalpha-CaMKII heterozygous knockout mice have dysregulated behaviors; including a severeworking memory deficit and an exaggerated infradian rhythm. The neurons of the dentategyrus (DG) in the mutants resembled immature DG neurons in normal rodents. Biomarkersderived from the mutants classified individuals into two clusters; one of which had highersusceptibility to schizophrenia and differential expression of genes related to neuraldevelopment. Based on these results; we propose the" immature DG" as a candidateendophenotype of psychiatric disorders.[J Physiol Sci. 2008; 58 Suppl: S15],Proceedings of Annual Meeting of the Physiological Society of Japan Proceedings of Annual Meeting of the Physiological Society of Japan,2008,*
Elevated Plus Maze for Mice. JoVE. 22,M Komada; K Takao; T Miyakawa,Abstract Although the mouse genome is now completely sequenced; the functions of most ofthe genes expressed in the brain are not known. The influence of a given gene on a specificbehavior can be determined by behavioral analysis of mutant mice. If a target gene isexpressed in the brain; behavioral phenotype of the mutant mice could elucidate the geneticmechanism of normal behaviors. The elevated plus maze test is one of the most widely usedtests for measuring anxiety-like behavior. The test is based on the natural aversion of micefor open and elevated areas; as well as on their natural spontaneous exploratory behavior innovel environments. The apparatus consists of open arms and closed arms; crossed in themiddle perpendicularly to each other; and a center area. Mice are given access to all of thearms and are allowed to move freely between them. The number of entries into the open …,*,2008,*

Comprehensive behavioral test battery for genetically engineered mice: A proposal to use it as a" hub" for large-scale neuroscience,Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,抄録 Identification of the functions of the genes at system level is one of the greatestchallenges in the post genome-sequence era. To reveal functional significance of the genesexpressed in the brain; we have been utilizing a comprehensive behavioral test battery onvarious kinds of genetically-engineered mice. The behavioral test battery covers a broadrange of various behavioral domains; such as learning and memory; sensory-motorfunctions; emotions and motivation. During the past two years; we have assessed behaviorsof more than 30 different strains of mutant mice and; surprisingly; we found at least onesignificant behavioral abnormality in more than 90% of those strains.

Light/dark Transition Test for Mice. JoVE. 1,K Takao; T Miyakawa,Abstract Although all of the mouse genome sequences have been determined; we do not yetknow the functions of most of these genes. Gene-targeting techniques; however; can beused to delete or manipulate a specific gene in mice. The influence of a given gene on aspecific behavior can then be determined by conducting behavioral analyses of the mutantmice. As a test for behavioral phenotyping of mutant mice; the light/dark transition test is oneof the most widely used tests to measure anxiety-like behavior in mice. The test is based onthe natural aversion of mice to brightly illuminated areas and on their spontaneousexploratory behavior in novel environments. The test is sensitive to anxiolytic drug treatment.The apparatus consists of a dark chamber and a brightly illuminated chamber. Mice areallowed to move freely between the two chambers.

However; in the past; such studies have been hamperedby the complex; overlapping expression pattern of the M;-M5 receptors2'3 and the lack ofligands endowed with a high degree of receptor subtype selectivity. 4 To overcome thesedifficulties; we recently generated mutant mouse strains deficient in each of the fivemuscarinic receptor subtypes. 5" 10 In an initial set of studies; these mutant animals wereinvestigated by using a number of different experimental approaches. 5" 10 Studies with M2and M4 receptor mutant mice showed that the lack of these two receptor subtypes was …,Cholinergic Mechanisms,2004,*
C-fos expression and accelerated visual cued fear conditioning in mice with visual input directed to the auditory thalamus,Jessica R Newton; Charlene Ellsworth; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Susumu Tonegawa; Mriganka Sur,Abstract Neonatal surgery induces retinal axons to innervate the medial geniculate nucleus(MGN) of the thalamus; providing visual input to cells in auditory thalamus and cortex.However; the behavioral consequences of this “rewiring” are largely unknown. In normalmice; a few tone-shock pairings are sufficient to elicit fear to the tone presented alone;whereas a visual cue is less effective: many more light-shock pairings are needed to elicitfear to the light alone. The present study explores whether visual inputs routed to the MGNinfluence fear conditioning behavior. Bilateral ablation of the inferior colliculus in p0 miceinduced retinal innervation of the MGN. As adults; the mice underwent 3 sessions of fearconditioning and behavioral testing. A conditioning session consisted of 10 minutes ofhabituation followed by 3 cue-shock pairings (30 sec ISI).

Central-and periph in vitro quantitative autoradiographic studies of the eral-type benzodiazepine receptors in Fyn-deficient mice,Yurie Nakamoto; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Takeshi Yagi; Hiroaki Niki; Mitsunobu Yoshii,АННОТАЦИЯ: Fyn tyrosine kinase deficient mice progress audiogenic seizure susceptibilityand fearfulness (Miyakawa et al.; 1995; 1996). The density of central-type benzodiazepinereceptors (CBR) decreases in the brain of Fyn-deficient mice whereas that of peripheral-typebenzodiazepine receptors (PBR) shows no significant difference between Fyn-deficient andcontrol mice (Nakamoto et al.; 1996). In the present study; we have further investigateddistributions of the CBR and the PBR by in vitro quantitative autoradiography using [3 H]flunitrazepam and [3 H] PK11195 as ligands for CBR and PBR; respectively. In Fyn-deficientmice;[3 H] flunitrazepam binding was decreased widely; particularly in front-parietal cortex;hippocampus; globus pallidus and amygdala; whereas [3 H] PK11195 binding showed nosignificant alterations.

Abnormal synaptic transmission in the olfactory system in fyn-kinase deficient mice.,Hiromasa Kitazawa; Takeshi Yagi; Kuniko Shimazaki; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa; Hiroaki Niki; Nobufumi Kawai,АННОТАЦИЯ: It has been reported that fyn expression as revealed by β-galactosidasegene (LacZ) was especially high in the limbic system and the olfactory bulb. We studiedsynaptic transmission in the olfactory system using slice preparations of mice with a mutationin fyn genes. Slices of 400-500 μm were made from the piriform cortex and the olfactorybulb; both containing the olfactory tract (OT). In the piriform cortex of homozygous Fyn-kinase deficient (fyn z/fyn z) mice; a much higher stimulus strength on OT was needed toevoke excitatory postsynaptic potentials as compared with the normal or heterozygous Fyn-deficient (+/fyn z) mice. Long-term potentiation by tetanic input stimulation was greatlyreduced or impaired in fyn z/fyn z mice.

Comprehensive behavioral analysis of tryptophan 2; 3‐dioxygenase (Tdo2) knockout mice,Satoko Hattori; Takao Keizo; Hiroshi Funakoshi; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,Abstract Tryptophan 2; 3-dioxygenase (TDO2) is an initial rate-limiting enzyme of thekynurenine (Kyn) pathway in tryptophan (Trp) metabolism. The Trp-degrading enzymes;TDO2 and indoleamine 2; 3-dioxygenase (IDO); are activated by stress and/or inflammation.Dysregulation of Trp metabolism; which causes shifts in the balance between Kyn andserotonin (5-HT) pathways; is associated with psychiatric and neurological disorders. Ingenetic studies; single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the TDO2 gene were shown to beinvolved in psychiatric disorders; such as schizophrenia and depression. It has beenreported that targeted deletion of the Tdo2 gene in mice resulted in reduced anxiety-likebehavior; enhanced exploratory activity and cognitive performance; and increased levels ofTrp and 5-HT in the hippocampus and midbrain. However; the effect of Tdo2 gene …,Neuropsychopharmacology Reports,*,*
Behavioral effects of long‐term oral administration of aluminium ammonium sulfate in male and female C57BL/6J mice,Hirotaka Shoji; Yasuhiro Irino; Masaru Yoshida; Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,Background Aluminium (Al) is considered to be a neurotoxic metal; and excessive exposureto Al has been reported to be a potential risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. Alammonium sulfate is one of the Al compounds that is widely used as a food additive.However; the effects of the oral administration of Al ammonium sulfate on physicaldevelopment and behavior remain to be examined. Methods In this study; we investigatedthe effects of the administration of Al ammonium sulfate 12-water dissolved in drinking water(0.075 mg/ml) beginning in adolescence on various types of behavior in adult femaleC57BL/6J mice through a battery of behavioral tests (low-dose experiment; Experiment 1).We further examined the behavioral effects of the oral administration of a higher dose of theAl compound in drinking water (1 mg/ml) beginning in the prenatal period on behavior in …,Neuropsychopharmacology Reports,*,*

Depression is a common and serious side effect of interferon-a (IFN-a);which limits its use as an antiviral and antitumor drug. However; the mechanism (s)underlying IFN-induced depression are largely unknown. Using a comprehensive battery ofbehavioral tests; we found that mice subjected to IFN-a treatment exhibited a depression-likephenotype. IFN-a directly suppressed NSC proliferation; resulting in the reduced generationof new neurons.

Calcineurin and Schizophrenia: Signal Transduction and Genes-to-Behaviors Pathways in Psychiatric Diseases,Tsuyoshi Miyakawa,At the time I entered the Psychology Department of the University of Tokyo in 1991; theabove description was absolutely right and every psychologist knew this fact. However; arevolutionary technology; gene targeting; changed the situation completely. Using thistechnique; specific gene of interest can be selectively modified. If one can see any specificbehavioral changes in animals having a mutation of a gene; it would mean that we pin downa gene which influences a behavior. Since then; my interest has been to reveal behavioralsignificance of genes expressed in the brain and to know how they affect behaviors. Ourbasic method to reveal behavioral significance of a gene is to conduct a systematic and well-defined behavioral test battery with mice which have mutation on the gene of interest. Thebehavioral test battery covers relatively broad range of various behavioral domains; such …,*,*,*
