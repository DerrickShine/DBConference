Statistical analysis of discontinuities in solar wind ACE data and comparison with intermittent MHD turbulence,A Greco; WH Matthaeus; S Servidio; P Chuychai; P Dmitruk,Abstract The comparison between Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) solar wind dataand simulations of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence shows a good agreement inthe waiting-time analysis of magnetic field increments. Similarity between classicaldiscontinuity identification and intermittency analysis suggests a dynamical connectionbetween solar wind discontinuities and intermittent MHD turbulence. Probability distributionfunctions of increments in ACE data and in simulations reveal a robust structure consisting ofsmall random currents; current cores; and intermittent current sheets. This adds to evidencethat solar wind magnetic structures may emerge fast and locally from MHD turbulence.,The Astrophysical Journal Letters,2009,133
Magnetic reconnection in two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic turbulence,S Servidio; WH Matthaeus; MA Shay; PA Cassak; P Dmitruk,Abstract Systematic analysis of numerical simulations of two-dimensionalmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence reveals the presence of a large number of X-type neutralpoints where magnetic reconnection occurs. We examine the statistical properties of thisensemble of reconnection events that are spontaneously generated by turbulence. Theassociated reconnection rates are distributed over a wide range of values and scales withthe geometry of the diffusion region. Locally; these events can be described through avariant of the Sweet-Parker model; in which the parameters are externally controlled byturbulence. This new perspective on reconnection is relevant in space and astrophysicalcontexts; where plasma is generally in a fully turbulent regime.,Physical review letters,2009,131
Evidence for inhomogeneous heating in the solar wind,KT Osman; WH Matthaeus; A Greco; S Servidio,Abstract Solar wind observations and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations are used toprobe the nature of turbulence heating. In particular; the electron heat flux; electrontemperature; and ion temperature in the solar wind are studied using ACE and Wind data.These heating diagnostics are also compared with MHD simulation estimates of the localdissipation density. Coherent structures; which are sources of inhomogeneity andintermittency in MHD turbulence; are found to be associated with enhancements in everyheating-related diagnostic. This supports the hypothesis that significant inhomogeneousheating occurs in the solar wind; connected with current sheets that are dynamicallygenerated by MHD turbulence. Indeed; a subset of these coherent current sheets might becandidates for magnetic reconnection. However; the specific kinetic mechanisms that …,The Astrophysical Journal Letters,2010,114
Local kinetic effects in two-dimensional plasma turbulence,S Servidio; F Valentini; F Califano; P Veltri,Abstract Using direct numerical simulations of a hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell model; kineticprocesses are investigated in a two-dimensional turbulent plasma. In the turbulent regime;kinetic effects manifest through a deformation of the ion distribution function. These patternsof non-Maxwellian features are concentrated in space nearby regions of strong magneticactivity: the distribution function is modulated by the magnetic topology; and can elongatealong or across the local magnetic field. These results open a new path on the study ofkinetic processes such as heating; particle acceleration; and temperature anisotropy;commonly observed in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas.,Physical review letters,2012,108
Intermittent MHD structures and classical discontinuities,A Greco; P Chuychai; WH Matthaeus; S Servidio; P Dmitruk,Abstract [1] We examine statistics of rapid spatial variations of the magnetic field insimulations of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence; by analyzing intermittencyproperties; and by using classical methods for identifying discontinuities. The methodsidentify similar structures; and give very similar event distribution functions. When the resultsare scaled to the correlation length; the average waiting times agree with typically reportedwaiting times between solar wind discontinuities. Thus discontinuities may be related to fluxtube boundaries and intermittent structures that appear spontaneously in MHD turbulence.,Geophysical Research Letters,2008,105
Statistics of magnetic reconnection in two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic turbulence,S Servidio; WH Matthaeus; MA Shay; P Dmitruk; PA Cassak; M Wan,The nonlinear dynamics of magnetic reconnection in turbulence is investigated throughdirect numerical simulations of decaying; incompressible; two-dimensionalmagnetohydrodynamics. Recently; it was shown by Servidio et al.[Phys. Rev. Lett. 102;115003 (2009)] that in fully developed turbulence complex processes of reconnection occurlocally. Here; the main statistical features of these multiscale reconnection events are furtherdescribed; providing details on the methodology. It is found that is possible to describe thereconnection process in turbulence as a generalized local Sweet–Parker process in whichthe parameters are locally controlled by the turbulence cascade; thus providing a steptoward reconciling classical turbulence analysis with reconnection theory. This generaldescription of reconnection may be useful for laboratory and space plasmas; where the …,Physics of Plasmas,2010,75
Depression of nonlinearity in decaying isotropic MHD turbulence,S Servidio; WH Matthaeus; P Dmitruk,Abstract Spectral method simulations show that undriven magnetohydrodynamic turbulencespontaneously generates coherent spatial correlations of several types; associated withlocal Beltrami fields; directional alignment of velocity and magnetic fields; and antialignmentof magnetic and fluid acceleration components. These correlations suppress nonlinearity tolevels lower than what is obtained from Gaussian fields; and occur in spatial patches. Wesuggest that this rapid relaxation leads to non-Gaussian statistics and spatial intermittency.,Physical review letters,2008,74
A kinetic model of plasma turbulence,S Servidio; F Valentini; D Perrone; A Greco; F Califano; WH Matthaeus; P Veltri,Abstract A Hybrid Vlasov–Maxwell (HVM) model is presented and recent results about thelink between kinetic effects and turbulence are reviewed. Using five-dimensional (2D inspace and 3D in the velocity space) simulations of plasma turbulence; it is found that kineticeffects (or non-fluid effects) manifest through the deformation of the proton velocitydistribution function (DF); with patterns of non-Maxwellian features being concentrated nearregions of strong magnetic gradients. The direction of the proper temperature anisotropy;calculated in the main reference frame of the distribution itself; has a finite probability ofbeing along or across the ambient magnetic field; in general agreement with the classicaldefinition of anisotropy T⊥/T∥(where subscripts refer to the magnetic field direction).Adopting the latter conventional definition; by varying the global plasma beta (β) and …,Journal of Plasma Physics,2015,66
Magnetic reconnection and intermittent turbulence in the solar wind,KT Osman; WH Matthaeus; JT Gosling; A Greco; S Servidio; B Hnat; Sandra C Chapman; TD Phan,Abstract A statistical relationship between magnetic reconnection; current sheets; andintermittent turbulence in the solar wind is reported for the first time using in situmeasurements from the Wind spacecraft at 1 AU. We identify intermittency as non-Gaussianfluctuations in increments of the magnetic field vector B that are spatially and temporallynonuniform. The reconnection events and current sheets are found to be concentrated inintervals of intermittent turbulence; identified using the partial variance of incrementsmethod: within the most non-Gaussian 1% of fluctuations in B; we find 87%–92% ofreconnection exhausts and∼ 9% of current sheets. Also; the likelihood that an identifiedcurrent sheet will also correspond to a reconnection exhaust increases dramatically as theleast intermittent fluctuations are removed from the data set. Hence; the turbulent solar …,Physical Review Letters,2014,65
Proton kinetic effects in Vlasov and solar wind turbulence,S Servidio; KT Osman; F Valentini; D Perrone; F Califano; S Chapman; WH Matthaeus; P Veltri,Abstract Kinetic plasma processes are investigated in the framework of solar windturbulence; employing hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell (HVM) simulations. Statistical analysis ofspacecraft observation data relates proton temperature anisotropy T⊥/T∥ and parallelplasma beta β∥; where subscripts refer to the ambient magnetic field direction. Here; thisrelationship is recovered using an ensemble of HVM simulations. By varying plasmaparameters; such as plasma beta and fluctuation level; the simulations explore distinctregions of the parameter space given by T⊥/T∥ and β∥; similar to solar wind sub-datasets.Moreover; both simulation and solar wind data suggest that temperature anisotropy is notonly associated with magnetic intermittent events; but also with gradient-type structures inthe flow and in the density.

Statistical association of discontinuities and reconnection in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence,S Servidio; A Greco; WH Matthaeus; KT Osman; P Dmitruk,Abstract [1] Using high Reynolds number simulations of two-dimensionalmagnetohydrodynamic (2-D MHD) turbulence as a test case; a statistical associationbetween tangential discontinuities and magnetic reconnection is demonstrated. Methodsemployed in previous studies on discontinuities and reconnection in turbulence are used toidentify sets of possible reconnection events along a one-dimensional path through theturbulent field; emulating experimental sampling by a single detector in a high-speed flow.The goal is to develop numerical algorithms for identifying candidate reconnection events inspace physics applications. We find that sets of strong discontinuities; identified using thenormalized partial variance of vector increments; include an increasing fraction ofreconnection events as the threshold for identification grows.

Vlasov simulations of multi-ion plasma turbulence in the solar wind,Denise Perrone; Francesco Valentini; Sergio Servidio; Serena Dalena; Pierluigi Veltri,Abstract Hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell simulations are employed to investigate the role of kineticeffects in a two-dimensional turbulent multi-ion plasma; composed of protons; alphaparticles; and fluid electrons. In the typical conditions of the solar-wind environment; and insituations of decaying turbulence; the numerical results show that the velocity distributionfunctions of both ion species depart from the typical configuration of thermal equilibrium.These non-Maxwellian features are quantified through the statistical analysis of thetemperature anisotropy; for both protons and alpha particles; in the reference frame given bythe local magnetic field. Anisotropy is found to be higher in regions of high magnetic stress.Both ion species manifest a preferentially perpendicular heating; although the anisotropy ismore pronounced for the alpha particles; according to solar wind observations.

Comment on “Kinetic simulations of magnetized turbulence in astrophysical plasmas”,WH Matthaeus; S Servidio; P Dmitruk,In a recent Letter; Howes et al. [1] (HEA) claim (i) that reported gyrokinetic simulations simultaneouslycapture both magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) cascade and small scale kinetic plasma dynamicsand (ii) that solar wind turbulence remains at low frequencies at all scales; is well described bygyrokinetics; and mainly dissipates through kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs). This Comment clarifiesand corrects these claims. First; standards for identifying an inertial range power law are stretcheddramatically by HEA. Nevertheless; HEA claims to see ''spectral slopes ... consistent with scalingpredictions for critically balanced turbulence.'' This is based on numerics that span a 32:1 ratioof largest (L?) to smallest resolved scales. Non-MHD behavior is reported at wave numberskc=!pi $ 1 near the ion inertial scale; ie; kL? $ 10 or 2.5 (Figs. 2 and 3 in [1]).

Inhomogeneous kinetic effects related to intermittent magnetic discontinuities,A Greco; F Valentini; S Servidio; WH Matthaeus,Abstract A connection between kinetic processes and two-dimensional intermittent plasmaturbulence is observed using direct numerical simulations of a hybrid Vlasov-Maxwellmodel; in which the Vlasov equation is solved for protons; while the electrons are describedas a massless fluid. During the development of turbulence; the proton distribution functionsdepart from the typical configuration of local thermodynamic equilibrium; displayingstatistically significant non-Maxwellian features. In particular; temperature anisotropy anddistortions are concentrated near coherent structures; generated as the result of theturbulent cascade; such as current sheets; which are nonuniformly distributed in space.Here; the partial variance of increments (PVI) method has been employed to identify highmagnetic stress regions within a two-dimensional turbulent pattern.

Kinetic driven turbulence: structure in space and time,TN Parashar; S Servidio; B Breech; MA Shay; WH Matthaeus,The structure in space and time of a driven turbulent magnetoplasma is analyzed usingkinetic simulations. For a two dimensional case with a strong uniform out-of-plane magneticfield; large scale driving produces a turbulent state that spans fluid scales to kinetic protonscales. There are fluid electrons in this hybrid representation. In near steady conditions;spectral analysis shows an almost complete absence of discrete point spectral features thatwould be associated with a dispersion relation and wave activity. While there is indication ofa low level of wave activity; the results show that the dynamics are dominated by nonlinearactivity. Implications for understanding plasma cascade; dissipation; and heating arediscussed.,Physics of Plasmas,2010,40
Effect of driving frequency on excitation of turbulence in a kinetic plasma,TN Parashar; S Servidio; MA Shay; B Breech; WH Matthaeus,The effect of driving frequency on the efficiency of turbulence generation through magneticforcing is studied using kinetic hybrid simulations with fully kinetic ions and fluid electrons.The efficiency of driving is quantified by examining the energy input into magnetic field aswell as the thermal energy for various driving frequencies. The driving is efficient in excitingturbulence and heating the plasma when the time period of the driving is larger than thenonlinear time of the system. For driving at faster time scales; the energy input is weak andthe steady state energy is much lower. The heating of the plasma is correlated withintermittent properties of the magnetic field; which are manifested as non-Gaussian statistics.Implications for turbulence in solar corona are discussed.,Physics of Plasmas,2011,36
Intermittency; nonlinear dynamics and dissipation in the solar wind and astrophysical plasmas,Willam H Matthaeus; Minping Wan; Sergio Servidio; A Greco; Kareem T Osman; Sean Oughton; Pablo Dmitruk,An overview is given of important properties of spatial and temporal intermittency; includingevidence of its appearance in fluids; magnetofluids and plasmas; and its implications forunderstanding of heliospheric plasmas. Spatial intermittency is generally associated withformation of sharp gradients and coherent structures. The basic physics of structuregeneration is ideal; but when dissipation is present it is usually concentrated in regions ofstrong gradients. This essential feature of spatial intermittency in fluids has been shownrecently to carry over to the realm of kinetic plasma; where the dissipation function is notknown from first principles. Spatial structures produced in intermittent plasma influencedissipation; heating; and transport and acceleration of charged particles. Temporalintermittency can give rise to very long time correlations or a delayed approach to steady …,*,2015,35
On the accuracy of simulations of turbulence,Minping Wan; Sean Oughton; S Servidio; WH Matthaeus,The widely recognized issue of adequate spatial resolution in numerical simulations ofturbulence is studied in the context of two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics. The familiarcriterion that the dissipation scale should be resolved enables accurate computation of thespectrum; but fails for precise determination of higher-order statistical quantities.Examination of two straightforward diagnostics; the maximum of the kurtosis and the scale-dependent kurtosis; enables the development of simple tests for assessing adequacy ofspatial resolution. The efficacy of the tests is confirmed by examining a sample problem; thedistribution of magnetic reconnection rates in turbulence. Oversampling the Kolmogorovdissipation scale by a factor of 3 allows accurate computation of the kurtosis; the scale-dependent kurtosis; and the reconnection rates. These tests may provide useful guidance …,Physics of Plasmas,2010,35
Local anisotropy; higher order statistics; and turbulence spectra,William H Matthaeus; Sergio Servidio; Pablo Dmitruk; V Carbone; Sean Oughton; Minping Wan; Kareem T Osman,Abstract Correlation anisotropy emerges dynamically in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD);producing stronger gradients across the large-scale mean magnetic field than along it. Thisoccurs both globally and locally; and has significant implications in space and astrophysicalplasmas; including particle scattering and transport; and theories of turbulence. Properties oflocal correlation anisotropy are further documented here by showing through numericalexperiments that the effect is intensified in more localized estimates of the mean field. Themathematical formulation of this property shows that local anisotropy mixes second-orderwith higher order correlations. Sensitivity of local statistical estimates to higher ordercorrelations can be understood in connection with the stochastic coordinate system inherentin such formulations. We demonstrate this in specific cases; and illustrate the connection …,The Astrophysical Journal,2012,33

Turbulentplasma is a major constituent of active galactic nuclei; supernova remnants; the intergalacticand interstellar medium; the solar corona; the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere;just to mention a few examples. Energy dissipation of turbulent fluctuations plays a key rolein plasma heating and energization; yet we still do not understand the underlying physicalmechanisms involved.

Hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell simulations of two-dimensional turbulence in plasmas,F Valentini; S Servidio; D Perrone; F Califano; WH Matthaeus; P Veltri,Turbulence in plasmas is a very challenging problem since it involves wave-particleinteractions; which are responsible for phenomena such as plasma dissipation; accelerationmechanisms; heating; temperature anisotropy; and so on. In this work; a hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell numerical code is employed to study local kinetic processes in a two-dimensionalturbulent regime. In the present model; ions are treated as a kinetic species; while electronsare considered as a fluid. As recently reported in [S. Servidio; Phys. Rev. Lett. 108; 045001(2012)]; nearby regions of strong magnetic activity; kinetic effects manifest through adeformation of the ion velocity distribution function that consequently departs from theequilibrium Maxwellian configuration. Here; the structure of turbulence is investigated indetail in phase space; by evaluating the high-order moments of the particle velocity …,Physics of Plasmas,2014,32
von Kármán self-preservation hypothesis for magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and its consequences for universality,Minping Wan; Sean Oughton; Sergio Servidio; William H Matthaeus,Abstract We argue that the hypothesis of preservation of shape of dimensionless second-and third-order correlations during decay of incompressible homogeneousmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence requires; in general; at least two independentsimilarity length scales. These are associated with the two Elsässer energies. The existenceof similarity solutions for the decay of turbulence with varying cross-helicity implies that theselength scales cannot remain in proportion; opening the possibility for a wide variety of decaybehaviour; in contrast to the simpler classic hydrodynamics case. Although the evolutionequations for the second-order correlations lack explicit dependence on either the meanmagnetic field or the magnetic helicity; there is inherent implicit dependence on these (andother) quantities through the third-order correlations. The self-similar inertial range; a …,Journal of Fluid Mechanics,2012,32
Statistical properties of ideal three-dimensional Hall magnetohydrodynamics: The spectral structure of the equilibrium ensemble,Sergio Servidio; William H Matthaeus; Vincenzo Carbone,The nonlinear dynamics of ideal; incompressible Hall magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD) isinvestigated through classical Gibbs ensemble methods applied to the finite Galerkinrepresentation. The spectral structure of HMHD is derived in a three-dimensional periodicgeometry and compared with the MHD case. This provides a general picture of spectraltransfer and cascade by the assumption that ideal Galerkin HMHD follows equilibriumstatistics as in the case of Euler [U. Frisch et al.; J. Fluid Mech. 68; 769 (1975)] and MHD [T.Stribling and WH Matthaeus; Phys. Fluids B 2; 1979 (1990)] theories. In HMHD; theequilibrium ensemble is built on the conservation of three quadratic invariants: The totalenergy; the magnetic helicity; and the generalized helicity. The latter replaces the crosshelicity in MHD. In HMHD equilibrium; several differences appear with respect to the MHD …,Physics of Plasmas,2008,32
Compressible turbulence in Hall magnetohydrodynamics,Sergio Servidio; Vincenzo Carbone; Leonardo Primavera; P Veltri; Kristof Stasiewicz,Abstract By direct numerical simulations we investigate the nonlinear dynamics of acompressible Hall Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasma. At small scales; where the Halleffect dominates; we found an increase of the compressibility of the system and thebreakdown of the strong link between velocity and magnetic fields; typical of usual MHD.Moreover; we find that small-scale fluctuations are characterized by an anti-correlationbetween density and magnetic field intensity. These features characterize the excitation of aquasi-perpendicular magnetosonic turbulence that can be interpreted as the small-scalesignature of the break-down of the MHD nonlinear energy cascade due to Hall effect.Fluctuations with the same properties; based on measurements by Cluster spacecraft inspace plasma turbulence during different magnetopause crossings; have been recently …,Planetary and Space Science,2007,32
Generation of non-Gaussian statistics and coherent structures in ideal magnetohydrodynamics,Minping Wan; Sean Oughton; Sergio Servidio; William H Matthaeus,Spectral method simulations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics are used to investigateproduction of coherent small scale structures; a feature of fluid models that is usuallyassociated with inertial range signatures of nonuniform dissipation; and the associatedemergence of non-Gaussian statistics. The near-identical growth of non-Gaussianity in idealand nonideal cases suggests that generation of coherent structures and breaking of self-similarity are essentially ideal processes. This has important implications for understandingthe origin of intermittency in turbulence.,Physics of Plasmas,2009,31

A possible phenomenon of clusterization of thesediscontinuities is studied in detail. We perform a local Poisson's analysis in order to establishif these intermittent events are randomly distributed or not. Possible implications about thenature of solar wind discontinuities are discussed.,Physical Review E,2009,29
The complex structure of magnetic field discontinuities in the turbulent solar wind,Antonella Greco; Silvia Perri; Sergio Servidio; Emiliya Yordanova; P Veltri,Abstract Using high-resolution Cluster satellite observations and a multi-dimensionalintermittency technique; we show that the magnetic discontinuities in the turbulent solar windare connected through the spatial scales; going from proton down to electron scales. Insome circumstances; their structure resembles the Harris equilibrium profile in plasmas.Observations are consistent with a scenario where many current layers develop inturbulence and where the outflow of these reconnection events are characterized bycomplex sub-proton networks of secondary islands; in a self-similar way. Although in thepast these pictures have been speculated to be separately ubiquitous; through theories andsimulations; the present work confirms that" reconnection in turbulence" and" turbulentreconnection" coexist in space plasmas.,The Astrophysical Journal Letters,2016,25
Intermittent structures and magnetic discontinuities on small scales in MHD simulations and solar wind,A Greco; S Servidio; WH Matthaeus; P Dmitruk,Abstract In this work we review some recent studies; in which properties of the magnetic fieldin high resolution simulations of MHD turbulence with spacecraft data are compared;focusing on methods used to identify classical discontinuities and intermittency statistics.Comparison of ACE solar wind data and simulations of MHD turbulence showed goodagreement in waiting-time analysis of magnetic discontinuities; and in the related distributionof magnetic field increments. Further analyses showed that the magnetic discontinuities arenot distributed without correlations; but rather that non-Poisson correlations; possibly in theform of burstiness or voids; are present in the data at least up to the typical correlation scale.The discontinuities or bursty coherent structures represent in this view the current sheets thatform between magnetic flux tubes which may be a signature of intermittent; anisotropic …,Planetary and Space Science,2010,25
The third-order law for increments in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence with constant shear,Minping Wan; Sergio Servidio; Sean Oughton; William H Matthaeus,We extend the theory for third-order structure functions in homogeneous incompressiblemagnetohydrodynamic turbulence to the case in which a constant velocity shear is present.A generalization is found of the usual relation [Politano and Pouquet; Phys. Rev. E 57; 21(1998)] between third-order structure functions and the dissipation rate in steady inertialrange turbulence; in which the shear plays a crucial role. In particular; the presence of shearleads to a third-order law which is not simply proportional to the relative separation. Possibleimplications for laboratory and space plasmas are discussed.,Physics of plasmas,2009,25
Nonlinear and linear timescales near kinetic scales in solar wind turbulence,William H Matthaeus; Sean Oughton; Kareem T Osman; Sergio Servidio; Minping Wan; SP Gary; MA Shay; F Valentini; V Roytershteyn; H Karimabadi; SC Chapman,Abstract The application of linear kinetic treatments to plasma waves; damping; andinstability requires favorable inequalities between the associated linear timescales andtimescales for nonlinear (eg; turbulence) evolution. In the solar wind these two types oftimescales may be directly compared using standard Kolmogorov-style analysis andobservational data. The estimated local (in scale) nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic cascadetimes; evaluated as relevant kinetic scales are approached; remain slower than the cyclotronperiod; but comparable to or faster than the typical timescales of instabilities; anisotropicwaves; and wave damping. The variation with length scale of the turbulence timescales issupported by observations and simulations. On this basis the use of linear theory—whichassumes constant parameters to calculate the associated kinetic rates—may be …,The Astrophysical Journal,2014,24
Emergence of very long time fluctuations and 1/f noise in ideal flows,P Dmitruk; PD Mininni; Annick Pouquet; S Servidio; WH Matthaeus,Abstract This paper shows the connection between three previously observed but seeminglyunrelated phenomena in hydrodynamic (HD) and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulentflows; involving the emergence of fluctuations occurring on very long time scales: the low-frequency 1/f noise in the power frequency spectrum; the delayed ergodicity of complexvalued amplitude fluctuations in wave number space; and the spontaneous flippings orreversals of large-scale fields. Direct numerical simulations of ideal MHD and HD areemployed in three space dimensions; at low resolution; for long periods of time; and withhigh accuracy to study several cases: different geometries; presence of rotation and/or auniform magnetic field; and different values of the associated conserved global quantities. Itis conjectured that the origin of all these long-time phenomena is rooted in the interaction …,Physical Review E,2011,24
Interchange reconnection in a turbulent corona,AF Rappazzo; WH Matthaeus; D Ruffolo; S Servidio; M Velli,Abstract Magnetic reconnection at the interface between coronal holes and loops; the so-called interchange reconnection; can release the hotter; denser plasma from magneticallyconfined regions into the heliosphere; contributing to the formation of the highly variableslow solar wind. The interchange process is often thought to develop at the apex ofstreamers or pseudo-streamers; near Y-and X-type neutral points; but slow streams withloop composition have been recently observed along fanlike open field lines adjacent toclosed regions; far from the apex. However; coronal heating models; with magnetic fieldlines shuffled by convective motions; show that reconnection can occur continuously inunipolar magnetic field regions with no neutral points: photospheric motions induce amagnetohydrodynamic turbulent cascade in the coronal field that creates the necessary …,The Astrophysical Journal Letters,2012,23
Hydrodynamic relaxation of an electron plasma to a near-maximum entropy state,DJ Rodgers; S Servidio; WH Matthaeus; DC Montgomery; TB Mitchell; T Aziz,Abstract Dynamical relaxation of a pure electron plasma in a Malmberg-Penning trap isstudied; comparing experiments; numerical simulations and statistical theories of weaklydissipative two-dimensional (2D) turbulence. Simulations confirm that the dynamics areapproximated well by a 2D hydrodynamic model. Statistical analysis favors a theoreticalpicture of relaxation to a near-maximum entropy state with constrained energy; circulation;and angular momentum. This provides evidence that 2D electron fluid relaxation in aturbulent regime is governed by principles of maximum entropy.,Physical review letters,2009,21
Dissipation and reconnection in boundary-driven reduced magnetohydrodynamics,Minping Wan; Antonio Franco Rappazzo; William H Matthaeus; Sergio Servidio; Sean Oughton,Abstract We study the statistics of coherent current sheets; the population of X-type criticalpoints; and reconnection rates in a coronal loop geometry; via numerical simulations ofreduced magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. Current sheets and sites of reconnection(magnetic X-points) are identified in two-dimensional planes of the three-dimensionalsimulation domain. The geometry of the identified current sheets—including area; length;and width—and the magnetic dissipation occurring in the current sheets are statisticallycharacterized. We also examine the role of magnetic reconnection; by computing thereconnection rates at the identified X-points and investigating their association with currentsheets.,The Astrophysical Journal,2014,20
Generation of X-points and secondary islands in 2D magnetohydrodynamic turbulence,Minping Wan; William H Matthaeus; Sergio Servidio; Sean Oughton,We study the time development of the population of X-type critical points in a two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model during the early stages of freely decayingturbulence. At sufficiently high magnetic Reynolds number Rem; we find that the number ofneutral points increases as R em 3/2; while the rates of reconnection at the most active sitesdecrease. The distribution of rates remains approximately exponential. We focus inparticular on delicate issues of accuracy; which arise in these numerical experiments; in thatthe proliferation of X-points is also a feature of under-resolved simulations. The “splitting” ofneutral points at high Reynolds number appears to be a fundamental feature of the cascadethat has important implications for understanding the relationship between reconnection andturbulence; an issue of considerable importance for the Magnetospheric Multiscale and …,Physics of Plasmas,2013,19
The third-order law for magnetohydrodynamic turbulence with shear: Numerical investigation,Minping Wan; Sergio Servidio; Sean Oughton; William H Matthaeus,The scaling laws of third-order structure functions for isotropic; homogeneous; andincompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence relate the observable structurefunction with the energy dissipation rate. Recently [Wan et al. Phys. Plasmas 16; 090703(2009)]; the theory was extended to the case in which a constant velocity shear is present;motivated by the application of the third-order law to the solar wind. We use direct numericalsimulations of two-dimensional MHD with shear to confirm this new generalization of thetheory. The presence of the shear effect broadens the circumstances in which the law can beapplied. Important implications for laboratory and space plasmas are discussed.,Physics of Plasmas,2010,19
Magnetic field line random walk in models and simulations of reduced magnetohydrodynamic turbulence,AP Snodin; D Ruffolo; Sean Oughton; Sergio Servidio; William H Matthaeus,Abstract The random walk of magnetic field lines is examined numerically and analytically inthe context of reduced magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) turbulence; which provides a usefuldescription of plasmas dominated by a strong mean field; such as in the solar corona. Arecently developed non-perturbative theory of magnetic field line diffusion is compared withthe diffusion coefficients obtained by accurate numerical tracing of magnetic field lines forboth synthetic models and direct numerical simulations of RMHD. Statistical analysis of anensemble of trajectories confirms the applicability of the theory; which very closely matchesthe numerical field line diffusion coefficient as a function of distance z along the meanmagnetic field for a wide range of the Kubo number R.

Reconnection events in two-dimensional Hall magnetohydrodynamic turbulence,S Donato; S Servidio; P Dmitruk; V Carbone; MA Shay; PA Cassak; WH Matthaeus,The statistical study of magnetic reconnection events in two-dimensional turbulence hasbeen performed by comparing numerical simulations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) andHall magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD). The analysis reveals that the Hall term plays animportant role in turbulence; in which magnetic islands simultaneously reconnect in acomplex way. In particular; an increase of the Hall parameter; the ratio of ion skin depth tosystem size; broadens the distribution of reconnection rates relative to the MHD case.Moreover; in HMHD the local geometry of the reconnection region changes; manifestingbifurcated current sheets and quadrupolar magnetic field structures in analogy to laminarstudies; leading locally to faster reconnection processes in this case of reconnectionembedded in turbulence. This study supports the idea that the global rate of energy …,Physics of Plasmas,2012,18
Evidence for nonlinear development of magnetohydrodynamic scale intermittency in the inner heliosphere,A Greco; WH Matthaeus; R D'amicis; S Servidio; P Dmitruk,Abstract The formation of coherent structures in turbulence is a signature of a developingcascade and therefore might be observable by analyzing inner heliospheric solar windturbulence. To test this idea; data from the Helios 2 mission; for six streams of solar wind atdifferent heliocentric distances and of different velocities; were subjected to statisticalanalysis using the partial variance of increments (PVI) approach. We see a clear increase ofthe PVI distribution function versus solar wind age for higher PVI cutoff; indicatingdevelopment of non-Gaussian coherent structures. The plausibility of this interpretation isconfirmed by a similar behavior observed in two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamicssimulation data at corresponding dimensionless nonlinear times.,The Astrophysical Journal,2012,17
Kinetic Alfvén wave generation by large-scale phase mixing,CL Vásconez; F Pucci; F Valentini; S Servidio; WH Matthaeus; F Malara,Abstract One view of the solar wind turbulence is that the observed highly anisotropicfluctuations at spatial scales near the proton inertial length dp may be considered as kineticAlfvén waves (KAWs). In the present paper; we show how phase mixing of large-scaleparallel-propagating Alfvén waves is an efficient mechanism for the production of KAWs atwavelengths close to dp and at a large propagation angle with respect to the magnetic field.Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD); Hall magnetohydrodynamic (HMHD); and hybrid Vlasov–Maxwell (HVM) simulations modeling the propagation of Alfvén waves in inhomogeneousplasmas are performed. In the linear regime; the role of dispersive effects is singled out bycomparing MHD and HMHD results. Fluctuations produced by phase mixing are identifiedas KAWs through a comparison of polarization of magnetic fluctuations and wave-group …,The Astrophysical Journal,2015,15
On the origin of anisotropy in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence: the role of higher-order correlations,Sean Oughton; Minping Wan; Sergio Servidio; William H Matthaeus,Abstract Evolution of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is often discussed in terms ofsecond-order statistics like the energy spectra; but consideration of the structure of the vonKármán-Howarth hierarchy for MHD indicates that higher-order statistical correlationsoccupy an influential role. Here we show that both spectral anisotropy and energy decay arestrongly associated with higher-order statistics. Dynamical emergence of spectral anisotropymust occur at a higher order in the statistical hierarchy; while numerical evidence suggeststhat strong variations in energy decay are connected with variations in higher-orderstatistics.,The Astrophysical Journal,2013,12
Ergodicity of ideal Galerkin three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics and Hall magnetohydrodynamics models,S Servidio; WH Matthaeus; V Carbone,Abstract We explore the problem of the ergodicity of magnetohydrodynamics and Hallmagnetohydrodynamics in three-dimensional; ideal Galerkin systems that are truncated to afinite number of Fourier modes. We show how single Fourier modes follow the Gibbsensemble prediction; and how the ergodicity of the phase space is restored for long-timeGalerkin solutions. Running time averages and two-time correlation functions show; at longtimes; a convergence towards zero of time averaged single Fourier modes. This suggests adelayed approach to; rather than a breaking of; ergodicity. Finally; we present somepreliminary ideas concerning the origin of the associated time scales.,Physical Review E,2008,11
Time decorrelation in isotropic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence,S Servidio; V Carbone; P Dmitruk; WH Matthaeus,Abstract Time decorrelation in isotropic incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)turbulence is studied using three-dimensional numerical simulation. Eulerian andwavenumber-dependent correlation functions are obtained. Scaling with wavenumberseparates effects of nonlinear distortion and effects of random sweeping and Alfvénic wavepropagation. Results show that the dominant effect is the combined influence of convectivesweeping and Alfvénic propagation; both being nonlocal effects on small-scale fluctuationsby large-scale fluctuations. This conclusion finds applications in space plasma observation;particle scattering; predictability; and turbulence theory.,EPL (Europhysics Letters),2011,10
Local relaxation and maximum entropy in two-dimensional turbulence,S Servidio; M Wan; WH Matthaeus; V Carbone,The phenomenon of vortex merging in two-dimensional hydrodynamics has beeninvestigated through direct numerical simulations. The fast and local processes that occurduring the turbulent relaxation of a randomly initialized system in periodic geometry havebeen examined. The analysis reveals that many of the coherent structures can be describedby a local principle of maximization of entropy. The validity of this entropy principle has beenfurther confirmed by time-dependent statistics using a contour-tracking technique.Implications for the description of persistent coherent vortices commonly observed in natureare suggested; including growing evidence for the wide applicability of maximum entropy-based relaxation principles.,Physics of Fluids,2010,10
Revisiting a classic: the Parker–Moffatt problem,O Pezzi; TN Parashar; S Servidio; F Valentini; CL Vásconez; Y Yang; F Malara; WH Matthaeus; P Veltri,Abstract The interaction of two colliding Alfvén wave packets is described here by means ofmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and hybrid kinetic numerical simulations. The MHDevolution revisits the theoretical insights described by Moffatt; Parker; Kraichnan;Chandrasekhar; and Elsässer in which the oppositely propagating large-amplitude wavepackets interact for a finite time; initiating turbulence. However; the extension to includecompressive and kinetic effects; while maintaining the gross characteristics of the simplerclassic formulation; also reveals intriguing features that go beyond the pure MHD treatment.,The Astrophysical Journal,2017,9
Nonlinear dynamics of inviscid reduced MHD plasmas: the appearance of quasi-single-helicity states,Sergio Servidio; Vincenzo Carbone,Abstract The nonlinear dynamics of an inviscid magnetohydrodynamic system in a low-βplasma is investigated through a simplified model obtained by a Galerkin projection. Weshow that a single Fourier mode dominates over the whole energy spectrum; a self-organization mechanism of turbulence being responsible for this nonlinear effect. Our resultsare in agreement with observations of an analogous phenomenon; say; the emergence of aquasi-single-helicity state both in numerical simulations and real experiments in reversedfield pinch laboratory plasmas.,Physical review letters,2005,9
Differential kinetic dynamics and heating of ions in the turbulent solar wind,F Valentini; D Perrone; S Stabile; O Pezzi; S Servidio; R De Marco; F Marcucci; Roberto Bruno; B Lavraud; J De Keyser; G Consolini; D Brienza; L Sorriso-Valvo; Alessandro Retinò; Andris Vaivads; M Salatti; P Veltri,Abstract The solar wind plasma is a fully ionized and turbulent gas ejected by the outerlayers of the solar corona at very high speed; mainly composed by protons and electrons;with a small percentage of helium nuclei and a significantly lower abundance of heavierions. Since particle collisions are practically negligible; the solar wind is typically not in astate of thermodynamic equilibrium. Such a complex system must be described through self-consistent and fully nonlinear models; taking into account its multi-species composition andturbulence. We use a kinetic hybrid Vlasov–Maxwell numerical code to reproduce theturbulent energy cascade down to ion kinetic scales; in typical conditions of theuncontaminated solar wind plasma; with the aim of exploring the differential kineticdynamics of the dominant ion species; namely protons and alpha particles. We show that …,New Journal of Physics,2016,8
From Alfvén waves to kinetic Alfvén waves in an inhomogeneous equilibrium structure,Francesco Pucci; Christian L Vasconez; Oreste Pezzi; Sergio Servidio; Francesco Valentini; William H Matthaeus; Francesco Malara,Abstract Kinetic Alfvén waves are believed to primary form fluctuations in a hydromagneticturbulence at scales of the order of the ion inertial length. We study a model where an initialAlfvén wave propagates inside an equilibrium structure which is inhomogeneous in thedirection perpendicular to the equilibrium magnetic field. In a previous paper this situationhas been considered in a particular configuration where the initial wave vector is parallel tothe magnetic field and the wave is polarized perpendicular to the inhomogeneity direction.Here we consider other configurations; with a different polarization and possible initialoblique propagation. We employ numerical simulations; using both a Hall-magnetohydrodynamics and a Hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell model. Results show that in all theconsidered cases the time evolution leads to the formation of kinetic Alfvén waves within …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2016,8

Plasma phenomena in space give rise to energetic particles; theaurora; solar flares and coronal mass ejections; as well as many energetic phenomena ininterstellar space. Although plasmas can be studied in laboratory settings; it is often difficult;if not impossible; to replicate the conditions (density; temperature; magnetic and electricfields; etc.) of space. Single-point space missions too numerous to list have described manyproperties of near-Earth and heliospheric plasmas as measured both in situ and remotely(see http://www. nasa. gov/missions/#.

A model for two-dimensional bursty turbulence in magnetized plasmas,Sergio Servidio; Leonardo Primavera; Vincenzo Carbone; Alain Noullez; Kristoffer Rypdal,The nonlinear dynamics of two-dimensional electrostatic interchange modes in amagnetized plasma is investigated through a simple model that replaces the instabilitymechanism due to magnetic field curvature by an external source of vorticity and mass.Simulations in a cylindrical domain; with a spatially localized and randomized source at thecenter of the domain; reveal the eruption of mushroom-shaped bursts that propagate radiallyand are absorbed by the boundaries. Burst sizes and the interburst waiting times exhibitpower-law statistics; which indicates long-range interburst correlations; similar to what hasbeen found in sandpile models for avalanching systems. It is shown from the simulations thatthe dynamics can be characterized by a Yaglom relation for the third-order mixed momentinvolving the particle number density as a passive scalar and the E× B drift velocity; and …,Physics of Plasmas,2008,8
Colliding Alfvénic wave packets in magnetohydrodynamics; Hall and kinetic simulations,O Pezzi; TN Parashar; S Servidio; F Valentini; CL Vásconez; Y Yang; F Malara; WH Matthaeus; P Veltri,Abstract The analysis of the Parker–Moffatt problem; recently revisited in Pezzi etal.(Astrophys. J.; vol. 834; 2017; p. 166); is here extended by including Hallmagnetohydrodynamics and two hybrid kinetic Vlasov–Maxwell numerical models. Thepresence of dispersive and kinetic features is studied in detail and a comparison betweenthe two kinetic codes is also reported. Focus on the presence of non-Maxwellian signaturesshows that–during the collision–regions characterized by strong temperature anisotropy arerecovered and the proton distribution function displays a beam along the direction of themagnetic field; similar to some recent observations of the solar wind.,Journal of Plasma Physics,2017,7
Multifractal scaling and intermittency in hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell simulations of plasma turbulence,E Leonardis; L Sorriso-Valvo; F Valentini; S Servidio; F Carbone; P Veltri,By employing Hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell simulations in 2D-3V phase space configuration (2Din physical space and 3D in velocity space) of plasma turbulence; the statistical properties ofthe energy cascade at kinetic scales have been investigated. High-order moments of themagnetic field fluctuations have been inspected in order to quantify the intermittencyphenomenon. At scales l larger than the ion skin depth di; fluctuations exhibit anomalousscaling; suggesting the presence of a multifractal intermittent turbulent cascade. For l< di;fluctuations show monoscaling; indicating Gaussian statistics. This scenario is consistentwith the statistics of the dissipation fields J· E and J 2; suggesting that the processes ofdissipation; intended as a conversion of energy from electromagnetic fluctuations to electronOhmic heating and non-thermal proton effects; occur non-homogeneously in space.,Physics of Plasmas,2016,7
Sign singularity and flares in solar active region NOAA 11158,Luca Sorriso-Valvo; Gaetano De Vita; Maria D Kazachenko; Sam Krucker; Leonardo Primavera; Sergio Servidio; Antonio Vecchio; Brian T Welsch; George H Fisher; Fabio Lepreti; Vincenzo Carbone,Abstract Solar Active Region NOAA 11158 has hosted a number of strong flares; includingone X2. 2 event. The complexity of current density and current helicity are studied throughcancellation analysis of their sign-singular measure; which features power-law scaling.Spectral analysis is also performed; revealing the presence of two separate scaling rangeswith different spectral index. The time evolution of parameters is discussed. Suddenchanges of the cancellation exponents at the time of large flares and the presence ofcorrelation with Extreme-Ultra-Violet and X-ray flux suggest that eruption of large flares canbe linked to the small-scale properties of the current structures.,The Astrophysical Journal,2015,7
Analysis of intermittent heating in a multi-component turbulent plasma,Denise Perrone; Francesco Valentini; Sergio Servidio; Serena Dalena; Pierluigi Veltri,Abstract Kinetic effects and turbulence are two phenomena that characterize the solar wind;and; therefore; kinetic models represent the best tool of investigation for this collisionlessplasma. In this work; hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell simulations are performed to investigate theintermittent heating of the solar wind; in a two-dimensional multi-ion plasma composed byprotons; alpha particles and fluid electrons. The numerical results show that particledistribution functions depart from the typical Maxwellian configuration under the effect of theturbulence. Both ion species develop temperature anisotropy; with respect to the localmagnetic field; that increases during the development of the turbulent cascade. During thenonlinear evolution of the system; coherent structures (vortices and current sheets) appearin physical space; related to the intermittent nature of the magnetic field.

Complexity and diffusion of magnetic flux surfaces in anisotropic turbulence,S Servidio; WH Matthaeus; M Wan; D Ruffolo; AF Rappazzo; S Oughton,Abstract The complexity of magnetic flux surfaces is investigated analytically andnumerically in static homogeneous magnetic turbulence. Magnetic surfaces are computed tolarge distances in magnetic fields derived from a reduced magnetohydrodynamic model.The question addressed is whether one can define magnetic surfaces over large distanceswhen turbulence is present. Using a flux surface spectral analysis; we show that magneticsurfaces become complex at small scales; experiencing an exponential thinning that isquantified here. The computation of a flux surface is of either exponential or nondeterministicpolynomial complexity; which has the conceptual implication that global identification ofmagnetic flux surfaces and flux exchange; eg; in magnetic reconnection; can be intractablein three dimensions.

Magnetospheric Multiscale Observation of Plasma Velocity-Space Cascade: Hermite Representation and Theory,S Servidio; A Chasapis; WH Matthaeus; D Perrone; F Valentini; TN Parashar; P Veltri; D Gershman; CT Russell; B Giles; SA Fuselier; TD Phan; J Burch,Abstract Plasma turbulence is investigated using unprecedented high-resolution ion velocitydistribution measurements by the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission (MMS) in the Earth'smagnetosheath. This novel observation of a highly structured particle distribution suggests acascadelike process in velocity space. Complex velocity space structure is investigatedusing a three-dimensional Hermite transform; revealing; for the first time in observationaldata; a power-law distribution of moments. In analogy to hydrodynamics; a Kolmogorovapproach leads directly to a range of predictions for this phase-space transport. The scalingtheory is found to be in agreement with observations.

Kinetic cascade in solar-wind turbulence: 3D3V hybrid-kinetic simulations with electron inertia,Silvio Sergio Cerri; Sergio Servidio; Francesco Califano,Abstract Understanding the nature of the turbulent fluctuations below the ion gyroradius insolar-wind (SW) turbulence is a great challenge. Recent studies have been mostly in favor ofkinetic Alfvén wave (KAW)-type fluctuations; but other kinds of fluctuations withcharacteristics typical of magnetosonic; whistler; and ion-Bernstein modes could also play arole depending on the plasma parameters. Here; we investigate the properties of thesubproton-scale cascade with high-resolution hybrid-kinetic simulations of freely decayingturbulence in 3D3V phase space; including electron inertia effects. Two proton plasma betaare explored: the" intermediate" β p= 1 and" low" β p= 0.2 regimes; both typically observed inthe SW and corona. The magnetic energy spectum exhibits ${k} _ {\perp}^{-8/3} $ and ${k} _{\parallel}^{-7/2} $ power laws at β p= 1; while they are slightly steeper at β p= 0.2 …,The Astrophysical Journal Letters,2017,6
Transition to kinetic turbulence at proton scales driven by large-amplitude kinetic Alfvén fluctuations,F Valentini; CL Vásconez; O Pezzi; S Servidio; F Malara; F Pucci,Space plasmas are dominated by the presence of large-amplitude waves; large-scaleinhomogeneities; kinetic effects and turbulence. Beside the homogeneous turbulence; thegeneration of small scale fluctuations can take place also in other realistic configurations;namely; when perturbations superpose to an inhomogeneous background magnetic field.When an Alfvén wave propagates in a medium where the Alfvén speed varies in a directiontransverse to the mean field; it undergoes phase-mixing; which progressively bendswavefronts; generating small scales in the transverse direction. As soon as transversescales become of the order of the proton inertial length dp; kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs) arenaturally generated. KAWs belong to the branch of Alfvén waves and propagate almostperpendicularly to the ambient magnetic field; at scales close to d p. Many numerical …,Astronomy & Astrophysics,2017,6
Two-fluid numerical simulations of turbulence inside Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices: Intermittency and reconnecting current sheets,Claudia Rossi; Francesco Califano; Alessandro Retinò; Luca Sorriso-Valvo; Pierre Henri; Sergio Servidio; Francesco Valentini; Alexandros Chasapis; Laurence Rezeau,The turbulence developing inside Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices has been studied using a two-fluid numerical simulation. From an initial large-scale velocity shear; the nonlinear evolutionof the instability leads to the formation of a region inside the initial vortex characterized bysmall-scale fluctuations and structures. The magnetic energy spectrum is compatible with aKolmogorov-like power-law decay; followed by a steeper power-law below proton scales; inagreement with other studies. The magnetic field increments show non-Gaussiandistributions with increasing tails going towards smaller scales; consistent with presence ofintermittency. The strong magnetic field fluctuations populating the tails of the distributionshave been identified as current sheets by using the Partial Variance of the Increments (PVI)method. The strongest current sheets (largest PVI) appear around proton scales and …,Physics of Plasmas,2015,6
Magnetic field reversals and long-time memory in conducting flows,P Dmitruk; Pablo Daniel Mininni; A Pouquet; S Servidio; WH Matthaeus,Abstract Employing a simple ideal magnetohydrodynamic model in spherical geometry; weshow that the presence of either rotation or finite magnetic helicity is sufficient to inducedynamical reversals of the magnetic dipole moment. The statistical character of the model issimilar to that of terrestrial magnetic field reversals; with the similarity being stronger whenrotation is present. The connection between long-time correlations; 1/f noise; and statistics ofreversals is supported; consistent with earlier suggestions.,Physical Review E,2014,6
How to identify reconnecting current sheets in incompressible Hall MHD turbulence,S Donato; A Greco; WH Matthaeus; S Servidio; P Dmitruk,Abstract [1] Using high Reynolds number simulations of two-dimensional Hallmagnetohydrodynamics (HMHD) turbulence; a statistical association between magneticdiscontinuities and magnetic reconnection is demonstrated. We find that sets ofdiscontinuities; identified using the normalized partial variance of vector increments (PVImethod); strongly depend on threshold in PVI statistic that is used as an identifying conditionand on the strength of the Hall term. The analysis confirms that the Hall term plays animportant role in turbulence and it affects the methods employed for detection ofreconnecting current sheets. In particular; we found the following:(1) Among all thediscontinuities detected by the PVI method; the reconnecting ones are on averagethinner.(2) A reduction in size of all discontinuities and of reconnecting current sheets is …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2013,6
A review of relaxation and structure in some turbulent plasmas: magnetohydrodynamics and related models,William H Matthaeus; David C Montgomery; Minping Wan; Sergio Servidio,A brief overview is provided as an introduction to hydrodynamic-like turbulence thatcharacterizes the dynamics of plasmas in several parameter regimes. This includesmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD); the electron fluid plasma; which is closely related to two-dimensional hydrodynamics; and the solar wind; which is usually viewed as a laboratory forthree-dimensional MHD; with more involved plasma physics at the dissipative scales. Anemphasis is placed on energy decay; spectra; relaxation processes; coherent structures;and higher statistics with selected applications in solar wind and laboratory plasmas.,Journal of Turbulence,2012,6
Dispersive effects of Hall electric field in turbulence,WH Matthaeus; S Servidio; P Dmitruk,A familiar feature of turbulence in a low collisionality turbulence is an increase in the electricfield spectrum; relative to the magnetic field spectrum; at wavenumbers near the reciprocalof the ion inertial scale. This effect is commonly observed in the solar wind. Here weexamine this feature numerically; using a variety of simulations; including compressible HallMHD; incompressible Hall MHD; and one‐; two‐; and three‐dimensional cases. A feature ofthis type is even found in a statistical Hall MHD model with no dissipation. This leads to theconclusion that the only requirement for obtaining this dispersive effect is the Hall term in thegeneralized Ohm's law. Therefore this observation does not distinguish between whistlerand kinetic Alfvén waves; between waves and turbulence; nor even between fluid andkinetic plasma models.,AIP conference proceedings,2010,6
Relaxation processes in solar wind turbulence,S Servidio; C Gurgiolo; V Carbone; ML Goldstein,Abstract Based on global conservation principles; magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) relaxationtheory predicts the existence of several equilibria; such as the Taylor state or global dynamicalignment. These states are generally viewed as very long-time and large-scale equilibria;which emerge only after the termination of the turbulent cascade. As suggested byhydrodynamics and by recent MHD numerical simulations; relaxation processes can occurduring the turbulent cascade that will manifest themselves as local patches of equilibrium-like configurations. Using multi-spacecraft analysis techniques in conjunction with Clusterdata; we compute the current density and flow vorticity and for the first time demonstrate thatthese localized relaxation events are observed in the solar wind. Such events haveimportant consequences for the statistics of plasma turbulence.,The Astrophysical Journal Letters,2014,5
Exploring the statistics of magnetic reconnection X-points in kinetic particle-in-cell turbulence,Colby C Haggerty; Tulasi N Parashar; William H Matthaeus; Michael A Shay; Yan Yang; Minping Wan; Penny Wu; Sergio Servidio,Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous phenomenon in turbulent plasmas. It is an importantpart of the turbulent dynamics and heating of space and astrophysical plasmas. We examinethe statistics of magnetic reconnection using a quantitative local analysis of the magneticvector potential; previously used in magnetohydrodynamics simulations; and now employedto fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. Different ways of reducing the particle noisefor analysis purposes; including multiple smoothing techniques; are explored. We find that aFourier filter applied at the Debye scale is an optimal choice for analyzing PIC data. Finally;we find a broader distribution of normalized reconnection rates compared to the MHD limitwith rates as large as 0.5 but with an average of approximately 0.1.,Physics of Plasmas,2017,4
Numerical Study on the Validity of the Taylor Hypothesis in Space Plasmas,Silvia Perri; Sergio Servidio; Andris Vaivads; Francesco Valentini,Abstract In situ heliospheric measurements allow us to resolve fluctuations as a function offrequency. A crucial point is to describe the power spectral density as a function of thewavenumber; in order to understand the energy cascade through the scales in terms ofplasma turbulence theories. The most favorable situation occurs when the average windspeed is much higher than the phase speed of the plasma modes; equivalent to the fact thatthe fluctuations' dynamical times are much longer than their typical crossing period throughthe spacecraft (frozen-in Taylor approximation). Using driven compressible Hall-magneothydrodynamics simulations; in which an" imaginary" spacecraft flies across a time-evolving turbulence; here we explore the limitations of the frozen-in assumption. We find thatthe Taylor hypothesis is robust down to sub-proton scales; especially for flows with mean …,The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series,2017,4
Importance of energy and angular resolutions in top-hat electrostatic analysers for solar wind proton measurements,R De Marco; MF Marcucci; R Bruno; R D'Amicis; S Servidio; F Valentini; B Lavraud; P Louarn; M Salatti,Abstract We use a numerical code which reproduces the angular/energy response of atypical top-hat electrostatic analyser starting from solar wind proton velocity distributionfunctions (VDFs) generated by numerical simulations. The simulations are based on theHybrid Vlasov-Maxwell numerical algorithm which integrates the Vlasov equation for the iondistribution function; while the electrons are treated as a fluid. A virtual satellite launchedthrough the simulation box measures the particle VDFs. Such VDFs are moved from thesimulation Cartesian grid to energy-angular coordinates to mimic the response of a realsensor in the solar wind. Different energy-angular resolutions of the analyser areinvestigated in order to understand the influence of the phase-space resolution in existingand upcoming space missions; with regards to determining the key parameters of plasma …,Journal of Instrumentation,2016,4
Explosive Particle Dispersion in Plasma Turbulence,S Servidio; CT Haynes; WH Matthaeus; D Burgess; V Carbone; P Veltri,Abstract Particle dynamics are investigated in plasma turbulence; using self-consistentkinetic simulations; in two dimensions. In the steady state; the trajectories of single protonsand proton pairs are studied; at different values of plasma β (ratio between kinetic andmagnetic pressure). For single-particle displacements; results are consistent with fluids andmagnetic field line dynamics; where particles undergo normal diffusion for very long times;with higher β's being more diffusive. In an intermediate time range; with separations lying inthe inertial range; particles experience an explosive dispersion in time; consistent with theRichardson prediction. These results; obtained for the first time with a self-consistent kineticmodel; are relevant for astrophysical and laboratory plasmas; where turbulence is crucial forheating; mixing; and acceleration processes.,Physical review letters,2016,4
Analysis of cancellation exponents in two-dimensional Vlasov turbulence,G De Vita; L Sorriso-Valvo; F Valentini; S Servidio; L Primavera; V Carbone; P Veltri,Statistical properties of plasma turbulence are investigated by means of two-dimensionalVlasov simulations. In particular; a classical technique called signed measure is used tocharacterize the scaling behavior and the topology of sign-oscillating structures insimulations of the hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell model. Exploring different turbulence regimes;varying both the plasma β and the level of fluctuations; it is observed that Vlasov turbulencemanifests two ranges with different exponents; the transition being observed near the ionskin depth. These results; which may have applications to both laboratory and astrophysicalsystems; further confirm the singular nature of small scale fluctuations in a plasma; mainlyclassified as intermittent; narrow; and intense current sheets.,Physics of Plasmas,2014,4
Orszag Tang vortex—Kinetic study of a turbulent plasma,TN Parashar; S Servidio; MA Shay; WH Matthaeus; PA Cassak,Kinetic evolution of the Orszag‐Tang vortex is studied using collisionless hybrid simulationsbased on particle in cell ions and fluid electrons. In magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) thisconfiguration leads rapidly to broadband turbulence. An earlier study [1] estimated thedissipation in the system. A comparison of MHD & hybrid simulations showed similarbehavior at large scales but substantial differences at small scales. The hybrid magneticenergy spectrum shows a break at the scale where Hall term in the Ohm's law becomesimportant. The protons heat perpendicularly and most of the energy is dissipated throughmagnetic interactions. Here; the space time structure of the system is studied usingfrequency‐wavenumber (k‐ω) decomposition. No clear resonances appear; ruling out thecyclotron resonances as a likely candidate for the perpendicular heating. The only …,AIP Conference Proceedings,2010,4
Turbulence laws in natural bed flows,Domenico Ferraro; Sergio Servidio; Vincenzo Carbone; Subhasish Dey; Roberto Gaudio,Abstract Characterization of turbulence in natural bed streams is one of the most fascinatingproblems of fluid dynamics. In this study; a statistical description of turbulence in a naturalpebble bed flow is presented applying the laws of turbulence. A laboratory experiment wasconducted to measure the three-dimensional instantaneous velocity components in a flowover heterogeneous coarse sediments that simulated a natural bed. The analysis revealsthat the spectra (in Fourier space) show a power-law scaling; $ E (k)\sim k^{{\it\alpha}} $;suggesting the presence of inertial range turbulence. The exponent ${\it\alpha} $ is slightlyshallower than the Kolmogorov $5/3$ scaling law; with this deviation possibly due to the bedroughness heterogeneity and to fluctuation anisotropy. The Taylor frozen-in approximation isbroken at smaller scales towards the roughness crest level; therefore; a new statistical …,Journal of Fluid Mechanics,2016,3

Pezzi etal.[Astrophys. J. 834; 166 (2017)] is here extended by analyzing the features of theturbulence produced by the interaction of two colliding Alfvénic wave packets in a kineticplasma. Although the approach based on the presence of linear modes features is stillhelpful in characterizing some low-energy fluctuations; other signatures; which go beyondthe pure linear modes analysis; are recovered; such as the significant weakening of cleardispersion relations and the production of zero frequency fluctuations.,Physical Review E,2017,2

As commonly observed in space plasmas; magnetic reconnection ischaracterized by the presence of turbulence. Here we provide a direct comparison of oursimulations with reported observations of reconnection events in the magnetotail;investigating the properties of the electromagnetic field and the energy conversionmechanisms.

Electrostatic analyzer design for solar wind proton measurements with high temporal; energy; and angular resolutions,Antoine Cara; Benoit Lavraud; Andrei Fedorov; Johan De Keyser; Rossana DeMarco; M Federica Marcucci; Francesco Valentini; Sergio Servidio; Roberto Bruno,Abstract We present the design study of an electrostatic analyzer that permits combined hightemporal; energy; and angular resolution measurements of solar wind ions. Therequirements for high temporal; energy; and angular resolutions; combined with the need forsufficient counting statistics; lead to an electrostatic analyzer with large radius (140 mm) andlarge geometric factor. The resulting high count rates require the use of channel electronmultipliers (CEMs); instead of microchannel plates; to avoid saturation. The large radiusfurther permits the placement of 32 CEM detectors at the analyzer focal plane; therebyproviding very high angular resolution in azimuth (1.5). Electrostatic simulations wereperformed to define the analyzer geometric factor; energy resolution; analyzer constant (K);elevation response; etc. Simulations were also performed to define the geometry of the …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2017,2
Cancellation analysis of current density in solar active region NOAA10019,Gaetano De Vita; Antonio Vecchio; Luca Sorriso-Valvo; Carine Briand; Leonardo Primavera; Sergio Servidio; Fabio Lepreti; Vincenzo Carbone,Solar flares are often associated with changes in the fine magnetic structure of the emittingactive region. Such topological modification results in variations of both the scalingproperties of the fields' fluctuations; and the fractal dimension of the associated gradients.The use of cancellation analysis of the current density has been attempted for theidentification and quantitative estimation of such changes.

Properties of magnetic reconnection in MHD turbulence,S Servidio; MA Shay; WH Matthaeus; P Dmitruk; PA Cassak; M Wan,Numerical simulations of two‐dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic (2D MHD) turbulencereveal the presence of a huge number of sites where magnetic reconnection locally occurs.The properties of this ensemble of reconnection events; that are spontaneously generatedby turbulence; have been studied. The associated reconnection rates; computed as theelectric field at the neutral points; are broadly distributed and the statistics of these eventsare presented.

The third‐order law for magnetohydrodynamic turbulence with constant shear,Minping Wan; Sean Oughton; Sergio Servidio; William H Matthaeus,The scaling laws of mixed third‐order structure functions for isotropic; homogeneous; andincompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence have been recently applied insolar wind studies; even though there is recognition that isotropy is not well satisfied.

Statistical properties of solar wind discontinuities; intermittent turbulence; and rapid emergence of non‐Gaussian distributions,A Greco; William H Matthaeus; Sergio Servidio; Pablo Dmitruk; Minping Wan; Sean Oughton; P Chuychai,Recent studies have compared properties of the magnetic field in simulations of Hall MHDturbulence with spacecraft data; focusing on methods used to identify classicaldiscontinuities and intermittency statistics. Comparison of ACE solar wind data andsimulations of 2D and 3D turbulence shows good agreement in waiting‐time analysis ofmagnetic discontinuities; and in the related distribution of magnetic field increments. Thissupports the idea that the magnetic structures in the solar wind may emerge fast and locallyfrom nonlinear dynamics that can be understood in the framework of nonlinear MHD theory.The analysis suggests that small scale current sheets form spontaneously and rapidlyenough that some of the observed solar wind discontinuities may be locally generated;representing boundaries between interacting flux tubes.,AIP Conference Proceedings,2010,2

Spatial and temporal analysis of magnetic helicity in the solar wind,R Bruno; E Pietropaolo; S Servidio; A Greco; WH Matthaeus; R D'Amicis; L Sorriso-Valvo; V Carbone; A Balogh; B Bavassano,Abstract Magnetic helicity Hm is one of the three quadratic invariants of the ideal MHDequations of motion. An important property is that it is a pseudoscalar and changes signunder coordinate inversion x-->-x. Then; Hm represents a measure of lack of mirrorsymmetry of the magnetic field or; in other words; it estimates the" knottedness" of magneticfield lines. A positive/negative Hm would indicate a right/left-hand sense of polarization. Astandard analysis of reduced Hm; based on Fourier decomposition and performed ininterplanetary space; would show that the handedness of the fluctuations in a given wavenumber is uncorrelated with the handedness of fluctuations at nearby wavenumbers. As amatter of fact; Hm would continuously fluctuate between positive and negative valuesthrought the whole frequency range. However; this kind of analysis provides only part of …,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,2008,2

Turbulent energy dissipation rate in a tilting flume with a highly rough bed,F Coscarella; S Servidio; D Ferraro; V Carbone; R Gaudio,Turbulent flows on highly rough beds; such as those occurring in natural watercourses;represent a longstanding and fascinating problem of hydraulics; motivating in the past fewdecades huge research on new models of turbulence. In this work; laboratory experimentsare presented on a stream flowing on a heterogeneous pebble bed with varying slope. Theanalysis of the flow speed puts in evidence a clear inertial range; where the Kolmogorov 4/5-law for the streamwise velocity spatial increments holds. The law is used for a systematicestimation of the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate 𝜖; here measured for threedifferent bed slopes and hence for three different shear Reynolds numbers. The experimentspresented here suggest that small scale turbulence has properties similar to the classicalpicture of homogeneous universal turbulence invoked by the Kolmogorov theory.,Physics of Fluids,2017,1
Magnetosperic Multiscale (MMS) observation of plasma velocity-space cascade: Hermite representation and theory,S Servidio; A Chasapis; WH Matthaeus; D Perrone; F Valentini; TN Parashar; P Veltri; D Gershman; CT Russell; B Giles; SA Fuselier; TD Phan; J Burch,Abstract: Plasma turbulence is investigated using high-resolution ion velocity distributionsmeasured by the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS) in the Earth's magnetosheath.The particle distribution is highly structured; suggesting a cascade-like process in velocityspace. This complex velocity space structure is investigated using a three-dimensionalHermite transform that reveals a power law distribution of moments. In analogy tohydrodynamics; a Kolmogorov approach leads directly to a range of predictions for thisphase-space cascade.

Coronal Heating Topology: The Interplay of Current Sheets and Magnetic Field Lines,AF Rappazzo; WH Matthaeus; D Ruffolo; M Velli; S Servidio,Abstract The magnetic topology and field line random walk (FLRW) properties of a nanoflare-heated and magnetically confined corona are investigated in the reducedmagnetohydrodynamic regime. Field lines originating from current sheets form coherentstructures; called current sheet connected (CSC) regions; which extend around them. CSCFLRW is strongly anisotropic; with preferential diffusion along the current sheets' in-planelength. CSC FLRW properties remain similar to those of the entire ensemble but exhibitenhanced mean square displacements and separations due to the stronger magnetic fieldintensities in CSC regions. The implications for particle acceleration and heat transport inthe solar corona and wind; and for solar moss formation are discussed.,The Astrophysical Journal,2017,1
Non-universality of three-dimensional turbulence in PIC simulations,Vyacheslav Olshevsky; Sergio Servidio; Leonardo Primavera; Wei Jiang; Giovanni Lapenta,Abstract We perform kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of Taylor-Green vortex with differentinitial magnetic field distributions. The evolution starts abruptly; and the system releases asubstantial part of the magnetic field energy in a few ion gyration times. In this phase theinitial pressure imbalance is compensated; and the system obtains its characteristic energyspectrum. After this phase a rather stationary dissipation of magnetic field energy andheating of plasma particles is observed. We find distinct discrepancies in the evolution andenergy spectra of different magnetic configurations; despite the same initial global MHDinvariants. Kinetic plasma processes that take place at scales smaller than ion inertial lengthmay explain the non-universality of turbulence observed in the solar wind.,EGU General Assembly Conference Abstracts,2016,1
Overview on numerical studies of reconnection and dissipation in the solar wind,S Donato; S Servidio; P Dmitruk; F Valentini; A Greco; P Veltri; M Wan; MA Shay; PA Cassak; WH Matthaeus,In this work; recent advances in numerical studies of local reconnection events in theturbulent plasmas are reviewed. Recently [1]; the nonlinear dynamics of magneticreconnection in turbulence has been investigated through high resolution numericalsimulations. Both fluid (MHD and Hall MHD) and kinetic (HybridVlasov) 2D simulationsreveal the presence of a large number of X-type neutral points; where magneticreconnection locally occurs. The associated reconnection rates are distributed over a widerange of values and they depend on the local geometry of the diffusion region. This newapproach to the study of magnetic reconnection has broad applications to the turbulent solarwind (SW).

MHD relaxation; intermittency and the origin of discontinuities in the solar wind,W Matthaeus; S Servidio; A Greco; P Chuychai; P Dmitruk,Abstract Simulations of MHD turbulence show that several types of fast; local relaxationprocesses operate robustly. These include production of correlations associated with force-free states; Alfvenic states; and Beltrami flows. In MHD; all principle nonlinearities-Lorentzforce; advection; magnetic induction; and the correlations among these--are weakened byfast relaxation. This occurs in spatial patches bounded by near-discontinuities; and can bedescribed by a local adaptation of global relaxation principles. Non-Gaussian statistics areimplied; thus providing a natural real-space explanation of the origin of intermittency. Giventhe many indications that turbulence is active in the solar wind; one might also inquire as towhether the numerous discontinuities observed are related to intermittency generated byturbulence.

Nonlinear waves and instabilities leading to secondary reconnection in reconnection outflows,Giovanni Lapenta; Francesco Pucci; Vyacheslav Olshevsky; Sergio Servidio; Luca Sorriso-Valvo; David L Newman; Martin V Goldman,Abstract Reconnection outflows have been under intense recent scrutiny; from in situobservations and from simulations. These regions are host to a variety of instabilities andintense energy exchanges; often even superior to the main reconnection site. We reporthere a number of results drawn from an investigation of simulations. First; the outflows areobserved to become unstable to drift instabilities. Second; these instabilities lead to theformation of secondary reconnection sites. Third; the secondary processes are responsiblefor large energy exchanges and particle energization. Finally; the particle distributionfunction are modified to become non-Maxwellian and include multiple interpenetratingpopulations.,Journal of Plasma Physics,2018,*
Dissipation in weakly-collisional turbulent plasmas,Oreste Pezzi; Denise Perrone; Sergio Servidio; Francesco Valentini; Luca Sorriso-Valvo; Pierluigi Veltri,Comprehending the mechanisms of heating and energy dissipation in the solar windrepresents one of the longstanding problem for the space plasma community. Indeed; in-situobservations indicate that the cooling of the expanding solar wind is less efficient thanexpected for an adiabatic expanding gas. Hence; to keep the solar wind hot; a local sourceof heating must play a role in converting the energy into heat. Several collisionlessmechanisms have been proposed to explain the energy dissipation [1]; however theseprocesses; which do not take into account collisions; lacks the final part of the heatingprocess description; related to the irreversible degradation of information. In the solar windcollisions are considered far too weak to produce significant effects on plasma behavior.However; the presence of strong out-of-equilibrium phase space structures; whose …,*,2018,*

Coherent Structure Formation through nonlinear interactions in 2D Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence,Elisa De Giorgio; Sergio Servidio; Pierluigi Veltri,Abstract Using high resolution 2D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations we analyze theformation of coherent structures induced by nonlinear interactions in turbulent flows. Theproperties of these coherent structures; which at the smallest scales are identified through aspatial intermittent behavior; turn out to be guided by the conservation of ideal quadratic(rugged) invariants of the 2D incompressible MHD equations. Different spatial regions canbe identified; where the correlations predicted using the variational principles associated tothe rugged invariants are locally displayed. These local correlated structures are producedrapidly; as soon as the turbulence is fully developed. It is worth speculating that the smallscale structures under our investigation could give rise to singular weak solutions whenletting the dissipative coefficients go to zero.

Two proton plasma beta regimes are explored: beta p= 1 andbeta p= 0.2 (beta is the ratio between thermal and magnetic pressures). At beta p= 1; themagnetic energy spectum exhibit k⊥-8/3 and k||-7/2 power laws; while they are slightlysteeper for beta p= 0.2. Nevertheless; both regimes develop a spectral anisotropy consistentwith k|| k⊥ 2/3 at k⊥ rho p> 1; and small-scale intermittency (the beta p= 0.2 case beingslightly more intermittent than the beta p= 1 counterpart).

Magnetic Reconnection during Turbulence: Statistics of X-Lines and Heating,Colby Haggerty; Michael Shay; Tulasi Parashar; William Matthaeus; Yan Yang; Minping Wan; Sergio Servidio; Pin Wu,Abstract Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous plasma phenomenon that has beenobserved in turbulent plasma systems. It is an important part of the turbulent dynamics andheating of space; laboratory and astrophysical plasmas. Recent simulation andobservational studies have detailed how magnetic reconnection heats plasma and this workhas developed to the point where it can be applied to larger and more complex plasmasystems. We examine the statistics of magnetic reconnection in fully kinetic PIC simulationsto quantify the role of magnetic reconnection on energy dissipation and plasma heating.

Numerical study of the transition to kinetic turbulence induced by large-amplitude Kinetic Alfvén fluctuations,Christian L Vasconez; Francesco Valentini; Oreste Pezzi; Sergio Servidio; Francesco Malara; Francesco Pucci,Abstract Space plasmas are dominated by the presence of large-amplitude waves; large-scale inhomogeneities; and turbulence. When perturbations superpose to aninhomogeneous background magnetic field the generation of small scale fluctuations cantake place also in more realistic configurations. For instance; when an Alfvén wavepropagates in a medium where the Alfvén speed varies in a direction transverse to the meanfield; it undergoes phase-mixing; which progressively bends wavefronts; generating smallscales in the transverse direction. As soon as transverse scales get of the order of the protoninertial length d_p; kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs) are naturally generated.

In particular Moffatt [1] and Parker [2]showed that; in the framework of the incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD);nonlinear interactions can develop only during the overlapping of the two packets. Here wedescribe a similar problem in the framework of the kinetic physics. The collision of two quasi-Alfvénic packets has been analyzed by means of MHD; Hall-MHD and kinetic simulationsperformed with two different hybrid codes: a PIC code [3] and a Vlasov-Maxwell code [4].Due to the huge computational cost; only a 2D-3V phase space is allowed (two dimensionsin the physical space; three dimensions in the velocity space).

Random Interchange of Magnetic Connectivity,WH Matthaeus; DJ Ruffolo; S Servidio; M Wan; AF Rappazzo,Abstract Magnetic connectivity; the connection between two points along a magnetic fieldline; has a stochastic character associated with field lines random walking in space due tomagnetic fluctuations; but connectivity can also change in time due to dynamical activity [1].For fluctuations transverse to a strong mean field; this connectivity change be caused bystochastic interchange due to component reconnection. The process may be understoodapproximately by formulating a diffusion-like Fokker-Planck coefficient [2] that isasymptotically related to standard field line random walk. Quantitative estimates areprovided; for transverse magnetic field models and anisotropic models such as reducedmagnetohydrodynamics. In heliospheric applications; these estimates may be useful forunderstanding mixing between open and close field line regions near coronal hole …,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,2015,*
Hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell simulations of phase mixing as a mechanism to produce kinetic Alfvén waves,Christian Vasconez; Francesco Valentini; Francesco Malara; Sergio Servidio; Francesco Pucci; Pierluigi Veltri,Abstract In the range of proton kinetic scales and even down to typical electron kineticscales; many solar-wind observational analyses; theoretical works and numericalsimulations suggest that the so-called kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs) can play an importantrole in the mechanisms of turbulent energy dissipation and heating. Mathematically; KAWsare a wave solution of the two-fluid dispersion relation; in propagation quasi-perpendicularto a background magnetic field. They can be considered as the continuation of themagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Alfvén mode at scales comparable to the ion skin depth;and/or the ion Larmour radius. Recently; kinetic numerical simulations of these kind ofwaves in solar-wind environment conditions suggested that resonant protons can betrapped by a pseudo-potential (Vásconez et al.; 2014); resembling the process of particle …,EGU General Assembly Conference Abstracts,2015,*

Magnetic reconnection and kinetic effects in Vlasov turbulence,Sergio Servidio,Abstract The process of magnetic reconnection is ubiquitous in nature; being typical of largescale magnetic configurations. Recently [1]; reconnection has been observed to emergelocally and intermittently in plasmas; being a crucial element of turbulence itself. Systematicanalysis of MHD simulations reveals the presence of a large number of X-type neutralpoints; where magnetic reconnection occurs. More recently; the same phenomenon hasbeen inspected within plasma models [2]. The link between magnetic reconnection andkinetic effects in the turbulent solar-wind has been investigated by means of multi-dimensional simulations of the hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell (HVM) code [3]; using 5D (2D inspace and 3D in velocity space) and full 6D simulations of plasma turbulence.

Interchange Reconnection and Slow Solar Wind Formation at the boundaries of open field regions in the Solar Corona,AF Rappazzo; WH Matthaeus; DJ Ruffolo; S Servidio; M Velli,Abstract Interchange reconnection; ie; magnetic reconnection at the interface between openand closed corona; is thought to contribute to the formation of the slowsolar wind; since itcan inject the hotter and denserplasma from closed regions into the heliosphere; andaccount for the different slow wind composition (thatis similar to the plasma of closedregions) respectto the fast wind. The interchange process has mostly been investigatedformagnetic field lines with opposite polarity and null points; either for the case ofcounterdirected loops (eg; Fisk et al. 1999; Fisk and Schwadron 2001); or incorrespondence of null points at the apex of streamers or pseudo-streamers (eg; Wang et al.1998; Edmondson et al. 2010; Del Zanna et al. 2011).

Vlasov Plasma Turbulence in the Solar Wind at Proton Kinetic Scales,F Valentini; S Servidio; WH Matthaeus; K Osman; D Perrone; F Califano; P Veltri,Abstract Solar-wind heating through turbulent dissipation at kinetic wavelengths representsone of the most studied and challenging problems in the field of space plasma physics. Inthis work; kinetic effects in the turbulent solar-wind plasma are investigated by means ofmulti-dimensional simulations of the hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell (HVM) model [1]. Using 5D (2Din space and 3D in velocity space) and full 6D simulations of plasma turbulence; it is foundthat kinetic effects manifest through the deformation of the proton distribution function (DF);with patterns of non-Maxwellian features being concentrated near regions of strongmagnetic gradients.

In the solar wind; reconnection events andcurrent sheets are found for the first time to be concentrated in intervals of intermittentturbulence: within the most non-Gaussian 1% of magnetic field fluctuations; 87-92% ofreconnection exhausts and about 9% of current sheets are found. Also; the likelihood that anidentified current sheet will also correspond to a reconnection exhaust increasesdramatically as the least intermittent fluctuations are removed. Hence; the turbulent solarwind contains a hierarchy of intermittent magnetic field structures that are increasingly linkedto current sheets; which in turn are progressively more likely to correspond to sites of …,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,2014,*

These display signatures of intermittency in the form of rare large amplitudefluctuations that produce highly non-Gaussian heavy tailed probability distribution functions;and have properties consistent with dynamical generation by strong plasma turbulence.Therefore; coherent structures embedded in the solar wind should reflect the nonlineardynamics that give rise to intermittency; such as random magnetic reconnection betweenadjoining flux tubes.

Analytic Theory and Numerical Study of the Magnetic Field Line Random Walk in Reduced Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence,DJ Ruffolo; AP Snodin; S Oughton; S Servidio; WH Matthaeus,Abstract The random walk of magnetic field lines is examined analytically and numerically inthe context of reduced magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) turbulence; which provides a usefuldescription of plasmas dominated by a strong mean field; such as in the solar corona. Anonperturbative theory of magnetic field line diffusion [1] is compared with the diffusioncoefficients obtained by accurate numerical tracing of magnetic field lines for both syntheticmodels and direct numerical simulations of RMHD. Statistical analysis of an ensemble oftrajectories confirms the applicability of the theory; which very closely matches the numericalfield line diffusion coefficient as a function of distance z along the mean magnetic field for awide range of the Kubo number R.

Generation of ion temperature anisotropy in kinetic hybrid-Vlasov simulations,D Perrone; F Valentini; S Servidio; S Dalena; P Veltri,Abstract The interplanetary medium is a multi-component and weakly collisional systemgenerally observed to be in a fully turbulent regime [1; 2]. The system dynamics at shortspatial scales appears to be dominated by kinetic effects that drive the interstellar gas farfrom the configuration of thermodynamic equilibrium [3-5]. We present a numerical analysisof a turbulent plasma composed of kinetic ions (protons and alpha particles) and fluidelectrons in the typical conditions of the solar-wind environment; developed by using a low-noise hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell code [6; 7] in a five dimensional phase space configuration(two dimensions in physical space and three dimensions in velocity space)[8].

Magnetic Reconnection and Intermittent Turbulence in the Solar Wind,S Servidio; K Osman; WH Matthaeus; JT Gosling; A Greco; B Hnat; SC Chapman; T Phan,Abstract A statistical relationship between magnetic reconnection; current sheets andintermittent turbulence is reported for the first time using in-situ solar wind measurementsfrom the Wind spacecraft at 1 AU. We find Petschek-like reconnection exhausts and currentssheets are concentrated in spatially inhomogeneous rare large amplitude fluctuations; suchthat 87-92% and 9-10% respectively are located within the most intermittent 1% of turbulentfluctuations. While most current sheets do not appear to be undergoing reconnection; themost intermittent have an increased likelihood of being reconnection sites. Hence; there isevidence for a hierarchy of intermittent structures that are increasingly linked to currentsheets; which in turn are ever more associated with magnetic reconnection. These resultscould have far reaching implications for non-uniform dissipation in all turbulent plasmas.,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,2013,*
Spatial Transport of Magnetic Flux Surfaces in Strongly Anisotropic Turbulence,WH Matthaeus; S Servidio; M Wan; DJ Ruffolo; AF Rappazzo; S Oughton,Abstract Magnetic flux surfaces afford familiar descriptions of spatial structure; dynamics;and connectivity of magnetic fields; with particular relevance in contexts such as solarcoronal flux tubes; magnetic field connectivity in the interplanetary and interstellar medium;as well as in laboratory plasmas and dynamo problems [1-4]. Typical models assume thatfield-lines are orderly; and flux tubes remain identifiable over macroscopic distances;however; a previous study has shown that flux tubes shred in the presence of fluctuations;typically losing identity after several correlation scales [5].

Solar Wind Fluctuations and the von Kármán–Howarth Equations: The role of fourth-order correlations,Sean Oughton; Minping Wan; William H Matthaeus; Sergio Servidio,The von Kármán-Howarth (vKH) hierarchy of equations relate the second-order correlationsof the turbulent fluctuations to the third-order ones; the third-order to the fourth-order; and soon. We recently demonstrated [1] that for MHD; self-similar solutions to the vKH equationsseem to require at least two independent similarity lengthscales (one for each Elsässerenergy); so that compared to hydrodynamics a richer set of behaviors seems likely to ensue.Moreover; despite the well-known anisotropy of MHD turbulence with a mean magnetic field(B 0); the equation for the second-order correlation does not contain explicit dependence onB 0. We show that there is; however; implicit dependence on B 0 via the third-ordercorrelations; which themselves have both explicit B 0-dependence and also their ownimplicit dependence through fourth-order correlations.

Magnetic flux surfaces in anisotropic three dimensional complex fields,S Servidio; WH Matthaeus; P Dmitruk; F Rappazzo; V Carbone; S Oughton; M Wan; DJ Ruffolo,Abstract In a turbulent state (or even in a slightly turbulent system); in contrast to a highlysymmetric and well-behaved field configurations; magnetic field lines may become"ergodic"; and eventually wander to infinity. Smooth and linear configurations may be veryunrealistic in nature; since turbulence affects most of the astrophysical plasmas; and sosimple pictures of the structure of the magnetic field may become inaccurate. The actualtopology of the magnetic field can be described in terms of magnetic surfaces. We present astudy of the topological aspects of magnetic surfaces in a simplified model ofmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD); studying fields coming from both synthetic (Gaussian)construction and from direct numerical simulations of Reduced MHD (RMHD).

Local kinetic effects in a turbulent plasma: numerical simulations,S Servidio; F Valentini; F Califano; P Veltri,Abstract The heating of the solar corona in magnetic loops involves fundamental processesthat influence the origin and dynamics of the solar wind. The explosive releases of energythat heat the turbulent corona may be the result of local reconnection events. Studying theseprocesses with self consistent kinetic models; in a fully turbulent regime; is today a challengefor scientists. Using direct numerical simulations of a hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell model; kineticprocesses are investigated in a two-dimensional turbulent plasma; embedded in a strongmagnetic field. In turbulence; kinetic effects manifest through a deformation of the iondistribution function. These patterns of non-Maxwellian features are concentrated in spacenearby regions of strong magnetic activity: the distribution function is modulated by themagnetic topology; and can elongate along or across the local magnetic field [1].

Local anisotropy and power spectra in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence,WH Matthaeus; S Servidio; P Dmitruk; V Carbone; S Oughton; M Wan; KT Osman,Abstract Correlation and spectral anisotropy play important roles in solar wind andastrophysical plasmas; having significant impact on descriptions of the turbulence cascade;particle scattering; the nature of kinetic dissipation; and the transport of turbulence.Anisotropy emerges dynamically in MHD; producing stronger gradients across the large-scale mean magnetic field than along it; and occurring both globally and locally. Recently;properties of correlation anisotropy have been investigated through numerical simulations;showing the effect is intensified for more localized estimates of the mean magnetic field. Themathematical formulation of this property shows that local anisotropy mixes second-orderwith higher order correlations [1].

One of the key aspects for a deep understanding of thesephenomena is the plasma behaviour at small scales. This chapter is intended as adiscussion forum on the role played by small scales in solar wind plasma dynamics and/orevolution. Processes occurring at large scales are anyhow responsible for the generation ofsmall scale kinetic fluctuations and structures that in turn have important feedback on theglobal system evolution. In particular; we will focus our attention on two topics; namelymagnetic reconnection and kinetic effects at short spatial scales.

The analysis confirm that the Hall term plays animportant role in turbulence; where magnetic islands simultaneously reconnect in a complexway. In particular; increase of the Hall parameter; the ratio between the ion skin depth andthe system size; causes the distribution of reconnection rates to become broader than in theMHD case; and increases the frequency of occurrence of the highest values of reconnectionrate.

Nonlinearity; structure; and the role of higher order statistics: What kind of universality can be expected in MHD and plasma turbulence?,WH Matthaeus; M Wan; K Osman; S Servidio; S Oughton; P Dmitruk; A Greco,Abstract``Universality''in hydrodynamic turbulence usually refers to the existence of uniquestatistical distributions that are obtained as the Reynolds number tends to infinity.

By comparing ideal simulations with well-resolved dissipativesimulations with identical initial conditions; non-Gaussianity and characteristic coherentstructures are found to initiate almost identically in the two systems. The results suggests thatgeneration of coherent structures and breaking of self-similarity are essentially idealprocesses; with dissipation acting only to limit growth of the smallest scale structures.

Comparison of solar wind data and simulations of2D and 3D turbulence shows good agreement in waiting-time analysis of magneticdiscontinuities; and in the related distribution of magnetic field increments.

The shape of the bottleneck effect indicates thatMHD energy cascade is less local than hydro cascade.

Comparison of ACE solar wind data andsimulations of 2D and 3D turbulence shows good agreement in waiting-time analysis ofmagnetic discontinuities; and in the related distribution of magnetic field increments. Thediscontinuities are not distributed without correlations; but rather they show non-Poissoncorrelations; possibly in the form of burstiness or voids; present in the data at least up to thetypical correlation scale. A similar conclusion emerges from Poisson analysis of thesimulation dataset. Our tentative conclusion is that Poisson's random noise might wellcharacterize the very large scale solar wind fluctuations.

Scaling properties of two-dimensional turbulence in a pure electron plasma,F Lepreti; M Romé; R Pozzoli; V Carbone; G Maero; S Servidio; F Valentini,Highly magnetized pure electron plasmas in Malmberg-Penning traps [1] provide theopportunity to experimentally investigate two-dimensional (2D) fluid turbulence. In fact;under suitable experimental conditions; the transverse dynamics of the electron plasmacolumn is well described by the drift-Poisson equations [2]; which are isomorphic to the 2DEuler equations for an incompressible; inviscid fluid; whose vorticity corresponds; up to aconstant of proportionality; to the electron plasma density. In recent years; the scalingproperties and dynamics of 2D turbulence in electron plasmas have been investigated bothby Fourier transform [3] and wavelet analysis [4; 5]. In this work the scaling and statisticalproperties of freely decaying 2D turbulence in a pure electron plasma confined in aMalmberg-Penning trap are studied experimentally.

The role of magnetic field in solar wind turbulent cascade,L Sorriso-Valvo; R Marino; S Servidio; R Bruno; A Noullez; V Carbone,Abstract The Yaglom law for the mixt third order moment of the Elsasser fields fluctuationshas been recently observed in the solar wind. This observation confirm the existence of aMHD turbulent cascade in the interplanetary plasma; in both ecliptic and polar wind. In thepolar wind measured by Ulysses spacecraft; the cascade occasionally holds up to scales ofdays. The nature of such cascade; and in particular the role of magnetic field at large scales;are discussed. The different possible scenaries show that solar wind turbulent cascade isnot universal.,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,2009,*
Experimental tests of the von Karman self-preservation hypothesis: decay of an electron plasma to a near-maximum entropy state,D Rodgers; S Servidio; WH Matthaeus; D Montgomery; T Mitchell; T Aziz,Abstract The self-preservation hypothesis of von Karman [1] implies that in threedimensiolnal turbulence the energy E decays as dE/dt=-a Z^ 3/L; where a is a constant; Z isthe turbulence amplitude and L is a simlarity length scale. Extensions of this idea to MHD [2]has been of great utility in solar wind and coronal heating studies. Here we conduct anexperimental study of this idea in the context of two dimensional electron plasma turbulence.In particular; we examine the time evolution that leads to dynamical relaxation of a pureelectron plasma in a Malmberg-Penning (MP) trap; comparing experiments and statisticaltheories of weakly dissipative two-dimensional (2D) turbulence [3]. A formulation of vonKarman-Howarth (vKH) self-preserving decay is presented for a 2D positive-vorticity fluid; asystem that corresponds closely to a 2D electron ExB drift plasma.

Generation of non-Gaussian statistics and coherent structures in ideal magnetohydrodynamics,WH Matthaeus; M Wan; S Servidio; S Oughton,Abstract The emergence of small-scale coherent structures is a well-known feature ofturbulence; which is usually associated with inertial range signatures of nonuniformdissipation; and the associated emergence of non-Gaussian statistics. In steady-state thesestructures cause departures from self-similarity and the phenomenon of intermittency.Spectral method simulations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) are used to investigateproduction of coherent small-scale structures in two-dimensional MHD. The near-identicalgrowth of non-Gaussianity in ideal and nonideal cases suggests that generation of coherentstructures and breaking of self-similarity are essentially ideal processes. This has importantimplications for understanding the origin of intermittency in turbulence. In particular; solarwind turbulence is estimated to be old enough that at least some nonGaussian features …,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,2009,*
Wavenumber-Frequency structure of 2D Kinetic Plasma Turbulence,TN Parashar; MA Shay; S Servidio; WH Matthaeus; B Breech,Abstract The question of dissipation in turbulent collisionless plasmas is of key importance inthe context of solar corona; solar wind and other astrophysical systems. Strong wave particleinteractions are usually invoked to describe dissipation of energy in such plasmas. We lookat the structure of 2 dimensional driven turbulence; set up in a hybrid plasma code; in thewavenumber-frequency space. The energies; when plotted in k-omega space; do not showany significant wave modes present in the system. This suggests that strong wave particleresonances may not be necessary to dissipate energy in turbulent plasmas. System sizedependence of the problem as well as some possible dissipation mechanisms will bediscussed.,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,2009,*
Statistical Properties of Magnetic Reconnection in MHD turbulence,Sergio Servidio; William Matthaeus; Paul Cassak; Michael Shay; Pablo Dmitruk,Abstract Magnetic reconnection is an integral part of MHD turbulence [1] in that thefragmentation of magnetic eddies into smaller structures necessarily involves change ofmagnetic topology. To better understand this relationship; recently the properties ofthousands of magnetic reconnection events in moderate Reynolds number MHD turbulencehave been studied [1] using 2D spectral method simulations of compressible andincompressible MHD. Reconnection between magnetic islands; different in size and energy;occurs locally and sporadically in time. The associated reconnection rates are distributedover a wide range of values and scale with the geometry of the diffusion region. Matchingclassical turbulence analysis with the Sweet-Parker theory; the main statistical features ofthese multi-scale reconnection events are identified.

Characterization of Meta-Stable Equilibria of a Electron Plasma: Relaxation Towards Minimum Enstrophy and Maximum Entropy States,Douglas Rodgers; Sergio Servidio; William Matthaeus; David Montgomery; Travis Mitchell,Abstract Dynamical relaxation of a pure electron plasma in a Malmberg-Penning trap isstudied; comparing experiments and statistical theories of weakly dissipative two-dimensional turbulence [1]. Statistical analysis of many experimental runs favors atheoretical picture of relaxation to a near-maximum entropy state with constrained energy;circulation and angular momentum; rather than to a minimum enstrophy state [2]. However itis possible to vary experimental parameters continuously so that the results move from near-equal accord with the two theories to more strongly favoring maximum entropy. One way toaccomplish this is to vary the initial distribution so that more complex electron patches areproduced; this generally appears to increase the level of turbulent activity; favoringmaximum entropy over minimum enstrophy.

Self-Similar Decay of Enstrophy in an Electron Plasma,Douglas Rodgers; Sergio Servidio; William Matthaeus; Travis Mitchell,Abstract The similarity solution for energy decay in 3D hydrodynamic turbulence; due toTaylor and von Karman [1]; based on the self preservation hypothesis for the shape of thetwo point correlation; implies that the energy E decays as dE/dt=-a Z^ 3/L; where a is aconstant; Z is the turbulence amplitude and L is a similarity length scale. Extensions of thisidea to MHD [2] have been of great utility in solar wind and coronal heating studies. Whilethe hydrodynamic case is well studied experimentally; we are not aware that similarity decayhas been examined in a laboratory plasma. Here we conduct an experimental study of thisidea in the context of two dimensional electron plasma turbulence. Specifically; we proposean expression for the decay of enstrophy of a single-signed-vorticity fluid which is analogousto the von Karman decay of energy in 3D turbulence; and compare this to the dynamical …,APS Meeting Abstracts,2009,*

Nonlinear dynamics of two-dimensional electron plasma,WH Matthaeus; S Servidio; D Rodgers; DC Montgomery; T Mitchell; T Aziz,Abstract The turbulent relaxation of a magnetized two dimensional (2D) electron plasmaexperiment has been investigated. The nonlinear dynamics of this kind of plasma can beapproximated in leading order as a 2D guiding center fluid; which behaves in completeanalogy to the 2D Euler equations. Departures form this analogy include dissipative andthree dimensional effects. Here we examine the characteristics of the experimental data andcompare these to solutions of 2D dissipative Navier Stokes equations. We find; perhapsremarkably; that the two systems show similar time histories; including increase of entropyand decrease of the ratio of enstrophy-to-energy. Attempts to re-examine the theories ofselective decay and maximum entropy are reviewed; including difficulties that are peculiar tothe one species case.

Intermittent structures and magnetic discontinuities in MHD turbulence and solar wind,A Greco; WH Matthaeus; S Servidio; P Chuychai; P Dmitruk,Abstract In this work we re-examined the statistics of rapid spatial variations of the magneticfield in simulations of Hall magnetohydrodynamic (HMHD) turbulence; using analysis ofintermittency properties of the turbulence; and also using methods often employed to identifydiscontinuities in the solar wind (as in the earlier work of Tsurutani&Smith 1979). Thehypothesis is that the statistics of intermittent events might be related to the statistics ofclassical MHD discontinuities. Indeed; those methods give similar distributions of events;often identifying the same structures. This suggests that observed discontinuities might notbe static solutions to the MHD equations; but instead may be related to flux tube boundariesand intermittent structures that appear spontaneously in MHD turbulence. Then; we furtherexamine the link between intermittency and MHD discontinuities; directly comparing …,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,2008,*

The inertial range of MHD turbulence and Hall MHD turbulence in solar wind,V Carbone; L Sorriso-Valvo; S Servidio; O Alexandrova; R Marino; A Noullez,Abstract Turbulent fluctuations within solar wind spectrum follows nearly Kolmogorov'spower law spectrum below the ion cyclotron frequency fci. Above this frequency; theobserved steeper power law is believed to be a'dissipative range'of the solar windturbulence. The inertial range is studied here in terms of the pseudo-energy flux; which canbe shown to have a linear scaling law in isotropic; homogeneous; fully developedturbulence. Such linear scaling has recently been observed in polar wind measured byUlysses; and represent a strong evidence that a nonlinear; turbulent cascade is at work inthe solar windplasma. Moreover; we analyze magnetic field fluctuations measured onboardCluster; lasting two decades above fci. Well defined power law and a strong increase ofintermittency with frequency in this range indicates that turbulence cannot be …,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,2007,*
The Equilibrium Ensemble of Three-dimensional Hall Magnetohydrodynamics,Sergio Servidio; William Matthaeus; Vincenzo Carbone,Abstract The nonlinear dynamics of ideal and incompressible Hall Magnetohydrodynamics(HMHD) is investigated through classical Gibbs ensemble methods. The spectral structure ofthe HMHD is derived in a three dimensional periodic geometry and then compared with theMHD case. The purpose of the work is to provide a general picture of Hall MHD spectraltransfers and cascades by the assumption that it follows equilibrium statistics. In the HMHDcase the equilibrium ensemble is built on the conservation of three quadratic invariants; thatis the total energy; the magnetic helicity; and the hybrid helicity. The latter replace the crosshelicity in the one fluid case. In the HMHD equilibrium a tendency to have double cascade(inverse and direct) is observed; moreover the Alfven effect (dynamical alignment betweenvelocity and magnetic field) is broken at ion skin depth scales.

Field lines originating from current sheets form coherent structures; called currentsheet connected (CSC) regions; which extend around them. CSC FLRW is stronglyanisotropic; with preferential diffusion along the current sheets' in-plane length. CSC FLRWproperties remain similar to those of the entire ensemble but exhibit enhanced mean squaredisplacements and separations due to the stronger magnetic field intensities in CSCregions.

From large-amplitude kinetic Alfvén fluctuations to kinetic turbulence at proton scales,CL Vásconez; F Valentini; O Pezzi; S Servidio; F Malara; F Pucci,Abstract Turbulence in the solar wind has been extensively studied; both by detailedanalyses of in situ measurements and from a theoretical point of view [1]. Beside thehomogeneous turbulence; generation of small scale fluctuations can take place also in otherrealistic configurations. Recent numerical simulations of these kind of configurations haveshown that phase mixing of large-scale parallel-propagating Alfvén waves is an efficientmechanism for the production of kinetic Alfvén waves at wavelengths close to dp and at alarge propagation angle with respect to the magnetic field [2].

The complexity of current density and current helicity are studied through cancellationanalysis of their sign-singular measure; which features power-law scaling. Spectral analysisis also performed; revealing the presence of two separate scaling ranges with differentspectral index. The time evolution of parameters is discussed. Sudden changes of thecancellation exponents at the time of large flares and the presence of correlation withExtreme-Ultra-Violet and X-ray flux suggest that eruption of large flares can be linked to thesmall-scale properties of the current structures.,*,*,*
Interchange reconnection in a turbulent Corona View all abstracts by submitter,AF Rappazzo; WH Matthaeus; D Ruffolo; S Servidio; M Velli,Magnetic reconnection at the interface between coronal holes and loops; so-calledinterchange reconnection; can release the hotter; denser plasma from magnetically confinedregions into the heliosphere; contributing to the formation of the highly variable slow solarwind. The interchange process is often thought to develop at the apex of streamers orpseudo-streamers; near Y and X-type neutral points; but slow streams with loop compositionhave been recently observed along fanlike open field lines adjacent to closed regions; farfrom the apex. However; coronal heating models; with magnetic field lines shuffled byconvective motions; show that reconnection can occur continuously in unipolar magneticfield regions with no neutral points: photospheric motions induce a magnetohydrodynamicturbulent cascade in the coronal field that creates the necessary small scales; where a …,*,*,*

As the energyis injected at large scales; it is then progressively transferred to smaller scales; where kineticeffects dominate the dynamics. At these scales; complex phenomena arise; such as heating;temperature anisotropy; particle acceleration and so on.
