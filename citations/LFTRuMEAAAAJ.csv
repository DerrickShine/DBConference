F--a model of events based on the foundational ontology dolce+ DnS ultralight,Ansgar Scherp; Thomas Franz; Carsten Saathoff; Steffen Staab,Abstract The lack of a formal model of events hinders interoperability in distributed event-based systems. In this paper; we present a formal model of events; called Event-Model-F.The model is based on the foundational ontology DOLCE+ DnS Ultralight (DUL) andprovides comprehensive support to represent time and space; objects and persons; as wellas mereological; causal; and correlative relationships between events. In addition; the Event-Model-F provides a flexible means for event composition; modeling event causality andevent correlation; and representing different interpretations of the same event. The Event-Model-F is developed following the pattern-oriented approach of DUL; is modularized indifferent ontologies; and can be easily extended by domain specific ontologies.,Proceedings of the fifth international conference on Knowledge capture,2009,187
Schemex—efficient construction of a data catalogue by stream-based indexing of linked data,Mathias Konrath; Thomas Gottron; Steffen Staab; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract We present SchemEX; an approach and tool for a stream-based indexing andschema extraction of Linked Open Data (LOD) at web-scale. The schema index provided bySchemEX can be used to locate distributed data sources in the LOD cloud. It serves typicalLOD information needs such as finding sources that contain instances of one specific datatype; of a given set of data types (so-called type clusters); or of instances in type clusters thatare connected by one or more common properties (so-called equivalence classes). Theentire process of extracting the schema from triples and constructing an index is designed tohave linear runtime complexity. Thus; the schema index can be computed on-the-fly whilethe triples are crawled and provided as a stream by a linked data spider. To demonstrate theweb-scalability of our approach; we have computed a SchemEX index over the Billion …,Web Semantics: Science; Services and Agents on the World Wide Web,2012,80
SemaPlorer—interactive semantic exploration of data and media based on a federated cloud infrastructure,Simon Schenk; Carsten Saathoff; Steffen Staab; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract SemaPlorer is an easy to use application that allows end users to interactivelyexplore and visualize a very large; mixed-quality and semantically heterogeneousdistributed semantic data set in real-time. Its purpose is to acquaint oneself about a city;touristic area; or other area a user is interested in. By visualizing the data using a map;media; and different context views; SemaPlorer advances beyond simple storage andretrieval of large numbers of triples; as the interaction with the large data set is driven by theuser. SemaPlorer leverages different semantic data sources such as DBpedia; GeoNames;WordNet; and personal FOAF files. These make a significant portion of the data provided forthe Billion Triple Challenge. SemaPlorer intriguingly connects with a large Flickr data setconverted to RDF. The storage infrastructure bases on Amazon's Elastic Computing …,Web Semantics: Science; Services and Agents on the World Wide Web,2009,72
Unlocking the semantics of multimedia presentations in the web with the multimedia metadata ontology,Carsten Saathoff; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract The semantics of rich multimedia presentations in the web such as SMIL; SVG; andFlash cannot or only to a very limited extend be understood by search engines today. Thishampers the retrieval of such presentations and makes their archival and management adifficult task. Existing metadata models and metadata standards are either conceptually toonarrow; focus on a specific media type only; cannot be used and combined together; or arenot practically applicable for the semantic description of rich multimedia presentations. Inthis paper; we propose the Multimedia Metadata Ontology (M3O) for annotating rich;structured multimedia presentations. The M3O provides a generic modeling framework forrepresenting sophisticated multimedia metadata. It allows for integrating the featuresprovided by the existing metadata models and metadata standards. Our approach bases …,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,62
Designing core ontologies,Ansgar Scherp; Carsten Saathoff; Thomas Franz; Steffen Staab,Abstract One of the key factors that hinders integration of distributed; heterogeneousinformation systems is the lack of a formal basis for modeling the complex; structuredknowledge that is to be exchanged. To alleviate this situation; we present an approachbased on core ontologies. Core ontologies are characterized by a high degree ofaxiomatization and formal precision. This is achieved by basing on a foundational ontology.In addition; core ontologies should follow a pattern-oriented design approach. By this; theyare modular and extensible. Core ontologies allow for reusing the structured knowledgethey define as well as integrating existing domain knowledge. The structured knowledge ofthe core ontologies is clearly separated from the domain-specific knowledge. Such coreontologies allow for both formally conceptualize their particular fields and to be flexibly …,Applied Ontology,2011,57
Generic support for personalized mobile multimedia tourist applications,Ansgar Scherp; Susanne Boll,Abstract Mobile applications such as mobile tourist guides that provide tourists with location-based information today mostly aim to adapt the multimedia content to the different end userdevices. More and more; these applications also exploit positioning information like GPS toguide the user on the trip. What is still lacking; however; is a< i> personalization</i> of thecontent to the interests and preferences of the individual tourist and the characteristics of theused end device. However; such a personalization increases the application's complexitysince every individual alternatives have to be considered and implemented.

Semantics; content; and structure of many for the creation of personal photo albums,Susanne Boll; Philipp Sandhaus; Ansgar Scherp; Utz Westermann,Abstract Photos are often a means to remember personal events; and the creation of photoalbums is the attempt to preserve our memories in a nice book. For a long time people havebeen creating such photo albums on the basis of prints from analog photos arranged in analbum book with scissors and glue and annotated with comments and captions-a tedioustask which in these days is getting support by authoring tools and digitally mastered photobooks. Relying on the content of others such as printed travel guides; news papers; leaflets;but also friends and family the personal content often has been enriched; enhanced; andcompleted. This is the starting point of our work: with digital photography and the increasingamount of content-based and contextual metadata of personal photos we can now use thismetadata to actually support the targeted and semi-automatic inclusion of interesting …,Proceedings of the 15th ACM international conference on Multimedia,2007,45
Event based organization and access of digital photos,*,Architecture and its implementation of an event-based media management system andmethod are disclosed. A generic model for events is used for developing architecture formedia management; called Eventcentric Media Management (EMMa) system. The systemfocuses on event experiences and provides flexible functionality for media management.The system and method analyze cross-media files for features to extract atomic events andapply algorithms to cluster files including similar or related features. Thus; the EMMa systemallows unified media indexing of multiple media types; better abstraction of the real world;use of context; media processing operations to compute and store features and tags; and amore intuitive support for multiple users.

Semantic multimedia,Steffen Staab; Ansgar Scherp; Richard Arndt; Raphael Troncy; Marcin Grzegorzek; Carsten Saathoff; Simon Schenk; Lynda Hardman,Abstract Multimedia constitutes an interesting field of application for Semantic Web andSemantic Web reasoning; as the access and management of multimedia content andcontext depends strongly on the semantic descriptions of both. At the same time; multimediaresources constitute complex objects; the descriptions of which are involved and require thefoundation on sound modeling practice in order to represent findings of low-and high levelmultimedia analysis and to make them accessible via Semantic Web querying of resources.This tutorial aims to provide a red thread through these different issues and to give anoutline of where Semantic Web modeling and reasoning needs to further contribute to thearea of semantic multimedia for the fruitful interaction between these two fields of computerscience.,*,2008,34
Context-driven smart authoring of multimedia content with xSMART,Ansgar Scherp; Susanne Boll,Abstract In recent years; many highly sophisticated multimedia authoring tools have beendeveloped. Up to today; these system's integration of the targeted user context; however; islimited. With our Context-aware Smart Multimedia Authoring Tool (xSMART) we developed asemi-automatic authoring tool that integrates the targeted user context into the differentauthoring steps and exploits this context to guide the author through the content authoringprocess. The design of xSMART allows that it can be extended and customized to therequirements of a specific domain by domain-specific wizards. These wizards realize theuser interface that meets best the domain-specific requirements and effectively supports thedomain experts in creating their content targeted at a specific user context.,Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Multimedia,2005,34
Paving the last mile for multi-channel multimedia presentation generation,Ansgar Scherp; Susanne Boll,Users of multimedia applications today are equipped with a variety of different (mobile)devices that each come with different operating systems; memory and CPU capabilities;network connections; and also different software such as multimedia players. To be able toefficiently deliver appealing multimedia presentations to all the users; we need to overcomethe last mile in multimedia presentation delivery and meet the different requirements at theend user's site. Consequently; one needs to provide multi-channel multimedia presentationgeneration such that all different users can get and use it in their individual deviceconfiguration. With our approach; we aim at developing an abstract multimedia contentmodel that embeds the central characteristics of today's multimedia presentation formats: thedefinition of the temporal and spatial layout as well as the interaction possibilities.

Survey on modeling and indexing events in multimedia,Ansgar Scherp; Vasileios Mezaris,Abstract Events have gained increasing interest in the area of multimedia in recent years.There have been many approaches published and research conducted on how to extractevents from multimedia; represent it using appropriate models; and how to use events in enduser applications. In this paper; we conduct an extensive analysis of existing event modelsalong commonly identified aspects of events. In addition; we analyze how the differentaspects of events relate to each other and how they can be applied together. Subsequently;we look into different approaches for how to index multimedia data. Finally; we elaborate onhow to link the multimedia data with events in order to provide the basis for future event-based multimedia applications.,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2014,30
Canonical processes for creating personalized semantically rich multimedia presentations,Ansgar Scherp,Abstract Authoring of multimedia content can be considered as composing media assetssuch as images; videos; text; and audio in time; space; and interaction into a coherentmultimedia presentation. Personalization of such content means that it reflects the users' oruser groups' profile information and context information. Enriching the multimedia contentwith semantically rich metadata allows for a better search and retrieval of the content. Toactually create personalized semantically-rich multimedia content; a manual authoring of themany different documents for all the different users' and user groups' needs is not feasible.Rather a (semi-) automatic authoring of the content seems reasonable. We have analyzed indetail today's approaches and systems for authoring; personalizing; and semanticallyenriching multimedia presentations. Based on this analysis; we derived a general …,Multimedia Systems,2008,30
A core ontology on events for representing occurrences in the real world,Ansgar Scherp; Thomas Franz; Carsten Saathoff; Steffen Staab,Abstract Events are central aspect of many semantic ambient media applications such assurveillance; smart homes; automobiles; and others. Existing models for events typically donot follow a systematic development approach; are conceptually narrow with respect toevent features; and their semantics is often ambiguous. This makes the communicationbetween and integration of different event-based components and event-based semanticambient media applications a challenging task. In this paper; we present the Event-Model-F;a formal model of events based on the foundational ontology DOLCE+ DnS Ultralite (DUL).The Event-Model-F provides comprehensive support to represent time and space; objectsand persons; mereological; causal; and correlative relationships between events; anddifferent interpretations of the same event.

Lover: support for modeling data using linked open vocabularies,Johann Schaible; Thomas Gottron; Stefan Scheglmann; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract Various best practices and principles are provided to guide an ontology engineerwhen modeling Linked Data. The choice of appropriate vocabularies is one essential aspectin the guidelines; as it leads to better interpretation; querying; and consumption of the databy Linked Data applications and users. In this paper; we propose LOVER: a novel approachto support the ontology engineer in modeling a Linked Data dataset. We illustrate theconcept of LOVER; which supports the engineer by recommending appropriate classes andproperties from existing and actively used vocabularies. The recommendations are made onthe basis of on an iterative multimodal search. It uses different; orthogonal informationsources for finding vocabulary terms; eg based on a best string match or schema informationon other datasets published in the Linked Open Data cloud.

Survey on common strategies of vocabulary reuse in linked open data modeling,Johann Schaible; Thomas Gottron; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract The choice of which vocabulary to reuse when modeling and publishing LinkedOpen Data (LOD) is far from trivial. There is no study that investigates the different strategiesof reusing vocabularies for LOD modeling and publishing. In this paper; we present theresults of a survey with 79 participants that examines the most preferred vocabulary reusestrategies of LOD modeling. The participants; LOD publishers and practitioners; were askedto assess different vocabulary reuse strategies and explain their ranking decision. We foundsignificant differences between the modeling strategies that range from reusing popularvocabularies; minimizing the number of vocabularies; and staying within one domainvocabulary.

We present an event-based approach for users to explore; annotate and sharemedia. We are constructing a web-based environment that allows users to explore andselect events; including discovering meaningful; surprising or entertaining connectionsamong them. We build a knowledge base of events from event directories that will be linkedto the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud; in conjunction with event and media ontologies. Theapproach is user-driven and; having carried out initial user inquiries; we are designinginterfaces that support user-identified tasks while exploring the connections between users;multimedia content and events.,1st International Workshop on EVENTS-Recognising and tracking events on the Web and in real life,2010,26

Towards an ecosystem for semantics,Ansgar Scherp; Ramesh Jain,Abstract Multimedia does not exhibit a unique semantics but multiple semantics that areinfluenced by many factors. Current approaches and systems lack from considering thisproblemin its entirety. What is needed is a holistic approach that describes and embracesthe complex and challenging problem of multimedia semantics. Consequently; we aredeveloping with the Semantics Ecosystem (SES) an approach that aimsat providing a"framework" for solving this problem. The SES defines five types of semantics and theirrelationships to each other and to the real world. In the paper; we present the SES and showits application to the domain of authoring multimedia albums. We show the benefits ofhaving such a theoretical framework to handle the semantics of multimedia albums. TheSES allows us to better understand; describe; and communicate the many different factors …,Workshop on multimedia information retrieval on The many faces of multimedia semantics,2007,22
Metaxa—context-and content-driven metadata enhancement for personal photo books,Susanne Boll; Philipp Sandhaus; Ansgar Scherp; Sabine Thieme,Abstract Making a photo book as a special gift to your beloved can be very time-consuming.One has to carefully select and arrange the pictures nicely over the pages of a previouslybought photo book. In these days; photo finisher companies are able to directly print andbind a nice photo book from a selected set of images. But for the users of the software thatcomes with the album creation; the selection and arrangement of pictures in the album stillremains a tedious task. What is missing are easy and good suggestions which pictures toselect and how to arrange them into a personal photo book. A higher availability of metadatawith the pictures could enable a content-driven and context-driven selection and makealbum creation better and easier.

Real-life events in multimedia: detection; representation; retrieval; and applications,Vasileios Mezaris; Ansgar Scherp; Ramesh Jain; Mohan S Kankanhalli,The multimedia content that all of us frequently capture with our different multimedia enableddevices (eg cameras; smartphones; tablets) is typically the digital residue of a real-life eventthat unfolded before us; such as a graduation; a trip; a football game; or a natural disaster; itis this real-life event that we try to immortalize through the digital content creation process.Similarly; at an organizational (as opposed to personal) scale; multimedia content such assatellite images and radar signals are often captured in order to document natural or man-induced real-life events; such as weather phenomena or sea pollution incidents.

Or it is provided implicitly via the definition of the resources' properties. In thispaper; we present a method and metrics to analyse the information theoretic properties andthe correlation between the two manifestations of schema information. Furthermore; weactually perform such an analysis on large-scale linked data sets. To this end; we haveextracted schema information regarding the types and properties defined in the data setsegments provided for the Billion Triples Challenge 2012.

Lodatio: using a schema-level index to support users infinding relevant sources of linked data,Thomas Gottron; Ansgar Scherp; Bastian Krayer; Arne Peters,Abstract The Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud provides a vast amount of heterogeneous data;distributed over numerous data sources. This makes it difficult to find those data sources inthe cloud which are relevant for a given information need. Existing search engines for theSemantic Web focus on instance-oriented information needs; ie; searching for specific RDFinstances or literals and exploring the search results. However; they do not address thequestion of finding linked data sources relevant to a schema-oriented information need; ie;queries based on triple patterns relating to a specific combination of RDF types and/orproperties.

Emergent Semantics in Personalized Multimedia Content.,Ansgar Scherp; Susanne Boll; Holger Cremer,ABSTRACT: Authoring of personalized multimedia content can be considered as a processconsisting of selecting; composing; and assembling media elements into coherentmultimedia presentations that meet the user's or user group's preferences; interests; currentsituation; and environment. In the approaches we find today; media items and semanticallyrich metadata information are used for the selection and composition task. However; mostvaluable semantics for the media elements and the resulting multimedia content that emergewith and in the authoring process are not considered any further. This means that the effortfor semantically enriching media content comes to a sudden halt in the created multimediadocument–which is very unfortunate. In this paper; we propose with the SemanticMM4Uframework an integrated approach for deriving and exploiting multimedia semantics that …,Journal of Digital Information Management,2007,18
Change-a-LOD: does the schema on the linked data cloud change or not?,Renata Queiroz Dividino; Ansgar Scherp; Gerd Gröner; Thomas Grotton,Abstract Recent work analyzing changes on the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud on fine-grained weekly snapshots shows that vocabularies published on the cloud are highly static.While this result is quite expected; there is another kind of schematic information that can beobserved on the LOD cloud: the use of the vocabularies in the cloud. With use; we mean thecombinations of sets of properties and sets of types to describe the resources in a specificdomain. Current literature does not tackle this question sufficiently. In order to gain insightinto how the use of vocabularies on the LOD cloud changes over time; we presentillustrating examples and a formalization of the research question. Subsequently; we presentearly results of experiments applied on weekly snapshots that show that the use ofvocabularies indeed changes quite a lot over time.,COLD,2013,17
Modeling; detecting; and processing events in multimedia,Ansgar Scherp; Ramesh Jain; Mohan Kankanhalli; Vasileios Mezaris,Humans think in terms of events and entities. Events provide a natural abstraction ofhappenings in the real world. The concept of events has a long history in foundationalsciences such as philosophy and linguistics. After first developing objects-based and entity-based approaches; computer science research is now addressing the concept of events andbuilding many applications that consider events at least as important as objects.Consequently; we find many different solutions and approaches for modeling; detecting; andprocessing events. In addition; we find different applications that are based on events andmake use of events.,Proceedings of the 18th ACM international conference on Multimedia,2010,17
Leveraging web 2.0 communities in professional organisations,A Scherp; F Schwagereit; N Ireson; V Lanfranchi; S Papadopoulos; A Kritikos; Y Kompatsiaris; P Smrz,ABSTRACT Professional organisations are beginning to see the potential offered by Web2.0 techniques and social networks to improve communication and collaboration with usercommunities. This leads to a need to consider how the closer interaction with communitiesinfluences the knowledge management in organisations; and how organisational interactionwill affect the communities. There is high potential for deriving mutual benefits through theinfluence of social networks in form of Web 2.0 communities to the decision making takingplace within organisations. However there are also potential hazards and challenges whicharise from this new collaboration with respect to privacy; trust and reputation of individualsand organisations.

We introduce and compare two novel eye-tracking-based measures for conducting such assignments: The segmentation measureuses automatically computed image segments and selects the one segment the user fixatesfor the longest time. The heat map measure is based on traditional gaze heat maps andsums up the users' fixation durations per pixel. Both measures are applied on gaze dataobtained for a set of social media images; which have manually labeled objects as groundtruth. We have determined a maximum average precision of 65% at which the segmentationmeasure points to the correct region in the image. The best coverage of the segments isobtained for the segmentation measure with a F-measure of 35%. Overall; both newly …,International Conference on Multimedia Modeling,2013,15
Event-centric media management,Ansgar Scherp; Srikanth Agaram; Ramesh Jain,The management of the vast amount of media assets captured at every day events such asmeetings; birthday parties; vacation; and conferences has become an increasinglychallenging problem. Today; most media management applications are media-centric. Thismeans; they put the captured media assets into the center of the management. However; inrecent years it has been proposed that events are a much better abstraction of humanexperience and thus provide a more appropriate means for managing media assets.Consequently; approaches that include events into their media management solution havebeen explored. However; they typically consider events only as some more metadata thatcan be extracted from the media assets. In addition; today's applications and approachesconcentrate on particular problems such as event detection; tagging; sharing …,Multimedia Content Access: Algorithms and Systems II,2008,15

Today; fullyautomatic approaches are at hand for supporting users. They make use of pixel informationextracted from the images; analyze contextual information such as capture time and focalaperture; or use both to determine a proper subset of photos. However; these approachesmiss the most important factor in the photo selection process: the user. The goal of ourapproach is to consider individual interests. By recording and analyzing gaze informationfrom the user's viewing photo collections; we obtain information on user's interests and usethis information in the creation of personal photo selections.

Thus; this paper analyses traditional knowledgemanagement processes in the context of Web 2.0 processes and presents an alignment in acommon knowledge management model. We believe that an understanding and alignmentof the Web 2.0 and the traditional knowledge management processes is essential to fullyrealise the potential of designing and developing Web 2.0 knowledge managementapplications. The common model clearly shows where each Web 2.0 process can beapplied; and thus the different characteristics of the Web 2.0 and organisational …,Wissensmanagement,2009,14
The semantic web: collective intelligence on the web,Maciej Janik; Ansgar Scherp; Steffen Staab,Abstract The World Wide Web has turned hypertext into a success story by enabling world-wide sharing of unstructured information and informal knowledge. The Semantic Webtargets the sharing of structured information and formal knowledge pursuing objectives ofachieving collective intelligence on the Web. Germane to the structure of the Semantic Webis a layering and standardization of concerns. These concerns are reflected by anarchitecture of the Semantic Web that we present through a common use case. SemanticWeb data for the use case is now found on the Web and is part of a quickly growing set ofSemantic Web resources available for formal processing.,Informatik-Spektrum,2011,13
Schemex–web-scale indexed schema extraction of linked open data,Mathias Konrath; Thomas Gottron; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract. We present SchemEX; an approach and tool for web-scale; real-time indexing andschema extraction of Linked Open Data (LOD) at linear runtime complexity. As we cannotassume that a complete retrieval of the LOD cloud on a local machine is feasible; we followa stream-based approach that makes no assumption about how the RDF triples areretrieved from the web by a data crawler. We show the applicability of our approach byapplying SchemEX to the Billion Triple Challenge Dataset 2011 and a smaller dataset with11M triples.,Semantic Web Challenge; Submission to the Billion Triple Track,2011,13
M3O: the multimedia metadata ontology,Carsten Saathoff; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract. We propose the Multimedia Metadata Ontology (M3O); a framework for integratingthe central aspects of multimedia metadata. These central aspects are the separation of theinformation conveyed by multimedia items and their realization; the annotation with bothsemantic and low-level metadata; and the decomposition of multimedia content. M3O baseson Semantic Web technologies and provides the means for rich semantic annotation usingfurther; possibly domain-specific ontologies. Moreover; it can be used to represent otherexisting metadata models and metadata standards. We introduce the M3O and present itsapplication at the example of a SMIL presentation.,Proceedings of the Workshop on Semantic Multimedia Database Technologies; 10th International Workshop of the Multimedia Metadata Community (SeMuDaTe 2009); Graz; Austria,2009,13
From Changes to Dynamics: Dynamics Analysis of Linked Open Data Sources.,Renata Queiroz Dividino; Thomas Gottron; Ansgar Scherp; Gerd Gröner,Abstract The Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud changes frequently. Recent approaches focusmainly on quantifying the changes that occur in the LOD cloud by comparing two snapshotsof a linked dataset captured at two different points in time. These change metrics are able tomeasure absolute changes between these two snapshots. However; they cannot determinethe dynamics of a dataset over a period of time; ie; the intensity of how the data evolved inthis period. In this paper; we present a general framework to analyze the dynamics of linkeddatasets within a given time interval. We propose a function to measure the dynamics of aLOD dataset; which is defined as the aggregation of absolute; infinitesimal changes;provided by change metrics. Our method can be parametrized to incorporate and make useof existing change metrics. Furthermore; our framework enables the use of different decay …,PROFILES@ ESWC,2014,12
A method for integrating multimedia metadata standards and metadata formats with the multimedia metadata ontology,Ansgar Scherp; DANIEL EIßING; Carsten Saathoff,The M3O abstracts from the existing metadata standards and formats and provides genericmodeling solutions for annotations; decompositions; and provenance of metadata. Being ageneric modeling framework; the M3O aims at integrating the existing metadata standardsand metadata formats rather than replacing them. This is in particular useful as today'smultimedia applications often need to combine and use more than one existing metadatastandard or metadata format at the same time. However; applying and specializing theabstract and powerful M3O modeling framework in concrete application domains andintegrating it with existing metadata formats and metadata standards is not alwaysstraightforward. Thus; we have developed a step-by-step alignment method that describeshow to integrate existing multimedia metadata standards and metadata formats with the …,International Journal of Semantic Computing,2012,12
Emerging; collective intelligence for personal; organisational and social use,Sotiris Diplaris; Andreas Sonnenbichler; Tomasz Kaczanowski; Phivos Mylonas; Ansgar Scherp; Maciej Janik; Symeon Papadopoulos; Michael Ovelgoenne; Yiannis Kompatsiaris,Abstract The main objective of this chapter is to present novel technologies for exploitingmultiple layers of intelligence from user-contributed content; which together constituteCollective Intelligence; a form of intelligence that emerges from the collaboration andcompetition among many individuals; and that seemingly has a mind of its own. Usercontributed content is analysed by integrating research and development in media analysis;mass content processing; user feedback; social analysis and knowledge management toautomatically extract the hidden intelligence and make it accessible to end users andorganisations. The exploitation of the emerging Collective Intelligence results is showcasedin two distinct case studies: an Emergency Response and a Consumers Social Group casestudy.,*,2011,12

Different layers of intelligence are generated; which togetherconstitute the notion of Collective Intelligence. The automatic generation of CollectiveIntelligence constitutes a departure from traditional methods for information sharing; sinceinformation from both the multimedia content and social aspects will be merged; while at thesame time the social dynamics will be taken into account.

Strategies for efficiently keeping local linked open data caches up-to-date,Renata Dividino; Thomas Gottron; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract Quite often; Linked Open Data (LOD) applications pre-fetch data from the Web andstore local copies of it in a cache for faster access at runtime. Yet; recent investigations haveshown that data published and interlinked on the LOD cloud is subject to frequent changes.As the data in the cloud changes; local copies of the data need to be updated. However; dueto limitations of the available computational resources (eg; network bandwidth for fetchingdata; computation time) LOD applications may not be able to permanently visit all of the LODsources at brief intervals in order to check for changes. These limitations imply the need toprioritize which data sources should be considered first for retrieving their data andsynchronizing the local copy with the original data. In order to make best use of theresources available; it is vital to choose a good scheduling strategy to know when to fetch …,International Semantic Web Conference,2015,10

A framework for iterative signing of graph data on the web,Andreas Kasten; Ansgar Scherp; Peter Schauß,Abstract Existing algorithms for signing graph data typically do not cover the whole signingprocess. In addition; they lack distinctive features such as signing graph data at differentlevels of granularity; iterative signing of graph data; and signing multiple graphs. In thispaper; we introduce a novel framework for signing arbitrary graph data provided; e g.; asRDF (S); Named Graphs; or OWL. We conduct an extensive theoretical and empiricalanalysis of the runtime and space complexity of different framework configurations. Theexperiments are performed on synthetic and real-world graph data of different size anddifferent number of blank nodes. We investigate security issues; present a trust model; anddiscuss practical considerations for using our signing framework.,European Semantic Web Conference,2014,10
Designing a process guidance system to support user’s business process compliance,Stefan Morana; Silvia Schacht; Ansgar Scherp; Alexander Maedche,Abstract Organizations define business processes specifying how employees shouldconduct their daily work. They require their employees to conform to defined processstandards in order to avoid expensive mistakes and ensure the intended process outcomes.From a research perspective; process compliance has been primarily addressed byprocesscentric information systems supporting the execution of business processes.However; employees still have difficulties in being process compliant. What is missing is thedirect support for users in the proper execution of business processes within the actual workenvironment. We follow a design science approach to address this gap and suggest aprocess guidance system supporting users' business process compliance.

Survey on governance of user-generated content in web communities,Felix Schwagereit; Ansgar Scherp; Steffen Staab,Abstract Web communities court for the users' favor. Maintaining a high quality of the user-generated content is a foundation of a healthy and flourishing community. In order tomaintain this quality; the community platform needs governance. Governance of a webcommunity can be understood as steering and coordinating the activities of communitymembers. This includes viewing and reviewing of already existing content but alsolimitations for creating and sharing new content. In this paper; we systematically reviewsuccessful web communities for creating and sharing user-generated content. To this end;we have grouped the communities into the following four categories: Social Media; News;Social Reviewing; and Social Networking; we have chosen the five most prominent webplatforms from Alexa Page Rank. For our survey of these platforms; we have analyzed the …,Proceedings of the 3rd International Web Science Conference,2011,10
A comparison of different strategies for automated semantic document annotation,Gregor Große-Bölting; Chifumi Nishioka; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract We introduce a framework for automated semantic document annotation that iscomposed of four processes; namely concept extraction; concept activation; annotationselection; and evaluation. The framework is used to implement and compare differentannotation strategies motivated by the literature. For concept extraction; we apply entitydetection with semantic hierarchical knowledge bases; Tri-gram; RAKE; and LDA. Forconcept activation; we compare a set of statistical; hierarchy-based; and graph-basedmethods. For selecting annotations; we compare top-k as well as kNN. In total; we define 43different strategies including novel combinations like using graph-based activation with kNN.We have evaluated the strategies using three different datasets of varying size from threescientific disciplines (economics; politics; and computer science) that contain 100; 000 …,Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Knowledge Capture,2015,9
Interactive faceted search and exploration of open social media data on a touchscreen mobile phone,Alexander Kleinen; Ansgar Scherp; Steffen Staab,Abstract A central challenge of semantic ambient media applications is designing smart userinterfaces that are able to dynamically deal with an a-priori unknown number of datacategories and data instances received live from different Linked Open Data sources whileat the same time being intuitive and easy to use. In the mobile world; this challenge is evenmore difficult as the mobile devices have limited interaction possibilities and smaller displaysize. In this paper; we tackle this challenge and present the user-centered; iterative design ofa mobile application for faceted search and exploration of a large; multi-dimensional dataset of open social media on a touchscreen mobile phone. The application is called MobileFacets and provides live retrieval and interactive search and exploration of resources likeplaces; persons; organizations; and events originating from different; integrated social …,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2014,9
Identifying objects in images from analyzing the users’ gaze movements for provided tags,Tina Walber; Ansgar Scherp; Steffen Staab,Abstract Assuming that eye tracking will be a common input device in the near future innotebooks and mobile devices like iPads; it is possible to implicitly gain information aboutimages and image regions from these users' gaze movements. In this paper; we investigatethe principle idea of finding specific objects shown in images by looking at the users' gazepath information only. We have analyzed 547 gaze paths from 20 subjects viewing differentimage-tag-pairs with the task to decide if the tag presented is actually found in the image ornot. By analyzing the gaze paths; we are able to correctly identify 67% of the image regionsand significantly outperform two baselines. In addition; we have investigated if differentregions of the same image can be differentiated by the gaze information. Here; we are ableto correctly identify two different regions in the same image with an accuracy of 38%.,International Conference on Multimedia Modeling,2012,9

Collaborative semantic points of interests,Max Braun; Ansgar Scherp; Steffen Staab,Abstract The novel mobile application csxPOI (short for: collaborative; semantic; and context-aware points-of-interest) enables its users to collaboratively create; share; and modifysemantic points of interest (POI). Semantic POIs describe geographic places with explicitsemantic properties of a collaboratively created ontology. As the ontology includes multiplesubclassifications and instantiations and as it links to DBpedia; the richness of annotationgoes far beyond mere textual annotations such as tags. Users can search for POIs throughthe subclass hierarchy of the collaboratively created ontology. For example; a POI annotatedas bakery can be found through the search string shop as it is a superclass of bakery. Datamining techniques are employed to cluster and thus improve the quality of thecollaboratively created POIs.,Extended Semantic Web Conference,2010,9
Representing distributed groups with dgFOAF,Felix Schwagereit; Ansgar Scherp; Steffen Staab,Abstract Managing one's memberships in different online communities increasinglybecomes a cumbersome task. This is due to the increasing number of communities in whichusers participate and in which they share information with different groups of people likecolleagues; sports clubs; groups with specific interests; family; friends; and others. Thesegroups use different platforms to perform their tasks such as collaborative creation ofdocuments; sharing of documents and media; conducting polls; and others. Thus; the groupsare scattered and distributed over multiple community platforms that each require a distinctuser account and management of the group. In this paper; we present dg FOAF; anapproach for distributed group management based on the well known Friend-of-a-Friend(FOAF) vocabulary. Our dg FOAF approach is independent of the concrete community …,Extended Semantic Web Conference,2010,9
Collaborative creation of semantic points of interest as linked data on the mobile phone,Max Braun; Ansgar Scherp; Steffen Staab,Abstract. The novel mobile application csxPOI (short for: collaborative; semantic; and context-aware points-of-interest) enables its users to collaboratively create; share; and modifysemantic points of interest (POI). Semantic POIs describe geographic places with explicitsemantic properties of a collaboratively created ontology. As the ontology includes multiplesubclassifications and instantiations and as it links to DBpedia; the richness of annotationgoes far beyond mere textual annotations such as tags. With the intuitive interface of csxPOI;users can easily create; delete; and modify their POIs and those shared by others. Thereby;the users adapt the structure of the ontology underlying the semantic annotations of thePOIs.

Profiling vs. time vs. content: What does matter for top-k publication recommendation based on Twitter profiles?,Chifumi Nishioka; Ansgar Scherp,So far it is unclear how different factors of a scientific publication recommender systembased on users' tweets have an influence on the recommendation performance. Weexamine three different factors; namely profiling method; temporal decay; and richness ofcontent. Regarding profiling; we compare CF-IDF that replaces terms in TF-IDF by semanticconcepts; HCF-IDF as novel hierarchical variant of CF-IDF; and topic modeling. As temporaldecay functions; we apply sliding window and exponential decay. In terms of the richness ofcontent; we compare recommendations using both full-texts and titles of publications andusing only titles. Overall; the three factors make twelve recommendation strategies. We haveconducted an online experiment with 123 participants and compared the strategies in awithin-group design. The best recommendations are achieved by the strategy combining …,Digital Libraries (JCDL); 2016 IEEE/ACM Joint Conference on,2016,8
Generic process for extracting user profiles from social media using hierarchical knowledge bases,Gregor Große-Bölting; Chifumi Nishioka; Ansgar Scherp,We present the design and application of a generic approach for semantic extraction ofprofessional interests from social media using a hierarchical knowledge-base andspreading activation theory. By this; we can assess to which extend a user's social media lifereflects his or her professional life. Detecting named entities related to professional interestsis conducted by a taxonomy of terms in a particular domain. It can be assumed that one canfreely obtain such a taxonomy for many professional fields including computer science;social sciences; economics; agriculture; medicine; and so on. In our experiments; weconsider the domain of computer science and extract professional interests from a user'sTwitter stream.

A comparative user study of faceted search in large data hierarchies on mobile devices,Mark Schneider; Ansgar Scherp; Jochen Hunz,Abstract We compare two approaches for exploring large; hierarchical data spaces onmobile devices using facets. While the first approach arranges the facets in a 3x3 grid; thesecond approach makes use of a scrollable list of facets for exploring the data. As concretescenario; we use category hierarchies that are dynamically obtained from different;distributed social media sources. We have conducted a between-group experiment of thetwo approaches with 64 subjects (41 male; 23 female) executing the same set of tasks oftypical mobile users' information needs. The results show that subjects using the grid-basedapproach require significantly more time and more clicks for completing the tasks. However;regarding the subjects' satisfaction there is no significant difference between the twoapproaches.

A lightweight process model and development methodology for component frameworks,Ansgar Scherp; Susanne Boll,ABSTRACT Software frameworks typically constitute a semi-finished software architecturefor a complex application domain that can be adapted to the needs and requirements of aconcrete application in the domain. Since the introduction of objectoriented frameworks inthe late eighties; the development of software frameworks is still costly and difficult to handle.To reduce development risk; process models and development methodologies for object-oriented frameworks have been developed; eg; the hot-spot-driven approach by Pree. Withthe emergence of component technology also so-called component frameworks appearedthat are currently considered as the highest level of software architecture reuse. In contrastto object-oriented frameworks; a proper process model for component frameworks is stillmissing.

TermPicker: enabling the reuse of vocabulary terms by exploiting data from the linked open data cloud,Johann Schaible; Thomas Gottron; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract Deciding which RDF vocabulary terms to use when modeling data as Linked OpenData (LOD) is far from trivial. In this paper; we propose TermPicker as a novel approachenabling vocabulary reuse by recommending vocabulary terms based on various features ofa term. These features include the term's popularity; whether it is from an already usedvocabulary; and the so-called schema-level pattern (SLP) feature that exploits which termsother data providers on the LOD cloud use to describe their data. We apply Learning ToRank to establish a ranking model for vocabulary terms based on the utilized features. Theresults show that using the SLP-feature improves the recommendation quality by 29–36%considering the Mean Average Precision and the Mean Reciprocal Rank at the first fivepositions compared to recommendations based on solely the term's popularity and …,International Semantic Web Conference,2016,7
Multi-oriented text extraction from information graphics,Falk Böschen; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract Existing research on analyzing information graphics assume to have a perfect textdetection and extraction available. However; text extraction from information graphics is farfrom solved. To fill this gap; we propose a novel processing pipeline for multi-oriented textextraction from infographics. The pipeline applies a combination of data mining andcomputer vision techniques to identify text elements; cluster them into text lines; computetheir orientation; and uses a state-of-the-art open source OCR engine to perform the textrecognition. We evaluate our method on 121 infographics extracted from an open accesscorpus of scientific publications. The results show that our approach is effective andsignificantly outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline.,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM Symposium on Document Engineering,2015,7

We present an approach where one can execute user defined SPARQL queries onencrypted graph data. The graph data is only partially revealed to those users authorized forexecuting a query. The approach is based on eight different types of queries; correspondingto the different binding possibilities in a single SPARQL triple pattern. The allowed queriescan be further restricted by the owner of the graph data; eg; through pre-defining a specificpredicate or object. Single triple patterns can be combined to query group patterns as theycan be stated in SPARQL queries and allow to execute a wide range of SELECT and ASKqueries.,PrivOn@ ISWC,2013,7
Declarative representation of programming access to ontologies,Stefan Scheglmann; Ansgar Scherp; Steffen Staab,Abstract Using ontologies in software applications is a challenging task due to the chasmbetween the logics-based world of ontologies and the object-oriented world of softwareapplications. The logics-based representation emphasizes the meaning of concepts andproperties; ie; their semantics. The modeler in the object-oriented paradigm also takes intoaccount the pragmatics; ie; how the classes are used; by whom; and why. To enable acomprehensive use of logics-based representations in object-oriented software systems; aseamless integration of the two paradigms is needed. However; the pragmatic issues ofusing logic-based knowledge in object-oriented software applications has yet not beenconsidered sufficiently. Rather; the pragmatic issues that arise in using an ontology; eg;which classes to instantiate in which order; remains a task to be carefully considered by …,Extended Semantic Web Conference,2012,7

Analysis of schema structures in the linked open data graph based on unique subject uris; pay-level domains; and vocabulary usage,Thomas Gottron; Malte Knauf; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract The Linked Open Data (LOD) graph represents a web-scale distributed knowledgegraph interlinking information about entities across various domains. A core concept is thelack of pre-defined schema which actually allows for flexibly modelling data from all kinds ofdomains. However; Linked Data does exhibit schema information in a twofold way: byexplicitly attaching RDF types to the entities and implicitly by using domain-specificproperties to describe the entities. In this paper; we present and apply different techniquesfor investigating the schematic information encoded in the LOD graph at different levels ofgranularity. We investigate different information theoretic properties of so-called UniqueSubject URIs (USUs) and measure the correlation between the properties and types that canbe observed for USUs on a large-scale semantic graph data set.

At the same time; cultural institutionsare trying to attract interested communities to their carefully planned cultural programs. Todistribute these cultural events to the right people; we developed a framework that willaggregate; enrich; recommend and distribute these events as targeted as possible. Theaggregated events are published as Linked Open Data using an RDF/OWL representationof the EventsML-G2 standard.

The handling of documents within organizations isstill an issue in both; research and practice. Employees perceive the way to handle business-relevant documents as high effort and struggle with handling documents compliant toorganizational standards. As a result documents become decoupled from the definedbusiness processes and scattered all over the organizations IT landscape.

Implicit procedural knowledge in theorganization is made explicit by defining processes. This approach is not applicable toindividual knowledge work due to its high complexity and variability. However; withoutexplicitly described processes there is no analysis and efficient communication of bestpractices of individual knowledge work within the organization. In addition; the activities ofthe individual knowledge work cannot be synchronized with the activities in theorganizational knowledge work.

Iterative signing of RDF (S) graphs; named graphs; and OWL graphs: Formalization and application,Andreas Kasten; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract. When publishing graph data on the web such as vocabularies using RDF (S) orOWL; one has only limited means to verify the authenticity and integrity of the graph data.Today's approaches require a high signature overhead and do not allow for an iterativesigning of graph data. This paper presents a formally defined framework for signing arbitrarygraph data provided in RDF (S); Named Graphs; or OWL. Our framework supports signinggraph data at different levels of granularity: minimum self-contained graphs (MSG); sets ofMSGs; and entire graphs. It supports for an iterative signing of graph data; eg; when differentparties provide different parts of a common graph; and allows for signing multiple graphs.Both can be done with a constant; low overhead for the signature graph; even wheniteratively signing graph data.,*,2007,5

Creation of individual photo selections: Read preferences from the users' eyes,Tina Walber; Chantal Neuhaus; Steffen Staab; Ansgar Scherp; Ramesh Jain,Abstract The automated selection of satisfying subsets from large collections of photos is acentral challenge in multimedia research. Objective criteria like the depiction of persons orthe photo quality are met by existing approaches. But it is difficult to know the users' personalinterest; which plays an important role in the selection process. The expected spread ofdevices with eye tracking support in the near future allows us to measure this interest in anew way. In an experiment with 12 participants; we derive the most interesting photos of acollection for every person from gaze information recorded during the free viewing of thephotos. We can show that the eye tracking information delivers valuable information aboutthe users' preferences by comparing the results to a manual selection. The selection basedon gaze information significantly outperforms baseline approaches and improves the …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Multimedia,2013,4
A pattern system for describing the semantics of structured multimedia documents,Ansgar Scherp; Carsten Saathoff; Stefan Scheglmann,Today's metadata models and metadata standards often focus on a specific media type only;lack combinability with other metadata models; or are limited with respect to the featuresthey support. Thus they are not sufficient to describe the semantics of rich; structuredmultimedia documents. To overcome these limitations; we have developed acomprehensive model for representing multimedia metadata; the Multimedia MetadataOntology (M3O). The M3O has been developed by an extensive analysis of related work andabstracts from the features of existing metadata models and metadata standards. It is basedon the foundational ontology DOLCE+ DnS Ultralight and makes use of ontology designpatterns. The M3O serves as generic modeling framework for integrating the existingmetadata models and metadata standards rather than replacing them. As such; the M3O …,International Journal of Semantic Computing,2012,4
Stevie-collaborative creation and exchange of events and pois on a mobile phone,Max Braun; Daniel Schmeiß; Ansgar Scherp; Steffen Staab,Abstract We propose a model and mobile application for the collaborative creation andsharing of semantic points of interest (POIs) and events. We annotate events and POIs withsemantic categories and support search through an ontology of these categories. By this;users are able to find; eg; an event of a jazz jam session through the query string concerteven though the event has only been annotated with the concept of a jam session. Unlikeexisting applications; each user can modify any event and POI stored in the system. To thisend; we consider the creation; modification; as well as deletion operations on events andPOIs as contributions within our system. Even with delete operations the actual events andPOIs are not permanently removed from the database. This allows rollbacks; eg; if data hasbeen arbitrarily deleted by spammers. The model has been implemented in our mobile …,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM international workshop on Events in multimedia,2010,4
Guest editors' introduction: The many faces of semantics,Farshad Fotouhi; William I Grosky; Peter Stanchev,The Semantic Web enables programs and agents to automatically understand what data isabout; and therefore bridge the so-called semantic gap between the ways in which usersrequest Web resources and the real needs of those users; ultimately improving the quality ofWeb information retrieval.

Temporal patterns and periodicity of entity dynamics in the Linked Open Data Cloud,Chifumi Nishioka; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract We present initial results of finding temporal patterns of entity dynamics on theLinked Open Data (LOD) cloud. For the analysis; we use the dataset of the three-yearobservation of the Dynamic Linked Data Observatory. Using k-means++ clustering withEuclidean distance; we reveal the temporal patterns of entity dynamics. In addition; weconduct the first investigation of periodicity in entity dynamics on the LOD cloud. While alarge portion of entities are static; a certain number of entities have a temporal pattern withsubstantial changes. We observe different periodicity with respect to temporal patterns ofentity dynamics. Knowing about the temporal patterns and their periodicity is important forapplications that are depending on fresh data caches and indices of the distributed LODcloud. They can concentrate in crawling and refreshing those parts of the LOD cloud …,Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Knowledge Capture,2015,3
Benefiting from users’ gaze: selection of image regions from eye tracking information for provided tags,Tina Walber; Ansgar Scherp; Steffen Staab,Abstract Providing image annotations is a tedious task. This becomes even morecumbersome when objects shall be annotated in the images. Such region-basedannotations can be used in various ways like similarity search or as training set in automaticobject detection. We investigate the principle idea of finding objects in images by looking atgaze paths from users; viewing images with an interest in a specific object. We haveanalyzed 799 gaze paths from 30 subjects viewing image-tag-pairs with the task to decidewhether a tag could be found in the image or not. We have compared 13 different fixationmeasures analyzing the gaze paths. The best performing fixation measure is able tocorrectly assign a tag to a region for 63% of the image-tag-pairs and significantlyoutperforms three baselines. We look into details of the image region characteristics such …,Multimedia tools and applications,2014,3
Semiotic Tagging: Enriching the Semantics of Tags for Improved Image Retrieval,Frank Nack; Ansgar Scherp; Chantal Neuhaus,SemioTag is an approach towards tagging that utilizes the semiotic sign categories icon;index; and symbol as classification structures to be used by users during the annotation andsearch of images within social media-oriented repositories. We compared the influence ofthis approach on the tagging and querying behaviour of users; with respect to usability;efficiency; and user experience; between the standard Flickr tagging and querying methodand the one used in SemioTag. Our results show that semiotic tagging is considered moretedious and takes about twice the time as standard tagging. However; subjects produced alarger number of tags with semiotic tagging. Finally; querying with semiotic tags is notconsidered more cumbersome than querying using standard tags. Subjects stated thatsemiotic-based search provides more reasonable results than search based on standard …,Semantic Computing (ICSC); 2014 IEEE International Conference on,2014,3

Conceptualization and Typology of Guidance in Information Systems,Stefan Morana; Silvia Schacht; Ansgar Scherp; Alexander Maedche,Abstract: Organizations use intelligent systems; a special kind of information system; toprovide knowledge and guidance for their employees in their daily work. Concepts ofguidance have been researched in the Information Systems community and relatedcommunities for decades. But due to the missing of a common concept and typology ofguidance it is hard to compare the findings of the existing research streams. This paperextensively reviews and analyses the work on decisional guidance; explanations and ondecision aids conducted in the last 20 years of research. Building on and grounded by theanalyzed literature; a conceptualization and typology of guidance is proposed anddiscussed. In addition; the findings on positive and negative effects of guidance are outlined.This research contributes to both; research and practice.

LODatio: A schema-based retrieval system for linked open data at web-scale,Thomas Gottron; Ansgar Scherp; Bastian Krayer; Arne Peters,Abstract The Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud has grown to an enormous source for semanticdata. Its distributed and decentralized approach is one reason for its success but also poseschallenges. A main difficulty is to identify those data sources on the LOD cloud whichprovide the information a user is actually interested in. With LODatio; we have developed aprototype retrieval system to support users in finding the right data sources for a givenschema-oriented information need. Beyond classical search system functions such asretrieval; ranking; result set size estimation and providing result snippets; LODatio providessophisticated support for the users in refining and expanding their information need.,Extended Semantic Web Conference,2013,3
Efficient graph models for retrieving top-k news feeds from ego networks,Rene Pickhardt; Thomas Gottron; Ansgar Scherp; Steffen Staab; Jonas Kunze,A key challenge of web platforms like social networking sites and services for news feedaggregation is the efficient and targeted distribution of new content items to users. This canbe formulated as the problem of retrieving the top-k news items out of the d-degree egonetwork of each given user; where the set of all users producing feeds is of size n; with n≫d≫ k and typically k<; 20. Existing approaches employ either expensive join operations onglobal indices or suffer from high redundancy through denormalization. This makes retrievalof different top-k news feeds for thousands of users per second very inefficient in a largesocial network. In this paper; we propose two graph models GRAPHITY and STOU toaddress this problem. GRAPHITY is optimized for fast retrieval of news feeds and has aruntime of O (k log (k)). The GRAPHITY index does not involve data redundancy.

Semantic Web Languages,Antoine Isaac; Simon Schenk; Ansgar Scherp,Having defined the Semantic Web infrastructure; which enables the creation of a web ofdata; two aspects remain to be seen. The first one concerns the rich semantics that wereannounced as a part of the Semantic Web vision: how can the conceptual knowledge usefulfor a range of applications be successfully ported to and exploited on the Semantic Web?The second aspect concerns the access to Semantic Web data: how can one query andsuccessfully find the information that is represented on these large RDF graphs thatconstitute the Semantic Web information sphere? The goal of this chapter is to make thereader familiar with relevant languages that address these two crucial matters: representingconceptual knowledge and querying RDF data.

Integration of existing multimedia metadata formats and metadata standards in the M3O,Daniel Eißing; Ansgar Scherp; Carsten Saathoff,Abstract With the Multimedia Metadata Ontology (M3O); we have developed a sophisticatedmodel for representing among others the annotation; decomposition; and provenance ofmultimedia metadata. The goal of the M3O is to integrate existing metadata standards andmetadata formats rather than replacing them. To this end; the M3O provides a scaffoldneeded to represent multimedia metadata. Being an abstract model for multimediametadata; it is not straightforward how to use and specialize the M3O for concreteapplication requirements and existing metadata formats and metadata standards. In thispaper; we present a step-by-step alignment method describing how to integrate andleverage existing multimedia metadata standards and metadata formats in the M3O in orderto use them in a concrete application. We demonstrate our approach by integrating three …,International Conference on Semantic and Digital Media Technologies,2010,3
Using event representation and semantic enrichment for managing and reviewing emergency incident logs,Symeon Papadopoulos; Ansgar Scherp; Neil Ireson; Ioannis Tsampoulatidis; Yiannis Kompatsiaris,Abstract During an emergency incident; several different log files are created by members ofthe Emergency Response (ER) personnel to document the emergency events that occurthroughout the incident. Managing and reviewing these logs is a critical task forunderstanding and improving the implemented ER actions. A major challenge arising in thistask is the merging of log files that are created by the different members of the ER personnelfor the incident under study. Extensive manual effort is necessary to identify criticalinformation; such as person names and locations; in order to align and merge the incominglog entries to make them suitable for review. In this paper; we present the WeKnowIt ER LogManager (WERL); a web-based application that facilitates the task of ER log merging andmanagement by automatically aligning multiple log files and extracting ER-relevant …,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM international workshop on Events in multimedia,2010,3

Interaction and user experiences with multimedia technologies: challenges and future topics,Ansgar Scherp; Frank Nack; Klara Nahrstedt; Masashi Inoue; Andreas Girgensohn; Andreas Henrich; Philipp Sandhaus; Sabine Thieme; Michelle Zhou,Abstract In this paper; we investigate future topics and challenges of interaction and userexperience in multimedia We bring together different perspectives from overlapping fields ofresearch such as multimedia; human-computer interaction; information retrieval; networkedmultimedia; and creative arts. Based on potential intersections; we define three applicationdomains to be investigated further; as they create high demand and good prospect for long-lasting developments in the future. These application domains are: media workingenvironments; media enter-/edutainment; and social media engagement. Each applicationdomain is analyzed along five dimensions; namely: information quality; presentation quality;ambience; interactivity; and user expectations. Based on this analysis; we identify the mostpressing research questions and key challenges for each area.

Does a semantic desktop facilitate your daily tasks?,Thomas Franz; Ansgar Scherp; Steffen Staab,ABSTRACT Semantic desktop environments aim at improving the effectiveness andefficiency of users carrying out daily tasks within their personal information managementinfrastructure (PIM). They support the user by transferring and exploiting the explicitsemantics of data items across different PIM applications. Whether such an approach doesindeed reach its aim of facilitating users' life and—if so—to which extent; however; remainsan open question that we address in this paper with the first summative evaluation of asemantic desktop approach. We approach the research question exploiting our ownsemantic desktop infrastructure; X-COSIM. As data corpus; we have used over 100 emailsand 50 documents extracted from the organizers of a conference-like event at our university.The evaluation has been carried out with 18 subjects.

Rethinking Distributed Query Execution on High-Speed Networks.,Abdallah Salama; Carsten Binnig; Tim Kraska; Ansgar Scherp; Tobias Ziegler,Abstract In modern high-speed RDMA-capable networks; the bandwidth to transfer dataacross machines is getting close to the bandwidth of the local memory bus. Recent work hasstarted to investigate how to redesign individual distributed query operators to best leverageRDMA. However; all these novel RDMA-based query operators are still designed for aclassical shared-nothing architecture that relies on a shuffle-based execution model toredistribute the data. In this paper; we revisit query execution for distributed databasesystems on fast networks in a more holistic manner by reconsidering all aspects from theoverall database architecture; over the partitioning scheme to the execution model. Ourexperiments show that in the best case our prototype database system called I-Store; whichis designed for fast networks from scratch; provides 3× speed-up over a shuffle-based …,IEEE Data Eng.

LOD for library science: benefits of applying linked open data in the digital library setting,Atif Latif; Ansgar Scherp; Klaus Tochtermann,Abstract Linked Open Data (LOD) has gained widespread adoption by large industries aswell as non-profit organizations and governmental organizations. One of the early adoptersof LOD technologies are libraries. Since the “early years”; libraries have been key use caseand innovation driver for LOD and significantly contributed to the adoption of semantictechnologies. The first part of this paper presents selected success stories of currentactivities in the Linked Data Library community. In a nutshell; these studies include (1) aconceptualization of the Linked Data Value chain;(2) a case study for consumption of LinkedData in a digital journal environment; and (3) an approach to publish metadata on theSemantic Web from an Open Access repository. These stories reveal a strong relationshipbetween LOD in libraries and research topics addressed in traditional fields of computer …,KI-Künstliche Intelligenz,2016,2
Qualitative Analysis of Vocabulary Evolution on the Linked Open Data Cloud.,Mohammad Abdel-Qader; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract. We analyse the evolution of vocabularies on the Linked Open Data cloud. Basedon the recent statistics of the LOD cloud; we have selected the twelve most dominantvocabularies in terms of their use in different pay-level domains. The number of versions wefound for these vocabularies range between 2 to 11. While some ontologies exist for morethan 10 years (eg; FOAF) others are only online since a few years (like DCAT). Our analysisshows that many changes occurred on annotation properties. This reflects a need for moreclarification of the terms; especially at early versions of the vocabularies. The majority ofchanges in the vocabularies are due to changes in other; imported vocabularies. Thus; thereis a co-evolution of different vocabularies. This insight has practical impacts to ontologyengineers. They not only need to consider the evolution of the vocabularies they directly …,PROFILES@ ESWC,2016,2
Information-theoretic Analysis of Entity Dynamics on the Linked Open Data Cloud.,Chifumi Nishioka; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract. The Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud is expanding continuously. Entities appear;change; and disappear over time. However; relatively little is known about the dynamics ofthe entities; ie; the characteristics of their temporal evolution. In this paper; we employclustering techniques over the dynamics of entities to determine common temporal patterns.We define an entity as RDF resource together with its attached RDF types and properties.The quality of the clusterings is evaluated using entity features such as the entities'properties; RDF types; and pay-level domain. In addition; we investigate to what extendentities that share a feature value change together over time. As dataset; we use weeklyLOD snapshots over a period of more than three years provided by the Dynamic LinkedData Observatory. Insights into the dynamics of entities on the LOD cloud has strong …,PROFILES@ ESWC,2016,2
Influence of time on user profiling and recommending researchers in social media,Chifumi Nishioka; Gregor Große-Bölting; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract We conduct two experiments to compare different scoring functions for extracteduser interests and measure the influence of using older data. We apply our experiments inthe domains of computer science and medicine. The first experiment assesses similarityscores between a user's social media profile and a corresponding user's publication profile;in order to evaluate to which extend a user's social media profile reflects his or herprofessional interests. The second experiment recommends related researchers profiled bytheir publications based on a user's social media profile. The result revealed that while thefunctions using spreading activation produce large similarity scores between a user profileand publication profile; the scoring functions with statistical methods (eg; an extension ofBM25 with spreading activation) perform best for recommendation.

Science 2.0 and Libraries-Convergence of two sides of the same coin at ZBW–Leibniz Information Centre for Economics,Isabella Peters; Ansgar Scherp; Klaus Tochtermann,ABSTRACT The “digitization” of science is currently changing the research and publicationprocesses. This change impacts in various ways not only the day-to-day work of researchersbut also library services. Libraries; however; can only manage this transition successfully ifthey engage in partnerships with the scientific community. That is; to jointly investigate thephenomena related to the digitization of science; draw conclusions; and develop newservices. The ZBW goes beyond this idea of collaboration: Since 2014; ZBW has an in-house research group consisting of three professors; five post-docs and several PhDstudents. The research group covers three aspects of Science 2.0: research on therelationship between Science 2.0 and libraries; development of Science 2.0 technologies inthe area of knowledge discovery; and user behavior research.

Formalization and Preliminary Evaluation of a Pipeline for Text Extraction From Infographics.,Falk Böschen; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract. We propose a pipeline for text extraction from infographics that makes use of anovel combination of data mining and computer vision techniques. The pipeline defines asequence of steps to identify characters; cluster them into text lines; determine their rotationangle; and apply state-of-the-art OCR to recognize the text. In this paper; we formally definethe pipeline and present its current implementation. In addition; we have conductedpreliminary evaluations over a data corpus of 121 manually annotated infographics from abroad range of illustration types such as bar charts; pie charts; and line charts; maps; andothers. We assess the results of our text extraction pipeline by comparing it with twobaselines. Finally; we sketch an outline for future work and possibilities for improving thepipeline.,LWA,2015,2

Providing alternative declarative descriptions for entity sets using parallel concept lattices,Thomas Gottron; Ansgar Scherp; Stefan Scheglmann,Abstract We propose an approach for modifying a declarative description of a set of entities(eg; a SPARQL query) for the purpose of finding alternative declarative descriptions for theentities. Such a shift in representation can help to get new insights into the data; to discoverrelated attributes; or to find a more concise description of the entities of interest. Allowing thealternative descriptions furthermore to be close approximations of the original entity setleads to more flexibility in finding such insights. Our approach is based on the construction ofparallel formal concept lattices over different sets of attributes for the same entities. Betweenthe formal concepts in the parallel lattices; we define mappings which constituteapproximations of the extent of the concepts. In this paper; we formalise the idea of two typesof mappings between parallel concept lattices; provide an implementation of these …,European Semantic Web Conference,2014,2
A novel approach for semantics-enabled search of multimedia documents on the web,Lydia Weiland; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract We present an analysis of a large corpus of multimedia documents obtained fromthe web. From this corpus of documents; we have extracted the media assets and therelation information between the assets. In order to conduct our analysis; the assets andrelations are represented using a formal ontology. The ontology not only allows forrepresenting the structure of multimedia documents but also to connect with arbitrarybackground knowledge on the web. The ontology as well as the analysis serve as basis forimplementing a novel search engine for multimedia documents on the web.,International Conference on Multimedia Modeling,2014,2
An Approach for Incremental Entity Resolution at the Example of Social Media Data.,Bernd Opitz; Timo Sztyler; Michael Jess; Florian Knip; Christian Bikar; Bernd Pfister; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract When querying data providers on the web; one has no guarantee that they will replywithin a given time. Some providers may even not answer at all. This makes it infeasible towait for a complete result before beginning with the entity resolution. In order to solve thisproblem; we present a query-time entity resolution approach that takes the asynchronousnature of the replies from data providers into account by starting the entity resolution as soonas first results are returned. Resolved entities are propagated from the entity resolutionengine to the mobile client as early as possible. Resolution results that are produced laterare send as updates to the client and thus improve earlier results.,AIMashup@ ESWC,2014,2
On the status of experimental research on the semantic web,Heiner Stuckenschmidt; Michael Schuhmacher; Johannes Knopp; Christian Meilicke; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract Experimentation is an important way to validate results of Semantic Web andComputer Science research in general. In this paper; we investigate the development andthe current status of experimental work on the Semantic Web. Based on a corpus of 500papers collected from the International Semantic Web Conferences (ISWC) over the pastdecade; we analyse the importance and the quality of experimental research conducted andcompare it to general Computer Science. We observe that the amount and quality ofexperiments are steadily increasing over time. Unlike hypothesised; we cannot confirm astatistically significant correlation between a paper's citations and the amount ofexperimental work reported. Our analysis; however; shows that papers comparingthemselves to other systems are more often cited than other papers.,International Semantic Web Conference,2013,2

Introduction to the special issue of the multimedia tools and applications journal on events in multimedia,Ansgar Scherp; Ramesh Jain; Mohan S Kankanhalli,Humans think in terms of events and entities. Events provide a natural abstraction ofhappenings in the real world. The concept of events has a long history in foundationalsciences such as philosophy and linguistics. After first developing object-based andentitybased approaches; computer science research is now addressing the concept ofevents and building many applications that consider events at least as important as objects.Consequently; we find many different solutions and approaches for modeling; detecting; andprocessing events. In addition; we find different applications that are based on events andthat make use of events. This special issue of Springer's Multimedia Tools and Applicationsjournal on Events in Multimedia focuses on the detection; modeling; and processing ofevents and applications that make use of events in the context of multimedia data.

Analysis and Comparison of Models for Individual and Organizational Knowledge Work,Ansgar Scherp; S Staab,Abstract Making implicit procedural knowledge explicit by business processes is anestablished means for analyzing and improving efficiency of organizational knowledge work.Such an explicit definition of processes is only to a limited extend applicable to individualknowledge work due to its high complexity and dynamics. Nevertheless; there are structuredand repeating activities in individual knowledge work that are worth to capture. Dynamic andad-hoc workflows allow for capturing these activities. However; they do not allow forsynchronizing them with business processes. This hampers communication of best practicesand transfer of knowledge between the knowledge workers. Our analysis shows that none ofthe existing models fully provides the desired functionality. Thus; we have developed ourown approach the pattern system strukt and applied it at the example scenario of a real …,Proceeding of Mulitkonferenz Wirtschaftsinformatik,2012,2

Extended description of the survey on common strategies of vocabulary reuse in linked open data modeling,Johann Schaible; Thomas Gottron; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract. Modeling and publishing Linked Open Data (LOD) involves the choice of whichvocabulary to use. This choice is far from trivial and poses a challenge to a Linked Dataengineer. It covers the search for appropriate vocabulary terms; making decisions regardingthe number of vocabularies to consider in the design process; as well as the way of selectingand combining vocabularies. Until today; there is no study that investigates the differentstrategies of reusing vocabularies for LOD modeling and publishing. In this paper; wepresent the results of a survey with 79 participants that examines the most preferredvocabulary reuse strategies of LOD modeling. Participants of our survey are LOD publishersand practitioners. Their task was to assess different vocabulary reuse strategies and explaintheir ranking decision.

Model-driven Generation of APIs for OWL-based Ontologies,Stefan Scheglmann; Ansgar Scherp; Steffen Staab,Abstract. Existing tools for generating application programming interfaces (APIs) forontologies lack sophisticated support for mapping the logics-based concepts of the ontologyto an appropriate object-oriented implementation of the API. Such a mapping has toovercome the fundamental differences between the semantics described in the ontology andthe pragmatics; ie; structure; functionalities; and behavior implemented in the API. Typically;concepts from the ontology are mapped one-toone to classes in the targeted programminglanguage. Such a mapping only produces concept representations but not an API at thedesired level of granularity expected by an application developer. We present a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) process to generate customized APIs for ontologies. This APIgeneration is based on the semantics defined in the ontology but also leverages …,*,2007,2
Mobile Facets–faceted search and exploration of open social media data on a touchscreen mobile phone,Alexander Kleinen; Ansgar Scherp; Steffen Staab,Abstract We present the user-centered; iterative design of Mobile Facets; a mobileapplication for the faceted search and exploration of a large; multidimensional data set ofsocial media on a touchscreen mobile phone. Mobile Facets provides retrieval of resourcessuch as places; persons; organizations; and events from an integration of different opensocial media sources and professional content sources; namely Wikipedia; Eventful;Upcoming; geo-located Flickr photos; and GeoNames.

Using Titles vs. Full-text as Source for Automated Semantic Document Annotation,Lukas Galke; Florian Mai; Alan Schelten; Dennis Brunsch; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract We conduct the first systematic comparison of automated semantic annotationbased on either the full-text or only on the title metadata of documents. Apart from theprominent text classification baselines kNN and SVM; we also compare recent techniques ofLearning to Rank and neural networks and revisit the traditional methods logistic regression;Rocchio; and Naive Bayes. Across three of our four datasets; the performance of theclassifications using only titles reaches over 90% of the quality compared to the performancewhen using the full-text.,Proceedings of the Knowledge Capture Conference,2017,1
Towards Understanding the Evolution of Vocabulary Terms in Knowledge Graphs,Mohammad Abdel-Qader; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract: Vocabularies are used for modeling data in Knowledge Graphs (KG) like theLinked Open Data Cloud and Wikidata. During their lifetime; the vocabularies of the KGs aresubject to changes. New terms are coined; while existing terms are modified or declared asdeprecated. We first quantify the amount and frequency of changes in vocabularies.Subsequently; we investigate to which extend and when the changes are adopted in theevolution of the KGs. We conduct our experiments on three large-scale KGs for which time-stamped snapshots are available; namely the Billion Triples Challenge datasets; DynamicLinked Data Observatory dataset; and Wikidata. Our results show that the change frequencyof terms is rather low; but can have high impact when adopted on a large amount ofdistributed graph data on the web. Furthermore; not all coined terms are used and most of …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.00232,2017,1
Content Recommendation through Semantic Annotation of User Reviews and Linked Data-An Extended Technical Report,Iacopo Vagliano; Diego Monti; Ansgar Scherp; Maurizio Morisio,Abstract: Nowadays; most recommender systems exploit user-provided ratings to infer theirpreferences. However; the growing popularity of social and e-commerce websites hasencouraged users to also share comments and opinions through textual reviews. In thispaper; we introduce a new recommendation approach which exploits the semanticannotation of user reviews to extract useful and non-trivial information about the items torecommend. It also relies on the knowledge freely available in the Web of Data; notably inDBpedia and Wikidata; to discover other resources connected with the annotated entities.We evaluated our approach in three domains; using both DBpedia and Wikidata.

A Comparison of Approaches for Automated Text Extraction from Scholarly Figures,Falk Böschen; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract So far; there has not been a comparative evaluation of different approaches for textextraction from scholarly figures. In order to fill this gap; we have defined a generic pipelinefor text extraction that abstracts from the existing approaches as documented in theliterature. In this paper; we use this generic pipeline to systematically evaluate and compare32 configurations for text extraction over four datasets of scholarly figures of different originand characteristics. In total; our experiments have been run over more than 400 manuallylabeled figures. The experimental results show that the approach BS-4OS results in the bestF-measure of 0.67 for the Text Location Detection and the best average LevenshteinDistance of 4.71 between the recognized text and the gold standard on all four datasetsusing the Ocropy OCR engine.,International Conference on Multimedia Modeling,2017,1

Comparing Tweet Classifications by Authors' Hashtags; Machine Learning; and Human Annotators,Chifumi Nishioka; Ansgar Scherp; Klaas Dellschaft,Over the last years; many papers have been published about how to use machine learningfor classifying postings on microblogging platforms like Twitter; eg; in order to assist users toreach tweets that interest them. Typically; the automatic classification results are thenevaluated against a gold standard classification which consists of either (i) the hashtags ofthe tweets' authors; or (ii) manual annotations of independent human annotators. In thispaper; we show that there are fundamental differences between these two kinds of goldstandard classifications; ie; human annotators are more likely to classify tweets like otherhuman annotators than like the tweets' authors. Furthermore; we discuss how thesedifferences may influence the evaluation of automatic classifications; like they may beachieved by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

On-the-fly entity resolution from distributed social media sources for mobile search and exploration,Bernd Opitz; Timo Sztyler; Michael Jess; Florian Knip; Christian Bikar; Bernd Pfister; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract We present an approach and mobile application for the interactive exploration andsearch of geo-located social media entities from different; distributed data providers on theweb. When querying the providers; the returned results typically have some overlap. Inaddition; one has no guarantee that the providers reply within a given time interval. Thus; inorder to provide users with geo-located entities in their vicinity in a timely manner; we needto take the asynchronous nature of the data providers' replies into account. Our novel on-the-fly entity resolution engine starts the entity resolution once it retrieves the first responses. Itincrementally extends the entity resolution model when more responses arrive.

Towards a Configurable Framework for Iterative Signing of Distributed Graph Data.,Andreas Kasten; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract. When publishing graph data on the web such as vocabularies using RDF (S) orOWL; one has only limited means to verify its authenticity and integrity. Today's approachesrequire a high signature overhead and do not allow for an iterative signing of graph data.This paper presents a configurable framework for signing arbitrary graph data provided inRDF (S); Named Graphs; or OWL. Our framework supports signing graph data at differentlevels of granularity: minimum selfcontained graphs (MSG); sets of MSGs; and entire graphs.It supports an iterative signing of graph data; eg; when different parties provide differentparts of a common graph; and allows for signing multiple graphs. Both can be done with aconstant; low overhead for the signature graph; even when iteratively signing graph data.,PrivOn@ ISWC,2013,1

Towards improving the understanding of image semantics by gaze-based tag-to-region assignments,Tina Walber; Ansgar Scherp; Steffen Staab,Abstract Eye-trackers have been used in the past to identify visual foci in images; find task-related image regions; or localize affective regions in images. However; they have not beenused for identifying specific objects in images. In this paper; we investigate whether it ispossible to assign image regions showing specific objects with tags describing these objectsby analyzing the users' gaze paths. To this end; we have conducted an experiment with 20subjects viewing 50 image-tag-pairs each. We have compared the tag-to-regionassignments for nine existing and four new fixation measures. In addition; we haveinvestigated the impact of extending region boundaries; weighting small image regions; andthe number of subjects viewing the images.

Research on events in computer science,Ansgar Scherp,Humans think in terms of events and objects. Events provide a natural abstraction ofhappenings in the real world. Objects are participating in events. They can be living objectslike persons and non-living objects. The concept of events has a long history in foundationalsciences such as philosophy and linguistics. Computer science research first developedobject-based approaches and is now addressing the concept of events and building manyapplications that consider events at least as important as objects. Consequently; we findmany different solutions and approaches for modeling; detecting; and processing events. Inaddition; we find different applications that are based on events and make use of events.,Semantic ambient media intelligence. Salzburg; Austria,2009,1
Integrating Multimedia Metadata Standarts and Metadata Formats with the Multimedia Metadata Ontology: Method and Examples,Ansgar Scherp; Daniel Eißing; Carsten Saathoff,Summary: The Multimedia Metadata Ontology (M3O) provides a generic modelingframework for representing multimedia metadata. It has been designed based on ananalysis of existing metadata standards and metadata formats. The M3O abstracts from theexisting metadata standards and formats and provides generic modeling solutions forannotations; decompositions; and provenance of metadata. Being a generic modelingframework; the M3O aims at integrating the existing metadata standards and metadataformats rather than replacing them. This is in particular useful as today's multimediaapplications often need to combine and use more than one existing metadata standard ormetadata format at the same time. However; applying and specializing the abstract andpowerful M3O modeling framework in concrete application domains and integrating it with …,*,2007,1

Linked Open Data: Are we Drowning in Information and Starving for Know-How,Matthias Thimm; Thomas Gottron; Gerd Gröner; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract. Today's most popular means for publishing semantic information on the web is theparadigm of Linked Open Data (LOD) and the technologies behind the ResourceDescription Framework (RDF). The amount of openly available RDF data is drasticallyincreasing. However; even when considering ontological information such as RDF Schema;LOD is only little more than a collection of pieces of information. In this paper; we criticallyreview the current situation of LOD and have a bold look into the possible future of LinkedOpen Know-How. While today's LOD is mostly on representing factual information (whichcan also be called know-that) we also consider the possibility of representing proceduralinformation (know-how) in the future version of LOD. In our vision; by considering proceduralinformation in the same way as factual information; automatic knowledge acquisition and …,Proceedings of the Workshop “What will the Semantic Web look like,*,1
Using Deep Learning For Title-Based Semantic Subject Indexing To Reach Competitive Performance to Full-Text,Florian Mai; Lukas Galke; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract: For (semi-) automated subject indexing systems in digital libraries; it is often morepractical to use metadata such as the title of a publication instead of the full-text or theabstract. Therefore; it is desirable to have good text mining and text classification algorithmsthat operate well already on the title of a publication. So far; the classification performanceon titles is not competitive with the performance on the full-texts if the same number oftraining samples is used for training. However; it is much easier to obtain title data in largequantities and to use it for training than full-text data. In this paper; we investigate thequestion how models obtained from training on increasing amounts of title training datacompare to models from training on a constant number of full-texts. We evaluate thisquestion on a large-scale dataset from the medical domain (PubMed) and from …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.06717,2018,*

Keeping linked open data caches up-to-date by predicting the life-time of RDF triples,Chifumi Nishioka; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract Many Linked Open Data applications require fresh copies of RDF data at their localrepositories. Since RDF documents constantly change and those changes are notautomatically propagated to the LOD applications; it is important to regularly visit the RDFdocuments to refresh the local copies and keep them up-to-date. For this purpose; crawlingstrategies determine which RDF documents should be preferentially fetched. Traditionalcrawling strategies rely only on how an RDF document has been modified in the past. Incontrast; we predict on the triple level whether a change will occur in the future. We use theweekly snapshots of the DyLDO dataset as well as the monthly snapshots of the Wikidatadataset. First; we conduct an in-depth analysis of the life span of triples in RDF documents.Through the analysis; we identify which triples are stable and which are ephemeral.

Comparing Titles vs. Full-text for Multi-Label Classification of Scientific Papers and News Articles,Lukas Galke; Florian Mai; Alan Schelten; Dennis Brunsch; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract: Until today there has been no systematic comparison of how far documentclassification can be conducted using just the titles of the documents. However; methodsusing only the titles are very important since automated processing of titles has no legalbarriers. Copyright laws often hinder automated document classification on full-text andeven abstracts. In this paper; we compare established methods like Bayes; Rocchio; kNN;SVM; and logistic regression as well as recent methods like Learning to Rank and neuralnetworks to the multi-label document classification problem. We demonstrate thatclassifications solely using the documents' titles can be very good and very close to theclassification results using full-text.

Schema-level indices such as SchemEX allow for aconcise description of schema-related patterns on the LOD cloud. Extraction andconstruction of a SchemEX index can be implemented efficiently using a stream-basedapproach. In this project; we have implemented a large-scale information theoretic analysisof Linked Data based on SchemEX indices. The results provide interesting insights intocorrelation and redundancy of type and property information associated with entitiesmodelled on the LOD cloud. The findings have an impact on the design of schemalevelindices as well as applications which can benefit from the availability of patterns in schemainformation encoded in Linked Data.,HPI Future SOC Lab: Proceedings 2013,2015,*

The interviews are complemented by a paper-and-pencil questionnaire to obtain quantitative information and present mockups demonstratingthe user interface of a future multimedia search and retrieval engine.,Semantic Computing (ICSC); 2014 IEEE International Conference on,2014,*
Tagging-by-search: automatic image region labeling using gaze information obtained from image search,Tina Walber; Chantal Neuhaus; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract Labeled image regions provide very valuable information that can be used indifferent settings such as image search. The manual creation of region labels is a tedioustask. Fully automatic approaches lack understanding the image content sufficiently due tothe huge variety of depicted objects. Our approach benefits from the expected spread of eyetracking hardware and uses gaze information obtained from users performing image searchtasks to automatically label image regions. This allows to exploit the human capabilitiesregarding the visual perception of image content while performing daily routine tasks. In anexperiment with 23 participants; we show that it is possible to assign search terms to photoregions by means of gaze analysis with an average precision of 0.56 and an average F-measure of 0.38 over 361 photos. The participants performed different search tasks while …,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on Intelligent User Interfaces,2014,*
Will Linked Data Benefit from Inverse Link Traversal?,Stefan Scheglmann; Ansgar Scherp,ABSTRACT Query execution using link-traversal is a promising approach for retrieving andaccessing data on the web. However; this approach finds its limitation when it comes toquery patterns such as? s rdf: type ex: Employee; where one does not know the subject URI.Such queries are quite useful for different application needs. In this paper; we conduct anempirical analysis on the use of such patterns in SPARQL query logs. We present differentsolution approaches to extend the current Linked Open Data principles with the ability forinverse link traversal. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the differentapproaches.,LDOW,2014,*

Linking the Semantics Ecosystem with Semantics Derivation Rules for Multimedia Content,Ansgar Scherp,Abstract Multimedia content exhibits multiple semantics that is influenced by different factorslike time; contextual use; and personal background. With the semantics ecosystem; we findan elegant and high-level description of the different factors that influence the semantics ofmultimedia content. On the other hand; semantics derivation rules are a concrete means toextract and to derive semantics of multimedia content while authoring it. These rules aredirectly applicable in concrete applications and domains. Thus; there is a gap between thehigh-level ecosystem and the concrete semantics derivation rules. In this position paper; wepropose the use of an ontology-based description of events to combine the high-leveldescription of the semantics ecosystem with the concrete method of semantics derivation forpage-based multimedia presentations.,Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings,2009,*

Explicit and Implicit Schema Information on the Linked Open Data Cloud: JoinedForces or Antagonists?,Ansgar Scherp; Thomas Gottron; Malte Knauf; Stefan Scheglmann,Abstract Schema information about resources in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud can beprovided in a twofold way: it can be explicitly defined by attaching RDF types to theresources. Or it is provided implicitly via the definition of the resources' properties. In thispaper; we analyze the correlation between the two sources of schema information. To thisend; we have extracted schema information regarding the types and properties defined intwo datasets of different size. One dataset is a LOD crawl from TimBL's FOAF profile (11 Mio.triple) and the second is an extract from the Billion Triples Challenge 2011 dataset (500 Mio.triple). We have conducted an in depth analysis and have computed various entropymeasures as well as the mutual information encoded in this two manifestations of schemainformation.

Formal Integration of Individual Knowledge Work and Organizational Knowledge Work with the Core Ontology strukt,Daniel Eißing; Ansgar Scherp; Steffen Staab,Abstract. Expert-driven business process management is an established means forimproving efficiency of organizational knowledge work. Implicit procedural knowledge in theorganization is made explicit by defining processes. This approach is not applicable toindividual knowledge work due to its high complexity and variability. However; withoutexplicitly described processes there is no analysis and efficient communication of bestpractices of individual knowledge work within the organization. In addition; the activities ofthe individual knowledge work cannot be synchronized with the activities in theorganizational knowledge work. Solution to this problem is the semantic integration ofindividual knowledge work and organizational knowledge work by means of thepatternbased core ontology strukt.

Comparing a Grid-based vs. List-based Approach for Faceted Search of Social Media Data on Mobile Devices,Mark Schneider; Ansgar Scherp,ABSTRACT In this paper; we compare two approaches for exploring large; hierarchical dataspaces of social media data on mobile devices using facets. While the first approacharranges the facets in a 3x3 grid; the second approach makes use of a scrollable list offacets for exploring the data. We have conducted a between-group experiment of the twoapproaches with 24 subjects (20 male; 4 female) executing the same set of tasks of typicalmobile users' information needs. The results show that the grid-based approach requiressignificantly more clicks; but subjects need less time for completing the tasks. Furthermore; itshows that the additional clicks do not hamper the subjects' satisfaction. Thus; the resultssuggest that the grid-based approach is a better choice for faceted search on touchscreenmobile devices.

A Parameterized Formal Model to Flexibly Define Schema-level Indices for the Web of Data,T Blume; M Schulte-Althoff; T Gottron; A Scherp,Abstract Schema-level indices address many challenges that come with the growing size ofthe Web of Data. We argue that there is not a one-sizefits-all index for the Web of Data.Rather; a parameterized; formal model is needed that allows to quickly design; tailor; andcompare different schema-level indices. We provide the first formal model for schema-levelindices called FLuID. Our model is abstracted from existing indices. In addition; our modelprovides novel features such as aggregation over owl: sameAs as well as RDFS inferencing.Indices defined with FLuID can be efficiently computed in O (n). We implemented the FLuIDmodel following an existing stream-based schema computation approach for the Web ofData. We empirically show that indeed different index models are needed for differentinformation needs; datasets; and space requirements.,*,*,*
Analyzing the Evolution of Vocabulary Terms and their Impact on the LOD Cloud,Mohammad Abdel-Qader; Ansgar Scherp; Iacopo Vagliano,Abstract. Vocabularies are used for modeling data in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) like theLinked Open Data Cloud and Wikidata. During their lifetime; vocabularies are subject tochanges. New terms are coined; while existing terms are modified or deprecated. We firstquantify the amount and frequency of changes in vocabularies. Subsequently; weinvestigate to which extend and when the changes are adopted in the evolution of KGs. Weconduct our experiments on three large-scale KGs for which timestamped information isavailable; namely the Billion Triples Challenge datasets; Dynamic Linked Data Observatorydataset; and Wikidata. Our results show that the change frequency of terms is rather low; butcan have high impact due to the large amount of distributed graph data on the web.Furthermore; not all coined terms are used and most of the deprecated terms are still …,*,*,*

Schema-Level Patterns and Learning to Rank for Linked Data Vocabulary Term Recommendations,Johann Schaible; Thomas Gottron; Ansgar Scherp,Abstract. Deciding which vocabularies to reuse when modeling data as Linked Open Data isfar from trivial. It includes searching for vocabulary terms; ie; classes and properties; anddeciding whether they are appropriate for reuse or not. We propose a novel vocabulary termrecommendation approach that suggests the Linked Data engineer to reuse vocabularyterms that are actively used on the Linked Open Data cloud. For recommending appropriatevocabulary terms; we take into consideration parts of the already created data model. Theterms are ranked using established learning to rank approaches that make use of severaldifferent features. To evaluate our approach; we conduct a 10-fold cross-validation usingthree different learning to rank approaches and apply them in 21 different recommendationscenarios.

A Common Model of Events based on DOLCE,Ansgar Scherp; Thomas Franz; Carsten Saathoff; Steffen Staab,The explicit modeling of events and event-based systems are gaining widespread attentionby research and industry. The event detection; clustering; and annotation in such systems isand will be realized in many different software components and proprietary solutions using alarge variety of internal data models for events; making their integration a challenging task.Existing solutions typically focus on the technical level of event management. In this paper;we present an approach for describing events on domain-level and as occurrences in thereal world; respectively. This is important in a variety of domains such as emergencyresponse; sports; news; law; and others. Events may be very complex and linked to a varietyof modeling aspects. This makes the communication between different event-based systemsand components a challenging task. In particular; considering the ad-hoc and …,*,*,*
