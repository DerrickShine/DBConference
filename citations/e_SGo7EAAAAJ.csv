Iontophoretic Drug Delivery for the Treatment of Scars,Prashanth Manda; Muralikrishnan Angamuthu; Shobharani R Hiremath; Vijayasankar Raman; S Narasimha Murthy,ABSTRACT Topical treatment of hypertrophic scars is challenging because of poorpenetrability of drugs into the scar tissue. The objective of the study was to investigate theeffectiveness of iontophoresis to deliver medicaments across the scar epidermis. Initially;biophysical studies were performed to investigate the differences between scar and normalskin epidermis obtained from cadaver. In case of scar skin epidermis; the transepidermalwater loss was not significantly different from the normal skin epidermis; whereas theelectrical resistivity was significantly higher. The passive permeation flux of sodiumfluorescein was approximately one-third of that across the normal skin epidermis. Scanningelectron microscopy studies revealed that the two membranes were alike except that thescar skin epidermis lacked follicles.

New and unusual forms of calcium oxalate raphide crystals in the plant kingdom,Vijayasankar Raman; Harry T Horner; Ikhlas A Khan,Abstract Calcium oxalate crystals in higher plants occur in five major forms namely raphides;styloids; prisms; druses and crystal sand. The form; shape and occurrence of calciumoxalate crystals in plants are species-and tissue-specific; hence the presence or absence ofa particular type of crystal can be used as a taxonomic character. So far; four different typesof needle-like raphide crystals have been reported in plants. The present work describes twonew and unusual forms of raphide crystals from the tubers of Dioscorea polystachya—six-sided needles with pointed ends (Type V) and four-sided needles with beveled ends (TypeVI). Both of these new types of needles are distinct from the other four types by each havinga surrounding membrane that envelopes a bundle of 10–20 closely packed thin crystallinesheets. The previously known four types of needles have solid or homogenous crystalline …,Journal of plant research,2014,13

Thedrug/polymer physical mixtures were extruded as rods with a co-rotating twin-screw extruderand then pelletized. The chemical interaction between EFZ and Eudragit E PO wasdetermined using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Solid-statecharacterization of EFZ in the Eudragit E PO matrix was carried out using differentialscanning calorimetry (DSC); Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) and Scanning electronmicroscopy (SEM) techniques. The solubility of EFZ was improved significantly due to itsconversion into a more water-soluble amorphous form. Drug load had a significant effect onEFZ release characteristics from the pellets.

The present study investigates the anatomy of the leaves and stems ofP. caldense by light and scanning electron microscopy in order to provide supporting datafor correct identification of the species. The leaves are hypostomatic; have a 2-layeredhypodermis; and posses pearl glands. The midrib shows a 'U'-shaped stele comprised ofabout ten collateral vascular bundles. The main anatomical marker of the stem is thepresence of a continuous sclerenchymatous sheath in the pith.

Male and female flowers occur in separate plants. Three types ofglandular trichomes namely; glandular stalked; glandular sessile and bulbous glandulartrichomes are found. Of these; glandular stalked trichomes are restricted to the floral bractsin pistillate plants and anthers in staminate plants. The other two types of glandulartrichomes are found in various parts including bracts; leaves; stems and petioles. Two typesof non-glandular trichomes namely; cystolith trichomes and slender covering trichomes; arepresent. Cystolith trichomes are primarily found on the adaxial leaf surface while the …,*,2017,*

Investigations on the Anatomy and Essential Oil Chemistry of Siberian Ginseng Leaves,CM Zhai; M Wang; V Raman; J Rehman; YH Meng; B Avula; YH Wang; ZK Tian; IA Khan,Eleutherococcus senticosus (Rupr. & Maxim.) Maxim. the Siberian ginseng; is a well-knownTraditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Its medicinal uses can be traced back to Qin and HanDynasty (221 BC). Its roots and stems have been used as medicine for their antioxidant; anti-inflammatory and anti-fatigue properties [1]. Due to over-harvesting for its roots and stems;the wild populations of the species are facing threat of extinction. In China; the use of rootshas now been regulated by the Government [2]. As a measure to protect the species; theleaves are being recommended as a substitution to the root and stem. Thus; scientific data isessential to support the medicinal use of E. senticosus leaves.The aim of the present workwas to study the morpho-anatomy of leaves and characterize the composition of theessential oil from the leaves.

Contributions to Morpho-Anatomy and Odor-Chemistry of 'Carrion Flower'(Amorphophallus titanum),V Raman; N Tabanca; B Demirci; IA Khan,The inflorescence of Amorphophallus titanum (Araceae) is the largest of its kind in the world.It appears and functions like a single flower hence it is often referred to as a'flower'. It iscalled as' carrion flower'or'corpse flower'due to its characteristically unpleasant rotting meat-like odor. A. titanum is a rare and endemic species. It blooms rarely and its blooming incultivation is even rarer. The present work illustrates detailed anatomy of the inflorescenceby light and scanning electron microscopy. Volatile compounds from different parts of theinflorescence were collected using a modified Headspace-Solid Phase Microextractiontechnique and their chemical components were analyzed by GC-MS.

It has traditionally been used to treaturinary tract infections and stomach troubles. It is widely marketed in the USA in variousforms as dietary supplements. Buchu used in commerce is mainly derived from Agathosmabetulina known as round-leaf or short buchu. However; leaves of Agathosma crenulata;which may contain high levels of pulegone in the essential oil; and other closely relatedspecies are often marketed as or used to adulterate buchu thus making the productpotentially unsafe for human consumption.

Comparative morpho-anatomy and HPTLC studies of leaves of Agathosma betulina and Agathosma crenulata,V Raman; S Sagi; AM Galal; B Avula; IA Khan,Buchu is one of the South Africa's best-known medicinal plants valued for its medicinal usesas diuretic; antiseptic and stimulant tonic. It is also widely used against urinary tractinfections and stomach troubles. In the USA; buchu is popularly consumed as tea and alsoused as a dietary supplement. The strongly aromatic buchu leaf is mainly derived fromAgathosma betulina (syn. Barosma betulina); known as round-leaf buchu or short buchu.However; commercial buchus are often derived also from A. crenulata (oval-leaf buchu). Thetwo species have different chemical profiles; and the oil of A. crenulata has a high level ofpulegone; a potentially toxic component that renders the oil unsuitable for humanconsumption. Therefore; correct identification and differentiation of buchu is crucial.
