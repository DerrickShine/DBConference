Towards domain-independent information extraction from web tables,Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Paul Bohunsky; Marcus Herzog; Bernhard Krüpl; Bernhard Pollak,Traditionally; information extraction from web tables has focused on small; more or less homogeneouscorpora; often based on assumptions about the use of <table> tags. A multitude of different HTMLimplementations of web tables make these approaches difficult to scale. In this paper; we approachthe problem of domain-independent information extraction from web tables by shifting our attentionfrom the tree-based representation of web pages to a variation of the two-dimensional visualbox model used by web browsers to display the information on the screen. The thereby obtainedtopological and style information allows us to fill the gap created by missing domain-specificknowledge about content and table templates. We believe that; in a future step; this approachcan become the basis for a new way of large-scale knowledge acquisition from the current “VisualWeb.” … Categories and Subject Descriptors: H.2.8 [Database Management]: Database …,Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web,2007,248
The complexity of causality and responsibility for query answers and non-answers,Alexandra Meliou; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Katherine F Moore; Dan Suciu,Abstract An answer to a query has a well-defined lineage expression (alternatively calledhow-provenance) that explains how the answer was derived. Recent work has also shownhow to compute the lineage of a non-answer to a query. However; the cause of an answer ornon-answer is a more subtle notion and consists; in general; of only a fragment of thelineage. In this paper; we adapt Halpern; Pearl; and Chockler's recent definitions of causalityand responsibility to define the causes of answers and non-answers to queries; and theirdegree of responsibility. Responsibility captures the notion of degree of causality and servesto rank potentially many causes by their relative contributions to the effect. Then; we studythe complexity of computing causes and responsibilities for conjunctive queries. It is knownthat computing causes is NP-complete in general. Our first main result shows that all …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,118
A case for a collaborative query management system,Nodira Khoussainova; Magda Balazinska; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; YongChul Kwon; Dan Suciu,Abstract: Over the past 40 years; database management systems (DBMSs) have evolved toprovide a sophisticated variety of data management capabilities. At the same time; tools formanaging queries over the data have remained relatively primitive. One reason for this isthat queries are typically issued through applications. They are thus debugged once and re-used repeatedly. This mode of interaction; however; is changing. As scientists (and others)store and share increasingly large volumes of data in data centers; they need the ability toanalyze the data by issuing exploratory queries. In this paper; we argue that; in these newsettings; data management systems must provide powerful query management capabilities;from query browsing to automatic query recommendations. We first discuss the requirementsfor a collaborative query management system. We outline an early system architecture …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0909.1778,2009,75
Causality in databases,Alexandra Meliou; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Joseph Y Halpern; Christoph Koch; Katherine F Moore; Dan Suciu,Abstract Provenance is often used to validate data; by verifying its origin and explaining itsderivation. When searching for “causes” of tuples in the query results or in generalobservations; the analysis of lineage becomes an essential tool for providing suchjustifications. However; lineage can quickly grow very large; limiting its immediate use forproviding intuitive explanations to the user. The formal notion of causality is a more refinedconcept that identifies causes for observations based on user-defined criteria; and thatassigns to them gradual degrees of responsibility based on their respective contributions. Inthis paper; we initiate a discussion on causality in databases; give some simple definitions;and motivate this formalism through a number of example applications.,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2010,73
Using visual cues for extraction of tabular data from arbitrary HTML documents,Bernhard Krüpl; Marcus Herzog; Wolfgang Gatterbauer,Abstract We describe a method to extract tabular data from web pages. Rather than justanalyzing the DOM tree; we also exploit visual cues in the rendered version of the documentto extract data from tables which are not explicitly marked with an HTML table element. Todetect tables; we rely on a variant of the well-known XY cut algorithm as used in the OCRcommunity. We implemented the system by directly accessing Mozilla's box model thatcontains the positional data for all HTML elements of a given web page.,Special interest tracks and posters of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web,2005,60

Believe it or not: adding belief annotations to databases,Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Magdalena Balazinska; Nodira Khoussainova; Dan Suciu,Abstract We propose a database model that allows users to annotate data with beliefstatements. Our motivation comes from scientific database applications where a communityof users is working together to assemble; revise; and curate a shared data repository. As thecommunity accumulates knowledge and the database content evolves over time; it maycontain conflicting information and members can disagree on the information it should store.For example; Alice may believe that a tuple should be in the database; whereas Bobdisagrees. He may also insert the reason why he thinks Alice believes the tuple should be inthe database; and explain what he thinks the correct tuple should be instead. We propose aformal model for Belief Databases that interprets users' annotations as belief statements.These annotations can refer both to the base data and to other annotations. We give a …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,42

Why so? or why no? functional causality for explaining query answers,Alexandra Meliou; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Katherine F Moore; Dan Suciu,Abstract: In this paper; we propose causality as a unified framework to explain queryanswers and non-answers; thus generalizing and extending several previously proposedapproaches of provenance and missing query result explanations. We develop ourframework starting from the well-studied definition of actual causes by Halpern and Pearl.After identifying some undesirable characteristics of the original definition; we proposefunctional causes as a refined definition of causality with several desirable properties. Theseproperties allow us to apply our notion of causality in a database context and apply ituniformly to define the causes of query results and their individual contributions in severalways:(i) we can model both provenance as well as non-answers;(ii) we can defineexplanations as either data in the input relations or relational operations in a query plan …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0912.5340,2009,41
Tracing data errors with view-conditioned causality,Alexandra Meliou; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Suman Nath; Dan Suciu,Abstract A surprising query result is often an indication of errors in the query or theunderlying data. Recent work suggests using causal reasoning to find explanations for thesurprising result. In practice; however; one often has multiple queries and/or multipleanswers; some of which may be considered correct and others unexpected. In this paper; wefocus on determining the causes of a set of unexpected results; possibly conditioned onsome prior knowledge of the correctness of another set of results. We call this problem View-Conditioned Causality. We adapt the definitions of causality and responsibility for the case ofmultiple answers/views and provide a non-trivial algorithm that reduces the problem offinding causes and their responsibility to a satisfiability problem that can be solved withexisting tools. We evaluate both the accuracy and effectiveness of our approach on a real …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,38
Self-Driving Database Management Systems.,Andrew Pavlo; Gustavo Angulo; Joy Arulraj; Haibin Lin; Jiexi Lin; Lin Ma; Prashanth Menon; Todd C Mowry; Matthew Perron; Ian Quah; Siddharth Santurkar; Anthony Tomasic; Skye Toor; Dana Van Aken; Ziqi Wang; Yingjun Wu; Ran Xian; Tieying Zhang,ABSTRACT In the last two decades; both researchers and vendors have built advisory toolsto assist database administrators (DBAs) in various aspects of system tuning and physicaldesign. Most of this previous work; however; is incomplete because they still require humansto make the final decisions about any changes to the database and are reactionarymeasures that fix problems after they occur. What is needed for a truly “self-driving”database management system (DBMS) is a new architecture that is designed forautonomous operation. This is different than earlier attempts because all aspects of thesystem are controlled by an integrated planning component that not only optimizes thesystem for the current workload; but also predicts future workload trends so that the systemcan prepare itself accordingly. With this; the DBMS can support all of the previous tuning …,CIDR,2017,37
QueryViz: helping users understand SQL queries and their patterns,Jonathan Danaparamita; Wolfgang Gatterbauer,Abstract We present QueryViz; a novel visualization tool for SQL queries that reduces thetime needed to read and understand existing queries. It targets two principal audiences:(i)users who often issue the same or similar queries and who need to quickly browse througha repository of existing queries; and (ii) novices that try to familiarize themselves with thelogic behind alternative patterns of SQL queries. QueryViz uses as input only two strings: thedatabase schema and the SQL query. It can thus serve as light-weight add-on to existingdatabase systems and is also available via an online interface at http://queryviz. com.,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2011,34
Reverse data management,Alexandra Meliou; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Dan Suciu,ABSTRACT Database research mainly focuses on forward-moving data flows: source data issubjected to transformations and evolves through queries; aggregations; and viewdefinitions to form a new target instance; possibly with a different schema. This ForwardParadigm underpins most data management tasks today; such as querying; data integration;data mining; etc. We contrast this forward processing with Reverse Data Management(RDM); where the action needs to be performed on the input data; on behalf of desiredoutcomes in the output data. Some data management tasks already fall under this paradigm;for example updates through views; data generation; data cleaning and repair. RDM is; bynecessity; conceptually more difficult to define; and computationally harder to achieve.Today; however; as increasingly more of the available data is derived from other data …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,29
Linearized and single-pass belief propagation,Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Stephan Günnemann; Danai Koutra; Christos Faloutsos,Abstract How can we tell when accounts are fake or real in a social network? And how canwe tell which accounts belong to liberal; conservative or centrist users? Often; we cananswer such questions and label nodes in a network based on the labels of their neighborsand appropriate assumptions of homophily (" birds of a feather flock together") or heterophily(" opposites attract"). One of the most widely used methods for this kind of inference is BeliefPropagation (BP) which iteratively propagates the information from a few nodes with explicitlabels throughout a network until convergence. A well-known problem with BP; however; isthat there are no known exact guarantees of convergence in graphs with loops. This paperintroduces Linearized Belief Propagation (LinBP); a linearization of BP that allows a closed-form solution via intuitive matrix equations and; thus; comes with exact convergence …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,25
Data conflict resolution using trust mappings,Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Dan Suciu,Abstract In massively collaborative projects such as scientific or community databases; usersoften need to agree or disagree on the content of individual data items. On the other hand;trust relationships often exist between users; allowing them to accept or reject other users'beliefs by default. As those trust relationships become complex; however; it becomes difficultto define and compute a consistent snapshot of the conflicting information. Previoussolutions to a related problem; the update reconciliation problem; are dependent on theorder in which the updates are processed and; therefore; do not guarantee a globallyconsistent snapshot. This paper proposes the first principled solution to the automaticconflict resolution problem in a community database. Our semantics is based on the certaintuples of all stable models of a logic program. While evaluating stable models in general …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,25
Visual structure-based web page clustering and retrieval,Paul Bohunsky; Wolfgang Gatterbauer,Abstract Clustering and retrieval of web pages dominantly relies on analyzing either thecontent of individual web pages or the link structure between them. Some literature alsosuggests to use the structure of web pages; notably the structure of its DOM tree. However;little work considers the visual structure of web pages for clustering. In this paper (i) wemotivate visual structure-based web page clustering and retrieval for a number ofapplications;(ii) we formalize a visual box model-based representation of web pages thatsupports new metrics of visual similarity; and (iii) we report on our current work on evaluatinghuman perception of visual similarity of web pages and applying the learned visual similarityfeatures to web page clustering and retrieval.,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,25
Integrating and ranking uncertain scientific data,Landon Detwiler; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Brent Louie; Dan Suciu; Peter Tarczy-Hornoch,Mediator-based data integration systems resolve exploratory queries by joining dataelements across sources. In the presence of uncertainties; such multiple expansions canquickly lead to spurious connections and incorrect results. The BioRank project investigatesformalisms for modeling uncertainty during scientific data integration and for rankinguncertain query results. Our motivating application is protein function prediction. In thispaper we show that:(i) explicit modeling of uncertainties as probabilities increases our abilityto predict less-known or previously unknown functions (though it does not improvepredicting the well-known). This suggests that probabilistic uncertainty models offer utility forscientific knowledge discovery;(ii) small perturbations in the input probabilities tend toproduce only minor changes in the quality of our result rankings.

Session-based browsing for more effective query reuse,Nodira Khoussainova; YongChul Kwon; Wei-Ting Liao; Magdalena Balazinska; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Dan Suciu,Scientists today are able to generate and collect data at an unprecedented scale [1]. Af-terwards; scientists analyze and explore these datasets. Composing SQL queries; how-ever; is a significant challenge for scientists because most are not database experts. In thiswork; we leverage the collaborative environment that many scientists work in; which often includesa shared database with many scientists asking queries over it. As such; we utilize the collectiveknowledge of all the users by providing new users with access to a log of past queries; whichcan be used as starting points for writing new queries. However; navigating a large log of queriescan be difficult and overwhelming. In this paper; we introduce the Smart Query Browser(SQB) system. SQB supports efficient retrieval of relevant queries using what we callsession-based browsing.

Approximate lifted inference with probabilistic databases,Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Dan Suciu,Abstract This paper proposes a new approach for approximate evaluation of# P-hardqueries with probabilistic databases. In our approach; every query is evaluated entirely inthe database engine by evaluating a fixed number of query plans; each providing an upperbound on the true probability; then taking their minimum. We provide an algorithm that takesinto account important schema information to enumerate only the minimal necessary plansamong all possible plans. Importantly; this algorithm is a strict generalization of all knownresults of PTIME self-join-free conjunctive queries: A query is safe if and only if our algorithmreturns one single plan. We also apply three relational query optimization techniques toevaluate all minimal safe plans very fast. We give a detailed experimental evaluation of ourapproach and; in the process; provide a new way of thinking about the value of …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,16

The complexity of resilience and responsibility for self-join-free conjunctive queries,Cibele Freire; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Neil Immerman; Alexandra Meliou,Abstract Several research thrusts in the area of data management have focused onunderstanding how changes in the data affect the output of a view or standing query.Example applications are explaining query results; propagating updates through views; andanonymizing datasets. An important aspect of this analysis is the problem of deleting aminimum number of tuples from the input tables to make a given Boolean query false; whichwe refer to as" the resilience of a query." In this paper; we study the complexity of resiliencefor self-join-free conjunctive queries with arbitrary functional dependencies. The cornerstoneof our work is the novel concept of triads; a simple structural property of a query that leads tothe several dichotomy results we show in this paper.

The generality of the notion makes itapplicable in a variety of domains; including data warehousing [7]; curated databases [4];and various scientific applications. The recent introduction of causal reasoning in adatabase setting exploits provenance in ways that expand its applicability to more complexproblems; and establish new directions; making a step towards achieving provenance's fullpotential. In this paper we explore through a variety of examples how causality improves onprovenance information; discuss the challenges of building causality able systems; andpropose some new directions.,TaPP,2011,13
Fault-tolerant entity resolution with the crowd,Anja Gruenheid; Besmira Nushi; Tim Kraska; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Donald Kossmann,Abstract: In recent years; crowdsourcing is increasingly applied as a means to enhance dataquality. Although the crowd generates insightful information especially for complex problemssuch as entity resolution (ER); the output quality of crowd workers is often noisy. That is;workers may unintentionally generate false or contradicting data even for simple tasks. Thechallenge that we address in this paper is how to minimize the cost for task requesters whilemaximizing ER result quality under the assumption of unreliable input from the crowd. Forthat purpose; we first establish how to deduce a consistent ER solution from noisy workeranswers as part of the data interpretation problem. We then focus on the next-crowdsourceproblem which is to find the next task that maximizes the information gain of the ER result forthe minimal additional cost. We compare our robust data interpretation strategies to …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.00537,2015,11
Economic efficiency of decentralized unit commitment from a generator’s perspective,Wolfgang Gatterbauer,In this chapter; we study the optimal commitment of generation units in a decentralizedmarket from the perspective of an individual market participant. We start by comparing thetheoretic economic efficiencies of centralized and decentralized unit commitment (UC). Weprove that under certain circumstances and in contrast to current teaching; centralized UCcan lead to overall higher social welfare than decentralized UC; even in the case ofcomplete market information. We then closer explore a self-scheduling generator's ability tomaximize profit using only publicly available price forecasts. Deploying the dynamicprogramming formulation from section [*** Cross-reference Eric***]; we motivate the usageof fat tail Cauchy stochastic price models instead of the more commonly used Normaldistributions. Finally; we use a simple model to show how prices above marginal cost …,Engineering Electricity Services of the Future. Springer,2010,11

Web information extraction using eupeptic data in web tables,Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Bernhard Krüpl; Wolfgang Holzinger; Marcus Herzog,Abstract. By leveraging on the redundant information on the Web; we are building a Webinformation extraction system that concentrates on eupeptic data in Web tables. We use theterm eupeptic to describe such representations of information that allow for easyinterpretation of the subject–predicate–object nature of individual data items. The systemmimics a human approach to information gathering. It explicitly uses visual cues onrendered Web pages to locate tabular data; it uses keywords to identify relevant chunks ofdata that gets processed on a deeper level; and it expands its initial search to include morepages when it spots eupeptic data.,*,2005,11
Oblivious bounds on the probability of Boolean functions,Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Dan Suciu,Abstract This article develops upper and lower bounds for the probability of Booleanfunctions by treating multiple occurrences of variables as independent and assigning themnew individual probabilities. We call this approach dissociation and give an exactcharacterization of optimal oblivious bounds; that is; when the new probabilities are chosenindependently of the probabilities of all other variables. Our motivation comes from theweighted model counting problem (or; equivalently; the problem of computing the probabilityof a Boolean function); which is &num; P-hard in general. By performing severaldissociations; one can transform a Boolean formula whose probability is difficult to computeinto one whose probability is easy to compute; and which is guaranteed to provide an upperor lower bound on the probability of the original formula by choosing appropriate …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2014,10

Taking fixed operating costs into account; weshow that meeting decentralized performance objectives of the individual marketparticipants can lead to a lower efficiency than minimizing total operating cost in adecentralized way. This result concerns short-term optimization; and does not consider long-term investment issues. Next; the task of optimally self-scheduling generators to maximizeprofits in a deregulated electricity market is investigated from the standpoint of an individualmarket participant.

Querying provenance for ranking and recommending,Zachary G Ives; Andreas Haeberlen; Tao Feng; Wolfgang Gatterbauer,Abstract As has been frequently observed in the literature; there is a strong connectionbetween a derived data item's provenance and its authoritativeness; utility; relevance; orprobability. A standard way of obtaining a score for a derived tuple is by first assigningscores to the “base” tuples from which it is derived—then using the semantics of the queryand the score measure to derive a value for the tuple. This “provenance-enabled” scoringhas led to a variety of scenarios where tuples' intrinsic value is based on their provenance;independent of whatever other tuples exist in the data set.,*,2012,9
Databases will visualize queries too,Wolfgang Gatterbauer,ABSTRACT Visual Query Languages study ways to help users compose queries with visualmetaphors. Information Visualization studies automatic visualization techniques to helpusers understand and analyze data. Query Management focuses on ways to help usersmanage and re-use existing queries. We observe that there is a related research questionacross those three topics which has not received much attention; namely that of QueryVisualization: How to visually represent a query to help users quickly understand its intent?Here we argue that the involved challenges are still markedly different from those of theother three; that a solution can considerably improve the usability of DBMSs; and that thetopic is thus worthy of attention. We envision; that in a few years; there will be free; modular;and lightweight tools available that allow users to visualize and interpret their queries.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,9

Counterexamples to commonly held assumptions on unit commitment and market power assessment,Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Marija Ilić,Abstract This chapter revisits two commonly accepted assumptions about the economics ofderegulated electricity markets. It first disproves that; in theory and under the condition ofperfect information; decentralized and centralized unit commitment (UC) would lead to thesame power quantities traded and the same optimal social welfare. It then shows that agenerator owner's optimum bid sequence for an auction market is generally above marginalcost; even where absolutely no abuse of market power is involved.,*,2013,5
Rules of thumb for information acquisition from large and redundant data,Wolfgang Gatterbauer,Abstract We develop an abstract model of information acquisition from redundant data. Weassume a random sampling process from data which contain information with bias and areinterested in the fraction of information we expect to learn as function of (i) the sampledfraction (recall) and (ii) varying bias of information (redundancy distributions). We developtwo rules of thumb with varying robustness. We first show that; when information bias followsa Zipf distribution; the 80-20 rule or Pareto principle does surprisingly not hold; and werather expect to learn less than 40% of the information when randomly sampling 20% of theoverall data. We then analytically prove that for large data sets; randomized sampling frompower-law distributions leads to “truncated distributions” with the same power-law exponent.This second rule is very robust and also holds for distributions that deviate substantially …,European Conference on Information Retrieval,2011,5
Managing Structured Collections of Community Data.,Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Dan Suciu,ABSTRACT Data management is becoming increasingly social. We observe a new form ofinformation in such collaborative scenarios; where users contribute and reuse information;which resides neither in the base data nor in the schema information. This “superimposedstructure” derives partly from interaction within the community; and partly from therecombination of existing data. We argue that this triad of data; schema; and higher-orderstructure requires new data abstractions that–at the same time–must efficiently scale to verylarge community databases. In addition; data generated by the community exposes fourcharacteristics that make scalability especially difficult:(i) inconsistency; as different users orapplications have or require partially overlapping and contradicting views;(ii) non-monotonicity; as new information may be able to revoke previous information already built …,CIDR,2011,4

Default-all is dangerous!,Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Alexandra Meliou; Dan Suciu,Abstract We show that the default-all propagation scheme for database annotations isdangerous. Dangerous here means that it can propagate annotations to the query outputwhich are semantically irrelevant to the query the user asked. This is the result ofconsidering all relationally equivalent queries and returning the union of their where-provenance in an attempt to define a propagation scheme that is insensitive to queryrewriting. We propose an alternative query-rewrite-insensitive (QRI) where-provenancecalled minimal propagation. It is analogous to the minimal witness basis for whyprovenance;straight-forward to evaluate; and returns all relevant and only relevant annotations.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1105.4395,2011,3

Estimating required recall for successful knowledge acquisition from the web,Wolfgang Gatterbauer,Abstract Information on the Web is not only abundant but also redundant. This redundancyof information has an important consequence on the relation between the recall of aninformation gathering system and its capacity to harvest the core information of a certaindomain of knowledge.

Semi-supervised learning with heterophily,Wolfgang Gatterbauer,Abstract: We derive a family of linear inference algorithms that generalize existing graph-based label propagation algorithms by allowing them to propagate generalized assumptionsabout" attraction" or" compatibility" between classes of neighboring nodes (in particularthose that involve heterophily between nodes where" opposites attract"). We thus call thisformulation Semi-Supervised Learning with Heterophily (SSLH) and show how itgeneralizes and improves upon a recently proposed approach called Linearized BeliefPropagation (LinBP). Importantly; our framework allows us to reduce the problem ofestimating the relative compatibility between nodes from partially labeled graph to a simpleoptimization problem. The result is a very fast algorithm that--despite its simplicity--issurprisingly effective: we can classify unlabeled nodes within the same graph in the same …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1412.3100,2014,2

SQB: Session-based Query Browsing for More Effective Query Reuse,Nodira Khoussainova; Y Kwon; Wei-Ting Liao; Magdalena Balazinska; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Dan Suciu,Abstract. Scientists are generating more data than ever before and are increasingly puttingthat data (or corresponding metadata) inside a relational database accessible through SQL.Composing non-trivial SQL queries; however; is difficult. Just like code reuse; query reusecan facilitate and accelerate the task of composing new queries. A key challenge is how bestto facilitate this reuse. In this paper; we introduce Smart Query Browser (SQB); a tool forsearching and browsing through a repository of SQL queries. SQB applies the idea of aquery session to improve query browsing and reuse. Informally; a query session is a set ofqueries authored by a single user to achieve a specific information goal. To evaluate SQB;we conduct a user study with 16 users and find that SQB reduces the query composition timeby 57% compared with a traditional; unassisted query composition setting.,*,2011,1
New Scalable Methods for Ranking Students in the Presence of Misleading Questions,Gerdus Benadè; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Nam Ho-Nguyen; R Ravi,ABSTRACT We study the problem of ranking students by their abilities and questions bytheir qualities; solely based on responses to studentsourced multiple-choice questions. Thisapproach addresses the crucial problem of scaling automatic assessment of students to verylarge class sizes. Existing methods from learning science and Item Response Theory (IRT)have two problems:(1) they assume student responses obey a parameterized model and (2)they were designed for situations with trusted questions and hence suffer from higherinaccuracies in the presence of student-sourced questions that may be misleading.Furthermore; we observe empirically that the running time is quadratic in the number ofstudents. In this paper; we define an axiomatic framework for the requirements of goodranking algorithms; as well as a new model for simulating ill-posed questions. We marry …,*,2018,*
Conflict of Interest Declaration and Detection System in Heterogeneous Networks,Siyuan Wu; Sourav S Bhowmick; Wolfgang Gatterbauer,Abstract Peer review is the most critical process in evaluating an article to be accepted forpublication in an academic venue. When assigning a reviewer to evaluate an article; theassignment should be aware of conflicts of interest (COIs) such that the reviews are fair toeveryone. However; existing conference management systems simply ask reviewers andauthors to declare their explicit COIs through a plain search user interface guided by somesimple conflict rules. We argue that such declaration system is not enough to discover alllatent COI cases. In this work; we study a graphical declaration system that visualizes therelationships of authors and reviewers based on a heterogeneous co-authorship network.With the help of the declarations; we attempt to detect the latent COIs automatically based onthe meta-paths of a heterogeneous network.,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,*
Iterative Methods for Ranking Students with Noisy Questions,Gerdus Benade; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Nam Ho-Nguyen; R Ravi,Abstract We study the problem of ranking students by their abilities; solely based onresponses to studentsourced multiple-choice questions. This addresses the crucial problemof scaling automatic assessment of students to very large class sizes. Current state-of-the-artmethods (i) assume student responses obey a parameterized model;(ii) were designed forsituations with trusted questions; and (iii) are not scalable (we observe empirically that therunning time is quadratic in the number of students). In this paper; we define an axiomaticframework for robust ranking algorithms; as well as a new model for simulating ill-posedquestions. We marry ideas from work in truth discovery with properties from item responsetheory to devise several new algorithms with strong axiomatic guarantees and linearscalability. We prove that 'translation invariant'and 'anti-symmetric'ranking methods are …,*,2017,*
Beta Probabilistic Databases: A Scalable Approach to Belief Updating and Parameter Learning,Niccolo' Meneghetti; Oliver Kennedy; Wolfgang Gatterbauer,Abstract Tuple-independent probabilistic databases (TI-PDBs) handle uncertainty byannotating each tuple with a probability parameter; when the user submits a query; thedatabase derives the marginal probabilities of each output-tuple; assuming input-tuples arestatistically independent. While query processing in TI-PDBs has been studied extensively;limited research has been dedicated to the problems of updating or deriving the parametersfrom observations of query results. Addressing this problem is the main focus of this paper.We introduce Beta Probabilistic Databases (B-PDBs); a generalization of TI-PDBs designedto support both (i) belief updating and (ii) parameter learning in a principled and scalableway. The key idea of B-PDBs is to treat each parameter as a latent; Beta-distributed randomvariable. We show how this simple expedient enables both belief updating and parameter …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,*
Algorithms for Automatic Ranking of Participants and Tasks in an Anonymized Contest,Yang Jiao; R Ravi; Wolfgang Gatterbauer,Abstract We introduce a new set of problems based on the Chain Editing problem. In ourversion of Chain Editing; we are given a set of anonymous participants and a set ofundisclosed tasks that every participant attempts. For each participant-task pair; we knowwhether the participant has succeeded at the task or not. We assume that participants vary intheir ability to solve tasks; and that tasks vary in their difficulty to be solved. In an ideal world;stronger participants should succeed at a superset of tasks that weaker participants succeedat. Similarly; easier tasks should be completed successfully by a superset of participantswho succeed at harder tasks. In reality; it can happen that a stronger participant fails at atask that a weaker participants succeeds at. Our goal is to find a perfect nesting of theparticipant-task relations by flipping a minimum number of participant-task relations …,International Workshop on Algorithms and Computation,2017,*
The Linearization of Belief Propagation on Pairwise Markov Random Fields.,Wolfgang Gatterbauer,Abstract Belief Propagation (BP) is a widely used approximation for exact probabilisticinference in graphical models; such as Markov Random Fields (MRFs). In graphs withcycles; however; no exact convergence guarantees for BP are known; in general. For thecase when all edges in the MRF carry the same symmetric; doubly stochastic potential;recent works have proposed to approximate BP by linearizing the update equations arounddefault values; which was shown to work well for the problem of node classification. Thepresent paper generalizes all prior work and derives an approach that approximates loopyBP on any pairwise MRF with the problem of solving a linear equation system. Thisapproach combines exact convergence guarantees and a fast matrix implementation withthe ability to model heterogenous networks. Experiments on synthetic graphs with planted …,AAAI,2017,*
A Characterization of the Complexity of Resilience and Responsibility for Self-join-free Conjunctive Queries,Cibele Freire; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Neil Immerman; Alexandra Meliou,Abstract: Several research thrusts in the area of data management have focused onunderstanding how changes in the data affect the output of a view or standing query.Example applications are explaining query results; propagating updates through views; andanonymizing datasets. These applications usually rely on understanding how interventionsin a database impact the output of a query. An important aspect of this analysis is theproblem of deleting a minimum number of tuples from the input tables to make a givenBoolean query false. We refer to this problem as" the resilience of a query" and show itsconnections to the well-studied problems of deletion propagation and causal responsibility.In this paper; we study the complexity of resilience for self-join-free conjunctive queries; andalso make several contributions to previous known results for the problems of deletion …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1507.00674,2015,*

usenix conference policies,Zachary G Ives; Andreas Haeberlen; Tao Feng; Wolfgang Gatterbauer,Abstract: As has been frequently observed in the literature; there is a strong connectionbetween a derived data item's provenance and its authoritativeness; utility; relevance; orprobability. A standard way of obtaining a score for a derived tuple is by first assigningscores to the “base” tuples from which it is derived—then using the semantics of the queryand the score measure to derive a value for the tuple. This “provenance-enabled” scoringhas led to a variety of scenarios where tuples' intrinsic value is based on their provenance;independent of whatever other tuples exist in the data set.,*,2012,*
