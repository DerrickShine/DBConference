VisTrails: visualization meets data management,Steven P Callahan; Juliana Freire; Emanuele Santos; Carlos E Scheidegger; Cláudio T Silva; Huy T Vo,Abstract Scientists are now faced with an incredible volume of data to analyze. Tosuccessfully analyze and validate various hypothesis; it is necessary to pose severalqueries; correlate disparate data; and create insightful visualizations of both the simulatedprocesses and observed phenomena. Often; insight comes from comparing the results ofmultiple visualizations. Unfortunately; today this process is far from interactive and containsmany error-prone and time-consuming tasks. As a result; the generation and maintenance ofvisualizations is a major bottleneck in the scientific process; hindering both the ability tomine scientific data and the actual use of the data. The VisTrails system represents our initialattempt to improve the scientific discovery process and reduce the time to insight. InVisTrails; we address the problem of visualization from a data management perspective …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,474
Vistrails: Enabling interactive multiple-view visualizations,Louis Bavoil; Steven P Callahan; Patricia J Crossno; Juliana Freire; Carlos E Scheidegger; Cláudio T Silva; Huy T Vo,VisTrails is a new system that enables interactive multiple-view visualizations by simplifyingthe creation and maintenance of visualization pipelines; and by optimizing their execution. Itprovides a general infrastructure that can be combined with existing visualization systemsand libraries. A key component of VisTrails is the visualization trail (vistrail); a formalspecification of a pipeline. Unlike existing dataflow-based systems; in VisTrails there is aclear separation between the specification of a pipeline and its execution instances. Thisseparation enables powerful scripting capabilities and provides a scalable mechanism forgenerating a large number of visualizations. VisTrails also leverages the vistrail specificationto identify and avoid redundant operations. This optimization is especially useful whileexploring multiple visualizations. When variations of the same pipeline need to be …,Visualization; 2005. VIS 05. IEEE,2005,335
Managing rapidly-evolving scientific workflows,Juliana Freire; Cláudio T Silva; Steven P Callahan; Emanuele Santos; Carlos E Scheidegger; Huy T Vo,Abstract We give an overview of VisTrails; a system that provides an infrastructure forsystematically capturing detailed provenance and streamlining the data exploration process.A key feature that sets VisTrails apart from previous visualization and scientific workflowsystems is a novel action-based mechanism that uniformly captures provenance for dataproducts and workflows used to generate these products. This mechanism not only ensuresreproducibility of results; but it also simplifies data exploration by allowing scientists to easilynavigate through the space of workflows and parameter settings for an exploration task.,International Provenance and Annotation Workshop,2006,267
Visual exploration of big spatio-temporal urban data: A study of new york city taxi trips,Nivan Ferreira; Jorge Poco; Huy T Vo; Juliana Freire; Cláudio T Silva,As increasing volumes of urban data are captured and become available; new opportunitiesarise for data-driven analysis that can lead to improvements in the lives of citizens throughevidence-based decision making and policies. In this paper; we focus on a particularlyimportant urban data set: taxi trips. Taxis are valuable sensors and information associatedwith taxi trips can provide unprecedented insight into many different aspects of city life; fromeconomic activity and human behavior to mobility patterns. But analyzing these datapresents many challenges. The data are complex; containing geographical and temporalcomponents in addition to multiple variables associated with each trip. Consequently; it ishard to specify exploratory queries and to perform comparative analyses (eg; comparedifferent regions over time). This problem is compounded due to the size of the data-there …,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,2013,235

To this end; a functional magneticresonance imaging workflow was defined; which participants had to either simulate or run inorder to produce some provenance representation; from which a set of identified querieshad to be implemented and executed. Sixteen teams responded to the challenge; andsubmitted their inputs. In this paper; we present the challenge workflow and queries; andsummarize the participants' contributions.

Managing the evolution of dataflows with vistrails,Steven P Callahan; Juliana Freire; Emanuele Santos; Carlos Eduardo Scheidegger; Claudio T Silva; Huy T Vo,Scientists are now faced with an incredible volume of data to analyze. To successfullyanalyze and validate various hypotheses; it is necessary to pose several queries; correlatedisparate data; and create insightful visualizations of both the simulated processes andobserved phenomena. Data exploration through visualization requires scientists to gothrough several steps. In essence; they need to assemble complex workflows that consist ofdataset selection; specification of series of operations that need to be applied to the data;and the creation of appropriate visual representations; before they can finally view andanalyze the results. Often; insight comes from comparing the results of multiplevisualizations that are created during the data exploration process.,Data Engineering Workshops; 2006.

Querying and creating visualizations by analogy,Carlos Scheidegger; Huy Vo; David Koop; Juliana Freire; Claudio Silva,While there have been advances in visualization systems; particularly in multi-viewvisualizations and visual exploration; the process of building visualizations remains a majorbottleneck in data exploration. We show that provenance metadata collected during thecreation of pipelines can be reused to suggest similar content in related visualizations andguide semi-automated changes. We introduce the idea of query-by-example in the context ofan ensemble of visualizations; and the use of analogies as first-class operations in a systemto guide scalable interactions. We describe an implementation of these techniques inVisTrails; a publicly-available; open-source system.,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,2007,135
Tackling the provenance challenge one layer at a time,Carlos Scheidegger; David Koop; Emanuele Santos; Huy Vo; Steven Callahan; Juliana Freire; Cláudio Silva,Abstract VisTrails is a new workflow and provenance management system that providessupport for scientific data exploration and visualization. Whereas workflows have beentraditionally used to automate repetitive tasks; for applications that are exploratory in nature;change is the norm. VisTrails uses a new change-based provenance mechanism; whichwas designed to handle rapidly evolving workflows. It uniformly and automatically capturesprovenance information for data products and for the evolution of the workflows used togenerate these products. In this paper; we describe how the VisTrails provenance data areorganized in layers and present a first approach for querying this data that we developed totackle the Provenance Challenge queries.

These techniques are implemented in VisTrails; an open-source provenance-enabled scientific work flow system that can be combined with a widerange of tools; libraries; and visualization systems. We will show di erent scenarios wherethese techniques can be used to simplify the notoriously hard tasks of creating and refiningwork flows.,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,110
Streaming simplification of tetrahedral meshes,Huy T Vo; Steven P Callahan; Peter Lindstrom; Valerio Pascucci; Cláudio T Silva,Unstructured tetrahedral meshes are commonly used in scientific computing to representscalar; vector; and tensor fields in three dimensions. Visualization of these meshes can bedifficult to perform interactively due to their size and complexity. By reducing the size of thedata; we can accomplish real-time visualization necessary for scientific analysis. Wepropose a two-step approach for streaming simplification of large tetrahedral meshes. Ouralgorithm arranges the data on disk in a streaming; I/O-efficient format that allows coherentaccess to the tetrahedral cells. A quadric-based simplification is sequentially performed onsmall portions of the mesh in-core. Our output is a coherent streaming mesh which facilitatesfuture processing. Our technique is fast; produces high quality approximations; and operatesout-of-core to process meshes too large for main memory,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,2007,57
Parallel visualization on large clusters using MapReduce,Huy T Vo; Jonathan Bronson; Brian Summa; Joao LD Comba; Juliana Freire; Bill Howe; Valerio Pascucci; Cláudio T Silva,Large-scale visualization systems are typically designed to efficiently “push” datasetsthrough the graphics hardware. However; exploratory visualization systems are increasinglyexpected to support scalable data manipulation; restructuring; and querying capabilities inaddition to core visualization algorithms. We posit that new emerging abstractions forparallel data processing; in particular computing clouds; can be leveraged to support large-scale data exploration through visualization. In this paper; we take a first step in evaluatingthe suitability of the MapReduce framework to implement large-scale visualizationtechniques.

An executable paper provides more informationfor computational experiments and results than the text; tables; and figures of standardpapers. Executable papers can bundle computational content that allow readers andreviewers to interact; validate; and explore experiments. By including such content; authorsfacilitate future discoveries by lowering the barrier to reproducing and extending results.

The more the merrier: Efficient multi-source graph traversal,Manuel Then; Moritz Kaufmann; Fernando Chirigati; Tuan-Anh Hoang-Vu; Kien Pham; Alfons Kemper; Thomas Neumann; Huy T Vo,Abstract Graph analytics on social networks; Web data; and communication networks hasbeen widely used in a plethora of applications. Many graph analytics algorithms are basedon breadth-first search (BFS) graph traversal; which is not only time-consuming for largedatasets but also involves much redundant computation when executed multiple times fromdifferent start vertices. In this paper; we propose Multi-Source BFS (MS-BFS); an algorithmthat is designed to run multiple concurrent BFSs over the same graph on a single CPU corewhile scaling up as the number of cores increases. MS-BFS leverages the properties ofsmall-world networks; which apply to many real-world graphs; and enables efficient graphtraversal that:(i) shares common computation across concurrent BFSs;(ii) greatly reduces thenumber of random memory accesses; and (iii) does not incur synchronization costs.

Integrating predictive analytics and social media,Yafeng Lu; Robert Krüger; Dennis Thom; Feng Wang; Steffen Koch; Thomas Ertl; Ross Maciejewski,A key analytical task across many domains is model building and exploration for predictiveanalysis. Data is collected; parsed and analyzed for relationships; and features are selectedand mapped to estimate the response of a system under exploration. As social media datahas grown more abundant; data can be captured that may potentially represent behavioralpatterns in society. In turn; this unstructured social media data can be parsed and integratedas a key factor for predictive intelligence. In this paper; we present a framework for thedevelopment of predictive models utilizing social media data.

Recent hardware advancements have greatlyincreased the levels of parallelism available with all indications showing this trend willcontinue in the future. Existing visualization dataflow systems have attempted to takeadvantage of these new resources; though they still have a number of limitations whendeployed on shared memory multi-core architectures. Ideally; visualization systems shouldbe built on top of a parallel dataflow scheme that can optimally utilize CPUs and assignresources adaptively to pipeline elements.

Rendering arbitrarily large datasets has been an active area ofresearch for many years. However; the techniques required for polygonal data do notdirectly apply to the more complex problem of unstructured grids. In this paper; we describethe data structures and algorithms necessary to store large datasets on disk; keep an activeportion of the dataset in main memory; and render visible regions to one or more displays.Our system leverages a combination of out-of-core data management; distributed rendering;hardware-accelerated volume rendering; and dynamic level-of-detail. On a commodity PC;our system can preprocess a dataset consisting of about 36 million tetrahedra in about anhour and can render it interactively with one or more PCs.,EGPGV,2007,17
Urbane: A 3d framework to support data driven decision making in urban development,Nivan Ferreira; Marcos Lage; Harish Doraiswamy; Huy Vo; Luc Wilson; Heidi Werner; Muchan Park; Cláudio Silva,Architects working with developers and city planners typically rely on experience; precedentand data analyzed in isolation when making decisions that impact the character of a city.These decisions are critical in enabling vibrant; sustainable environments but must alsonegotiate a range of complex political and social forces. This requires those shaping thebuilt environment to balance maximizing the value of a new development with its impact onthe character of a neighborhood. As a result architects are focused on two issues throughoutthe decision making process: a) what defines the character of a neighborhood? and b) howwill a new development change its neighborhood? In the first; character can be influencedby a variety of factors and understanding the interplay between diverse data sets is crucial;including safety; transportation access; school quality and access to entertainment.

A scalable approach for data-driven taxi ride-sharing simulation,Masayo Ota; Huy Vo; Claudio Silva; Juliana Freire,As urban population grows; cities face many challenges related to transportation; resourceconsumption; and the environment. Ride sharing has been proposed as an effectiveapproach to reduce traffic congestion; gasoline consumption; and pollution. Despite greatpromise; researchers and policy makers lack adequate tools to assess tradeoffs and benefitsof various ride-sharing strategies. Existing approaches either make unrealistic modelingassumptions or do not scale to the sizes of existing data sets. In this paper; we propose areal-time; data-driven simulation framework that supports the efficient analysis of taxi ridesharing. By modeling taxis and trips as distinct entities; our framework is able to simulate arich set of realistic scenarios. At the same time; by providing a comprehensive set ofparameters; we are able to study the taxi ride-sharing problem from different angles …,Big Data (Big Data); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,13
Using provenance to streamline data exploration through visualization,Steven P Callahan; Juliana Freire; Emanuele Santos; Carlos E Scheidegger; Claudio T Silva; Huy T Vo,Abstract Scientists are faced with increasingly larger volumes of data to analyze. To analyzeand validate various hypotheses; they need to create insightful visual representations ofboth observed data and simulated processes. Often; insight comes from comparing multiplevisualizations. But data exploration through visualization requires scientists to assemblecomplex workflows—pipelines consisting of sequences of operations that transform the datainto appropriate visual representations—and today; this process contains many error-proneand time-consuming tasks. We show how a new action-based model for capturing andmaintaining detailed provenance of the visualization process can be used to streamline thedata exploration process and reduce the time to insight.

From discrete positions across time; we present techniquesto reconstruct entire baseball games and visually explore each play. This providesopportunities to not only derive new metrics for the game; but also allow us to investigateexisting measures with targeted visualizations. In addition; our techniques allow users tofilter on demand so specific situations can be analyzed both in general and according tothose situations.

Predicting taxi demand at high spatial resolution: Approaching the limit of predictability,Kai Zhao; Denis Khryashchev; Juliana Freire; Cláudio Silva; Huy Vo,In big cities; taxi service is imbalanced. In some areas; passengers wait too long for a taxi;while in others; many taxis roam without passengers. Knowledge of where a taxi willbecome available can help us solve the taxi demand imbalance problem. In this paper; weemploy a holistic approach to predict taxi demand at high spatial resolution. We showcaseour techniques using two real-world data sets; yellow cabs and Uber trips in New York City;and perform an evaluation over 9;940 building blocks in Manhattan. Our approach consistsof two key steps. First; we use entropy and the temporal correlation of human mobility tomeasure the demand uncertainty at the building block level.

Exploring Traffic Dynamics in Urban Environments Using Vector‐Valued Functions,Jorge Poco; Harish Doraiswamy; Huy Vo; João LD Comba; Juliana Freire; Cláudio Silva,Abstract The traffic infrastructure greatly impacts the quality of life in urban environments. Tooptimize this infrastructure; engineers and decision makers need to explore traffic data. Indoing so; they face two important challenges: the sparseness of speed sensors that coveronly a limited number of road segments; and the complexity of traffic patterns they need toanalyze. In this paper we take a first step at addressing these challenges. We use New YorkCity (NYC) taxi trips as sensors to capture traffic information. While taxis provide substantialcoverage of the city; the data captured about taxi trips contain neither the location of taxis atfrequent intervals nor their routes. We propose an efficient traffic model to derive speed anddirection information from these data; and show that it provides reliable estimates. Usingthese estimates; we define a time-varying vector-valued function on a directed graph …,Computer Graphics Forum,2015,11
Using workflow medleys to streamline exploratory tasks,Emanuele Santos; David Koop; Huy T Vo; Erik W Anderson; Juliana Freire; Cláudio Silva,Abstract To analyze and understand the growing wealth of scientific data; complexworkflows need to be assembled; often requiring the combination of loosely-coupledresources; specialized libraries; distributed computing infrastructure; and Web services.However; constructing these workflows is a non-trivial task; especially for users who do nothave programming expertise. This problem is compounded for exploratory tasks; where theworkflows need to be iteratively refined.

Yellow cabs as red corpuscles,Timothy H Savage; Huy T Vo,Data obtained from New York City's Taxi & Limousine Commission highlights the importanceof yellow cabs in the city's transportation infrastructure. In 2011; for example; there werenearly 180 million cab rides. In this paper; we provide detailed visualizations of thesenumerous journeys. Using a random sample; we also develop several relevant economicmetrics. For example; we find that nearly half of all rides were taken by a single passengertraveling short distances. In contrast; out-of-pocket costs faced by passengers averaged lessthan $6 per mile; with 90% paying less than $8 per mile; even when the social value of thecity's roads is highest. From a city planner's perspective; the current fare structure for yellowcabs may not be optimal.

Visualization in radiation oncology: Towards replacing the laboratory notebook,Erik W Anderson; Steven P Callahan; George TY Chen; Juliana Freire; Emanuele Santos; Carlos E Scheidegger; Cláudio T Silva; Huy T Vo,Abstract: Data exploration in radiation oncology requires the creation of a large number ofvisualizations. For treatment planning; detailed information about the processes used tomanipulate data collected and to create visualizations is needed for assessing the quality ofthe results. Current visualization systems allow the interactive creation and manipulation ofcomplex visualizations. However; they lack the ability to manage the data involved in thevisualization process; and in particular; they lack mechanisms to capture the provenance ofboth the visualization process and associated data. Consequently; they do not provideadequate support for the creation and exploration of a large number of visualizations.VisTrails is a visualization management system that manages both the process and meta-data associated with visualizations.

Designing a parallel dataflow architecture for streaming large-scale visualization on heterogeneous platforms,Huy T Vo,Abstract Dataflow pipeline models are widely used in visualization systems. Despite recentadvancements in parallel architecture; most systems still support only a single CPU or asmall collection of CPUs such as a SMP workstation. Even for systems that are specificallytuned towards parallel visualization; their execution models only provide support for data-parallelism while ignoring task-parallelism and pipeline-parallelism. With the recentpopularization of machines equipped with multicore CPUs and multi-GPU units; thesevisualization systems are undoubtedly falling further behind in reaching maximum efficiency.,*,2011,4
Multiresolution visualization of massive models on a large spatial 3D display,Fabio Bettio; Enrico Gobbetti; Giovanni Pintore; Fabio Marton,Abstract We report on a cluster parallel multiresolution rendering system driving a spatial 3Ddisplay able to give multiple freely moving naked-eye viewers the illusion of seeing virtualobjects floating at fixed physical locations situated in a human–scale working volume. Theefficiency of this approach is demonstrated by an application supporting interactivemanipulation of colored highly tessellated models on a large (1.6 x0. 9 meters) 50Mpixeldisplay that allows for a room-size working space.,Proceedings of the 7th Eurographics conference on Parallel Graphics and Visualization,2007,4
Access; income and racial composition: Dietary patterns aren’t just a personal choice,Elizabeth A Baker; Deidre Williams; C Kelly; MS Nanney; H Vo; E Barnidge; E Schootman; J Struthers; D Haire-Joshu,Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the extent to which dietary behavioramong urban African Americans is associated with access (healthy options at grocerystores; distance to grocery stores); income and racial composition of the community.Methods: Individual level responses to the Eating Patterns Questionnaire were aggregatedto a school district level. Community audits were conducted to determine access to highnutritional quality fruits and vegetables (vitamin C; A; and Beta carotene) and lean meat andlow fat dairy products. Geographic information systems were used to map dietary intake andcompare this to access as defined by both distance to the store (median distance) and thequality of food available. Information on income and racial composition of the communitywere obtained from the 2000 census. Results: Results showed that: 1) communities with …,American Public Health Association Annual Meeting,2003,4
STaRS: Simulating taxi ride sharing at scale,Masayo Ota; Huy Vo; Cláudio Silva; Juliana Freire,As urban populations grow; cities face many challenges related to transportation; resourceconsumption; and the environment. Ride sharing has been proposed as an effectiveapproach to reduce traffic congestion; gasoline consumption; and pollution. However;despite great promise; researchers and policy makers lack adequate tools to assess thetradeoffs and benefits of various ride-sharing strategies. In this paper; we propose a real-time; data-driven simulation framework that supports the efficient analysis of taxi ridesharing. By modeling taxis and trips as distinct entities; our framework is able to simulate arich set of realistic scenarios. At the same time; by providing a comprehensive set ofparameters; we are able to study the taxi ride-sharing problem from different angles;considering different stakeholders' interests and constraints.

Visualization and analysis of parallel dataflow execution with smart traces,Daniel K Osmari; Huy T Vo; Cláudio T Silva; João LD Comba; Lauro Lins,Most performance analysis tools focus on presenting an overload of details; with littleapplication-dependent structure; and predefined statistical summaries. This makes thecomplex relations present in a parallel program not directly recognisable to the user; makingthe task of identifying performance issues more costly in both time and effort. In this work weinvestigate the requirements to create visualisations of execution traces of parallel programsmodelled as dataflows. We propose the Smart Trace (ST) concept; to encode the structure ofthe data; and guide the construction of specialised visualizations. A visualization tool canthen leverage the relationships in the data to automate a given analysis task. We show withexamples the power and flexibility of visualisations we can create to address specificquestions formulated about the analysis of the data; with emphasis in parallel dataflow …,Graphics; Patterns and Images (SIBGRAPI); 2014 27th SIBGRAPI Conference on,2014,3
Riding from Urban Data to Insight Using New York City Taxis.,Juliana Freire; Cláudio T Silva; Huy T Vo; Harish Doraiswamy; Nivan Ferreira; Jorge Poco,Abstract About half of humanity lives in urban environments today and that number will growto 80% by the middle of this century. Cities are thus the loci of resource consumption; ofeconomic activity; and of innovation. Given our increasing ability to collect; transmit; store;and analyze data; there is a great opportunity to better understand cities; and enable them todeliver services efficiently and sustainably while keeping their citizens safe; healthy;prosperous; and well-informed. But making sense of all the data available is hard. Currently;urban data exploration is often limited to confirmatory analyses consisting of batch-orientedqueries and the exploration of well-defined questions over specific regions. The lack ofinteractivity makes this process both time-consuming and cumbersome. This problem iscompounded in the presence of big; multivariate spatio-temporal data; which is …,IEEE Data Eng.

A display wall management system to support multiple user interaction,Wendel B Silva; Huy Vo; Daniel K Osmari; Claudio T Silva,Abstract Large high-resolution displays are becoming more affordable and popular forvisualization tasks; but managing these displays in an efficient way is still a challenge.Although there are some systems that focus on this issue; they are usually bound to onespecific rendering techniques (ie; pixel streaming; distributed rendering). In addition; displaywalls are commonly used as a large output device instead of a high-resolution display; andtheir interaction is limited to a direct mapping between the input devices and mouse andkeyboard events. In this paper we presents CloudView; a display wall management systemthat allows different applications to be executed in a large display. Our solution aims atenabling multiple user interaction and collaboration. Moreover; we propose a parameter-based approach that not only allows the user to interact directly with parameters of …,ACM CHI 2013,2013,3

Topology-based catalogue exploration framework for identifying view-enhanced tower designs,Harish Doraiswamy; Nivan Ferreira; Marcos Lage; Huy Vo; Luc Wilson; Heidi Werner; Muchan Park; Cláudio Silva,Abstract There is a growing expectation for high performance design in architecture whichnegotiates between the requirements of the client and the physical constraints of a buildingsite. Clients for building projects often challenge architects to maximize view quality since itcan significantly increase real estate value. To pursue this challenge; architects typicallymove through several design revision cycles to identify a set of design options which satisfythese view quality expectations in coordination with other goals of the project. However;reviewing a large quantity of design options within the practical time constraints ischallenging due to the limitations of existing tools for view performance evaluation. Thesechallenges include flexibility in the definition of view quality and the ability to handle theexpensive computation involved in assessing both the view quality and the exploration of …,ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG),2015,2
A unified index for spatio-temporal keyword queries,Tuan-Anh Hoang-Vu; Huy T Vo; Juliana Freire,Abstract From tweets to urban data sets; there has been an explosion in the volume oftextual data that is associated with both temporal and spatial components. Efficientlyevaluating queries over these data is challenging. Previous approaches have focused onthe spatial aspect. Some used separate indices for space and text; thus incurring theoverhead of storing separate indices and joining their results. Others proposed a combinedindex that either inserts terms into a spatial structure or adds a spatial structure to aninverted index. These benefit queries with highly-selective constraints that match the primaryindex structure but have limited effectiveness and pruning power otherwise. We propose anew indexing strategy that uniformly handles text; space and time in a single structure; andis thus able to efficiently evaluate queries that combine keywords with spatial and …,Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2016,1

Multi-Threaded Streaming Pipeline For VTK,Huy T Vo; Cláudio T Silva,Abstract: In this document; we describe the implementation details of our proposal on how tomodify the VTK pipeline execution framework to support improved streaming and multi-threaded capabilities. We believe the functionality reported here is the best way to startadding this functionality to VTK.(See [1] for a higher-level description of the work thatincludes more functionality). The plan would be to first settle on the basic functionality; afterthat; it should not be hard to continue adding the rest of the framework to VTK (eg; supportfor streaming unstructured data structures and GPUs).,*,2009,1
Query-driven visualization in the cloud with mapreduce,Bill Howe; Huy Vo; Claudio Silva; J Freire,We explore the MapReduce programming model for massivescale query-driven visualanalytics. Massively parallel programming frameworks such as MapReduce are increasinglypopular for simplifying data processing on hundreds and thousands of cores; offering faulttolerance; linear scale-up; and a high-level programming interface. However; these tools arebatch-oriented and are awkward to use directly for visualization. Informed by the successand popularity of MapReduce in the database research community; we evaluate thetradeoffs of using MapReduce to support massivescale query-driven visualization; where“query" implies not just simple subsetting; but database-style algebraic manipulation.

Graphical representation and storage issues in object-oriented rule modeling,Huy T Vo; Jeffrey Peters,Abstract Rules are an important part of any programming language and system. Rules canbe employed either to enforce the correctness; integrity or admissibility of databases ordatabase states; or to define requirements specified in the design phase of a softwaredevelopment process. A rule is more than just a simple IF... THEN construction. Rules canbe viewed as objects with distinctive properties and operations; constantly interacting andrelating with other objects. Although research has been done on rules; the focus has beenmainly on retrieval; activation and firing. Our focus is on the graphical representation andstorage of rules and on event modeling in an object-oriented environment.,Proceedings of the 35th Annual Southeast Regional Conference,1997,1
A Process-Driven Approach to Provenance-Enabling Existing Applications,Steven P Callahan; Juliana Freire; Carlos E Scheidegger; Cláudio T Silva; Huy T Vo,Abstract. Currently; there are no general provenance management systems or toolsavailable for existing applications. Groups that do not have the resources or expertise tobuild the provenance infrastructure needed resort to the manual creation and maintenanceof this information; greatly hindering their ability to do large-scale and/or complex dataexploration and processing. Even with the resources; applicationdependent solutions arenot general enough and can be hard to re-use in different settings and applications. Thiscauses problems with interoperability due to differences in the provenance models usedacross systems. Our goal is to develop provenance technology and design systems that areflexible and adaptable to the wide range of requirements of software applications. Byconsolidating provenance information for a variety of applications; we can provide a …,Google Scholar,*,1
Inferring Unmet Human Mobility Demand with Multi-source Urban Data,Kai Zhao; Xinshi Zheng; Huy Vo,Abstract As the sharing economy has been increasing dramatically in the world; the mobile-hailed ridesharing companies like Uber and Lyft in the US; Didi Chuxing in China has begunto challenge traditional public transportation providers such as bus; subway or taxis.Ridesharing companies have shown their ability to provide the mobility services wherepublic transit has failed. The human mobility demand that cannot be satisfied by traditionaltransportation modes (unmet human mobility demand) can be served by the ridesharingcompanies. In this paper; we provide a 'hydrological'perspective for inferring unmet mobilitydemand patterns in cities with multi-source urban data. We observe that the unmet humanmobility demand is proportional to the met mobility demand by examining the yellow taxi andthe Uber data in New York City.

An adaptive information-theoretic approach for identifying temporal correlations in big data sets,Nguyen Ho; Huy Vo; Mai Vu,In the past two decades; new developments in computing; sensing and crowdsourced datahave resulted in an explosion in the availability of quantitative information. The possibilitiesof analyzing this so-called “big data” to inform research and the decision-making processare virtually endless. In general analyses have to be done across multiple data sets in orderto bring out the most value of big data. A first important step is to identify temporalcorrelations between data sets. Given the characteristics of big data in term of volume andvelocity; techniques that identify correlations not only need to be scalable; but also need tohelp users in ordering the correlation across temporal resolutions so that they can focus onimportant relationships. There is a large body of work in this area; however; most of themeither only deal with small data sets; using a fixed temporal resolution; or does not …,Big Data (Big Data); 2016 IEEE International Conference on,2016,*

Parallel Dataflow Scheme for Streaming (Un) Structured Data,Huy T Vo; Daniel K Osmari; Brian Summa; Joao LD Comba; Valerio Pascucci; Cláudio T Silva,Abstract: We propose new techniques for exploiting multi-core architectures in the context ofvisualization dataflow systems. Recent hardware advancements have greatly increased thelevel of parallelism available in these architectures; and it is expected that this trend is likelyto continue in the future. Existing dataflow systems have a number of limitations: they arewritten for a standard CPU programming; they mostly support a limited type of multi-threading execution; and while some systems (eg; ParaView; VisIt) include streaming andtiling methods for parallelism; due to the monolithic data and computation model; they arenot optimally suited for the higher levels of parallelism available in highly parallelarchitectures of the future.

To successfullyanalyze and validate various hypothesis; it is necessary to pose several queries; correlatedisparate data; and create insightful visualizations of both the simulated processes andobserved phenomena. Data exploration and visualization requires scientists to go throughseveral steps. They need to select data sets; specify a series of operations that need to beapplied to the data; and create appropriate visual representations; before they can finallyview and analyze the results.

Exploring Traffic Dynamics in Urban Environments Using Vector-Valued Functions,H Carr; KL Ma; G Santucci; Jorge Poco; Harish Doraiswamy; Huy T Vo; João LD Comba; Juliana Freire; Cláudio T Silva,Yen's ranking loopless shortest paths algorithm [Yen71] computes the k-shortest pathsbetween a source and destination in a graph for a given k. It inductively computes the ithshortest path between two nodes using the common subpaths of the (i− 1)-shortest paths.The algorithm uses the result of the shortest path as starting point; followed by a relaxationprocedure until the distance constraint is met. This algorithm can be used to compute theclosest path as follows: identify a set of k shortest paths; for a large enough k such that the kth shortest path is the closest path. Unfortunately; due to a grid-like structure of the roadnetwork in most part of NYC; the above algorithm doesn't work well. This is because it has tocompute and discard a lot of suboptimal paths.
