Efficient similarity joins for near-duplicate detection,Chuan Xiao; Wei Wang; Xuemin Lin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Guoren Wang,Abstract With the increasing amount of data and the need to integrate data from multipledata sources; one of the challenging issues is to identify near-duplicate records efficiently. Inthis article; we focus on efficient algorithms to find a pair of records such that their similaritiesare no less than a given threshold. Several existing algorithms rely on the prefix filteringprinciple to avoid computing similarity values for all possible pairs of records. We proposenew filtering techniques by exploiting the token ordering information; they are integrated intothe existing methods and drastically reduce the candidate sizes and hence improve theefficiency. We have also studied the implementation of our proposed algorithm in stand-alone and RDBMS-based settings. Experimental results show our proposed algorithms canoutperform previous algorithms on several real datasets.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2011,561
Probabilistic skylines on uncertain data,Jian Pei; Bin Jiang; Xuemin Lin; Yidong Yuan,Abstract Uncertain data are inherent in some important applications. Although aconsiderable amount of research has been dedicated to modeling uncertain data andanswering some types of queries on uncertain data; how to conduct advanced analysis onuncertain data remains an open problem at large. In this paper; we tackle the problem ofskyline analysis on uncertain data. We propose a novel probabilistic skyline model where anuncertain object may take a probability to be in the skyline; and a p-skyline contains all theobjects whose skyline probabilities are at least p. Computing probabilistic skylines on largeuncertain data sets is challenging. We develop two efficient algorithms. The bottom-upalgorithm computes the skyline probabilities of some selected instances of uncertain objects;and uses those instances to prune other instances and uncertain objects effectively.

Efficient computation of the skyline cube,Yidong Yuan; Xuemin Lin; Qing Liu; Wei Wang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Qing Zhang,Abstract Skyline has been proposed as an important operator for multi-criteria decisionmaking; data mining and visualization; and user-preference queries. In this paper. weconsider the problem of efficiently computing a SKYCUBE; which consists of skylines of allpossible non-empty subsets of a given set of dimensions. While existing skyline computationalgorithms can be immediately extended to computing each skyline query independently;such" shared-nothing" algorithms are inefficient. We develop several computation sharingstrategies based on effectively identifying the computation dependencies among multiplerelated skyline queries. Based on these sharing strategies; two novel algorithms; Bottom-Upand Top-Down algorithms; are proposed to compute SKYCUBE efficiently.

Selecting stars: The k most representative skyline operator,Xuemin Lin; Yidong Yuan; Qing Zhang; Ying Zhang,Skyline computation has many applications including multi-criteria decision making. In thispaper; we study the problem of selecting k skyline points so that the number of points; whichare dominated by at least one of these k skyline points; is maximized. We first present anefficient dynamic programming based exact algorithm in a 2d-space. Then; we show that theproblem is NP-hard when the dimensionality is 3 or more and it can be approximately solvedby a polynomial time algorithm with the guaranteed approximation ratio 1-1/e. To speed-upthe computation; an efficient; scalable; index-based randomized algorithm is developed byapplying the FM probabilistic counting technique. A comprehensive performance evaluationdemonstrates that our randomized technique is very efficient; highly accurate; and scalable.,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007.

Stabbing the sky: Efficient skyline computation over sliding windows,Xuemin Lin; Yidong Yuan; Wei Wang; Hongjun Lu,We consider the problem of efficiently computing the skyline against the most recent Nelements in a data stream seen so far. Specifically; we study the n-of-N skyline queries; thatis; computing the skyline for the most recent n (/spl forall/n/spl les/N) elements. Firstly; wedeveloped an effective pruning technique to minimize the number of elements to be kept. Itcan be shown that on average storing only O (log/sup d/N) elements from the most recent Nelements is sufficient to support the precise computation of all n-of-N skyline queries in a d-dimension space if the data distribution on each dimension is independent. Then; a novelencoding scheme is proposed; together with efficient update techniques; for the storedelements; so that computing an n-of-N skyline query in a d-dimension space takes O (log N+s) time that is reduced to O (d log log N+ s) if the data distribution is independent; where s …,Data Engineering; 2005.

How to draw a directed graph,Peter Eades; Lin Xuemin,Several recent tools for visualizing software and information engineering problems haveused directed graphs as a basic model. Thus considerable interest has arisen in algorithmsfor drawing directed graphs so that they are easy to understand and remember. The paperdefines three aesthetic criteria for drawings of directed graphs; and discusses a generalmethod for obtaining drawings according to these criteria. Several recent algorithms to drawdirected graphs are instances of this general method. The aesthetic criteria can be viewedas goals of optimization problems. Each step of the general method aims to achieve one ofthe criteria by solving these optimization problems. The authors discuss the current state ofknowledge of each of these problems.,Visual Languages; 1989.; IEEE Workshop on,1989,274
Taming verification hardness: an efficient algorithm for testing subgraph isomorphism,Haichuan Shang; Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Graphs are widely used to model complicated data semantics in many applications.In this paper; we aim to develop efficient techniques to retrieve graphs; containing a givenquery graph; from a large set of graphs. Considering the problem of testing subgraphisomorphism is generally NP-hard; most of the existing techniques are based on theframework of filtering-and-verification to reduce the precise computation costs; consequentlyvarious novel feature-based indexes have been developed. While the existing techniqueswork well for small query graphs; the verification phase becomes a bottleneck when thequery graph size increases. Motivated by this; in the paper we firstly propose a novel andefficient algorithm for testing subgraph isomorphism; QuickSI. Secondly; we develop a newfeature-based index technique to accommodate QuickSI in the filtering phase. Our …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,232
Ed-Join: an efficient algorithm for similarity joins with edit distance constraints,Chuan Xiao; Wei Wang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract There has been considerable interest in similarity join in the research communityrecently. Similarity join is a fundamental operation in many application areas; such as dataintegration and cleaning; bioinformatics; and pattern recognition. We focus on efficientalgorithms for similarity join with edit distance constraints. Existing approaches are mainlybased on converting the edit distance constraint to a weaker constraint on the number ofmatching q-grams between pair of strings. In this paper; we propose the novel perspective ofinvestigating mismatching q-grams. Technically; we derive two new edit distance lowerbounds by analyzing the locations and contents of mismatching q-grams. A new algorithm;Ed-Join; is proposed that exploits the new mismatch-based filtering methods; it achievessubstantial reduction of the candidate sizes and hence saves computation time.

A fast and effective heuristic for the feedback arc set problem,Peter Eades; Xuemin Lin; William F Smyth,Abstract Let G=(V; A) denote a simple connected directed graph; and let n=| V|; m=| A|;where nt-1≤ m≤(n 2) A feedback arc set (FAS) of G; denoted R (G); is a (possibly empty)set of arcs whose reversal makes G acyclic. A minimum feedback arc set of G; denotedR∗(G); is a FAS of minimum cardinality r∗(G); the computation of R∗(G) is called the FASproblem. Berger and Shor have recently published an algorithm which; for a given digraphG; computes a FAS whose cardinality is at most m/2t-c 1 m/Δ 1/2 where Δ is the maximumdegree of G and c 1 is a constant. Further; they exhibited an infinite class G of graphs withthe property that for every Gϵ G and some constant c 2; r∗(G)≥ m/2t-c 2 m/Δ 1/2. Thus theBerger-Shor algorithm provides; in a certain asymptotic sense; an optimal solution to theFAS problem.

Top-k set similarity joins,Chuan Xiao; Wei Wang; Xuemin Lin; Haichuan Shang,Similarity join is a useful primitive operation underlying many applications; such as nearduplicate Web page detection; data integration; and pattern recognition. Traditional similarityjoins require a user to specify a similarity threshold. In this paper; we study a variant of thesimilarity join; termed top-k set similarity join. It returns the top-k pairs of records ranked bytheir similarities; thus eliminating the guess work users have to perform when the similaritythreshold is unknown before hand. An algorithm; topk-join; is proposed to answer top-ksimilarity join efficiently. It is based on the prefix filtering principle and employs tight upperbounding of similarity values of unseen pairs. Experimental results demonstrate theefficiency of the proposed algorithm on large-scale real datasets.,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,162
Distance-based representative skyline,Yufei Tao; Ling Ding; Xuemin Lin; Jian Pei,Given an integer $ k $; a {\em representative skyline} contains the $ k $ skyline points thatbest describe the tradeoffs among different dimensions offered by the full skyline. Althoughthis topic has been previously studied; the existing solution may sometimes produce $ k $points that appear in an arbitrarily tiny cluster; and therefore; fail to be representative.Motivated by this; we propose a new definition of representative skyline that minimizes thedistance between a non-representative skyline point and its nearest representative. We alsostudy algorithms for computing distance-based representative skylines. In 2D space; there isa dynamic programming algorithm that guarantees the optimal solution.

Sliding-window top-k queries on uncertain streams,Cheqing Jin; Ke Yi; Lei Chen; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Query processing on uncertain data streams has attracted a lot of attentions lately;due to the imprecise nature in the data generated from a variety of streaming applications;such as readings from a sensor network. However; all of the existing works on uncertaindata streams study unbounded streams. This paper takes the first step towards the importantand challenging problem of answering sliding-window queries on uncertain data streams;with a focus on arguably one of the most important types of queries---top-k queries. Thechallenge of answering sliding-window top-k queries on uncertain data streams stems fromthe strict space and time requirements of processing both arriving and expiring tuples in high-speed streams; combined with the difficulty of coping with the exponential blowup in thenumber of possible worlds induced by the uncertain data model.

In this paper; we study the problemof approximate dictionary matching with edit distance constraints. Compared to existingstudies using token-based similarity constraints; our problem definition enables us tocapture typographical or orthographical errors; both of which are common in entity extractiontasks yet may be missed by token-based similarity constraints.

While many different types ofqueries have been studied on uncertain data; there is no previous work on answering RNNqueries on uncertain data. In this paper; we formalize probabilistic reverse nearest neighborquery that is to retrieve the objects from the uncertain data that have higher probability thana given threshold to be the RNN of an uncertain query object. We develop an efficientalgorithm based on various novel pruning approaches that solves the probabilistic RNNqueries on multidimensional uncertain data.

Efficient processing of XML path queries using the disk-based F&B index,Wei Wang; Haifeng Jiang; Hongzhi Wang; Xuemin Lin; Hongjun Lu; Jianzhong Li,Abstract With the proliferation of XML data and applications on the Internet; efficient XMLquery processing techniques are in great demand. Answering queries using XML indexes isa natural approach. A number of XML indexes have been proposed in the literature: amongthem; F&B Index is one powerful index as it is the smallest index that answers all twigqueries. However; an F&B Index suffers from the following two problems:(1) it was originallyproposed as a memory-based index while its size is usually large in practice and (2)answering queries using an F&B Index is not fully optimized. These problems limit thebenefits and even applications of F&B Indexes in practice. In this paper; we propose a highlyoptimized disk organization method for an F&B Index; the result is a disk-based F&B Indexwith good clustering properties.

Fast computation of reachability labeling for large graphs,Jiefeng Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xuemin Lin; Haixun Wang; Philip S Yu,Abstract The need of processing graph reachability queries stems from many applicationsthat manage complex data as graphs. The applications include transportation network;Internet traffic analyzing; Web navigation; semantic web; chemical informatics and bio-informatics systems; and computer vision. A graph reachability query; as one of the primarytasks; is to find whether two given data objects; u and v; are related in any ways in a largeand complex dataset. Formally; the query is about to find if v is reachable from u in a directedgraph which is large in size. In this paper; we focus ourselves on building a reachabilitylabeling for a large directed graph; in order to process reachability queries efficiently. Such alabeling needs to be minimized in size for the efficiency of answering the queries; and needsto be computed fast for the efficiency of constructing such a labeling.

Fast computing reachability labelings for large graphs with high compression rate,Jiefeng Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xuemin Lin; Haixun Wang; Philip S Yu,Abstract There are numerous applications that need to deal with a large graph and need toquery reachability between nodes in the graph. A 2-hop cover can compactly represent thewhole edge transitive closure of a graph in O (| V|.| E| 1/2) space; and be used to answerreachability query efficiently. However; it is challenging to compute a 2-hop cover. Theexisting approaches suffer from either large resource consumption or low compression rate.In this paper; we propose a hierarchical partitioning approach to partition a large graph Ginto two subgraphs repeatedly in a top-down fashion. The unique feature of our approach isthat we compute 2-hop cover while partitioning. In brief; in every iteration of top-downpartitioning; we provide techniques to compute the 2-hop cover for connections between thetwo subgraphs first. A cover is computed to cut the graph into two subgraphs; which …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,93

Spring algorithms and symmetry,Peter Eades; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Spring algorithms are regarded as effective tools for visualizing undirected graphs.One major feature of applying spring algorithms is to display symmetric properties of graphs.This feature has been confirmed by numerous experiments. In this paper; firstly we formalizethe concepts of graph symmetries in terms of “reflectional” and “rotational” automorphisms;and characterize the types of symmetries; which can be displayed simultaneously by agraph layout; in terms of “geometric” automorphism groups. We show that our formalizationis complete. Secondly; we provide general theoretical evidence of why many springalgorithms can display graph symmetry.

Continuous reverse k nearest neighbors queries in euclidean space and in spatial networks,Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Xuefei Li,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of continuous monitoring of reverse k nearestneighbors queries in Euclidean space as well as in spatial networks. Existing techniques aresensitive toward objects and queries movement. For example; the results of a query are tobe recomputed whenever the query changes its location. We present a framework forcontinuous reverse k nearest neighbor (RkNN) queries by assigning each object and querywith a safe region such that the expensive recomputation is not required as long as thequery and objects remain in their respective safe regions. This significantly improves thecomputation cost. As a byproduct; our framework also reduces the communication cost inclient---server architectures because an object does not report its location to the serverunless it leaves its safe region or the server sends a location update request.

Efficient exact edit similarity query processing with the asymmetric signature scheme,Jianbin Qin; Wei Wang; Yifei Lu; Chuan Xiao; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Given a query string Q; an edit similarity search finds all strings in a databasewhose edit distance with Q is no more than a given threshold t. Most existing methodanswering edit similarity queries rely on a signature scheme to generate candidates giventhe query string. We observe that the number of signatures generated by existing methods isfar greater than the lower bound; and this results in high query time and index spacecomplexities. In this paper; we show that the minimum signature size lower bound is t+ 1. Wethen propose asymmetric signature schemes that achieve this lower bound. We developefficient query processing algorithms based on the new scheme. Several dynamicprogramming-based candidate pruning methods are also developed to further speed up theperformance.

Lazy updates: An efficient technique to continuously monitoring reverse knn,Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Wei Wang; Wenjie Zhang,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of continuous monitoring of reverse k nearestneighbor queries. Existing continuous reverse nearest neighbor monitoring techniques aresensitive towards objects and queries movement. For example; the results of a query are tobe recomputed whenever the query changes its location. We present a framework forcontinuous reverse k nearest neighbor queries by assigning each object and query with arectangular safe region such that the expensive recomputation is not required as long as thequery and objects remain in their respective safe regions. This significantly improves thecomputation cost. As a by-product; our framework also reduces the communication cost inclient-server architectures because an object does not report its location to the server unlessit leaves its safe region or the server sends a location update request. We also conduct a …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,60
Two tree drawing conventions,Peter Eades; Tao Lin; Xuemin Lin,Rooted trees abound in computing and it is often necessary to draw them for visualizationand documentation purposes. In the classical convention for tree drawing; the tree is drawnin a “level” fashion; with nodes (represented by boxes) at depth k lying on a horizontal line ata distance of k units below the root. The parent—child relationships are represented by linesbetween the boxes. Several algorithms have been developed for constructing a compactlayout of a tree in the classical convention. In this paper we investigate algorithms fordrawing trees according to two new conventions. In the inclusion convention; nodes arerepresented by boxes; and the parent—child relationship is represented by inclusion of onebox in another. The tip-over convention again represents nodes as boxes; and; like theclassical convention; represents the parent—child relationship by lines between the …,International Journal of Computational Geometry & Applications,1993,60
Scalable big graph processing in mapreduce,Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lijun Chang; Hong Cheng; Chengqi Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract MapReduce has become one of the most popular parallel computing paradigms incloud; due to its high scalability; reliability; and fault-tolerance achieved for a large variety ofapplications in big data processing. In the literature; there are MapReduce Class MRC andMinimal MapReduce Class MMC to define the memory consumption; communication cost;CPU cost; and number of MapReduce rounds for an algorithm to execute in MapReduce.However; neither of them is designed for big graph processing in MapReduce; since theconstraints in MMC can be hardly achieved simultaneously on graphs and the conditions inMRC may induce scalability problems when processing big graph data.

Continuous monitoring of distance-based range queries,Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Ljiljana Brankovic; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Wei Wang,Given a positive value r; a distance-based range query returns the objects that lie within thedistance r of the query location. In this paper; we focus on the distance-based range queriesthat continuously change their locations in a euclidean space. We present an efficient andeffective monitoring technique based on the concept of a safe zone. The safe zone of aquery is the area with a property that while the query remains inside it; the results of thequery remain unchanged. Hence; the query does not need to be reevaluated unless itleaves the safe zone. Our contributions are as follows: 1) We propose a technique based onpowerful pruning rules and a unique access order which efficiently computes the safe zoneand minimizes the I/O cost. 2) We theoretically determine and experimentally verify theexpected distance a query moves before leaving the safe zone and; for majority of …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,54
Multi-guarded safe zone: An effective technique to monitor moving circular range queries,Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Ljiljana Brankovic; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Wei Wang,Given a positive value r; a circular range query returns the objects that lie within the distancer of the query location. In this paper; we study the circular range queries that continuouslychange their locations. We present an efficient and effective technique to monitor suchmoving range queries by utilising the concept of a safe zone. The safe zone of a query is thearea with a property that while the query remains inside it; the results of the query remainunchanged. Hence; the query does not need to be re-evaluated unless it leaves the safezone. The shape of the safe zone is defined by the so-called guard objects. The cost ofchecking whether a query lies in the safe zone takes k distance computations; where k is thenumber of the guard objects.

Spark2: Top-k keyword query in relational databases,Yi Luo; Wei Wang; Xuemin Lin; Xiaofang Zhou; Jianmin Wang; Kequi Li,With the increasing amount of text data stored in relational databases; there is a demand forRDBMS to support keyword queries over text data. As a search result is often assembledfrom multiple relational tables; traditional IR-style ranking and query evaluation methodscannot be applied directly. In this paper; we study the effectiveness and the efficiency issuesof answering top-k keyword query in relational database systems. We propose a newranking formula by adapting existing IR techniques based on a natural notion of virtualdocument. We also propose several efficient query processing methods for the new rankingmethod. We have conducted extensive experiments on large-scale real databases using twopopular RDBMSs. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvement to thealternative approaches in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,50
Connected substructure similarity search,Haichuan Shang; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Wei Wang,Abstract Substructure similarity search is to retrieve graphs that approximately contain agiven query graph. It has many applications; eg; detecting similar functions among chemicalcompounds. The problem is challenging as even testing subgraph containment between twographs is NP-complete. Hence; existing techniques adopt the filtering-and-verificationframework with the focus on developing effective and efficient techniques to remove non-promising graphs. Nevertheless; existing filtering techniques may be still unable toeffectively remove many" low" quality candidates. To resolve this; in this paper we propose anovel indexing technique; GrafD-Index; to index graphs according to their" distances" tofeatures. We characterize a tight condition under which the distance-based triangularinequality holds. We then develop lower and upper bounding techniques that exploit the …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,50
Term graph model for text classification,Wei Wang; Diep Bich Do; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Most existing text classification methods (and text mining methods at large) arebased on representing the documents using the traditional vector space model. We arguethat important information; such as the relationship among words; is lost. We propose a termgraph model to represent not only the content of a document but also the relationship amongthe keywords. We demonstrate that the new model enables us to define new similarityfunctions; such as considering rank correlation based on PageRank-style algorithms; for theclassification purpose. Our preliminary results show promising results of our new model.,ADMA,2005,49

Threshold-based probabilistic top-k dominating queries,Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Jian Pei; Wei Wang,Abstract Recently; due to intrinsic characteristics in many underlying data sets; a number ofprobabilistic queries on uncertain data have been investigated. Top-k dominating queriesare very important in many applications including decision making in a multidimensionalspace. In this paper; we study the problem of efficiently computing top-k dominating querieson uncertain data. We first formally define the problem. Then; we develop an efficient;threshold-based algorithm to compute the exact solution. To overcome some inherentcomputational deficiency in an exact computation; we develop an efficient randomizedalgorithm with an accuracy guarantee. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that bothalgorithms are quite efficient; while the randomized algorithm is quite scalable against dataset sizes; object areas; k values; etc. The randomized algorithm is also highly accurate in …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2010,47
Efficient graph similarity joins with edit distance constraints,Xiang Zhao; Chuan Xiao; Xuemin Lin; Wei Wang,Graphs are widely used to model complicated data semantics in many applications inbioinformatics; chemistry; social networks; pattern recognition; etc. A recent trend is totolerate noise arising from various sources; such as erroneous data entry; and find similaritymatches. In this paper; we study the graph similarity join problem that returns pairs of graphssuch that their edit distances are no larger than a threshold. Inspired by the q-gram idea forstring similarity problem; our solution extracts paths from graphs as features for indexing. Weestablish a lower bound of common features to generate candidates. An efficient algorithm isproposed to exploit both matching and mismatching features to improve the filtering andverification on candidates. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm significantly outperformsexisting approaches with extensive experiments on publicly available datasets.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,46
Stochastic skyline operator,Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema,In many applications involving the multiple criteria optimal decision making; users may oftenwant to make a personal trade-off among all optimal solutions. As a key feature; the skylinein a multi-dimensional space provides the minimum set of candidates for such purposes byremoving all points not preferred by any (monotonic) utility/scoring functions; that is; theskyline removes all objects not preferred by any user no mater how their preferences vary.Driven by many applications with uncertain data; the probabilistic skyline model is proposedto retrieve uncertain objects based on skyline probabilities. Nevertheless; skylineprobabilities cannot capture the preferences of monotonic utility functions. Motivated by this;in this paper we propose a novel skyline operator; namely stochastic skyline. In the light ofthe expected utility principle; stochastic skyline guarantees to provide the minimum set of …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,46
An algorithm for drawing a hierarchical graph,Peter Eades; Xuemin Lin; Roberto Tamassia,Hierarchical graphs appear in several graph drawing applications; where nodes areassigned layers for semantic reasons. More importantly; general methods for drawingdirected graphs usually begin by transforming the input digraph into a hierarchical graph;then applying a hierarchical graph drawing algorithm. This paper introduces the DegreeWeighted Barycentre (DWB) algorithm for drawing hierarchical graphs. We show thatdrawings output by DWB satisfy several important aesthetic criteria: under certainconnectivity conditions; they are planar; convex; and symmetric whenever such drawingsare possible. The algorithm can be implemented as a simple Gauss—Seidel iteration.,International Journal of Computational Geometry & Applications,1996,45
More is simpler: Effectively and efficiently assessing node-pair similarities based on hyperlinks,Weiren Yu; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Lijun Chang; Jian Pei,Abstract Similarity assessment is one of the core tasks in hyperlink analysis. Recently; withthe proliferation of applications; eg; web search and collaborative filtering; SimRank hasbeen a well-studied measure of similarity between two nodes in a graph. It recursivelyfollows the philosophy that" two nodes are similar if they are referenced (have incomingedges) from similar nodes"; which can be viewed as an aggregation of similarities based onincoming paths. Despite its popularity; SimRank has an undesirable property; ie;" zero-similarity": It only accommodates paths with equal length from a common" center" node.Thus; a large portion of other paths are fully ignored. This paper attempts to remedy thisissue.(1) We propose and rigorously justify SimRank*; a revised version of SimRank; whichresolves such counter-intuitive" zero-similarity" issues while inheriting merits of the basic …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,44

In this paper; westudy how to match two large graphs by maximizing the number of matched edges; which isknown as maximum common subgraph matching and is NP-hard. To find exact matching; itcannot a graph with more than 30 nodes. To find an approximate matching; the quality canbe very poor. We propose a novel two-step approach that can efficiently match two largegraphs over thousands of nodes with high matching quality. In the first step; we propose ananchor-selection/expansion approach to compute a good initial matching. In the secondstep; we propose a new approach to refine the initial matching.

Efficiently answering top-k typicality queries on large databases,Ming Hua; Jian Pei; Ada WC Fu; Xuemin Lin; Ho-Fung Leung,Abstract Finding typical instances is an effective approach to understand and analyze largedata sets. In this paper; we apply the idea of typicality analysis from psychology andcognition science to database query answering; and study the novel problem of answeringtop-k typicality queries. We model typicality in large data sets systematically. To answerquestions like" Who are the top-k most typical NBA players?"; the measure of simpletypicality is developed. To answer questions like" Who are the top-k most typical guardsdistinguishing guards from other players?"; the notion of discriminative typicality is proposed.Computing the exact answer to a top-k typicality query requires quadratic time which is oftentoo costly for online query answering on large databases.

A graph based cluster approach for vertical partitioning in database design,Xuemin Lin; Maria Orlowska; Yanchun Zhang,Abstract In this paper; a new graphical approach to vertical partitioning of a relation ispresented. The proposed algorithm-taking an attribute affinity graph as an input-has twomajor steps. In the first phase; a set of clusters on the affinity graph is constructed; whereeach cluster is a vertex set of a subgraph with a 'strong'connectivity between its vertices. Inthe second phase; clusters with the 'highest affinity index'are iteratively chosen as fragments.This approach resolves most of the deficiencies of the partitioning algorithm by Navathe-Ra[11]. Moreover; it produces better quality results than the approach presented in [10].,Data & Knowledge Engineering,1993,40
A space and time efficient algorithm for SimRank computation,Weiren Yu; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Qing Zhang; Jiajin Le,Abstract SimRank has become an important similarity measure to rank web documentsbased on a graph model on hyperlinks. The existing approaches for conducting SimRankcomputation adopt an iteration paradigm. The most efficient deterministic technique yieldsO\left(n^3\right) worst-case time per iteration with the space requirement O\left(n^2\right);where n is the number of nodes (web documents). In this paper; we propose noveloptimization techniques such that each iteration takes O\left(\min\left{n⋅m;n^r\right\}\right)time and O\left(n+m\right) space; where m is the number of edges in a web-graph model andr≤ log 2 7. In addition; we extend the similarity transition matrix to prevent random surfersgetting stuck; and devise a pruning technique to eliminate impractical similarities for eachiteration.

Spotting significant changing subgraphs in evolving graphs,Zheng Liu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Yiping Ke; Xuemin Lin; Lei Chen,Graphs are popularly used to model structural relationships between objects. In manyapplication domains such as social networks; sensor networks and telecommunication;graphs evolve over time. In this paper; we study a new problem of discovering thesubgraphs that exhibit significant changes in evolving graphs. This problem is challengingsince it is hard to define changing regions that are closely related to the actual changes (ie;additions/deletions of edges/nodes) in graphs. We formalize the problem; and design anefficient algorithm that is able to identify the changing subgraphs incrementally.

In this paper; we study efficientalgorithms for similarity joins with an edit distance constraint. Currently; the most prevalentapproach is based on extracting overlapping grams from strings and considering onlystrings that share a certain number of grams as candidates. Unlike these existingapproaches; we propose a novel approach to edit similarity join based on extractingnonoverlapping substrings; or chunks; from strings.

Robust subspace clustering for multi-view data by exploiting correlation consensus,Yang Wang; Xuemin Lin; Lin Wu; Wenjie Zhang; Qing Zhang; Xiaodi Huang,More often than not; a multimedia data described by multiple features; such as color andshape features; can be naturally decomposed of multi-views. Since multi-views providecomplementary information to each other; great endeavors have been dedicated byleveraging multiple views instead of a single view to achieve the better clusteringperformance. To effectively exploit data correlation consensus among multi-views; in thispaper; we study subspace clustering for multi-view data while keeping individual views wellencapsulated. For characterizing data correlations; we generate a similarity matrix in a waythat high affinity values are assigned to data objects within the same subspace across views;while the correlations among data objects from distinct subspaces are minimized. Beforegenerating this matrix; however; we should consider that multi-view data in practice might …,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,2015,34

A variation to that is to find all occurrences of a particular pattern (the query) in alarge database graph. We call it subgraph matching problem. The state of art solution to thisproblem is GADDI. In this paper; we will propose a more efficient index and algorithm toanswer subgraph matching problem. The index is based on the label distribution ofneighbourhood vertices and it is structured as a multi-dimensional vector signature. A novelalgorithm is also proposed to further speed up the isomorphic enumeration process. Thisalgorithm attempts to maximize the computational sharing.

Towards metric fusion on multi-view data: a cross-view based graph random walk approach,Yang Wang; Xuemin Lin; Qing Zhang,Abstract Many real-world objects described by multiple attributes or features can bedecomposed as multiple" views"(eg; an image can be described by a color view or a shapeview); which often provides complementary information to each other. Learning a metric(similarity measures) for multi-view data is primary due to its wide applications in practices.However; leveraging multi-view information to produce a good metric is a great challengeand existing techniques are concerned with pairwise similarities; leading to undesirablefusion metric and high computational complexity.

In thispaper; we combine the feature of top-k objects with that of skyline to model the problem oftop-k skyline objects against uncertain data. The problem of efficiently computing top-kskyline objects on large uncertain datasets is challenging in both discrete and continuouscases. In this paper; firstly an efficient exact algorithm for computing the top-k skyline objectsis developed for discrete cases. To address applications where each object may have amassive set of instances or a continuous probability density function; we also develop anefficient randomized algorithm with an ϵ‐approximation guarantee. Moreover; ouralgorithms can be immediately extended to efficiently compute p-skyline; that is; retrievingthe uncertain objects with skyline probabilities above a given threshold.

However; all the existing works on uncertaindata streams study unbounded streams. In this paper; we take the first step towards theimportant and challenging problem of answering sliding-window queries on uncertain datastreams; with a focus on one of the most important types of queries--top-k queries. It isnontrivial to find an efficient solution for answering sliding-window top-k queries onuncertain data streams; because challenges not only stem from the strict space and timerequirements of processing both arriving and expiring tuples in high-speed streams; but alsorise from the exponential blowup in the number of possible worlds induced by the …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2010,32

We havestudied the query processing cost and propose two index construction strategies aimed atoptimizing the performance of different types of data graphs: top-down strategy and bottom-up strategy. Moreover; a novel indexing technique is proposed by effectively merging theindexes of individual data graphs; this not only reduces the index size but also furtherreduces the query processing time.

Towards efficient SimRank computation on large networks,Weiren Yu; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang,SimRank has been a powerful model for assessing the similarity of pairs of vertices in agraph. It is based on the concept that two vertices are similar if they are referenced by similarvertices. Due to its self-referentiality; fast SimRank computation on large graphs posessignificant challenges. The state-of-the-art work [17] exploits partial sums memorization forcomputing SimRank in O (Kmn) time on a graph with n vertices and m edges; where K is thenumber of iterations. Partial sums memorizing can reduce repeated calculations by cachingpart of similarity summations for later reuse. However; we observe that computations amongdifferent partial sums may have duplicate redundancy. Besides; for a desired accuracy ϵ;the existing SimRank model requires K=[log C ϵ] iterations [17]; where C is a dampingfactor.

Surface k-NN query processing,Ke Deng; Heng Tao Shen; Kai Xu; Xuemin Lin,A k-NN query finds the k nearest-neighbors of a given point from a point database. When it issufficient to measure object distance using the Euclidian distance; the key to efficient k-NNquery processing is to fetch and check the distances of a minimum number of points from thedatabase. For many applications; such as vehicle movement along road networks or roverand animal movement along terrain surfaces; the distance is only meaningful when it isalong a valid movement path. For this type of k-NN queries; the focus of efficient queryprocessing is to minimize the cost of computing distances using the environment data (suchas the road network data and the terrain data); which can be several orders of magnitudelarger than that of the point data. Efficient processing of k-NN queries based on the Euclidiandistance or the road network distance has been investigated extensively in the past. In …,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06.

In this paper; we study the problem of learninghash functions in the context of multi-modal data for cross-modal similarity search.Notwithstanding the progress achieved by existing methods; they essentially learn only onecommon hamming space; where data objects from all modalities are mapped to conductsimilarity search. However; such method is unable to well characterize the flexible anddiscriminative local (neighborhood) structure in all modalities simultaneously; hinderingthem to achieve better performance.

For example; a location-based e-coupon system may allow potentially millions of users to register their continuous spatial-keyword queries (eg; interests in nearby sales) by specifying a set of keywords and a spatialregion; the system then delivers each incoming spatial-textual object (eg; a geo-tagged e-coupon) to all the matched queries (ie; users) whose spatial and textual requirements aresatisfied.

Diverse featurerepresentations may combat this problem from different aspects; as visual data objectsdescribed by multiple features can be decomposed into multiple views; thus often providecomplementary information. In this paper; we propose a cross-view fusion algorithm thatleads to a similarity metric for multiview data by systematically fusing multiple similaritymeasures.

Diversified spatial keyword search on road networks,Chengyuan Zhang; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xiaoyang Wang,ABSTRACT With the increasing pervasiveness of the geo-positioning technologies; there isan enormous amount of spatio-textual objects available in many applications such aslocation based services and social networks. Consequently; various types of spatial keywordsearches which explore both locations and textual descriptions of the objects have beenintensively studied by the research communities and commercial organizations. In manyimportant applications (eg; location based services); the closeness of two spatial objects ismeasured by the road network distance. Moreover; the result diversification is becoming acommon practice to enhance the quality of the search results. Motived by the above facts; inthis paper we study the problem of diversified spatial keyword search on road networkswhich considers both the relevance and the spatial diversity of the results.

Effectively indexing the multi-dimensional uncertain objects for range searching,Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Qianlu Lin; Xuemin Lin,Abstract The range searching problem is fundamental in a wide spectrum of applicationssuch as radio frequency identification (RFID) networks; location based services (LBS); andglobal position system (GPS). As the uncertainty is inherent in those applications; it is highlydemanded to address the uncertainty in the range search since the traditional techniquescannot be applied due to the inherence difference between the uncertain data andtraditional data. In the paper; we propose a novel indexing structure; named U-Quadtree; toorganize the uncertain objects in a multi-dimensional space such that the range searchingcan be answered efficiently by applying filtering techniques.

Ranking queries on uncertain data,Ming Hua; Jian Pei; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Uncertain data is inherent in a few important applications. It is far from trivial toextend ranking queries (also known as top-k queries); a popular type of queries on certaindata; to uncertain data. In this paper; we cast ranking queries on uncertain data using threeparameters: rank threshold k; probability threshold p; and answer set size threshold l.Systematically; we identify four types of ranking queries on uncertain data. First; a probabilitythreshold top-k query computes the uncertain records taking a probability of at least p to bein the top-k list. Second; a top-(k; l) query returns the top-l uncertain records whoseprobabilities of being ranked among top-k are the largest. Third; the p-rank of an uncertainrecord is the smallest number k such that the record takes a probability of at least p to beranked in the top-k list. A rank threshold top-k query retrieves the records whose p-ranks …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2011,27
A multi-resolution surface distance model for k-NN query processing,Ke Deng; Xiaofang Zhou; Heng Tao Shen; Qing Liu; Kai Xu; Xuemin Lin,Abstract A spatial k-NN query returns k nearest points in a point dataset to a given querypoint. To measure the distance between two points; most of the literature focuses on theEuclidean distance or the network distance. For many applications; such as wildlifemovement; it is necessary to consider the surface distance; which is computed from theshortest path along a terrain surface. In this paper; we investigate the problem of efficientsurface k-NN (sk-NN) query processing. This is an important yet highly challenging problembecause the underlying environment data can be very large and the computational cost offinding the shortest path on a surface can be very high. To minimize the amount of surfacedata to be used and the cost of surface distance computation; a multi-resolution surfacedistance model is proposed in this paper to take advantage of monotonic distance …,The VLDB Journal,2008,27
Efficient processing of graph similarity queries with edit distance constraints,Xiang Zhao; Chuan Xiao; Xuemin Lin; Wei Wang; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract Graphs are widely used to model complicated data semantics in many applicationsin bioinformatics; chemistry; social networks; pattern recognition; etc. A recent trend is totolerate noise arising from various sources such as erroneous data entries and find similaritymatches. In this paper; we study graph similarity queries with edit distance constraints.Inspired by the q-gram idea for string similarity problems; our solution extracts paths fromgraphs as features for indexing. We establish a lower bound of common features to generatecandidates. Efficient algorithms are proposed to handle three types of graph similarityqueries by exploiting both matching and mismatching features as well as degree informationto improve the filtering and verification on candidates.

Probabilistic skylines on uncertain data: model and bounding-pruning-refining methods,Bin Jiang; Jian Pei; Xuemin Lin; Yidong Yuan,Abstract Uncertain data are inherent in some important applications. Although aconsiderable amount of research has been dedicated to modeling uncertain data andanswering some types of queries on uncertain data; how to conduct advanced analysis onuncertain data remains an open problem at large. In this paper; we tackle the problem ofskyline analysis on uncertain data. We propose a novel probabilistic skyline model where anuncertain object may take a probability to be in the skyline; and ap-skyline contains allobjects whose skyline probabilities are at least p (0< p≤ 1). Computing probabilisticskylines on large uncertain data sets is challenging. We develop a bounding-pruning-refining framework and three algorithms systematically.

TreeSpan: efficiently computing similarity all-matching,Gaoping Zhu; Xuemin Lin; Ke Zhu; Wenjie Zhang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Given a query graph $ q $ and a data graph G; computing all occurrences of q in G;namely exact all-matching; is fundamental in graph data analysis with a wide spectrum ofreal applications. It is challenging since even finding one occurrence of q in G (subgraphisomorphism test) is NP-Complete. Consider that in many real applications; exploratoryqueries from users are often inaccurate to express their real demands. In this paper; westudy the problem of efficiently computing all approximate occurrences of q in G. Particularly;we study the problem of efficiently retrieving all matches of q in G with the number ofpossible missing edges bounded by a given threshold θ; namely similarity all-matching. Theproblem of similarity all-matching is harder than the problem of exact all-matching since itcovers the problem of exact all-matching as a special case with θ= 0.

Iterative views agreement: an iterative low-rank based structured optimization method to multi-view spectral clustering,Yang Wang; Wenjie Zhang; Lin Wu; Xuemin Lin; Meng Fang; Shirui Pan,Abstract: Multi-view spectral clustering; which aims at yielding an agreement or consensusdata objects grouping across multi-views with their graph laplacian matrices; is afundamental clustering problem. Among the existing methods; Low-Rank Representation(LRR) based method is quite superior in terms of its effectiveness; intuitiveness androbustness to noise corruptions. However; it aggressively tries to learn a common low-dimensional subspace for multi-view data; while inattentively ignoring the local manifoldstructure in each view; which is critically important to the spectral clustering; worse still; thelow-rank minimization is enforced to achieve the data correlation consensus among allviews; failing to flexibly preserve the local manifold structure for each view. In this paper; 1)we propose a multi-graph laplacian regularized LRR with each graph laplacian …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1608.05560,2016,24

Top-k typicality queries and efficient query answering methods on large databases,Ming Hua; Jian Pei; Ada W Fu; Xuemin Lin; Ho-Fung Leung,Abstract Finding typical instances is an effective approach to understand and analyze largedata sets. In this paper; we apply the idea of typicality analysis from psychology andcognitive science to database query answering; and study the novel problem of answeringtop-k typicality queries. We model typicality in large data sets systematically. Three types oftop-k typicality queries are formulated. To answer questions like “Who are the top-k mosttypical NBA players?”; the measure of simple typicality is developed. To answer questionslike “Who are the top-k most typical guards distinguishing guards from other players?”; thenotion of discriminative typicality is proposed. Moreover; to answer questions like “Who arethe best k typical guards in whole representing different types of guards?”; the notion ofrepresentative typicality is used.

Fast incremental simrank on link-evolving graphs,Weiren Yu; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang,SimRank is an arresting measure of node-pair similarity based on hyperlinks. It iterativelyfollows the concept that 2 nodes are similar if they are referenced by similar nodes. Realgraphs are often large; and links constantly evolve with small changes over time. This paperconsiders fast incremental computations of SimRank on link-evolving graphs. The priorapproach [12] to this issue factorizes the graph via a singular value decomposition (SVD)first; and then incrementally maintains this factorization for link updates at the expense ofexactness. Consequently; all node-pair similarities are estimated in O (r 4 n 2) time on agraph of n nodes; where r is the target rank of the low-rank approximation; which is notnegligibly small in practice. In this paper; we propose a novel fast incremental paradigm.(1)We characterize the SimRank update matrix ΔS; in response to every link update; via a …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,23
A partition-based approach to structure similarity search,Xiang Zhao; Chuan Xiao; Xuemin Lin; Qing Liu; Wenjie Zhang,Abstract Graphs are widely used to model complex data in many applications; such asbioinformatics; chemistry; social networks; pattern recognition; etc. A fundamental andcritical query primitive is to efficiently search similar structures in a large collection of graphs.This paper studies the graph similarity queries with edit distance constraints. Existingsolutions to the problem utilize fixed-size overlapping substructures to generate candidates;and thus become susceptible to large vertex degrees or large distance thresholds. In thispaper; we present a partition-based approach to tackle the problem. By dividing data graphsinto variable-size non-overlapping partitions; the edit distance constraint is converted to agraph containment constraint for candidate generation. We develop efficient queryprocessing algorithms based on the new paradigm. A candidate pruning technique and …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,23
Efficient construction of safe regions for moving knn queries over dynamic datasets,Mahady Hasan; Muhammad Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang,Abstract The concept of safe region has been used to reduce the computation andcommunication cost for the continuous monitoring of k nearest neighbor (k NN) queries. Asafe region is an area such that as long as a query remains in it; the set of its k NNs does notchange. In this paper; we present an efficient technique to construct the safe region by usingcheap RangeNN queries. We also extend our approach for dynamic datasets (the objectsmay appear or disappear from the dataset). Our proposed algorithm outperforms existingalgorithms and scales better with the increase in k.,Advances in Spatial and Temporal Databases,2009,23

Locating motifs in time-series data,Zheng Liu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xuemin Lin; Hongjun Lu; Wei Wang,Abstract Finding motifs in time-series is proposed to make clustering of time-seriessubsequences meaningful; because most existing algorithms of clustering time-seriessubsequences are reported meaningless in recent studies. The existing motif findingalgorithms emphasize the efficiency at the expense of quality; in terms of the number of time-series subsequences in a motif and the total number of motifs found. In this paper; weformalize the problem as a continuous top-k motif balls problem in an m-dimensional space;and propose heuristic approaches that can significantly improve the quality of motifs withreasonable overhead; as shown in our experimental studies.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2005,23
Scalable subgraph enumeration in MapReduce,Longbin Lai; Lu Qin; Xuemin Lin; Lijun Chang,Abstract Subgraph enumeration; which aims to find all the subgraphs of a large data graphthat are isomorphic to a given pattern graph; is a fundamental graph problem with a widerange of applications. However; existing sequential algorithms for subgraph enumeration fallshort in handling large graphs due to the involvement of computationally intensive subgraphisomorphism operations. Thus; some recent researches focus on solving the problem usingMapReduce. Nevertheless; exiting MapReduce approaches are not scalable to handle verylarge graphs since they either produce a huge number of partial results or consume a largeamount of memory. Motivated by this; in this paper; we propose a new algorithmTwinTwigJoin based on a left-deep-join framework in MapReduce; in which the basic joinunit is a TwinTwig (an edge or two incident edges of a node).

Stochastic skylines,Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Qing Zhang,Abstract In many applications involving multiple criteria optimal decision making; users mayoften want to make a personal trade-off among all optimal solutions for selecting one objectthat fits best their personal needs. As a key feature; the skyline in a multidimensional spaceprovides the minimum set of candidates for such purposes by removing all points notpreferred by any (monotonic) utility/scoring functions; that is; the skyline removes all objectsnot preferred by any user no matter how their preferences vary. Driven by many recentapplications with uncertain data; the probabilistic skyline model is proposed to retrieveuncertain objects based on skyline probabilities. Nevertheless; skyline probabilities cannotcapture the preferences of monotonic utility functions. Motivated by this; in this article wepropose a novel skyline operator; namely stochastic skylines.

Effective multi-query expansions: robust landmark retrieval,Yang Wang; Xuemin Lin; Lin Wu; Wenjie Zhang,Abstract Given a query photo issued by a user (q-user); the landmark retrieval is to return aset of photos with their landmarks similar to those of the query; while the existing studies onthe landmark retrieval focus on exploiting geometries of landmarks for similarity matchesbetween candidate photos and a query photo. We observe that the same landmarksprovided by different users may convey different geometry information depending on theviewpoints and/or angles; and may subsequently yield very different results. In fact; dealingwith the landmarks with shapes caused by the photography of q-users is often nontrivial andhas never been studied. Motivated by this; in this paper we propose a novel framework;namely multi-query expansions; to retrieve semantically robust landmarks by two steps.Firstly; we identify the top-k photos regarding the latent topics of a query landmark to …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM international conference on Multimedia,2015,21
Efficiently monitoring top-k pairs over sliding windows,Zhitao Shen; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Haixun Wang,Top-k pairs queries have received significant attention by the research community. k-closestpairs queries; k-furthest pairs queries and their variants are among the most well studiedspecial cases of the top-k pairs queries. In this paper; we present the first approach toanswer a broad class of top-k pairs queries over sliding windows. Our framework handlesmultiple top-k pairs queries and each query is allowed to use a different scoring function; adifferent value of k and a different size of the sliding window. Although the number ofpossible pairs in the sliding window is quadratic to the number of objects N in the slidingwindow; we efficiently answer the top-k pairs query by maintaining a small subset of pairscalled K-sky band which is expected to consist of O (K log (N/K)) pairs. For all the queriesthat use the same scoring function; we need to maintain only one K-sky band. We present …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,21
Spring algorithms and symmetry,Peter Eades; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Spring algorithms are effective tools for visualizing undirected graphs. One majorfeature of applying spring algorithms is to display symmetric structures of graphs. Thisfeature has been confirmed by numerous experiments. In this paper; we firstly formalize theconcepts of graph symmetries in terms of “reflectional” and “rotational” automorphisms; andcharacterize the types of symmetries; which can be displayed simultaneously by a graphlayout; in terms of “geometric” automorphism groups. We show that our formalization iscomplete. Secondly; we provide general theoretical evidence of why spring algorithms candisplay graph symmetry. Finally; the strength of our general theorem is demonstrated from itsapplication to several existing spring algorithms.,Computing and Combinatorics,1997,21
SRS: solving c-approximate nearest neighbor queries in high dimensional euclidean space with a tiny index,Yifang Sun; Wei Wang; Jianbin Qin; Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Nearest neighbor searches in high-dimensional space have many importantapplications in domains such as data mining; and multimedia databases. The problem ischallenging due to the phenomenon called" curse of dimensionality". An alternative solutionis to consider algorithms that returns a c-approximate nearest neighbor (c-ANN) withguaranteed probabilities. Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is among the most widelyadopted method; and it achieves high efficiency both in theory and practice. However; it isknown to require an extremely high amount of space for indexing; hence limiting itsscalability. In this paper; we propose several surprisingly simple methods to answer c-ANNqueries with theoretical guarantees requiring only a single tiny index.

A Unified Framework for Efficiently Processing Ranking Related Queries.,Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Zhitao Shen; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang,ABSTRACT The computation of k-lower envelope is a classical problem and has been verywell studied for main memory non-indexed data. In this paper; we study the problem from thedatabase perspective and present the first algorithm which utilizes the presence of the indexand achieves access optimality; ie; it accesses a node of the index only if the correctness ofthe results cannot be guaranteed without accessing this node. We also demonstrate theapplications of k-lower envelope in ranking systems. Let an object be called valuable if it isone of the top-k objects according to at least one linear scoring function. In this paper; weanswer the following important questions that may be asked by different users: 1) I am notsure what scoring function I should use; therefore; return me the set of valuable objects sothat I can select an object I like the most; 2) How can I modify the attributes (eg; price) of …,EDBT,2014,20
Efficient recovery of missing events,Jianmin Wang; Shaoxu Song; Xiaochen Zhu; Xuemin Lin,Abstract For various entering and transmission issues raised by human or system; missingevents often occur in event data; which record execution logs of business processes.Without recovering these missing events; applications such as provenance analysis orcomplex event processing built upon event data are not reliable. Following the minimumchange discipline in improving data quality; it is also rational to find a recovery that minimallydiffers from the original data. Existing recovery approaches fall short of efficiency owing toenumerating and searching over all the possible sequences of events. In this paper; westudy the efficient techniques for recovering missing events. According to our theoreticalresults; the recovery problem is proved to be NP-hard. Nevertheless; we are able toconcisely represent the space of event sequences in a branching framework. Advanced …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,20
Multiscale histograms: Summarizing topological relations in large spatial datasets,Xuemin Lin; Qing Liu; Yidong Yuan; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Summarizing topological relations is fundamental to many spatial applicationsincluding spatial query optimization. In this paper; we present several novel techniques toeffectively construct cell density based spatial histograms for range (window)summarizations restricted to the four most important topological relations: contains;contained; overlap; and disjoint. We first present a novel framework to construct a multiscalehistogram composed of multiple Euler histograms with the guarantee of the exactsummarization results for aligned windows in constant time.

BMC: an efficient method to evaluate probabilistic reachability queries,Ke Zhu; Wenjie Zhang; Gaoping Zhu; Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Reachability query is a fundamental problem in graph databases. It answerswhether or not there exists a path between a source vertex and a destination vertex and iswidely used in various applications including road networks; social networks; world wideweb and bioinformatics. In some emerging important applications; uncertainties may beinherent in the graphs. For instance; each edge in a graph could be associated with aprobability to appear. In this paper; we study the reachability problem over such uncertaingraphs in a threshold fashion; namely; to determine if a source vertex could reach adestination vertex with probabilty larger than a user specified probability value t. Findingreachability on uncertain graphs has been proved to be NP-Hard.

Confirmation: increasing resource availability for transactional workflows,Chengfei Liu; Xuemin Lin; Maria Orlowska; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract The notion of compensation is widely used in advanced transaction models asmeans of recovery from a failure. Similar concepts are adopted for providing “transaction-like” behaviour for long business processes supported by workflows technology. In general;it is not trivial to design compensating tasks for tasks in the context of a workflow. Actually; atask in a workflow process does not have to be compensatable in the sense that theforcibility of “reverse” operations of the task is not always guaranteed by the applicationsemantics. In addition; the isolation requirement on data resources may make a task difficultto compensate. In this paper; we first look into the requirements that a compensating taskhas to satisfy. Then we introduce a new concept called confirmation. With the help ofconfirmation; we are able to modify most non-compensatable tasks so that they become …,Information Sciences,2003,19

Shifting multi-hypergraphs via collaborative probabilistic voting,Yang Wang; Xuemin Lin; Lin Wu; Qing Zhang; Wenjie Zhang,Abstract Graphs are widely utilized to characterize the complex relationship among big data.Graph mode seeking is of great importance to many applications in data mining andmachine learning era; and it attracts a number of approaches. Typically; existing methods;eg; graph shift; focus on shifting vertices based on pairwise edges (ie; an edge connectingtwo vertices) to find the cohesively dense subgraph. However; they overlooked thesemantics of these subgraphs; resulting into undesirable results to the users in specificapplications; eg; saliency detection. In this paper; we propose a novel paradigm aimed atshifting high-order edges (ie; hyperedges) to deliver graph modes; via a novel probabilisticvoting strategy. As a result; the generated graph modes based on dense subhypergraphsmay more accurately capture the semantics of objects besides the self-cohesiveness …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2016,18
Exploiting correlation consensus: Towards subspace clustering for multi-modal data,Yang Wang; Xuemin Lin; Lin Wu; Wenjie Zhang; Qing Zhang,Abstract Often; a data object described by many features can be decomposed as multi-modalities; which always provide complementary information to each other. In this paper; westudy subspace clustering for multi-modal data by effectively exploiting data correlationconsensus across modalities; while keeping individual modalities well encapsulated. Ourtechnique can yield a more ideal data similarity matrix; which encodes strong datacorrelations for the cross-modal data objects in the same subspace. To these ends; wepropose a novel angular based regularizer coupled with our objective function; which isaided by trace lasso and minimized to yield sparse representation vectors encoding datacorrelations in multiple modalities. As a result; the sparse code vectors of the same cross-modal data have small angular difference so as to achieve the data correlation …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Multimedia,2014,18
Multi-manifold ranking: Using multiple features for better image retrieval,Yang Wang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Qing Zhang,Abstract Manifold Ranking (MR) is one of the most popular graph-based ranking methodsand has been widely used for information retrieval. Due to its ability to capture the geometricstructure of the image set; it has been successfully used for image retrieval. The existingapproaches that use manifold ranking rely only on a single image manifold. However; suchmethods may not fully discover the geometric structure of the image set and may lead topoor precision results. Motivated by this; we propose a novel method named Multi-ManifoldRanking (MMR) which embeds multiple image manifolds each constructed using a differentimage feature. We propose a novel cost function that is minimized to obtain the rankingscores of the images.

Skyline probability over uncertain preferences,Qing Zhang; Pengjie Ye; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang,Abstract Skyline analysis is a key in a wide spectrum of real applications involving multi-criteria optimal decision making. In recent years; a considerable amount of research hasbeen contributed on efficient computation of skyline probabilities over uncertainenvironment. Most studies if not all; assume uncertainty lies only in attribute values. To theextent of our knowledge; only one study addresses the skyline probability computationproblem in scenarios where uncertainty resides in attribute preferences; instead of values.However this study takes a problematic approach by assuming independent objectdominance; which we find is not always true in uncertain preference scenarios. In fact thisassumption has already been shown to be not necessarily true in uncertain value scenarios.Motivated by this; we revisit the skyline probability computation over uncertain …,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,18
Space efficient quantile summary for constrained sliding windows on a data stream,Jian Xu; Xuemin Lin; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract In many online applications; we need to maintain quantile statistics for a slidingwindow on a data stream. The sliding windows in natural form are defined as the mostrecent N data items. In this paper; we study the problem of estimating quantiles over othertypes of sliding windows. We present a uniform framework to process quantile queries fortime constrained and filter based sliding windows. Our algorithm makes one pass on thedata stream and maintains an ε-approximate summary. It uses O(1ϵ^2\log^2ϵN) spacewhere N is the number of data items in the window. We extend this framework to furtherprocess generalized constrained sliding window queries and proved that our technique isapplicable for flexible window settings.

Efficient subgraph matching by postponing cartesian products,Fei Bi; Lijun Chang; Xuemin Lin; Lu Qin; Wenjie Zhang,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of subgraph matching that extracts all subgraphisomorphic embeddings of a query graph q in a large data graph G. The existing algorithmsfor subgraph matching follow Ullmann's backtracking approach; that is; iteratively map queryvertices to data vertices by following a matching order of query vertices. It has been shownthat the matching order of query vertices is a very important aspect to the efficiency of asubgraph matching algorithm. Recently; many advanced techniques; such as enforcingconnectivity and merging similar vertices in query or data graphs; have been proposed toprovide an effective matching order with the aim to reduce unpromising intermediate resultsespecially the ones caused by redundant Cartesian products. In this paper; for the first timewe address the issue of unpromising results by Cartesian products from" dissimilar" …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,17
Shifting hypergraphs by probabilistic voting,Yang Wang; Xuemin Lin; Qing Zhang; Lin Wu,Abstract In this paper; we develop a novel paradigm; namely hypergraph shift; to find robustgraph modes by probabilistic voting strategy; which are semantically sound besides the self-cohesiveness requirement in forming graph modes. Unlike the existing techniques to seekgraph modes by shifting vertices based on pair-wise edges (ie; an edge with 2 ends); ourparadigm is based on shifting high-order edges (hyperedges) to deliver graph modes.Specifically; we convert the problem of seeking graph modes as the problem of seekingmaximizers of a novel objective function with the aim to generate good graph modes basedon sifting edges in hypergraphs. As a result; the generated graph modes based on densesubhypergraphs may more accurately capture the object semantics besides the self-cohesiveness requirement. We also formally prove that our technique is always …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2014,17
SLICE: reviving regions-based pruning for reverse k nearest neighbors queries,Shiyu Yang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang,Given a set of facilities and a set of users; a reverse k nearest neighbors (RkNN) query qreturns every user for which the query facility is one of the k-closest facilities. Due to itsimportance; RkNN query has received significant research attention in the past few years.Almost all of the existing techniques adopt a pruning-and-verification framework. Regions-based pruning and half-space pruning are the two most notable pruning strategies. The half-space based approach prunes a larger area and is generally believed to be superior.Influenced by this perception; almost all existing RkNN algorithms utilize and improve thehalf-space pruning strategy. We observe the weaknesses and strengths of both strategiesand discover that the regions-based pruning has certain strengths that have not beenexploited in the past. Motivated by this; we present a new RkNN algorithm called SLICE …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,17
A safe zone based approach for monitoring moving skyline queries,Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Ying Zhang,Abstract Given a set of criterions; an object o dominates another object ó if o is morepreferable than ó according to every criterion. A skyline query returns every object that is notdominated by any other object. In this paper; we study the problem of continuouslymonitoring a moving skyline query where one of the criterions is the distance between theobjects and the moving query. We propose a safe zone based approach to address thechallenge of efficiently updating the results as the query moves. A safe zone is the area suchthat the results of a query remain unchanged as long as the query lies inside this area.Hence; the results are required to be updated only when the query leaves its safe zone.Although the main focus of this paper is to present the techniques for Euclidean distancemetric; the proposed techniques are applicable to any metric distance (eg; Manhattan …,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,17
A unified approach for computing top-k pairs in multidimensional space,Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Haixun Wang; Jianmin Wang; Wenjie Zhang,Top-k pairs queries have many real applications. k closest pairs queries; k furthest pairsqueries and their bichromatic variants are some of the examples of the top-k pairs queriesthat rank the pairs on distance functions. While these queries have received significantresearch attention; there does not exist a unified approach that can efficiently answer allthese queries. Moreover; there is no existing work that supports top-k pairs queries based ongeneric scoring functions. In this paper; we present a unified approach that supports a broadclass of top-k pairs queries including the queries mentioned above. Our proposed approachallows the users to define a local scoring function for each attribute involved in the query anda global scoring function that computes the final score of each pair by combining its scoreson different attributes. We propose efficient internal and external memory algorithms and …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,17
Taming computational complexity: Efficient and parallel simrank optimizations on undirected graphs,Weiren Yu; Xuemin Lin; Jiajin Le,Abstract SimRank has been considered as one of the promising link-based rankingalgorithms to evaluate similarities of web documents in many modern search engines. In thispaper; we investigate the optimization problem of SimRank similarity computation onundirected web graphs. We first present a novel algorithm to estimate the SimRank betweenvertices in O\left(n^3+K⋅n^2\right) time; where n is the number of vertices; and K is thenumber of iterations. In comparison; the most efficient implementation of SimRank algorithmin 1 takes O\left(K⋅n^3\right) time in the worst case. To efficiently handle large-scalecomputations; we also propose a parallel implementation of the SimRank algorithm onmultiple processors. The experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-life data setsdemonstrate the better computational time and parallel efficiency of our proposed …,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2010,17
Direct mesh: a multiresolution approach to terrain visualization,Kai Xu; Xiaofang Zhou; Xuemin Lin,Terrain can be approximated by a triangular mesh consisting millions of 3D points.Multiresolution triangular mesh (MTM) structures are designed to support applications thatuse terrain data at variable levels of detail (LOD). Typically; an MTM adopts a tree structurewhere a parent node represents a lower-resolution approximation of its descendants. Givena region of interest (ROI) and a LOD; the process of retrieving the required terrain data fromthe database is to traverse the MTM tree from the root to reach all the nodes satisfying theROI and LOD conditions. This process; while being commonly used for multiresolutionterrain visualization; is inefficient as either a large number of sequential I/O operations orfetching a large amount of extraneous data is incurred. Various spatial indexes have beenproposed in the past to address this problem; however level-by-level tree traversal …,Data Engineering; 2004. Proceedings. 20th International Conference on,2004,17

SimFusion+: extending simfusion towards efficient estimation on large and dynamic networks,Weiren Yu; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Ying Zhang; Jiajin Le,Abstract SimFusion has become a captivating measure of similarity between objects in aweb graph. It is iteratively distilled from the notion that" the similarity between two objects isreinforced by the similarity of their related objects". The existing SimFusion model usuallyexploits the Unified Relationship Matrix (URM) to represent latent relationships amongheterogeneous data; and adopts an iterative paradigm for SimFusion computation.However; due to the row normalization of URM; the traditional SimFusion model mayproduce the trivial solution; worse still; the iterative computation of SimFusion may notensure the global convergence of the solution. This paper studies the revision of this model;providing a full treatment from complexity to algorithms.(1) We propose SimFusion+ basedon a notion of the Unified Adjacency Matrix (UAM); a modification of the URM; to prevent …,Proceedings of the 35th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2012,16
Efficient algorithms to monitor continuous constrained k nearest neighbor queries,Mahady Hasan; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Wenyu Qu; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Continuous monitoring of spatial queries has received significant research attentionin the past few years. In this paper; we propose two efficient algorithms for the continuousmonitoring of the constrained k nearest neighbor (k NN) queries. In contrast to theconventional k nearest neighbors (k NN) queries; a constrained k NN query considers onlythe objects that lie within a region specified by some user defined constraints (eg; apolygon). Similar to the previous works; we also use grid-based data structure and proposetwo novel grid access methods. Our proposed algorithms are based on these accessmethods and guarantee that the number of cells that are accessed to compute theconstrained k NNs is minimal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our algorithms areseveral times faster than the previous algorithm and use considerably less memory.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,16
Quantile-based knn over multi-valued objects,Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Ying Zhang; Wei Wang,K Nearest Neighbor search has many applications including data mining; multi-media;image processing; and monitoring moving objects. In this paper; we study the problem ofKNN over multi-valued objects. We aim to provide effective and efficient techniques toidentify KNN sensitive to relative distributions of objects. We propose to use quantiles tosummarize relative-distribution-sensitive K nearest neighbors. Given a query Q and aquantile φ∈(0; 1]; we firstly study the problem of efficiently computing K nearest objectsbased on a φ-quantile distance (eg median distance) from each object to Q. The secondproblem is to retrieve the K nearest objects to Q based on overall distances in the “bestpopulation”(with a given size specified by φ-quantile) for each object. While the first problemcan be solved in polynomial time; we show that the 2nd problem is NP-hard. A set of …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,16

In this paper; we study theproblem of continuous k NN query on the dataset with an in-memory grid index. We firstpresent a novel data access method–CircularTrip.

Labeling Scheme and Structural Joins for Graph-Structured XML Data.,Hongzhi Wang; Wei Wang; Xuemin Lin; Jianzhong Li,Abstract When XML documents are modeled as graphs; many challenging research issuesarise. In particular; query processing for graph-structured XML data brings new challengesbecause traditional structural join methods cannot be directly applied. In this paper; wepropose a labeling scheme for graph-structured XML data. With this labeling scheme; thereachability relationship of two nodes can be judged efficiently without accessing othernodes. Based on this labeling scheme; we design efficient structural join algorithms toevaluate reachability queries. Experiments show that our algorithms have high efficiencyand good scalability.,APWeb,2005,16
Improving backward recovery in workflow systems,Chengfei Liu; Maria Orlowska; Xuemin Lin; Xiaofang Zhou,The notion of compensation is widely used as means of backward recovery in long-livedtransactions as well as in business processes supported by workflow management systems.In general; it is non-trivial to design compensating tasks for tasks in the context of a workflow.Actually; a task does not have to be compensatable. In this paper; we first look into therequirements that a compensating task has to satisfy. Then we introduce a new mechanismcalled confirmation. With the help of confirmation; we can modify some non-compensatabletasks so that they become compensatable. This greatly improves backward recovery forworkflow applications in the case of failures. To effectively incorporate confirmation andcompensation into the workflow management environment; a three-level bottom-up workflowdesign method is introduced.

Diversified top-k clique search,Long Yuan; Lu Qin; Xuemin Lin; Lijun Chang; Wenjie Zhang,Abstract Maximal clique enumeration is a fundamental problem in graph theory and hasbeen extensively studied. However; maximal clique enumeration is time-consuming in largegraphs and always returns enormous cliques with large overlaps. Motivated by this; in thispaper; we study the diversified top-k clique search problem which is to find top-k cliques thatcan cover most number of nodes in the graph. Diversified top-k clique search can be widelyused in a lot of applications including community search; motif discovery; and anomalydetection in large graphs. A naive solution for diversified top-k clique search is to keep allmaximal cliques in memory and then find k of them that cover most nodes in the graph byusing the approximate greedy max k-cover algorithm. However; such a solution isimpractical when the graph is large. In this paper; instead of keeping all maximal cliques …,The VLDB Journal,2016,15
Probabilistic skyline operator over sliding windows,Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Wei Wang; Gaoping Zhu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Skyline computation has many applications including multi-criteria decision making.In this paper; we study the problem of efficiently computing the skyline over sliding windowson uncertain data elements against probability thresholds. Firstly; we characterize theproperties of elements to be kept in our computation. Then; we show the size of dynamicallymaintained candidate set and the size of skyline. Novel; efficient techniques are developedto process continuous probabilistic skyline queries over sliding windows. Finally; we extendour techniques to cover the applications where multiple probability thresholds are given;“top-k” skyline data objects are retrieved; or elements have individual life-spans. Our extensiveexperiments demonstrate that the proposed techniques are very efficient and can handle ahigh-speed data stream in real time.,Information Systems,2013,15

Speedup Graph Processing by Graph Ordering,Hao Wei; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Can Lu; Xuemin Lin,Abstract The CPU cache performance is one of the key issues to efficiency in databasesystems. It is reported that cache miss latency takes a half of the execution time in databasesystems. To improve the CPU cache performance; there are studies to support searchingincluding cache-oblivious; and cache-conscious trees. In this paper; we focus on CPUspeedup for graph computing in general by reducing the CPU cache miss ratio for differentgraph algorithms. The approaches dealing with trees are not applicable to graphs which arecomplex in nature. In this paper; we explore a general approach to speed up CPUcomputing; in order to further enhance the efficiency of the graph algorithms withoutchanging the graph algorithms (implementations) and the data structures used.

I/o efficient core graph decomposition at web scale,Dong Wen; Lu Qin; Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Core decomposition is a fundamental graph problem with a large number of applications.Most existing approaches for core decomposition assume that the graph is kept in memoryof a machine. Nevertheless; many real-world graphs are big and may not reside in memory.In the literature; there is only one work for I/O efficient core decomposition that avoidsloading the whole graph in memory. However; this approach is not scalable to handle biggraphs because it cannot bound the memory size and may load most parts of the graph inmemory. In addition; this approach can hardly handle graph updates. In this paper; we studyI/O efficient core decomposition following a semi-external model; which only allows nodeinformation to be loaded in memory. This model works well in many web-scale graphs.

Searching dimension incomplete databases,Wei Cheng; Xiaoming Jin; Jian-Tao Sun; Xuemin Lin; Xiang Zhang; Wei Wang,Similarity query is a fundamental problem in database; data mining and information retrievalresearch. Recently; querying incomplete data has attracted extensive attention as it posesnew challenges to traditional querying techniques. The existing work on queryingincomplete data addresses the problem where the data values on certain dimensions areunknown. However; in many real-life applications; such as data collected by a sensornetwork in a noisy environment; not only the data values but also the dimension informationmay be missing. In this work; we propose to investigate the problem of similarity search ondimension incomplete data. A probabilistic framework is developed to model this problem sothat the users can find objects in the database that are similar to the query with probabilityguarantee. Missing dimension information poses great computational challenge; since all …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,14
Consensus-based ranking of multivalued objects: A generalized borda count approach,Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Jian Pei; Xuemin Lin; Qianlu Lin; Aiping Li,In this paper; we tackle a novel problem of ranking multivalued objects; where an object hasmultiple instances in a multidimensional space; and the number of instances per object isnot fixed. Given an ad hoc scoring function that assigns a score to a multidimensionalinstance; we want to rank a set of multivalued objects. Different from the existing models ofranking uncertain and probabilistic data; which model an object as a random variable andthe instances of an object are assumed exclusive; we have to capture the coexistence ofinstances here. To tackle the problem; we advocate the semantics of favoring widelypreferred objects instead of majority votes; which is widely used in many elections andcompetitions. Technically; we borrow the idea from Borda Count (BC); a well-recognizedmethod in consensus-based voting systems. However; Borda Count cannot handle …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,14
IRWR: incremental random walk with restart,Weiren Yu; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Random Walk with Restart (RWR) has become an appealing measure of nodeproximities in emerging applications\eg recommender systems and automatic imagecaptioning. In practice; a real graph is typically large; and is frequently updated with smallchanges. It is often cost-inhibitive to recompute proximities from scratch via\emph {batch}algorithms when the graph is updated. This paper focuses on the incremental computationsof RWR in a dynamic graph; whose edges often change over time. The prior attempt of RWR[1] deploys\kdash to find top-$ k $ highest proximity nodes for a given query; which involvesa strategy to incrementally\emph {estimate} upper proximity bounds. However; due to its aimto prune needless calculation; such an incremental strategy is\emph {approximate}: in $ O(1) $ time for each node.

Finding top k most influential spatial facilities over uncertain objects,Liming Zhan; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Due to a variety of reasons including data randomness and incompleteness; noise; privacy;etc.; uncertainty is inherent in many important applications; such as location-based services(LBS); sensor network monitoring; and radio-frequency identification (RFID). Recently;considerable research efforts have been devoted into the field of uncertainty-aware spatialquery processing such that the uncertainty of the data can be effectively and efficientlytackled. In this paper; we study the problem of finding top k most influential facilities over aset of uncertain objects; which is an important and fundamental spatial query in the aboveapplications. Based on the maximal utility principle; we propose a new ranking model toidentify the top k most influential facilities; which carefully captures influence of facilities onthe uncertain objects.

Cleaning structured event logs: A graph repair approach,Jianmin Wang; Shaoxu Song; Xuemin Lin; Xiaochen Zhu; Jian Pei,Event data are often dirty owing to various recording conventions or simply system errors.These errors may cause many serious damages to real applications; such as inaccurateprovenance answers; poor profiling results or concealing interesting patterns from eventdata. Cleaning dirty event data is strongly demanded. While existing event data cleaningtechniques view event logs as sequences; structural information do exist among events. Weargue that such structural information enhances not only the accuracy of repairinginconsistent events but also the computation efficiency. It is notable that both the structureand the names (labeling) of events could be inconsistent. In real applications; whileunsound structure is not repaired automatically (which needs manual effort from businessactors to handle the structure error); it is highly desirable to repair the inconsistent event …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,13
I/O efficient: computing SCCs in massive graphs,Zhiwei Zhang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lu Qin; Lijun Chang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract A strongly connected component (SCC SCC) is a maximal subgraph of a directedgraph GG in which every pair of nodes is reachable from each other in the SCC SCC. Withsuch a property; a general directed graph can be represented by a directed acyclic graph(DAG) by contracting every SCC SCC of GG to a node in DAG. In many real applications thatneed graph pattern matching; topological sorting; or reachability query processing; the bestway to deal with a general directed graph is to deal with its DAG representation. Therefore;finding all SCC SCC s in a directed graph GG is a critical operation. The existing in-memoryalgorithms based on depth first search (DFS) can find all SCC SCC s in linear time withrespect to the size of a graph. However; when a graph cannot reside entirely in the mainmemory; the existing external or semi-external algorithms to find all SCC SCC s have …,The VLDB Journal,2015,13
An iterative fusion approach to graph-based semi-supervised learning from multiple views,Yang Wang; Jian Pei; Xuemin Lin; Qing Zhang; Wenjie Zhang,Abstract Often; a data object described by many features can be naturally decomposed intomultiple “views”; where each view consists of a subset of features. For example; a video clipmay have a video view and an audio view. Given a set of training data objects with multipleviews; where some objects are labeled and the others are not; semi-supervised learningwith graphs from multi-views tries to learn a classifier by treating each view as a similaritygraph on all objects; where edges are defined by the similarity on object pairs based on theview attributes. Labels and label relevance ranking scores of labeled objects can bepropagated from labeled objects to unlabeled objects on the similarity graphs so that similarobjects receive similar labels.

Approximate processing of massive continuous quantile queries over high-speed data streams,Xuemin Lin; Jian Xu; Qing Zhang; Hongjun Lu; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xiaofang Zhou; Yidong Yuan,Quantile computation has many applications including data mining and financial dataanalysis. It has been shown that an/spl epsi/-approximate summary can be maintained sothat; given a quantile query (/spl phi/;/spl epsi/); the data item at rank/spl lceil//spl phi/N/splrceil/may be approximately obtained within the rank error precision/spl epsi/N over all N dataitems in a data stream or in a sliding window. However; scalable online processing ofmassive continuous quantile queries with different/spl phi/and/spl epsi/poses a newchallenge because the summary is continuously updated with new arrivals of data items. Inthis paper; first we aim to dramatically reduce the number of distinct query results bygrouping a set of different queries into a cluster so that they can be processed virtually as asingle query while the precision requirements from users can be retained.

Our first randomised algorithm can guarantee such a relativeerror precision∊ with confidence 1-\delta using O (1\_\in\frac {1}{2} 2 log 1d log∊^ 2N)space; where N is the number of data elements seen so far in a data stream. Then; a newone-scan space compression technique is developed.

Fast all-pairs SimRank assessment on large graphs and bipartite domains,Weiren Yu; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Julie A McCann,SimRank is a powerful model for assessing vertex-pair similarities in a graph. It follows theconcept that two vertices are similar if they are referenced by similar vertices. The prior work[18] exploits partial sums memoization to compute SimRank in O (Kmn) time on a graph of nvertices and m edges; for K iterations. However; computations among different partial sumsmay have redundancy. Besides; to guarantee a given accuracy ε; the existing SimRankneeds K=[log C alterations; where C is a damping factor; but the geometric rate ofconvergence is slow if a high accuracy is expected. In this paper;(1) a novel clusteringstrategy is proposed to eliminate duplicate computations occurring in partial sums; and anefficient algorithm is then devised to accelerate SimRank computation to O (Kd'n 2) time;where d'is typically much smaller than mn.(2) A new differential SimRank equation is …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,12

In this paper; we investigate a proximity matching problem amongclusters and features. The investigation involves proximity relationship measurementbetween clusters and features. We measure proximity in an average fashion to addresspossible non-uniform data distribution in a cluster. An efficient algorithm is proposed andevaluated to solve the problem.

On the computational complexity of edge concentration,Xuemin Lin,Abstract Suppose that G=(U; L; E) is a bipartite graph with vertex set U∪ L and edge set E⊆U× L. A typical convention for drawing G is to put the vertices of U on a horizontal line andthe vertices of L on another horizontal line; and then to represent edges by line segmentsbetween the vertices that determine them.“Edge concentration” is known as an effectivemethod to draw dense bipartite graphs clearly. The key in the edge concentration method isto reduce the number of edges; while the graph structural information is retained. Theproblem of having a maximal reduction on the number of edges by the edge concentrationmethod was left open. In this paper we show that this problem is NP-hard.,Discrete Applied Mathematics,2000,12
Learning Term Embeddings for Hypernymy Identification.,Zheng Yu; Haixun Wang; Xuemin Lin; Min Wang,Abstract Hypernymy identification aims at detecting if isA relationship holds between twowords or phrases. Most previous methods are based on lexical patterns or the DistributionalInclusion Hypothesis; and the accuracy of such methods is not ideal. In this paper; wepropose a simple yet effective supervision framework to identify hypernymy relations usingdistributed term representations (aka term embeddings).

Understanding Short Texts through Semantic Enrichment and Hashing,Zheng Yu; Haixun Wang; Xuemin Lin; Min Wang,Clustering short texts (such as news titles) by their meaning is a challenging task. Thesemantic hashing approach encodes the meaning of a text into a compact binary code.Thus; to tell if two texts have similar meanings; we only need to check if they have similarcodes. The encoding is created by a deep neural network; which is trained on textsrepresented by word-count vectors (bag-of-word representation). Unfortunately; for shorttexts such as search queries; tweets; or news titles; such representations are insufficient tocapture the underlying semantics. To cluster short texts by their meanings; we propose toadd more semantic signals to short texts. Specifically; for each term in a short text; we obtainits concepts and co-occurring terms from a probabilistic knowledge base to enrich the shorttext. Furthermore; we introduce a simplified deep learning network consisting of a 3-layer …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,10
Efficient computation of range aggregates against uncertain location-based queries,Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Yufei Tao; Wenjie Zhang; Haixun Wang,In many applications; including location-based services; queries may not be precise. In thispaper; we study the problem of efficiently computing range aggregates in a multidimensionalspace when the query location is uncertain. Specifically; for a query point Q whose locationis uncertain and a set S of points in a multidimensional space; we want to calculate theaggregate (eg; count; average and sum) over the subset S'of S such that for each p ϵ S'; Qhas at least probability θ within the distance γ to p. We propose novel; efficient techniques tosolve the problem following the filtering-and-verification paradigm.

Prefindex: An efficient supergraph containment search technique,Gaoping Zhu; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Wei Wang; Haichuan Shang,Abstract Graphs are prevailingly used in many applications to model complex datastructures. In this paper; we study the problem of supergraph containment search. To avoidthe NP-complete subgraph isomorphism test; most existing works follow the filtering-verification framework and select graph-features to build effective indexes; which filter falseresults (graphs) before conducting the costly verification. However; searching featuresmultiple times in the query graphs yields huge redundant computation; which leads to theemergence of the computation-sharing framework. This paper follows the roadmap ofcomputation-sharing framework to efficiently process supergraph containment queries.Firstly; database graphs are clustered into disjoint groups for sharing the computation costwithin each group. While it is shown NP-hard to maximize the computation-sharing …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2010,10
Probabilistic Threshold Range Aggregate Query Processing over Uncertain Data.,Shuxiang Yang; Wenjie Zhang; Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Large amount of uncertain data is inherent in many novel and importantapplications such as sensor data analysis and mobile data management. A probabilisticthreshold range aggregate (PTRA) query retrieves summarized information about theuncertain objects satisfying a range query; with respect to a given probability threshold. Thispaper is the first one to address this important type of query. We develop a new indexstructure aU-tree and propose an exact querying algorithm based on aU-tree. For the pursueof efficiency; two techniques SingleSample and DoubleSample are developed. Bothtechniques provide approximate answers to a PTRA query with accuracy guarantee.Experimental study demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed methods.,APWeb/WAIM,2009,10
Towards area requirements for drawing hierarchically planar graphs,Xuemin Lin; Peter Eades,Abstract Hierarchical graphs are an important class of graphs for modeling many realapplications in software and information visualization. In this paper; we investigate arearequirements for drawing hierarchically planar graphs regarding two different drawingstandards. Firstly; we show an exponential lower bound for the area needed for straight-linedrawing of hierarchically planar graphs. The lower bound holds even for st hierarchicalgraphs without transitive arcs; in contrast to the results for upward planar drawing. Thismotivates our investigation of another drawing standard grid visibility representation; as arelaxation of straight-line drawing. An application of the existing results from upward drawingcan guarantee a quadric drawing area for grid visibility representation but does notnecessarily guarantee the minimum drawing area. Motivated by this; we will present a …,Theoretical computer science,2003,10
$\mathsf {pSCAN} $: Fast and Exact Structural Graph Clustering,Lijun Chang; Wei Li; Lu Qin; Wenjie Zhang; Shiyu Yang,We study the problem of structural graph clustering; a fundamental problem in managingand analyzing graph data. Given an undirected unweighted graph; structural graphclustering is to assign vertices to clusters; and to identify the sets of hub vertices and outliervertices as well; such that vertices in the same cluster are densely connected to each otherwhile vertices in different clusters are loosely connected. In this paper; we develop a newtwo-step paradigm for scalable structural graph clustering based on our three observations.Then; we present a pSCAN approach; within the paradigm; aiming to reduce the number ofstructural similarity computations; and propose optimization techniques to speed upchecking whether two vertices are structure-similar. pSCAN outputs exactly the sameclusters as the existing approaches SCAN and SCAN++; and we prove that pSCAN is …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,9
Distance-aware influence maximization in geo-social network.,Xiaoyang Wang; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Influence maximization is a key problem in viral marketing. Given a social network G and apositive integer k; it aims to identify a seed set of k nodes in G that can maximize theexpected influence spread in a certain propagation model. With the proliferation of geo-social networks; location-aware product promotion is becoming more necessary in realapplications. However; the importance of the distance between users and the promotedlocation is underestimated in existing models. For instance; when opening a restaurant indowntown; through online promotion; the owner may expect to influence more customerswho are close to the restaurant; instead of people that are far away from it. In this paper; weformally define the distance-aware influence maximization problem; to find a seed set thatmaximizes the expected influence over users who are more likely to be the potential …,ICDE,2016,9
Summarizing level-two topological relations in large spatial datasets,Xuemin Lin; Qing Liu; Yidong Yuan; Xiaofang Zhou; Hongjun Lu,Abstract Summarizing topological relations is fundamental to many spatial applicationsincluding spatial query optimization. In this article; we present several novel techniques toeffectively construct cell density based spatial histograms for range (window)summarizations restricted to the four most important level-two topological relations: contains;contained; overlap; and disjoint. We first present a novel framework to construct a multiscaleEuler histogram in 2D space with the guarantee of the exact summarization results foraligned windows in constant time. To minimize the storage space in such a multiscale Eulerhistogram; an approximate algorithm with the approximate ratio 19/12 is presented; whilethe problem is shown NP-hard generally.

AP-Tree: efficiently support location-aware Publish/Subscribe,Xiang Wang; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Wei Wang,Abstract We investigate the problem of efficiently supporting location-awarePublish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub for short); which is essential in many applications such aslocation-based recommendation and advertising; thanks to the proliferation of geo-equippeddevices and the ensuing location-based social media applications. In a location-awarePub/Sub system (eg; an e-coupon system); subscribers can register their interest as spatial-keyword subscriptions (eg; interest in nearby iphone discount); each incoming geo-textualmessage (eg; geo-tagged e-coupon) will be delivered to all the relevant subscribersimmediately. While there are several prior approaches aiming at providing efficientprocessing techniques for this problem; their approaches belong to spatial-prioritizedindexing method which cannot well exploit the keyword distribution.

Index-based Optimal Algorithms for Computing Steiner Components with Maximum Connectivity,Lijun Chang; Xuemin Lin; Lu Qin; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Wenjie Zhang,Abstract With the proliferation of graph applications; the problem of efficiently computing all $k $-edge connected components of a graph G for a user-given k has been recentlyinvestigated. In this paper; we study the problem of efficiently computing the steinercomponent with the maximum connectivity; that is; given a set q of query vertices in a graphG; we aim to find the maximum induced subgraph g of G such that g contains q and g hasthe maximum connectivity; where g is denoted as SMCC. To accommodate online queryprocessing; we present an efficient algorithm based on a novel index such that the algorithmruns in linear time regarding the result size; thus; the algorithm is optimal since it needs atleast linear time to output the result. Moreover; in this paper we also investigate variations ofthe above problem.

An efficient processing of a chain join with the minimum communication cost in distributed database systems,Xuemin Lin; Maria E Orlowska,Abstract This paper investigates the optimization problem when executing a join in adistributed database environment. The minimization of the communication cost for sendingdata through links has been adopted as an optimization criterion. We explore in this paperthe approach of judiciously using join operations as reducers in distributed queryprocessing. In general; this problem is computationally intractable. A restriction of theexecution of a join in a pre-defined combinatorial order leads to a possible solution inpolynomial time. An algorithm for a chain query computation has been proposed in [21]. Thetime complexity of the algorithm is O (m 2 n 2+ m 3 n); where n is the number of sites in thenetwork; and m is the number of relations (fragments) involved in the join. In this paper; wefirstly present a proof of the intuitively well understood fact—that the “eigenorder” of a “ …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,1995,8
Database placement in communication networks for minimizing the overall transmission cost,X-M Lin; ME Orlowska; Y-C Zhang,Abstract The minimum spanning tree write policy for the maintenance of the consistency of adistributed database; where replicated data exist; has been proposed in [1]. In this paper; wefirst present a data placement heuristic algorithm in general networks for minimizing theoverall transmission cost for processing the typical demands of queries (by a “simple”process strategy) and updates (by the minimum spanning tree write policy). Severalinteresting optimality estimation results of this algorithm are shown; while the computationalintractability of the complete optimization; with respect to the simple strategy; is shown aswell. Secondly; we apply a classical climbing hill technique to obtain a dynamic databaseplacement algorithm based on an employed optimizer—a collection of distributed queryprocess algorithms.

Bring order into the samples: A novel scalable method for influence maximization,Xiaoyang Wang; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Chen Chen,As a key problem in viral marketing; influence maximization has been extensively studied inthe literature. Given a positive integer k; a social network g and a certain propagation model;it aims to find a set of k nodes that have the largest influence spread. The state-of-the-artmethod IMM is based on the reverse influence sampling (RIS) framework. By using themartingale technique; it greatly outperforms the previous methods in efficiency. However;IMM still has limitations in scalability due to the high overhead of deciding a tight samplesize. In this paper; instead of spending the effort on deciding a tight sample size; we presenta novel bottom-ksketch based RIS framework; namely BKRIS; which brings the order ofsamples into the RIS framework. By applying the sketch technique; we can derive earlytermination conditions to significantly accelerate the seed set selection procedure …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,7
Scalable distributed subgraph enumeration,Longbin Lai; Lu Qin; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Lijun Chang; Shiyu Yang,Abstract Subgraph enumeration aims to find all the subgraphs of a large data graph that areisomorphic to a given pattern graph. As the subgraph isomorphism operation iscomputationally intensive; researchers have recently focused on solving this problem indistributed environments; such as MapReduce and Pregel. Among them; the state-of-the-artalgorithm; Twin TwigJoin; is proven to be instance optimal based on a left-deep joinframework. However; it is still not scalable to large graphs because of the constraints in theleft-deep join framework and that each decomposed component (join unit) must be a star. Inthis paper; we propose SEED-a scalable sub-graph enumeration approach in the distributedenvironment. Compared to Twin TwigJoin; SEED returns optimal solution in a generalizedjoin framework without the constraints in Twin TwigJoin. We use both star and clique as …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,7
Computing connected components with linear communication cost in pregel-like systems,Xing Feng; Lijun Chang; Xuemin Lin; Lu Qin; Wenjie Zhang,The paper studies two fundamental problems in graph analytics: computing ConnectedComponents (CCs) and computing BiConnected Components (BCCs) of a graph. With therecent advent of Big Data; developing effcient distributed algorithms for computing CCs andBCCs of a big graph has received increasing interests. As with the existing research efforts;in this paper we focus on the Pregel programming model; while the techniques may beextended to other programming models including MapReduce and Spark. The state-of-the-art techniques for computing CCs and BCCs in Pregel incur O (m×# supersteps) total costsfor both data communication and computation; where m is the number of edges in a graphand# supersteps is the number of supersteps.

Finding the minimum spatial keyword cover,Dong-Wan Choi; Jian Pei; Xuemin Lin,The existing works on spatial keyword search focus on finding a group of spatial objectscovering all the query keywords and minimizing the diameter of the group. However; weobserve that such a formulation may not address what users need in some applicationscenarios. In this paper; we introduce a novel spatial keyword cover problem (SK-COVERfor short); which aims to identify the group of spatio-textual objects covering all keywords in aquery and minimizing a distance cost function that leads to fewer proximate objects in theanswer set. We prove that SK-COVER is not only NP-hard but also does not allow anapproximation better than O (log m) in polynomial time; where m is the number of querykeywords. We establish an O (log m)-approximation algorithm; which is asymptoticallyoptimal in terms of the approximability of SK-COVER. Furthermore; we devise effective …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,7

For instance; nowadays many people are used to sharinginteresting experience through Foursquare or Twitter along their travel routes. In this paper;we investigate the problem of spatial keyword range search on trajectories; which isessential to make sense of large amount of trajectory data. To the best of our knowledge; thisis the first work to systematically investigate range search over trajectories where threeimportant aspects; ie; spatio; temporal and textual; are all taken into consideration. Given aquery region; a timespan and a set of keywords; we aim to retrieve trajectories that gothrough this region during query timespan; and contain all the query keywords.

Selectivity estimation on streaming spatio-textual data using local correlations,Xiaoyang Wang; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Wei Wang,Abstract In this paper; we investigate the selectivity estimation problem for streaming spatio-textual data; which arises in many social network and geo-location applications. Specifically;given a set of continuously and rapidly arriving spatio-textual objects; each of which isdescribed by a geo-location and a short text; we aim to accurately estimate the cardinality ofa spatial keyword query on objects seen so far; where a spatial keyword query consists of asearch region and a set of query keywords. To the best of our knowledge; this is the firstwork to address this important problem. We first extend two existing techniques to solve thisproblem; and show their limitations. Inspired by two key observations on the" locality" of thecorrelations among query keywords; we propose a local correlation based method byutilizing an augmented adaptive space partition tree (A 2 SP-tree for short) to …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,7
Asymmetric signature schemes for efficient exact edit similarity query processing,Jianbin Qin; Wei Wang; Chuan Xiao; Yifei Lu; Xuemin Lin; Haixun Wang,Abstract Given a query string Q; an edit similarity search finds all strings in a databasewhose edit distance with Q is no more than a given threshold τ. Most existing methodsanswering edit similarity queries employ schemes to generate string subsequences assignatures and generate candidates by set overlap queries on query and data signatures. Inthis article; we show that for any such signature scheme; the lower bound of the minimumnumber of signatures is τ &plus; 1; which is lower than what is achieved by existing methods.We then propose several asymmetric signature schemes; that is; extracting differentnumbers of signatures for the data and query strings; which achieve this lower bound. Abasic asymmetric scheme is first established on the basis of matching q-chunks and q-gramsbetween two strings.

Similarity query processing for probabilistic sets,Ming Gao; Cheqing Jin; Wei Wang; Xuemin Lin; Aoying Zhou,Evaluating similarity between sets is a fundamental task in computer science. However;there are many applications in which elements in a set may be uncertain due to variousreasons. Existing work on modeling such probabilistic sets and computing their similaritiessuffers from huge model sizes or significant similarity evaluation cost; and hence is onlyapplicable to small probabilistic sets. In this paper; we propose a simple yet expressivemodel that supports many applications where one probabilistic set may have thousands ofelements. We define two types of similarities between two probabilistic sets using thepossible world semantics; they complement each other in capturing the similaritydistributions in the cross product of possible worlds. We design efficient dynamicprogramming-based algorithms to calculate both types of similarities. Novel individual …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,7

Further; we can show that the algorithm takes a logarithmicmemory space in 2 D-space in the worst case if there are not many intersections in anadopted R-tree. Our experiment demonstrated that the new algorithm is more scalable andefficient than the existing techniques especially in a low dimensional space.

In thispaper; we investigate the problem of selectivity estimation in the context of a spatial dataset.Specifically; we focus on the calculation of four relations; contains; contained; overlap anddisjoint; between data objects and a query rectangle using Euler-histograms. We firstprovide a multi-resolution algorithm which can lead to the exact solutions but at the cost ofstorage space. To conform to a given storage space; we also provide an approximatealgorithm based on a hybrid multi-resolution paradigm. Our experiments suggest that ouralgorithms greatly outperform the existing techniques.,Proceedings of the 14th Australasian database conference-Volume 17,2003,7

Quorum consensus is one of the popular methods;combining with eager replication; for managing replicated data. In this paper; we willinvestigate the problems of delay-optimal quorum consensus. Firstly; we will show that theproblem of minimizing the total-delay (or mean-delay) is NPhard. However; we can showthat the problem restricted to some specific network topology; such as trees; rings; andmeshes; can be solved in polynomial time. We also developed an approximate algorithm fora general case. The algorithm gives an approximate ratio less than 2.

In the presence of globaldeadlocks in a multidatabase system; this algorithm always selects an optimal set of victimsfor removing deadlocks. It makes use of network flow techniques; and runs in time O (n/sup3/); where n is the number of the deadlocked global transactions.

Answering subgraph queries over massive disk resident graphs,Peng Peng; Lei Zou; Lei Chen; Xuemin Lin; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract Due to its wide applications; subgraph query has attracted lots of attentions indatabase community. In this paper; we focus on subgraph query over a single large graph G;ie; finding all embeddings of query Q in G. Different from existing feature-based approaches;we map all edges into a two-dimensional space R 2 and propose a bitmap structure to indexR 2. At run time; we find a set of a djacent e dge p airs (AEP) or s tar-s tyle p atterns (SSP) tocover Q. We develop e dge j oin (EJ) algorithms to address both AEP and SSP subqueries.Based on the bitmap index; our method can optimize I/O and CPU cost. More importantly;our index has the linear space complexity instead of exponential complexity in feature-based approaches; which indicates that our index can scale well with respect to large datasize.

Optimal enumeration: Efficient top-k tree matching,Lijun Chang; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Ying Zhang; Lu Qin,Abstract Driven by many real applications; graph pattern matching has attracted a great dealof attention recently. Consider that a twig-pattern matching may result in an extremely largenumber of matches in a graph; this may not only confuse users by providing too many resultsbut also lead to high computational costs. In this paper; we study the problem of top-k treepattern matching; that is; given a rooted tree T; compute its top-k matches in a directed graphG based on the twig-pattern matching semantics. We firstly present a novel and optimalenumeration paradigm based on the principle of Lawler's procedure. We show that ourenumeration algorithm runs in O (n T+ log k) time in each round where n T is the number ofnodes in T. Considering that the time complexity to output a match of T is O (n T) and n T≥log k in practice; our enumeration technique is optimal.

Loyalty-based selection: Retrieving objects that persistently satisfy criteria,Zhitao Shen; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin,Abstract A traditional query returns a set of objects that satisfy user defined criteria at thetime query was issued. The results are based on the values of objects at query time and maybe affected by outliers. Intuitively; an object better meets the user's needs if it persistentlysatisfies the criteria; ie; it satisfies the criteria for majority of the time in the past T time units.In this paper; we propose a measure named loyalty that reflects how persistently an objectsatisfies the criteria. Formally; the loyalty of an object is the total time (in past T time units) itsatisfies the query criteria. In this paper; we study top-k loyalty queries over sliding windowsthat continuously report k objects with the highest loyalties. Each object issues an updatewhen it starts satisfying the criteria or when it stops satisfying the criteria. We show that thelower bound cost of updating the results of a top-k loyalty query is O (logN); for each …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,6

Efficient top-k similarity join processing over multi-valued objects,Wenjie Zhang; Liming Zhan; Ying Zhang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin,Abstract The top-k similarity joins have been extensively studied and used in a widespectrum of applications such as information retrieval; decision making; spatial data analysisand data mining. Given two sets of objects \mathcalU and \mathcalV; a top-k similarity joinreturns k pairs of most similar objects from \mathcalU*\mathcalV. In the conventional modelof top-k similarity join processing; an object is usually regarded as a point in a multi-dimensional space and the similarity is measured by some simple distance metrics likeEuclidean distance. However; in many applications an object may be described by multiplevalues (instances) and the conventional model is not applicable since it does not addressthe distributions of object instances.

Efficiently monitoring reverse k-nearest neighbors in spatial networks,Shenlu Wang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Given a set of clients C; a set of facilities F and a query q∈ F; a reverse k-nearestneighbor (R k NN) query retrieves every client c∈ C for which q is one of the k closestfacilities. In the past few years; R k NN queries have received significant research attentiondue to their wide range of applications. In this paper; we study the problem of continuousmonitoring of R k NN queries in road networks. The state-of-the-art technique is sensitivetoward the movement of clients; eg whenever a client that is inside the so-called unprunedregion changes its location; the existing technique requires expensive verification of whetherthe client is an R k NN of q or not. To address this problem; we utilize the novel concept ofinfluence zone; which is a region in the network such that a client c is the R k NN if and onlyif it lies inside this zone.

Keyword search on relational databases,Wei Wang; Xuemin Lin; Yi Luo,Recent years have seen increasing interest in the search technology. For example; searchengines like Google have become the dominant avenue of obtaining information from theInternet. One of the factors that led to the success of search engines is that they adopt thekeyword-based search paradigm: users submit keywords to search engines and a rankedlist of relevant documents is returned. This enables even unsophisticated users to obtaininformation without detailed knowledge of the database schema or query languages. Whiletraditional relational database systems (RDBMSs) store the majority amount of the world'senterprise data; they provide only limited support for keyword search. Specifically; they onlysearch for single tuples that match all the query keywords. A few recent studies haverecognized the need to dynamically grouping the individual matching tuples to form …,Network and Parallel Computing Workshops,2007,5

It has several equivalent variations [8; 17; 30].Rank queries over data streams have been investigated in the form of quantile computation.A &phis;-quantile (&phis;∈(0; 1]) of a collection of N data elements is the element with rank[&phis; N] against a monotonic order specified on data elements.

In this paper; we shall investigate thecomputational complexity of constructing minimum area grid visibility representations ofhierarchically planar graphs. Firstly; we provide a quadratic algorithm that minimizes thedrawing area with respect to a fixed planar embedding. This implies that the areaminimization problem is polynomial time solvable restricted to the class of graphs whoseplanar embeddings are unique. Secondly; we show that the area minimization problem isgenerally NP-hard.,Lecture notes in computer science,1999,5

In this paper; we present a new QC method.The proposed QC method is highly fault-tolerant; and fully distributed (ie; each site in adistributed system is equally weighted). Further; we can show that the proposed QC methodhas a low message overhead: 1.(1) In the best case; each transaction operation processneeds only to communicate with Ω (√ n) remote sites to get permission (n is the number ofsites storing replicated copies of the manipulating data item). 2.(2) In the worst case; eachtransaction operation process may be forced to communicate with Ω (√ n log n) remote sitesdue to site failures. We also compare our method with the existing QC methods.,Theoretical Computer Science,1997,5
Area requirements for drawing hierarchically planar graphs,Xuemin Lin; Peter Eades,Abstract In this paper; we investigate area requirements for drawing st hierarchically planargraphs by straight-lines. Two drawing standards will be discussed: 1) each vertex isrepresented by a point and 2) grid visibility representation (that is; a line segment is allowedto represent a vertex). For the first drawing standard; we show an exponential area lowerbound needed for drawing hierarchically planar graphs. The lower bound holds even forhierarchical graphs without transitive arcs; in contrast to the results for upward planardrawing. Applications of some existing algorithms from upward drawing can guarantee thequadratic drawing area for grid visibility representation but do not necessarily guarantee theminimum drawing area. Motivated by this; we will present another grid visibility drawingalgorithm which is efficient and guarantees the minimum drawing area.,Graph Drawing,1997,5
I/O efficient ECC graph decomposition via graph reduction,Long Yuan; Lu Qin; Xuemin Lin; Lijun Chang; Wenjie Zhang,Abstract The problem of computing k-edge connected components (k-ECCs) of a graph G fora specific k is a fundamental graph problem and has been investigated recently. In thispaper; we study the problemof ECC decomposition; which computes the k-ECCs of a graphG for all k values. ECC decomposition can be widely applied in a variety of applications suchas graph-topology analysis; community detection; Steiner component search; and graphvisualization. A straightforward solution for ECC decomposition is to apply the existing k-ECC computation algorithm to compute the k-ECCs for all k values. However; this solution isnot applicable to large graphs for two challenging reasons. First; all existing k-ECCcomputation algorithms are highly memory intensive due to the complex data structuresused in the algorithms. Second; the number of possible k values can be very large …,The VLDB Journal,2017,4
Efficient Distance-Aware Influence Maximization in Geo-Social Networks,Xiaoyang Wang; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Given a social network and a positive integer k; the influence maximization problem aims toidentify a set of k nodes in that can maximize the influence spread under a certainpropagation model. As the proliferation of geo-social networks; location-aware promotion isbecoming more necessary in real applications. In this paper; we study the distance-awareinfluence maximization (DAIM) problem; which advocates the importance of the distancebetween users and the promoted location. Unlike the traditional influence maximizationproblem; DAIM treats users differently based on their distances from the promoted location.In this situation; the k nodes selected are different when the promoted location varies. Inorder to handle the large number of queries and meet the online requirement; we developtwo novel index-based approaches; MIA-DA and RIS-DA; by utilizing the information over …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,4
Efficiently computing reverse k furthest neighbors,Shenlu Wang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Dongxi Liu,Given a set of facilities F; a set of users U and a query facility q; a reverse k furthestneighbors (RkFN) query retrieves every user u∈ U for which q is one of its k-furthestfacilities. RkFN query is the natural complement of reverse k-nearest neighbors (RkNN)query that returns every user u for which q is one of its k-nearest facilities. While RkNN queryreturns the users that are highly influenced by a query q; RkFN query aims at finding theusers that are least influenced by a query q. RkFN query has many applications in location-based services; marketing; facility location; clustering; and recommendation systems etc.While there exist several algorithms that answer RkFN query for k= 1; we are the first topropose a solution for arbitrary value of k. Based on several interesting observations; wepresent an efficient algorithm to process the RkFN queries. We also present a rigorous …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,4
Efficiently identify local frequent keyword co-occurrence patterns in geo-tagged Twitter stream,Xiaoyang Wang; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract With the prevalence of the geo-position enabled devices and services; a rapidlygrowing amount of tweets are associated with geo-tags. Consequently; the real time searchon geo-tagged Twitter streams has attracted great attentions. In this paper; we advocate thesignificance of the co-occurrence of keywords for the geo-tagged tweets data analytics;which is overlooked by existing studies. Particularly; we formally introduce the problem ofidentifying local frequent keyword co-occurrence patterns over the geo-tagged Twitterstreams; namely LFP\xspace query. To accommodate the high volume and the rapidupdates of the Twitter stream; we develop an inverted KMV sketch (IK\xspace sketch forshort) structure to capture the co-occurrence of keywords in limited space. Then efficientalgorithms are developed based on IK\xspace sketch to support LFP\xspace queries as …,Proceedings of the 37th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research & development in information retrieval,2014,4

In recent years; we have witnessed significant researchefforts devoted to producing probabilistic database management systems; and manyimportant queries are re-investigated in the context of uncertain data models. In the paper;we study the problem of top k dominating query on multi-dimensional uncertain objects;which is an essential method in the multi-criteria decision analysis when an explicit scoringfunction is not available. Particularly; we formally introduce the top k dominating modelbased on the state-of-the-art top k semantic over uncertain data. We also propose effectiveand efficient algorithms to identify the top k dominating objects. Novel pruning techniques …,DASFAA (1),2014,4
Counting distinct objects over sliding windows,Wenjie Zhang; Ying Zhang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Aggregation against distinct objects has been involved in many real applicationswith the presence of duplicates; including real-time monitoring moving objects. In this paper;we investigate the problem of counting distinct objects over sliding windows with arbitrarylengths. We present novel; time and space efficient; one scan algorithms to continuouslymaintain a sketch so that the counting can be approximately conducted with a relative errorguarantee ε in the presence of object duplicates.

While KPJis an extension of the problem of computing the top-k shortest paths (KSP) between twotarget nodes; the existing technique by converting KPJ to KSP has several deficiencies inconducting the computation. To resolve these; we propose to use the best-first paradigm torecursively divide search subspaces into smaller subspaces; and to compute the shortestpath in each of the subspaces in a prioritized order based on their lower bounds.Consequently; we only compute shortest paths in subspaces whose lower bounds are largerthan the length of the current k-th shortest path.

In this paper; we present a unified framework foranswering generic top-$ k $ pairs queries including $ k $-closest pairs queries; $ k $-furthestpairs queries and their variants. Note that $ k $-closest pairs query is a special case of top-$k $ pairs queries where the scoring function is the distance between the two objects in apair. We are the first to present a unified framework to efficiently answer a broad class of top-$ k $ queries including the queries mentioned above. We present efficient algorithms andprovide a detailed theoretical analysis that demonstrates that the expected performance ofour proposed algorithms is optimal for two dimensional data sets.

Improving Performance of Graph Similarity Joins Using Selected Substructures.,Xiang Zhao; Chuan Xiao; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Jiuyang Tang,Abstract Similarity join of complex structures is an important operation in managing graphdata. In this paper; we investigate the problem of graph similarity join with edit distanceconstraints. Existing algorithms extract substructures–either rooted trees or simple paths–asfeatures; and transform the edit distance constraint into a weaker count filtering condition.However; the performance suffers from the heavy overlapping or low selectivity ofsubstructures. To resolve the issue; we first present a general framework for substructure-based similarity join and a tighter count filtering condition. It is observed under theframework that using either too few or too many substructures can result in poor filteringperformance. Thus; we devise an algorithm to select substructures for filtering. The proposedtechniques are integrated into the framework; constituting a new algorithm; whose …,DASFAA (1),2014,3
DuoWave: Mitigating the curse of dimensionality for uncertain data,Chunyang Ma; Rui Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Gang Chen,Abstract The curse of dimensionality has been a vexatious obstacle in processing querieson multidimensional data. This problem is more serious with uncertain data: an uncertainobject's value may spread extensively in the data space with varying probability distribution.In this paper; we attack this challenging problem and propose a technique called DuoWavefor indexing uncertain multidimensional objects under a commonly used data model. Wepropose efficient algorithms to process range queries; the most popular filtering paradigm formany multidimensional queries on uncertain data. Extensive experiments show thatDuoWave significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover; DuoWave canalso be exploited for a number of other query types on uncertain data.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2012,3
Human action recognition from video sequences by enforcing tri-view constraints,Yang Wang; Lin Wu; Xiaodi Huang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Two-view methods have been well developed to identify human actions. However;in a case where the corresponding imaged points cannot induce distinguished measures;the performance of the methods deteriorates. For this reason; we propose a new view-invariant measure for human action recognition by enforcing tri-view constraints in thispaper. This new measurement method can be tolerant to different rates of human actionsand the anthropometric proportions. We apply our approach to video synchronization byimposing both the similarity ratio and the consistency in the trifocal tensor over entire videosequences. By testing on both synthetic and real data; our method has achieved highertolerance to noise levels; as well as higher identification accuracy than the traditional two-view method. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can identify human …,The Computer Journal,2011,3

Efficient computation of k-medians over data streams under memory constraints,Zhi-Hong Chong; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Zhen-Jie Zhang; Xue-Min Lin; Wei Wang; Ao-Ying Zhou,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of efficiently computing k-medians over high-dimensional and high speed data streams. The focus of this paper is on the issue ofminimizing CPU time to handle high speed data streams on top of the requirements of highaccuracy and small memory. Our work is motivated by the following observation: the existingalgorithms have similar approximation behaviors in practice; even though they makenoticeably different worst case theoretical guarantees. The underlying reason is that in orderto achieve high approximation level with the smallest possible memory; they need rathercomplex techniques to maintain a sketch; along time dimension; by using some existing off-line clustering algorithms. Those clustering algorithms cannot guarantee the optimalclustering result over data segments in a data stream but accumulate errors over …,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2006,3

Graph partition based multi-way spatial joins,Xuemin Lin; Hai-Xin Lu; Qing Zhang,We investigate the problem of efficiently computing a multi-way spatial join without spatialindexes. We propose a novel and effective filtering algorithm based on a two phasepartitioning technique. To avoid missing hits due to an inherent difficulty in multi-way spatialjoins; we propose to firstly partition a join graph into sub-graphs whenever necessary. In thesecond phase; we partition the spatial data sets; and then the sub-joins will be executedsimultaneously in each partition to minimise the I/O costs. Finally; a multi-way relational joinis applied to merge together the sub-join results. Our experiment results demonstrate theeffectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2002. Proceedings. International,2002,3

Using parallel semi-join reduction to minimize distributed query response time,Xuemin Lin; Maria E Orlowskat; Xiaofang Zhou,A one-shot semi-join reduction approach was recently proposed to execute all semi-joins onthe same relation simultaneously such that the relation only needs to be scanned once. Theone-shot semi-join reduction approach was applied to reducing distributed query responsetime under the assumption that one copy of each referenced relation has been chosen priorto the production of an execution plan. The estimations of both semi-join reduction effect andlocal join cost; employed in previous work; were restricted to a special case. In this paper;we extend the previous work in three ways:(1) remove the requirement for copy selectionbefore the production of a semi-join reduction program;(2) allow the choice of redundantcopies for the execution of semi-joins;(3) employ a general cost model which covers a largeclass of possible estimations of semi-join reduction effect and local join cost.

In order to perform the time out mechanism better; we propose an optimal victimselection algorithm for resolving global deadlock in a multidatabase system. The algorithmselects a set of transactions with the minimal abortion cost to resolve global deadlocks.

Scalable subgraph enumeration in MapReduce: a cost-oriented approach,Longbin Lai; Lu Qin; Xuemin Lin; Lijun Chang,Abstract Subgraph enumeration; which aims to find all the subgraphs of a large data graphthat are isomorphic to a given pattern graph; is a fundamental graph problem with a widerange of applications. However; existing sequential algorithms for subgraph enumeration fallshort in handling large graphs due to the involvement of computationally intensive subgraphisomorphism operations. Thus; some recent researches focus on solving the problem usingMapReduce. Nevertheless; exiting MapReduce approaches are not scalable to handle verylarge graphs since they either produce a huge number of partial results or consume a largeamount of memory. Motivated by this; in this paper; we propose a new algorithm Twin TwinTwig Twig Join Join based on a left-deep-join framework in MapReduce; in which the basicjoin unit is a Twin Twin Twig Twig (an edge or two incident edges of a node).

Matching dominance: capture the semantics of dominance for multi-dimensional uncertain objects,Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Chengqi Zhang,Abstract The dominance operator plays an important role in a wide spectrum of multi-criteriadecision making applications. Generally speaking; a dominance operator is a partial orderon a set O of objects; and we say the dominance operator has the monotonic propertyregarding a family of ranking functions F if o 1 dominates o 2 implies f (o 1)≥ f (o 2) for anyranking function f∈ F and objects o 1; o 2∈ O. The dominance operator on the multi-dimensional points is well defined; which has the monotonic property regarding anymonotonic ranking (scoring) function. Due to the uncertain nature of data in many emergingapplications; a variety of existing works have studied the semantics of ranking query onuncertain objects. However; the problem of dominance operator against multi-dimensionaluncertain objects remains open.

Top-k Similarity Join over Multi-valued Objects.,Wenjie Zhang; Jing Xu; Xin Liang; Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract The top-k similarity joins have been extensively studied and used in a widespectrum of applications such as information retrieval; decision making; spatial data analysisand data mining. Given two sets of objects \mathcalU and \mathcalV; a top-k similarity joinreturns k pairs of most similar objects from \mathcalU*\mathcalV. In the conventional modelof top-k similarity join processing; an object is usually regarded as a point in a multi-dimensional space and the similarity between two objects is usually measured by distancemetrics such as Euclidean distance. However; in many applications an object may bedescribed by multiple values (instances) and the conventional model is not applicable sinceit does not address the distributions of object instances.

On the efficiency of estimating penetrating rank on large graphs,Weiren Yu; Jiajin Le; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang,Abstract P-Rank (Penetrating Rank) has been suggested as a useful measure of structuralsimilarity that takes account of both incoming and outgoing edges in ubiquitous networks.Existing work often utilizes memoization to compute P-Rank similarity in an iterative fashion;which requires cubic time in the worst case. Besides; previous methods mainly focus on thedeterministic computation of P-Rank; but lack the probabilistic framework that scales well forlarge graphs. In this paper; we propose two efficient algorithms for computing P-Rank onlarge graphs. The first observation is that a large body of objects in a real graph usuallyshare similar neighborhood structures. By merging such objects with an explicit low-rankfactorization; we devise a deterministic algorithm to compute P-Rank in quadratic time. Thesecond observation is that by converting the iterative form of P-Rank into a matrix power …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2012,2
Probabilistic ranking over relations,Lijun Chang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lu Qin; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Probabilistic top-k ranking queries have been extensively studied due to the factthat data obtained can be uncertain in many real applications. A probabilistic top-k rankingquery ranks objects by the interplay of score and probability; with an implicit assumption thatboth scores based on which objects are ranked and probabilities of the existence of theobjects are stored in the same relation. We observe that in general scores and probabilitiesare highly possible to be stored in different relations; for example; in column-orientedDBMSs and in data warehouses. In this paper we study probabilistic top-k ranking querieswhen scores and probabilities are stored in different relations. We focus on reducing the joincost in probabilistic top-k ranking.

Practical indexing XML document for twig query,Hongzhi Wang; Wei Wang; Jianzhong Li; Xuemin Lin; Reymond Wong,Abstract Answering structural queries of XML with index is an important approach of efficientXML query processing. Among existing structural indexes for XML data; F&B index is thesmallest index that can answer all branching queries. However; an F&B index for lessregular XML data often contains a large number of index nodes; and hence a large amountof main memory. If the F&B index cannot be accommodated in the available memory; itsperformance will degrade significantly. This issue has practically limited wider application ofthe F&B index. In this paper; we propose a disk organization method for the F&B index whichshift part of the leave nodes in the F&B index to the disk and organize them judiciously onthe disk. Our method is based on the observation that the majority of the nodes in a F&Bindex is often the leaf nodes; yet their access frequencies are not high.

When engagement meets similarity: efficient (k; r)-core computation on social networks,Fan Zhang; Ying Zhang; Lu Qin; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract In this paper; we investigate the problem of (k; r)-core which intends to find cohesivesubgraphs on social networks considering both user engagement and similarityperspectives. In particular; we adopt the popular concept of k-core to guarantee theengagement of the users (vertices) in a group (subgraph) where each vertex in a (k; r)-coreconnects to at least k other vertices. Meanwhile; we consider the pairwise similarity amongusers based on their attributes. Efficient algorithms are proposed to enumerate all maximal(k; r)-cores and find the maximum (k; r)-core; where both problems are shown to be NP-hard.Effective pruning techniques substantially reduce the search space of two algorithms. Anovel (k; k')-core based (k; r)-core size upper bound enhances performance of the maximum(k; r)-core computation.

Leveraging set relations in exact set similarity join,Xubo Wang; Lu Qin; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Lijun Chang,Abstract Exact set similarity join; which finds all the similar set pairs from two collections ofsets; is a fundamental problem with a wide range of applications. The existing solutions forset similarity join follow a filtering-verification framework; which generates a list of candidatepairs through scanning indexes in the filtering phase; and reports those similar pairs in theverification phase. Though much research has been conducted on this problem; setrelations; which we find out is quite effective on improving the algorithm efficiency throughcomputational cost sharing; have never been studied. Therefore; in this paper; instead ofconsidering each set individually; we explore the set relations in different levels to reducethe overall computational costs. First; it has been shown that most of the computational timeis spent on the filtering phase; which can be quadratic to the number of sets in the worst …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,1
Scalable Top-K Structural Diversity Search,Lijun Chang; Chen Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Lu Qin,This paper studies the problem of top-k structural diversity search; which is to compute kusers with the highest structural diversities that is measured by the number of connectedcomponents in the neighborhood of a user. As the existing algorithms are not scalable forprocessing large graphs due to their limits; in this paper we propose a scalable algorithmDiv-TriE to improve the e ciency. Div-TriE has two optimal features compared with theexisting algorithms. Firstly; we show that as a key building block; we only need to enumerateeach triangle at most once in Div-TriE; in contrast to the up-to three times in the existingtechniques. Secondly; we develop e cient techniques so that the computation against eachenumerated triangle is (amortized) constant; in contrast to the non-constant costs in thecorresponding costs of the existing techniques.

Reverse k nearest neighbors queries and spatial reverse top-k queries,Shiyu Yang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang,Abstract Given a set of facilities and a set of users; a reverse k nearest neighbors (R k NN)query q returns every user for which the query facility is one of the k closest facilities. Almostall of the existing techniques to answer R k NN queries adopt a pruning-and-verificationframework. Regions-based pruning and half-space pruning are the two most notablepruning strategies. The half-space-based approach prunes a larger area and is generallybelieved to be superior. Influenced by this perception; almost all existing R k NN algorithmsutilize and improve the half-space pruning strategy. We observe the weaknesses andstrengths of both strategies and discover that the regions-based pruning has certainstrengths that have not been exploited in the past. Motivated by this; we present a newregions-based pruning algorithm called Slice that utilizes the strength of regions-based …,The VLDB Journal,2017,1
A Novel and Fast SimRank Algorithm,Juan Lu; Zhiguo Gong; Xuemin Lin,SimRank is a widely adopted similarity measure for objects modeled as nodes in a graph;based on the intuition that two objects are similar if they are referenced by similar objects.The recursive nature of SimRank definition makes it expensive to compute the similarityscore even for a single pair of nodes. This defect limits the applications of SimRank. Tospeed up the computation; some existing works replace the original model with anapproximate model to seek only rough solution of SimRank scores. In this work; we proposea novel solution for computing all-pair SimRank scores. In particular; we propose to convertSimRank to the problem of solving a linear system in matrix form; and further prove that thesystem is non-singular; diagonally dominate; and symmetric definite positive (for undirectedgraphs). Those features immediately lead to the adoption of Conjugate Gradient (CG) and …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,1
Categorical top-k spatial influence query,Jianye Yang; Wenjie Zhang; Ying Zhang; Xiaoyang Wang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract The influence of a spatial facility object depicts the importance of the object in thewhole data space. In this paper; we present a novel definition of object influence inapplications where objects are of different categories. We study the problem of SpatialInfluence Query which considers the contribution of an object in forming functional unitsconsisting of a given set of objects with different categories designated by users. We firstshow that the problem of spatial influence query is NP-hard with respect to the number ofobject categories in the functional unit. To tackle the computational hardness; we develop anefficient framework following two main steps; possible participants finding and optimalfunctional unit computation. Based on this framework; for the first step; novel and efficientpruning techniques are developed based on the nearest neighbor set (NNS) approach …,World Wide Web,2017,1
Finding Critical Users for Social Network Engagement: The Collapsed k-Core Problem.,Fan Zhang; Ying Zhang; Lu Qin; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract In social networks; the leave of critical users may significantly break networkengagement; ie; lead a large number of other users to drop out. A popular model to measuresocial network engagement is k-core; the maximal induced subgraph in which every vertexhas at least k neighbors. To identify critical users for social network engagement; wepropose the collapsed k-core problem: given a graph G; a positive integer k and a budget b;we aim to find b vertices in G such that the deletion of the b vertices leads to the smallest k-core. We prove the problem is NP-hard. Then; an efficient algorithm is proposed; whichsignificantly reduces the number of candidate vertices to speed up the computation. Ourcomprehensive experiments on 9 real-life social networks demonstrate the effectivenessand efficiency of our proposed method.,AAAI,2017,1
OLAK: an efficient algorithm to prevent unraveling in social networks,Fan Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Ying Zhang; Lu Qin; Xuemin Lin,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of the anchored k-core. Given a graph G; aninteger k and a budget b; we aim to identify b vertices in G so that we can determine thelargest induced subgraph J in which every vertex; except the b vertices; has at least kneighbors in J. This problem was introduced by Bhawalkar and Kleinberg et al. in thecontext of user engagement in social networks; where a user may leave a community ifhe/she has less than k friends engaged. The problem has been shown to be NP-hard andinapproximable. A polynomial-time algorithm for graphs with bounded tree-width has beenproposed. However; this assumption usually does not hold in real-life graphs; and theirtechniques cannot be extended to handle general graphs.

Efficient Recovery of Missing Events,Jianmin Wang; Shaoxu Song; Xiaochen Zhu; Xuemin Lin; Jiaguang Sun,For various entering and transmission issues raised by human or system; missing eventsoften occur in event data; which record execution logs of business processes. Withoutrecovering the missing events; applications such as provenance analysis or complex eventprocessing built upon event data are not reliable. Following the minimum change disciplinein improving data quality; it is also rational to find a recovery that minimally differs from theoriginal data. Existing recovery approaches fall short of efficiency owing to enumerating andsearching over all of the possible sequences of events. In this paper; we study the efficienttechniques for recovering missing events. According to our theoretical results; the recoveryproblem appears to be NP-hard. Nevertheless; advanced indexing; pruning techniques aredeveloped to further improve the recovery efficiency. The experimental results …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,1
Efficient Identification of Local Keyword Patterns in Microblogging Platforms,Xiaoyang Wang; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Microblogging platforms; such as Twitter; serve as an important and efficient channel forsharing information. With the prevalence of geo-position enabled devices; a rapidly growingamount of microblogs are associated with geo-tags. Consequently; real-time analysis of thegeo-tagged microblog stream has attracted great attentions. In this paper; we advocate thesignificance of keyword co-occurrence for geo-tagged microblogs analysis; which has beenoverlooked by existing studies. The co-occurrence of keywords is necessary to resolve theambiguity in event analysis; especially when different events have overlapping descriptions.Given a geo-tagged microblog stream; we formally define the problem of identifying local(top-$ K $) maximal frequent keyword co-occurrence patterns over geo-tagged microblogstream; namely LFP (LKFP) query.

Scalable supergraph search in large graph databases,Bingqing Lyu; Lu Qin; Xuemin Lin; Lijun Chang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Supergraph search is a fundamental problem in graph databases that is widely applied inmany application scenarios. Given a graph database and a query-graph; supergraph searchretrieves all data-graphs contained in the query-graph from the graph database. Mostexisting solutions for supergraph search follow the pruning-and-verification framework;which prunes false answers based on features in the pruning phase and performs subgraphisomorphism testings on the remaining graphs in the verification phase. However; they arenot scalable to handle large-sized data-graphs and query-graphs due to three drawbacks.First; they rely on a frequent subgraph mining algorithm to select features which is expensiveand cannot generate large features. Second; they require a costly verification phase. Third;they process features in a fixed order without considering their relationship to the query …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,1
BEVA: An Efficient Query Processing Algorithm for Error-Tolerant Autocompletion,Xiaoling Zhou; Jianbin Qin; Chuan Xiao; Wei Wang; Xuemin Lin; Yoshiharu Ishikawa,Abstract Query autocompletion has become a standard feature in many search applications;especially for search engines. A recent trend is to support the error-tolerant autocompletion;which increases the usability significantly by matching prefixes of database strings andallowing a small number of errors. In this article; we systematically study the queryprocessing problem for error-tolerant autocompletion with a given edit distance threshold.We propose a general framework that encompasses existing methods and characterizesdifferent classes of algorithms and the minimum amount of information they need to maintainunder different constraints. We then propose a novel evaluation strategy that achieves theminimum active node size by eliminating ancestor-descendant relationships among activenodes entirely. In addition; we characterize the essence of edit distance computation by a …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2016,1
Range Search on Uncertain Trajectories,Liming Zhan; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xiaoyang Wang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract The range search on trajectories is fundamental in a wide spectrum of applicationssuch as environment monitoring and location based services. In practice; a large portion ofspatio-temporal data in the above applications is generated with low sampling rate and theuncertainty arises between two subsequent observations of a moving object. To make senseof the uncertain trajectory data; it is critical to properly model the uncertainty of thetrajectories and develop efficient range search algorithms on the new model. Assuminguncertain trajectories are modeled by the popular Markov Chains; in this paper weinvestigate the problem of range search on uncertain trajectories. In particular; we propose ageneral framework for range search on uncertain trajectories following the filtering-and-refinement paradigm where summaries of uncertain trajectories are constructed to …,Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2015,1
Selecting Representative Objects Considering Coverage and Diversity,Shenlu Wang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract We say that an object o attracts a user u if o is one of the top-k objects according tothe preference function defined by u. Given a set of objects (eg; restaurants) and a set ofusers; in this paper; we study the problem of computing a set of representative objectsconsidering two criteria: coverage and diversity. Coverage of a set S of objects is the distinctnumber of users that are attracted by the objects in S. Although a set of objects with highcoverage attracts a large number of users; it is possible that all of these users have quitesimilar preferences. Consequently; the set of objects may be attractive only for a specificclass of users with similar preference functions which may disappoint other users havingwidely different preferences. The diversity criterion addresses this issue by selecting a set Sof objects such that the set of attracted users for each object in S is as different as …,Second International ACM Workshop on Managing and Mining Enriched Geo-Spatial Data,2015,1
Optimal Spatial Dominance: An Effective Search of Nearest Neighbor Candidates,Xiaoyang Wang; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Muhammad Aamir Cheema,Abstract In many domains such as computational geometry and database management; anobject may be described by multiple instances (points). Then the distance (or similarity)between two objects is captured by the pair-wise distances among their instances. In thepast; numerous nearest neighbor (NN) functions have been proposed to define the distancebetween objects with multiple instances and to identify the NN object. Nevertheless;considering that a user may not have a specific NN function in mind; it is desirable to provideher with a set of NN candidates. Ideally; the set of NN candidates must include every objectthat is NN for at least one of the NN functions and must exclude every non-promising object.However; no one has studied the problem of NN candidates computation from thisperspective. Although some of the existing works aim at returning a set of candidate …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,1
CTrace: semantic comparison of multi-granularity process traces,Qing Liu; Kerry Taylor; Xiang Zhao; Geoffrey Squire; Xuemin Lin; Corne Kloppers; Richard Miller,Abstract A process trace describes the processes taken in a workflow to generate aparticular result. Given many process traces; each with a large amount of very low levelinformation; it is a challenge to make process traces meaningful to different users. It is morechallenging to compare two complex process traces generated by heterogenous systemsand have different levels of granularity. We present CTrace; a system that (1) lets usersexplore the conceptual abstraction of large process traces with different levels of granularity;and (2) provides semantic comparison among traces in which both the structural and thesemantic similarity are considered. The above functions are underpinned by a novel notionof multi-granularity process trace and efficient multi-granularity similarity comparisonalgorithms.,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,1
Efficient subgraph similarity all-matching,Gaoping Zhu; Ke Zhu; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Chuan Xiao,Abstract Being a fundamental problem in managing graph data; subgraph exact all-matching enumerates all isomorphic matches of a query graph q in a large data graph G.The existing techniques focus on pruning non-promising data graph vertices against q.However; the reduction and sharing of intermediate matches have not received adequateattention. These two issues become more critical on subgraph similarity all-matching due tothe (possibly) massive number of intermediate matches. This paper studies the problem ofefficient subgraph similarity all-matching by developing a novel query processingframework. We propose to effectively decompose a query graph into a hierarchical structurewith the aim to minimize the number of intermediate matches and share intermediatematches. Novel techniques are then developed to estimate the number of intermediate …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2012,1
A unified algorithm for continuous monitoring of spatial queries,Mahady Hasan; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang,Abstract Continuous monitoring of spatial queries has gained significant research attentionin the past few years. Although numerous algorithms have been proposed to solve specificqueries; there does not exist a unified algorithm that solves a broad class of spatial queries.In this paper; we first define a versatile top-k query and show that various important spatialqueries can be modeled to a versatile top-k query by defining a suitable scoring function.Then; we propose an efficient algorithm to continuously monitor the versatile top-k queries.To show the effectiveness of our proposed approach; we model various inherently differentspatial queries to the versatile top-k query and conduct experiments to show the efficiency ofour unified algorithm. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our unifiedalgorithm is several times faster than the existing best known algorithms for monitoring …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2011,1

Continually answering constraint k-NN queries in unstructured P2P systems,Bin Wang; Xiao-Chun Yang; Guo-Ren Wang; Ge Yu; Lei Chen; X Sean Wang; Xue-Min Lin,Abstract We consider the problem of efficiently computing distributed geographical k-NNqueries in an unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) system; in which each peer is managed by anindividual organization and can only communicate with its logical neighboring peers. Suchqueries are based on local filter query statistics; and require as less communication cost aspossible; which makes it more difficult than the existing distributed k-NN queries. Especially;we hope to reduce candidate peers and degrade communication cost. In this paper; wepropose an efficient pruning technique to minimize the number of candidate peers to beprocessed to answer the k-NN queries. Our approach is especially suitable for continuous k-NN queries when updating peers; including changing ranges of peers; dynamically leavingor joining peers; and updating data in a peer. In addition; simulation results show that the …,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2008,1

Error minimization in approximate range aggregates,Xuemin Lin; Qing Zhang; Yidong Yuan; Qing Liu,Abstract Histogram techniques have been used in many commercial database managementsystems to estimate a query result size. Recently; it has been shown that they are veryeffective to support approximation of query processing especially aggregates. In this paper;we investigate the problem of minimizing average errors of approximate aggregates usinghistogram techniques. Firstly; we present a novel linear-spline histogram model that is moreaccurate than the existing models. Secondly; we propose a novel histogram constructiontechnique for minimizing such average errors; which is shown to generate a near optimalhistogram. Our experiment results demonstrate that the new histogram constructiontechniques lead to a great accuracy improvement on the existing techniques.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2007,1
A multiresolution terrain model for efficient visualization query processing,Kai Xu; Xiaofang Zhou; Xuemin Lin; Heng Tao Shen; Ke Deng,Multiresolution triangular mesh (MTM) models are widely used to improve the performanceof large terrain visualization by replacing the original model with a simplified one. MTMmodels; which consist of both original and simplified data; are commonly stored in spatialdatabase systems due to their size. The relatively slow access speed of disks makes dataretrieval the bottleneck of such terrain visualization systems. Existing spatial access methodsproposed to address this problem rely on main-memory MTM models; which leads tosignificant overhead during query processing. In this paper; we approach the problem from anew perspective and propose a novel MTM called direct mesh that is designed specificallyfor secondary storage. It supports available indexing methods natively and requires nomodification to MTM structure.

In this paper; we examine the selectivity estimation forrange window query to summarize the four important topological relations: contains;contained; overlap; and disjoint. We propose a novel hybrid histogram method which usesthe concept of Min-skew partition in conjunction with Euler histogram approach. It caneffectively model object spatial distribution. Our extensive experiments against bothsynthetic and real world datasets demonstrated that our hybrid histogram techniquesimprove the accuracy of the existing techniques by about one order of magnitude whileretaining the cost efficiency.,Web Technologies Research and Development-APWeb 2005,2005,1
Spatial query processing using generalized filter,Xiaofang Zhou; Xuemin Lin; Chengfei Liu; Jinli Cao,Spatial data; ranging from various land information data to different types of environmentaldata; are typically collected and used by different custodians. The full benefits of usingspatial data can be achieved by combining the data from different sources covering acommon region. Due to organizational; political and technical reasons; it is unrealistic tophysically integrate the vast amount of spatial data managed by different systems in differentorganizations. A practical approach is to provide interoperability to support multi-site dataqueries. In this paper; we study the performance aspect of complex spatial query processing.We propose a framework for processing queries with multiple spatial and aspatial predicatesusing data from multiple sites. Using a new concept called generalized filter; a query isprocessed in three steps. First; an aspatial filter that incorporates some conditions derived …,International Journal of Cooperative Information Systems,2000,1

A highly fault-tolerant quorum consensus method for managing replicated data,Xuemin Lin; Maria E Orlowska,Abstract The main objective of data replication is to provide high availability of data forprocessing transactions. Quorum consensus (QC) methods are frequently applied tomanaging replicated data. In this paper; we present a new QC method. The proposed QCapproach has a low message overhead: 1) In the best case; each transaction operationprocess needs only to communicate with O\left (\sqrt n\log^ 1-1 2\log _ 3^ 2 n\right)\left (≈O\left (\sqrt n\log^ 0.208 n\right)\right) remote sites (n is the number of sites storing themanipulating data item). 2) In the worst case; each transaction operation process may beforced to communicate with O\left (\sqrt n\log^ 1 2\log _ 3^ 2 n\right)\left (≈ O\left (\sqrt n\log^0.792 n\right)\right) remote sites. Further; we can show that the proposed QC method ishighly fault-tolerant. The proposed approach is also fully distributed; that is; each site in a …,International Computing and Combinatorics Conference,1995,1
An Optimal and Progressive Approach to Online Search of Top-k Important Communities,Fei Bi; Lijun Chang; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang,Abstract: Community search over large graphs is a fundamental problem in graph analysis.Recent studies also propose to compute top-k important communities; where each reportedcommunity not only is a cohesive subgraph but also has a high importance value. Theexisting approaches to the problem of importance-based top-k community search are eitherindex-based algorithms or online search algorithms without indexes. As the index-basedalgorithms need to pre-compute a special-purpose index and can only work for one built-invertex weight vector; in this paper we study the online search approach. Considering thelimitation of the existing online search algorithms that need to traverse the entire graph; inthis paper we propose an optimal online search algorithm LocalSearch whose timecomplexity is linearly proportional to the size of the smallest subgraph that a correct …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.05857,2017,*
Dynamical SimRank search on time-varying networks,Weiren Yu; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Julie A McCann,Abstract SimRank is an appealing pair-wise similarity measure based on graph structure. Ititeratively follows the intuition that two nodes are assessed as similar if they are pointed toby similar nodes. Many real graphs are large; and links are constantly subject to minorchanges. In this article; we study the efficient dynamical computation of all-pairs SimRankson time-varying graphs. Existing methods for the dynamical SimRank computation eg; LTSF(Shao et al. in PVLDB 8 (8): 838–849; 2015) and READS (Zhang et al. in PVLDB 10 (5): 601–612; 2017) mainly focus on top-k search with respect to a given query. For all-pairsdynamical SimRank search; Li et al.'s approach (Li et al. in EDBT; 2010) was proposed forthis problem.

DSKQ: A System for Efficient Processing of Diversified Spatial-Keyword Query,Shanqing Jiang; Chengyuan Zhang; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xiaoyang Wang,Abstract With the rapid development of mobile portable devices and location positioningtechnologies; massive amount of geo-textual data are being generated by a huge number ofweb users on various social platforms; such as Facebook and Twitter. Meanwhile; spatial-textual objects that represent Point-of-interests (POIs; eg; shops; cinema; hotel or restaurant)are increasing pervasively. Consequently; how to retrieve a set of objects that best matchesthe user's submitted spatial keyword query (SKQ) has been intensively studied by theresearch communities and commercial organisations.

Efficient Graph Edit Distance Computation and Verification via Anchor-aware Lower Bound Estimation,Lijun Chang; Xing Feng; Xuemin Lin; Lu Qin; Wenjie Zhang,Abstract: Graph edit distance (GED) is an important similarity measure adopted in a similarity-based analysis between two graphs; and computing GED is a primitive operator in graphdatabase analysis. Partially due to the NP-hardness; the existing techniques for computingGED are only able to process very small graphs with less than 30 vertices. Motivated by this;in this paper we systematically study the problems of both GED computation; and GEDverification (ie; verify whether the GED between two graphs is no larger than a user-giventhreshold). Firstly; we develop a unified framework that can be instantiated into either a best-first search approach AStar+ or a depth-first search approach DFS+. Secondly; we designanchor-aware lower bound estimation techniques to compute tighter lower bounds forintermediate search states; which significantly reduce the search spaces of both AStar+ …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.06810,2017,*

Efficient Matrix Sketching over Distributed Data,Zengfeng Huang; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Ying Zhang,Abstract A sketch or synopsis of a large dataset captures vital properties of the original datawhile typically occupying much less space. In this paper; we consider the problem ofcomputing a sketch of a massive data matrix A∈ ℜ nxd; which is distributed across a largenumber of s servers. Our goal is to output a matrix B∈ ℜ ℓ xd which is significantly smallerthan but still approximates A well in terms of covariance error; ie;|| AT AB TB|| 2||. Here; for amatrix A;|| A|| 2|| is the spectral norm of A; which is defined as the largest singular value of A.Following previous works; we call B a covariance sketch of A. We are mainly focused onminimizing the communication cost; which is arguably the most valuable resource indistributed computations. We show a gap between deterministic and randomizedcommunication complexity for computing a covariance sketch.

TT-Join: Efficient Set Containment Join,Jianye Yang; Wenjie Zhang; Shiyu Yang; Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin,In this paper; we study the problem of set containment join. Given two collections R and S ofrecords; the set containment join R./S retrieves all record pairs f (r; s) g 2 RS such that r s.This problem has been extensively studied in the literature and has many importantapplications in commercial and scientific fields. Recent research focuses on the in-memoryset containment join algorithms; and several techniques have been developed followingintersectionoriented or union-oriented computing paradigms. Nevertheless; we observe thattwo computing paradigms have their limits due to the nature of the intersection and unionoperators. Particularly; intersection-oriented method relies on the intersection of the relevantinverted lists built on the elements of S. A nice property of the intersection-oriented method isthat the join computation is verification free.

Tracking Matrix Approximation over Distributed Sliding Windows,Haida Zhang; Zengfeng Huang; Zhewei Wei; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin,In many modern applications; input data is represented as matrices and often arrivescontinuously. The ability to summarize and approximate data matrices in streaming fashionhas become a common requirement in many emerging environments. In these applications;input data is usually generated at multiple distributed sites and simply centralizing all data isoften infeasible. Therefore; novel algorithmic techniques are required. Furthermore; in mostof these applications; queries must be answered solely based on the recently observed datapoints (eg; data collected over the last hour/day/month); which makes the problem evenmore challenging. In this paper; we propose to study the problem of tracking matrixapproximations over distributed sliding windows.

Enumerating k-Vertex Connected Components in Large Graphs,Dong Wen; Lu Qin; Xuemin Lin; Ying Zhang; Lijun Chang,Abstract: Cohesive subgraph detection is an important graph problem that is widely appliedin many application domains; such as social community detection; network visualization;and network topology analysis. Most of existing cohesive subgraph metrics can guaranteegood structural properties but may cause the free-rider effect. Here; by free-rider effect; wemean that some irrelevant subgraphs are combined as one subgraph if they only share asmall number of vertices and edges. In this paper; we study k-vertex connected component(k-VCC) which can effectively eliminate the free-rider effect but less studied in the literature.A k-VCC is a connected subgraph in which the removal of any k-1 vertices will notdisconnect the subgraph. In addition to eliminating the free-rider effect; k-VCC also has otheradvantages such as bounded diameter; high cohesiveness; bounded graph overlapping …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.08668,2017,*
Efficient structure similarity searches: a partition-based approach,Xiang Zhao; Chuan Xiao; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Yang Wang,Abstract Graphs are widely used to model complex data in many applications; such asbioinformatics; chemistry; social networks; pattern recognition. A fundamental and criticalquery primitive is to efficiently search similar structures in a large collection of graphs. Thisarticle mainly studies threshold-based graph similarity search with edit distance constraints.Existing solutions to the problem utilize fixed-size overlapping substructures to generatecandidates; and thus become susceptible to large vertex degrees and distance thresholds.In this article; we present a partition-based approach to tackle the problem. By dividing datagraphs into variable-size non-overlapping partitions; the edit distance constraint is convertedto a graph containment constraint for candidate generation.

Effective and Efficient Dynamic Graph Coloring,Long Yuan; Lu Qin; Xuemin Lin; Lijun Chang; Wenjie Zhang,ABSTRACT Graph coloring is a fundamental graph problem that is widely applied in avariety of applications. The aim of graph coloring is to minimize the number of colors used tocolor the vertices in a graph such that no two incident vertices have the same color. Existingsolutions for graph coloring mainly focus on computing a good coloring for a static graph.However; since many real-world graphs are highly dynamic; in this paper; we aim toincrementally maintain the graph coloring when the graph is dynamically updated. We targeton two goals: high effectiveness and high efficiency. To achieve high effectiveness; wemaintain the graph coloring in a way such that the coloring result is consistent with one ofthe best static graph coloring algorithms for large graphs.

Efficient Structural Graph Clustering: An Index-Based Approach,Dong Wen; Lu Qin; Ying Zhang; Lijun Chang; Xuemin Lin,ABSTRACT Graph clustering is a fundamental problem widely experienced across manyindustries. The structural graph clustering (SCAN) method obtains not only clusters but alsohubs and outliers. However; the clustering results closely depend on two sensitiveparameters; ϵ and µ; while the optimal parameter setting depends on different graphproperties and various user requirements. Moreover; all existing SCAN solutions need toscan at least the whole graph; even if only a small number of vertices belong to clusters. Inthis paper we propose an index-based method for SCAN.

Influence based cost optimization on user preference,Jianye Yang; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin,The popularity of e-business and preference learning techniques have contributed a hugeamount of product and user preference data. Analyzing the influence of an existing or newproduct among the users is critical to unlock the great scientific and social-economic value ofthese data. In this paper; we advocate the problem of influence-based cost optimization forthe user preference and product data; which is fundamental in many real applications suchas marketing and advertising. Generally; we aim to find a cost optimal position for a newproduct such that it can attract at least k or a particular percentage of users for the given userpreference functions and competitors' products. Although we show the solution space of ourproblem can be reduced to a finite number of possible positions (points) by utilizing theclassical k-level computation techniques; the computation cost is still very expensive due …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,*

Impact Set: Computing Influence Using Query Logs,Shiyu Yang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin,Abstract A facility is said to influence a user if is one of the closest facilities of the user. This isbecause users usually prefer to visit/use nearby facilities. The influence set of a facility is theset of users influenced by. The computation of the influence set has gained extensiveresearch attention in the past decade. Note that the definition of influence set assumes thateach user behaves the same; ie each user prefers the closest facilities where is a constant.However; in real-world scenarios; different users may prefer different values of dependingon; for example; the density of facilities around them; the mode of transport available to themetc. Therefore; assuming a constant value of for each user may not be able to capture theessence of influence effectively. In this paper; we compute the influence of a facility using thequery logs that contain the-nearest neighbors queries issued in the past and essentially …,The Computer Journal,2015,*

Efficient String Similarity Search: A Cross Pivotal Based Approach,Fei Bi; Lijun Chang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of string similarity search with edit distanceconstraint; it retrieves all strings in a string database that are similar to a query string. Thestate-of-the-art approaches employ the concept of pivotal set; which is a set of non-overlapping signatures; for indexing and query processing. However; they do not fullyexploit the pruning power potential of the pivotal sets by using only the pivotal set of thequery string or the data strings. To remedy this issue; in this paper we propose a crosspivotal based approach to fully exploiting the pruning power of multiple pivotal sets. Weprove theoretically that our cross pivotal filter has stronger pruning power than state-of-the-art filters. We also propose a more efficient algorithm with better time complexity for pivotalselection. Moreover; we further develop two advanced filters to prune unpromising single …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2015,*
Efficiently Retrieving Top-k Trajectories by Locations via Traveling Time,Yuxing Han; Lijun Chang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Liping Wang,Abstract The flourishing industry of location-based services has collected a massive amountof users' positions in the form of spatial trajectories; which raise many research problems. Inthis paper; we study a trajectory retrieving query; k-TLT; which aims at retrieving the top-kTrajectories by Locations and ranked by traveling Time. Given a set Q of query locations; ak-TLT query retrieves top-k trajectories that are close to Q with respect to traveling time. Incontrast to existing works which consider only location information; k-TLT queries alsoconsider the traveling time information; which have many applications; such as travel routeplanning and moving object study. To efficiently answer ak-TLT query; we first onlinecompute a list L q of trajectories for each query location q∈ Q; such that trajectories in L qare ranked by their traveling time to q. Based on the online generated lists L q …,Australasian Database Conference,2014,*
On Efficient Graph Substructure Selection,Xiang Zhao; Haichuan Shang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Weidong Xiao,Abstract Graphs have a wide range of applications in many domains. The graphsubstructure selection problem is to find all subgraph isomorphic mappings of a query frommulti-attributed graphs; such that each pair of matching vertices satisfy a set of selectionconditions; each against an equality; range; or set containment operator on a vertexattribute. Existing techniques for single-labeled graphs are developed under the assumptionof identical label matching; and thus; cannot handle the general case in substructureselections. To this end; this paper proposes a two-tier index to support general selections viajudiciously materializing certain mappings. Moreover; we propose efficient dynamic queryprocessing and index construction algorithms. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate theeffectiveness and efficiency of our approach.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2013,*
AVR-Tree: Speeding Up the NN and ANN Queries on Location Data,Qianlu Lin; Ying Zhang; Wenjie Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract In the paper; we study the problems of nearest neighbor queries (NN) and allnearest neighbor queries (ANN) on location data; which have a wide range of applicationssuch as Geographic Information System (GIS) and Location based Service (LBS). Wepropose a new structure; termed AVR-Tree; based on the R-tree and Voronoi diagramtechniques. Compared with the existing indexing techniques used for NN and ANN querieson location data; AVR-Tree can achieve a better trade-off between the pruning effectivenessand the index size for NN and ANN queries. We also conduct a comprehensive performanceevaluation for the proposed techniques based on both real and synthetic data; which showsthat AVR-Tree based NN and ANN algorithms achieve better performance compared withtheir best competitors in terms of both CPU and I/O costs.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2013,*
Skyline: Stacking Optimal Solutions in Exact and Uncertain Worlds.,Wenjie Zhang; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin,Abstract In many applications involving multiple criteria optimal decision making; users mayoften want to make a personal trade-off among all optimal solutions for selecting one objectthat best fits their personal needs. As a key feature; skyline in a multi-dimensional spaceprovides a minimal set of candidates for such purposes by removing every object that is notpreferred by any (monotonic) utility/scoring function; that is; the skyline removes all objectsnot preferred by any user no matter how their preferences vary. Due to its importance; theproblem of skyline computation and its variants have been extensively studied in thedatabase literature. In this paper; we provide a comprehensive survey of skylinecomputation techniques. Specifically; we first introduce the skyline computation algorithmson traditional (exact) data where each object corresponds to a point in a multi …,Int. J. Software and Informatics,2012,*
Influence Zone and Its Applications in Reverse k Nearest Neighbors Processing,NEW SOUTH WALES,Abstract Given a set of objects and a query q; a point p is called the reverse k nearestneighbor (RkNN) of q if q is one of the k closest objects of p. In this paper; we introduce theconcept of influence zone which is the area such that every point inside this area is theRkNN of q and every point outside this area is not the RkNN. The influence zone has severalapplications in location based services; marketing and decision support systems. It can alsobe used to efficiently process RkNN queries. First; we present efficient algorithm to computethe influence zone. Then; based on the influence zone; we present efficient algorithms toprocess RkNN queries that significantly outperform existing best known techniques for boththe snapshot and continuous RkNN queries. We also present a detailed theoretical analysisto analyse the area of the influence zone and IO costs of our RkNN processing algorithms …,*,2010,*
Efficiently computing weighted proximity relationships in spatial databases,Xuemin Lin; Xiaomei Zhou; Chengfei Liu; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Spatial data mining recently emerges from a number of real applications; such asreal-estate marketing; urban planning; weather forecasting; medical image analysis; roadtraffic accident analysis; etc. It demands for efficient solutions for many new; expensive; andcomplicated problems. In this paper; we investigate the problem of evaluating the top kdistinguished “features” for a “cluster” based on weighted proximity relationships betweenthe cluster and features. We measure proximity in an average fashion to address possiblenonuniform data distribution in a cluster. Combining a standard multi-step paradigm withnew lower and upper proximity bounds; we presented an efficient algorithm to solve theproblem. The algorithm is implemented in several different modes. Our experiment resultsnot only give a comparison among them but also illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2001,*

Confirmation: a solution for non-compensatability in workflow applications,Chengfei Liu; Maria Orlowska; Xiaofang Zhou; Xuemin Lin,The notion of a compensation is widely used in advanced transaction models as means ofrecovery from a failure. Similar concepts are adopted for providing" transaction-like"behaviour for long business processes supported by workflows technology. Generally;designing a compensating task in the context of a workflow process is a non-trivial job. Infact; not every task is compensatable. This work contributes to the study of the non-compensatability problem. A compensating task C of a task T semantically undoes the effectof T after T has been committed. For example; the compensating task of a deposit is awithdrawal. For a task to be compensatable; it must satisfy two conditions. Forcibility: Thecompensating task of the task must be forcible. In other words; after the task commits; theexecution of its compensating task is guaranteed to succeed by the application semantics …,Data Engineering; 1999.

Clustering Classes Through Graph Transformation,Jian Chen; Xuemin Lin,Abstract Object orientation provides great potentials for achieve high level modularity andreusability in software development. A well-known notion called the wellformedness of classhierarchies provides useful properties such as localising type checking and safe code reuse.However this notion cannot be e ectively applied to many existing languages such as Ei eland C++ as it restricts some programming constructs widely used in current practice. Thework described in this paper generalises the well-formedness of class hierarchy to the well-formedness of cluster hierarchy. A cluster can be seen as a set of closely related classes in aclass hierarchy. Clusters; instead of classes; are regarded as the basic units in achievingindependent type checking and safe code reuse in our approach. This allows us to applyuseful properties similar to those of well-formed class hierarchies to languages where …,*,1995,*

A NEW GRAPHICAL METHOD FOR WERTICAL PARTITIONING IN DATABASE DESIGN,Xuemin Lin,ABSTRACT In this paper; a graphical approach to vertical partitioning of a relation ispresented. An attribute affinity graph expressed by an affinity matrix can be easilyconstructed from the set of important and frequently used transactions to the system. This isthe input of our partitioning process. The partitioning process has two major steps. In the firstphase; a set of clusters on the affinity graph is constructed; where each cluster is a vertex setof a subgraph with a" strong" connectivity between vertices. In the second phase; clusterswith the" highest affinity index" are iteratively chosen as fragments. This approachovercomes most of the deficiencies of the partitioning algorithm by Navathe-Ra [Nava 89].The overall computational complexity of this proposed approach is usu-ally smaller than thealgorithm [Nava 84].,Advances In Database Research-Proceedings Of The 4th Australian Database Conference,1993,*

A Partition-Based Approach to Web Hyperlink Analysis,Weiren Yu; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Julie A McCann,Abstract SimRank is an attractive pair-wise similarity measure based on graph structure. Ititeratively follows the intuition that two nodes are assessed as similar if they are referencedby similar nodes. Real networks are often large; and links are constantly subject to minorchanges. In this article; we focus on efficient dynamical computation of SimRanks on time-varying graphs. The prior approach to this problem factorizes the network via a singularvalue decomposition (SVD) first; and then incrementally maintains such a factorization inresponse to link updates at the expense of exactness. As a result; all pairs of SimRanks areupdated approximately; yielding O (r4n2) time and O (r2n2) memory in a graph with n nodes;where r is the target rank of the low-rank SVD; but r is not negligibly small in practice. Oursolution to dynamical computation of SimRank comprises of five ingredients:(1) We first …,*,*,*
