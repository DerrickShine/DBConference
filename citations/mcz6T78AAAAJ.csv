Efficient filtering of XML documents with XPath expressions,C-Y Chan; Pascal Felber; Minos Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract The publish/subscribe paradigm is a popular model for allowing publishers (ie; datagenerators) to selectively disseminate data to a large number of widely dispersedsubscribers (ie; data consumers) who have registered their interest in specific informationitems. Early publish/subscribe systems have typically relied on simple subscriptionmechanisms; such as keyword or” bag of words” matching; or simple comparison predicateson attribute values. The emergence of XML as a standard for information exchange on theInternet has led to an increased interest in using more expressive subscription mechanisms(eg; based on XPath expressions) that exploit both the structure and the content of publishedXML documents. Given the increased complexity of these new data-filtering mechanisms;the problem of effectively identifying the subscription profiles that match an incoming XML …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2002,565
Bitmap index design and evaluation,Chee-Yong Chan; Yannis E Ioannidis,Abstract Bitmap indexing has been touted as a promising approach for processing complexadhoc queries in read-mostly environments; like those of decision support systems.Nevertheless; only few possible bitmap schemes have been proposed in the past and verylittle is known about the space-time tradeoff that they offer. In this paper; we present ageneral framework to study the design space of bitmap indexes for selection queries andexamine the disk-space and time characteristics that the various alternative index choicesoffer. In particular; we draw a parallel between bitmap indexing and number representationin different number systems; and define a space of two orthogonal dimensions that capturesa wide array of bitmap indexes; both old and new. Within that space; we identify (analyticallyor experimentally) the following interesting points:(1) the time-optimal bitmap index;(2) the …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1998,483
Finding k-dominant skylines in high dimensional space,Chee-Yong Chan; HV Jagadish; Kian-Lee Tan; Anthony KH Tung; Zhenjie Zhang,Abstract Given a d-dimensional data set; a point p dominates another point q if it is betterthan or equal to q in all dimensions and better than q in at least one dimension. A point is askyline point if there does not exists any point that can dominate it. Skyline queries; whichreturn skyline points; are useful in many decision making applications. Unfortunately; as thenumber of dimensions increases; the chance of one point dominating another point is verylow. As such; the number of skyline points become too numerous to offer any interestinginsights. To find more important and meaningful skyline points in high dimensional space;we propose a new concept; called k-dominant skyline which relaxes the idea of dominanceto k-dominance. A point p is said to k-dominate another point q if there are k≤ d dimensionsin which p is better than or equal to q and is better in at least one of these k dimensions.

From region encoding to extended dewey: On efficient processing of XML twig pattern matching,Jiaheng Lu; Tok Wang Ling; Chee-Yong Chan; Ting Chen,Abstract Finding all the occurrences of a twig pattern in an XML database is a core operationfor efficient evaluation of XML queries. A number of algorithms have been proposed toprocess a twig query based on region encoding labeling scheme. While region encodingsupports efficient determination of structural relationship between two elements; we observethat the information within a single label is very limited. In this paper; we propose a newlabeling scheme; called extended Dewey. This is a powerful labeling scheme; since from thelabel of an element alone; we can derive all the elements names along the path from theroot to the element. Based on extended Dewey; we design a novel holistic twig joinalgorithm; called TJFast. Unlike all previous algorithms based on region encoding; toanswer a twig query; TJFast only needs to access the labels of the leaf query nodes …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,379
Secure XML querying with security views,Wenfei Fan; Chee-Yong Chan; Minos Garofalakis,Abstract The prevalent use of XML highlights the need for a generic; flexible access-controlmechanism for XML documents that supports efficient and secure query access; withoutrevealing sensitive information unauthorized users. This paper introduces a novel paradigmfor specifying XML security constraints and investigates the enforcement of such constraintsduring XML query evaluation. Our approach is based on the novel concept of security views;which provide for each user group (a) an XML view consisting of all and only the informationthat the users are authorized to access; and (b) a view DTD that the XML view conforms to.Security views effectively protect sensitive data from access and potential inferences byunauthorized user; and provide authorized users with necessary schema information tofacilitate effective query formulation and optimization.

On high dimensional skylines,Chee-Yong Chan; HV Jagadish; Kian-Lee Tan; Anthony KH Tung; Zhenjie Zhang,Abstract In many decision-making applications; the skyline query is frequently used to find aset of dominating data points (called skyline points) in a multi-dimensional dataset. In a high-dimensional space skyline points no longer offer any interesting insights as there are toomany of them. In this paper; we introduce a novel metric; called skyline frequency thatcompares and ranks the interestingness of data points based on how often they are returnedin the skyline when different number of dimensions (ie; subspaces) are considered.Intuitively; a point with a high skyline frequency is more interesting as it can be dominated onfewer combinations of the dimensions. Thus; the problem becomes one of finding top-kfrequent skyline points. But the algorithms thus far proposed for skyline computation typicallydo not scale well with dimensionality. Moreover; frequent skyline computation requires …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,261
Multiway slca-based keyword search in xml data,Chong Sun; Chee-Yong Chan; Amit K Goenka,Abstract Keyword search for smallest lowest common ancestors (SLCAs) in XML data hasrecently been proposed as a meaningful way to identify interesting data nodes inXML datawhere their subtrees contain an input set of keywords. In this paper; we generalize thisuseful search paradigm to support keyword search beyond the traditional AND semantics toinclude both AND and OR boolean operators as well. We first analyze properties of the LCAcomputation and propose improved algorithms to solve the traditional keyword searchproblem (with only AND semantics). We then extend our approach to handle generalkeyword search involving combinations of AND and OR boolean operators. Theeffectiveness of our new algorithms is demonstrated with a comprehensive experimentalperformance study.,Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web,2007,243
An efficient bitmap encoding scheme for selection queries,Chee-Yong Chan; Yannis E Ioannidis,Abstract Bitmap indexes are useful in processing complex queries in decision supportsystems; and they have been implemented in several commercial database systems. A keydesign parameter for bitmap indexes is the encoding scheme; which determines the bits thatare set to 1 in each bitmap in an index. While the relative performance of the two existingbitmap encoding schemes for simple selection queries of the form “v 1≤ A≤ v 2” is known(specifically; one of the encoding schemes is better for processing equality queries; ie; v 1= v2; while the other is better for processing range queries; ie; v 1< v 2); it remains an openquestion whether these two encoding schemes are indeed optimal for their respective queryclasses in the sense that there is no other encoding scheme with better space-time tradeoff.In this paper; we establish a number of optimality results for the existing encoding …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1999,243
System and method for filtering XML documents with XPath expressions,*,A system for; and method of; filtering an XML document with XPath expressions and aselective data dissemination system incorporating the system or the method.

Stratified computation of skylines with partially-ordered domains,Chee-Yong Chan; Pin-Kwang Eng; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract In this paper; we study the evaluation of skyline queries with partially-orderedattributes. Because such attributes lack a total ordering; traditional index-based evaluationalgorithms (eg; NN and BBS) that are designed for totally-ordered attributes can no longerprune the space as effectively. Our solution is to transform each partially-ordered attributeinto a two-integer domain that allows us to exploit index-based algorithms to computeskyline queries on the transformed space. Based on this framework; we propose three novelalgorithms: BBS+ is a straightforward adaptation of BBS using the framework; and SDC(Stratification by Dominance Classification) and SDC+ are optimized to handle falsepositives and support progressive evaluation. Both SDC and SDC+ exploit a dominancerelationship to organize the data into strata. While SDC generates its strata at run time …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,192
Efficiently monitoring bandwidth and latency in IP networks,Yuri Breitbart; Chee-Yong Chan; Minos Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi; Abraham Silberschatz,Effective monitoring of network utilization and performance indicators is a key enablingtechnology for proactive and reactive resource management; flexible accounting; andintelligent planning in next-generation IP networks. In this paper; we address thechallenging problem of efficiently monitoring bandwidth utilization and path latencies in anIP data network. Unlike earlier approaches; our measurement architecture assumes a singlepoint-of-control in the network (corresponding to the network operations center) that isresponsible for gathering bandwidth and latency information using widely-deployedmanagement tools; like SNMP; RMON/NetFlow; and explicitly-routed IP probe packets. Ourgoal is to identify effective techniques for monitoring (a) bandwidth usage for a given set oflinks or packet flows; and (b) path latencies for a given set of paths; while minimizing the …,INFOCOM 2001.

How to ConQueR why-not questions,Quoc Trung Tran; Chee-Yong Chan,Abstract One useful feature that is missing from today's database systems is an explaincapability that enables users to seek clarifications on unexpected query results. There aretwo types of unexpected query results that are of interest: the presence of unexpected tuples;and the absence of expected tuples (ie; missing tuples). Clearly; it would be very helpful tousers if they could pose follow-up why and why-not questions to seek clarifications on;respectively; unexpected and expected (but missing) tuples in query results. While the whyquestions can be addressed by applying established data provenance techniques; theproblem of explaining the why-not questions has received very little attention. There arecurrently two explanation models proposed for why-not questions. The first model explains amissing tuple t in terms of modifications to the database such that t appears in the query …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,116
Finch: Evaluating reverse k-nearest-neighbor queries on location data,Wei Wu; Fei Yang; Chee-Yong Chan; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract A Reverse k-Nearest-Neighbor (RkNN) query finds the objects that take the queryobject as one of their k nearest neighbors. In this paper we propose new solutions forevaluating RkNN queries and its variant bichromatic RkNN queries on 2-dimensionallocation data. We present an algorithm named INCH that can compute a RkNN query'ssearch region (from which the query result candidates are drawn). In our RkNN evaluationalgorithm called FINCH; the search region restricts the search space; and the search regionis tightened each time a new result candidate is found. We also propose a method thatenables us to apply any RkNN algorithm on bichromatic RkNN queries. With that; our FINCHalgorithm is also used to evaluate bichromatic RkNN queries. Experiments show that oursolutions are more efficient than existing algorithms.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,114
Query by output,Quoc Trung Tran; Chee-Yong Chan; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract It has recently been asserted that the usability of a database is as important as itscapability. Understanding the database schema; the hidden relationships among attributesin the data all play an important role in this context. Subscribing to this viewpoint; in thispaper; we present a novel data-driven approach; called Query By Output (QBO); which canenhance the usability of database systems. The central goal of QBO is as follows: given theoutput of some query Q on a database D; denoted by Q (D); we wish to construct analternative query Q′ such that Q (D) and Q′(D) are instance-equivalent. To generateinstance-equivalent queries from Q (D); we devise a novel data classification-basedtechnique that can handle the at-least-one semantics that is inherent in the query derivation.In addition to the basic framework; we design several optimization techniques to reduce …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,103
Hierarchical cubes for range-sum queries,Chee Yong Chan; Yannis E Ioannidis,Abstract A range-sum query sums over all selected cells of an OLAP data cube where theselection is specified by ranges of contiguous values for each dimension. An efficientapproach to process such queries is to precompute a prefix cube (PC); which is a cube ofthe same dimensionality and size as the original data cube but with a prefix range-sumstored in each cell. Using a PC; any range-sum query can be evaluated at a cost that isindependent of the size of the sub-cube circumscribed by the query. However; a drawback ofPCs is that they are very costly to maintain. Recently; a variant of prefix cubes calledRelative Prefix Cubes (RPC) has been proposed to alleviate this problem. In this paper; wepropose a new class of cube representations called Hierarchical Cubes; which is based ona design framework defined by two orthogonal dimensions. Our results show that a …,Proceedings of the 25th VLDB Conference,1999,94
Tree pattern aggregation for scalable XML data dissemination,Chee-Yong Chan; Wenfei Fan; Pascal Felber; Minos Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi,Summary With the rapid growth of XML-document traffic on the Internet; scalable content-based dissemination of XML documents to a large; dynamic group of consumers hasbecome an important research challenge. To indicate the type of content that they areinterested in; data consumers typically specify their subscriptions using some XML patternspecification language (eg; XPath). Given the large volume of subscribers; system scalabilityand efficiency mandate the ability to aggregate the set of consumer subscriptions to asmaller set of content specifications; so as to both reduce their storage-space requirementsas well as speed up the document-subscription matching process. In this paper; we providethe first systematic study of subscription aggregation where subscriptions are specified withtree patterns (an important subclass of XPath expressions).

Re-tree: an efficient index structure for regular expressions,Chee-Yong Chan; Minos Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract. Due to their expressive power; regular expressions (REs) are quickly becoming anintegral part of language specifications for several important application scenarios. Many ofthese applications have to manage huge databases of RE specifications and need toprovide an effective matching mechanism that; given an input string; quickly identifies theREs in the database that match it. In this paper; we propose the RE-tree; a novel indexstructure for large databases of RE specifications. Given an input query string; the RE-treespeeds up the retrieval of matching REs by focusing the search and comparing the inputstring with only a small fraction of REs in the database. Even though the RE-tree is similar inspirit to other tree-based structures that have been proposed for indexing multidimensionaldata; RE indexing is significantly more challenging since REs typically represent infinite …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2003,87
DTD-directed publishing with attribute translation grammars,Michael Benedikt; Chee Yong Chan; Wenfei Fan; Rajeev Rastogi; Shihui Zheng; Aoying Zhou,This chapter presents formalism and ATGs; for publishing relational data in XML with respectto a predefined DTD; and gives efficient algorithms for evaluating ATGs. There are keydifferences between ATGs and traditional attribute grammars. A traditional AG is definedwith a context free grammar and more complicated attributes (synthesized and inherited). Ittakes a string as an input; parses the string with the grammar; and computes attributes. Incontrast; it is not possible to “parse” a relational database with a DTD; thus; an ATG extractsrelevant data from the database via queries; and then constructs a parse tree of the DTDusing the data. There have also been applications of AGs to databases; for example; forconstructing query automata and for querying text files. These are mild variations oftraditional AGs and are quite different from ATGs.DTD-Directed Publishing with Attribute …,*,2002,77
Capturing both types and constraints in data integration,Michael Benedikt; Chee-Yong Chan; Wenfei Fan; Juliana Freire; Rajeev Rastogi,Abstract We propose a framework for integrating data from multiple relational sources intoan XML document that both conforms to a given DTD and satisfies predefined XMLconstraints. The framework is based on a specification language; AIG; that extends a DTD by(1) associating element types with semantic attributes (inherited and synthesized; inspiredby the corresponding notions from Attribute Grammars);(2) computing these attributes viaparameterized SQL queries over multiple data sources; and (3) incorporating XML keys andinclusion constraints. The novelty of AIG consists in semantic attributes and theirdependency relations for controlling context-dependent; DTD-directed construction of XMLdocuments; as well as for checking XML constraints in parallel with document-generation.We also present cost-based optimization techniques for efficiently evaluating AIGs …,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,74
Continuous reverse k-nearest-neighbor monitoring,Wei Wu; Fei Yang; Chee Yong Chan; Kian-Lee Tan,The processing of a Continuous Reverse k-Nearest-Neighbor (CRkNN) query on movingobjects can be divided into two sub tasks: continuous filter; and continuous refinement. Thealgorithms for the two tasks can be completely independent. Existing CRkNN solutionsemploy Continuous k-Nearest-Neighbor (CkNN) queries for both continuous filter andcontinuous refinement. We analyze the CkNN based solution and point out that when k≫ 1the refinement cost becomes the system bottleneck. We propose a new continuousrefinement method called CRange-k. In CRange-k; we transform the continuous verificationproblem into a Continuous Range-k query; which is also defined in this paper; and process itefficiently. Experimental study shows that the CRkNN solution based on our CRange-krefinement method is more efficient and scalable than the state-of-the-art CRkNN solution.,Mobile Data Management; 2008.

Taming XPath queries by minimizing wildcard steps,Chee-Yong Chan; Wenfei Fan; Yiming Zeng,Abstract This paper presents a novel and complementary technique to optimize an XPathquery by minimizing its wildcard steps. Our approach is based on using a general compositeaxis called the layer axis; to rewrite a sequence of XPath steps (all of which are wildcardsteps except for possibly the last) into a single layer-axis step. We describe an efficientimplementation of the layer axis and present a novel and efficient rewriting algorithm tominimize both non-branching as well as branching wildcard steps in XPath queries. We alsodemonstrate the usefulness of wildcard-step elimination by proposing an optimizedevaluation strategy for wildcard-free XPath queries that enables selective loading of only therelevant input XML data for query evaluation.

Sincedifferent jobs often share similar work (eg; several jobs scan the same input file or producethe same map output); there are many opportunities to optimize the performance for a batchof jobs.

Existing solutions for the problem are based on eitherusing a combination of textual and spatial indexes or using specialized hybrid indexes thatintegrate the indexing of both textual and spatial attribute values. In this paper; we propose anew approach that is based on modeling the problem as a top-k aggregation problem whichenables the design of a scalable and efficient solution that is based on the ubiquitousinverted list index.

However; none of these works haveexamined the processing of more complex queries that contain not-predicates. In this paper;we present the first study on evaluating path queries with not-predicates. We propose anefficient holistic path join algorithm; PathStack¬; which has the following advantages:(1) itrequires only one scan of the relevant data to evaluate path queries with not-predicates;(2) itdoes not generate any intermediate results; and (3) its memory space requirement isbounded by the longest path in the input XML document. We also present an improvedvariant of PathStack¬ that further minimizes unnecessary computations.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2005,36
Efficient processing of skyline queries with partially-ordered domains,C-Y Chan; P-K Eng; K-L Tan,Many decision support applications are characterized by several features:(1) the query istypically based on multiple criteria;(2) there is no single optimal answer (or answer set);(3)because of (2); users typically look for satisfying answers;(4) for the same query; differentusers; dictated by their personal preferences; may find different answers meeting theirneeds. As such; it is important for the DBMS to present all interesting answers that may fulfilla user's need. In this article; we focus on the set of interesting answers called the skyline.Given a set of points; the skyline comprises the points that are not dominated by other points.A point dominates another point if it is as good or better in all dimensions and better in atleast one dimension. We address the novel and important problem of evaluating skylinequeries involving partially-ordered attribute domains.,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005.

The experimentalperformance results show that the new heuristics perform better than existing heuristics forthe first problem and also perform better for the second problem; provided that the number ofavailable buffer pages is not much less than the optimal buffer size.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1997,32
An efficient publish/subscribe index for e-commerce databases,Dongxiang Zhang; Chee-Yong Chan; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Many of today's publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems have been designed to copewith a large volume of subscriptions and high event arrival rate (velocity). However; in manynovel applications (such as e-commerce); there is an increasing variety of items; each withdifferent attributes. This leads to a very high-dimensional and sparse database that existingpub/sub systems can no longer support effectively. In this paper; we propose an efficient in-memory index that is scalable to the volume and update of subscriptions; the arrival rate ofevents and the variety of subscribable attributes. The index is also extensible to supportcomplex scenarios such as prefix/suffix filtering and regular expression matching.

Query from examples: An iterative; data-driven approach to query construction,Hao Li; Chee-Yong Chan; David Maier,Abstract In this paper; we propose a new approach; called Query from Examples (QFE); tohelp non-expert database users construct SQL queries. Our approach; which is designed forusers who might be unfamiliar with SQL; only requires that the user is able to determinewhether a given output table is the result of his or her intended query on a given inputdatabase. To kick-start the construction of a target query Q; the user first provides a pair ofinputs: a sample database D and an output table R which is the result of Q on D. As therewill be many candidate queries that transform D to R; QFE winnows this collection bypresenting the user with new database-result pairs that distinguish these candidates. Unlikeprevious approaches that use synthetic data for such pairs; QFE strives to make thesedistinguishing pairs as close to the original (D; R) pair as possible. By doing so; it seeks to …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,25
Query reverse engineering,Quoc Trung Tran; Chee-Yong Chan; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract In this paper; we introduce a new problem termed query reverse engineering(QRE). Given a database DD and a result table TT—the output of some known or unknownquery QQ on DD—the goal of QRE is to reverse-engineer a query Q'Q′ such that the outputof query Q'Q′ on database DD (denoted by Q'(D) Q′(D)) is equal to TT (ie; Q (D) Q (D)).The QRE problem has useful applications in database usability; data analysis; and datasecurity.

Minimization of tree pattern queries with constraints,Ding Chen; Chee-Yong Chan,Abstract Tree pattern queries (TPQs) provide a natural and easy formalism to query tree-structured XML data; and the efficient processing of such queries has attracted a lot ofattention. Since the size of a TPQ is a key determinant of its evaluation cost; recent researchhas focused on the problem of query minimization using integrity constraints to eliminateredundant query nodes; specifically; TPQ minimization has been studied for the class offorward and subtype constraints (FT-constraints). In this paper; we explore the TPQminimization problem further for a richer class of FBST-constraints that includes not only FT-constraints but also backward and sibling constraints. By exploiting the properties of minimalqueries under FBST-constraints; we propose efficient algorithms to both compute a singleminimal query as well as enumerate all minimal queries.

Prefix path streaming: A new clustering method for optimal holistic XML twig pattern matching,Ting Chen; Tok Wang Ling; Chee-Yong Chan,Abstract Searching for all occurrences of a twig pattern in a XML document is an importantoperation in XML query processing. Recently a class of holistic twig pattern matchingalgorithms has been proposed. Compared with the prior approaches; the holistic methodavoids generating large intermediate results which do not contribute to the final answer. Themethod is CPU and I/O optimal when twig patterns only have ancestor-descendantrelationships. The holistic twig-pattern matching method proposed earlier [1] operates onelement streams which cluster all XML elements with the same tag name together.

The key innovation in ZINC is based on combining the strengthsof the ZB-tree; which is the state-of-the-art index method for computing skylines involvingtotally ordered domains; with a novel; nested coding scheme that succinctly maps partialorders into total orders.

Efficient XML data dissemination with piggybacking,Chee Yong Chan; Yuan Ni,Abstract Content-based dissemination of XML data using the publish-subscribe paradigm isan effective means to deliver relevant data to interested data consumers. To meet theperformance challenges of content-based filtering and routing; two key optimizations havebeen developed: the use of efficient indexes to speed up subscription filtering; and the useof effective aggregation algorithms to reduce the number of subscriptions. The effectivenessof both these techniques are; however; limited to locally improving the performance ofindividual routers. In this paper; we propose a novel and holistic optimization approach thatallows a downstream router to leverage the subscription matchings done by upstreamrouters to reduce its own filtering work. This is achieved by piggybacking useful annotationsto the XML document being forwarded.

Indexing OODB instances based on access proximity,Chee Yong Chan; Cheng Hian Goh; Beng Chin Ooi,Queries in object-oriented databases (OODBs) may be asked with respect to different classscopes: a query may either request for object-instances which belong exclusively to a givenclass c; or those which belong to any class in the hierarchy rooted at c. To facilitate retrievalof objects both from a single class as well as from multiple classes in a class hierarchy; wepropose a multi-dimensional class-hierarchy index called the/spl chi/-tree. The/spl chi/-treedynamically partitions the data space using both the class and indexed attribute dimensionsby taking into account the semantics of the class dimension as well as access patterns ofqueries.

In particular; an important class of analytic functionsthat has been frequently used in commercial systems to support OLAP and decision supportapplications is the class of window functions. A window function returns for each input tuplea value derived from applying a function over a window of neighboring tuples. However;existing window function evaluation approaches are based on a naive sorting scheme. Inthis paper; we study the problem of optimizing the evaluation of window functions. Wepropose several efficient techniques; and identify optimization opportunities that allow us tooptimize the evaluation of a set of window functions. We have integrated our scheme intoPostgreSQL.

Nearest group queries,Dongxiang Zhang; Chee-Yong Chan; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract k nearest neighbor (kNN) search is an important problem in a vast number ofapplications; including clustering; pattern recognition; image retrieval and recommendationsystems. It finds k elements from a data source D that are closest to a given query point q ina metric space. In this paper; we extend kNN query to retrieve closest elements from multipledata sources. This new type of query is named k nearest group (kNG) query; which finds kgroups of elements that are closest to q with each group containing one object from eachdata source. kNG query is useful in many location based services. To efficiently process kNGqueries; we propose a baseline algorithm using R-tree as well as an improved version usingHilbert R-tree. We also study a variant of kNG query; named kNG Join; which is analagous tokNN Join. Given a set of query points Q; kNG Join returns k nearest groups for each point …,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2013,17
Indexing techniques in decision support systems,Chee-Yong Chan,Abstract Decision support is an important application of database technology where theemphasis is on analysis of huge amounts of operational data to leverage off usefulinformation. Indexing techniques are critical to the performance of such applications; whichdemand fast response times to complex; adhoc queries on large databases. Two popularindexing techniques are bitmap indexes and precomputed cubes. While several variants ofboth techniques have been developed; there has not been any systematic study of theirdesign spaces and tradeoffs (ie; query-cost vs space-and update-costs). The maincontribution of this thesis is the presentation of a design framework for each of the aboveindexing techniques. The usefulness of these frameworks is demonstrated by the proposalof several new index designs; which were shown to exhibit significantly better tradeoffs …,*,1999,16

Optimizing complex queries with multiple relation instances,Yu Cao; Gopal C Das; Chee-Yong Chan; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Today's query processing engines do not take advantage of the multipleoccurrences of a relation in a query to improve performance. Instead; each instance istreated as a distinct relation and has its own independent table access method. In this paper;we present MAPLE; a Multi-instance-Aware PLan Evaluation engine that enables multipleinstances of a relation to share one physical scan (called SharedScan) with limited bufferspace. During execution; as SharedScan pulls a tuple for any instance; that tuple is alsopushed to the buffers of other instances with matching predicates. To avoid buffer overflow; anovel interleaved execution strategy is proposed: whenever an instance's buffer becomesfull; the execution is temporarily switched to a drainer (an ancestor blocking operator of theinstance) to consume all the tuples in the buffer. Thus; the execution is interleaved …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,15
Transaction healing: Scaling optimistic concurrency control on multicores,Yingjun Wu; Chee-Yong Chan; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Today's main-memory databases can support very high transaction rate for OLTPapplications. However; when a large number of concurrent transactions contend on thesame data records; the system performance can deteriorate significantly. This is especiallythe case when scaling transaction processing with optimistic concurrency control (OCC) onmulticore machines. In this paper; we propose a new concurrency-control mechanism;called transaction healing; that exploits program semantics to scale the conventional OCCtowards dozens of cores even under highly contended workloads. Transaction healingcaptures the dependencies across operations within a transaction prior to its execution.Instead of blindly rejecting a transaction once its validation fails; the proposed mechanismjudiciously restores any non-serializable operation and heals inconsistent transaction …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,12
Evaluation of set-based queries with aggregation constraints,Quoc Trung Tran; Chee-Yong Chan; Guoping Wang,Abstract Many applications often require finding a set of items of interest with respect tosome aggregation constraints. For example; a tourist might want to find a set of places ofinterest to visit in a city such that the total expected duration is no more than six hours andthe total cost is minimized. We refer to such queries as SAC queries for``set-based withaggregation constraints''queries. The usefulness of SAC queries is evidenced by the manyvariations of SAC queries that have been studied which differ in the number and types ofconstraints supported. In this paper; we make two contributions to SAC query evaluation. Wefirst establish the hardness of evaluating SAC queries with multiple count constraints andpresented a novel; pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for evaluating a non-trivial fragment ofSAC queries with multiple sum constraints and at most one of either count; group-by; or …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,10
Content-based dissemination of fragmented XML data,Chee-Yong Chan; Yuan Ni,Content-based dissemination of data using pub/sub systems is an effective means to deliverrelevant data to interested data consumers. With the emergence of XML as the standard fordata representation and exchange; a lot of attention has been focused on pub/sub systemsfor XML-based dissemination; where subscriptions are specified using more expressiveXML-based languages (eg; XPath). In this paper; we address the problem of matching XPath-based subscriptions on fragmented XML data; which is motivated by both the prevalance ofresource-constrained mobile devices for accessing/monitoring data as well as by theoptimization opportunities from processing data in terms of fragments. We investigateefficient strategies to schedule and optimize the evaluation of XPath-based subscriptions onXML fragments.

Sort-sharing-aware query processing,Yu Cao; Ramadhana Bramandia; Chee-Yong Chan; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Many database applications require sorting a table (or relation) over multiple sortorders. Some examples include creation of multiple indices on a relation; generation ofmultiple reports from a table; evaluation of a complex query that involves multiple instancesof a relation; and batch processing of a set of queries. In this paper; we study how tooptimize multiple sortings of a table. We investigate the correlation between sort orders andexploit sort-sharing techniques of reusing the (partial) work done to sort a table on aparticular order for another order. Specifically; we introduce a novel and powerful evaluationtechnique; called cooperative sorting; that enables sort sharing between seemingly non-related sort orders. Subsequently; given a specific set of sort orders; we determine the bestcombination of various sort-sharing techniques so as to minimize the total processing cost …,The VLDB Journal,2012,9
Optimized query evaluation using cooperative sorts,Yu Cao; Ramadhana Bramandia; Chee-Yong Chan; Kian-Lee Tan,Many applications require sorting a table over multiple sort orders: generation of multiplereports from a table; evaluation of a complex query that involves multiple instances of arelation; and batch processing of a set of queries. In this paper; we study how multiplesortings of a table can be efficiently performed. We introduce a new evaluation technique;called cooperative sort; that exploits the relationships among the input set of sort orders tominimize I/O operations for the collection of sort operations. To demonstrate the efficiency ofthe proposed scheme; we implemented it in PostgreSQL and evaluated its performanceusing both TPC-DS benchmark and synthetic data.

Efficient indexing for diverse query results,Lu Li; Chee-Yong Chan,Abstract This paper examines the problem of computing diverse query results which isuseful for browsing search results in online shopping applications. The search results arediversified wrt a sequence of output attributes (termed d-order) where an attribute thatappears earlier in the d-order has higher priority for diversification. We present a newindexing technique; D-Index; to efficiently compute diverse query results for queries withstatic or dynamic d-orders. Our performance evaluation demonstrates that our D-Indexoutperforms the state-of-the-art techniques developed for queries with static or dynamic d-orders.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,7
Efficient skyline maintenance for streaming data with partially-ordered domains,Yuan Fang; Chee-Yong Chan,Abstract We address the problem of skyline query processing for a count-based window ofcontinuous streaming data that involves both totally-and partially-ordered attribute domains.In this problem; a fixed-size buffer of the N most recent tuples is dynamically maintained andthe key challenge is how to efficiently maintain the skyline of the sliding window of N tuplesas new tuples arrive and old tuples expire. We identify the limitations of the state-of-the-artapproach STARS; and propose two new approaches; STARS+ and SkyGrid; to address itsdrawbacks. STARS+ is an enhancement of STARS with three new optimization techniques;while SkyGrid is a simplification STARS that eliminates a key data structure used in STARS.While both new approaches outperform STARS significantly; the surprising result is that thebest approach turns out to be the simplest approach; SkyGrid.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,7
Dissemination of heterogeneous XML data in publish/subscibe systems,Yuan Ni; Chee Yong Chan,Abstract The publish-subscribe paradigm is an effective approach for data publishers toasynchronously disseminate relevant data to a large number of data subscribers.

Efficient scheduling of page access in join processing,Chee Yong Chan; Beng Chin Ooi,This paper examines the issue of scheduling page access in join processing. Two relatedproblems are addressed: the determination of an optimal page access sequence such thatthe join can be computed without any page reaccesses using the minimum number of bufferpages; and the determination of an optimal page access sequence such that the join can becomputed with the minimum number of page reaccesses given a limited number of bufferpages. The first problem is believed to be NP-hard while the second problem has beenshown to be NP-complete. Efficient heuristics for both problems can optimize bufferutilization as well as disk I/O cost. By modeling a page access sequence as a concatenationof segments; we derived two desirable properties of a\PAS; which serve as the basis of ournew heuristics for solving both problems.

Fast failure recovery for main-memory dbmss on multicores,Yingjun Wu; Wentian Guo; Chee-Yong Chan; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Main-memory database management systems (DBMS) can achieve excellentperformance when processing massive volume of on-line transactions on modern multi-coremachines. But existing durability schemes; namely; tuple-level and transaction-level logging-and-recovery mechanisms; either degrade the performance of transaction processing orslow down the process of failure recovery. In this paper; we show that; by exploitingapplication semantics; it is possible to achieve speedy failure recovery without introducingany costly logging overhead to the execution of concurrent transactions. We proposePACMAN; a parallel database recovery mechanism that is specifically designed forlightweight; coarse-grained transaction-level logging.

Empirical evaluation of guarded structural indexing.,Erik Agterdenbos; George HL Fletcher; Chee-Yong Chan; Stijn Vansummeren,ABSTRACT Traditional indices in relational databases are designed for queries that areselective by value. However; queries can also retrieve records on their relational structure. Inour research; we found that traditional indices are ineffective for structurally selectivequeries. To accelerate such queries; socalled 'structural indices' have been applied in graphdatabases. These indices group together structurally similar nodes to obtain a compactrepresentation of the graph structure. We studied how structural indices can be applied inrelational databases and evaluated their performance. Guarded bisimulation groupstogether relational tuples with similar structure; which we use to obtain a guarded structuralindex. Our solution requires significantly less space than traditional indices. At the sametime; it can offer several orders of magnitude faster query evaluation performance.,EDBT,2016,1
SliceSort: efficient sorting of hierarchical data,Quoc Trung Tran; Chee-Yong Chan,Abstract Sorting is a fundamental operation in data processing. While the problem of sortingflat data records has been extensively studied; there is very little work on sorting hierarchicaldata such as XML documents. Existing hierarchy-aware sorting approaches for hierarchicaldata are based on creating sorted subtrees as initial sorted runs and merging sortedsubtrees to create the sorted output using either explicit pointers or absolute node keycomparisons for merging subtrees. In this paper; we propose SliceSort; a novel; level-wisesorting technique for hierarchical data that avoids the drawbacks of subtree-based sortingtechniques. Our experimental performance evaluation shows that SliceSort outperforms thestate-of-art approach; HErMeS; by up to a factor of 27%.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,1
On optimizing relational self-joins,Yu Cao; Yongluan Zhou; Chee-Yong Chan; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Self-join; which joins a relation with itself; is a prevalent operation in relationaldatabase systems. Despite its wide applicability; there has been little attention devoted toimproving its performance. In this paper; we present SCALE (< u> S</u> ort for< u> C</u>lustered< u> A</u> ccess with< u> L</u> azy< u> E</u> valuation); an efficient self-joinalgorithm; which takes advantage of the fact that both inputs of a self-join operation areinstances of the same relation. SCALE first sorts the relation on one join attribute; say RA Inthis way; for every value of the other join attribute; say R. B; its matching R. A tuples areessentially clustered. As SCALE scans the sorted relation; each tuple is joined with itsmatching tuples co-existing in memory. For tuples where full-range clustered accesses totheir matching tuples are not possible; they are buffered and the unfinished part of join …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2012,1

Indexed Regular Expression Matching,Chee Yong Chan; Minos Garofalakis; Rajeev Rastogi,Regular expressions (REs) provide an expressive and powerful formalism for capturing the structureof messages; events; and documents. Consequently; they have been used extensively in thespecification of a number of languages for important application domains; including the XPathpattern language for XML documents [6] and the policy language of the Border Gateway Protocol(BGP) for propagating routing information between autonomous systems in the Internet [12].Many of these applications have to manage large databases of RE specifications and need toprovide an effective matching mechanism that; given an input string; quickly identifies all theREs in the database that match it. This RE retrieval problem is therefore important for a varietyof software components in the middleware and networking infrastructure of the Internet. The REretrieval problem can be stated as follows: Given a large set S of REs over an alphabet † …,*,2008,1

Towards Neighborhood Window Analytics over Large-Scale Graphs,Qi Fan; Zhengkui Wang; Chee-Yong Chan; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Information networks are often modeled as graphs; where the vertices areassociated with attributes. In this paper; we study neighborhood window analytics; namely k-hop window query; that aims to capture the properties of a local community involving the k-hop neighbors (defined on the graph structures) of each vertex. We develop a novel index;Dense Block Index (DBIndex); to facilitate efficient processing of k-hop window queries.Extensive experimental studies conducted over both real and synthetic datasets withhundreds of millions of vertices and edges show that our proposed solutions are four ordersof magnitude faster in query performance than the non-index algorithm; and are superiorover the state-of-the-art solution in terms of both scalability and efficiency.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2016,*
Efficient processing of enumerative set-based queries,Guoping Wang; Chee-Yong Chan,Abstract Many applications often require finding sets of entities of interest that meet certainconstraints. Such set-based queries (SQs) can be broadly classified into two types:optimization SQs that involve some optimization constraint and enumerative SQs that do nothave any optimization constraint. While there has been much research on the evaluation ofoptimization SQs; there is very little work on the evaluation of enumerative SQs; whichrepresent the most fundamental fragment of set-based queries. In this paper; we address theproblem of evaluating enumerative SQs using RDBMS. While enumerative SQs can beexpressed using SQL; existing relational engines; unfortunately; are not able to efficientlyevaluate such queries due to their complexity.

Optimization of Analytic Queries in RDBMS,Yu Cao; Chee-Yong Chan; Jie Li; Kian-Lee Tan,ABSTRACT Analytic functions represent the state-of-the-art way of performing complex dataanalysis within a single SQL statement. In particular; an important class of analytic functionsthat has been frequently used in commercial systems to support OLAP and decision supportapplications is the class of window functions. A window function returns for each input tuplea value derived from applying a function over a window of neighboring tuples. However;existing window function evaluation approaches are based on a naive sorting scheme. Inthis paper; we study the problem of optimizing the evaluation of window functions. Wepropose several efficient techniques; and identify optimization opportunities that allow us tooptimize the evaluation of a set of window functions. We have integrated our scheme intoPostgreSQL. Our comprehensive experimental study on the TPC-DS datasets as well as …,*,*,*
