Perceived barriers to reporting adverse drug events in hospitals: a qualitative study using theoretical domains framework approach,Fariba Mirbaha; Gloria Shalviri; Bahareh Yazdizadeh; Kheirollah Gholami; Reza Majdzadeh,Adverse drug events (ADEs) are a major source of morbidity and mortality; estimated as theforth to sixth cause of annual deaths in the USA. Spontaneous reporting of suspected ADEsby health care professionals to a national pharmacovigilance system is recognized as auseful method to detect and reduce harm from medicines; however; underreporting is amajor drawback. Understanding the barriers to ADE reporting and thereafter design ofinterventions to increase ADE reporting requires a systematic approach and use of theory.Since multiple theories in behavior change exist that may have conceptually overlappingconstructs; a group of experts suggested an integrative framework called theoreticaldomains framework (TDF).

Crash-related factors associated with the severity of road traffic injuries in Iran,Reza Majdzadeh; Mohammad Reza Eshraghian; Kazem Khalagi; Abbas Motevalian; Kamran Naraghi,Although the impact of traffic crashes is very high in Iran; there are few works on theassociation of crash-related factors with injury severity. This study was conducted on 145drivers injured on the Qazvin-Loshan road in order to assess this association. The NewInjury Severity Score (NISS); based on the conditions of the injured drivers during their firstvisit to regional hospitals; was used as the main outcome measure. Multiple linearregression analysis was performed by considering logarithmic scale for NISS as responsevariable and adjusting for the confounding effects; including the transfer to hospitalvariables. The results showed that high-vehicle damage (ie damage with repair cost morethan 25% of the pre-crash value of the driver's vehicle) and being trapped inside the motorvehicle raised the NISS by 5.25 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.51–10.71) and 2.34 (95 …,International journal of injury control and safety promotion,2011,3

Although there aresome statistical approaches for assessing variability across studies; here we present a newapproach to heterogeneity using “MetaPlot” that investigate the influence of a single studyon the overall heterogeneity. Methods: MetaPlot is a two-way (x; y) graph; which can beconsidered as a complementary graphical approach for testing heterogeneity. This methodshows graphically as well as numerically the results of an influence analysis; in whichHiggins' I 2 statistic with 95%(Confidence interval) CI are computed omitting one study ineach turn and then are plotted against reciprocal of standard error (1/SE) or “precision”. Inthis graph;“1/SE” lies on x axis and “I 2 results” lies on y axe.
