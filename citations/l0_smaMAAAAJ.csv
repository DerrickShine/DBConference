Tail reconnection triggering substorm onset,Vassilis Angelopoulos; James P McFadden; Davin Larson; Charles W Carlson; Stephen B Mende; Harald Frey; Tai Phan; David G Sibeck; Karl-Heinz Glassmeier; Uli Auster; Eric Donovan; Ian R Mann; I Jonathan Rae; Christopher T Russell; Andrei Runov; Xu-Zhi Zhou; Larry Kepko,Magnetospheric substorms explosively release solar wind energy previously stored inEarth9s magnetotail; encompassing the entire magnetosphere and producing spectacularauroral displays. It has been unclear whether a substorm is triggered by a disruption of theelectrical current flowing across the near-Earth magnetotail; at∼ 10 RE (RE: Earth radius; or6374 kilometers); or by the process of magnetic reconnection typically seen farther out in themagnetotail; at∼ 20 to 30 R E. We report on simultaneous measurements in the magnetotailat multiple distances; at the time of substorm onset. Reconnection was observed at 20 RE; atleast 1.5 minutes before auroral intensification; at least 2 minutes before substormexpansion; and about 3 minutes before near-Earth current disruption. These resultsdemonstrate that substorms are likely initiated by tail reconnection.,Science,2008,370

Evolution and characteristics of global Pc5 ULF waves during a high solar wind speed interval,IJ Rae; EF Donovan; IR Mann; FR Fenrich; CEJ Watt; DK Milling; M Lester; B Lavraud; James A Wild; HJ Singer; H Reme; A Balogh,Abstract [1] We present an interval of extremely long-lasting narrow-band Pc5 pulsationsduring the recovery phase of a large geomagnetic storm. These pulsations occurredcontinuously for many hours and were observed throughout the magnetosphere and in thedusk-sector ionosphere. The subject of this paper is the favorable radial alignment of theCluster; Polar; and geosynchronous satellites in the dusk sector during a 3-hour subset ofthis interval that allows extensive analysis of the global nature of the pulsations and thetracing of their energy transfer from the solar wind to the ground. Virtually monochromaticlarge-amplitude pulsations were observed by the CANOPUS magnetometer chain at duskfor several hours; during which the Cluster spacecraft constellation traversed the duskmagnetopause. The solar wind conditions were very steady; the solar wind speed was …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2005,91
Multipoint observations of magnetospheric compression‐related EMIC Pc1 waves by THEMIS and CARISMA,ME Usanova; IR Mann; IJ Rae; ZC Kale; V Angelopoulos; JW Bonnell; K‐H Glassmeier; HU Auster; HJ Singer,Abstract [1] Following a long interval (many days) of sustained very quiet geomagneticconditions; electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) wave activity was seen by the CARISMAarray (www. carisma. ca) on the ground for several hours simultaneously with enhancedsolar wind density and related magnetic compression seen at GOES 12 on 29th June 2007.The THEMIS C; D; and E satellites were outbound in a “string-of-pearls” configuration andeach observed EMIC waves on L-shells ranging from 5 to 6.5. THEMIS resolved some of thespatial-temporal ambiguity and defined the radial extent of EMIC activity to be∼ 1.3 Re. Theband-limited EMIC waves were seen slightly further out in radial distance by eachsubsequent THEMIS satellite; but in each case were bounded at high-L by a decrease indensity as monitored by spacecraft potential. The EMIC wave activity appears to be …,Geophysical Research Letters,2008,88

TheTHEMIS satellites were in the evening sector conjugate to THEMIS ground-based imagers.At∼ 0507 UT there was an optical onset on inner CPS field lines. This involved near-simultaneous brightening of 1 MLT hour longitudinal segment of the onset arc. The part ofthe arc that brightened was that closest to the equatorward boundary of the diffuse (proton)aurora. Within one minute; a dipolarization front moved across four THEMIS satellites. Basedon their locations; the order in which they detected the dipolarization front; and the auroralevolution; we assert that the expansion phase began earthward of the four satellites andevolved radially outwards. We conclude that this onset occurred in an azimuthally localizedregion of highly stretched field lines.,Geophysical Research Letters,2008,77
ULF wave derived radiation belt radial diffusion coefficients,Louis G Ozeke; Ian R Mann; Kyle R Murphy; I Jonathan Rae; David K Milling; Scot R Elkington; Anthony A Chan; Howard J Singer,Abstract [1] Waves in the ultra-low-frequency (ULF) band have frequencies which can bedrift resonant with electrons in the outer radiation belt; suggesting the potential for stronginteractions and enhanced radial diffusion. Previous radial diffusion coefficient models suchas those presented by Brautigam and Albert (2000) have typically used semiempiricalrepresentations for both the ULF wave's electric and magnetic field power spectral densities(PSD) in space in the magnetic equatorial plane. In contrast; here we use ground-and space-based observations of ULF wave power to characterize the electric and magnetic diffusioncoefficients. Expressions for the electric field power spectral densities are derived fromground-based magnetometer measurements of the magnetic field PSD; and in situ AMPTEand GOES spacecraft measurements are used to derive expressions for the …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2012,60
Conjugate ground and multisatellite observations of compression‐related EMIC Pc1 waves and associated proton precipitation,ME Usanova; IR Mann; ZC Kale; IJ Rae; RD Sydora; M Sandanger; F Søraas; K‐H Glassmeier; K‐H Fornacon; H Matsui; PA Puhl‐Quinn; A Masson; X Vallières,Abstract [1] We present coordinated ground satellite observations of solar wind compression-related dayside electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves from 25 September 2005. Onthe ground; dayside structured EMIC wave activity was observed by the CARISMA andSTEP magnetometer arrays for several hours during the period of maximum compression.The EMIC waves were also registered by the Cluster satellites for half an hour; as theyconsecutively crossed the conjugate equatorial plasmasphere on their perigee passes atL∼ 5. Simultaneously; conjugate to Cluster; NOAA 17 passed through field lines supportingEMIC wave activity and registered a localized enhancement of precipitating protons withenergies> 30 keV. Our observations suggest that generation of the EMIC waves andconsequent loss of energetic protons may last for several hours while the magnetosphere …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2010,53

However; Lui incorrectly uses the auroral electrojet index insteadof ground auroral and magnetic field pulsation signatures to determine substorm onset;single velocity and magnetic field components instead of full vectors and particledistributions to identify reconnection onset; and preliminary auroral electrojet–low index (AL)instead of ground magnometer; auroral; and magnetotail data to claim pre-existing activity.,Science,2009,52
Near‐Earth initiation of a terrestrial substorm,I Jonathan Rae; Ian R Mann; Vassilis Angelopoulos; Kyle R Murphy; David K Milling; Andy Kale; Harald U Frey; Gordon Rostoker; Christopher T Russell; Clare EJ Watt; Mark J Engebretson; Mark B Moldwin; Stephen B Mende; Howard J Singer; Eric F Donovan,Abstract [1] Despite the characterization of the auroral substorm more than 40 years ago;controversy still surrounds the processes triggering substorm onset initiation. That stretchingof the Earth's magnetotail following the addition of new nightside magnetic flux from daysidereconnection powers the substorm is well understood; the trigger for explosive energyrelease at substorm expansion phase onset is not. Using ground-based data sets withunprecedented combined spatial and temporal coverage; we report the discovery of newlocalized and contemporaneous magnetic wave and small azimuthal scale auroral signatureof substorm onset. These local auroral arc undulations and magnetic field signatures rapidlyevolve on second time scales for several minutes in advance of the release of the auroralsurge. We also present evidence from a conjugate geosynchronous satellite of the …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2009,51
Timing and localization of ionospheric signatures associated with substorm expansion phase onset,I Jonathan Rae; Ian R Mann; Kyle R Murphy; David K Milling; Adrienne Parent; Vassilis Angelopoulos; Harald U Frey; Andy Kale; Clare EJ Watt; Stephen B Mende; Christopher T Russell,Abstract [1] In this paper; we present case studies of the optical and magnetic signatures ofthe characteristics of the first minute of substorm expansion phase onset observed in theionosphere. We find that for two isolated substorms; the onset of magnetic pulsations in the24–96 s period wavelet band are colocated in time and space with the formation anddevelopment of small-scale optical undulations along the most equatorward preexistingauroral arc prior to auroral breakup. These undulations undergo an inverse spatial cascadeinto vortices prior to the release of the westward traveling surge. We also present a casestudy of a multiple activation substorm; whereby discrete onsets of ULF wave power above apredetermined quiet time threshold are shown to be associated with specific opticalintensifications and brightenings. Moreover; in the multiple activation substorm event; we …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2009,41
Self‐consistent electron acceleration due to inertial Alfvén wave pulses,CEJ Watt; R Rankin; IJ Rae; DM Wright,Abstract [1] We present self-consistent kinetic simulations of the electron response to finiteduration shear Alfvén wave pulses in a magnetized plasma. In Earth's magnetosphere; theevidence suggests that parallel electric fields in inertial scale shear Alfvén waves canaccelerate electrons in the geomagnetic field-aligned direction. Here; we study large-amplitude wave forms as they travel through ambient plasma at phase velocities which areconsistent with resonant electron acceleration predicted by linear kinetic theory. Our self-consistent simulations reveal that the wave potential evolves nonlinearly as shear Alfvénwave pulses travel through the simulation domain. The evolution of the wave pulse from asymmetrical to a nonsymmetrical potential structure; and the large perturbation in thedistribution function required to carry the parallel current of the pulse; leads to …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2005,41
Wavelet‐based ULF wave diagnosis of substorm expansion phase onset,Kyle R Murphy; I Jonathan Rae; Ian R Mann; David K Milling; Clare EJ Watt; Louis Ozeke; Harald U Frey; Vassilis Angelopoulos; Christopher T Russell,Abstract [1] Using a discrete wavelet transform with a Meyer wavelet basis; we present anew quantitative algorithm for determining the onset time of Pi1 and Pi2 ULF waves in thenightside ionosphere with∼ 20-to 40-s resolution at substorm expansion phase onset. Wevalidate the algorithm by comparing both the ULF wave onset time and location to the opticalonset determined by the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE)–Far Ultraviolet Imager (FUV) instrument. In each of the six events analyzed; five substormonsets and one pseudobreakup; the ULF onset is observed prior to the global optical onsetobserved by IMAGE at a station closely conjugate to the optical onset. The observed ULFonset times expand both latitudinally and longitudinally away from an epicenter of ULF wavepower in the ionosphere. We further discuss the utility of the algorithm for diagnosing …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2009,40
Discovery of the action of a geophysical synchrotron in the Earth’s Van Allen radiation belts,Ian R Mann; EA Lee; SG Claudepierre; Joseph F Fennell; A Degeling; IJ Rae; DN Baker; GD Reeves; Harlan E Spence; LG Ozeke; R Rankin; David K Milling; A Kale; RHW Friedel; Farideh Honary,Abstract Although the Earth's Van Allen radiation belts were discovered over 50 years ago;the dominant processes responsible for relativistic electron acceleration; transport and lossremain poorly understood. Here we show evidence for the action of coherent accelerationdue to resonance with ultra-low frequency waves on a planetary scale. Data from theCRRES probe; and from the recently launched multi-satellite NASA Van Allen Probesmission; with supporting modelling; collectively show coherent ultra-low frequencyinteractions which high energy resolution data reveals are far more common than eitherpreviously thought or observed. The observed modulations and energy-dependent spatialstructure indicate a mode of action analogous to a geophysical synchrotron; this new modeof response represents a significant shift in known Van Allen radiation belt dynamics and …,Nature communications,2013,37
Optical characterization of the growth and spatial structure of a substorm onset arc,IJ Rae; Clare EJ Watt; IR Mann; KR Murphy; JC Samson; K Kabin; V Angelopoulos,Abstract [1] We present a detailed case study of the characteristics of auroral forms thatconstitute the first ionospheric signatures of substorm expansion phase onset. Analysis ofthe optical frequency and along-arc (azimuthal) wave number spectra provides the strongestconstraint to date on the potential mechanisms and instabilities in the near-Earthmagnetosphere that accompany auroral onset and which precede poleward arc expansionand auroral breakup. We evaluate the frequency and growth rates of the auroral forms as afunction of azimuthal wave number to determine whether these wave characteristics areconsistent with current models of the substorm onset mechanism. We find that the frequency;spatial scales; and growth rates of the auroral forms are most consistent with the cross-fieldcurrent instability or a ballooning instability; most likely triggered close to the inner edge …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2010,37
Ground‐based and Polar spacecraft observations of a giant (Pg) pulsation and its associated source mechanism,DM Wright; Tim K Yeoman; IJ Rae; J Storey; AB Stockton‐Chalk; JL Roeder; KJ Trattner,Abstract Multi-instrument observations of a Pg pulsation; which occurred on the morning ofMay 16; 1998; are reported. The wave signature was observed simultaneously on theground; by the International Monitor for Auroral Geomagnetic Effects (IMAGE) magnetometernetwork and in the ionosphere by the Doppler Pulsation Experiment (DOPE) high resolutionHF Doppler sounder. The wave occurred in the morning sector and possessed an azimuthalwave number; m; of 30±5 with a westward phase propagation. Shortly before the Pgcommenced; energetic particle instruments on board the Polar spacecraft detected protonswith a non-Maxwellian energy distribution drifting westward toward the location of IMAGEand DOPE.

Ionospheric localisation and expansion of long‐period Pi1 pulsations at substorm onset,David K Milling; I Jonathan Rae; Ian R Mann; Kyle R Murphy; Andy Kale; Christopher T Russell; Vassilis Angelopoulos; Stephen Mende,Abstract [1] We examine the initial ionospheric localisation and expansion of Pi1 pulsationsassociated with a substorm onset observed on 1st November 2006 with the combinedCARISMA and THEMIS GMAG network of ground-based magnetometers. We demonstratehow the first ionospheric pulsation disturbance lies in the long-period Pi1 band. The long-period Pi1 pulsations at substorm onset are initially localised in longitude; and expandsaway from an epicentre in the ionosphere; with∼ 16 s timing between stations. We furtherestablish a link between the location of the downward field-aligned current (FAC) elementwhich subsequently develops within the substorm current wedge (SCW); and the initiallocation of the onset of long-period Pi1 pulsations.

Open‐closed field line boundary position: A parametric study using an MHD model,K Kabin; R Rankin; G Rostoker; R Marchand; IJ Rae; AJ Ridley; TI Gombosi; CR Clauer; DL DeZeeuw,Abstract [1] In this paper we investigate the effect of changes in the interplanetary magneticfield (IMF); solar wind dynamic pressure; and dipole tilt angle on the position of theionospheric projection of the open-closed field line boundary (OCB) in amagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model. We carry out a large number of steady state globalMHD simulations in order to parameterize the OCB as a function of the solar wind B y and Bz which we find to have the largest effect on the OCB location. We interpolate between thevalues produced by the simulations; which allows us to evaluate the location of the OCBprojection into the ionosphere for any values of∣ B y∣< 10 nT and∣ B z∣< 10 nT. It isfound that; particularly on the nightside; the OCB position is very sensitive to changes in thenorthward IMF component B z; but it is much less sensitive to changes in B z when it is …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2004,32
Ground‐based magnetometer determination of in situ Pc4–5 ULF electric field wave spectra as a function of solar wind speed,I Jonathan Rae; Ian R Mann; Kyle R Murphy; Louis G Ozeke; David K Milling; Anthony A Chan; Scot R Elkington; Farideh Honary,Abstract [1] We present a statistical characterization of ground-based ultra-low-frequency (∼1–15 mHz) magnetic wave power spectral densities (PSDs) as a function of latitude(corresponding to dipole L-shells from L∼ 2.5–8); local time; and solar wind speed. Weshow a clear latitudinal dependence on the PSD profiles; with PSDs increasingmonotonically from low-to auroral zone latitudes; where PSDs are peaked before decay inamplitude at higher latitudes. In general; ULF wave powers are highest on the nightside;followed by the local morning; noon; and finally dusk sectors; and are well-characterizedand well-ordered by solar wind speed at all MLTs spanning L∼ 2.5–8.

Equator‐S observations of drift mirror mode waves in the dawnside magnetosphere,I Jonathan Rae; Ian R Mann; Clare EJ Watt; Lynn M Kistler; Wolfgang Baumjohann,Abstract [1] The mirror mode is a plasma instability that is typically excited in high-betaplasmas where there is significant pressure anisotropy and is most commonly observed inthe magnetosheath. However; it is possible under sufficiently anisotropic conditions togenerate the mirror instability inside the magnetosphere; though as yet there are fewexamples. We present an extended interval of∼ 7 hours of mirror mode activity on 19 March1998 when the Equator-S spacecraft was traversing the dawnside magnetosphere abovethe equatorial plane at radial distances of up to L∼ 11 and encountered quasi-monochromatic∼ 2-min oscillations in magnetic field and ion number density; temperature;and velocity. The magnetic field strength and number densities were in antiphase; and theplasma and magnetic field pressure perturbations were also in antiphase while the …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2007,30
Ground-based observations of the auroral zone and polar cap ionospheric responses to dayside transient reconnection,JA Davies; TK Yeoman; IJ Rae; SE Milan; M Lester; Mike Lockwood; A McWilliams,Observations from the EISCAT VHF incoherent scatter radar system in northern Norway;during a run of the common programme CP-4; reveal a series of poleward-propagating F-region electron density enhancements in the pre-noon sector on 23 November 1999. Theseplasma density features; which are observed under conditions of a strongly southwardinterplanetary magnetic field; exhibit a recurrence rate of under 10 min and appear toemanate from the vicinity of the open/closed field-line boundary from where they travel intothe polar cap; this is suggestive of their being an ionospheric response to transientreconnection at the day-side magnetopause (flux transfer events). Simultaneous with thedensity structures detected by the VHF radar; poleward-moving radar auroral forms(PMRAFs) are observed by the Finland HF coherent scatter radar. It is thought that PM …,*,2002,29
Inertial Alfvén waves and acceleration of electrons in nonuniform magnetic fields,CEJ Watt; R Rankin; IJ Rae; DM Wright,Abstract [1] We present results from self-consistent simulations of the electron response toshear Alfvén pulses in the presence of non-uniform magnetic fields and the associatedmirror force. We discuss how energies of resonantly accelerated beam particles are affectedby the local phase velocity of the pulse; and show that time-of-flight models are inadequatefor describing electron acceleration since the acceleration can occur at more than onelocation along the field line as the pulse propagates toward the ionosphere. We alsodemonstrate that electron conics in low-altitude satellite observations of electronacceleration can be explained in terms of field-aligned inertial Alfvén wave pulses; withoutthe requirement of a static potential drop or a standing Alfvén wave structure.,Geophysical research letters,2006,27
Ground-based Pc5 ULF wave power: Solar wind speed and MLT dependence,DM Pahud; IJ Rae; IR Mann; KR Murphy; V Amalraj,Abstract Using over 20 years of ground-based magnetometer data from theCANOPUS/CARISMA magnetometer array; we present a statistical characterisation of Pc5ultra-low frequency (ULF) power in the 2–10 mHz band as a function of magnetic local time(MLT); L-shell; and solar wind speed. We examine the power across L-shells between 4.2and 7.9; using data from the PINA; ISLL; GILL and FCHU stations; and demonstrate thatthere is a significant MLT dependence in both the H-and D-component median 2–10 mHzpower during both fast (> 500 km/s) and slow (< 500 km/s) solar wind speeds. The H-component power consistently dominates over D-component power at all MLTs and duringboth fast and slow solar wind. At the higher-L stations (L> 5.4); there are strong MLT powerpeaks in the morning and midnight local time sectors; the morning sector dominating …,Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics,2009,26
The detailed spatial structure of field‐aligned currents comprising the substorm current wedge,Kyle R Murphy; Ian R Mann; I Jonathan Rae; Colin L Waters; Harald U Frey; Andy Kale; Howard J Singer; Brian J Anderson; Haje Korth,Abstract [1] We present a comprehensive two-dimensional view of the field-aligned currents(FACs) during the late growth and expansion phases for three isolated substorms utilizing insitu observations from the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics ResponseExperiment and from ground-based magnetometer and optical instrumentation from theCanadian Array for Realtime Investigations of Magnetic Activity and Time History of Eventsand Macroscale Interactions during Substorms ground-based arrays. We demonstrate thatthe structure of FACs formed during the expansion phase and associated with the substormcurrent wedge is significantly more complex than a simple equivalent line current modelcomprising a downward FAC in the east and upward FAC in the west. This two-dimensionalview demonstrates that azimuthal bands of upward and downward FACs with periodic …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2013,25
Mapping guided Alfvén wave magnetic field amplitudes observed on the ground to equatorial electric field amplitudes in space,LG Ozeke; IR Mann; IJ Rae,Abstract [1] A technique for converting the magnetic field amplitudes of guided toroidal andguided poloidal waves observed on the ground into the equatorial electric field amplitudesof the waves in space is presented. Analytic solutions of the guided toroidal and guidedpoloidal Alfvén wave equations are used to determine the ratio of the equatorial electric fieldamplitude to the ionospheric magnetic amplitude; E eq/b i. Using these solutions; we showthat in general E eq/bi only depends very weakly on the Pedersen conductance; Σ P; and islinearly proportional to the guided Alfvén waves' frequency. We also present numericalsolutions of the guided Alfvén wave equations illustrating how the value of E eq/bi varies asa function of L shell for a range of different realistic field-aligned plasma density profiles.These results can be used to determine the equatorial wave electric field amplitude; E eq …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2009,25
Modeling ULF waves in a compressed dipole magnetic field,AW Degeling; R Rankin; K Kabin; IJ Rae; FR Fenrich,Abstract [1] This paper presents the results of a linear model for global scale magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves in a compressed dipole model magnetosphere. We examinescenarios where a localized monochromatic source along the magnetopause boundarylaunches MHD fast mode ultralow frequency (ULF) waves into the magnetosphere; wherethey couple to shear Alfvén waves. Sharply peaked field line resonance (FLR) structures arefound to form at discrete locations within the magnetosphere in response to the fast modedriver. The extent in local time and relative amplitudes of FLR structures are found to dependstrongly on the source location along the magnetopause boundary; indicating how theaddition of day/night asymmetry affects the penetration of MHD fast waves within themagnetosphere. This also suggests that observed FLR structures within the …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2010,24
Energy deposition in the ionosphere through a global field line resonance,IJ Rae; CEJ Watt; FR Fenrich; IR Mann; LG Ozeke; A Kale,We present an interval whereby we can estimate the energy dissipation in the ionospherethrough an externally-driven field line resonance. In this paper; we utilise an intervaldescribed in general by Rae et al.(2005); where the global magnetospheric cavity wasshown to be energised via a high solar wind speed stream. Using the ground-basedinstrumentation available; we estimate the spatial extent of the generated pulsations to be atleast 10° in latitude and 65° in longitude; a sizeable fraction of the dusk-sector ionosphere.Using a fortuitous conjunction with the Polar spacecraft; we compare point measurements ofthe net downward Poynting vector to the estimated Joule heating rate in the ionosphere; andfind that model values of the Pedersen conductance are reasonable. In the interval ofinterest; we estimate the total dissipation rate during a global field line resonance to be …,Annales Geophysicae,2008,23
Comparison of the open‐closed separatrix in a global magnetospheric simulation with observations: The role of the ring current,IJ Rae; K Kabin; JY Lu; R Rankin; SE Milan; FR Fenrich; Clare EJ Watt; J‐C Zhang; AJ Ridley; TI Gombosi; CR Clauer; G Tóth; DL DeZeeuw,Abstract [1] The development of global magnetospheric models; such as Space WeatherModeling Framework (SWMF); which can accurately reproduce and track space weatherprocesses has high practical utility. We present an interval on 5 June 1998; where thelocation of the polar cap boundary; or open-closed field line boundary (OCB); can bedetermined in the ionosphere using a combination of instruments during a periodencompassing a sharp northward to southward interplanetary field turning. We present bothpoint-and time-varying comparisons of the observed and simulated boundaries in theionosphere and find that when using solely the coupled ideal magnetohydrodynamicmagnetosphere-ionosphere model; the rate of change of the OCB to a southward turning ofthe interplanetary field is significantly faster than that computed from the observational …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2010,22
Timing and localization of near‐Earth tail and ionospheric signatures during a substorm onset,C Gabrielse; V Angelopoulos; A Runov; HU Frey; J McFadden; DE Larson; K‐H Glassmeier; S Mende; CT Russell; S Apatenkov; KR Murphy; IJ Rae,Abstract [1] On 16 February 2008; the THEMIS spacecraft (probes) bracketed the near-Earthsignatures of a substorm onset as identified in the THEMIS ground-based observatoriesmeasuring an AE TH index up to 180 nT. The main onset was associated with the formationand tailward release of a plasmoid (a proto-plasmoid) at X GSM=− 18.3 RE and adipolarization in the inner part of the plasma sheet at X GSM=− 11.0 R E. The time historyand geometry of the event in the tail are consistent with magnetic reconnection as the causeof the substorm expansion onset process. Two activations of the plasma sheet; evidenced bytailward streaming of energetic ions and southward or bipolar signatures of the magneticfield; preceded the main substorm. The first activation was associated with an intensificationof a high-latitude arc; while the second was associated with the onset of ULF pulsations at …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2009,21
Magnetospheric field‐line resonances: Ground‐based observations and modeling,R Rankin; K Kabin; JY Lu; IR Mann; R Marchand; IJ Rae; VT Tikhonchuk; EF Donovan,Abstract [1] We present theory and ground-based observations of field-line resonances(FLRs) excited in Earth's magnetosphere. Three FLR observations are reported; whichcorrespond to large-scale standing shear Alfvén wave (SAW) oscillations on nightside fieldlines extending from premidnight to close to dawn. The eigenfrequencies for these eventsare modeled using a nonorthogonal covariant-contravariant analysis of the idealmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. This allows us to use a general field-line topology;an example of which is computed using the Tsyganenko 1996 magnetic field model. Weshow that field-line stretching; along with assumptions regarding the distribution of densityalong field lines; is sufficient to explain the observed FLR frequencies. Then; we considerdispersive effects operating at the level of the electron inertial scale near the ionosphere …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2005,20
Explaining the dynamics of the ultra-relativistic third Van Allen radiation belt,Ian R Mann; LG Ozeke; Kyle R Murphy; SG Claudepierre; DL Turner; DN Baker; IJ Rae; A Kale; DK Milling; AJ Boyd; HE Spence; Geoffrey D Reeves; HJ Singer; S Dimitrakoudis; IA Daglis; Farideh Honary,Abstract Since the discovery of the Van Allen radiation belts over 50 years ago; anexplanation for their complete dynamics has remained elusive. Especially challenging isunderstanding the recently discovered ultra-relativistic third electron radiation belt. Currenttheory asserts that loss in the heart of the outer belt; essential to the formation of the thirdbelt; must be controlled by high-frequency plasma wave–particle scattering into theatmosphere; via whistler mode chorus; plasmaspheric hiss; or electromagnetic ion cyclotronwaves. However; this has failed to accurately reproduce the third belt. Using a data-driven;time-dependent specification of ultra-low-frequency (ULF) waves we show for the first timehow the third radiation belt is established as a simple; elegant consequence of storm-timeextremely fast outward ULF wave transport.

Effects of substorm dynamics on magnetic signatures of the ionospheric Alfvén resonator,Adrienne Parent; Ian R Mann; I Jonathan Rae,Abstract [1] Spectral resonance structures (SRS) of the ionospheric Alfvén resonator (IAR)measured by the induction magnetometer at the High Frequency Active Auroral ResearchProgram (HAARP) ionospheric observatory during a substorm on 28 February 2006 arepresented. The evolution of IAR SRS is compared to ionospheric parameters measured bythe colocated Digisonde; riometer and all-sky imager at HAARP. Initially; the magnetic IARsignatures (spectral resonance structures) exhibited an expected variation that can beattributed to typical diurnal changes in ionospheric structure. At substorm onset; thesignatures disappeared because of either a suppression of resonance conditions bysubstorm-related particle precipitation or enhanced power in the Pc1 spectrum thatconcealed continuing IAR SRS. After the substorm; the SRS reappeared; however the …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2010,19
Comparison of photometer and global MHD determination of the open‐closed field line boundary,IJ Rae; K Kabin; R Rankin; FR Fenrich; W Liu; JA Wanliss; AJ Ridley; TI Gombosi; DL De Zeeuw,Abstract [1] We compare open-closed field line boundary positions from the BATS-R-USGlobal MHD model and CANOPUS photometer measurements of red-line emissions. Wechoose intervals of steady interplanetary and ionospheric conditions in order to adhere tothe “steady-state” picture that we are trying to address. Nine intervals are chosen thatcorrespond to stable IMF and auroral conditions that can be simulated with the MHD model.We find that on average; the steady-state BATS-R-US MHD model provides an excellentestimate of the open-closed field line boundary proxy as determined by the red-line auroralemissions. Typical errors between the model calculations of the open-closed field lineboundary and the observations are within the inherent error in using the red-line emissions.,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2004,19
Reduction in field‐aligned currents preceding and local to auroral substorm onset,Kyle R Murphy; Ian R Mann; I Jonathan Rae; Colin L Waters; Brian J Anderson; David K Milling; Howard J Singer; Haje Korth,Abstract [1] We examine the global field-aligned current (FAC) topology associated with aclear substorm on the 16 February 2010. We show that for this particular substorm there is aclear and localised reduction in the FACs observed by AMPERE at least 6 minutes prior toauroral onset. A new auroral arc forms in the region of reduced FAC and on closed fieldlines which subsequently brightens and expands poleward; signifying the start of thesubstorm expansion phase. We argue that the change in FACs observed prior to onset is theresult of a change in the magnetosphere-ionosphere (MI) coupling in a region local to thesubsequent auroral onset. Such a change implies an important role for MI coupling indestabilising the near-Earth tail during magnetospheric substorms and perhaps moreimportantly in selecting the location in the ionosphere where auroral onset begins.,Geophysical Research Letters,2012,18

We report on THEMIS in-situ and ground-based observations during a substormbetween 04: 30∼ 04: 50 UT on 22 February 2008. The spacecraft (probes) were alignedalong the tail between XGSM=− 5 RE to− 25 RE. The most distant probe P1 (X=− 24.5 RE)detected two successive tailward moving bipolar magnetic structures. P2 (X=− 18 RE); P3(X=− 11 RE); P4 (X=− 10.5 RE) all captured signatures related to the Earthward movementof a magnetic structure. THEMIS ground stations and all-sky imagers also recorded Pi2pulsations and a sudden brightening in a white-light auroral imager followed by polewardexpansion. We perform a detailed timing analysis of probe and ground-based data andreconstruct the time sequence of phenomena during this substorm. The earliest sign ofsubstorm onset was the bipolar perturbation in the northward component of the magnetic …,Ann. Geophys,2009,18
Magnetospheric quasi‐static response to the dynamic magnetosheath: A THEMIS case study,Karl‐Heinz Glassmeier; Hans‐Ulrich Auster; Dragoş Constantinescu; Karl‐Heinz Fornaçon; Yasuhito Narita; Ferdinand Plaschke; Vassilis Angelopoulos; Edita Georgescu; Wolfgang Baumjohann; Werner Magnes; Rumi Nakamura; Charles W Carlson; Sabine Frey; James P McFadden; Tai Phan; Ian Mann; I Jonathan Rae; Joachim Vogt,Abstract [1] Earth's magnetosphere is buffeted by the time-varying solar wind. For the firsttime; the THEMIS mission; with its five spacecraft; directly allows to compare measurementsin the magnetosheath and their response in the magnetopause boundary region; and theouter magnetosphere to this buffeting. During the time interval studied; the spacecraft movedalmost along the stagnation streamline allowing to use Bernoulli's law to relate localobservations of the plasma density; temperature; flow velocity; and magnetic field to thestagnation pressure. Magnetopause distance and velocity are determined assuming a quasi-static response. The dynamics inferred is compared with actual observations by three of theTHEMIS spacecraft. Assuming a radially moving Chapman-Ferraro current layer also theouter magnetospheric magnetic field response is modelled and compared with magnetic …,Geophysical Research Letters,2008,18
A physical explanation for the magnetic decrease ahead of dipolarization fronts.,ZH Yao; J Liu; CJ Owen; C Forsyth; IJ Rae; ZY Pu; HS Fu; X-Z Zhou; QQ Shi; AM Du; RL Guo; XN Chu,Abstract. Recent studies have shown that the ambient plasma in the near-Earth magnetotailcan be compressed by the arrival of a dipolarization front (DF). In this paper we study thevariations in the characteristics of currents flowing in this compressed region ahead of theDF; particularly the changes in the cross-tail current; using observations from the THEMISsatellites. Since we do not know whether the changes in the cross-tail current lead to a field-aligned current formation or just form a current loop in the magnetosphere; we thus useredistribution to represent these changes of local current density. We found that (1) theredistribution of the cross-tail current is a common feature preceding DFs;(2) theredistribution of cross-tail current is caused by plasma pressure gradient ahead of the DFand (3) the resultant net current redistributed by a DF is an order of magnitude smaller …,Annales Geophysicae (09927689),2015,17
Statistical analysis of ground based magnetic field measurements with the field line resonance detector,F Plaschke; KH Glassmeier; OD Constantinescu; IR Mann; DK Milling; U Motschmann; IJ Rae,Abstract. In this paper we introduce the field line resonance detector (FLRD); a wavetelescope technique which has been specially adapted to estimate the spectral energydensity of field line resonance (FLR) phase structures in a superposed wave field. The fieldline resonance detector is able to detect and correctly characterize several superposed FLRstructures of a wave field and therefore constitutes a new and powerful tool in ULF pulsationstudies. In our work we derive the technique from the classical wave telescope beamformerand present a statistical analysis of one year of ground based magnetometer data from theCanadian magnetometer network CANOPUS; now known as CARISMA. The statisticalanalysis shows that the FLRD is capable of detecting and characterizing superposed orhidden FLR structures in most of the detected ULF pulsation events; the one year …,Annales geophysicae: atmospheres; hydrospheres and space sciences,2008,17

In situ spatiotemporal measurements of the detailed azimuthal substructure of the substorm current wedge,C Forsyth; AN Fazakerley; IJ Rae; CE J Watt; K Murphy; James A Wild; Tomas Karlsson; Robert Mutel; CJ Owen; Robert Ergun; A Masson; Matthieu Berthomier; E Donovan; HU Frey; Juergen Matzka; Claudia Stolle; Y Zhang,Abstract The substorm current wedge (SCW) is a fundamental component of geomagneticsubstorms. Models tend to describe the SCW as a simple line current flowing into theionosphere toward dawn and out of the ionosphere toward dusk; linked by a westwardelectrojet. We use multispacecraft observations from perigee passes of the Cluster 1 and 4spacecraft during a substorm on 15 January 2010; in conjunction with ground-basedobservations; to examine the spatial structuring and temporal variability of the SCW. At thistime; the spacecraft traveled east-west azimuthally above the auroral region. We show thatthe SCW has significant azimuthal substructure on scales of 100 km at altitudes of 4000–7000 km. We identify 26 individual current sheets in the Cluster 4 data and 34 individualcurrent sheets in the Cluster 1 data; with Cluster 1 passing through the SCW 120–240 s …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2014,16
The role of ultralow frequency waves in radiation belt dynamics,Ian R Mann; Kyle R Murphy; Louis G Ozeke; I Jonathan Rae; David K Milling; Andy A Kale; Farideh F Honary,This paper reviews the role of long-period ultralow frequency (ULF) waves in contributing tothe acceleration; transport; and loss of electrons in the outer zone Van Allen radiation belt.We place particular emphasis on the mesoscale and global-scale characterization of ULFwaves around electron drift orbits available from groundbased magnetometer arrays; whichcomplement conjugate single-point in situ satellite measurements. We examine the timedomain relationship between 1–10 mHz ULF wave power and driving solar wind speed;demonstrating a close connection; which could contribute to explaining the Paulikas andBlake (1979) correlation between radiation belt electron flux and solar wind speed. Wereview both coherent and stochastic transport processes; such as radial diffusion; which canarise from resonant ULF wave-particle interactions.

Electrodynamics of magnetosphere‐ionosphere coupling and feedback on magnetospheric field line resonances,JY Lu; R Rankin; R Marchand; IJ Rae; Wenbin Wang; SC Solomon; J Lei,Abstract [1] We present a new dynamic model that describes coupling between standinginertial or ion-acoustic-gyroradius-scale shear Alfvén waves; compressional modes; andauroral density disturbances. The model is applied to the excitation of field line resonances(FLRs) in dipolar and stretched geomagnetic fields in Earth's magnetosphere.Magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling is included by accounting for the closure ofmagnetospheric field-aligned currents (FACs) through Pedersen currents in the ionosphere.A second new aspect is that the height-integrated Pedersen conductivity is treated as adynamic parameter by electrodynamically coupling the two-dimensional finite element wavemodel “Topo” to the ionospheric ionization model “Global Airglow Model (GLOW).” Wedemonstrate that field line stretching brings the equatorial plasma β above unity; where …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2007,16
Statistical characterization of the growth and spatial scales of the substorm onset arc,Nadine ME Kalmoni; I Jonathan Rae; Clare EJ Watt; Kyle R Murphy; Colin Forsyth; Christopher J Owen,Abstract We present the first multievent study of the spatial and temporal structuring of theaurora to provide statistical evidence of the near-Earth plasma instability which causes thesubstorm onset arc. Using data from ground-based auroral imagers; we study repeatablesignatures of along-arc auroral beads; which are thought to represent the ionosphericprojection of magnetospheric instability in the near-Earth plasma sheet. We show that thegrowth and spatial scales of these wave-like fluctuations are similar across multiple events;indicating that each sudden auroral brightening has a common explanation. We findstatistically that growth rates for auroral beads peak at low wave number with the mostunstable spatial scales mapping to an azimuthal wavelength λ≈ 1700–2500 km in theequatorial magnetosphere at around 9–12 R E. We compare growth rates and spatial …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2015,15
Electromagnetic waves generated by ionospheric feedback instability,JY Lu; Wenbin Wang; R Rankin; R Marchand; Jiuhou Lei; SC Solomon; IJ Rae; J‐S Wang; G‐M Le,Abstract [1] A new interactive MI coupling model that describes the dynamic interactionbetween magnetospheric dispersive waves; compressional modes; and auroral electronprecipitations is applied to investigate the geomagnetic electromagnetic pulsationsobserved in Earth's magnetosphere in terms of magnetospheric waves triggered byionospheric feedback instability. Two new aspects of this work are that (1) we treat the fullnonlinear MHD equations; ie; include the full compressional modes and their coupling withshear Alfvén waves in the magnetosphere; and (2) the height-integrated Pedersenconductivity is treated as a dynamic parameter by electrodynamically coupling the 2D finiteelement wave model “TOPO” to the ionospheric ionization model “GLOW”. It is shown thatthe feedback instability can be triggered by a very small-scale; small amplitude density …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2008,15
The correlation of ULF waves and auroral intensity before; during and after substorm expansion phase onset,I Jonathan Rae; Clare EJ Watt; Kyle R Murphy; Harald U Frey; Louis G Ozeke; David K Milling; Ian R Mann,Abstract [1] We present case studies of the evolution of Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) magneticwave amplitudes and auroral intensity through the late growth phase and the expansionphase of the substorm cycle. We present strong evidence that substorm-related auroralenhancements are clearly and demonstrably linked to ULF wave amplitudes observed at thesame location. In all three case studies presented; the correlation analysis shows that theULF wave activity and auroral intensities are highly correlated at close to zero lag. Wediscuss four possible explanations that may be able to explain both the timing and the highcorrelations between these two phenomena; including a simple coincidence; an artifact ofinstrumental effects; the response of the ionosphere to magnetic waves and auroral particleprecipitation; and finally; that ULF waves and auroral particle precipitation are physically …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2012,14
Multiple field line resonances: Optical; magnetic and absorption signatures,IJ Rae; IR Mann; ZC Dent; DK Milling; EF Donovan; E Spanswick,Abstract We present multi-instrument observations of ultra low frequency (ULF) wave activityfrom the dawn flank magnetosphere during the period 12: 00–13: 30 UT on the 16December 2003. Optical; magnetic and riometer measurements from the Churchill linemeridian in the Canadian sector are presented which demonstrate the presence of multiplediscrete auroral arc structures accompanied by periodic magnetic and riometer absorptionperturbations in the Pc5 (150–600 s) ULF band. Clear polewards propagation isdemonstrated in all the instrument data sets; the magnetic signals showing most clearly theamplitude and phase characteristics consistent with discrete frequency field line resonances(FLRs) on closed field lines. Two discrete frequency field line resonant signals are apparent;at 1.8 and 3.0 mHz which resonate at approximately the same latitude. We explain this via …,Planetary and Space Science,2007,14
First radar observations in the vicinity of the plasmapause of pulsed ionospheric flows generated by bursty bulk flows,NA Frissell; JBH Baker; JM Ruohoniemi; LBN Clausen; ZC Kale; IJ Rae; L Kepko; K Oksavik; RA Greenwald; ML West,Abstract [1] Recent expansion of the SuperDARN network to mid-latitudes and the additionof a new high-time resolution mode provides new opportunities to observe mid-latitude ultra-low frequency waves and other ionospheric sub-auroral features at high temporal resolution.On 22 February 2008; the Blackstone SuperDARN radar and THEMIS groundmagnetometers simultaneously observed substorm Pi2 pulsations. Similarities inmeasurements from the Blackstone radar and a magnetometer at Remus suggest a commongenerating mechanism. Cross-phase analysis of magnetometer data places thesemeasurements at the ionospheric projection of the plasmapause; while fine spatial andtemporal details of the radar data show evidence of field line compressions. About 1 minprior to ground Pi2 observation; 2 Earthward-moving Bursty Bulk Flows (BBFs) were …,Geophysical Research Letters,2011,13
Comprehensive ground‐based and in situ observations of substorm expansion phase onset,AP Walsh; IJ Rae; AN Fazakerley; KR Murphy; IR Mann; Clare EJ Watt; M Volwerk; C Forsyth; HJ Singer; EF Donovan; TL Zhang,Abstract [1] In this paper; we present comprehensive ground-based and space-based in situgeosynchronous observations of a substorm expansion phase onset on 1 October 2005.The Double Star TC-2 and GOES-12 spacecraft were both located within the substormcurrent wedge during the substorm expansion phase onset; which occurred over theCanadian sector. We find that an onset of ULF waves in space was observed after onset onthe ground by extending the AWESOME timing algorithm into space. Furthermore; apopulation of low-energy field-aligned electrons was detected by the TC-2 PEACEinstrument contemporaneous with the ULF waves in space. These electrons appear to beassociated with an enhancement of field-aligned Poynting flux into the ionosphere which islarge enough to power visible auroral displays. The observations are most consistent with …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2010,13
Solar wind modulation of cusp particle signatures and their associated ionospheric flows,IJ Rae; FR Fenrich; M Lester; KA McWilliams; JD Scudder,Abstract [1] This paper presents a multi-instrument case study of the northern polar cusp at avariety of altitudes in conjunction with solar wind measurements. In the midaltitude cusp thePolar spacecraft observed pulsed particle and magnetic field signatures with periodicitiesranging from∼ 5 to 40 min for over 3 hours. Simultaneously; the CUTLASS HF radarsmeasured poleward moving radar auroral forms (PMRAFs) with inter-PMRAF periods similarto the Polar periodicities but several degrees of magnetic latitude poleward of theionospheric footprint of the spacecraft. Such PMRAFs have previously been identified asionospheric signatures of transient reconnection and flux transfer events. During this event;both the ACE and Wind spacecraft were making measurements in the solar wind.Oscillations in the time-shifted solar wind magnetic fields and flows and calculated …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2004,13
Current reduction in a pseudo‐breakup event: THEMIS observations,ZH Yao; ZY Pu; CJ Owen; SY Fu; XN Chu; J Liu; V Angelopoulos; IJ Rae; C Yue; X‐Z Zhou; Q‐G Zong; X Cao; QQ Shi; C Forsyth; AM Du,Abstract Pseudo-breakup events are thought to be generated by the same physicalprocesses as substorms. This paper reports on the cross-tail current reduction in an isolatedpseudo-breakup observed by three of the THEMIS probes (THEMIS A (THA); THEMIS D(THD); and THEMIS E (THE)) on 22 March 2010. During this pseudo-breakup; severallocalized auroral intensifications were seen by ground-based observatories. Using theunique spatial configuration of the three THEMIS probes; we have estimated the inertial anddiamagnetic currents in the near-Earth plasma sheet associated with flow braking anddiversion. We found the diamagnetic current to be the major contributor to the currentreduction in this pseudo-breakup event. During flow braking; the plasma pressure wasreinforced; and a weak electrojet and an auroral intensification appeared. After flow …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2014,12
The dependence of Pi2 waveforms on periodic velocity enhancements within bursty bulk flows,KR Murphy; IJ Rae; IR Mann; AP Walsh; DK Milling; A Kale,Abstract Pi2s are a category of Ultra Low Frequency (ULF) waves associated with the onsetof magnetic substorms. Recent work has suggested that the deceleration of bulk plasmaflows in the central plasmasheet; known as bursty bulk flows (BBFs); are able to directly-drive Pi2 oscillations. Some of these studies have further shown evidence that there is a one-to-one correlation between Pi2 magnetic waveforms observed on the ground and periodicpeaks in flow velocity within the BBF; known as flow bursts. Utilising a favourableconjunction between the Geotail spacecraft and the Canadian Array for Real-timeInvestigations of Magnetic Activity (CARISMA) magnetometer array on 31 May 1998; weexamine the causality of the link between BBF flow bursts and Pi2 waveforms. Using aseries of analytical tests in both the time and frequency domains; we find that while the …,Annales Geophysicae,2011,12

Coordinated observation of field line resonance in the mid-tail,Yunlin Jacques Zheng; ATY Lui; IR Mann; K Takahashi; J Watermann; S-H Chen; IJ Rae; T Mukai; CT Russell; A Balogh; RF Pfaff; H Reme,Standing Alfvén waves of 1.1 mHz (~ 15 min in period) were observed by the Clustersatellites in the mid-tail during 06: 00-07: 00 UT on 8 August 2003. Pulsations with the samefrequency were also observed at several ground stations near Cluster's footpoint. Thestanding wave properties were determined from the electric and magnetic fieldmeasurements of Cluster. Data from the ground magnetometers indicated a latitudinalamplitude and phase structure consistent with the driven field line resonance (FLR) at 1.1mHz. Simultaneously; quasi-periodic oscillations at different frequencies were observed inthe post-midnight/early morning sector by GOES 12 (l 0˜ 8.7); Polar (l 0˜ 11-14) and Geotail (l0˜ 9.8). The 8 August 2003 event yields rare and interesting datasets.

A new technique for determining Substorm Onsets and Phases from Indices of the Electrojet (SOPHIE),C Forsyth; IJ Rae; JC Coxon; MP Freeman; CM Jackman; J Gjerloev; AN Fazakerley,Abstract We present a new quantitative technique that determines the times and durations ofsubstorm expansion and recovery phases and possible growth phases based on percentilesof the rate of change of auroral electrojet indices. By being able to prescribe differentpercentile values; we can determine the onset and duration of substorm phases for smalleror larger variations of the auroral index or indeed any auroral zone ground-basedmagnetometer data. We apply this technique to the SuperMAG AL (SML) index and compareour expansion phase onset times with previous lists of substorm onsets. We find that morethan 50% of events in previous lists occur within 20 min of our identified onsets. We alsopresent a comparison of superposed epoch analyses of SML based on our onsets identifiedby our technique and existing onset lists and find that the general characteristics of the …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2015,11
Modeling cross L shell impacts of magnetopause shadowing and ULF wave radial diffusion in the Van Allen belts,Louis G Ozeke; Ian R Mann; Drew L Turner; Kyle R Murphy; Alex W Degeling; I Jonathan Rae; David K Milling,Abstract We present simulations of the outer electron radiation belt using a new ULF wave-driven radial diffusion model; including empirical representations of loss due to chorus andplasmaspheric hiss. With an outer boundary condition constrained by in situ electron fluxobservations; we focus on the impacts of magnetopause shadowing and outward radialdiffusion in the heart of the radiation belt. Third invariant conserving solutions are combinedto simulate the L shell and time dependence of the differential flux at a fixed energy. Resultsfor the geomagnetically quiet year of 2008 demonstrate not only remarkable cross L shellimpacts from magnetopause shadowing but also excellent agreement with the in situobservations even though no internal acceleration source is included in the model.

Sources of electron pitch angle anisotropy in the magnetotail plasma sheet,Andrew P Walsh; AN Fazakerley; C Forsyth; CJ Owen; MGGT Taylor; IJ Rae,Abstract [1] We survey the properties of electron pitch angle distributions in the magnetotailplasma sheet at a distance between 15 and 19 RE from the Earth; using data from thePlasma Electron and Current Experiment (PEACE) instrument. We limit our survey to thosepitch angle distributions measured when the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) had beensteadily northward or steadily southward for the previous 3 h. We find that; at sub-keVenergies; the plasma sheet electron pitch angle distribution has an anisotropy such thatthere is a higher differential energy flux of electrons in the (anti-) field-aligned directions.Fitting the measured pitch angle distributions with both a single and two component kappadistribution reveals that this anisotropy is the result of the presence of a second; cold;component of electrons that is observed more often than not; and occurs during both the …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2013,11
On the nature of ULF wave power during nightside auroral activations and substorms: 2. Temporal evolution,IJ Rae; KR Murphy; Clare EJ Watt; IR Mann,Abstract [1] We present a statistical analysis of the time evolution of ground magneticfluctuations in three (12–48 s; 24–96 s and 48–192 s) period bands during nightside auroralactivations. We use an independently derived auroral activation list composed of bothsubstorms and pseudo-breakups to provide an estimate of the activation times of nightsideaurora during periods with comprehensive ground magnetometer coverage. One hundredeighty-one events in total are studied to demonstrate the statistical nature of the timeevolution of magnetic wave power during the∼ 30 min surrounding auroral activations. Wefind that the magnetic wave power is approximately constant before an auroral activation;starts to grow up to 90 s prior to the optical onset time; maximizes a few minutes after theauroral activation; then decays slightly to a new; and higher; constant level.

Inner magnetospheric onset preceding reconnection and tail dynamics during substorms: Can substorms initiate in two different regions?,Kyle R Murphy; Ian R Mann; I Jonathan Rae; Andrew P Walsh; Harald U Frey,Abstract We present a detailed ground-based and in situ examination of two substorms on 9April 2011 providing one of the most detailed observations of a series of activations to date.Using auroral observations we demonstrate that the initial signature of substorm onset is alocalized brightening on closed field lines. In both cases auroral onset precedes anygeosynchronous indications of substorm onset. Despite excellent in situ coverage of thenear-midnight plasma sheet there is no evidence of tail flows or topological changes whichmight indicate the initiation of reconnection and related disturbances prior to auroral onset.Similarly; no auroral streamers are observed prior to either onset. For the second substorm;following auroral onset and dipolarization of the geosynchronous field there is evidence of arapid thinning of the plasma sheet followed by a secondary auroral activation and …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2014,10
Field line resonances as a trigger and a tracer for substorm onset,I Jonathan Rae; KR Murphy; CEJ Watt; G Rostoker; R Rankin; IR Mann; CR Hodgson; HU Frey; AW Degeling; C Forsyth,Abstract In this paper; we show that periodic auroral arc structures are seen at the location ofone particular auroral substorm onset for the 15 min preceding onset; suggesting that fieldline resonances should be considered a strong candidate for triggering substorm onset.Irrespective of whether this field line resonance is coincidentally or causally linked to thissubstorm onset; the characteristics of the field line resonance can be used to remote sensethe characteristics of the geomagnetic field line that supports substorm onset. In thisinstance; the eigenfrequency of this resonance is around 12 mHz. Interestingly; however;there is no evidence of this field line resonance in a seven satellite major Time History ofEvents and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS)-GOES conjunction; rangingfrom geosynchronous orbit to~ 30 R E. However; using space-based cross-phase …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2014,10
High‐latitude GPS TEC changes associated with a sudden magnetospheric compression,PT Jayachandran; C Watson; IJ Rae; JW MacDougall; DW Danskin; R Chadwick; TD Kelly; P Prikryl; K Meziane; K Shiokawa,Abstract [1] Using ionospheric total electron content (TEC) measured by Global PositioningSystem (GPS) receivers of the Canadian High Arctic Ionospheric Network (CHAIN) weprovide clear evidence for a systematic and propagating temporary TEC enhancementproduced by compression of the magnetosphere due to a sudden increase in solar winddynamic pressure. The magnetospheric compression is evident in THEMIS/GOES satellitedata. Application of a GPS triangulation technique revealed that the TEC changespropagated with a speed of 3–6 km/s in the antisunward direction near noon and∼ 8 km/s inthe sunward direction in the pre-noon lower latitude sector. Characteristics of these TECchanges along with riometer absorption measurements seems to indicate that the TECchange is due to electron density enhancement in the F region and is possibly due to …,Geophysical Research Letters,2011,10
Ultralow‐frequency modulation of whistler‐mode wave growth,Clare EJ Watt; AW Degeling; R Rankin; KR Murphy; IJ Rae; HJ Singer,Abstract [1] Measurements from ground-based magnetometers and riometers at aurorallatitudes have demonstrated that energetic (∼ 30–300 keV) electron precipitation can bemodulated in the presence of magnetic field oscillations at ultralow frequencies. It haspreviously been proposed that an ultralow-frequency (ULF) wave would modulate field andplasma properties near the equatorial plane; thus modifying the growth rates of whistler-mode waves. In turn; the resulting whistler-mode waves would mediate the pitch anglescattering of electrons resulting in ionospheric precipitation. In this paper; we investigate thishypothesis by quantifying the changes to the linear growth rate expected due to a slowchange in the local magnetic field strength for parameters typical of the equatorial regionaround 6.6RE radial distance. To constrain our study; we determine the largest possible …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2011,10

ULF wave–driven radial diffusion simulations of the outer radiation belt,Louis G Ozeke; Ian R Mann; Kyle R Murphy; I Jonathan Rae; Anthony A Chan,MeV energy electrons are thought to be transported inward from the plasma sheet into theradiation belts under the action of radial diffusion driven by waves in the ULF band. Currentradiation belt models use radial diffusion coefficients; which are separated into a term due toelectromagnetic fluctuations and a term due to electrostatic fluctuations; such as thosepresented by Brautigam and Albert (2000). In contrast; here we model the dynamics of theouter radiation belt electrons during the CRRES era using radial diffusion coefficient derivedfrom 15 years of ground-based magnetometer and~ 10 years of in situ spacecraftmeasurements; which are separated into a term due to electric field fluctuations and a termdue to magnetic field fluctuations. These simulations are compared with electron fluxsimulations over the same time interval with the diffusion coefficients presented by …,Dynamics of the Earth's radiation belts and inner magnetosphere,2012,9
The impact of an ICME on the Jovian X‐ray aurora,William R Dunn; Graziella Branduardi‐Raymont; Ronald F Elsner; Marissa F Vogt; Laurent Lamy; Peter G Ford; Andrew J Coates; G Randall Gladstone; Caitriona M Jackman; Jonathan D Nichols; I Jonathan Rae; Ali Varsani; Tomoki Kimura; Kenneth C Hansen; Jamie M Jasinski,Abstract We report the first Jupiter X-ray observations planned to coincide with aninterplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME). At the predicted ICME arrival time; weobserved a factor of∼ 8 enhancement in Jupiter's X-ray aurora. Within 1.5 h of thisenhancement; intense bursts of non-Io decametric radio emission occurred. Spatial;spectral; and temporal characteristics also varied between ICME arrival and another X-rayobservation two days later. Gladstone et al.(2002) discovered the polar X-ray hot spot andfound it pulsed with 45 min quasiperiodicity. During the ICME arrival; the hot spot expandedand exhibited two periods: 26 min periodicity from sulfur ions and 12 min periodicity from amixture of carbon/sulfur and oxygen ions.

Plasmasheet pressure increases to balance magnetic flux density increases in the lobes. Here weexamine plasma sheet pressure; density; and temperature during substorm growth phasesusing 9 years of Cluster data (> 316;000 data points). We show that plasma sheet pressureand temperature are higher during growth phases with higher solar wind driving; whereasthe density is approximately constant.

We discuss how energization of the plasma sheet before onset mayresult from thermodynamically adiabatic processes; how hotter plasma sheets may result …,Geophysical research letters,2014,7
Magnetospheric convection and magnetopause shadowing effects in ULF wave‐driven energetic electron transport,AW Degeling; R Rankin; K Murphy; IJ Rae,Abstract [1] Magnetospheric radiation belt electron transport in the presence of ULF wavesand a convection electric field is investigated using a model that includes a nightside plasmasheet source and electron losses by magnetopause shadowing. Narrow-band ULF waveslaunched from a prescribed dayside magnetopause source are shown to interact withtrapped and untrapped equatorially mirroring electrons within the magnetosphere. Formagnetic moments less than 8 keV/nT and a strong convection electric field (in the order of 5mV/m); we find that a limb of untrapped plasma sheet electrons extending across thedayside magnetosphere into the afternoon sector provides a phase space density (PSD)source for injection to lower L-shells by ULF waves; causing a rapid enhancement in PSD.However; the same ULF wave activity gives rise to a rapid dropout in PSD for electrons …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2013,7

The solar wind emanating from the Sun is their ultimate energy source;but the chain of plasma physical processes leading to auroral displays is complex. Thespecial conditions at the interface between the solar wind-driven magnetosphere and theionospheric environment at the top of Earth's atmosphere play a central role. In this AuroralAcceleration Region (AAR) persistent electric fields directed along the magnetic fieldaccelerate magnetospheric electrons to the high energies needed to excite luminosity whenthey hit the atmosphere. The “ideal magnetohydrodynamics” description of space plasmaswhich is useful in much of the magnetosphere cannot be used to understand the AAR. TheAAR has been studied by a small number of single spacecraft missions which revealed …,Experimental Astronomy,2012,7
Dependence of ground-based Pc5 ULF wave power on F10. 7 solar radio flux and solar cycle phase,Kyle R Murphy; Ian R Mann; I Jonathan Rae; David K Milling,Abstract Utilising fifteen (1990–2005) years of ground-based magnetometer data from fourmagnetometer stations; we characterise the statistical dependence of the Pc5 ULF wavepower spectra on variations in F10. 7 solar radio flux and on solar cycle phase. We showthat the median Pc5 ULF wave power spectra can be characterised as a power-law with alocalised Gaussian centred at a specific frequency superimposed on the power-lawspectrum. Further; we demonstrate that the location of the Gaussian in frequencysystematically varies with both solar cycle phase and F10. 7 and is more pronounced duringhigh-speed solar wind intervals. We postulate that the localised power spectrumenhancement (or Gaussian) is a manifestation of the local eigenfrequency of field lineresonances in the Earth's magnetosphere and that the variation in the location of the …,Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics,2011,7
Multi-instrument observations of ULF wave-driven discrete auroral arcs propagating sunward and equatorward from the poleward boundary of the duskside auroral...,JT Mathews; IR Mann; IJ Rae; J Moen,An investigation into how discrete frequency fast mode waves propagating sunward from themagnetotail may drive field line resonant Alfvén waves on closed field lines on the afternoonflank of the Earth's magnetosphere is presented. Due to the morphology of the magnetic fieldlines on the flank; higher latitude poleward boundary auroral field lines map deeper into themagnetotail; implying that phase lags from mode coupling to sunward propagating fastmode waves in this stretched field geometry can overcome the standard poleward phasepropagation of typical field line resonances; producing resonant Alfvén wave-driven discreteauroral arcs that propagate equatorward on closed field lines. A comparison is madebetween the predicted results and magnetometer; all sky camera and meridian scanningphotometer observations of multiple east–west aligned discrete auroral arcs that …,Physics of Plasmas,2004,7
Combined THEMIS and ground‐based observations of a pair of substorm‐associated electron precipitation events,Mark A Clilverd; Craig J Rodger; I Jonathan Rae; James B Brundell; Neil R Thomson; Neil Cobbett; Pekka T Verronen; Frederick W Menk,Abstract [1] Using ground-based subionospheric radio wave propagation data from two verylow frequency (VLF) receiver sites; riometer absorption data; and THEMIS satelliteobservations; we examine in detail energetic electron precipitation (EEP) characteristicsassociated with two substorm precipitation events that occurred on 28 May 2010. In anadvance on the analysis undertaken by Clilverd et al.(2008); we use phase observations ofVLF radio wave signals to describe substorm-driven EEP characteristics more accuratelythan before. Using a> 30 keV electron precipitation flux of 5.6× 10 7 el. cm− 2 sr− 1 s− 1 anda spectral gradient consistent with that observed by THEMIS; it was possible to accuratelyreproduce the peak observed riometer absorption at Macquarie Island (L= 5.4) and theassociated NWC radio wave phase change observed at Casey; Antarctica; during the …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2012,6
A direct examination of the dynamics of dipolarization fronts using MMS,ZH Yao; IJ Rae; RL Guo; AN Fazakerley; CJ Owen; R Nakamura; W Baumjohann; Clare EJ Watt; KJ Hwang; BL Giles; CT Russell; RB Torbert; A Varsani; HS Fu; QQ Shi; X‐J Zhang,Abstract Energy conversion on the dipolarization fronts (DFs) has attracted much researchattention through the suggestion that intense current densities associated with DFs canmodify the more global magnetotail current system. The current structures associated with aDF are at the scale of one to a few ion gyroradii; and their duration is comparable to aspacecraft's spin period. Hence; it is crucial to understand the physical mechanisms of DFswith measurements at a timescale shorter than a spin period. We present a case studywhereby we use measurements from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) Mission; whichprovides full 3-D particle distributions with a cadence much shorter than a spin period. Weprovide a cross validation amongst the current density calculations and examine theassumptions that have been adopted in previous literature using the advantages of MMS …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2017,5
What effect do substorms have on the content of the radiation belts?,C Forsyth; IJ Rae; KR Murphy; MP Freeman; C‐L Huang; HE Spence; AJ Boyd; JC Coxon; CM Jackman; NME Kalmoni; CEJ Watt,Abstract Substorms are fundamental and dynamic processes in the magnetosphere;converting captured solar wind magnetic energy into plasma energy. These substorms havebeen suggested to be a key driver of energetic electron enhancements in the outer radiationbelts. Substorms inject a keV “seed” population into the inner magnetosphere which issubsequently energized through wave-particle interactions up to relativistic energies;however; the extent to which substorms enhance the radiation belts; either directly orindirectly; has never before been quantified. In this study; we examine increases anddecreases in the total radiation belt electron content (TRBEC) following substorms andgeomagnetically quiet intervals. Our results show that the radiation belts are inherentlylossy; shown by a negative median change in TRBEC at all intervals following substorms …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2016,4
Substructures within a dipolarization front revealed by high‐temporal resolution Cluster observations,Zhonghua Yao; AN Fazakerley; A Varsani; IJ Rae; CJ Owen; D Pokhotelov; C Forsyth; RL Guo; SC Bai; ST Yao; N Doss,Abstract The dipolarization front (DF); usually observed near the leading edge of a burstybulk flow (BBF); is thought to carry an intense current sufficient to modify the large-scale near-Earth magnetotail current system. However; the physical mechanism of the currentgeneration associated with DFs is poorly understood. This is primarily due to the limitationsof conventional plasma instruments which are unable to provide a sufficient number ofunaliased 3-D distribution functions on the timescale of the DF; which usually travels past aspacecraft in only a few seconds. It is thus almost impossible to unambiguously determinethe detailed plasma structure of the DF at the usual temporal resolution of such instruments.Here we present detailed plasma measurements using the Cluster Plasma Electron andCurrent Experiment and Cluster Ion Spectrometry-Composition and Distribution Function …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2016,4
On the nature of ULF wave power during nightside auroral activations and substorms: 1. Spatial distribution,Kyle R Murphy; I Jonathan Rae; Ian R Mann; David K Milling,Abstract [1] We present the results of a statistical analysis of ground-based magnetometerUltra Low Frequency (ULF) wave power and polarization during substorm expansion phaseonset in three ULF wave bands; the longer-period Pi1 (10–40 s) band; the Pi1-2 (24–96 s)band; and Pi2 (40–150 s) wave band; in order to determine whether these wave bands arestatistically disparate phenomena during expansion phase onset. Utilizing over 800nightside auroral activations and substorms identified by the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) satellite; we characterize the two-dimensional spatialdistribution of ULF wave power; angle of azimuth; and ellipticity with respect to the spatialand temporal onset of the initial auroral brightening as observed by IMAGE. We determinethe statistical ULF wave power spectra observed during substorm expansion phase onset …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2011,4
Polar observations of the time‐varying cusp,IJ Rae; M Lester; SE Milan; TA Fritz; M Grande; JD Scudder,Abstract We present a multi-instrument case study of the signatures associated with the cuspobserved by the Charge and Mass Magnetospheric Ion Composition Experiment(CAMMICE); Hot Plasma Analyzer (HYDRA) and Magnetic Fields Experiment (MFE)instruments onboard the Polar satellite between 0900 and 1300 UT on October 29; 1996.Characteristic signatures of the midaltitude cusp include ions of energies 10 2–10 4 eV;electrons of energies 10–10 3 eV; and a structured depression in the local magnetic field.During this cusp pass; ion fluxes in the 1–20 keV range were modulated quasi-periodicallyon timescales of between 12 and 20 min; while energy-dispersed ion count rates wereobserved close to the open-closed field line boundary.

Auroral streamer and its role in driving wave-like pre-onset aurora,Zhonghua Yao; ZY Pu; IJ Rae; Aikaterini Radioti; MV Kubyshkina,Abstract The time scales of reconnection outflow; substorm expansion; and development ofinstabilities in the terrestrial magnetosphere are comparable; ie; from several to tens ofminutes; and their existence is related. In this paper; we investigate the physical relationsamong those phenomena with measurements during a substorm event on January 29;2008. We present conjugate measurements from ground-based high-temporal resolution all-sky imagers and in situ THEMIS measurements. An auroral streamer (north–south alignedthin auroral layer) was formed and propagated equatorward; which usually implies anearthward propagating plasma flow in the magnetotail. At the most equatorward part of theauroral streamer; a wave-like auroral band was formed aligning in the east–west direction.The wave-like auroral structure is usually explained as a consequence of instability …,Geoscience Letters,2017,3
Identifying intervals of temporally invariant field‐aligned currents from Swarm: Assessing the validity of single‐spacecraft methods,C Forsyth; IJ Rae; IR Mann; IP Pakhotin,Abstract Field-aligned currents (FACs) are a fundamental component of coupled solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere. By assuming that FACs can be approximated by stationaryinfinite current sheets that do not change on the spacecraft crossing time; single-spacecraftmagnetic field measurements can be used to estimate the currents flowing in space. Bycombining data from multiple spacecraft on similar orbits; these stationarity assumptions canbe tested. In this technical report; we present a new technique that combines crosscorrelation and linear fitting of multiple spacecraft measurements to determine the reliabilityof the FAC estimates. We show that this technique can identify those intervals in which thecurrents estimated from single-spacecraft techniques are both well correlated and havesimilar amplitudes; thus meeting the spatial and temporal stationarity requirements.

Accurately characterizing the importance of wave‐particle interactions in radiation belt dynamics: The pitfalls of statistical wave representations,Kyle R Murphy; Ian R Mann; I Jonathan Rae; David G Sibeck; Clare EJ Watt,Abstract Wave-particle interactions play a crucial role in energetic particle dynamics in theEarth's radiation belts. However; the relative importance of different wave modes in thesedynamics is poorly understood. Typically; this is assessed during geomagnetic storms usingstatistically averaged empirical wave models as a function of geomagnetic activity inadvanced radiation belt simulations. However; statistical averages poorly characterizeextreme events such as geomagnetic storms in that storm-time ultralow frequency wavepower is typically larger than that derived over a solar cycle and Kp is a poor proxy for storm-time wave power.,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2016,3
ULF waves above the nightside auroral oval during substorm onset,IJ Rae; Clare EJ Watt,Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves propagating in Earth's magnetotail represent afundamental method for the transfer of energy and momentum throughout themagnetosphere–ionosphere system. Rapid changes in magnetotail stresses are mediatedbetween the magnetosphere and ionosphere via ultra‐low‐frequency (ULF) waves. Amagnetotail dipolarization can be thought of as a compressional or rarefaction waveprogressing outwards from the inner magnetosphere; and shear Alfvén waves carry thecurrent that couples the magnetosphere to the ionosphere; creating current systems such asthe substorm current wedge (SCW) as well as those currents responsible for generating theaurora. Decades of research have shown the importance of ULF waves during substorms. Inthis chapter; we review historical ground‐based observations of ULF waves tied to …,Low-Frequency Waves in Space Plasmas,2016,3
Comment on “Formation of substorm Pi2: A coherent response to auroral streamers and currents” by Y. Nishimura et al.,I Jonathan Rae; Kyle R Murphy; David M Miles; Clare EJ Watt; Ian R Mann,[1] In their recent paper; Nishimura et al.[2012]; hereafter termed N12; conclude that Pi2magnetic field pulsations and auroral brightenings in the substorm expansion phase aredriven coherently by flow bursts in the magnetotail. The authors claim not only that the flowbursts; auroral brightenings; and magnetic field perturbations all have periodicities in the Pi2range but significantly also that the individual perturbations are all coherent and; as aconsequence; infer a causal and one-to-one connection between them. In their scenario;fast earthward flows in the plasma sheet with fine structure in the Pi2 frequency range areresponsible; in a piecewise and coherent fashion; for establishing one-by-one additionalelements of the substorm current wedge (SCW) in response to each element of the flowburst fine structure. In other words; each subsequent flow burst adds an additional current …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2013,3
Pi2 pulsation periodicity and variations in magnetotail flows,KR Murphy; A Kale; IJ Rae; IR Mann; ZC Dent,Abstract: Pi2 pulsations are a category of ULF waves with periods between 40–150 secondsfrequently observed by ground-based magnetometers predominantly during substorm onset.The origin of these pulsations has been attributed to the coupling of Alfvénic oscillationsassociated with the generation of the substorm current wedge; and fast-mode compressionalwaves moving radially inward from the tail; including plasmaspheric cavity modes at low-latitudes. It has recently been suggested that the frequencies of observed night-side auroralzone and low-latitude Pi2 pulsations; or Pi2 waveforms on the flanks; may be due to periodicvariations in the sunward plasma flow from the tail such as during multiple bursty bulk flows(BBFs). Using a favourable conjunction of the Geotail satellite with the CARISMAgroundbased magnetometers on 23rd December 2000; the relationship between the …,Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Substorms (ICS-8),2006,3

Two fundamentally different drivers of dipolarizations at Saturn,ZH Yao; D Grodent; LC Ray; IJ Rae; AJ Coates; ZY Pu; AT Lui; A Radioti; JH Waite; GH Jones; RL Guo; WR Dunn,Abstract Solar wind energy is transferred to planetary magnetospheres via magnetopausereconnection; driving magnetospheric dynamics. At giant planets like Saturn; rapid rotationand internal plasma sources from geologically active moons also drive magnetosphericdynamics. In both cases; magnetic energy is regularly released via magnetospheric currentredistributions that usually result in a change of the global magnetic field topology (namedsubstorm dipolarization at Earth). Besides this substorm dipolarization; the front boundary ofthe reconnection outflow can also lead to a strong but localized magnetic dipolarization;named a reconnection front. The enhancement of the north-south magnetic component isusually adopted as the indicator of magnetic dipolarization. However; this field increasealone cannot distinguish between the two fundamentally different mechanisms. Using …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2017,2
Statistical azimuthal structuring of the substorm onset arc: implications for the onset mechanism,NME Kalmoni; IJ Rae; KR Murphy; C Forsyth; CEJ Watt; CJ Owen,Abstract The onset of an auroral substorm is generally thought to occur on a quiet;homogeneous auroral arc. We present a statistical study of independently selected substormonset arcs and find that over 90% of the arcs studied have resolvable characteristic spatialscales in the form of auroral beads. We find that the vast majority (~ 88%) of auroral beadshave small amplitudes relative to the background; making them invisible without quantitativeanalysis. This confirms that auroral beads are highly likely to be ubiquitous to all onset arcs;rather than a special case phenomena as previously thought. Moreover; as these auroralbeads grow exponentially through onset; we conclude that a magnetospheric plasmainstability is fundamental to substorm onset itself.,Geophysical Research Letters,2017,2
Discovery of co-rotating magnetic reconnection in Saturn's magnetosphere,Zhonghua Yao; AJ Coates; LC Ray; IJ Rae; Denis Grodent; GH Jones; MK Dougherty; CJ Owen; RL Guo; W Dunn; A Radioti; ZY Pu; GR Lewis; JH Waite; J-C Gerard,Abstract: Magnetic reconnection; as a fundamental energy conversion mechanism; canexplosively convert energy contained in a magnetic field into ionised particles in solarsystem; astrophysical plasmas and laboratory plasmas. Planetary magnetic reconnectioncan be driven by solar wind energy or planetary internal energy. Externally drivenprocesses; from the solar wind; have been extensively investigated at Earth and Mercury.Internally driven processes dictate important dynamics in giant planetary magnetospheres;However; it is not yet established how this process drives magnetospheric energy releaseand re-loading.

Effects of ULF wave power on relativistic radiation belt electrons: 8–9 October 2012 geomagnetic storm,D Pokhotelov; IJ Rae; KR Murphy; IR Mann; L Ozeke,Abstract Electromagnetic ultralow-frequency (ULF) waves are known to play a substantialrole in radial transport; acceleration; and loss of relativistic particles trapped in the Earth'souter radiation belt. Using in situ observations by multiple spacecraft operating in the vicinityof outer radiation belts; we analyze the temporal and spatial behavior of ULF wavesthroughout the geomagnetic storm of 8–9 October 2012 and compare with the dynamics ofrelativistic electron fluxes on board the twin Van Allen Probes spacecraft. The analysisshows that the relativistic electron fluxes reduce from their prestorm levels during the firstphase of the storm and rapidly increase during the second phase of the storm. Wedemonstrate that the behavior of ULF wave power changes throughout the storm; from ULFoscillations being a mixture of compressional and shear magnetic components during the …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2016,2
The influence of solar wind variability on magnetospheric ULF wave power,D Pokhotelov; IJ Rae; KR Murphy; IR Mann,Magnetospheric ultra-low frequency (ULF) oscillations in the Pc 4–5 frequency range playan important role in the dynamics of Earth's radiation belts; both by enhancing the radialdiffusion through incoherent interactions and through the coherent drift-resonant interactionswith trapped radiation belt electrons. The statistical distributions of magnetospheric ULFwave power are known to be strongly dependent on solar wind parameters such as solarwind speed and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) orientation. Statistical characterisation ofULF wave power in the magnetosphere traditionally relies on average solar wind–IMFconditions over a specific time period. In this brief report; we perform an alternativecharacterisation of the solar wind influence on magnetospheric ULF wave activity throughthe characterisation of the solar wind driver by its variability using the standard deviation …,Annales Geophysicae,2015,2
Using ultra-low frequency waves and their characteristics to diagnose key physics of substorm onset,IJ Rae; KR Murphy; Clare EJ Watt; Ian R Mann; Zhonghua Yao; Nadine ME Kalmoni; Colin Forsyth; David K Milling,Abstract Substorm onset is marked in the ionosphere by the sudden brightening of anexisting auroral arc or the creation of a new auroral arc. Also present is the formation ofauroral beads; proposed to play a key role in the detonation of the substorm; as well as thedevelopment of the large-scale substorm current wedge (SCW); invoked to carry the currentdiversion. Both these phenomena; auroral beads and the SCW; have been intimately relatedto ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves of specific frequencies as observed by ground-basedmagnetometers. We present a case study of the absolute and relative timing of Pi1 and Pi2ULF wave bands with regard to a small substorm expansion phase onset. We find that thereis both a location and frequency dependence for the onset of ULF waves. A clear epicentreis observed in specific wave frequencies concurrent with the brightening of the substorm …,Geoscience Letters,2017,1
Corotating magnetic reconnection site in Saturn’s magnetosphere,ZH Yao; AJ Coates; LC Ray; IJ Rae; Denis Grodent; Geraint H Jones; MK Dougherty; CJ Owen; RL Guo; WR Dunn; Aikaterini Radioti; ZY Pu; GR Lewis; JH Waite; J-C Gérard,Abstract Using measurements from the Cassini spacecraft in Saturn's magnetosphere; wepropose a 3D physical picture of a corotating reconnection site; which can only be driven byan internally generated source. Our results demonstrate that the corotating magneticreconnection can drive an expansion of the current sheet in Saturn's magnetosphere and;consequently; can produce Fermi acceleration of electrons. This reconnection site lasted forlonger than one of Saturn's rotation period. The long-lasting and corotating natures of themagnetic reconnection site at Saturn suggest fundamentally different roles of magneticreconnection in driving magnetospheric dynamics (eg; the auroral precipitation) from theEarth. Our corotating reconnection picture could also potentially shed light on the fastrotating magnetized plasma environments in the solar system and beyond.,The Astrophysical Journal Letters,2017,1

The evolution of solar wind strahl with heliospheric distance,GA Graham; IJ Rae; CJ Owen; AP Walsh; CS Arridge; L Gilbert; GR Lewis; GH Jones; C Forsyth; AJ Coates; JH Waite,Abstract Field-aligned beams of suprathermal electrons; known as “strahl;” are a frequentlyobserved constituent of solar wind plasma. However; the formation and interplanetaryevolution of the strahl electron populations has yet to be fully understood. As strahl electronstravel away from the Sun; they move into regions of decreasing magnetic field strength andthus are subject to adiabatic focusing. However; the widths of strahl pitch angle distributionsobserved at 1 AU are significantly broader than expected. Previous investigations havefound that the average observed strahl pitch angle width actually increases with heliocentricradial distance. This implies that strahl electrons must be subjected to some form of pitchangle scattering process or processes; details of which as of yet remain elusive. In thispaper; we use Cassini electron measurements to examine strahl beams across a …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2017,1
Identifying the magnetotail lobes with Cluster magnetometer data,JC Coxon; CM Jackman; Mervyn P Freeman; Colin Forsyth; I Jonathan Rae,Abstract We describe a novel method for identifying times when a spacecraft is in Earth'smagnetotail lobes solely using magnetometer data. We propose that lobe intervals can bewell identified as times when the magnetic field is strong and relatively invariant; definedusing thresholds in the magnitude of BX and the standard deviation σ of the magnetic fieldmagnitude. Using data from the Cluster spacecraft at downtail distances greater than 8 REduring 2001–2009; we find that thresholds of 30 nT and 3.5 nT; respectively; optimizeagreement with a previous; independently derived lobe identification method that used bothmagnetic and plasma data over the same interval.

Furthermore; our method identifies the lobe on many other occasions when …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2016,1
Automated determination of auroral breakup during the substorm expansion phase using all‐sky imager data,Kyle R Murphy; David M Miles; Clare EJ Watt; I Jonathan Rae; Ian R Mann; Harald U Frey,Abstract This paper describes a novel method for quantitatively and routinely identifyingauroral breakup following substorm onset using the Time History of Events and MacroscaleInteractions during Substorms all-sky imagers. Substorm onset is characterized by abrightening of the aurora that is followed by auroral poleward expansion and auroralbreakup. This breakup can be identified by a sharp increase in the auroral intensity i (t) andthe time derivative of auroral intensity i (t). Utilizing both i (t) and i'(t); we have developed analgorithm for identifying the time interval and spatial location of auroral breakup during thesubstorm expansion phase based solely on quantifiable characteristics of the optical auroralemissions. We compare the time interval determined by the algorithm to independentlyidentified auroral onset times from three previously published studies. In each case the …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2014,1
Characterization of Intense ULF Wave Power Spectra During the``Halloween''2003 Geomagnetic Storm,IR Mann; TM Loto'Aniu; ZC Dent; LG Ozeke; DK Milling; IJ Rae; CL Waters,Abstract Large amplitude Pc5 ULF waves observed by the CANOPUS; IMAGE and SAMNETmagnetometer arrays are characterized during the Halloween 2003 storm. Following stormonset; very large ULF power in discrete frequencies penetrates to very low-L shellsspanning in the entire outer radiation belt and into the slot region. This is especiallypronounced during 29th October 2003; coincident with the inwards motion of the outerradiation belt into the slot. ULF power is observed with discrete spectral peaks; and usingmultiple arrays we characterize the global structure of the ULF spectra and examine theexcitation of latitudinally localized power enhancements. Comparing the observed waves tothe cross-phase derived Alfven continuum; we determine the role of localized discrete fieldline resonances in the accumulation of this ULF wave power.

An Event Comparison of Global MHD Simulation and SuperDARN HF Radar in the North Polar Cusp,FR Fenrich; IJ Rae; SP Slinker; JA Fedder; GJ Sofko,Abstract On June 5; 1998 a number of the Northern Hemisphere SuperDARN HF radarsrecorded good backscatter in the cusp region from~ 14: 00 to 16: 00 UT; from which maps ofionospheric convection and backscatter widths have been derived. For comparison the time-varying Lyon-Fedder Global MHD model of this event has been simulated using IMP-8 andWIND spacecraft measurements of solar wind input. The time interval of interest ischaracterized by negative IMF Bz and negative IMF By following a positive IMF Bz interval.Good correspondence is found between the MHD model and the SuperDARN ionosphericconvection patterns confirming that this is an excellent event for a detailed comparison ofmodel and observation.

The discovery of pulsed; energy-dispersed ioninjections on newly-opened field lines (Pulsed Particle Signatures; or PPSs); themagnetospheric plasma signatures of transient reconnection; is one such advancement inour knowledge. Utilising a∼ 22 months subset of Polar's mission; we perform a statisticalstudy of the dayside traversals of the cusp region by the spacecraft to determine the extentand location of PPSs as well as the prevailing Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) conditionsunder which they occur. In this paper we report upon the broad extent of these signatures inlatitude and local time regardless of IMF orientation; and show that PPSs occur under …,Geophysical research letters,2002,1

Magnetosphere-ionosphere Coupling for the Steady-state Solar Wind Conditions of November 26 2000,K Kabin; R Rankin; FR Fenrich; IJ Rae; R Marchand; TI Gombosi; DL DeZeeuw; AJ Ridley,Abstract In recent years three-dimensional magnetosphere models based on idealMagnetohydrodynamics have become increasingly popular. In this work we use BATS-R-US; an ideal MHD model developed at the University of Michigan to simulate a particularevent characterized by fairly steady solar wind conditions. November 26 2000 had severalhours of steady southward IMF. This event is particularly interesting because of theunusually high solar wind parameters: the density was as high as 40 particles per cc and themagnitude of the magnetic field was about 30 nT. We consider the coupling of themagnetosphere and ionosphere and compare the ionospheric convection patterns andcross-polar cap potentials in the model with those determined from the SuperDARN network.In our simulation we reproduce the typical two-cell convection pattern in the ionosphere …,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,2001,1

Investigating the seasonal variation ofCDPS occurrences will help us better understand the long term variation of plasmaexchange between the solar wind and magnetosphere; but any seasonal variation of CDPSoccurrences has not yet been reported in the literature. In this paper; we investigate theseasonal variation of the occurrence rate of CDPS using Geotail data from 1996 to 2015 andfind a semiannual variation of the CDPS occurrences. Given the higher probability of solarwind entry under stronger northward IMF conditions; twenty years of IMF data (1996-2015)are used to investigate the seasonal variation of IMF Bz under northward IMF conditions.

As reported by Baker et al. 3;the September 2012 geomagnetic storm produced this phenomena; and we showed1 howsuch losses could explain it. However; Shprits et al. claim that for this single specific stormthat electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) wave losses are essential for explaining theobserved third belt. We dispute this interpretation. Contrary to the claims of Shprits et al.;outward ULF wave radial diffusion can act on sufficiently short timescales4 to generate theobserved remnant belt.

Variations of high-latitude geomagnetic pulsation frequencies: A comparison of time-of-flight estimates and IMAGE magnetometer observations,JK Sandhu; TK Yeoman; MK James; IJ Rae; RC Fear,The fundamental eigenfrequencies of standing Alfvén waves on closed geomagnetic fieldlines are estimated for the region spanning 5.9≤ L< 9.5 over all MLT (Magnetic Local Time).The T96 magnetic field model and a realistic empirical plasma mass density model areemployed using the time-of-flight approximation; refining previous calculations that assumeda relatively simplistic mass density model. An assessment of the implications of usingdifferent mass density models in the time-of-flight calculations is presented. The calculatedfrequencies exhibit dependences on field line footprint magnetic latitude and MLT; which areattributed to both magnetic field configuration and spatial variations in mass density.

One key reason is the lackof simultaneous measurements in the magnetosphere while remote sensing of the aurora.We report a dynamic auroral event identified with the Cassini Ultraviolet ImagingSpectrograph (UVIS) at Saturn on 13 July 2008 with coordinated measurements of themagnetic field and plasma in the magnetosphere. The auroral intensification was transient;only lasting for∼ 30 min. The magnetic field and plasma are perturbed during the auroralintensification period. We suggest that this intensification was caused by wave modeconversion generated field-aligned currents; and we propose two potential mechanisms forthe generation of this plasma wave and the transient auroral intensification.

Dawn‐Dusk Asymmetries in Ultra‐Low‐Frequency Waves,I Jonathan Rae,ABSTRACT Ultra‐low‐frequency (ULF) waves are a fundamental component ofmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave processes that transfer energy and momentumthroughout the solar wind; magnetosphere; and ionosphere. We present a brief outline of thehistorical context of ULF waves; in order to review the characteristics of ULF wavesthroughout the magnetosphere and ionosphere; and discuss the potential reasons for theirdawn‐dusk asymmetries; including both sources external and internal to themagnetosphere. We discuss the consequences of any dawn‐dusk asymmetries withparticular reference to their potential impact on the inner magnetosphere; or ring current andradiation belt region; and their impact on the ionosphere through enhanced Joule heating.,Dawn-Dusk Asymmetries in Planetary Plasma Environments,2017,*
The parameterization of wave‐particle interactions in the Outer Radiation Belt,Clare EJ Watt; IJ Rae; KR Murphy; C Anekallu; SN Bentley; C Forsyth,Abstract We explore the use of mean value empirical wave models in diffusion models of theOuter Radiation Belt. We show that magnetospheric wave power is not normally distributedin time and that geomagnetic activity does not provide a deterministic proxy for the temporalvariability of wave activity. Our findings indicate that current diffusion models significantlyoverestimate the action of wave-particle interactions due to extremely low frequency andvery low frequency waves in the magnetosphere. We suggest that other techniques such asstochastic parameterization will lead to a better characterization of subgrid diffusion physicsin the Outer Radiation Belt.,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2017,*
Birkeland currents during substorms: Statistical evidence for intensification of Regions 1 and 2 currents after onset and a localised signature of auroral dimming,John C Coxon; I Jonathan Rae; Colin Forsyth; Caitriona M Jackman; Robert C Fear; Brian J Anderson,Abstract We conduct a superposed epoch analysis of Birkeland current densities fromAMPERE (Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment)using isolated substorm expansion phase onsets identified by an independently deriveddataset. In order to evaluate whether R1 and R2 currents contribute to the substorm currentwedge; we rotate global maps of Birkeland currents into a common coordinate systemcentred on the MLT of substorm onset. When the latitude of substorm is taken into account; itis clear that both R1 and R2 current systems play a role in substorm onset; contrary toprevious studies which found that R2 current did not contribute. The latitude of substormonset is co-located with the interface between R1 and R2 currents; allowing us to infer thatR1 current closes just tailward and R2 current closes just Earthward of the associated …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,2017,*

Impacts of intense inward and outward ULF wave radial diffusion on the Van Allen belts,Ian Mann; Louis Ozeke; I Jonathan Rae; Kyle Murphy,Abstract During geomagnetic storms; the power in ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves can beorders of magnitude larger than that predicted by statistics determined from an entire solarcycle. This is especially true during the main phase and early recovery phase. Theseperiods of enhanced storm-time ULF wave power can have significant impacts on themorphology and structure of the Van Allen belts. Either fast inward or outward radialdiffusion can result; depending on the profiles of the electron phase space density and theouter boundary condition at the edge of the belts. Small changes in the time sequence ofpowerful ULF waves; and the time sequence of any magnetopause shadowing or therecovery of plamasheet sources relative to the ULF wave occurrence; have a remarkableimpact on the resulting structure of the belts.

Microscale dynamics within Kelvin Helmholtz waves: A probe of localized reconnection occurrence,Ali Varsani; Christopher J Owen; Andrew N Fazakerley; I Jonathan Rae; Colin Forsyth; Andrew P Walsh; Mats André; Iannis Dandouras; Christopher M Carr,Abstract Interactions between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere at themagnetopause are the key to the mixing of these two plasma regimes. During periods ofnorthward IMF; an absence of low latitude reconnection at the magnetopause is expected.However; this gives rise to questions as to how the low latitude boundary layer (LLBL) canbe populated with magnetosheath-like plasma under these conditions. Cluster multi-spacecraft observations have shown the existence of non-linear waves at themagnetopause that are thought to be results of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability; these waves cangrow and form rolled-up vortices. It has been postulated that reconnection within thesevortices may be the cause of transfer the solar wind plasma into the magnetosphere.However; the particle behaviour at these small scales is yet to be fully understood.

Observations of High Frequency Harmonics of the Ionospheric Alfven Resonator,Ian Mann; Maria Usanova; Jacob Bortnik; David Milling; Andy Kale; Leo Shao; David Miles; I Jonathan Rae,Abstract We present observations of high frequency harmonics of the ionospheric AlfvenResonator (IAR). These are seen in the form of spectral resonance structures (SRS)recorded by a ground-based search coil magnetometer sampling at 100 samples/s at theMinistik Lake station at L= 4.2 within the expanded CARISMA magnetometer array.

Role of ULF Waves in Radiation Belt and Ring Current Dynamics,IR Mann; KR Murphy; IJ Rae; L Ozeke; DK Milling,Abstract Ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves in the Pc4-5 band can be excited in themagnetosphere by the solar wind. Much recent work has shown how ULF wave power isstrongly correlated with solar wind speed. However; little attention has been paid thedynamics of ULF wave power penetration onto low L-shells in the inner magnetosphere. Weuse more than a solar cycle of ULF wave data; derived from ground-based magnetometernetworks; to examine this ULF wave power penetration and its dependence on solar windand geomagnetic activity indices. In time domain data; we show very clearly that daysideULF wave power; spanning more than 4 orders of magnitude; follows solar wind speedvariations throughout the whole solar cycle-during periods of sporadic solar maximumICMEs; during declining phase fast solar wind streams; and at solar minimum; alike.

A localized initiation of the substorm expansion phase and decoupling of the inner magnetosphere and tail during the substorm growth and expansion phases,KR Murphy; IR Mann; IJ Rae; HU Frey,Abstract We present a detailed ground-based and in-situ examination of two substorms on9th April 2011 utilising multi-point observations from the THEMIS probes and ground-basedASIs and geosynchronous GOES satellites. Using auroral observations we demonstrate; forboth substorms; that the initial signature of substorm onset is a localised brightening; onclosed field lines; and wavelike azimuthal expansion of the aurora. In both cases auroralonset precedes geosynchronous observations of substorm onset including a rapidenhancement of low energy ions and electrons and topological change of thegeosynchronous field.

Changes in Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Coupling and FACs Associated with Substorm Onset,KR Murphy; IR Mann; IJ Rae; CL Waters; BJ Anderson; H Korth; DK Milling; HJ Singer; HU Frey,Abstract Field aligned currents (FACs) are crucial for the communication of informationbetween the ionosphere and magnetosphere.

In particular; for an isolated substorm on 16February 2010 we demonstrate a clear and localized reduction in the FACs at least 6minutes prior to auroral onset. A new auroral arc forms in the region of reduced FAC onclosed field lines and initially expands azimuthally in wave like fashion. This newly formedarc continues to brighten and expands poleward signifying the start of the substormexpansion phase.

Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Coupling due to shear Alfven waves: Implications for Substorm Onset,CE Watt; R Rankin; IJ Rae,Abstract Shear Alfven waves are a natural plasma mode which propagates along themagnetic field; transmitting energy and information. In the Earth's magnetosphere; shearAlfven waves have been shown to be related to substorm onset; perhaps being the mediumby which information regarding the initiation region may propagate to the ionosphere. Theremay also be a direct relationship between shear Alfven waves and the auroral signatureswhich signify substorm onset. Numerical simulations and laboratory experiments havedemonstrated that shear Alfven waves of short perpendicular extent can support parallelelectric fields which accelerate electrons in collisionless plasma typical of magnetosphericconditions.

EMIC wave generation and associated loss of energetic particles during magnetospheric compressions.,M Usanova; IR Mann; IJ Rae; Z Kale; A Parent; V Angelopoulos; J Bonnell; K Glassmeier; U Auster; M Sandanger; F Soraas; H Singer,Abstract Electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves are believed to play an important rolein the dynamics of energetic particles in the inner magnetosphere; causing them toprecipitate into the ionosphere via resonant interaction. In order to incorporate the EMIC-related loss processes into global magnetospheric models one needs to know solar windand magnetospheric conditions favorable for EMIC wave excitation as well as localization ofthe waves in the magnetosphere. In this work; we investigate the role of magnetosphericcompression in the generation of EMIC waves in the inner magnetosphere.

Byadopting this approach only clear and single FLRs can be correctly analyzed.

Global modeling of Pc5 ULF Wave Activity and Relativistic Electron Dynamics following a Large Geomagnetic Storm,AW Degeling; R Rankin; GV Khazanov; IJ Rae,Abstract Ground-based observations during an interval of narrow-band ULF activityfollowing a geomagnetic storm on November 25; 2001 are used to constrain the temporaland spatial characteristics of waves produced by a global model for ULF waves in themagnetosphere. This event is characterized by a long interval of high solar wind speed; anda strong field line resonance (FLR) localized to the local dusk sector. Both Polar and Clustersatellite observations during the interval of interest indicate that MHD fast waves producedby the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability along the dusk magnetopause flank are the likely sourceof wave power for the FLR. Based on this interpretation; an anti-sunward propagating ULFwave source is prescribed along the magnetopause boundary of the ULF wave model.

During this time large-scaleoscillations were observed in both ground based and spacecraft data. A highlight of thesedata is the large-scale oscillations observed by all four Cluster spacecraft; which at this timeare separated by~ 10;000 km. We utilize these numerous measurements to examine thestructural evolution of the magnetopause boundary layer from the dayside round to the dawnflank; focusing on the large-and local-scale activity.

Substorm Timing and Location Using The Combined CARISMA and THEMIS GMAG Magnetometers,IJ Rae; DK Milling; IR Mann; KR Murphy; K Glassmeier; U Auster; V Angelopoulos; CT Russell,Abstract With the successful launch of the THEMIS spacecraft; the expansion of theCARISMA magnetometer array; and the deployment of the THEMIS GBOs; there now existsan exceptional opportunity to study fundamental ULF wave science in the nightsidemagnetosphere around substorm onset. Traditionally; substorm onset is usually determinedby location and timing of ULF waves in the Pi2 (40-200 second period) range. With thecurrent configuration of ground magnetometers; it is now possible to resolve frequencies inthe Pi1 (1-40 second period) band using novel techniques such as Wavelet Analysis. Withthis technique; the entire spectrum of ULF waves associated with substorm onset can beaccurately timed to approximately half of the wave period. We use a substorm locationmodeling algorithm [Cramoysan et al.; 1995] to produce initial estimates of the locations …,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,2007,*

Magnetospheric {ULF} Activity as a Function of Solar Wind Conditions: Toward a Quantitative Model of Radial Diffusion in the Magnetosphere,SR Elkington; C Huang; AA Chan; IR Mann; IJ Rae,Abstract Magnetospheric ULF waves; with frequencies in the mHz range; are known toefficiently energize and transport relativistic electrons in the radiation belts through resonantinteractions leading to enhanced rates of radial diffusion. However; the global occurrenceand physical characteristics of the waves driving the transport; and the resulting rates ofradial diffusion; are not well-characterized in terms of the solar wind conditions responsiblefor the ULF activity. In this effort we drive global MHD simulations of the magnetosphereusing an idealized set of solar wind conditions; based on statistical characterizations of thesolar wind pressure (and its variations) as a function of solar wind velocity. The simulatedULF wave distributions are analyzed as a function of radial position and global modestructure within the magnetosphere.

Observations of Mirror-Mode Structures in the Dawn-Side Magnetosphere,IJ Rae; IR Mann; CE Watt; LM Kistler,Abstract There are a number of mechanisms by which ULF oscillations can be excited in themagnetosphere; both externally (ie solar wind) or internally (eg via resonance with energeticparticle sources). One mechanism that is not traditionally considered/observed is the mirrorinstability/mode. The mirror mode is a fundamental plasma instability and described as acompressible slow mode typically excited in high-beta plasmas where there is significantpressure anisotropy and grows if the free energy of the pressure anisotropy is sufficientlylarge and must be dissipated. Observational evidence of these mirror modes are rare; butmainly concentrated in the dayside magnetosheath; where the necessary temperatureanisotropies can develop; and increase as the magnetopause is approached. However; it ispossible to generate the mirror instability inside the magnetosphere; though as yet there …,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,2005,*
Coordinated Observation of Field Line Resonance in the Mid-magnetotail,Y Zheng; AT Lui; IR Mann; K Takahashi; J Watermann; S Chen; IJ Rae; T Mukai; CT Russell; A Balogh; RF Pfaff; H Reme,Abstract Standing Alfven waves of 1.1 mHz were observed by the Cluster satellites in themid-Earth magnetotail (around~ 21 Re equatorial distance; 0200 MLT) during 0600-0700UT on August 8; 2003 while Cluster were situated in the central plasma sheet. Pulsationswith the same frequency were also observed at several ground stations near Cluster'sfootpoint. The standing wave properties were determined from the electric and magneticfield measurements of Cluster. Data from the ground magnetometers indicated a latitudinalamplitude and phase structure consistent with the driven field line resonance (FLR) at 1.1mHz. Simultaneously; quasi-periodic oscillations at different frequency were observed in thepost-midnight/early morning sector by GOES 12 (~ 8.7 Re); Polar (~ 11-14 Re) and Geotail(~ 9.8 Re) as well.

Pc5 ULF; energetic Oxygen Ion; and EMIC Wave-Particle Interactions During the Halloween 2003 Storm,IR Mann; IJ Rae; L Kistler; M Engebretson,Abstract We present observations of ULF wave-particle interactions from the 29th October2003; during the Halloween storms period. Pc5 ULF waves are observed with theCANOPUS (now CARISMA) magnetometer array; during a conjugate pass of the Clusterspacecraft. The CANOPUS magnetometers measure a discrete frequency global Pc5 wavein the 1300-1400 UT interval. At the same time; the O+ flux from the CODIF instrument onCluster shows a non-uniform response in anti-parrallel look directions; implying a non-uniform gyro-tropic particle response of the O+ to the ULF waves. During the same period;the FGM on Cluster shows strongly enhanced waves in the Pc1 band below the local O+gyrofrequency; which are unusually dominated by the compressional magnetic component.We discuss possible causal inter-relationships between the ULF waves; the observed O+ …,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,2005,*
Multi-point Characterization of ULF Wave Energy Transport in the Magnetosphere.,IJ Rae; IR Mann; EF Donovan; FR Fenrich; CE Watt; DK Milling; DM Wright; JA Wild; B Lavraud,Abstract There are a number of mechanisms by which global ULF oscillations can beproduced in the magnetosphere. For example; during fast solar wind speed events; flowinstabilities can drive surface waves on the magnetopause which in turn can drivecompressional waves into the magnetosphere. Alternately; oscillations in solar windparameters can also produce similar compressional oscillations. These compressionalwaves are a source of ULF wave activity throughout the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.We present event studies of global ULF wave oscillations whereby favourable radialalignment of spacecraft in the magnetosphere and conjugate measurements of field lineresonances (FLRs) in the ionosphere allow the tracking of ULF wave energy in the near-Earth environment.

Virtuallymonochromatic large amplitude highly-polarised pulsations were observed by theCANOPUS magnetometer chain at dusk for many hours; which we identify as being a fieldline resonance. Many radars of the SuperDARN HF network observed clear pulsations ofsimilar frequencies as these radars rotated into the dusk sector ionosphere. The pulsationsare observed in geosynchronous data at all local times. We analyse the solar wind data toverify the source of these oscillations.

The global ionospheric response to a southward IMF turning,E Borälv; IJ Rae; HJ Opgenoorth; E Donovan; V Besser; Y-K Tung,The space around Earth; confined in the terrestrial magnetosphere; is to some extentshielded from the Sun's solar wind plasma and magnetic field. During certain conditions;however; strong interaction can occur between the solar wind and the magnetosphere;resulting in magnetospheric activity of several forms; among which substorms and stormsare the most prominent. A general framework for how these processes work have beenoutlayed through the history of research; however; there still remain questions to beanswered. The most striking example regards the onset of substorms; where both the onsetcause and location in the magnetosphere/ionosphere are still debated. These are clearly noteasily solved problems; since a substorm is a global process; ideally requiring simultaneousmeasurements in the magnetotail and ionosphere.

Multi-instrument Observations of Dayside Transient Reconnection,JA Davies; TK Yeoman; IJ Rae; SE Milan; M Lester; KA McWilliams; M Lockwood,Abstract Observations from the EISCAT VHF incoherent scatter radar system in North-ernScandinavia during a run of the common programme CP-4; reveal a series of poleward-propagating F-region electron density enhancements in the pre-noon sector on 23November 1999. In conjunction with these density features detected by EISCAT; poleward-moving radar auroral forms (PMRAFs) are observed by the Hankasalmi (Finland) HFcoherent scatter radar of the SuperDARN chain. Such HF transients are also seen in thesouthern hemisphere Syowa East SuperDARN radar.

Joint ground/space observations of transient phenomena associated with the Polar cusp,Iain Jonathan Rae,This thesis concerns the study of solar wind entry into the near-Earth environment via theprocess of time-varying reconnection.

Control of ULF Wave Accessibility to the Inner Magnetosphere by the Convection of Plasma Density,AW Degeling; IJ Rae; CEJ Watt; QQ Shi; R Rankin; Q‐G Zong,Abstract During periods of storm activity and enhanced convection; the plasma density in theafternoon sector of the magnetosphere is highly dynamic due to the development ofplasmaspheric drainage plume (PDP) structure. This significantly affects the local AlfvÃľnspeed; and alters the propagation of ULF waves launched from the magnetopause.Therefore it can be expected that the accessibility of ULF wave power for radiation beltenergization is sensitively dependent on the recent history of magnetospheric convection;and the stage of development of the PDP. This is investigated using a 3D model for ULFwaves within the magnetosphere in which the plasma density distribution is evolved usingan advection model for cold plasma; driven by a (VollandâĂŞStern) convection electrostaticfield (resulting in PDP structure). The wave model includes magnetic-field day/night …,Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics,*,*

The interaction between shear Alfven waves and warm electrons in the Earth's magnetosphere,CEJ Watt; R Rankin; IJ Rae,Complete text of publication follows. Shear Alfven waves (SAW) are a wave mode with ultra-low frequencies (f< 30Hz) which propagate through the magnetosphere; carryinginformation and energy along the magnetic field between plasma regions. Magnetosphericand ground-based observations demonstrate that SAW are associated with auroralacceleration; field-line resonances and substorm expansion phase onset; although the wavegeneration mechanisms are not well understood. In this talk we will focus on the kineticphysics of shear Alfven waves and their resulting relationship with electrons in thecollisionless plasma of the Earth's magnetosphere. In auroral regions; SAW travel throughboth warm and cold plasma on their way from the magnetosphere towards the ionosphere;and their propagation characteristics are dependent upon the relationship between the …,*,*,*

Duringthis interval; we succesfully employ cross-phase analysis techniques to recreate discretepoints along the Alfvén continuum for the first time following the substorm expansion phaseonset. Using the complex demodulation analysis technique; we study the latitudinal andlongitudinal properties of the Pi2 pulsations in terms of amplitude; phase; ellipticity andpolarisation and demonstrate that the Pi2 pulsations have the characteristics of a driven fieldline resonance. These results allow us to answer a long-standing question in substormphysics; whether the frequency of the high-latitude Pi2 pulsation results from a directly-driven response to a magnetotail driver; or from the properties of the magnetospheric field …,*,*,*

This involvednearsimultaneous brightening of 1 MLT hour longitudinal segment of the onset arc. The partof the arc that brightened was that closest to the equatorward boundary of the diffuse(proton) aurora. Within one minute; a dipolarization front moved across four THEMISsatellites. Based on their locations; the order in which they detected the dipolarization front;and the auroral evolution; we assert that the expansion phase began earthward of the foursatellites and evolved radially outwards. We conclude that the onset occurred in anazimuthally localized region of highly stretched field lines.,*,*,*

Introduction The magnetopause is the interface between the solar wind plasma and themagnetospheric plasma. Its position is mainly determined by the equilibrium between themagnetic pressure on the magnetospheric side and the total plasma pressure on themagnetosheath side. Neglecting any thermal pressure of the solar wind; the magnetosheathpressure is proportional to the solar wind dynamic pressure. Observations of its variationshave been used to predict and explain the dynamic response of the magnetosphere.However; such comparisons are hampered by the fact that only solar wind observationswere available while the magnetosphere responds to magnetosheath variations.Interpolations taking into account travel time delays of the solar wind perturbations etc. arenecessary to accomplish dynamic response studies [eg Sibeck et al.; 1989; Matsuoka et …,*,*,*
