XPath lookup queries in P2P networks,Angela Bonifati; Ugo Matrangolo; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Mayank Jain,Abstract We address the problem of querying XML data over a P2P network. In P2Pnetworks; the allowed kinds of queries are usually exact-match queries over file names. Wediscuss the extensions needed to deal with XML data and XPath queries. A single peer canhold a whole document or a partial/complete fragment of the latter. Each XMLfragment/document is identified by a distinct path expression; which is encoded in adistributed hash table. Our framework differs from content-based routing mechanisms;biased towards finding the most relevant peers holding the data. We perform fragmentsplacement and enable fragments lookup by solely exploiting few path expressions stored oneach peer. By taking advantage of quasi-zero replication of global catalogs; our systemsupports fast full and partial XPath querying. To this purpose; we have extended the …,Proceedings of the 6th annual ACM international workshop on Web information and data management,2004,100

Edge betweenness centrality: A novel algorithm for QoS-based topology control over wireless sensor networks,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Alexis Papadimitriou; Dimitrios Katsaros; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract In this paper we propose a novel topology-control algorithm; called edgebetweenness centrality (EBC). EBC is based on the concept of betweenness centrality;which has been first introduced in the context of social network analysis (SNA); andmeasures the “importance” of each node in the network. This information allows us toachieve high quality of service (QoS) in wireless sensor networks by evaluatingrelationships between entities of the network (ie; edges); and hence identifying differentroles among them (eg; brokers; outliers); thus controlling information flow; message delivery;latency and energy dissipation among nodes. The experimental evaluation and analysis ofEBC in comparison to other state-of-the-art topology control algorithms shows that ouralgorithm outperforms the competitor ones in all observed cases.,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,2012,59

Discovering frequent patterns from uncertain data streams with time-fading and landmark models,Carson Kai-Sang Leung; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Fan Jiang,Abstract Streams of data can be continuously generated by sensors in various real-lifeapplications such as environment surveillance. Partially due to the inherited limitation of thesensors; data in these streams can be uncertain. To discover useful knowledge in the form offrequent patterns from streams of uncertain data; a few algorithms have been developed.They mostly use the sliding window model for processing and mining data streams.However; for some applications; other stream processing models such as the time-fadingmodel and the landmark model are more appropriate. In this paper; we propose miningalgorithms that use (i) the time-fading model and (ii) the landmark model to discover frequentpatterns from streams of uncertain data.,*,2013,55
Providing probabilistically-bounded approximate answers to non-holistic aggregate range queries in OLAP,Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Abstract A novel framework for providing probabilistically-bounded approximate answers tonon-holistic aggregate range queries in OLAP is presented in this paper. Such a frameworkallows us to efficiently support OLAP applications; as answering queries is the mainbottleneck for this kind of applications. To this end; scalability of the techniques andaccuracy of the answers are recognized as important limitations of state-of-the-artapproximate query answering proposals in OLAP. Specifically; this paper is focused on thelatter limitation; whereas it refers to results presented in [9] for the first one. The KSynsynopsis data structure; which implements the guidelines of the proposed framework andovercomes the recognized limitations; is also presented and discussed in detail; along witha query-conscious error metrics-based storage space allocation scheme. Finally …,Proceedings of the 8th ACM international workshop on Data warehousing and OLAP,2005,51
Balancing accuracy and privacy of OLAP aggregations on data cubes,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Domenico Saccà,Abstract In this paper we propose an innovative framework based on flexible sampling-based data cube compression techniques for computing privacy preserving OLAPaggregations on data cubes while allowing approximate answers to be efficiently evaluatedover such aggregations. In our proposal; this scenario is accomplished by means of the so-called accuracy/privacy contract; which determines how OLAP aggregations must beaccessed throughout balancing accuracy of approximate answers and privacy of sensitiveranges of multidimensional data.,Proceedings of the ACM 13th international workshop on Data warehousing and OLAP,2010,50
Mining constrained frequent itemsets from distributed uncertain data,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Carson Kai-Sang Leung; Richard Kyle MacKinnon,Abstract Nowadays; high volumes of massive data can be generated from various sources(eg; sensor data from environmental surveillance). Many existing distributed frequent itemsetmining algorithms do not allow users to express the itemsets to be mined according to theirintention via the use of constraints. Consequently; these unconstrained mining algorithmscan yield numerous itemsets that are not interesting to users. Moreover; due to inheritedmeasurement inaccuracies and/or network latencies; the data are often riddled withuncertainty. These call for both constrained mining and uncertain data mining. In this journalarticle; we propose a data-intensive computer system for tree-based mining of frequentitemsets that satisfy user-defined constraints from a distributed environment such as awireless sensor network of uncertain data.,Future Generation Computer Systems,2014,49
Overcoming limitations of approximate query answering in OLAP,Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Two important limitations of approximate query answering in OLAP are recognized andinvestigated. These limitations are:(i) scalability of the techniques; ie their reliability on highly-dimensional data cubes; and (ii) need for guarantees on the degree of approximation of theanswers. In this paper; we focus on the first limitation; and propose adopting the well-knownKarhunen-Loeve transform (KLT) to obtain dimensionality reduction of data cubes; thusdevising a transformation methodology that is independent by the number of dimensions ofthe data cubes. To tailor the KLT for the specific OLAP context; effective optimizations arealso proposed; by taking into account the query-consciousness feature. Finally; someencouraging preliminary experimental results are presented.,Database Engineering and Application Symposium; 2005. IDEAS 2005. 9th International,2005,47
A grid framework for approximate aggregate query answering on summarized sensor network readings,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Filippo Furfaro; Giuseppe M Mazzeo; Domenico Saccà,Abstract The problem of representing and querying sensor-network data issues newresearch challenges; as traditional techniques and architectures used for managingrelational and object oriented databases are not suitable in this context. In this paper wepresent a Grid-based architecture that supports aggregate query answering on sensornetwork data; and uses a summarization technique to efficiently accomplish this task. Inparticular; grid nodes are used either to collect; compress and store sensor readings; and toextract information from stored data. Grid nodes can exchange information among eachother; so that the same piece of information can be stored (with a different degree ofaccuracy) into several nodes. Queries are evaluated by locating the grid nodes containingthe needed information; and choosing (among these nodes) the most convenient ones …,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2004,46

Semantics-aware advanced OLAP visualization of multidimensional data cubes,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Domenico Sacca; Paolo Serafino,Abstract Efficiently supporting advanced OLAP visualization of multidimensional data cubesis a novel and challenging research topic; which results to be of interest for a large family ofdata warehouse applications relying on the management of spatio-temporal (eg; mobile)data; scientific and statistical data; sensor network data; biological data; etc. On the otherhand; the issue of visualizing multidimensional data domains has been quite neglected fromthe research community; since it does not belong to the well-founded conceptual-logical-physical design hierarchy inherited from relational database methodologies. Inspired fromthese considerations; in this article we propose an innovative advanced OLAP visualizationtechnique that meaningfully combines (i) the so-called OLAP dimension flattening process;which allows us to extract two-dimensional OLAP views from multidimensional data …,International Journal of Data Warehousing and Mining (IJDWM),2007,45
CAMS: OLAPing multidimensional data streams efficiently,Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Abstract In the context of data stream research; taming the multidimensionality of real-lifedata streams in order to efficiently support OLAP analysis/mining tasks is a critical challenge.Inspired by this fundamental motivation; in this paper we introduce CAMS (C ube-based Acquisition model for M ultidimensional S treams); a model for efficiently OLAPingmultidimensional data streams. CAMS combines a set of data stream processingmethodologies; namely (i) the OLAP dimension flattening process; which allows us to obtaindimensionality reduction of multidimensional data streams; and (ii) the OLAP streamaggregation scheme; which aggregates data stream readings according to an OLAP-hierarchy-based membership approach.

A robust sampling-based framework for privacy preserving OLAP,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Vincenzo Russo; Domenico Saccà,Abstract A robust sampling-based framework for privacy preserving OLAP is introduced andexperimentally assessed in this paper. The most distinctive characteristic of the proposedframework consists in adopting an innovative privacy OLAP notion; which deals with theproblem of preserving the privacy of OLAP aggregations rather than the one of data cubecells; like in conventional perturbation-based privacy preserving OLAP techniques. Thisresults in a greater theoretical soundness; and lower computational overheads due toprocessing massive-in-size data cubes. Also; the performance of our privacy preservingOLAP technique is compared with the one of the method Zero-Sum; the state-of-the-artprivacy preserving OLAP perturbation-based technique; under several perspectives ofanalysis. The derived experimental results confirm to us the benefits deriving from …,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2008,44

Hand-olap: a system for delivering olap services on handheld devices,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Filippo Furfaro; Domenico Saccà,The main drawbacks of handheld devices (small storage space; small size of the displayscreen; discontinuance of the connection to the WLAN; etc.) are often incompatible with theneed of querying and browsing information extracted from the enormous amount of datawhich are accessible through the network. In this application scenario; the issues ofcompression and summarization of data have a leading role: data in a lossy compressedformat can be transmitted more efficiently than original ones; and can be effectively stored inthe handheld devices (setting the compression ratio accordingly). In this paper we describea very effective compression technique for datacubes and the architecture of a system(based on this compression technique); called Hand-OLAP; which allows a handheld deviceto extract and browse compressed information coming from an OLAP server distributed …,Autonomous Decentralized Systems; 2003.

Efficient fragmentation of large XML documents,Angela Bonifati; Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Abstract Fragmentation techniques for XML data are gaining momentum within bothdistributed and centralized XML query engines and pose novel and unrecognizedchallenges to the community. Albeit not novel; and clearly inspired by the classical divide etimpera principle; fragmentation for XML trees has been proved successful in boosting thequerying performance; and in cutting down the memory requirements. However;fragmentation considered so far has been driven by semantics; ie built around querypredicates. In this paper; we propose a novel fragmentation technique that founds onstructural constraints of XML documents (size; tree-width; and tree-depth) and on special-purpose structure histograms able to meaningfully summarize XML documents. This allowsus to predict bounding intervals of structural properties of output (XML) fragments for …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2007,42
A hierarchy-driven compression technique for advanced OLAP visualization of multidimensional data cubes,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Domenico Saccà; Paolo Serafino,Abstract In this paper; we investigate the problem of visualizing multidimensional datacubes; and propose a novel technique for supporting advanced OLAP visualization of suchdata structures. Founding on very efficient data compression solutions for two-dimensionaldata domains; the proposed technique relies on the amenity of generating “semantics-aware” compressed representation of two-dimensional OLAP views extracted frommultidimensional data cubes via the so-called OLAP dimension flattening process. A wideset of experimental results conducted on several kind of synthetic two-dimensional OLAPviews clearly confirm the effectiveness and the efficiency of our technique; also incomparison with state-of-the-art proposals.,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2006,42
Approximate query answering on sensor network data streams,Filippo Furfaro AlfredoCuzzocrea; Elio Masciari; Domenico Saccà; Cristina Sirangelo,ABSTRACT Sensor networks represent a non traditional source of information; as readingsgenerated by sensors flow continuously; leading to an infinite stream of data. TraditionalDBMSs; which are based on an exact and detailed representation of information; are notsuitable in this context; as all the information carried by a data stream cannot be storedwithin a bounded storage space. Thus; compressing data (by possibly loosing less relevantinformation) and storing their compressed representation; rather than the original one;becomes mandatory. This approach aims to store as much information carried by the streamas possible; but makes it unfeasible to provide exact answers to queries on the streamcontent. However; exact answers to queries are often not necessary; as approximate onesusually suffice to get useful reports on the world monitored by the sensors. In this paper …,GeoSensor Networks,2004,42
Fragmenting very large XML data warehouses via k-means clustering algorithm,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Jerome Darmont; Hadj Mahboubi,XML data sources are gaining popularity in the context of Business Intelligence and On-LineAnalytical Processing (OLAP) applications; due to the amenities of XML in representing andmanaging complex and heterogeneous data. However; XML-native database systemscurrently suffer from limited performance; both in terms of volumes of manageable data andquery response time. Therefore; recent research efforts are focusing on horizontalfragmentation techniques; which are able to overcome the above limitations. However;classical fragmentation algorithms are not suitable to control the number of originatedfragments; which instead plays a critical role in data warehouses. In this paper; we proposethe use of the K-means clustering algorithm for effectively and efficiently supporting thefragmentation of very large XML data warehouses.

Approximate range–sum query answering on data cubes with probabilistic guarantees,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Wei Wang,Abstract Approximate range aggregate queries are one of the most frequent and usefulkinds of queries for Decision Support Systems (DSS); as they are widely used in many dataanalysis tasks. Traditionally; sampling-based techniques have been proposed to tackle thisproblem. However; their effectiveness degrade when the underlying data distribution isskewed. Another approach based on the outlier management can limit the effect of dataskews but fails to address other requirements of approximate range aggregate queries; suchas error guarantees and query processing efficiency. In this paper; we present a techniquethat provides approximate answers to range aggregate queries on OLAP data cubesefficiently; with theoretical guarantees on the errors. Our basic idea is to build different datastructures to manage outliers and the rest of the data. Carefully chosen outliers are …,Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,2007,41
Event-based lossy compression for effective and efficient OLAP over data streams,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Sharma Chakravarthy,Abstract An innovative event-based lossy compression model for effective and efficientOLAP over data streams; called ECM-DS; is presented and experimentally assessed in thispaper. The main novelty of our compression approach with respect to traditional data streamcompression techniques relies on exploiting the semantics of the reference applicationscenario in order to drive the compression process by means of the “degree ofinterestingness” of events occurring in the target stream. This finally improves the quality ofretrieved approximate answers to OLAP queries over data streams; and; in turn; the qualityof complex knowledge discovery tasks over data streams developed on top of ECM-DS; andimplemented via ad-hoc data stream mining algorithms. Overall; the compression strategywe propose in this research puts the basis for a novel class of intelligent applications over …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2010,40

To overcome this relevant research challenge; in this paper we proposeLCS-Hist; an innovative multidimensional histogram devising a complex methodology thatcombines intelligent data modeling and processing techniques in order to tame theannoying problem of compressing massive high-dimensional data cubes.

Basically; this problem consists in visualizing multidimensional data sets bycapturing the dimensionality of data; which is the most difficult aspect to be considered.Human analysts interacting with high-dimensional data often experience disorientation andcognitive overload.

A distributed system for answering range queries on sensor network data,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Filippo Furfaro; Sergio Greco; Elio Masciari; Giuseppe M Mazzeo; Domenico Sacca,A distributed system for approximate query answering on sensor network data is proposed;where a suitable compression technique is exploited to represent data and support queryanswering. Each node of the system stores either detailed or summarized sensor readings.Query answers are computed by identifying the set of nodes that contain (either compressedor not) data involved in the query; and eventually partitioning the query in a set of sub-queries to be evaluated at different nodes. Queries are partitioned according to a cost modelaiming at making the evaluation efficient and guaranteeing the desired degree of accuracyof query answers.,Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops; 2005.

We introduce a multidimensional approach to model different aspects of the adaptationprocess; which is based on three different" adaptivity dimensions": user's behavior(preferences and browsing activity); technology (network and user's terminal) and externalenvironment (time; location; language; socio-political issues; etc.). An Adaptive Hypermediais modeled with respect to such dimensions; and a view over it corresponds to eachpotential position of the user in the" adaptation space". Finally; we propose a probabilisticalgorithm for the classification of users.,Proceedings of the 14th international conference on Software engineering and knowledge engineering,2002,40
Storing and retrieving XPath fragments in structured P2P networks,Angela Bonifati; Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Abstract In this paper; we address the problem of storing and retrieving XML data overstructured Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. These are becoming popular because of theiraccess efficiency. An open problem with such networks is represented by the kinds ofqueries they can handle. In fact; file name lookups; used in popular unstructured networks;are not suitable for many new data formats. Keyword-based searches are also notappropriate for XML data; which must be identified by the whole path leading to an element;rather than by the sole element name. We discuss the extensions needed to properly identifyXML data in structured P2P networks. A global document is split into various fragments;which are locally stored within the peers according to their own themes. Each fragment isenhanced with a set of few lightweight path expressions that have the convenient side …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2006,39
Improving range-sum query evaluation on data cubes via polynomial approximation,Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Abstract Inefficient query answering is the main drawback in Decision Support Systems(DSS); due to the very large size of the multidimensional data stored in the underlying DataWarehouse Server (DWS). Aggregate queries are the most frequent and useful kind for suchsystems; as they support several analysis based on the multidimensionality and multi-resolution of data. As a consequence; providing fast answers to aggregate queries (bytrading off accuracy for efficiency; if possible) has become a very important requirement inimproving the effectiveness of DSS-based applications. In this paper we present a techniquebased on an analytical interpretation of multidimensional data and on the well-known leastsquares approximation (LSA) method for supporting approximate aggregate queryanswering in OLAP; which represents the most common application interfaces for a DWS …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2006,39
Analytical synopses for approximate query answering in OLAP environments,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Ugo Matrangolo,Abstract In this paper we present a technique based on an analytical interpretation of multi-dimensional data and on the well-known Least Squares Approximation (LSA) method forsupporting approximate aggregate query answering in OLAP environments; the mostcommon application interfaces for a Data Warehouse Server (DWS). Our technique consistsin building data synopses by interpreting the original data distribution as a set of discretefunctions. These synopses; called Δ-Syn; are obtained by approximating data with a set ofpolynomial coefficients; and storing these coefficients instead of the original data. Queriesare issued on the compressed representation; thus reducing the number of disk accessesneeded to evaluate the answer. We also provide some experimental results on several kindsof synthetic OLAP data cubes.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2004,37

This work presents an Application Domain model for Adaptive HypermediaSystems and an architecture for its support. For the description of the high-level structure ofthe application domain we propose an object-oriented model based on the class diagramsof the Unified Modeling Language; extended with (i) a graph-based formalism for capturingnavigational properties of the hypermedia and (ii) a logic-based formalism for expressingfurther semantic properties of the domain. The model makes use of XML for the descriptionof metadata about basic information fragments and “neutral” pages to be adapted.

Community detection in multi-relational social networks,Zhiang Wu; Wenpeng Yin; Jie Cao; Guandong Xu; Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Abstract Multi-relational networks are ubiquitous in many fields such as bibliography; twitter;and healthcare. There have been many studies in the literature targeting at discoveringcommunities from social networks. However; most of them have focused on single-relationalnetworks. A hint of methods detected communities from multi-relational networks byconverting them to single-relational networks first. Nevertheless; they commonly assumeddifferent relations were independent from each other; which is obviously unreal to real-lifecases. In this paper; we attempt to address this challenge by introducing a novel co-rankingframework; named MutuRank. It makes full use of the mutual influence between relationsand actors to transform the multi-relational network to the single-relational network.

On improvement of cloud virtual machine availability with virtualization fault tolerance mechanism,Chao-Tung Yang; Jung-Chun Liu; Ching-Hsien Hsu; Wei-Li Chou,Abstract Virtualization; particularly in the field of cloud computing; is a common strategy toimprove existing computing resources. Hadoop; one of the Apache projects; is designed toscale up from single servers to thousands of machines; each offering local computation andstorage capabilities. However; how to guarantee both stability and reliability of virtualizationhave become important topics. In this article; to reach this goal we used current open-sourcesoftware and platforms; for instance; the Xen-Hypervisor virtualization technology; and theOpenNebula virtual machines management tool. After extending components capabilities;we developed a mechanism to support our ideas and reached high availability with Hadoopthat is also called as virtualization fault tolerance (VFT).

In DW and BI systems;decision making analysts aim at avoiding that malicious users access perceptive ranges ofmultidimensional data in order to infer sensitive knowledge; or attack corporate data cubesvia violating user rules; grants and revokes. In DM tools; domain experts aim at avoiding thatmalicious users infer critical-for-thetask knowledge from authoritative DM results such asfrequent item sets; patterns and regularities; clusters; and discovered association rules. Inmore detail; the former application scenario (ie; DW and BI systems) deals with both theprivacy preservation and the security of data cubes; whereas the latter one (ie; DM tools) …,*,2009,20

Privacy preserving olap over distributed xml data: A theoretically-sound secure-multiparty-computation approach,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Privacy Preserving Distributed OLAP is becoming a critical challenge for next-generation Business Intelligence (BI) scenarios; due to the “natural suitability” of OLAP inanalyzing distributed massive BI repositories in a multidimensional and multi-granularitymanner. In particular; in these scenarios XML-formatted BI repositories play a dominant role;due to the well-know amenities of XML in modeling and representing distributed businessdata. However; while Privacy Preserving Distributed Data Mining has been widelyinvestigated; the problem of effectively and efficiently supporting privacy preserving OLAPover distributed collections of XML documents; which is relevant in practice; has beenneglected so far. In order to fulfill this gap; we propose a novel Secure MultipartyComputation (SMC)-based privacy preserving OLAP framework for distributed collections …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2011,17
\mathcal {F} &\mathcal {A}: A Methodology for Effectively and Efficiently Designing Parallel Relational Data Warehouses on Heterogenous Database Clusters,Ladjel Bellatreche; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Soumia Benkrid,Abstract In this paper we propose a comprehensive methodology for designing ParallelRelational Data Warehouses (PRDW) over database clusters; called F ragmentation & Allocation (F & A). F & A assumes that cluster nodes are heterogeneous in processing powerand storage capacity; contrary to traditional design approaches that assume that clusternodes are instead homogeneous; and fragmentation and allocation phases are performedin a simultaneous manner; contrary to traditional design approaches that instead performthese phases in an isolated manner. Also; a naive replication algorithm that takes intoaccount the heterogeneous characteristics of our reference architecture is proposed. Finally;our proposal is experimentally assessed and validated against the widely-known datawarehouse benchmark APB-1 release II.,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2010,16
A novel distributed framework for optimizing query routing trees in wireless sensor networks via optimal operator placement,Georgios Chatzimilioudis; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Nikos Mamoulis,Abstract In this paper; we focus the attention on the operator placement problem in WirelessSensor Networks (WSN). This problem is very relevant for in-network query processing overWSN; where query routing trees are decomposed into three sub-components that must beprocessed at query time; namely operator tree; operator placement assignment scheme androuting scheme. In particular; the operator placement assignment defines on which node ofthe network each (query) operator will be hosted and executed. Hence; operator placementplays a key role in the context of query optimization issues in WSN research. In line with thismain motivation; in this paper we present an optimal distributed algorithm to adapt theplacement of a single operator in high communication cost networks; such as a wirelesssensor network. Our parameter-free algorithm finds the optimal node to host the operator …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2013,15
Discovering semantic Web services via advanced graph-based matching,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Marco Fisichella,One of the main advantages of Web services is that they can be composed into morecomplex processes in order to achieve a given business goal. However; such potentialitycannot be fully exploited until suitable methods and techniques allowing us to enableautomatic discovery of composed processes are provided. Indeed; nowadays servicediscovery still focuses on matching atomic services by typically checking the similarity offunctional parameters; such as inputs and outputs. However; a more profitable processdiscovering can be reached if both internal structure and component services are taken intoaccount. Based on this main intuition; in this paper we describe a method for discoveringcomposite OWL-S processes that founds on the following main contributions:(i) proposing agraph-based representation of composite OWL-S processes; and (ii) introducing an …,Systems; Man; and Cybernetics (SMC); 2011 IEEE International Conference on,2011,15

Detecting health events on the social web to enable epidemic intelligence,Marco Fisichella; Avaré Stewart; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Kerstin Denecke,Abstract Content analysis and clustering of natural language documents becomes crucial invarious domains; even in public health. Recent pandemics such as Swine Flu have causedconcern for public health officials. Given the ever increasing pace at which infectiousdiseases can spread globally; officials must be prepared to react sooner and with greaterepidemic intelligence gathering capabilities. Information should be gathered from a broaderrange of sources; including the Web which in turn requires more robust processingcapabilities. To address this limitation; in this paper; we propose a new approach to detectpublic health events in an unsupervised manner. We address the problems associated withadapting an unsupervised learner to the medical domain and in doing so; propose anapproach which combines aspects from different feature-based event detection methods …,International Symposium on String Processing and Information Retrieval,2011,14

Adaptive stream clustering using incremental graph maintenance,Marwan Hassani; Pascal Spaus; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Challenges for clustering streaming data are getting continuously moresophisticated. This trend is driven by the the emerging requirements of the application wherethose algorithms are used and the properties of the stream itself. Some of these propertiesare the continuous data arrival; the time-critical processing of objects; the evolution of thedata streams; the presence of outliers and the varying densities of the data. Due to the factthat the stream evolves continuously in the process of its existence; it is crucial that thealgorithm autonomously detects clusters of arbitrary shape; with different densities; andvarying number of clusters. Recently; the first hierarchical density-based stream clusteringalgorithm based on cluster stability; called HASTREAM; was proposed. Although thealgorithm was able to meet the above mentioned requirements; it inherited the main …,Workshop on Big Data; Streams and Heterogeneous Source Mining: Algorithms; Systems; Programming Models and Applications,2015,12
Effectively and efficiently designing and querying parallel relational data warehouses on heterogeneous database clusters: The f&a approach,Ladjel Bellatreche; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Soumia Benkrid,Abstract In this paper; a comprehensive methodology for designing and querying ParallelRational Data Warehouses (PRDW) over database clusters; called Fragmentation &Allocation (F&A) is proposed. F&A assumes that cluster nodes are heterogeneous inprocessing power and storage capacity; contrary to traditional design approaches thatassume that cluster nodes are instead homogeneous; and fragmentation and allocationphases are performed in a simultaneous manner. In classical approaches; two different costmodels are used to perform fragmentation and allocation; separately; whereas F&A makesuse of one cost model that considers fragmentation and allocation parameterssimultaneously. Therefore; according to the F&A methodology proposed; the allocationphase/decision is done at fragmentation. At the fragmentation phase; F&A uses two well …,Journal of Database Management (JDM),2012,12
Data de-duplication: a review,Gianni Costa; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Giuseppe Manco; Riccardo Ortale,Abstract The wide exploitation of new techniques and systems for generating; collecting andstoring data has made available growing volumes of information. Large quantities of suchinformation are stored as free texts. The lack of explicit structure in free text is a major issuein the categorization of such kind of data for more effective and efficient information retrieval;search and filtering. The abundance of structured data is problematic too. Several databasesare available; that contain data of the same type. Unfortunately; they often conform todifferent schemas; which avoids the unified management of even structured information.

The proposed model andthe supporting architecture allow the hypermedia adaptation along three different “adaptivitydimensions”: user's behaviour (preferences and browsing activity); technology (network;user's terminal; etc.); external environment (time; location; language; socio-political issues;etc.). A view over the Application Domain corresponds to each possible position of the userin the “adaptation space”. For the description of the logical structure of the hypermedia wepropose a graph-based layered model: XML-based models are used to describe metadataabout basic data fragments and “neutral” pages to be adapted (ie presented) with respect tothe user position.

Mining frequent itemsets from sparse data streams in limited memory environments,Juan J Cameron; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Fan Jiang; Carson K Leung,Abstract Floods of data can be produced in many applications such as Web click streams orwireless sensor networks. Hence; algorithms for mining frequent itemsets from data streamsare in demand. Many existing stream mining algorithms capture important streaming dataand assume that the captured data can fit into main memory. However; problem arose whenthe available memory so limited that such an assumption does not hold. In this paper; wepresent a data structure called DSTable to capture important data from the streams onto thedisk. The DSTable can be easily maintained and is applicable for mining frequent itemsetsfrom streams (especially sparse data) in limited memory environments.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2013,11

Effectively and efficiently supporting roll-up and drill-down OLAP operations over continuous dimensions via hierarchical clustering,Michelangelo Ceci; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Donato Malerba,Abstract In traditional OLAP systems; roll-up and drill-down operations over data cubesexploit fixed hierarchies defined on discrete attributes; which play the roles of dimensions;and operate along them. New emerging application scenarios; such as sensor networks;have stimulated research on OLAP systems; where even continuous attributes areconsidered as dimensions of analysis; and hierarchies are defined over continuousdomains. The goal is to avoid the prior definition of an ad-hoc discretization hierarchy alongeach OLAP dimension.

Verification of partitioning and allocation techniques on teradata DBMS,Ladjel Bellatreche; Soumia Benkrid; Ahmad Ghazal; Alain Crolotte; Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Abstract Data fragmentation and allocation in distributed and parallel DatabaseManagement Systems (DBMS) have been extensively studied in the past. Previous worktackled these two problems separately even though they are dependent on each other. Werecently developed a combined algorithm that handles the dependency issue betweenfragmentation and allocation. A novel genetic solution was developed for this problem. Themain issue of this solution and previous solutions is the lack of real life verifications of thesemodels.

Our approach fallsin the broader discipline of graph structural mining; and exploits a leading concept initiallystudied in the context of Social Network Analysis (SNA); namely betweenness. Particularly;in our research betweenness is applied in terms of a graph structural mining measureembedded in the core layer of our proposed topology control algorithm; called EdgeBetweenness Centrality (EBC). EBC allows us to evaluate relationships between entities ofthe network (eg; nodes; edges); and hence identify different roles among them (eg; brokers;outliers). In turn; deriving knowledge is further exploited to define raking operators that lookat structural properties of the graph modeling the target sensor network.

Olap over continuous domains via density-based hierarchical clustering,Michelangelo Ceci; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Donato Malerba,Abstract In traditional OLAP systems; roll-up and drill-down operations over data cubesexploit fixed hierarchies defined on discrete attributes that play the roles of dimensions; andoperate along them. However; in recent years; a new tendency of considering evencontinuous attributes as dimensions; hence hierarchical members become continuousaccordingly; has emerged mostly due to novel and emerging application scenarios likesensor and data stream management tools. A clear advantage of this emerging approach isthat of avoiding the beforehand definition of an ad-hoc discretization hierarchy along eachOLAP dimension.

Knowledge discovery from geo-located tweets for supporting advanced big data analytics: A real-life experience,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Giuseppe Psaila; Maurizio Toccu,Abstract Tourists are an important asset for the economy of the regions they visit. Theanswer to the question “where do tourists actually go?” could be really useful for publicadministrators and local governments. In particular; they need to understand what touristsactually visit; where they actually spend nights; and so on and so forth. In this paper; weintroduce an original approach that exploits geo-located messages posted by Twitter usersthrough their smartphones when they travel. Tools developed within the FollowMe suitetrack movements of Twitter users that post tweets in an airport and reconstruct their tripswithin an observed area. To illustrate the potentiality of our method; we present a simplecase study in which trips are traced on the map (through KML layers shown in Google Earth)based on different analysis dimensions.,*,2015,7
Frequent subgraph mining from streams of linked graph structured data,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Fan Jiang; Carson K Leung,Nowadays; high volumes of high-value data (eg; semantic web data) can be generated andpublished at a high velocity. A collection of these data can be viewed as a big; interlinked;dynamic graph structure of linked resources. Embedded in them are implicit; previouslyunknown; and potentially useful knowledge. Hence; ecient knowledge discovery algorithmsfor mining frequent subgraphs from these dynamic; streaming graph structured data are indemand.

Efficient frequent itemset mining from dense data streams,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Fan Jiang; Wookey Lee; Carson K Leung,Abstract Due to advances in technology; high volumes of valuable data can be produced athigh velocity in many real-life applications. Hence; efficient data mining techniques fordiscovering implicit; previously unknown; and potentially useful frequent itemsets from datastreams are in demand. Many existing stream mining algorithms capture important streamdata and assume that the captured data can fit into main memory. However; problems arisewhen the available memory is so limited that such an assumption does not hold. In thispaper; we present a data structure to capture important data from the streams onto the disk.In addition; we present two algorithms—which use this data structure—to mine frequentitemsets from these dense (or sparse) data streams.,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2014,7
Processing and mining complex data streams,Jerzy Stefanowski; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Dominik Slezak,Data mining aims at discovering valid; novel and potentially useful patterns from data. Overlast two decades; data mining and the related; older discipline of machine learning haveshown tremendous progress and become ones of the main sub-fields of computer science.Novel research problems have been identified; many innovative methods have beenintroduced and the number of their applications in various areas has been increasingrelevantly. As a result; both data mining and machine learning have become powerful toolsfor many areas; such as medicine; biology; economy; finance; social sciences and others.Nevertheless; many of current approaches assume processing static and simple (usuallytabular) of data. Such kinds of data occur in most of popular software systems and they aretypically easy to obtain from relational databases. However; this data model appears to …,Information Sciences,2014,7

The algorithm makes use ofa specialized data structure; called DiSE-tree; for effectively and efficiently representingrelevant information on diverse social entities while successfully supporting the miningphase. Diverse entities are popular in a wide spectrum of application scenarios; rangingfrom linked Web data to Semantic Web and social networks. In all these applicationscenarios; it has become important to analyze high volumes of valuable linked data anddiscover those diverse social entities.

An information-theoretic approach for setting the optimal number of decision trees in random forests,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Shane Leo Francis; Mohamed Medhat Gaber,Data Classification is a process within the Data Mining and Machine Learning field whichaims at annotating all instances of a dataset by so-called class labels. This involves increating a model from a training set of data instances which are already labeled; possiblybeing this model also used to define the class of data instances which are not classifiedalready. A successful way of performing the classification process is provided by thealgorithm Random Forests (RF); which is itself a type of Ensemble-based Classifier. Anensemble-based classifier increases the accuracy of the class label assigned to a datainstance by using a set of classifiers that are modeled on different; but possibly overlapping;instance sets; and then combining the so-obtained intermediate classification results. To thisend; RF particularly makes use of a number of decision trees to classify an instance; then …,Systems; Man; and Cybernetics (SMC); 2013 IEEE International Conference on,2013,7

CAD: an efficient data management and migration scheme across clouds for data-intensive scientific applications,Ching-Hsien Hsu; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Shih-Chang Chen,Abstract Data management and migration are important research challenges of novel Cloudenvironments. While moving data among different geographical domains; it is important tolower the transmission cost for performance purposes. Efficient scheduling methods allow usto manage data transmissions with lower number of steps and shorter transmission time. Inprevious research efforts; several methods have been proposed in literature in order tomanage data and minimize transmission cost for the case of Single Cluster environments.Unfortunately; these methods are not suitable to large-scale and complicated environmentssuch as Clouds; with particular regard to the case of scheduling policies. Starting from thesemotivations; in this paper we propose an efficient data transmission method for data-intensive scientific applications over Clouds; called Cloud Adaptive Dispatching (CAD) …,International Conference on Data Management in Grid and P2P Systems,2011,7
Graph-based matching of composite OWL-S services,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Juri Luca De Coi; Marco Fisichella; Dimitrios Skoutas,Abstract Existing techniques for Web service discovery focus mainly on matching functionalparameters of atomic services; such as inputs and outputs. However; one of the mainadvantages of Web services is that they are often composed into more complex processes toachieve a given goal. Applying such techniques in these cases; ignores the workflowstructure of the composite process; and therefore may produce matches that are not veryaccurate. To overcome this limitation; we propose in this paper a graph-based method formatching composite services; that are semantically described as OWL-S processes. Wepropose a graph representation of composite OWL-S processes and we introduce amatching algorithm that performs comparisons not only at the level of individual componentsbut also at the structural level; taking into consideration the control flow among the atomic …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2011,7
Query optimization over parallel relational data warehouses in distributed environments by simultaneous fragmentation and allocation,Ladjel Bellatreche; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Soumia Benkrid,Abstract Parallel database technology has already shown its efficiency in supporting high-performance Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) applications. This scenario impliesachieving query optimization over relational Data Warehouses (RDW) on top of whichtypical OLAP functionalities; such as roll-up; drill-down and aggregate query answering; canbe implemented. As a result; it follows the emerging need for a comprehensive methodologyable to support the design of RDW over parallel and distributed environments in all thephases; including data partitioning; fragment allocation; and data replication. Existing designapproaches have an important limitation: fragmentation and allocation phases areperformed in an isolated manner. In order to overcome this limitation; in this paper wepropose a new methodology for designing parallel RDW over distributed environments …,International Conference on Algorithms and Architectures for Parallel Processing,2010,7
Cubing algorithms for XML data,Alfredo Cuzzocrea,The problem of effectively and efficiently building OLAP data cubes over XML data sourcesis prominent in next-generation Enterprise Information Systems. The latter is the goal of so-called cubing algorithms; which have attracted a great deal of attention from the Databaseand Data Warehousing research community. On the basis of this breaking evidence; in thispaper we provide a comprehensive survey on cubing algorithms for XML data; along with acritical analysis of these algorithms; and discussion on open issues and future researchtrends in XML-OLAP research.,Database and Expert Systems Application; 2009.

Synopsis data structures for xml databases: Models; issues; and research perspectives,Angela Bonifati; Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Due to the lack of efficient native XML database management systems; XML datamanipulation and query evaluation may be resource-consuming; and represent a bottleneckfor several computationally intensive applications. To overcome the above limitations; apossible solution consists in computing synopsis data structures from XML databases; iecompressed representations providing a" succinct" description of the original databaseswhile ensuring low computational overhead and high accuracy for many XML processingtasks. Specifically; these data structures are very useful for both selectivity estimation andapproximate query answering purposes. On the other hand; while synopsis data structureshave been widely applied to relational as well as multidimensional data; a full usage forXML data is still lacking. Inspired by these considerations; in this paper we discuss the …,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 2007. DEXA'07. 18th International Workshop on,2007,7
Fragmenting XML Documents via Structural Constraints.,Angela Bonifati; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Bruno Zinno,Abstract. XML query processors suffer from main-memory limitations that pre-vent them fromprocessing large XML documents. While content-based predi-cates can be used to projectdown parts of the documents; it may still be needed to resize the obtained projectionsaccording to structural constraints. In this paper; we consider size; tree-width and tree-depthconstraints to enable a structuredriven fragmentation of XML documents. Although a set ofheuristics performing this kind of fragmentation can be easily devised; a key problem isdetermining the values of structural constraints input to the above heuristics; given that thesearch space is prohibitive at large. To alle-viate the problem; we introduce special-purposestructure histograms that report the constraint values for the fragments of a given document.We then present a prediction algorithm that probes those histograms to output the …,ADBIS Research Communications,2006,7
Answering approximate range aggregate queries on OLAP data cubes with Probabilistic Guarantees,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Wei Wang; Ugo Matrangolo,Abstract Approximate range aggregate queries are one of the most frequent and usefulkinds of queries for Decision Support Systems (DSS). Traditionally; sampling-basedtechniques have been proposed to tackle this problem. However; its effectiveness willdegrade when the underlying data distribution is skewed. Another approach based on theoutlier management can limit the effect of data skew but fails to address other requirementsof approximate range aggregate queries; such as error guarantees and query processingefficiency. In this paper; we present a technique that provide approximate answers to rangeaggregate queries on OLAP data cubes efficiently with theoretical error guarantees. Ourbasic idea is to build different data structures for outliers and the rest of the data.Experimental results verified the effectiveness of our proposed methods.,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2004,7

Towards OLAP analysis of multidimensional tweet streams,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Carmen De Maio; Giuseppe Fenza; Vincenzo Loia; Mimmo Parente,Abstract Social media and networks are used by millions of people to share with their friendsacross the world: tastes; opinions; ideas; etc. The volume and the speed at which these dataare produced make it a challenging task to discover meaningful patterns in the data.Nevertheless; very interesting business goals could be achieved collecting these data andperforming analytics on social media data streams; such as: addressing marketingstrategies; targeting advertisements; and so forth. We emphasize that there is a need toinvestigate and define suitable knowledge mining approaches to go beyond explicitlyavailable metadata by analyzing unstructured data to provide intelligent analytics services.Specifically; in this paper we provide first results on applying OLAP analysis tomultidimensional Tweet streams.,Proceedings of the ACM Eighteenth International Workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP,2015,6
Frequent pattern mining from dense graph streams,Juan J Cameron; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Fan Jiang; Carson K Leung,As technology advances; streams of data can be produced in many applications such associal networks; sensor networks; bioinformatics; and chemical informatics. These kinds ofstreaming data share a property in common--namely; they can be modeled in terms of graph-structured data. Here; the data streams generated by graph data sources in theseapplications are graph streams. To extract implicit; previously unknown; and potentiallyuseful frequent patterns from these streams; efficient data mining algorithms are in demand.Many existing algorithms capture important streaming data and assume that the captureddata can fit into main memory. However; problems arise when such an assumption does nothold (eg; when the available memory is limited).

Exploiting compression and approximation paradigms for effective and efficient online analytical processing over sensor network readings in data grid environments,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Domenico Saccà,SUMMARY Aggregate queries are useful tools in the context of sensor network-basedsystems as they retrieve knowledge from huge amounts of summarized readings to beexploited for knowledge discovery purposes. Actually; data representation and querymodels are problematic issues for managing sensor network data; because streamsproduced by sensors are theoretically unbounded. In this paper; we present a Gridframework; called SensorGrid; on the basis of data compression and approximationparadigms; which allows us to provide approximate answers to aggregate queries onsummarized sensor network data.

Horizontal partitioning of very-large data warehouses under dynamically-changing query workloads via incremental algorithms,Ladjel Bellatreche; Rima Bouchakri; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Sofian Maabout,Abstract With the explosion of the size of data warehousing applications; the horizontal datapartitioning is well adapted to reduce the cost of complex OLAP queries and the warehousemanageability. It is considered as a non redundant optimization technique. Selecting afragmentation schema for a given data warehouse is NP-hard problem. Several studies existand propose heuristics to select near optimal solutions. Most of these heuristics are static;since they assume the existence of a priori known set of queries. Note that in real lifeapplications; queries may change dynamically and fragmentation heuristics need tointegrate these changes. In this paper; we propose an incremental selection offragmentation schemes using on genetic algorithms. Intensive experiments are conducted tovalidate our proposal.,Proceedings of the 28th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2013,6
An effective and efficient parallel approach for random graph generation over GPUs,Stéphane Bressan; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Panagiotis Karras; Xuesong Lu; Sadegh Heyrani Nobari,Abstract The widespread usage of random graphs has been highlighted in the context ofdatabase applications for several years. This because such data structures turn out to bevery useful in a large family of database applications ranging from simulation to sampling;from analysis of complex networks to study of randomized algorithms; and so forth. Amongstothers; Erdős–Rényi Γ v; p is the most popular model to obtain and manipulate randomgraphs. Unfortunately; it has been demonstrated that classical algorithms for generatingErdős–Rényi based random graphs do not scale well in large instances and; in addition tothis; fail to make use of the parallel processing capabilities of modern hardware.

Distributed mining of constrained frequent sets from uncertain data,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Carson K Leung,Abstract With the advance in technology; sensor networks have been widely used in manyapplication areas such as environmental surveillance. Sensors distributed in these networksserve as good sources for data. This calls for distributed data mining; which searches forimplicit; previously unknown; and potentially useful patterns that might be embedded in thedistributed data. Many existing distributed data mining algorithms do not allow users toexpress the patterns to be mined according to their intention via the use of constraints.Consequently; these unconstrained mining algorithms can yield numerous patterns that arenot interesting to users. Moreover; due to inherited measurement inaccuracies and/ornetwork latencies; the data are often riddled with uncertainty. These call for constrainedmining and uncertain data mining.

Our experimentation focuses on two main classes of aggregaterange queries over sensor readings; namely (i) the window queries; which apply a SQLaggregation operator over a fixed window over the reading stream produced by the sensornetwork; and (ii) the continuous queries; which instead consider a “moving” window; andproduce as output a stream of answers.

Detecting overlapping communities in poly-relational networks,Zhiang Wu; Jie Cao; Guixiang Zhu; Wenpeng Yin; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Jin Shi,Abstract Discovering communities can promote the understanding of the structure; functionand evolution in various systems. Overlapping community detection in poly-relationalnetworks has gained much more interests in recent years; due to the fact that poly-relationalnetworks and communities with pervasive overlap are prevalent in the real world. A plethoraof methods detect communities from the poly-relational network by converting it to mono-relational networks first. Nevertheless; they commonly assume different relations areindependent from each other; which is obviously unreal to real-life cases. In this paper; weattempt to relax this strong assumption by introducing a novel co-ranking framework; namedMutuRank. It makes full use of the mutual influence between relations and actors totransform the poly-relational network to the mono-relational network. We then present a …,World Wide Web,2015,5

Tosearch and retrieve useful information from these linked data; users often enter queries intoinformation retrieval (IR) systems. Among the information retrieved by these systems; someinformation is relevant to the user queries (ie; Interested to the users); but some is not.Moreover; some relevant information may not be retrieved by the systems. The effectivenessof these IR systems is often measured by metrics such as precision and recall. Most of theconventional IR systems (eg; For web searches) aim to achieve high precision (ie; Highpercentage of the retrieved information is relevant) at the price of low recall (ie; Lowpercentage of the relevant information is retrieved).

In thecurrent era of big data; many traditional data management and analytic approaches may notbe suitable for handling the big data due to their well-known 5V's characteristics. Over thepast few years; several systems and applications have developed to use cluster; cloud orgrid computing to manage and analyze big data so as to support data science (eg;knowledge discovery and data mining). In this paper; we present a knowledge-basedsystem for social network analysis so as to support big data mining of interesting patternsfrom big social networks that are represented as graphs.,Procedia Computer Science,2016,4
Temporal aspects of big data management: state-of-the-art analysis and future research directions,Alfredo Cuzzocrea,A great deal of research efforts has been invested in temporal aspects of big datamanagement during last years; with alternate fortune. This line of research aims at capturing;formally modeling and successfully exploiting all the time-dependent characteristics of thefundamental big data model ranging from state model to query model. Temporal big datamanagement thus poses novel research challenges and exciting directions to be followed;and a first critical result is represented by recognizing that traditional time-focused models;techniques and algorithms developed in previous years are not suitable to deal with novelcharacteristics of big data; mainly due to volume; heterogeneity and scalability issues.Inspired by these considerations; in this paper we provide a comprehensive overview ofstate-of-the-art temporal big data management proposals; and criticisms on benefits and …,Temporal Representation and Reasoning (TIME); 2015 22nd International Symposium on,2015,4
Frequent subgraph mining from streams of uncertain data,Carson K Leung; Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Abstract In the current era of Big data; high volumes of high-value data---such as socialnetwork data---can be generated at a high velocity. The quality and accuracy of these datadepend on their veracity: uncertainty of the data. A collection of these uncertain data can beviewed as a big; interlinked; dynamic graph structure. Embedded in these big data areimplicit; previously unknown; and potentially useful knowledge. Hence; efficient and effectiveknowledge discovery algorithms for mining frequent subgraphs from these dynamicstreaming graph structured data are in demand. Most of the existing algorithms minefrequent subgraph from streams of precise data. However; there are many real-life scientificand engineering applications; in which data are uncertain. Hence; in this paper; we proposealgorithms that use limited memory space for mining frequent subgraphs from streams of …,Proceedings of the Eighth International C* Conference on Computer Science & Software Engineering,2015,4
Mining popular patterns: a novel mining problem and its application to static transactional databases and dynamic data streams,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Fan Jiang; Carson K Leung; Dacheng Liu; Aaron Peddle; Syed K Tanbeer,Abstract Since the introduction of the frequent pattern mining problem; researchers haveextended frequent patterns to different useful patterns such as cyclic; emerging; periodic andregular patterns. In this paper; we (i) introduce popular patterns; which capture the popularityof individuals; items; or events among their peers or groups. Moreover; we also propose (ii)the Pop-tree structure to capture the essential information from transactional databases and(iii) the Pop-growth algorithm for mining popular patterns from the Pop-tree. Moreover; weillustrate how our algorithm (iv) mines popular friends from social networks. As we are notconfined to mining popular patterns from static transactional databases; we extend our workto mining popular patterns from dynamic data streams.

SLEMAS: an approach for selecting materialized views under query scheduling constraints,Ahcene Boukorca; Ladjel Bellatreche; Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Abstract Materialized views are one of the most popular optimization techniques selectedduring the physical phase to speed up query processing in traditional and advanceddatabases. Their selection has been proven to be NP-hard. As a consequence largepanoply of heuristics has been proposed to find near optimal solutions. Usually; the selectedmaterialized views are whole life disk resident and their presence is not calling intoquestion. Note that view maintenance can cause significant amounts of CPU and I/O usage;which can be detrimental to performance in a write-intensive database application. Typicallymaterialized views are stored on disk; however with big number of queries; there aresituations where not all a good candidate views will be selected. As a consequence; theirdynamic selection becomes a necessity. In this paper; we address the problem of …,Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Management of Data,2014,4
Real-time data warehousing: A rewrite/merge approach,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Nickerson Ferreira; Pedro Furtado,Abstract This paper focuses on Real-Time Data Warehousing systems; a relevant class ofData Warehouses where the main requirement consists in executing classical datawarehousing operations (eg; loading; aggregation; indexing; OLAP query answering; and soforth) under real-time constraints. This makes classical DW architectures not suitable to thisgoal; and puts the basis for a novel research area which has tight relationship with emergingCloud architectures. Inspired by this motivation; in this paper we proposed a novelframework for supporting Real-Time Data Warehousing which makes use of a rewrite/mergeapproach.

We discuss the approach and show experimental results thatprove the validity of the solution.,International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems,2014,4
Mining of diverse social entities from linked data,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Carson K Leung; Syed K Tanbeer,Nowadays; high volumes of valuable data can be easily generated or collected from variousdata sources at high velocity. As these data are often related or linked; they form a web oflinked data. Examples include semantic web and social web. The social web captures socialrelationships that link people (ie; social entities) through the World Wide Web. Due to thepopularity of social networking sites; more people have joined and more online socialinteractions have taken place. With a huge number of social entities (eg; users or friends insocial networks); it becomes important to analyze high volumes of linked data and discoverthose diverse social entities. In this paper; we present (i) a tree-based mining algorithmcalled DF-growth; along with (ii) its related data structure called DF-tree; which allow usersto effectively and efficiently mine diverse friends from social networks.

Improving OLAP analysis of multidimensional data streams via efficient compression techniques,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Filippo Furfaro; Elio Masciari; Domenico Saccà,AbstrAct Sensor networks represent a leading case of data stream sources coming from real-life application scenarios. Sensors are non-reactive elements which are used to monitor real-life phenomena; such as live weather conditions; network traffic etc. They are usuallyorganized into networks where their readings are transmitted using low level protocols. Arelevant problem in dealing with data streams consists in the fact that they are intrinsicallymulti-level and multidimensional in nature; so that they require to be analyzed by means of amulti-level and a multi-resolution (analysis) model accordingly; like OLAP; beyond traditionalsolutions provided by primitive SQL-based DBMS interfaces. Despite this; a significant issuein dealing with OLAP is represented by the so-called curse of dimensionality problem; whichconsists in the fact that; when the number of dimensions of the target data cube increases …,Intelligent Techniques for Warehousing and Mining Sensor Network Data,2009,4

MapReduce-based algorithms for managing big RDF graphs: State-of-the-art analysis; paradigms; and future directions,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Rajkumar Buyya; Vincenzo Passanisi; Giovanni Pilato,Abstract Big RDF (Resource Description Framework) graphs; which populate the emergingSemantic Web; are the core data structure of the so-called Big Web Data; the" natural"transposition of Big Data on the Web. Managing big RDF graphs is gaining momentum;essentially due to the fact that this task represents the" baseline operation" of fortunate Webbig data analytics. Here; it is required to access; manage and process large-scale; million-node (big) RDF graphs; thus dealing with severe spatio-temporal complexity challenges. Apossible solution to this problem is represented by the so-called MapReduce-model-basedalgorithms for managing big RDF graphs; which try to exploit the computational poweroffered by the MapReduce processing model in order to tame the complexity above.

Computing theoretically-sound upper bounds to expected support for frequent pattern mining problems over uncertain big data,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Carson K Leung,Abstract Frequent pattern mining aims to discover implicit; previously unknown; andpotentially useful knowledge in the form of sets of frequently co-occurring items; events; orobjects. To mine frequent patterns from probabilistic datasets of uncertain data; where eachitem in a transaction is usually associated with an existential probability expressing thelikelihood of its presence in that transaction; the UF-growth algorithm captures importantinformation about uncertain data in a UF-tree structure so that expected support can becomputed for each pattern. A pattern is considered frequent if its expected support meets orexceeds the user-specified threshold. However; a challenge is that the UF-tree can be large.To handle this challenge; several algorithms use smaller trees such that upper bounds toexpected support can be computed. In this paper; we examine these upper bounds; and …,International Conference on Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,2016,3

Here; the main research issue consists inhow to effectively and efficiently extract useful knowledge from (streaming) big data; in orderto support innovative big data analytics platforms. To this end; clustering analysis is a well-known tool for extracting knowledge from big data streams; as also confirmed by recenttrends in active literature. A special applicative case is represented by so-called graph-shaped data (big) streams; which are produced by graph sources providing both structure-and content-oriented knowledge.

An Effective and Efficient MapReduce Algorithm for Computing BFS-Based Traversals of Large-Scale RDF Graphs,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Mirel Cosulschi; Roberto De Virgilio,Abstract Nowadays; a leading instance of big data is represented by Web data that lead tothe definition of so-called big Web data. Indeed; extending beyond to a large number ofcritical applications (eg; Web advertisement); these data expose several characteristics thatclearly adhere to the well-known 3V properties (ie; volume; velocity; variety). ResourceDescription Framework (RDF) is a significant formalism and language for the so-calledSemantic Web; due to the fact that a very wide family of Web entities can be naturallymodeled in a graph-shaped manner. In this context; RDF graphs play a first-class role;because they are widely used in the context of modern Web applications and systems;including the emerging context of social networks. When RDF graphs are defined on top ofbig (Web) data; they lead to the so-called large-scale RDF graphs; which reasonably …,Algorithms,2016,3
A multi-view learning approach to the discovery of deviant process instances,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Francesco Folino; Massimo Guarascio; Luigi Pontieri,Abstract Increasing attention has been paid of late to the problem of detecting andexplaining “deviant” process instances; ie instances diverging from normal/desiredoutcomes (eg; frauds; faults; SLA violations); based on log data. Current solutions allow todiscriminate between deviant and normal instances; by combining the extraction of(sequence-based) behavioral patterns with standard classifier-induction methods. However;there is no general consensus on which kind of patterns are the most suitable for such atask; while mixing multiple pattern families together will produce a cumbersome redundantrepresentation of log data that may well confuse the learner. We here propose an ensemble-learning approach to this deviance mining tasks; where multiple base learners are trainedon different feature-based views of the given log (obtained each by using a distinguished …,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2015,3
Runtime anomaly detection in embedded systems by binary tracing and hidden markov models,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Enzo Mumolo; Riccardo Cecolin,Embedded computing systems are very vulnerable to anomalies that can occur duringexecution of deployed software. Anomalies can be due for example to faults; bugs ordeadlocks during executions. These anomalies can have very dangerous consequences onthe systems controlled by embedded computing devices. Embedded systems are designedto perform autonomously; ie Without any human intervention; and thus the possibility todebug an application to manage the anomaly is very difficult if not impossible. Anomalydetection algorithms are the primary means of being aware of anomalous conditions. In thispaper we describe a novel approach to detect an anomaly during execution of one or moreapplications. The algorithm exploits the differences between the behavior of memorysequences generated during executions.

Our proposal is thusrepresented by a pattern-oriented meta-model for supporting the conceptual modeling ofETL processes in next-generation Data Warehousing environments.

A confidence-based entity resolution approach with incomplete information,Qi Gu; Yan Zhang; Jian Cao; Guandong Xu; Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Entity resolution identifies entities from different data sources that refer to the same real-world entity and it is an important prerequisite for integrating data from multiple sources.Entity resolution mainly relies on similarity measures on data records. Unfortunately; thedata quality of data sources is not so good in practice. Especially web data sources oftenonly provide incomplete information; which leads to the difficulties of direct applyingsimilarity measures to identify the same entities. In order to address this problem; theconcept of confidence is introduced to measure the trustworthy of the similarity calculation.An adaptive rule-based approach is used to calculate the similarity between records and itsconfidence is also derived. Then the similarity and confidence are propagated on the entityrelational graph until fix point is reached. Finally; any pair of two records can be …,Data science and advanced analytics (DSAA); 2014 international conference on,2014,3
A composite methodology for supporting collaboration pattern discovery via semantic enrichment and multidimensional analysis,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Claudia Diamantini; Laura Genga; Domenico Potena; Emanuele Storti,Classical process discovery approaches usually investigate logs generated by processes inorder to mine and discovery corresponding process schemas. When the collaborationprocesses case is addressed; such approaches turn to be poorly effective; due to the factthat:(i) logs of collaboration processes are usually stored in heterogeneous data storageswhich also expose different data types;(ii) it is not easy and direct to derive a commonanalysis model from such logs. As a consequence; classical methodologies usually fail. Inorder to fulfill this gap; in this paper we describe a composite methodology that combinessemantics-based techniques and multidimensional analysis paradigms to support effectiveand efficient collaboration process discovery from log data.,Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition (SoCPaR); 2014 6th International Conference of,2014,3

The uncertainty of data can bemodeled and maintained by existing database integrity technology. The usual requirementthat integrity constraints must always be satisfied needs to be renounced for constraints thatmodel uncertainty. That is possible due to the recently introduced inconsistency tolerance ofmethods for integrity checking; integrity repair and query answering. Inconsistency tolerancealso enables the scaling up of uncertainty management to concurrent transactions.,International Conference on Scalable Uncertainty Management,2012,3

Non-linear data stream compression: foundations and theoretical results,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Hendrik Decker,Abstract In this paper; we provide foundations and theoretical results of a novel paradigm forsupporting data stream miming algorithms effectively and efficiently; the so-called non-lineardata stream compression model. Particularly; the proposed model falls in that class of datastream mining applications where interesting knowledge is extracted via suitable collectionsof OLAP queries from data streams; being latter ones baseline operations of complexknowledge discovery tasks over data streams implemented by ad-hoc data stream miningalgorithms. Here; a fortunate line of research consists in admitting approximate; iecompressed; representation models and query/mining results at the benefit of a moreefficient and faster computation. On top of this main assumption; the proposed non-lineardata stream compression model pursues the idea of maintaining a lower degree of …,International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems,2012,3
Hand-OLAP: Semantics-Aware Compression of Data Cubes for Effective and Efficient OLAP in Mobile Enviroments,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Domenico Saccà,In this paper; we present a complete demonstration of Hand-OLAP; a Java-based distributedsystem that relies on intelligent data cube compression techniques for effectively andefficiently supporting OLAP in mobile environments. Hand-OLAP is based on an innovativesystematic technique according to which first a two-dimensional OLAP view of interest isextracted from the target multidimensional data cube via the so-called OLAP dimensionflattening process; and then this view is compressed by means of a meaningful semantics-based data cube compression approach.

A constraint-based framework for computing privacy preserving OLAP aggregations on data cubes,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Domenico Saccà,Abstract. A constraint-based framework for computing privacy preserving OLAPaggregations on data cubes is proposed and experimentally assessed in this paper. Ourframework introduces a novel privacy OLAP notion; which; following consolidatedparadigms of OLAP research; looks at the privacy of aggregate patterns defined onmultidimensional ranges rather than the privacy of individual tuples/data-cells; like similarefforts in privacy preserving database and data-cube research. To this end; we devise athreshold-based method that aims at simultaneously accomplishing the so-called privacyconstraint; which inferiorly bounds the inference error; and the so-called accuracy constraint;which superiorly bounds the query error; on OLAP aggregations of the target data cube;following a best-effort approach. Finally; we complete our main theoretical contribution by …,ADBIS (2),2011,3
Model-driven data mining engineering: from solution-driven implementations to ‘composable’conceptual data mining models,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Jose-Norberto Mazón; Juan Trujillo; Jose Zubcoff,Data mining lacks a general modelling architecture allowing analysts to consider andinterpret it as a truly software-engineering process; which would be beneficial for a widespectrum of modern application scenarios. Bearing this in mind; in this paper; we proposean innovative model-driven engineering approach of data mining whose main goal consistsin overcoming well-recognised limitations of actual approaches. The cornerstone of ourproposal relies on the definition of a set of suitable model transformations which are able toautomatically generate both the data under analysis; which are deployed via well-consolidated data warehousing technology and the analysis models for the target datamining tasks; which are tailored to a specific data-mining/analysis platform. These modellingtasks are now entrusted to the model-transformation scaffolds and rely on top of a well …,International Journal of Data Mining; Modelling and Management,2011,3

Multiple-objective compression of data cubes in cooperative OLAP environments,Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Abstract Traditional data cube compression techniques do not consider the yet relevantproblem of compressing data cubes in the presence of multiple objectives rather than onlyone (eg; a given space bound). Starting from next-generation OLAP scenarios where thisproblem makes sense; such as those drawn by cooperative OLAP environments; in thispaper we fulfill this lack via (i) introducing and rigorously formalizing the novel multiple-objective data cube compression paradigm; and (ii) providing an effective solution to thisproblem by means of a greedy algorithm able to find a sub-optimal solution and; as aconsequence; an “intermediate” data cube compressed representation that accommodatesa large family of even different OLAP queries; which model the multiple requirements in ourproposed framework.

The main novelty of our approach with respect to traditional datastream compression approaches relies on the semantics of the application in driving thecompression process by identifying” interested” events occurring in the unbounded stream.This puts the basis for a novel class of intelligent applications over data streams where theknowledge on actual streams is integrated with and correlated to the knowledge related toexpired events that are considered critical for the target application scenario.,International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems,2008,3
XℓPPX: A lightweight framework for privacy preserving P2P XML databases in very large publish-subscribe systems,Angela Bonifati; Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Abstract The problem of supporting privacy preservation of XML databases within very largepublish-subscribe systems is rapidly gaining interest for both academic and industrialresearch. It becomes even more challenging when XML data are managed and deliveredaccording to the P2P paradigm; since malicious accesses and unpredictable attacks couldtake advantage from the totally-decentralized and untrusted nature of P2P networks. In thispaper; we propose X ℓ PPX; a distributed framework for very large publish-subscribesystems which supports (i) privacy-preserving fragmentation of XML documents stored inP2P XML databases; and (ii) the creation of trusted groups of peers by means of “self-certifying” XPath links. Furthermore; we present algorithms for querying privacy-preservingXML fragments in both schema-aware and schema-less mode; which are common …,*,2007,3
On the suitability of time series analysis on data warehouses,Jose Zubcoff; Juan Trujillo; Alfredo Cuzzocrea,ABSTRACT Nowadays; Time Series (TS) analysis is done more as an art rather than ascience. It is frequently applied to flat files; obtained from external data sources such asoperational databases. The main reason of this isolated data mining perspective is the lackof a methodology that integrates the conceptual modeling of the repositories; the pre-processing; and the posterior phases of the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)process. Such an isolated perspective of KDD can lead us to duplicate time-consumingtasks such as those of pre-processing steps. On the other hand; considering the main goalsfrom the beginning of the knowledge discovery process allows us to improve data qualitysignificantly. Previous work accomplishes the multidimensional model design of the DataWarehouse (DW). This work provides a conceptual model for the TS analysis on DW via …,Proceedings of European Conference on Data Mining; IADISECDM,2007,3

Incorporating clustering into set similarity join algorithms: the SjClust framework,Leonardo Andrade Ribeiro; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Karen Aline Alves Bezerra; Ben Hur Bahia do Nascimento,Abstract Data cleaning and integration found on duplicate record identification; which aimsat detecting duplicate records that represent the same real-world entity. Similarity join islargely used in order to detect pairs of similar records in combination with a subsequentclustering algorithm meant for grouping together records that refer to the same entity.Unfortunately; the clustering algorithm is strictly used as a post-processing step; which slowsdown the overall performance; and final results are produced at the end of the wholeprocess only. Inspired by this critical evidence; in this paper we propose and experimentallyassess SjClust; a framework to integrate similarity join and clustering into a single operation.The basic idea of our proposal consists in introducing a variety of cluster representationsthat are smoothly merged during the set similarity task; carried out by the join algorithm …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2016,2

Approximation to expected support of frequent itemsets in mining probabilistic sets of uncertain data,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Carson K Leung; Richard Kyle MacKinnon,Abstract Knowledge discovery and data mining generally discovers implicit; previouslyunknown; and useful knowledge from data. As one of the popular knowledge discovery anddata mining tasks; frequent itemset mining; in particular; discovers knowledge in the form ofsets of frequently co-occurring items; events; or objects. On the one hand; in many real-lifeapplications; users mine frequent patterns from traditional databases of precise data; inwhich users know certainly the presence of items in transactions. On the other hand; in manyother real-life applications; users mine frequent itemsets from probabilistic sets of uncertaindata; in which users are uncertain about the likelihood of the presence of items intransactions. Each item in these probabilistic sets of uncertain data is often associated withan existential probability expressing the likelihood of its presence in that transaction.

A global paradigm for designing parallel relational data warehouses in distributed environments,Soumia Benkrid; Ladjel Bellatreche; Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Abstract Designing a Parallel Relational Data Warehouse (PRDW) consists of a set oftasks:(i) choosing the hardware architecture;(ii) fragmenting the data warehouse schema;(iii)allocating the generated fragments;(iv) replicating fragments in order to ensure highperformance;(v) defining the strategies for load balancing and query processing. The majordrawback of this life-cycle is the fact that it does not consider the inter-dependency amongsub-problems related to the design of PRDW; and it makes use of heterogeneous metrics toevaluate the “quality” of the final design. In previous research efforts; we introduced ananalytical cost model for parallel OLAP query processing in cluster environments.

Efficiently compressing olap data cubes via r-tree based recursive partitions,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Carson K Leung,Abstract This paper extends a quad-tree based multi-resolution approach for two-dimensional summary data by providing a novel OLAP data cube compression approachthat keeps the critical novelty of relying on R-tree based partitions instead of moreconstrained classical kinds of partition. This important novelty introduces the nice amenity of(i) allowing end-users to exploit the semantics of data and (ii) obtaining compressedrepresentations of data cubes where more space can be invested to describe those rangesof multidimensional data for which they retain a higher degree of interest. Hence; this papercan be considered as an important advancement over the state-of-the-art approaches.Experimental results confirm the benefits of our proposed approach.,International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems,2012,2
A reachability-based theoretical framework for modeling and querying complex probabilistic graph data,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Paolo Serafino,Probabilistic graph data arise in a plethora of modern applications ranging from sensornetworks to RDF query tools and IP-network monitoring systems. This is due to the fact thatprobabilistic graphs are able to capture and model uncertainty and imprecision thatcharacterize datasets populating the above-mentioned scenarios. On the basis of thisamenity; a large family of proposals devoted to model and query probabilistic graph dataappeared; with alternate fortune. Nevertheless; few of these approaches address achallenge that is; indeed; relevant for graph data management research; ie the issue ofmodeling and querying complex probabilistic graph data; which; contrary to state-of-the-artinitiatives; expose an inherently-complex nature; beyond common confidence-interval-based data models.

A theoretically-sound accuracy/privacy-constrained framework for computing privacy preserving data cubes in OLAP environments,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Domenico Saccà,Abstract State-of-the-art privacy preserving OLAP approaches lack of strong theoreticalbases that provide solid foundations to them. In other words; there is not a theory underlyingsuch approaches; but rather; an algorithmic vision of the problem. A class of methods thatclearly confirm to us the trend above is represented by the so-called perturbation-basedtechniques; which propose to alter the target data cube cell-by-cell to gain privacypreserving query processing. This approach exposes us to clear limits; whose lack ofextendibility and scalability are only the tip of an enormous iceberg. With the aim of fulfillingthis critical drawback; in this paper we propose and experimentally assess a theoretically-sound accuracy/privacy-constrained framework for computing privacy preserving data cubesin OLAP environments.

Frequent itemset mining of distributed uncertain data under user-defined constraints,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Carson K Leung,Many existing distributed data mining algorithms do not allow users to express the patternsto be mined according to their intention via the use of constraints. Consequently; theseunconstrained mining algorithms can yield numerous patterns that are not interesting tousers. Moreover; due to inherited measurement inaccuracies and/or network latencies; dataare often riddled with uncertainty. These call for constrained mining and uncertain datamining. In this paper; we propose a tree-based system for mining frequent itemsets thatsatisfy user-defined constraints from a distributed environment such as a wireless sensornetwork of uncertain data.,*,2012,2

Therefore; we analyze and categorize the different types of queries used bywireless sensor applications. We present a short survey on the existing algorithms that canbe adapted and used to optimize the different types of queries. We present their strengthsand their drawbacks and identify that continuous subset queries can be further optimized.We propose a framework for answering continuous subset queries with multiple operatorsthat can adapt to network and data changes. A query routing tree can be broken down intoan operator tree; an operator placement assignment and a routing scheme. The operatortree defines the order in which the operators will be applied to the data and how the resultswill be pipelined from one operator to the other.

These kind of data are likely to be captured by so-called probabilistic datamodels; which are attracting a great deal of interest from a large community of databaseresearchers. Effectively and efficiently computing OLAP data cubes over probabilistic data isa relevant research challenge that naturally derives from the popularity of uncertain andimprecise datasets. This because OLAP is able of supporting a number of analysisperspectives over such datasets; whit an even-more-critical impact with respect to the caseof traditional datasets (eg; relational databases).

This technique considers the previouslyunrecognized case in which multiple Hierarchical Range Queries (HRQ); a very useful classof OLAP queries; must be evaluated against the target data cube simultaneously. Thisscenario makes traditional data cube compression techniques ineffective; as; contrary to theaim of our work; these techniques take into consideration one constraint only (eg; a givenstorage space bound). The result of our study consists in introducing an innovative multiple-objective OLAP computational paradigm; and a hierarchical multidimensional histogram;whose main benefit is meaningfully implementing an intermediate compression of the inputdata cube able to simultaneously accommodate an even large family of different-in-nature …,Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,2010,2

Models; Issues; and Techniques in OLAP Visualization,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Svetlana Mansmann,The problem of efficiently visualizing multidimensional data sets produced by scientific andstatistical tasks/processes is becoming increasingly challenging; and is attracting theattention of a wide multidisciplinary community of researchers and practitioners. Basically;this problem consists in visualizing multidimensional data sets by capturing thedimensionalityof data; which is the most difficult aspect to be considered. Human analystsinteracting with high-dimensional data often experience disorientation and cognitiveoverload. Analysis of high-dimensional data is a challenge encountered in a wide set of real-life applications such as (i) biological databases storing massive gene and protein datasets;(ii) real-time monitoring systems accumulating data sets produced by multiple; multi-ratestreaming sources;(iii) advanced Business Intelligence,IGI Golbal,2009,2
A Probabilistic Approach for Computing Approximate Iceberg Cubes,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Filippo Furfaro; Giuseppe M Mazzeo,Abstract An iceberg cube is a refinement of a data cube containing the subset of cells whosemeasure is larger than a given threshold (iceberg condition). Iceberg cubes are well-established tools supporting fast data analysis; as they filter the information contained inclassical data cubes to provide the most relevant pieces of information. Although theproblem of efficiently computing iceberg cubes has been widely investigated; this task isintrinsically expensive; due to the large amount of data which must be usually dealt with.Indeed; in several application scenarios; efficiency is so crucial that users would benefit froma fast computation of even incomplete iceberg cubes. In fact; an incomplete iceberg cubecould support preliminary data analysis by allowing users to focus their explorations quicklyand effectively; thus saving large amounts of computational resources.

Grid-VirtuE: A Layered Architecture for Grid Virtual Enterprises,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Alessandro D’Atri; Andrea Gualtieri; Amihai Motro; Domenico Saccà,Abstract A grid virtual enterprise is a community of independent enterprises concerned witha particular sector of the economy. Its members (nodes) are small or medium sizeenterprises (SME) engaged in bilateral transactions. An important principle of a grid virtualenterprise is the lack of any global “guiding force”; with each member of the communitymaking its own independent decisions. In this paper we describe Grid-VirtuE; a three-layerarchitecture for grid virtual enterprises. The top layer of the architecture; representing itsultimate purpose; is an environment in which grid virtual enterprises can be modeled andimplemented. This layer is supported by middleware infrastructure for grids; providing a hostof grid services; such as node-to-node communication; bilateral transactions; and datacollection.

MapReduce-Based Complex Big Data Analytics over Uncertain and Imprecise Social Networks,Peter Braun; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Fan Jiang; Carson Kai-Sang Leung; Adam GM Pazdor,Abstract With advances in technology; high volumes of valuable but complex data can beeasily collected and generated from various sources in the current era of big data. A primesource of these complex big data is the social network; in which users are often linked bysome interdependencies such as friendships and follower-followee relationships. Theseinterdependencies can be uncertain and imprecise. Moreover; as the social network keepsgrowing; there are situations in which individual users or businesses want to find thosepopular (ie; frequently followed) groups of users so that they can follow the same groups. Inthis paper; we present a complex big data analytic solution that uses the MapReduce modelto mine uncertain and imprecise social networks for discovering groups of potentiallypopular users.

Ergodic Hidden Markov Models for Workload Characterization Problems,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Enzo Mumolo; Gianni Vercelli,Abstract We present a novel approach for accurate characterization of workloads. Workloadsare generally described with statistical models and are based on the analysis of resourcerequests measurements of a running program. In this paper we propose to consider thesequence of virtual memory references generated from a program during its execution as atemporal series; and to use spectral analysis principles to process the sequence. However;the sequence is time-varying; so we employed processing approaches based on ErgodicContinuous Hidden Markov Models (ECHMMs) which extend conventional stationaryspectral analysis approaches to the analysis of timevarying sequences. In this work; wedescribe two applications of the proposed approach: the on-line classification of a runningprocess and the generation of synthetic traces of a given workload.

With this aim; we extract triple patterns and filter conditions from SPARQL queriesand we use the OWL API and an OWL ontology reasoner in order to detect wrongexpressions. Given an ontology and a query; the tool reports different kinds of programmingerrors: wrong use of vocabulary; wrong use of resources and literals; wrong filter conditionsand wrong use of variables in triple patterns and filter conditions.

A robust and versatile multi-view learning framework for the detection of deviant business process instances,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Francesco Folino; Massimo Guarascio; Luigi Pontieri,Increasing attention has been paid to the detection and analysis of “deviant” instances of abusiness process that are connected with some kind of “hidden” undesired behavior (egfrauds and faults). In particular; several recent works faced the problem of inducing a binaryclassification model (here named deviance detection model) that can discriminate betweendeviant traces and normal ones; based on a set of historical log traces (labeled as eitherdeviant or normal). Current solutions rely on applying standard classifier-induction methodsto a feature-based representation of the given traces; where the features include sequence-based patterns extracted from the corresponding sequences of activities. However; there isno consensus on which kinds of patterns are the most suitable for such a task. On the otherhand; mixing multiple pattern families together may produce a heterogenous; redundant …,International Journal of Cooperative Information Systems,2016,1

An efficient CUDA-based approximate two-dimensional dynamic programming algorithm for advanced computer vision applications,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Enzo Mumolo; Daniel Pirró; Gianni Vercelli,Dynamic programming is a popular optimization technique; developed in the 60's and stillwidely used today in several fields for its ability to find global optimum. DynamicProgramming Algorithms (DPAs) can be developed in many dimension. However; it isknown that if the DPA dimension is greater or equal to two; the algorithm is an NP completeproblem. In this paper we present an approximation of the fully two-dimensional DPA (2D-DPA) with polynomial complexity. Then; we describe an implementation of the algorithm ona recent parallel device based on CUDA architecture. We show that our parallelimplementation presents a speed-up of about 25 with respect to a sequentialimplementation on an Intel I7 CPU. In particular; our system allows a speed of about ten 2D-DPA executions per second for 85× 85 pixels images.

A multi-view multi-dimensional ensemble learning approach to mining business process deviances,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Francesco Folino; Massimo Guarascio; Luigi Pontieri,The execution logs of a business process have been recently exploited to extractclassification models for discriminating “deviant” instances of the process-ie instancesdiverging from normal/desired outcomes (eg; frauds; faults; SLA violations). Regarding alllog traces as sequences of task labels; current solutions essentially map each trace onto avector space where the features correspond to sequence-oriented patterns; and anystandard classifier-induction method can be applied to separate the two classes ofinstances. An ensemble-learning approach was also recently proposed to combine multiplebase learners trained on heterogenous pattern-based log views. However; as theseapproaches simply abstract each event into an activity symbol; they disregard all the nonstructural event data that are typically stored in real-life logs; and which may well help …,Neural Networks (IJCNN); 2016 International Joint Conference on,2016,1

GPU-Aware Genetic Estimation of Hidden Markov Models for Workload Classification Problems,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Enzo Mumolo; Nicola Timeus; Gianni Vercelli,Hidden Markov models (HMM) have been an important analysis framework in manycomputer science applications. The estimation of the HMM parameters is crucial as regardsthe performance of the whole HMM. Generally; HMM parameters estimation is performedwith iterative algorithm like the Baum-Welch method; or gradient based methods. Theadvantage of the iterative algorithms is their computational efficiency. The disadvantage isthat their performance depend on the initial value of the parameters and thus they usuallyyield to local optimum parameter values. In this paper; a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used tocompute optimized HMM parameters. The algorithm has been implemented on a GPU toface the high demand of computational resources of GA.

SJClust: Towards a Framework for Integrating Similarity Join Algorithms and Clustering.,Leonardo Andrade Ribeiro; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Karen Aline Alves Bezerra; Ben Hur Bahia Do Nascimento,Abstract: A critical task in data cleaning and integration is the identification of duplicaterecords representing the same real-world entity. A popular approach to duplicateidentification employs similarity join to find pairs of similar records followed by a clusteringalgorithm to group together records that refer to the same entity. However; the clusteringalgorithm is strictly used as a post-processing step; which slows down the overallperformance and only produces results at the end of the whole process. In this paper; wepropose SjClust; a framework to integrate similarity join and clustering into a singleoperation. Our approach allows to smoothly accommodating a variety of clusterrepresentation and merging strategies into set similarity join algorithms; while fullyleveraging state-of-the-art optimization techniques.,ICEIS (1),2016,1

The proposed background maintenance algorithm is histogram-based. Thealgorithm has the following main features: fast background initialization; high accuracy indescribing the real background and fast reaction to sudden changes. The basic idea of ouralgorithm is that the pixels are updated only if a statistic measure on the intensity variationsof each pixels is greater to an adaptive threshold; thus reducing the I/O channel occupation.Experimental results on dynamic scenes taken from a fixed camera show that the proposedalgorithm produces background images with an improved quality with respect to classicalpixel-wise algorithms.,Complex; Intelligent; and Software Intensive Systems (CISIS); 2015 Ninth International Conference on,2015,1

Detecting anomalies in embedded computing systems via a novel hmm-based machine learning approach,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Eric Medvet; Enzo Mumolo; Riccardo Cecolin,Abstract Computing systems are vulnerable to anomalies that might occur during executionof deployed software: eg; faults; bugs or deadlocks. When occurring on embeddedcomputing systems; these anomalies may severely hamper the corresponding devices; onthe other hand; embedded systems are designed to perform autonomously; ie; without anyhuman intervention; and thus it is difficult to debug an application to manage the anomaly.Runtime anomaly detection techniques are the primary means of being aware of anomalousconditions.

The idea of our method is toexploit the social knowledge available from reviews about products of any kind; freelyprovided by customers through specialized web sites. We thus define a NoSQL databasesystem for large collections of product reviews; where queries can be expressed in terms ofnatural language sentences whose answers are modeled as lists of products ranked basedon the relevance of reviews wrt the natural language sentences. The best ranked products inthe result list can be seen as the best hints for the user based on crowd opinions (thereviews). By exploiting the well-known IMDb dataset; which comprises more than 2 millionreviews for more than 100;000 movies; we experimentally shows that our prototype …,Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition (SoCPaR); 2014 6th International Conference of,2014,1

Designing parallel relational data warehouses: A global; comprehensive approach,Soumia Benkrid; Ladjel Bellatreche; Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Abstract The process of designing a parallel data warehouse has two main steps:(1)fragmentation and (2) allocation of so-generated fragments at various nodes. Usually; wesplit the data warehouse horizontally; allocate fragments over nodes; and finally balance theload over the nodes of the parallel machine. The main drawback of such design approach isthat the high communication cost. Therefore; Data Replication (DR) has become arequirement for availability on the one hand but also for minimizing the communication coston the other hand. In this paper; we present a redundant allocation algorithm for designingshared-nothing parallel relational data warehouses; which is based on the well-known fuzzyk-means clustering algorithm.,*,2014,1

Uncertain olap over multidimensional data streams: State-of-the-art analysis and research perspectives,Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Abstract Multidimensional data streams are playing a leading role in next-generation DataStream Management Systems (DSMS). This essentially because real-life data streams areinherently multidimensional; multi-level and multi-granular in nature; hence opening thedoor to a wide spectrum of applications ranging from environmental sensor networks tomonitoring and tracking systems; and so forth. As a consequence; there is a need forinnovative models and algorithms for representing and processing such streams. Moreover;supporting OLAP analysis and mining tasks is a “first-class” issue in the major context ofknowledge discovery from streams; for which above-mentioned models and algorithms arebaseline components. This issue becomes more problematic when uncertain and imprecisemultidimensional data streams are considered.

A family of graph-theory-driven algorithms for managing complex probabilistic graph data efficiently,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Paolo Serafino,Abstract Traditionally; a great deal of attention has been devoted to the problem of effectivelymodeling and querying probabilistic graph data. State-of-the-art proposals are not prone todeal with complex probabilistic data; as they essentially introduce simple data models (eg;based on confidence intervals) and straightforward query methodologies (eg; based on thereachability property). According to our vision; these proposals need to be extended towardsachieving the definition of innovative models and algorithms capable of dealing with thehardness of novel requirements posed by managing complex probabilistic graph dataefficiently.

Data cube compression techniques: A theoretical review,Alfredo Cuzzocrea,(Gray; Chaudhuri; Bosworth; Layman; Reichart & Venkatrao; 1997) such as data cubemodeling; representation; indexing and management have traditionally attracted a lot ofattention from the Data Warehousing research community. In this respect; as a fundamentalissue; the problem of efficiently compressing the data cube plays a leading role; and it hasinvolved a vibrant research activity in the academic as well as industrial world during the lastfifteen years. Basically; this problem consists in dealing with massive-in-size data cubes thatmake access and query evaluation costs prohibitive. The widely accepted solution consistsin generating a compressed representation of the target data cube; with the goal of reducingits size (given an input space bound) while admitting loss of information and approximationthat are considered irrelevant for OLAP analysis goals (eg; see (Cuzzocrea; 2005a)) …,Encyclopedia of Data Warehousing and Mining,2006,1

We use IFS to model Speech andElectroencephalographic signals and compare the results. The IFS parameters estimation isperformed by means of a genetic optimization approach. We show that the estimationalgorithm has a very good convergence to the global minimum. This can be successfullyexploited by pattern recognition tools. However; the set-up of the genetic algorithm shouldbe properly tuned. In this paper; besides the optimal set-up description; we describe also thebest tradeoff between performance and computational complexity. To simplify theoptimization problem some constraints are introduced. A comparison with suboptimalalgorithms is reported. The performance of IFS modeling of the considered signals are in …,International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications,2017,*
A Novel Approach for Supporting Approximate Representation of Linear Prediction Residuals in Pattern Recognition Tools,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Enzo Mumolo,Abstract The goal of this paper is to describe an optimization approach for selecting areduced number of samples of the linear prediction residual. This can be extremely useful inpattern recognition tools. Sample determination is a combinatorial problem. Our approachaddresses the combinatorial problem with simulated annealing based optimization. Weshow that better results than that obtained by a standard approximation approach; namelythe multi-pulse algorithm; are obtained with our approach. Multi-pulse selects pulselocations by a sequential; sub-optimal; algorithm and computes the pulses amplitudesaccording to an optimization criteria. Our approach finds the optimal residual samples bymeans of an optimization algorithm approach without amplitudes optimization.

RAPID: A Fast Data Update Protocol in Erasure Coded Storage Systems for Big Data,GJ Akash; Ojus Thomas Lee; SD Kumar; Priya Chandran; Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Abstract Erasure codes are nowadays used extensively in distributed storage systems thathandle big data; since they offer significant fault tolerance with low storage overhead. Eventhough erasure coded systems are space efficient; these involve higher network bandwidthand computational complexity in their operations. In this paper; we present RAPID; aprotocol for fast data updates; which works by choosing a subset of code blocks for updatesand adapts the strength of the subset based on the predicted number of failures. Theproposal uses a prediction based heuristic in which the set of failures that may happen in thenear future is represented as a function of past failures. A hybrid protocol that uses bothlocking and buffering mechanisms is adopted in the solution to maintain the consistency onthe data and code blocks updates.

An effective and efficient hybrid scan matching algorithm for mobile object applications,Kristijan Lenac; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Enzo Mumolo,Abstract In this paper we analyze hybrid scan matching algorithms and we test theirperformances in typical mobile applications. Since the genetic algorithm is robust but notvery accurate; and ICP is accurate but not very robust; it is natural to use the two algorithmsin a cascade fashion: first we run a genetic optimization to find an approximate but robustmatching solution and then we run the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to increase theaccuracy. The proposed genetic algorithm is very fast due to a look-up table formulation andvery robust against large errors in both distance and angle during scan data acquisition. It isworth mentioning that large scan errors arise very commonly in mobile object applicationsdue; for instance; to wheel slippage or when closing loops. We show experimentally that theproposed algorithm successfully copes with large localization errors.,Proceedings of the Symposium on Applied Computing,2017,*

BFSPMiner: an effective and efficient batch-free algorithm for mining sequential patterns over data streams,Marwan Hassani; Daniel Töws; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Supporting sequential pattern mining from data streams is nowadays a relevantproblem in the area of data stream mining research. Actual proposals available in theliterature are based on the well-known PrefixSpan approach and are; indeed; able toeffectively bound the error of discovered patterns. This approach foresees the idea ofdividing the target stream in a collection of manageable chunks; ie; pieces of stream; inorder to gain into effectiveness and efficiency. Unfortunately; mining patterns from streamchunks indeed introduce additional errors with respect to the basic application scenariowhere the target stream is mined continuously; in a non-batch manner. This is due to severalreasons. First; since batches are processed individually; patterns that contain items from twoconsecutive batches are lost. Secondly; in most batch-based approaches; the decision …,International Journal of Data Science and Analytics,2017,*

In this kind of applications; the event must bedetected early in order to reduce the threats; damages. In this paper; we propose a newapproach for early forest fire detection; which is based on the integration of Data Miningtechniques into sensor nodes. The idea is to partition the node set into clusters so that eachnode can individually detect fires using classification techniques. Once a fire is detected; thecorresponding node will send an alert to its cluster-head. This alert will then be routed viagateways; other cluster-heads to the sink in order to inform the firefighters. The approach isvalidated using the CupCarbon simulator. The results show that our approach can provide afast reaction to forest fires with efficient energy consumption.,Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing; Advanced and Trusted Computing; Scalable Computing and Communications; Cloud and Big Data Computing; Internet of People; and Smart World Congress (UIC/ATC/ScalCom/CBDCom/IoP/SmartWorld); 2016 Intl IEEE Conferences,2016,*

Towards An Effective and Efficient Approximation Algorithm for Advanced Computer Vision Applications based on Two-Dimensional Dynamic Programming,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Enzo Mumolo; Giorgio Mario Grasso; Gianni Vercelli,Abstract The Dynamic Programming Algorithm (DPA) was developed in the fifties. However;it is sometimes still used nowadays in various fields because it can easily find the globaloptimum in certain optimization problems. DPA has been applied to problems of one; two orthree dimensions. When the dimension of the problem solved by DPA is equal to one thecomplexity of the algorithm is polynomial but if the size is greater than one; the complexitybecomes NP complete. In such cases a practical implementation of the algorithm is possibleonly using some approximation. In this paper we present a novel approximation of the two-dimensional Dynamic Programming Algorithm (2D-DPA) with polynomial complexity. Wethen describe a parallel implementation of the algorithm on a recent Graphics ProcessingUnit (GPU).,The 22nd International Conference on Distributed Multimedia Systems,2016,*
Temporal Query Processing for Supporting Sustainable-Innovation-Policy Systems,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Ilaria D’Elia; Antonio De Nicola; Hugo Maldini; Maria Luisa Villani,Abstract We propose an innovative method for temporal analysis of integratedenvironmental scenarios aimed at supporting policy making for sustainable innovation. Thisrequires the study of possible effects of low-carbon policies on the society and; hence;copying with a multi-disciplinary domain. In fact scenarios represent possible future states ofthe world under plausible conditions and different assumptions; evaluated under variousperspectives; such as: energy; environment; economy and societal system. Scenarios areusually produced by independent tools (eg; TIMES; GAINS and the Social AccountingMatrix); and once they are integrated; there is a need for new analysis techniques to copewith the complexity of synthetizing possible behaviors of the whole system from a significantnumber of variables of different nature.

Heterogeneous k-anonymization with high utility,Katerina Doka; Mingqiang Xue; Dimitrios Tsoumakos; Panagiotis Karras; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Nectarios Koziris,Among the privacy-preserving approaches that are known in the literature; h-anonymityremains the basis of more advanced models while still being useful as a stand-alonesolution. Applying h-anonymity in practice; though; incurs severe loss of data utility; thuslimiting its effectiveness and reliability in real-life applications and systems. However; suchloss in utility does not necessarily arise from an inherent drawback of the model itself; butrather from the deficiencies of the algorithms used to implement the model. Conventionalapproaches rely on a methodology that publishes data in homogeneous generalizedgroups. An alternative modern data publishing scheme focuses on publishing the data inheterogeneous groups and achieves higher utility; while ensuring the same privacyguarantees. As conventional approaches cannot anonymize data following this …,Big Data (Big Data); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,*
A Novel Information Fusion Approach for Supporting Shadow Detection in Dynamic Environments,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Enzo Mumolo; Alessandro Moro; Kazunori Umeda; Gianni Vercelli,Abstract In this paper we present a system for detecting shadows in dynamic indoor andoutdoor environment. The algorithm we propose fuses together color and stereo disparityinformation. Some considerations on the nature of the shadow improves the algorithm'sability to candidate the pixels as shadow or foreground. The candidate of both color anddisparity information are then weighted by analyzing the effectiveness in the scene.

A GPU-Based Statistical Framework for Moving Object Segmentation: Implementation; Analysis and Applications,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Enzo Mumolo; Alessandro Moro; Kazunori Umeda,Abstract This paper describes a real-time implementation of a recently proposedbackground maintenance algorithm and reports the relative performances. Experimentalresults on dynamic scenes taken from a fixed camera show that the proposed parallelalgorithm produces background images with an improved quality with respect to classicalpixel-wise algorithms; obtaining a speedup of more than 35 times compared to CPUimplementation. It is worth noting that we used both the GeForce 9 series (actually a 9800GPU) available from the year 2008 and the GeForce 200 series (actually a 295 GPU)available from the year 2009. Finally; we show that this parallel implementation allows us touse it in real-time moving object detection application.,International Conference on Internet and Distributed Computing Systems,2015,*

Computing and Mining ClustCube Cubes Efficiently,Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Abstract A novel computational paradigm for clustering complex database objects extractedfrom distributed database settings via well-understood OLAP technology is proposed andexperimentally assessed in this paper. This paradigm conveys in the so-called ClustCubecubes; which define a novel multidimensional data cube model according to which (data)cubes store clustered complex database objects rather than conventional SQL-basedaggregations. A major contribution of this research is represented by effective and efficientalgorithms for computing ClustCube cubes that; surprisingly; are capable of reducingcomputational efforts significantly with respect to traditional approaches.

Coarse-grained workload categorization in virtual environments using the Dempster-Shafer fusion,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Enzo Mumolot; Pietro Corona,Given a number of known reference workloads; and an unknown workload; this paper dealswith the problem of finding the reference workload which is most similar to the unknown one.The depicted scenario turns to be useful in a plethora of modern information systemapplications. We name this problem as coarse-grained workload classification; because;instead of characterizing the unknown workload in terms of finer behaviors; such as CPU;memory; disk or network intensive patterns; we classify the whole unknown workload as oneof the (possible) reference workloads. Reference workloads represent a category ofworkloads that are relevant in a given applicative environment. In particular; we focus ourattention on the classification problem described above in the special case represented byvirtualized environments.

They are in fact the cause and effect of the rapid growth in data observed in the digitalworld. The phenomenon of very large databases and very high rate streaming data hasbeen coined recently as Big Data. The largest two databases for Amazon account for 42terabytes of data in total; and YouTube receives at least 65;000 new videos per day.

That is due to two common exigencies: the postulates of total and ofisolated business rule satisfaction.

OLAP Over Probabilistic Data,Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Probabilistic data (eg;(Barbarà et al.; 1992; Cheng et al.; 2003; Dalvi & Suciu; 2004; Dalvi &Suciu; 2007; Ré & Suciu; 2008; Benjelloun et al.; 2009; Agrawal et al.; 2006; Sarma et al.;2008)) are becoming one of the most attracting kinds of data for database researchers; dueto the fact such a format/formalism perfectly captures two novel; interesting classes ofdatasets that very often occur in modern database application scenarios; namely uncertainand imprecise data (eg;(Ge et al.; 2013)). Uncertain and imprecise data are indeed verypopular; as uncertainty and imprecision affect the same processes devoted to collect datafrom input data sources and make use of these data in order to populate the target database(eg;(Balcan et al.; 2013)). Consider; for instance; the simplest case represented by a sensorydatabase (Bonnet et al.; 2001) populated by a sensor network monitoring the temperature …,*,2014,*

OLAP over Uncertain and Imprecise Data Streams,Alfredo Cuzzocrea,A critical issue in representing; querying and mining data streams consists of the fact thatthey are intrinsically multi-level and multidimensional in nature (Cai et al.; 2004; Han et al.;2005); hence they require to be analyzed by means of multi-level and multi-resolution(analysis) models accordingly. Furthermore; it is a matter of fact to note that enormous dataflows generated by a collection of stream sources naturally require to be processed bymeans of advanced analysis/mining models; beyond traditional solutions provided byprimitive SQL-based DBMS interfaces; and very often high-performance computationalinfrastructures; like Data Grids; are advocated to provide the necessary support to this end(eg;(Cuzzocrea et al.; 2004a; Cuzzocrea et al.; 2004b; Cuzzocrea et al.; 2005)); alsoexploiting fortunate data compression paradigms (eg;(Cuzzocrea;,*,2014,*

Data Compression Techniques and Algorithms for Effectively and Efficiently Managing Multidimensional Stream Cubes over Grids,Alfredo Cuzzocrea,The problem of managing multidimensional stream cubes (ie; data cubes originated fromdata streams) over Computational Grids still plays a critical role in Database and DataWarehousing research; since it covers a wide family of real-life application scenarios.Despite recent technological advancements; high dimensionality and massive size are stillthe most significant challenges to be addressed. In this respect; the usage of datacompression techniques and algorithms is a well-suited and well-understood solution todeal with managing stream cubes over Grids.

Energy Efficiency in W-Grid Data-Centric Sensor Networks via Workload Balancing,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Gianluca Moro; Claudio Sartori,Abstract Wireless sensor networks are usually composed by small units able to sense andtransmit to a sink elementary data which are then processed by an external machine.However; recent improvements in the memory and computational power of sensors; togetherwith the reduction of energy consumption; are rapidly changing the potential of suchsystems; moving the attention towards data-centric sensor networks. In this kind of networks;nodes are smart enough either to store some data and to perform basic processing allowingthe network itself to supply higher level information closer to the network user expectations.In other words; sensors no longer transmit each elementary data sensed; rather theycooperate in order to assemble them in more complex and synthetic information; which willbe locally stored and transmitted according to queries and/or events defined by users and …,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2013,*

SDWM: An Enhanced Spatial Data Warehouse Metamodel.,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Robson do Nascimento Fidalgo,Abstract. Some research has been done in order to define metamodels for Spatial DataWarehouses (SDW) modeling. However; we observe that most of these works proposemetamodels that mix concepts of DW modeling (ie dimensions and their descriptiveattributes) with concepts of OLAP modeling (ie hierarchies and their levels). We understandthat this mix is a possible limitation; because a DW (conventional or spatial) is essentially alarge data repository; which can be analyzed/queried by any data analysis technology (egGIS; Data Mining and OLAP). With aim of overcoming such limitation; in this paper wepropose a SDW metamodel; named Spatial Data Warehouse Metamodel (SDWM); whichdescribes constructors and restrictions needed to model SDW schemas.

Improving Flexibility of Workflow Management Systems via a Policy-enhanced Collaborative Framework.,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Marco Fisichella,Abstract: Workflow Management Systems available to date present limitations concerningthe flexibility of the resulting processes; which enlarge the gap between business processesmodels; humans and their activities. In real-world scenarios; especially when collaborationamong human actors takes place; it is often the case that the tasks a process consists ofappear in many subtle variants according to the actor who has to carry them out. In thispaper we focus on a system which integrates Web platform for collaborative processes;COOPER; and a policy manager based on Semantic Web technologies; PROTUNE; canenhance process flexibility and variability to accommodate the needs of different processactors.,WEBIST,2012,*

Supporting Roll-Up and Drill-Down Operations over OLAP Data Cubes with Continuous Dimensions via Density-Based Hierarchical Clustering.,Michelangelo Ceci; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Donato Malerba,Abstract. In traditional OLAP systems; roll-up and drill-down operations over data cubesexploit fixed hierarchies defined on discrete attributes that play the roles of dimensions; andoperate along them. However; in recent years; a new tendency of considering evencontinuous attributes as dimensions; hence hierarchical members become continuousaccordingly; has emerged mostly due to novel and emerging application scenarios likesensor and data stream management tools. A clear advantage of this emerging approach isthat of avoiding the beforehand definition of an ad-hoc discretization hierarchy along eachOLAP dimension. Following this latest trend; in this paper we propose a novel method foreffectively and efficiently supporting roll-up and drill-down operations over OLAP data cubeswith continuous dimensions via a density-based hierarchical clustering algorithm.

Clustering Relational Data: A Transactional Approach,Gianni Costa; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Giuseppe Manco; Riccardo Ortale,A methodology for clustering multi-relational data is proposed. Initially; tuple linkages in thedatabase schema of the multi-relational entities are leveraged to virtually organize theavailable relational data into as many transactions; ie sets of feature-value pairs. Theidentified transactions are then partitioned into homogeneous groups. Each discoveredcluster is equipped with a representative; that provides an explanation of the correspondinggroup of transactions; in terms of those feature-value pairs that are most likely to appear in atransaction belonging to that particular group. Outlier data are placed into a trash cluster;that is finally partitioned to mitigate the dissimilarity between the trash cluster and thepreviously generated clusters.,Tools with Artificial Intelligence; 2009.

Models and Techniques for Approximate Queries in OLAP,Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Abstract Since the size of the underlying data warehouse server (DWS) is usually very large;response time needed for computing queries is the main issue in decision support systems(DSS). Business analysis is the main application field in the context of DSS; as well as OLAPqueries being the most useful ones; in fact; these queries allow us to support different kindsof analysis based on a multi-resolution and a multi-dimensional view of the data. Byperforming OLAP queries; business analysts can efficiently extract summarized knowledge;by means of SQL aggregation operators; from very large repositories of data like thosestored in massive DWSs. Then; the extracted knowledge is exploited to support decisions instrategic fields of the target business; thus efficiently taking advantage from the amenity ofexploring and mining massive data via OLAP technologies.

Approximate aggregate query processing isable to provide fast answers to aggregate queries by trading off accuracy for efficiency; andhas become a useful tool to many DSS-based applications. Researchers have devoted agreat deal of attention to the problem of efficiently compressing data cubes in order toretrieve approximate answers having low query errors. However; few works only focus onthe problem of deriving theoretical bounds over these errors; which is indeed a criticalaspect for any database/datacube approximation technique.

A Query-Strategy-Focused Taxonomy of P2P IR Techniques,Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Abstract During the last years; there was a growing interest in peer-to-peer (P2P) systems;mainly because they fit a wide number of real-life ICT applications. Digital libraries are onlya significant instance of P2P systems; but it is very easy to foresee how large the impact ofP2P systems on innovative and emerging ICT scenarios; such as e-government and e-procurement; will be during the next years. P2P networks are natively built on top of a verylarge repository of data objects (eg; files) that is intrinsically distributed; fragmented; andpartitioned among participant peers. P2P users are usually interested in (a) retrieving dataobjects containing information of interest; like video and audio files; and (b) sharinginformation with other (participant) users or peers. From the information retrieval (IR)perspective; P2P users (a) typically submit short; loose queries by means of keywords …,*,2009,*

In fact; although if one can suppose that re-writing and re-adapting data structures; algorithms; and data reliability/dependabilityschemes is the natural way to support efficient data management on mobile environments;new issues and old limitations arise; particularly for what concerns with data availability andconsistency in wireless network environments.,*,2009,*
Modeling and Querying XMLBased P2P Information Systems: A Semantics-Based Approach,Alfredo Cuzzocrea,AbstrAct Knowledge representation and management techniques can be efficiently used toimprove data modeling and IR functionalities of P2P Information Systems; which haverecently attracted a lot of attention from both industrial and academic research communities.These functionalities can be achieved by pushing semantics in both data and queries; andexploiting the derived expressiveness to improve file sharing primitives and lookupmechanisms made available by first-generation P2P systems. XML-based P2P InformationSystems are a more specific instance of this class of systems; where the overall data domainis composed by very large; Internet-like distributed XML repositories from which usersextract useful knowledge by means of IR methods implemented on top of XML join queriesagainst the repositories. In this chapter; we first focus our attention on the definition and …,The Semantic Web for Knowledge and Data Management: Technologies and Practices,2008,*

Knowledge Personalization in Web-Services-Based Environments: A Unified Approach,Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Abstract Inherited from Database and Information Systems research; knowledgerepresentation and management are next challenges for Web Information Systems research.Currently; Web Services are the widely accepted standard for building next-generation Web-based platforms and systems where users and machines are co-operant; and new servicescan be dynamically composed from a set of pre-existent services. In the context of Webservices; due to the enormous size of Web data repositories (eg; XML-based) and the verylarge number of available services (eg; UDDI-based) that can be invoked; the so-calledknowledge personalization problem plays a critical role; and is currently attracting a lot ofattention from research communities. Starting from these considerations; in this chapter wepropose models and algorithms for efficiently representing; managing and personalizing …,*,2008,*
A Multi-Relational Approach to Clustering Trajectory Data,Gianni Costa; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Giuseppe Manco; Riccardo Ortale; Howard Scordio,Abstract. We propose a novel methodology for clustering multi-relational trajectory data. Ourmethodology consists of two steps. Initially; tuple linkages; defined in the database schemaof the multi-relational trajectories; are leveraged to virtually organize the available route datainto as many transactions; ie as sets of feature-value pairs. The identified transactions arethen partitioned into homogeneous groups. Each discovered cluster is equipped with arepresentative; that provides an explanation of the corresponding group of trajectories; interms of those feature-value pairs that are most likely to appear in a transaction belonging tothat particular group. Outliers trajectories are placed into a trash cluster; that is finallypartitioned to mitigate the dissimilarity between the trash cluster and the previouslygenerated clusters.,SIXTH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON MULTI-RELATIONAL DATA MINING,2007,*

Querying Unstructured and Structured Peer-to-Peer Networks: Models; Issues; Algorithms.,Alfredo Cuzzocrea,ABSTRACT: Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks are defined as a collection of peers that exposeclient/server functionalities simultaneously. P2P systems; built on top of P2P networks;support information sharing primitives and lookup mechanisms of data objects located onpeers. It has been demonstrated that the P2P paradigm is able to efficiently capture modelsand; above all; dynamics of modern applications; beyond limitations of conventionalproduce/consumer paradigms. Traditionally; P2P primitives and mechanisms have beenimplemented by means of keyword-based search and matching operations. Modern P2Psystems require more complex query functionalities; beyond capabilities of DBMS-inspiredmodels and algorithms. As a consequence; the issue of efficiently querying the underlingP2P network is gaining momentum in the research community. Indeed; querying P2P …,Journal of Digital Information Management,2007,*

Towards a Lightweight Framework for Privacy Preserving P2P XML Databases,Angela Bonifati; Alfredo Cuzzocrea,The problem of securing XML databases is rapidly gaining interest for both academic andindustrial research. It becomes even more challenging when XML data are managed anddelivered according to the P2P paradigm; as malicious attacks could take advantage fromthe totally-decentralized and untrusted nature of P2P networks. Starting from theseconsiderations; in this paper we propose the guidelines of a distributed framework forsupporting (i) secure fragmentation of XML documents into P2P XML databases by means oflightweight XPath-based identifiers; and (it) the creation of trusted groups of peers by meansof" self-certifying" XPath links that exploit the benefits of well-known fingerprintingtechniques,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2006.

The model makes use of XML for the description of metadata about “neutral”pages that have to be adapted to user characteristics. Moreover; we propose a three-dimensional approach to model different aspects of the adaptation model; based on differentuser characteristics: an adaptive hypermedia is modeled with respect to such dimensions;and a view over it corresponds to each potential position of the user in the “adaptation …,International Conference on Electronic Commerce and Web Technologies,2004,*

Fragmenting XML Documents,Angela Bonifati; Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Bruno Zinnol,Abstract. XML queryprocessors suffer from main-memory limitations that prevent them fromprocessing large XML documents. While content-based predi. cates can be used to projectdown parts of the documents; it may still be needed to resize the obtained projectionsaccording to structural constraints. In this ра-per; we consider size; tree-width and tree-depthconstraints to enable a structure. driven fragmentation of XML documents. Although a set ofheuristics performing this kind offragmentation can be easily devised; a key problem isdetermining the values of structural constraints input to the above heuristics; given that thesearch space is prohibitive at large.

This paper provides anatomy; models and functionalities of a DBMS-basedsystems for integrating Grids and Clouds. Our study starts from recognizing the similarity ofsome axioms of Grid and Cloud computing; still being these computational paradigms verydifferent for what regards both computing and economic models. Our proposed system iscentered along a well-designed DBMS schema that allows to obtain a seamless integrationbetween Grids and IaaS Cloud providers. The paper details how images from a Cloudenvironment are deployed in reply to a specific task execution invoked from the (integrated)Grid environment; as well as other essential components of the proposed architecture (eg;resource access and grant; user authorization; resource discovery and sharing; job and taskmanagement and distribution; integration with other computational platforms; and so forth …,*,*,*
A WSLA-Extension Supporting Service and Contract Composition Modelling,Antonella Longo; Marco Zappatore; Mario A Bochicchio; Lucia Vaira; Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Abstract: When dealing with Cloud Computing Services (CCSs) provisioning and usage;different degrees of complexity can be reached; depending on whether service compositionis needed to satisfy users' requests. This scenario demands effective ways for modellingCCSs and corresponding Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in order to facilitate servicecomposition; comparison and monitoring. However; current SLA specifications and tools arenot well tailored to service composition. In this paper; starting from WSLA; a widely-knownSLA description language; we present an extension aimed at modeling contracts and SLAssuitable to support contract owners during service composition and monitoring phases. Theproposed WSLA extension is also supported by a tree-graph based tool that can help duringSLA and contract composition phases.,*,*,*

Deployment of Parallel Data Warehouse Joint Design in Teradata,Ladjel Bellatreche; Soumia Benkrid; Ahmad Ghazal; Alain Crolotte; Alfredo Cuzzocrea,Abstract. Parallel databases play an important role in delivering performance required bydata warehousing applications. Such performance can not be accomplished without a goodscheme for fragmentation and allocation of data. Both problems are NP-hard problems andoptimal solutions are impractical in real life situations. These two problems were addressedextensively in research and there are a lot of heuristic based efficient solutions that providegood results. In these solutions; the fragmentation and allocation were done separately. Inour previous work; we proposed a genetic solution that solves both problems simultaneouslywhich we refer to as a the joint solution. The joint solution was tested on some knownbenchmarks using internal simulations of a parallel database. These simulations are notreliable since it lacked the real life aspects of parallelism. This paper addresses this issue …,*,*,*

Welcome from the Co-chairs First International Workshop on Distributed XML Processing: Theory and Practice (DXP 2009),Alfredo Cuzzocrea; David Taniar,XML is widely recognized as the standard de facto for coupling with the heterogeneity ofdata repositories and software platforms of distributed environments. In light of this;distributed XML processing plays a key role in the context of a plethora of modern distributeddata; information and knowledge management applications and systems. Distributed XMLprocessing deals with both theoretical and practical aspects; ranging from sophisticatedtheoretical tools to efficient algorithms and frameworks. A wide number of open researchissues and challenges derive from meaningfully handling XML in distributed environments.Inspired by these research challenges; the First International Workshop on Distributed XMLProcessing: Theory and Practice (DXP 2009); which is organized in conjunction with the38th International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP 2009); Vienna; Austria …,*,*,*
