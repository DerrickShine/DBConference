Private queries in location based services: anonymizers are not necessary,Gabriel Ghinita; Panos Kalnis; Ali Khoshgozaran; Cyrus Shahabi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Mobile devices equipped with positioning capabilities (eg; GPS) can ask location-dependent queries to Location Based Services (LBS). To protect privacy; the user locationmust not be disclosed. Existing solutions utilize a trusted anonymizer between the users andthe LBS. This approach has several drawbacks:(i) All users must trust the third partyanonymizer; which is a single point of attack.(ii) A large number of cooperating; trustworthyusers is needed.(iii) Privacy is guaranteed only for a single snapshot of user locations; usersare not protected against correlation attacks (eg; history of user movement). We propose anovel framework to support private location-dependent queries; based on the theoreticalwork on Private Information Retrieval (PIR). Our framework does not require a trusted thirdparty; since privacy is achieved via cryptographic techniques.

Voronoi-based k nearest neighbor search for spatial network databases,Mohammad Kolahdouzan; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract A frequent type of query in spatial networks (eg; road networks) is to find the Knearest neighbors (KNN) of a given query object. With these networks; the distancesbetween objects depend on their network connectivity and it is computationally expensive tocompute the distances (eg; shortest paths) between objects. In this paper; we propose anovel approach to efficiently and accurately evaluate KNN queries in spatial networkdatabases using first order Voronoi diagram. This approach is based on partitioning a largenetwork to small Voronoi regions; and then pre-computing distances both within and acrossthe regions. By localizing the precomputation within the regions; we save on both storageand computation and by performing across-the-network computation for only the borderpoints of the neighboring regions; we avoid global pre-computation between every node …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,579
Knowledge discovery from users web-page navigation,Cyrus Shahabi; Amir M Zarkesh; Jafar Adibi; Vishal Shah,The authors propose to detect users' navigation paths to the advantage of Web site owners.First; they explain the design and implementation of a profiler which captures a client'sselected links and page order; accurate page viewing time and cache references; using aJava based remote agent. The information captured by the profiler is then utilized by aknowledge discovery technique to cluster users with similar interests. They introduce a novelpath clustering method based on the similarity of the history of user navigation. Thisapproach is capable of capturing the interests of the user which could persist throughseveral subsequent hypertext link selections. Finally; they evaluate their path clusteringtechnique via a simulation study on a sample WWW site. They show that; depending on thelevel of inserted noise; they can recover the correct clusters by 10%-27% of average error …,Research Issues in Data Engineering; 1997. Proceedings.

Big data and its technical challenges,HV Jagadish; Johannes Gehrke; Alexandros Labrinidis; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Jignesh M Patel; Raghu Ramakrishnan; Cyrus Shahabi,The growth rate of the output of current NGS methods in terms of the raw sequence data producedby a single NGS machine is shown in Figure 1; along with the performance increase for the SPECintCPU benchmark. Clearly; the NGS sequence data growth far outstrips the performance gainsoffered by Moore's Law for single-threaded applications (here; SPECint). Note the sequencedata size in Figure 1 is the output of analyzing the raw images that are actually produced by theNGS instruments. The size of these raw image datasets themselves is so large (many TBs perlab per day) that it is impractical today to even consider storing them. Rather; these images areanalyzed on the fly to produce sequence data; which is then retained … Big Data has the potentialto revolutionize much more than just research.

The spatial skyline queries,Mehdi Sharifzadeh; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract In this paper; for the first time; we introduce the concept of Spatial Skyline Queries(SSQ). Given a set of data points P and a set of query points Q each data point has a numberof derived spatial attributes each of which is the point's distance to a query point. An SSQretrieves those points of P which are not dominated by any other point in P considering theirderived spatial attributes. The main difference with the regular skyline query is that thisspatial domination depends on the location of the query points Q SSQ has application inseveral domains such as emergency response and online maps. The main intuition andnovelty behind our approaches is that we exploit the geometric properties of the SSQproblem space to avoid the exhaustive examination of all the point pairs in P and Q.Consequently; we reduce the complexity of SSQ search from O (| P| 2| Q|) to O (| S| 2| C|+ …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,316
Blind evaluation of nearest neighbor queries using space transformation to preserve location privacy,Ali Khoshgozaran; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract In this paper we propose a fundamental approach to perform the class of NearestNeighbor (NN) queries; the core class of queries used in many of the location-basedservices; without revealing the origin of the query in order to preserve the privacy of thisinformation. The idea behind our approach is to utilize one-way transformations to map thespace of all static and dynamic objects to another space and resolve the query blindly in thetransformed space. However; in order to become a viable approach; the transformation usedshould be able to resolve NN queries in the transformed space accurately and moreimportantly prevent malicious use of transformed data by untrusted entities. Traditionalencryption based techniques incur expensive O (n) computation cost (where n is the totalnumber of points in space) and possibly logarithmic communication cost for resolving a …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2007,297

A road network embedding technique for k-nearest neighbor search in moving object databases,Cyrus Shahabi; Mohammad R Kolahdouzan; Mehdi Sharifzadeh,Abstract A very important class of queries in GIS applications is the class of K-nearestneighbor queries. Most of the current studies on the K-nearest neighbor queries utilizespatial index structures and hence are based on the Euclidean distances between thepoints. In real-world road networks; however; the shortest distance between two pointsdepends on the actual path connecting the points and cannot be computed accurately usingone of the Minkowski metrics. Thus; the Euclidean distance may not properly approximatethe real distance. In this paper; we apply an embedding technique to transform a roadnetwork to a high dimensional space in order to utilize computationally simple Minkowskimetrics for distance measurement. Subsequently; we extend our approach to dynamicallytransform new points into the embedding space. Finally; we propose an efficient …,GeoInformatica,2003,226
Wspds: Web services peer-to-peer discovery service,Farnoush Banaei-Kashani; Ching-Chien Chen; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract—The Web Services infrastructure is a distributed computing environment forservice-sharing. In this environment; resource discovery is required as a primitivefunctionality for users to be able to locate the services; the shared resources. A discoveryservice with centralized architecture; such as UDDI; restricts the scalability of thisenvironment as it grows to the scales comparable with the size of the web itself. In addition;current extensively used web service standards (eg UDDI; WSDL); do not support discoveryat a semantic level. In this paper; we introduce WSPDS (Web Services Peer-to-peerDiscovery Service); a fully decentralized and interoperable discovery service with semantic-level matching capability. We believe the peer-topeer architecture of the semantic-enabledWSPDS not only satisfies the design requirements for efficient and accurate discovery in …,Proceedings of the International Conference on Internet Computing,2004,194
Geocrowd: enabling query answering with spatial crowdsourcing,Leyla Kazemi; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract With the ubiquity of mobile devices; spatial crowdsourcing is emerging as a newplatform; enabling spatial tasks (ie; tasks related to a location) assigned to and performed byhuman workers. In this paper; for the first time we introduce a taxonomy for spatialcrowdsourcing. Subsequently; we focus on one class of this taxonomy; in which workerssend their locations to a centralized server and thereafter the server assigns to every workerhis nearby tasks with the objective of maximizing the overall number of assigned tasks. Weformally define this maximum task assignment (or MTA) problem in spatial crowdsourcing;and identify its challenges. We propose alternative solutions to address these challenges byexploiting the spatial properties of the problem space.

The Clustered AGgregation (CAG) technique leveraging spatial and temporal correlations in wireless sensor networks,Sunhee Yoon; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Sensed data in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) reflect the spatial and temporalcorrelations of physical attributes existing intrinsically in the environment. In this article; wepresent the Clustered AGgregation (CAG) algorithm that forms clusters of nodes sensingsimilar values within a given threshold (spatial correlation); and these clusters remainunchanged as long as the sensor values stay within a threshold over time (temporalcorrelation). With CAG; only one sensor reading per cluster is transmitted whereas with TinyAGgregation (TAG) all the nodes in the network transmit the sensor readings. Thus; CAGprovides energy efficient and approximate aggregation results with small and oftennegligible and bounded error. In this article we extend our initial work in CAG in fivedirections: First; we investigate the effectiveness of CAG that exploits the temporal as well …,ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks (TOSN),2007,185
Feature subset selection and feature ranking for multivariate time series,Hyunjin Yoon; Kiyoung Yang; Cyrus Shahabi,Feature subset selection (FSS) is a known technique to preprocess the data beforeperforming any data mining tasks; eg; classification and clustering. FSS provides both cost-effective predictors and a better understanding of the underlying process that generated thedata. We propose a family of novel unsupervised methods for feature subset selection frommultivariate time series (MTS) based on common principal component analysis; termedCLeVer. Traditional FSS techniques; such as recursive feature elimination (RFE) and Fishercriterion (FC); have been applied to MTS data sets; eg; brain computer interface (BCI) datasets. However; these techniques may lose the correlation information among features; whileour proposed techniques utilize the properties of the principal component analysis to retainthat information. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our selected subset of features …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2005,170
The optimal sequenced route query,Mehdi Sharifzadeh; Mohammad Kolahdouzan; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Real-world road-planning applications often result in the formulation of newvariations of the nearest neighbor (NN) problem requiring new solutions. In this paper; westudy an unexplored form of NN queries named optimal sequenced route (OSR) query inboth vector and metric spaces. OSR strives to find a route of minimum length starting from agiven source location and passing through a number of typed locations in a particular orderimposed on the types of the locations. We first transform the OSR problem into a shortestpath problem on a large planar graph. We show that a classic shortest path algorithm suchas Dijkstra's is impractical for most real-world scenarios. Therefore; we propose LORD; alight threshold-based iterative algorithm; which utilizes various thresholds to prune thelocations that cannot belong to the optimal route. Then we propose R-LORD; an …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2008,166
Crowd sensing of traffic anomalies based on human mobility and social media,Bei Pan; Yu Zheng; David Wilkie; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract The advances in mobile computing and social networking services enable peopleto probe the dynamics of a city. In this paper; we address the problem of detecting anddescribing traffic anomalies using crowd sensing with two forms of data; human mobility andsocial media. Traffic anomalies are caused by accidents; control; protests; sport events;celebrations; disasters and other events. Unlike existing traffic-anomaly-detection methods;we identify anomalies according to drivers' routing behavior on an urban road network.Here; a detected anomaly is represented by a sub-graph of a road network where drivers'routing behaviors significantly differ from their original patterns. We then try to describe thedetected anomaly by mining representative terms from the social media that people postedwhen the anomaly happened. The system for detecting such traffic anomalies can benefit …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2013,159
Tsa-tree: A wavelet-based approach to improve the efficiency of multi-level surprise and trend queries on time-series data,Cyrus Shahabi; Xiaoming Tian; Wugang Zhao,We introduce a novel wavelet based tree structure; termed TSA-tree; which improves theefficiency of multi-level trend and surprise queries on time sequence data. With theexplosion of scientific observation data conceptualized as time sequences; we are facing thechallenge of efficiently storing; retrieving and analyzing this data. Frequent queries on thisdata set are to find trends (eg; global warming) or surprises (eg; undersea volcano eruption)within the original time series. The challenge; however is that these trend and surprisequeries are needed at different levels of abstractions. To support these multi-level trend andsurprise queries; sometimes a huge subset of raw data needs to be retrieved andprocessed. To expedite this process; we utilize our TSA-tree. Each node of the TSA-treecontains pre-computed trends and surprises at different levels. A wavelet transform is …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2000.

Image retrieval by shape: a comparative study,Maytham Safar; Cyrus Shahabi; Xiaoming Sun,Besides traditional applications (eg CAD/CAM and trademark registry); new multimediaapplications; such as structured video; animation and the MPEG-7 standard; require thestorage and management of well-defined objects. We focus on shape-based object retrievaland conduct a comparison study on four such techniques: Fourier descriptors (FD); the grid-based (GB) method; Delaunay triangulation (DT) and MBC-TPVAS (minimum boundingcircles/touch-point vertex-angle sequence). Our results show that the similarity retrievalaccuracy of our method (TVPAS) is as good as the other methods; while it has the lowestcomputational cost for generating the shape signatures of the objects. Moreover; it has lowstorage requirements and a comparable computation cost to compute the similarity betweentwo shape signatures. In addition; TPVAS requires no normalization of the objects and is …,Multimedia and Expo; 2000. ICME 2000. 2000 IEEE International Conference on,2000,144
A framework for protecting worker location privacy in spatial crowdsourcing,Hien To; Gabriel Ghinita; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) is a transformative platform that engages individuals;groups and communities in the act of collecting; analyzing; and disseminatingenvironmental; social and other spatio-temporal information. The objective of SC is tooutsource a set of spatio-temporal tasks to a set of workers; ie; individuals with mobiledevices that perform the tasks by physically traveling to specified locations of interest.However; current solutions require the workers; who in many cases are simply volunteeringfor a cause; to disclose their locations to untrustworthy entities. In this paper; we introduce aframework for protecting location privacy of workers participating in SC tasks. We argue thatexisting location privacy techniques are not sufficient for SC; and we propose a mechanismbased on differential privacy and geocasting that achieves effective SC services while …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,132
Continuous K-Nearest Neighbor Queries in Spatial Network Databases.,Mohammad R Kolahdouzan; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Continuous K nearest neighbor queries (CKNN) are defined as the nearest pointsof interest to all the points on a path (eg; continuously finding the three nearest gas stationsto a moving car). The result of this type of query is a set of intervals (or split points) and theircorresponding KNNs; such that the KNNs of all objects within each interval are the same.The current studies on C-KNN focus on Euclidean spaces. These studies are not applicableto spatial network databases (SNDB) where the distance between two objects is defined asthe length of the shortest path between them. In this paper; we propose two techniques toaddress C-KNN queries in SNDB: IE and UBA. Our empirical experiments show that theUBA approach outperforms IE; specially when the points of interest are sparsely distributedin the network.,STDBM,2004,120
Exploiting spatial correlation towards an energy efficient clustered aggregation technique (cag)[wireless sensor network applications],SunHee Yoon; Cyrus Shahabi,In wireless sensor networks (WSN); monitoring applications use in-network aggregation tominimize energy overhead by reducing the number of transmissions between the nodes. Wenote that nearby sensor nodes monitoring an environmental feature (eg; temperature orbrightness) typically register similar values. In this paper; we propose clustered aggregation(CAG); which is a mechanism that reduces the number of transmissions and providesapproximate results to aggregate queries by utilizing the spatial correlation of sensor data.The result is guaranteed to be within a user-provided error-tolerance threshold. While aquery is disseminated to the network; CAG forms clusters of nodes sensing similar values.Subsequently; only one value per cluster is transmitted up the aggregation tree.

Location privacy: going beyond K-anonymity; cloaking and anonymizers,Ali Khoshgozaran; Cyrus Shahabi; Houtan Shirani-Mehr,Abstract With many location-based services; it is implicitly assumed that the location serverreceives actual users locations to respond to their spatial queries. Consequently; informationcustomized to their locations; such as nearest points of interest can be provided. However;there is a major privacy concern over sharing such sensitive information with potentiallymalicious servers; jeopardizing users' private information. The anonymity-and cloaking-based approaches proposed to address this problem cannot provide stringent privacyguarantees without incurring costly computation and communication overhead. Furthermore;they require a trusted intermediate anonymizer to protect user locations during queryprocessing. This paper proposes a fundamental approach based on private informationretrieval to process range and K-nearest neighbor queries; the prevalent queries used in …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2011,111
Yoda: An accurate and scalable web-based recommendation system,Cyrus Shahabi; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani; Yi-Shin Chen; Dennis McLeod,Abstract Recommendation systems are applied to personalize and customize the Webenvironment. We have developed a recommendation system; termed Yoda; that is designedto support large-scale Web-based applications requiring highly accurate recommendationsin real-time. With Yoda; we introduce a hybrid approach that combines collaborative filtering(CF) and content-based querying to achieve higher accuracy. Yoda is structured as atunable model that is trained off-line and employed for real-time recommendation on-line.The on-line process benefits from an optimized aggregation function with low complexity thatallows realtime weighted aggregation of the soft classification of active users to predefinedrecommendation sets. Leveraging on localized distribution of the recommendable items; thesame aggregation function is further optimized for the off-line process to reduce the time …,International Conference on Cooperative Information Systems,2001,110
Supporting spatial aggregation in sensor network databases,Mehdi Sharifzadeh; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Sensor networks are unattended deeply distributed systems whose schema can beconceptualized using the relational model. Aggregation queries on the data sampled ateach sensor node are the main means to extract the abstract characteristics of thesurrounding environment. However; the non-uniform distribution of the sensor nodes in theenvironment leads to inaccurate results generated by the aggregation queries. In this paper;we introduce" spatial aggregations" that take into consideration the distribution of the valuesgenerated by the sensor nodes. We propose the use of spatial interpolation methodsderived from the fields of spatial statistics and computational geometry to answer spatialaggregations. In particular; we study Spatial Moving Average (SMA); Voronoi Diagram andTriangulated Irregular Network (TIN).

Voronoi-based geospatial query processing with mapreduce,Afsin Akdogan; Ugur Demiryurek; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani; Cyrus Shahabi,Geospatial queries (GQ) have been used in a wide variety of applications such as decisionsupport systems; profile-based marketing; bioinformatics and GIS. Most of the existing query-answering approaches assume centralized processing on a single machine although GQsare intrinsically parallelizable. There are some approaches that have been designed forparallel databases and cluster systems; however; these only apply to the systems withlimited parallel processing capability; far from that of the cloud-based platforms.

Vor-tree: R-trees with voronoi diagrams for efficient processing of spatial nearest neighbor queries,Mehdi Sharifzadeh; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract A very important class of spatial queries consists of nearest-neighbor (NN) queryand its variations. Many studies in the past decade utilize R-trees as their underlying indexstructures to address NN queries efficiently. The general approach is to use R-tree in twophases. First; R-tree's hierarchical structure is used to quickly arrive to the neighborhood ofthe result set. Second; the R-tree nodes intersecting with the local neighborhood (SearchRegion) of an initial answer are investigated to find all the members of the result set. While R-trees are very efficient for the first phase; they usually result in the unnecessary investigationof many nodes that none or only a small subset of their including points belongs to the actualresult set. On the other hand; several recent studies showed that the Voronoi diagrams areextremely efficient in exploring an NN search region; while due to lack of an efficient …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,103
Efficient and anonymous web-usage mining for web personalization,Cyrus Shahabi; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani,The World Wide Web (WWW) is the largest distributed information space and has grown toencompass diverse information resources. Although the web is growing exponentially; theindividual's capacity to read and digest content is essentially fixed. The full economicpotential of the web will not be realized unless enabling technologies are provided tofacilitate access to web resources. Currently web personalization is the most promisingapproach to remedy this problem; and web mining; particularly web-usage mining; isconsidered a crucial component of any efficacious web-personalization system. In thispaper; we describe a complete framework for web-usage mining to satisfy the challengingrequirements of web-personalization applications.

On configuring a single disk continuous media server,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Seon Ho Kim; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract The past decade has witnessed a proliferation of repositories that store and retrievecontinuous media data types; eg; audio and video objects. These repositories are expectedto play a major role in several emerging applications; eg; library information systems;educational applications; entertainment industry; etc. To support the display of a videoobject; the system partitions each object into fixed size blocks. All blocks of an object residepermanently on the disk drive. When displaying an object; the system stages the blocks ofthe object into memory one at a time for immediate display. In the presence of multipledisplays referencing different objects; the bandwidth of the disk drive is multiplexed amongrequests; introducing disk seeks.

SWAM: a family of access methods for similarity-search in peer-to-peer data networks,Farnoush Banaei-Kashani; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Peer-to-peer Data Networks (PDNs) are large-scale; self-organizing; distributedquery processing systems.

Unlike its predecessors; ie; LH* and DHTs; SWAMdoes not control the assignment of data objects to PDN nodes; each node autonomouslystores its own data. Besides; SWAM supports all similarity-search queries on multipleattributes.

Automatically conflating road vector data with orthoimagery,Ching-Chien Chen; Craig A Knoblock; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Recent growth of the geospatial information on the web has made it possible toeasily access a wide variety of spatial data. The ability to combine various sets of geospatialdata into a single composite dataset has been one of central issues of modern geographicinformation processing. By conflating diverse spatial datasets; one can support a rich set ofqueries that could have not been answered given any of these sets in isolation. However;automatically conflating geospatial data from different data sources remains a challengingtask. This is because geospatial data obtained from various data sources may have differentprojections; different accuracy levels and different formats (eg; raster or vector format); thusresulting in various positional inconsistencies. Most of the existing algorithms only deal withvector to vector data conflation or require human intervention to accomplish vector data to …,GeoInformatica,2006,93

Geotrucrowd: trustworthy query answering with spatial crowdsourcing,Leyla Kazemi; Cyrus Shahabi; Lei Chen,Abstract With the abundance and ubiquity of mobile devices; a new class of applications;called spatial crowdsourcing; is emerging; which enables spatial tasks (ie; tasks related to alocation) assigned to and performed by human workers. However; one of the majorchallenges with spatial crowdsourcing is how to verify the validity of the results provided byworkers; when the workers are not trusted equally. To tackle this problem; we assume everyworker has a reputation score; which states the probability that the worker performs a taskcorrectly. Moreover; we define a confidence level for every spatial task; which states that theanswer to the given spatial task is only accepted if its confidence is higher than a certainthreshold. Thus; the problem we are trying to solve is to maximize the number of spatialtasks that are assigned to a set of workers while satisfying the confidence levels of those …,Proceedings of the 21st acm sigspatial international conference on advances in geographic information systems,2013,82
Ebm: an entropy-based model to infer social strength from spatiotemporal data,Huy Pham; Cyrus Shahabi; Yan Liu,Abstract The ubiquity of mobile devices and the popularity of location-based-services havegenerated; for the first time; rich datasets of people's location information at a very highfidelity. These location datasets can be used to study people's behavior-for example; socialstudies have shown that people; who are seen together frequently at the same place and atthe same time; are most probably socially related. In this paper; we are interested in inferringthese social connections by analyzing people's location information; which is useful in avariety of application domains from sales and marketing to intelligence analysis.

In an earlier work; weintroduced a recommendation system; termed Yoda; which employs a hybrid approach thatcombines collaborative filtering (CF) and content-based querying to achieve higheraccuracy for large-scale Web-based applications. To reduce the complexity of the hybridapproach; Yoda is structured as a tunable model that is trained off-line and employed forreal-time recommendation on-line. The on-line process benefits from an optimizedaggregation function with low complexity that allows the real-time aggregation based onconfidence values of an active user to pre-defined sets of recommendations. In this paper;we extend Yoda to include more recommendation sets. The recommendation sets can be …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2003,78
Alternative solutions for continuous k nearest neighbor queries in spatial network databases,Mohammad R Kolahdouzan; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Continuous K nearest neighbor queries (C-KNN) are defined as finding the nearestpoints of interest along an enitre path (eg; finding the three nearest gas stations to a movingcar on any point of a pre-specified path). The result of this type of query is a set of intervals(or split points) and their corresponding KNNs; such that the KNNs of all points within eachinterval are the same. The current studies on C-KNN focus on vector spaces where thedistance between two objects is a function of their spatial attributes (eg; Euclidean distancemetric). These studies are not applicable to spatial network databases (SNDB) where thedistance between two objects is a function of the network connectivity (eg; shortest pathbetween two objects). In this paper; we propose two techniques to address C-KNN queriesin SNDB: Intersection Examination (IE) and Upper Bound Algorithm (UBA). With IE; we …,GeoInformatica,2005,74
Yima: a second-generation continuous media server,Cyrus Shahabi; Roger Zimmermann; Kun Fu; Shu-Yuen Didi Yao,Continuous media data requires a streaming architecture that can manage real-time deliveryconstraints and address the large size of CM objects. Although commercial systemsordinarily use proprietary technology and algorithms; making it difficult to compare theirproducts with research prototypes; the authors have designed and developed Yima; asecond-generation CM server that demonstrates several advanced concepts. Although thissystem has not yet achieved the refinement of commercial solutions; it is operational andincorporates lessons learned from first-generation research prototypes; including completedistribution; efficient online scalability; and synchronization of several media streams withina single frame.

SCADDAR: An efficient randomized technique to reorganize continuous media blocks,Ashish Goel; Cyrus Shahabi; Shu-Yuen Didi Yao; Roger Zimmermann,Scalable storage architectures allow for the addition of disks to increase storage capacityand/or bandwidth. In its general form; disk scaling also refers to disk removals when eithercapacity needs to be conserved or old disk drives are retired. Assuming random placementof blocks on multiple nodes of a continuous media server; our optimization objective is toredistribute a minimum number of media blocks after disk scaling. This objective should bemet under two restrictions. First; uniform distribution and hence a balanced load should beensured after redistribution. Second; the redistributed blocks should be retrieved at thenormal mode of operation in one disk access and through low complexity computation. Wepropose a technique that meets the objective; while we prove that it also satisfies bothrestrictions. The SCADDAR approach is based on using a series of REMAP functions …,Data Engineering; 2002.

The haptic museum,Margaret L McLaughlin; Gaurav Sukhatme; Cyrus Shahabi; Joao Hespanha; Antonio Ortega; Gerard Medioni,Our IMSC team has used haptics to allow museum visitors to explore three-dimensionalworks of art by “touching” them; something that is not possible in ordinary museums due toprevailing “hands-off” policies [1; 2]. Haptics involves the modality of touch--the sensation ofshape and texture an observer feels when exploring a virtual object; such as a three-dimensional model of a piece of pottery or art glass [3; 4; 5].

Pipelining mechanism to minimize the latency time in hierarchical multimedia storage managers,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Ali Dashti; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract An emerging area of database system research is to provide support for continuousmedia data types (digital audio and video). These data types are expected to play a majorrole in applications such as library information systems; scientific databases; entertainmenttechnology; etc. They require both a high volume of storage and a high bandwidthrequirement for their continuous display. The storage organization of systems that supportthese data types is expected to be hierarchical; consisting of one or more tertiary storagedevices; several disk drives; and some memory.

An efficient k nearest neighbor search for multivariate time series,Kiyoung Yang; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Multivariate time series (MTS) datasets are common in various multimedia; medicaland financial applications. In order to efficiently perform k nearest neighbor searches forMTS datasets; we present a similarity measure; Eros (extended Frobenius norm); an indexstructure; Muse (multilevel distance-based index structure for Eros); and a feature subsetselection technique; Ropes (recursive feature elimination on common principal componentsfor Eros).

Most of the existing approaches make the simplifying assumption that travel-times of the network edges are constant. However; with real-world spatial networks the edgetravel-times are time-dependent; where the arrival-time to an edge determines the actualtravel-time on the edge.

Utilizing real-world transportation data for accurate traffic prediction,Bei Pan; Ugur Demiryurek; Cyrus Shahabi,For the first time; real-time high-fidelity spatiotemporal data on transportation networks ofmajor cities have become available. This gold mine of data can be utilized to learn abouttraffic behavior at different times and locations; potentially resulting in major savings in timeand fuel; the two important commodities of 21st century. As a first step towards the utilizationof this data; in this paper; we study the real-world data collected from Los Angeles Countytransportation network in order to incorporate the data's intrinsic behavior into a time-seriesmining technique to enhance its accuracy for traffic prediction. In particular; we utilized thespatiotemporal behaviors of rush hours and events to perform a more accurate prediction ofboth short-term and long-term average speed on road-segments; even in the presence ofinfrequent events (eg; accidents).

Spatial query integrity with voronoi neighbors,Ling Hu; Wei-Shinn Ku; Spiridon Bakiras; Cyrus Shahabi,With the popularity of location-based services and the abundant usage of smart phones andGPS-enabled devices; the necessity of outsourcing spatial data has grown rapidly over thepast few years. Meanwhile; the fast arising trend of cloud storage and cloud computingservices has provided a flexible and cost-effective platform for hosting data from businessesand individuals; further enabling many location-based applications. Nevertheless; in thisdatabase outsourcing paradigm; the authentication of the query results at the client remainsa challenging problem.

Placement of continuous media in multi-zone disks,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Seon Ho Kim; Cyrus Shahabi; Roger Zimmermann,ABSTRACT For applications with large data sets; eg; video servers; magnetic disks haveestablished themselves as the mass storage device of choice. A technique to increase thestorage capacity of disks is zoning. A side-effect of zoning is that it introduces a disk drivewith variable transfer rates. This chapter describes techniques to support a continuousdisplay of constant-bit rate video and audio objects using a multi-zone disk drive. Ascompared to previous approaches; the proposed techniques provide the average transferrate of each magnetic disk (instead of its minimum transfer rate). In addition; we describe aconfiguration planner that logically manipulates the zoning information of a disk drive tosupport the performance criteria of an application. We present performance numbers froman experimental prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.,Multimedia Information Storage and Management,1996,55
Query integrity assurance of location-based services accessing outsourced spatial databases,Wei-Shinn Ku; Ling Hu; Cyrus Shahabi; Haixun Wang,Abstract Outsourcing data to third party data providers is becoming a common practice fordata owners to avoid the cost of managing and maintaining databases. Meanwhile; due tothe popularity of location-based-services (LBS); the need for spatial data (eg; gazetteers;vector data) is increasing exponentially. Consequently; we are witnessing a new trend ofoutsourcing spatial datasets by data collectors. Two main challenges with outsourcingdatasets is to keep the data private (from the data provider) and ensure the integrity of thequery result (for the clients). Unfortunately; most of the techniques proposed for privacy andintegrity do not extend to spatial data in a straightforward manner. Hence; recent studiesproposed various techniques to support either privacy or integrity (but not both) on spatialdatasets.

To utilize the maps for understanding other geospatialsources; one of the most valuable types of information we need from the map is the roadnetwork; because the roads are common features used across different geospatial data sets.Specifically; the set of road intersections of the map provides key information about the roadnetwork; which includes the location of the road junctions; the number of roads that meet atthe intersections (ie; connectivity); and the orientations of these roads. The set of roadintersections helps to identify roads on imagery by serving as initial seed templates to locateroad pixels.

Hybrid indexing and seamless ranking of spatial and textual features of web documents,Ali Khodaei; Cyrus Shahabi; Chen Li,Abstract There is a significant commercial and research interest in location-based websearch engines. Given a number of search keywords and one or more locations that a useris interested in; a location-based web search retrieves and ranks the most textually andspatially relevant web pages. In this type of search; both the spatial and textual informationshould be indexed. Currently; no efficient index structure exists that can handle both thespatial and textual aspects of data simultaneously and accurately. Existing approacheseither index space and text separately or use inefficient hybrid index structures with poorperformance. Moreover; most of these approaches cannot accurately rank web-pages basedon a combination of space and text and are not easy to integrate into existing searchengines.

A server-assigned spatial crowdsourcing framework,Hien To; Cyrus Shahabi; Leyla Kazemi,Abstract With the popularity of mobile devices; spatial crowdsourcing is rising as a newframework that enables human workers to solve tasks in the physical world. With spatialcrowdsourcing; the goal is to crowdsource a set of spatiotemporal tasks (ie; tasks related totime and location) to a set of workers; which requires the workers to physically travel to thoselocations in order to perform the tasks. In this article; we focus on one class of spatialcrowdsourcing; in which the workers send their locations to the server and thereafter theserver assigns to every worker tasks in proximity to the worker's location with the aim ofmaximizing the overall number of assigned tasks.

Change detection in time series data using wavelet footprints,Mehdi Sharifzadeh; Farnaz Azmoodeh; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract In this paper; we propose a novel approach to address the problem of changedetection in time series data. Our approach is based on wavelet footprints proposedoriginally by the signal processing community for signal compression. We; however; exploitthe properties of footprints to capture discontinuities in a signal. We show that transformingdata using footprints generates nonzero coefficients only at the change points. Exploitingthis property; we propose a change detection query processing scheme which employsfootprint-transformed data to identify change points; their amplitudes; and degrees of changeefficiently and accurately.

Efficient k-nearest neighbor search in time-dependent spatial networks,Ugur Demiryurek; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract The class of k Nearest Neighbor (k NN) queries in spatial networks has been widelystudied in the literature. All existing approaches for k NN search in spatial networks assumethat the weight (eg; travel-time) of each edge in the spatial network is constant. However; inreal-world; edge-weights are time-dependent and vary significantly in short durations; henceinvalidating the existing solutions.

SPIRAL: A scalable private information retrieval approach to location privacy,Ali Khoshgozaran; Houtan Shirani-Mehr; Cyrus Shahabi,Protecting users' location information in location-based services; also termed locationprivacy; has recently garnered significant attention due to its importance in satisfying users'privacy concerns when using location-aware services. Several approaches proposed in theliterature blur the user's location in a region by increasing its spatial extent or anonymizingthe user among several other users. Such approaches in nature require users tocommunicate through a trusted anonymizer for all of their queries which can imposeunrealistic overall communication/computation overhead between the server and theanonymizer for users with more stringent privacy requirements. We revisit the locationprivacy problem with the objective of providing significantly more stringent privacyguarantees and propose SPIRAL; a Scalable Private Information Retrieval Approach to …,Mobile Data Management Workshops; 2008.

An experimental study of alternative shape-based image retrieval techniques,Cyrus Shahabi; Maytham Safar,Abstract Besides traditional applications (eg; CAD/CAM and Trademark registry); newmultimedia applications such as structured video; animation; and MPEG-7 standard requirethe storage and management of well-defined objects. These object databases are thenqueried and searched for different purposes. A sample query might be “find all the scenesthat contain a certain object.” Shape of an object is an important feature for image andmultimedia similarity retrievals. Therefore; in this study we focus on shape-based objectretrieval and conduct a comparison study on four of such techniques (ie; Fourier descriptors;grid based; Delaunay triangulation; and our proposed MBC-based methods (eg; MBC-TPVAS)). We measure the effectiveness of the similarity retrieval of the four different shaperepresentation methods in terms of recall and precision.

Management of physical replicas in parallel multimedia information systems,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Multimedia information systems have emerged as an essential component of manyapplication domains ranging from library information systems to entertainment technology.However; most implementations of these systems (based on a workstation) cannot support acontinuous display of multimedia objects and suffer from frequent disruptions and delaystermed hiccups. This is due to the low I/O bandwidth of the current disk technology; the highbandwidth requirement of multimedia objects; and the large size of these objects whichrequires them to be almost always disk resident. One approach to resolve this limitation is todecluster a multimedia object across multiple disk drives in order to employ the aggregatebandwidth of several disks to support its continuous retrieval (and display). To supportsimultaneous display of several multimedia objects for different users; the system can …,International Conference on Foundations of Data Organization and Algorithms,1993,39
Processing spatial skyline queries in both vector spaces and spatial network databases,Mehdi Sharifzadeh; Cyrus Shahabi; Leyla Kazemi,Abstract In this article; we first introduce the concept of Spatial Skyline Queries (SSQ). Givena set of data points P and a set of query points Q; each data point has a number of derivedspatial attributes each of which is the point's distance to a query point. An SSQ retrievesthose points of P which are not dominated by any other point in P considering their derivedspatial attributes. The main difference with the regular skyline query is that this spatialdomination depends on the location of the query points Q. SSQ has application in severaldomains such as emergency response and online maps. The main intuition and noveltybehind our approaches is that we exploit the geometric properties of the SSQ problem spaceto avoid the exhaustive examination of all the point pairs in P and Q. Consequently; wereduce the complexity of SSQ search from O (&verbar; P&verbar; 2 &verbar; Q&verbar;) to …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2009,38
Efficient continuous nearest neighbor query in spatial networks using euclidean restriction,Ugur Demiryurek; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract In this paper; we propose an efficient method to answer continuous k nearestneighbor (C k NN) queries in spatial networks. Assuming a moving query object and a set ofdata objects that make frequent and arbitrary moves on a spatial network with dynamicallychanging edge weights; C k NN continuously monitors the nearest (in network distance)neighboring objects to the query. Previous C k NN methods are inefficient and; hence; fail toscale in large networks with numerous data objects because: 1) they heavily rely on Dijkstra-based blind expansion for network distance computation that incurs excessively redundantcost particularly in large networks; and 2) they blindly map all object location updates to thenetwork disregarding whether the updates are relevant to the C k NN query result. With ourmethod; termed ER-C k NN (short for Euclidian Restriction based C k NN); we utilize ER …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2009,38
Private information retrieval techniques for enabling location privacy in location-based services,Ali Khoshgozaran; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract The ubiquity of smartphones and other location-aware hand-held devices hasresulted in a dramatic increase in popularity of location-based services (LBS) tailored to userlocations. The comfort of LBS comes with a privacy cost. Various distressing privacyviolations caused by sharing sensitive location information with potentially maliciousservices have highlighted the importance of location privacy research aiming to protect userprivacy while interacting with LBS. The anonymity and cloaking-based approachesproposed to address this problem cannot provide stringent privacy guarantees withoutincurring costly computation and communication overhead. Furthermore; they mostly requirea trusted intermediate anonymizer to protect a user's location information during queryprocessing. In this chapter; we review a set of fundamental approaches based on private …,*,2009,38
Forecasting spatiotemporal impact of traffic incidents on road networks,Bei Pan; Ugur Demiryurek; Cyrus Shahabi; Chetan Gupta,The advances in sensor technologies enable real-time collection of high-fidelityspatiotemporal data on transportation networks of major cities. In this paper; using two real-world transportation datasets: 1) incident data and 2) traffic data; we address the problem ofpredicting and quantifying the impact of traffic incidents. Traffic incidents include any non-recurring events on road networks; including accidents; weather hazard; road constructionor work zone closures. By analyzing archived incident data; we classify incidents based ontheir features (eg; time; location; type of incident). Subsequently; we model the impact ofeach incident class on its surrounding traffic by analyzing the archived traffic data at the timeand location of the incidents. Consequently; in real-time; if we observe a similar incident(from real-time incident data); we can predict and quantify its impact on the surrounding …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on,2013,36

Robust time-referenced segmentation of moving object trajectories,Hyunjin Yoon; Cyrus Shahabi,Trajectory segmentation is the process of partitioning a given trajectory into a small numberof homogeneous segments wrt some criteria. Conventional segmentation techniques onlyfocus on the spatial features of the movement and could lead to spatially homogeneoussegments but with presumably dissimilar temporal structures. Furthermore; trajectories couldbe over-segmented in the presence of outliers. In this paper; we propose a family of threetrajectory segmentation methods that takes into account both geospatial and temporalstructures of movement for the segmentation and is also robust with respect to time-referenced spatial outliers. The effectiveness of our methods is empirically demonstratedover three real-world datasets.,Data Mining; 2008. ICDM'08. Eighth IEEE International Conference on,2008,35

SHIFT-SPLIT: I/O efficient maintenance of wavelet-transformed multidimensional data,Mehrdad Jahangiri; Dimitris Sacharidis; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract The Discrete Wavelet Transform is a proven tool for a wide range of databaseapplications. However; despite broad acceptance; some of its properties have not been fullyexplored and thus not exploited; particularly for two common forms of multidimensionaldecomposition. We introduce two novel operations for wavelet transformed data; termedSHIFT and SPLIT; based on the properties of wavelet trees; which work directly in thewavelet domain. We demonstrate their significance and usefulness by analytically provingsix important results in four common data maintenance scenarios; ie; transformation ofmassive datasets; appending data; approximation of data streams and partial datareconstruction; leading to significant I/O cost reduction in all cases. Furthermore; we showhow these operations can be further improved in combination with the optimal coefficient …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,34
Device independence and extensibility in gesture recognition,Jacob Eisenstein; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Leana Golubchik; Cyrus Shahabi; Donghui Yan; Roger Zimmermann,Gesture recognition techniques often suffer from being highly device-dependent and hard toextend. If a system is trained using data from a specific glove input device; that system istypically unusable with any other input device. The set of gestures that a system is trained torecognize is typically not extensible; without retraining the entire system. We propose anovel gesture recognition framework to address these problems. This framework is based ona multi-layered view of gesture recognition. Only the lowest layer is device dependent; itconverts raw sensor values produced by the glove to a glove-independent semanticdescription of the hand. The higher layers of our framework can be reused across gloves;and are easily extensible to include new gestures. We have experimentally evaluated ourframework and found that it yields comparable performance to conventional techniques …,Virtual Reality; 2003. Proceedings. IEEE,2003,34
Decentralized resource management for a distributed continuous media server,Cyrus Shahabi; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani,Distributed continuous media server (DCMS) architectures are proposed to minimize thecommunication-storage cost for those continuous media applications that serve a largenumber of geographically distributed clients. Typically; a DCMS is designed as a purehierarchy of centralized continuous media servers. RedHi; a Redundant Hierarchicaltopology for DCMS networks; can result in higher utilization and better reliability over purehierarchy. We focus on the design of a resource management system (RMS) for RedHi thatcan exploit the resources of its DCMS network to achieve these performance objectives. OurRMS is based on a fully decentralized approach to achieve optimal scalability androbustness. The major drawback of a fully decentralized design is the increase in latencytime and communication overhead to locate the requested object.

Towards preserving privacy in participatory sensing,Leyla Kazemi; Cyrus Shahabi,With the abundance and ubiquity of mobile devices; a new class of applications is emerging;called participatory sensing (PS); where people can contribute data (eg; images; video)collected by their mobile devices to central data servers. However; privacy concerns arebecoming a major impediment in the success of many participatory sensing systems. Whileseveral privacy preserving techniques exist in the context of conventional location-basedservices; they are not directly applicable to the PS systems because of the extra informationthat the PS systems can collect from their participants. In this paper; we formally define theproblem of privacy in PS systems and identify its unique challenges assuming an un-trustedcentral data server model. We propose PiRi; a privacy-aware framework for PS systems;which enables participation of the users without compromising their privacy.,Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PERCOM Workshops); 2011 IEEE International Conference on,2011,33
Verifying spatial queries using Voronoi neighbors,Ling Hu; Wei-Shinn Ku; Spiridon Bakiras; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract With the popularity of location-based services and the abundant usage of smartphones and GPS enabled devices; the necessity of outsourcing spatial data has grownrapidly over the past few years. Nevertheless; in the database outsourcing paradigm; theauthentication of the query results at the client remains a challenging problem. In this paper;we focus on the Outsourced Spatial Database (OSDB) model and propose an efficientscheme; called VN-Auth; that allows a client to verify the correctness and completeness ofthe result set. Our approach can handle both k nearest neighbor (kNN) and range queries;and is based on neighborhood information derived by the Voronoi diagram of the underlyingspatial dataset. Specifically; upon receiving a query result; the client can verify its integrity byexamining the signatures and exploring the neighborhood of every object in the result set …,Proceedings of the 18th SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2010,33
Privacy assurance in mobile sensing networks: go beyond trusted servers,Ling Hu; Cyrus Shahabi,Mobile devices are becoming the largest sensor network around the world. They could beused to collect a large amount of data with little effort and cost which is leading to apromising future for participatory sensing networks or urban sensing. However; privacyconcerns of the mobile users are the major inhibitors hindering massive participation. Thispaper proposes a solution to user privacy preserving problem in a participatory sensingnetwork. Each user is considered as a node in a social network and users are connectedthrough friendship links which are represented as edges on the network. Typically; eachuser contributes to the participatory system by uploading his/her acquired data to a server.Instead of uploading data to the server directly; we devised a Hot-Potato-Privacy-ProtectionAlgorithm (HP 3) in which data is sent to one of the friends of the user and the friend will …,Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PERCOM Workshops); 2010 8th IEEE International Conference on,2010,33
Cle ver: A feature subset selection technique for multivariate time series,Kiyoung Yang; Hyunjin Yoon; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Feature subset selection (FSS) is one of the data pre-processing techniques toidentify a subset of the original features from a given dataset before performing any datamining tasks. We propose a novel FSS method for Multivariate Time Series (MTS) based onCommon Principal Components; termed CL e V er. It utilizes the properties of the principalcomponents to retain the correlation information among original features while traditionalFSS techniques; such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE); may lose it. In order toevaluate the effectiveness of our selected subset of features; classification is employed asthe target data mining task. Our experiments show that CL e V er outperforms RFE andFisher Criterion by up to a factor of two in terms of classification accuracy; while requiring upto 2 orders of magnitude less processing time.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2005,33

Towards modeling the traffic data on road networks,Ugur Demiryurek; Bei Pan; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract A spatiotemporal network is a spatial network (eg; road network) along with thecorresponding time-dependent weight (eg; travel time) for each edge of the network. Thedesign and analysis of policies and plans on spatiotemporal networks (eg; path planning forlocation-based services) require realistic models that accurately represent the temporalbehavior of such networks. In this paper; for the first time we propose a traffic modelingframework for road networks that enables 1) generating an accurate temporal model fromarchived temporal data collected from a spatiotemporal network (so as to be able to publishthe temporal model of the spatiotemporal network without having to release the real data);and 2) augmenting any given spatial network model with a corresponding realistic temporalmodel custom-built for that specific spatial network (in order to be able to generate a …,Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Computational Transportation Science,2009,32
A Reliable; EÆcient; and Scalable System for Web Usage Data Acquisition,Cyrus Shahabi; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani; Jabed Faruque,Abstract Usage data acquisition tier is a necessary component of every Web Usage Mining(WUM) system. For efficacious WUM; the acquisition system must be reliable; efficient;scalable. The usage data are usually obtained from either Web server log; at the server side;or Web browser; at the client side. We argue that usage data acquisition via server log isneither reliable; nor efficient. It is unreliable due to side effects of the network; ie missingcache hits and variable network transfer time; and inefficient because of usage datarequiring extensive preprocessing before it can be utilized. Instead; we propose a client-sidedata acquisition mechanism that entirely eliminates the inaccuracy with data collection; bycollecting the data at the client side; and inefficiency with data acquisition; by avoidingunnecessary preprocessing of the data. We also explain the scalable design of our data …,*,2001,32
On the stationarity of multivariate time series for correlation-based data analysis,Kiyoung Yang; Cyrus Shahabi,Multivariate time series (MTS) data sets are common in-various multimedia; medical andfinancial application domains. These applications perform several data-analysis operationson large number of MTS data sets such as similarity searches; feature-subset-selection;clustering and classifications. Correlation-based techniques; such as principal componentanalysis (PCA); have proven to improve the efficiency of many of the above-mentioned data-analysis operations on MTS; which implies that the correlation coefficients conciselyrepresent the original MTS data. However; if the statistical properties (eg; variance) of MTSdata change over time dimension; ie; MTS data is non-stationary; the correlation coefficientsare not stable. In this paper; we propose to utilize the stationarity of the MTS data sets; inorder to represent the original MTS data more stably; as well as concisely with the …,Data Mining; Fifth IEEE International Conference on,2005,31

Ateach step of the computation; ProPolyne makes the best possible wavelet approximation ofthe submitted query. The result is a data-independent approximate query answeringtechnique which uses data structures that can be maintained efficiently.

Authentication of k nearest neighbor query on road networks,Yinan Jing; Ling Hu; Wei-Shinn Ku; Cyrus Shahabi,Outsourcing spatial databases to the cloud provides an economical and flexible way for dataowners to deliver spatial data to users of location-based services. However; in the databaseoutsourcing paradigm; the third-party service provider is not always trustworthy; therefore;ensuring spatial query integrity is critical. In this paper; we propose an efficient road networkk-nearest-neighbor query verification technique which utilizes the network Voronoi diagramand neighbors to prove the integrity of query results. Unlike previous work that verifies k-nearest-neighbor results in the Euclidean space; our approach needs to verify both thedistances and the shortest paths from the query point to its kNN results on the road network.We evaluate our approach on real-world road networks together with both real and syntheticpoints of interest datasets.

Towards k-nearest neighbor search in time-dependent spatial network databases,Ugur Demiryurek; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract The class of k Nearest Neighbor (k NN) queries in spatial networks is extensivelystudied in the context of numerous applications. In this paper; for the first time we study ageneralized form of this problem; called the Time-Dependent k Nearest Neighbor problem(TD-k NN) with which edge-weights are time variable. All existing approaches for k NNsearch assume that the weight (eg; travel-time) of each edge of the spatial network isconstant. However; in real-world edge-weights are time-dependent (ie; the arrival-time to anedge determines the actual travel-time on that edge) and vary significantly in short durations.We study the applicability of two baseline solutions for TD-k NN and compare their efficiencyvia extensive experimental evaluations with real-world data-sets; including a variety of largespatial networks with real traffic-data recordings.,International Workshop on Databases in Networked Information Systems,2010,28

Butgestures are an easy mean of expression between humans that could be used tocommunicate with computers in a more natural manner. Most of the current research onhand gesture recognition for Human-Computer Interaction rely on either the NeuralNetworks or Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).

A probe-based technique to optimize join queries in distributed internet databases,Cyrus Shahabi; Latifur Khan; Dennis McLeod,Abstract. An adaptive probe-based optimization technique is developed and demonstratedin the context of an Internet-based distributed database environment. More and morecommon are database systems which are distributed across servers communicating via theInternet where a query at a given site might require data from remote sites. Optimizing theresponse time of such queries is a challenging task due to the unpredictability of serverperformance and network traffic at the time of data shipment; this may result in the selectionof an expensive query plan using a static query optimizer. We constructed an experimentalsetup consisting of two servers running the same database management system connectedvia the Internet. Concentrating on join queries; we demonstrate how a static query optimizermight choose an expensive plan by mistake. This is due to the lack of a priori knowledge …,Knowledge and information systems,2000,27

Efficient algorithms and cost models for reverse spatial-keyword k-nearest neighbor search,Ying Lu; Jiaheng Lu; Gao Cong; Wei Wu; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Geographic objects associated with descriptive texts are becoming prevalent;justifying the need for spatial-keyword queries that consider both locations and textualdescriptions of the objects. Specifically; the relevance of an object to a query is measured byspatial-textual similarity that is based on both spatial proximity and textual similarity. In thisarticle; we introduce the Reverse Spatial-Keyword k-Nearest Neighbor (RSKkNN) query;which finds those objects that have the query as one of their k-nearest spatial-textualobjects. The RSKkNN queries have numerous applications in online maps and GIS decisionsupport systems.

Indexing land surface for efficient knn query,Cyrus Shahabi; Lu-An Tang; Songhua Xing,Abstract The class of k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) queries is frequently used in geospatialapplications. Many studies focus on processing kNN in Euclidean and road network spaces.Meanwhile; with the recent advances in remote sensory devices that can acquire detailedelevation data; the new geospatial applications heavily operate on this third dimension; ie;land surface. Hence; for the field of databases to stay relevant; it should be able to efficientlyprocess spatial queries given this constrained third dimension. However; online processingof the surface k Nearest Neighbor (skNN) queries is quite challenging due to the huge sizeof land surface models which renders any accurate distance computation on the surfaceextremely slow. In this paper; for the first time; we propose an index structure on land surfacethat enables exact and fast responses to skNN queries. Two complementary indexing …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,26
A multilevel distance-based index structure for multivariate time series,Kiyoung Yang; Cyrus Shahabi,Multivariate time series (MTS) datasets are common in various multimedia; medical andfinancial applications. In previous work; we introduced a similarity measure for MTSdatasets; termed Eros (extended Frobenius norm); which is based on the Frobenius normand principal component analysis (PCA). Eros computes the similarity between two MTSitems by measuring how close the corresponding principal components (PCs) are using theeigenvalues as weights. Since the weights are based on the data items in the database; theychange whenever data are inserted into or removed from the database. In this paper; wepropose a distance-based index structure; Muse (Multilevel distance-based index structurefor Eros); for efficient retrieval of MTS items using Eros. Muse constructs each level as adistance-based index structure without using the weights; up to z levels. At the query time …,Temporal Representation and Reasoning; 2005.

Energy-efficient data organization and query processing in sensor networks,Ramakrishna Gummadi; Xin Li; Ramesh Govindan; Cyrus Shahabi; Wei Hong,Abstract Recent sensor networks research has produced a class of data storage and queryprocessing techniques called Data-Centric Storage that leverages locality-preservingdistributed indexes to efficiently answer multi-dimensional range and range-aggregatequeries. These distributed indexes offer a rich design space of a) logical decompositions ofsensor relation schema into indexes; as well as b) physical mappings of these indexes ontosensors. In this paper; we discuss this space for energy-efficient data organizations (logicaland physical mappings of tuples and attributes to sensor nodes) and examine theperformance of purely local query optimization techniques for processing queries that spansuch decomposed relations.-,ACM SIGBED Review,2005,26
Real-time task assignment in hyperlocal spatial crowdsourcing under budget constraints,Hien To; Liyue Fan; Luan Tran; Cyrus Shahabi,Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) is a novel platform that engages individuals in the act ofcollecting various types of spatial data. This method of data collection can significantlyreduce cost and turnover time; and is particularly useful in environmental sensing; wheretraditional means fail to provide fine-grained field data. In this study; we introduce hyperlocalspatial crowdsourcing; where all workers who are located within the spatiotemporal vicinityof a task are eligible to perform the task; eg; reporting the precipitation level at their area andtime. In this setting; there is often a budget constraint; either for every time period or for theentire campaign; on the number of workers to activate to perform tasks. The challenge isthus to maximize the number of assigned tasks under the budget constraint; despite thedynamic arrivals of workers and tasks as well as their co-location relationship. We study …,Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom); 2016 IEEE International Conference on,2016,25
Precisely locating features on geospatial imagery,*,Methods for locating a feature on geospatial imagery and systems for performing thosemethods are disclosed. An accuracy level of each of a plurality of geospatial vector datasetsavailable in a database can be determined. Each of the plurality of geospatial vectordatasets corresponds to the same spatial region as the geospatial imagery. The geospatialvector dataset having the highest accuracy level may be selected. When the selectedgeospatial vector dataset and the geospatial imagery are misaligned; the selectedgeospatial vector dataset is aligned to the geospatial imagery. The location of the feature onthe geospatial imagery is then determined based on the selected geospatial vector datasetand outputted via a display device.,*,2014,25
Utilizing Road Network Data for Automatic Identification of Road Intersections from High Resolution Color Orthoimagery.,Ching-Chien Chen; Cyrus Shahabi; Craig A Knoblock,Abstract Recent growth of the geo-spatial information on the web has made it possible toeasily access various and high quality geo-spatial datasets; such as road networks and highresolution imagery. Although there exist efficient methods to locate road intersections fromroad networks for route planning; there are few research activities on detecting roadintersections from orthoimagery. Detected road intersections on imagery can be utilized forconflation; cityplanning and other GIS-related applications. In this paper; we describe anapproach to automatically and accurately identifying road intersections from high resolutioncolor orthoimagery. We exploit image metadata as well as the color of imagery to classify theimage pixels as on-road/off-road. Using these chromatically classified image pixels as input;we locate intersections on the images by utilizing the knowledge inferred from the road …,STDBM,2004,25
Towards a generic framework for trustworthy spatial crowdsourcing,Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Many studies foresee significant future growth in the number of mobile smart phoneusers; the phone's hardware and software features; and the broadband bandwidth.Therefore; a transformative area of research is to fully utilize this new platform for varioustasks; among which the most promising is spatial crowdsourcing. Spatial crowdsourcing(SC) engages individuals; groups; and communities in the act of collecting; analyzing; anddisseminating urban; social; and other spatiotemporal information. This new paradigm ofdata collection has shown to be useful when traditional means fail (eg; due to disaster); arecensored or do not scale in time and space. Two major impediments to the success ofspatial crowdsourcing in real-world applications are scalability and trust issues. Withoutscale considerations; it is impossible to develop a generic multi-campaign spatial …,Proceedings of the 12th International ACM Workshop on Data Engineering for Wireless and Mobile Acess,2013,24
A query integrity assurance scheme for accessing outsourced spatial databases,Wei-Shinn Ku; Ling Hu; Cyrus Shahabi; Haixun Wang,Abstract With the trend of cloud computing; outsourcing databases to third party serviceproviders is becoming a common practice for data owners to decrease the cost of managingand maintaining databases in-house. In conjunction; due to the popularity of location-based-services (LBS); the need for spatial data (eg; gazetteers; vector data) is increasingdramatically. Consequently; there is a noticeably new tendency of outsourcing spatialdatasets by data collectors. Two main challenges with outsourcing datasets are to keep thedata private (from the data provider) and to ensure the integrity of the query result (for theclients). Unfortunately; most of the techniques proposed for privacy and integrity do notextend to spatial data in a straightforward manner. Hence; recent studies proposed varioustechniques to support either privacy or integrity (but not both) on spatial datasets. In this …,Geoinformatica,2013,24
INSITE: A tool for real-time knowledge discovery from users web navigation,Cyrus Shahabi; Adil Faisal; Farnoush Banaei Kashani; Jabed Faruque,Abstract The major challenges in web mining are a) tracking the data accurately (as noteverything is reported to the web server); b) real-time acquisition of the huge volume of data(435 Million visits to yahoo per day; 2-4 GB clickstream data per hour); c) real-timeinterpretation of the data without compromising the privacy of the user (order of seconds forpersonalization and targeting information); and d) visualization of the data to facilitate policymaking. To address these challenges; we demonstrate an integrated software platform;called INSITE–a) to accurately track users interactions with a web space with minimumoverhead and no voluntary user participation; b) to generate individual and aggregate userprofiles in real time (or off-line) through the use of a unique Connectivity Matrix Model (CM-model); c) to show the efficacy and scalability of the CM-model in capturing the essence …,PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON VERY LARGE DATA BASES,2000,24

A novel aspect of immersive environments is the new data types thatneed to be supported. In this report we present our experience with three new data types:haptic; avatar; and application coordination data. These data types have a unique set ofcharacteristics that results in new challenges for their acquisition; analysis; content-basedquerying; and integration requirements associated with data-intensive immersivecollaboration (eg; scalability; synchronization; and cross-analysis needs).

A redundant hierarchical structure for a distributed continuous media server,Cyrus Shahabi; Mohammad H Alshayeji; Shimeng Wang,Abstract The growing number of digital audio and video repositories has resulted in adesperate need for effective techniques to deliver data to users in a timely manner. Due togeographical distribution of users; it is not cost effective to have a centralized media server.In this paper; we investigate issues involved in the design of a distributed video server (DVS)to support movie-on-demand (MOD) application. We propose a redundant hierarchical(RedHi) architecture for DVS where the nodes are continuous media servers and the edgesare dedicated network lines. With RedHi; each node has two or more parents. We show thatthe redundant links in RedHi yield a more reliable and efficient system. Our simulationresults demonstrate that RedHi can tolerate a single link failure with no degradation inperformance while with pure hierarchy almost 2.5% of requests are rejected due to the …,International Workshop on Interactive Distributed Multimedia Systems and Telecommunication Services,1997,24
Utilizing voronoi cells of location data streams for accurate computation of aggregate functions in sensor networks,Mehdi Sharifzadeh; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Sensor networks are unattended deeply distributed systems whose databaseschema can be conceptualized using the relational model. Aggregation queries on the datasampled at each sensor node are the main means to extract the abstract characteristics ofthe surrounding environment. However; the non-uniform distribution of the sensor nodes inthe environment leads to inaccurate results generated by the aggregation queries. In thispaper; we introduce “spatial aggregations” that take into consideration the spatial location ofeach measurement generated by the sensor nodes. We propose the use of spatialinterpolation methods derived from the fields of spatial statistics and computational geometryto answer spatial aggregations. In particular; we study Spatial Moving Average (SMA);Voronoi Diagram and Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN). Investigating these methods …,GeoInformatica,2006,23
Alternative techniques for the efficient acquisition of haptic data,Cyrus Shahabi; Mohammad R Kolahdouzan; Greg Barish; Roger Zimmermann; Didi Yao; Kun Fu; Lingling Zhang,Abstract Immersive environments are those that surround users in an artificial world. Theseenvironments consist of a composition of various types of immersidata: unique data typesthat are combined to render a virtual experience. Acquisition; for storage and futurequerying; of information describing sessions in these environments is challenging becauseof the real-time demands and sizeable amounts of data to be managed. In this paper; wesummarize a comparison of techniques for achieving the efficient acquisition of one type ofimmersidata; the haptic data type; which describes the movement; rotation; and forceassociated with user-directed objects in an immersive environment. In addition to describinga general process for real-time sampling and recording of this type of data; we propose threedistinct sampling strategies: fixed; grouped; and adaptive.

PrivGeoCrowd: A toolbox for studying private spatial crowdsourcing,Hien To; Gabriel Ghinita; Cyrus Shahabi,Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) is a novel and transformative platform that engages individuals;groups and communities in the act of collecting; analyzing; and disseminatingenvironmental; social and other spatio-temporal information. SC outsources a set of spatio-temporal tasks to a set of workers; ie; individuals with mobile devices that perform the tasksby physically traveling to specified locations of interest. Protecting location privacy is animportant concern in SC; as an adversary with access to individual whereabouts can infersensitive details about a person (eg; health status; political views). Due to the challengingnature of protecting worker privacy in SC; solutions for this problem are quite complex; andrequire tuning of several parameters to obtain satisfactory results.

A pca-based kernel for kernel pca on multivariate time series,Kiyoung Yang; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Multivariate time series (MTS) data sets are common in various multimedia; medicaland financial application domains. These applications perform several data-analysisoperations on large number of MTS data sets such as similarity searches; feature-subset-selection; clustering and classification. Inherently; an MTS item has a large number ofdimensions. Hence; before applying data mining techniques; some form of dimensionreduction; eg; feature extraction; should be performed. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)is one of the techniques that have been frequently utilized for dimension reduction.However; traditional PCA does not scale well in terms of dimensionality; and therefore maynot be applied to MTS data sets. The Kernel PCA technique addresses this problem ofscalability by utilizing the kernel trick. In this paper; we propose a PCA based kernel to be …,Proceedings of ICDM 2005 workshop on temporal data mining: algorithms; theory and applications held in conjunction with the fifth IEEE international conference on data mining (ICDM’05),2005,22
Efficient retrieval and spatial querying of 2D objects,C Sbahabi; Maytham Safar,Besides traditional applications (eg; CAD/CAM and Trademark registry); new multimediaapplications such as structured video; animation and MPEG-4 standard require the storageand management of well-defined objects. For efficient retrieval of 2D objects by shape; wepropose three index structures on features that are extracted from the objects' minimumbounding circles (MBC). A major observation is that those features are unique per objectand can be utilized to filter out non-similar candidates. To evaluate our techniques; weconducted a simulation study on a database of 2D objects. The results show the superiorityof our techniques as compared to a naive indexing (at least 40% improvement in I/O cost).We also identify one of the indexing structures as the superior one; independent of the sizeof the database and the number of vertices of the objects.,Multimedia Computing and Systems; 1999.

Accurate discovery of valid convoys from moving object trajectories,Hyunjin Yoon; Cyrus Shahabi,Given a set of moving object trajectories; it is of interest to find a group of objects; called aconvoy; that are spatially density-connected for a certain duration of time. However; existingconvoy discovery algorithms have a critical problem of accuracy; they tend to both misslarger convoys and retrieve invalid ones where the density-connectivity among the objects isnot completely satisfied. We propose a new valid convoy discovery algorithm; calledVCoDA; for the accurate discovery of valid convoys from moving object trajectories.Specifically; VCoDA first retrieves all partially connected convoys while guaranteeing nofalse dismissal of any valid convoys and then validates their density-connectivity toeventually obtain a complete set of valid convoys. Our extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique; VCoDA improves the …,Data Mining Workshops; 2009. ICDMW'09.

Neural-network based sensitivity analysis for injector-producer relationship identification,Ugur Demiryurek; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani; Cyrus Shahabi; Frank G Wilkinson,Abstract Determining injector-producer relationships; ie; to quantify the inter-wellconnectivity between injectors and producers in a reservoir; is a complex and non-stationaryproblem. In this paper; we present a neural-network-based sensitivity analysis approach toaddress this problem. To the best of our knowledge; sensitivity analysis has never beenapplied for identification of the injector-producer relationships; yet we show that it is anintuitive while fundamental approach to address this problem. Sensitivity analysis is basedon a theory with which the functioning of a closed system is derived by analyzing thederivatives of the output with respect to each input combination. For the injector-producerrelationship identification problem; we use sensitivity analysis to determine the injector-producer relationships by varying the injection rates; ie; the inputs to a trained neural …,Intelligent Energy Conference and Exhibition,2008,21

Super-streaming: A new object delivery paradigm for continuous media servers,Cyrus Shahabi; Mohammad H Alshayeji,Abstract A number of studies have focused on the design of continuous media; CM;(eg;video and audio) servers to support the real-time delivery of CM objects. These systemshave been deployed in local environments such as hotels; hospitals and cruise ships tosupport media-on-demand applications. They typically stream CM objects to the clients withthe objective of minimizing the buffer space required at the client site. This objective can nowbe relaxed due to the availability of inexpensive storage devices at the client side. Therefore;we propose a Super-streaming paradigm that can utilize the client side resources in order toimprove the utilization of the CM server. To support super-streaming; we propose atechnique to enable the CM servers to deliver CM objects at a rate higher than their displaybandwidth requirement. We also propose alternative admission control policies to …,*,2000,21

Various distressing privacy violations causedby sharing sensitive location information with potentially malicious services have highlightedthe importance of location privacy research aiming to protect users' privacy while interactingwith LBS.

On scheduling atomic and composite continuous media objects,Cyrus Shahabi; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Surajit Chaudhuri,In multiuser multimedia information systems (eg; movie-on-demand; digital-editing);scheduling the retrievals of continuous media objects becomes a challenging task. This isbecause of both intra and inter lobject time dependencies. Intraobject time dependencyrefers to the real-time display requirement of a continuous media object. Interobject timedependency is the temporal relationships defined among multiple continuous media objects.In order to compose tailored multimedia presentations; a user might define complex timedependencies among multiple continuous media objects with various lengths and displaybandwidths. Scheduling the retrieval tasks corresponding to the components of such apresentation in order to respect both inter and intra task time dependencies is the focus ofthis study. To tackle this task scheduling problem (CRS); we start with a simpler …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2002,20

Task matching and scheduling for multiple workers in spatial crowdsourcing,Dingxiong Deng; Cyrus Shahabi; Linhong Zhu,Abstract A new platform; termed spatial crowdsourcing; is emerging which enables arequester to commission workers to physically travel to some specified locations to perform aset of spatial tasks (ie; tasks related to a geographical location and time). The currentapproach is to formulate spatial crowdsourcing as a matching problem between tasks andworkers; hence the primary objective of the existing solutions is to maximize the number ofmatched tasks. Our goal is to solve the spatial crowdsourcing problem in the presence ofmultiple workers where we optimize for both travel cost and the number of completed tasks;while taking the tasks' expiration times into consideration. The challenge is that the solutionshould be a mixture of task-matching and task-scheduling; which are fundamentallydifferent.

All existing techniques; however;assume a static environment; limiting their utility in emerging applications (eg; Location-based Services) where objects move. In this paper; for the first time; we propose two exactmethods that can continuously answer skNN queries in a highly dynamic environment whichallows for arbitrary movements of data objects. The first method; inspired by the existingtechniques in monitoring kNN in road networks [7] maintains an analogous counterpart of …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,19
An algorithmic approach for static and dynamic gesture recognition utilising mechanical and biomechanical characteristics,Farid Parvini; Cyrus Shahabi,We propose a novel approach for recognising static and dynamic hand gestures byanalysing the raw data streams generated by the sensors attached to the human hands. Weutilise the concept of'range of motion'in the movement of fingers and exploit thischaracteristic to analyse the acquired data for recognising hand signs. Our approach forhand gesture recognition addresses two major problems: user-dependency and device-dependency. Furthermore; we show that our approach neither requires calibration norinvolves training. We apply our approach for recognising American Sign Language (ASL)signs and show that more than 75% accuracy in sign recognition can be achieved.,International journal of bioinformatics research and applications,2006,19

Analysis of data from a study of an educational computer game that we aredeveloping shows that this approach is an effective way to pinpoint potential usability ordesign problems occurring in unfolding situational and episodic events that can interrupt orbreak user experience. As well as informing redesign; a key advantage of this cost-effectiveapproach is that it considerably reduces the time evaluators spend analyzing hours ofvideoed study material.,CHI'05 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2005,19
Feature matrices: A model for efficient and anonymous web usage mining,Cyrus Shahabi; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani; Jabed Faruque; Adil Faisal,Abstract Recent growth of startup companies in the area of Web Usage Mining is a strongindication of the effectiveness of this data in understanding user behaviors. However; theapproach taken by industry towards Web Usage Mining is off-line and hence intrusive; static;and cannot differentiate between various roles a single user might play. Towards this end;several researchers studied probabilistic and distance-based models to summarize thecollected data and maintain only the important features for analysis. The proposed modelsare either not flexible to trade-off accuracy for performance per application requirements; ornot adaptable in real-time due to high complexity of updating the model. In this paper; wepropose a new model; the FM model; which is flexible; tunable; adaptable; and can be usedfor both anonymous and online analysis.

Continuous display of presentations sharing clips,Cyrus Shahabi; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract Databases were introduced to remove redundancy from conventional file systemsand encourage sharing; which resulted in update anomalies when information wasmodified. With presentations (movies) sharing clips (sequence of frames); continuousdisplay becomes challenging as well. Continuous display requires the system to retrieve theinformation with no disruptions or delays (hiccups) once a display is initiated. To ensure acontinuous display using a multi-disk hardware platform; a video object is striped intosubobjects. The system enforces a regular schedule on retrieval of each subobject bycontrolling the placement of the subobjects across the disks. Now if different presentationsshare subobjects; each presentation will enforce its own restrictions on the placement of thedata; resulting in an irregular schedule.

Differentially private location protection for worker datasets in spatial crowdsourcing,Hien To; Gabriel Ghinita; Liyue Fan; Cyrus Shahabi,Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) is a transformative platform that engages individuals incollecting and analyzing environmental; social; and other spatio-temporal information.

Approximate voronoi cell computation on spatial data streams,Mehdi Sharifzadeh; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Several studies have exploited the properties of Voronoi diagrams to improve theefficiency of variations of the nearest neighbor search on stored datasets. However; thesignificance of Voronoi diagrams and their basic building blocks; Voronoi cells; has beenneglected when the geometry data is incrementally becoming available as a data stream. Inthis paper; we study the problem of Voronoi cell computation for fixed 2-d site points whenthe locations of the neighboring sites arrive as a spatial data stream. We show that the non-streaming solution to the problem does not meet the memory requirements of many realisticscenarios over a sliding window. Hence; we propose AVC-SW; an approximate streamingalgorithm that computes (1+ ε)-approximations to the actual exact Voronoi cell in O (κ) whereκ is its sample size. With the sliding window model and random arrival of points; we show …,The VLDB Journal,2009,18

Hash-based labeling techniques for storage scaling,Shu-Yuen D Yao; Cyrus Shahabi; Per-Åke Larson,Abstract. Scalable storage architectures allow for the addition or removal of storage devicesto increase storage capacity and bandwidth or retire older devices. Assuming randomplacement of data objects across multiple storage devices of a storage pool; our optimizationobjective is to redistribute a minimum number of objects after scaling the pool. In addition; auniform distribution; and hence a balanced load; should be ensured after redistribution.Moreover; the redistributed objects should be retrieved efficiently during the normal mode ofoperation: in one I/O access and with low complexity computation. To achieve this; wepropose an algorithm called random disk labeling (RDL); based on double hashing; wherestorage can be added or removed without any increase in complexity. We compare RDLwith other proposed techniques and demonstrate its effectiveness through …,The VLDB journal,2005,18
How to evaluate multiple range-sum queries progressively,Rolfe R Schmidt; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Users of decision support system typically submit batches of range-sum queriessimultaneously rather than issuing individual; unrelated queries. We propose a waveletbased technique that exploits T/O sharing across a query batch to evaluate the set of queriesprogressively and efficiently. The challenge is that now controlling the structure of errorsacross query results becomes more critical than minimizing error per individual query.Consequently; we define a class of structural error penalty functions and show how they arecontrolled by our technique Experiments demonstrate that our technique is efficient as anexact algorithm; and the progressive estimates are accurate; even after less than one I/O perquery.,Proceedings of the twenty-first ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2002,18

In addition; alternative users may classify objects differently due to subjectivityof human perception on multimedia objects. In order to remedy for this situation; we proposea unified model that captures both conventional techniques and soft memberships. Weimplemented the model by extending the traditional database query capabilities such thatthe result of a query depends on the user who submits the query. We compared ourproposed system with conventional image retrieval systems and observed a significantmargin of improvement in matching the user expectations.,Internet Imaging,1999,18
2D topological and direction relations in the world of minimum bounding circles,Maytham Safar; Cyrus Shahabi,The representation and processing of spatial queries is important in numerous applicationdomains in the areas of computer-aided design; multimedia databases; spatial andgeographic applications. A sample query type in these applications is to find objects thatsatisfy a specific direction or topological relation with respect to a given object. Due to thelarge size of these databases and the complexity of geometric algorithms; appropriateindexing techniques and object approximations are crucial. The problem is that therelationships between object approximations are usually a superset of the actualrelationships between their corresponding objects; resulting in a number of false hits. Achallenge; hence; is to reduce the number of false hits in order to decrease the number oftimes we invoke the complex geometric algorithms on the actual representations of the …,Database Engineering and Applications; 1999.

Janus-multi source event detection and collection system for effective surveillance of criminal activity,Cyrus Shahabi; Seon Ho Kim; Luciano Nocera; Giorgos Constantinou; Ying Lu; Yinghao Cai; Gérard Medioni; Ramakant Nevatia; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani,Abstract Recent technological advances provide the opportunity to use large amounts ofmultimedia data from a multitude of sensors with different modalities (eg; video; text) for thedetection and characterization of criminal activity. Their integration can compensate forsensor and modality deficiencies by using data from other available sensors and modalities.However; building such an integrated system at the scale of neighborhood and cities ischallenging due to the large amount of data to be considered and the need to ensure a shortresponse time to potential criminal activity. In this paper; we present a system that enablesmulti-modal data collection at scale and automates the detection of events of interest for thesurveillance and reconnaissance of criminal activity.

Graph-based informative-sentence selection for opinion summarization,Linhong Zhu; Sheng Gao; Sinno Jialin Pan; Haizhou Li; Dingxiong Deng; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract In this paper; we propose a new framework for opinion summarization based onsentence selection. Our goal is to assist users to get helpful opinion suggestions fromreviews by only reading a short summary with few informative sentences; where the qualityof summary is evaluated in terms of both aspect coverage and viewpoints preservation.More specifically; we formulate the informative-sentence selection problem in opinionsummarization as a community-leader detection problem; where a community consists of acluster of sentences towards the same aspect of an entity. The detected leaders of thecommunities can be considered as the most informative sentences of the correspondingaspect; while informativeness of a sentence is defined by its informativeness within both itscommunity and the document it belongs to.

Efficient reachability query evaluation in large spatiotemporal contact datasets,Houtan Shirani-Mehr; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract With the advent of reliable positioning technologies and prevalence of location-based services; it is now feasible to accurately study the propagation of items such asinfectious viruses; sensitive information pieces; and malwares through a population ofmoving objects; eg; individuals; mobile devices; and vehicles. In such application scenarios;an item passes between two objects when the objects are sufficiently close (ie; when theyare; so-called; in contact); and hence once an item is initiated; it can penetrate the objectpopulation through the evolving network of contacts among objects; termed contact network.In this paper; for the first time we define and study reachability queries in large (ie; disk-resident) contact datasets which record the movement of a (potentially large) set of objectsmoving in a spatial environment over an extended time period.

Modelling P2P data networks under complex system theory,Cyrus Shahabi; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani,A Peer-to-peer Data Network (PDN) is an open and evolving society of peer nodes thatassemble into a network to share their data. We argue that with a self-organising; dynamic;and large-scale architecture; instead of traditional distributed computing systems; PDNsshould be classified with natural complex systems (such as social networks). The'complexsystem theory'is a meta-theory that provides a common modelling framework to study suchcomplex systems under one umbrella. In this paper; for the first time we introduce and applythe complex system theory as a modelling framework to study PDNs.,International Journal of Computational Science and Engineering,2007,17
Shape analysis and retrieval of multimedia objects,Maytham H Safar,Abstract Several applications in the areas of multimedia systems and computer graphicsrequire to store and access large databases of images. Images are usually composed of 2Dobjects that contain many features (eg; color; texture; shape; etc.) that have meaningfulsemantics. Among those; shape is an important feature that conforms to the way humanbeings interpret and interact with the real world objects. The shape representation of objectscan therefore be used for their indexing; retrieval; and as a similarity measure. This chapterdescribes diferent image shape features that are used by the different shape representationtechniques. Those features are used for organizing the useful shape information in indexstructures. In addition; we describe various methods for shape representation; and themultidimensional index structures that can be used to support shape retrieval queries …,*,2004,17
Retransmission-based error control in a many-to-many client-server environment,Roger Zimmerman; Kun Fu; Nitin Nahata; Cyrus Shahabi,Large-scale continuous media (CM) system implementations require scalable servers mostlikely built from clusters of storage nodes. Across such nodes random data placement is anattractive alternative to the traditional round-robin striping. One benefit of random placementis that additional nodes can be added with low data-redistribution overhead such that thesystem remains load balanced. One of the challenges in this environment is theimplementation of a retransmission-based error control (RBEC) technique. Because data israndomly placed; a client may not know which server node to ask for a lost packetretransmission. We have designed and implemented a RBEC technique that utilizes thebenefits of random data placement in a cluster server environment while allowing a client toefficiently identify the correct server node for lost packet requests. We have implemented …,Multimedia Computing and Networking 2003,2003,17
An adaptive probe-based technique to optimize join queries in distributed internet databases,Latifur Khan; Dennis Mcleod; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract An adaptive probe-based optimization technique is developed and demonstrated inthe context of an Internet-based distributed database environment. More and more commonare database systems; which are distributed across servers communicating via the Internetwhere a query at a given site might require data from remote sites. Optimizing the responsetime of such queries is a challenging task due to the unpredictability of server performanceand network traffic at the time of data shipment; this may result in the selection of anexpensive query plan using a static query optimizer. We constructed an experimental setupconsisting of two servers running the same DBMS connected via the Internet. Concentratingon join queries; we demonstrate how a static query optimizer might choose an expensiveplan by mistake. This is due to the lack of a priori knowledge of the run-time environment …,*,2002,17
2d TSA-tree: A wavelet-based approach to improve the efficiency of multi-level spatial data mining,Cyrus Shahabi; Seokkyung Chung; Maytham Safar; George Hajj,Due to the large amount of the collected scientific data; it is becoming increasingly difficultfor scientists to comprehend and interpret the available data. Moreover typical queries onthese data sets are in the nature of identifying (or visualizing) trends and surprises at aselected sub-region in multiple levels of abstraction rather than identifying information abouta specific data point. The authors propose a versatile wavelet-based data structure; 2D TSA-tree (Trend and Surprise Abstractions Tree); to enable efficient multi-level trend detection onspatial data at different levels. We show how 2D TSA-tree can be utilized efficiently for sub-region selections. Moreover; 2D TSA-tree can be utilized to precompute the reconstructionerror and retrieval time of a data subset in advance in order to allow the user to trade offaccuracy for response time (or vice versa) at query time.

An arc orienteering algorithm to find the most scenic path on a large-scale road network,Ying Lu; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Traditional route planning problems mainly focus on finding the shortest pathconsidering the travel distance or time. In this paper; we aim to find the most scenic path thatoffers the most beautiful sceneries on the arcs of a path while the total travel cost (distanceor time) is within a user-specified budget. This is a challenging problem as the optimizationobjective is to maximize the value of the path (ie; its scenic value) instead of minimizing itscost (distance or time). The problem can be formulated as a variant of the Arc OrienteeringProblem (AOP); which is a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. Due tothe fast response-time requirements of interactive mobile and online applications (eg; within300 milliseconds) and the large scale of real-world road networks; existing heuristicalgorithms for AOP fail to solve the most scenic road problem. Therefore; unlike the …,Proceedings of the 23rd SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2015,16
Enforcing k nearest neighbor query integrity on road networks,Ling Hu; Yinan Jing; Wei-Shinn Ku; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Outsourcing spatial databases; including both road networks and points of interest;to a third party Cloud service provider has attracted much attention from individual andbusiness data owners. With popularity of mobile devices; providing instant and reliablelocation-based services to smartphones and tablets has been a major means of deliveringspatial data to real-world users. Therefore; ensuring spatial query integrity in databaseoutsourcing paradigms is critical. In this paper; we propose a novel road network k-nearest-neighbor query verification technique which utilizes the network Voronoi diagrams andneighbors to prove the integrity of the query result. Unlike previous work that verifies k-nearest-neighbor results in the Euclidean space; our approach verifies both the distancesand the shortest paths from the query point to its kNN result on the road network.,Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2012,16
Indexing network voronoi diagrams,Ugur Demiryurek; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract The Network Voronoi diagram and its variants have been extensively used in thecontext of numerous applications in road networks; particularly to efficiently evaluate variousspatial proximity queries such as k nearest neighbor (kNN); reverse kNN; and closest pair.Although the existing approaches successfully utilize the network Voronoi diagram as a wayto partition the space for their specific problems; there is little emphasis on how to efficientlyfind and access the network Voronoi cell containing a particular point or edge of the network.In this paper; we study the index structures on network Voronoi diagrams that enable exactand fast response to contain query in road networks. We show that existing index structures;treating a network Voronoi cell as a simple polygon; may yield inaccurate results due to thenetwork topology; and fail to scale to large networks with numerous Voronoi generators …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2012,16
Discovering patterns in traffic sensor data,Farnoush Banaei-Kashani; Cyrus Shahabi; Bei Pan,Abstract We maintain a one of a kind; large-scale and high resolution (both spatially andtemporally) traffic sensor dataset collected from the entire Los Angeles County road network.Traffic sensors (installed under the road pavement) are used to measure real-time trafficflows through road segments. In this paper; we exploit this dataset to rigorously verify twopopular instinctive understandings about traffic flows on road segments: 1) each roadsegment has a typical traffic flow (known by local travelers) and one can often categorizeroad segments based on the similarity of their traffic flows; and 2) the road segments withineach category not only have similar traffic flows but also are similar in their othercharacteristics (such as locality; connectivity). Toward this end; we developed a hypothesisanalysis framework based on a variety of clustering and correlation evaluation techniques …,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on GeoStreaming,2011,16
Efficient viewpoint assignment for urban texture documentation,Houtan Shirani-Mehr; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract We envision participatory texture documentation (PTD) as a process in which agroup of users (dedicated individuals and/or general public) with camera-equipped mobilephones participate in collaborative collection of urban texture information. PTD enablesinexpensive; scalable and high resolution urban texture documentation. We have proposedto implement PTD in two steps [10]. At the first step; termed viewpoint selection; a minimumnumber of points in the urban environment are selected from which the texture of the entireurban environment (the part visible to cameras) can be collected/captured. At the secondstep; called viewpoint assignment; the selected viewpoints are assigned to the participatingusers such that given a limited number of users with various constraints (eg; restrictedavailable time) users can collectively capture the maximum amount of texture information …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2009,16
Feature subset selection on multivariate time series with extremely large spatial features,Hyunjin Yoon; Cyrus Shahabi,Several spatio-temporal data collected in many applications; such as fMRI data in medicalapplications; can be represented as a multivariate time series (MTS) matrix with m rows(capturing the spatial features) and n columns (capturing the temporal observations). Anydata mining task such as clustering or classification on MTS datasets are usually hinderedby the large size (ie; dimensions) of these MTS items. In order to reduce the dimensionswithout losing the useful discriminative features of the dataset; feature selection techniquesare usually preferred by domain experts since the relation of the selected subset of featuresto the originally acquired features is maintained. In this paper; we propose a new featureselection technique for MTS datasets where their spatial features (ie; number of rows) aremuch larger than their temporal observations (ie; number of columns); or m Gt n.

Weconsider those sources maintaining moving objects with predefined paths and schedules;and investigate different plans to perform queries on the integration of these data sourcesefficiently. Examples of such data sources are networks of railroad paths and schedules fortrains running between cities connected through these networks. A typical query on suchdata sources is to find all trains that pass through a given point on the network within a giventime interval. We show that traditional filter+ semi-join plans would not result in efficientquery response times on distributed spatio-temporal sources. Hence; we propose a novelspatio-temporal filter; called deviation filter; that exploits both the spatial and temporal …,Proceedings of the 9th ACM international symposium on Advances in geographic information systems,2001,16
Continuous display of video objects using multi-zone disks,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Seon Ho Kim; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Video servers are expected to play an important role in a number of applicationdomains; eg; library information systems; entertainment industry; scienti c applications; etc. Achallenging task when implementing these systems is to ensure a continuous display ofaudio and video objects. If special precautions are not taken; the display of an object may suer from frequent disruptions and delays; termed hiccups. A second challenging task is to congure a system to meet the performance requirements of an application: its desired number ofsimultaneous displays and the waiting tolerance of a display. For applications with largedata sets; eg; video servers; magnetic disks have established themselves as mass storagedevice of choice. A technique to increase the storage capacity of disks is zoning. A side-e ectof zoning is that it introduces a disk drive with variable transfer rates. This paper describes …,Second International Baltic Workshop on DB and IS,1995,16
Latent space model for road networks to predict time-varying traffic,Dingxiong Deng; Cyrus Shahabi; Ugur Demiryurek; Linhong Zhu; Rose Yu; Yan Liu,Abstract Real-time traffic prediction from high-fidelity spatiotemporal traffic sensor datasets isan important problem for intelligent transportation systems and sustainability. However; it ischallenging due to the complex topological dependencies and high dynamism associatedwith changing road conditions. In this paper; we propose a Latent Space Model for RoadNetworks (LSM-RN) to address these challenges holistically. In particular; given a series ofroad network snapshots; we learn the attributes of vertices in latent spaces which captureboth topological and temporal properties. As these latent attributes are time-dependent; theycan estimate how traffic patterns form and evolve. In addition; we present an incrementalonline algorithm which sequentially and adaptively learns the latent attributes from thetemporal graph changes.

Blind evaluation of location based queries using space transformation to preserve location privacy,Ali Khoshgozaran; Houtan Shirani-Mehr; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract In this paper we propose a fundamental approach to perform the class of Rangeand Nearest Neighbor (NN) queries; the core class of spatial queries used in location-basedservices; without revealing any location information about the query in order to preserveusers' private location information. The idea behind our approach is to utilize the power ofone-way transformations to map the space of all objects and queries to another space andresolve spatial queries blindly in the transformed space.

A multi-threshold online smoothing technique for variable rate multimedia streams,Roger Zimmermann; Cyrus Shahabi; Kun Fu; Mehrdad Jahangiri,Abstract Variable bit rate (VBR) compression for media streams allocates more bits tocomplex scenes and fewer bits to simple scenes. This results in a higher and more uniformvisual and aural quality. The disadvantage of the VBR technique is that it results in burstynetwork traffic and uneven resource utilization when streaming media. In this study wepropose an online media transmission smoothing technique that requires no a prioriknowledge of the actual bit rate. It utilizes multi-level buffer thresholds at the client side thattrigger feedback information sent to the server. This technique can be applied to both livecaptured streams and stored streams without requiring any server side pre-processing. Wehave implemented this scheme in our continuous media server and verified its operationacross real world LAN and WAN connections.

We term these networks Querical Data Networks (QDNs). Peer-to-peernetworks are examples of QDN. In this paper; first we identify and characterize QDN as anew family of data networks with common characteristics and applications. Subsequently; asthe first step toward realizing the evolved vision of QDN as a large-scale distributed queryprocessing system; we propose an efficiently searchable QDN model based on a recentlydeveloped small-world model.

Analysis of clustering techniques to detect hand signs,J Eisenstein; S Ghandeharizadeh; L Huang; C Shahabi; G Shanbhag; R Zimmermann,The term multimedia has a different meaning to different communities. The computerindustry uses this term to refer to a system that can display audio and video clips. Generallyspeaking; a multimedia system supports multiple presentation modes to convey information.Humans have five senses: sight; hearing; touch; smell and taste. In theory; a system basedon this generalized definition must be able to convey information in support of all senses.This would be a step towards virtual environments that facilitate total recall of an experience.This study builds on our previous work with audio and video servers and explores hapticdata in support of touch and motor skills. It investigates the use of clustering techniques torecognize hand signs using haptic data.

SKIF-P: a point-based indexing and ranking of web documents for spatial-keyword search,Ali Khodaei; Cyrus Shahabi; Chen Li,Abstract There is a significant commercial and research interest in location-based websearch engines. Given a number of search keywords and one or more locations(geographical points) that a user is interested in; a location-based web search retrieves andranks the most textually and spatially relevant web pages. In this type of search; both thespatial and textual information should be indexed. Currently; no efficient index structureexists that can handle both the spatial and textual aspects of data simultaneously andaccurately.

Spatiotemporal summarization of traffic data streams,Bei Pan; Ugur Demiryurek; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract With resource-efficient summarization and accurate reconstruction of the historictraffic sensor data; one can effectively manage and optimize transportation systems (eg;road networks) to become smarter (better mobility; less congestion; less travel time; and lesstravel cost) and greener (less waste of fuel and less greenhouse gas production). Theexisting data summarization (and archival) techniques are generic and are not designed toleverage the unique characteristics of the traffic data for effective data reduction. In thispaper; we propose and explore a family of data summaries that take advantage of the hightemporal and spatial redundancy/correlation among sensor readings from individualsensors and sensor groups; respectively; for effective data reduction.

However; there are scenarios in which thespatial attributes of the objects are intentionally transformed to a different; and usuallyunknown;(alien) system. Moreover; it is possible that the datasets were generated from alegacy system or are represented in a native coordinate system.

Optimizing information agents by selectively materializing data,Naveen Ashish; Craig A Knoblock; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract We present an approach for optimizing the performance of information agents bymaterializing useful information. A critical problem with information agents; particularly thosegathering and integrating information from Web sources is a high query response time. Thisis because the data needed to answer user queries is present across several different Websources (and in several pages within a source) and retrieving; extracting and integrating thedata is time consuming. We address this problem by materializing useful classes ofinformation and defining them as auxiliary data sources for the information agent. The keychallenge here is to identify the content and schema of the classes of information that wouldbe useful to materialize. We present an algorithm that identifies such classes by analyzingpatterns in user queries. We describe an implementation of our approach and …,AAAI/IAAI,1998,14

Privacy-preserving inference of social relationships from location data: a vision paper,Cyrus Shahabi; Liyue Fan; Luciano Nocera; Li Xiong; Ming Li,Abstract Social relationships between people; eg; whether they are friends with each other;can be inferred by observing their behaviors in the real world. Thanks to the popularity ofGPS-enabled mobile devices or online services; a large amount of high-resolution locationdata becomes available for such inference studies. However; due to the sensitivity oflocation data and user privacy concerns; those studies cannot be largely carried out onindividually contributed data without privacy guarantees. Furthermore; we observe that theactual location may not be needed for social relationship studies; but rather the fact that twopeople met and some statistical properties about their meeting locations; which can becomputed in a private manner. In this paper; we envision an extensible framework; dubbedPrivacy-preserving Location Analytics and Computation Environment (PLACE); which …,Proceedings of the 23rd SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2015,13
Scalable spatial crowdsourcing: A study of distributed algorithms,Abdullah Alfarrarjeh; Tobias Emrich; Cyrus Shahabi,Recently spatial crowd sourcing was introduced as a natural extension to traditional crowdsourcing allowing for tasks to have a geospatial component; ie; A task can only beperformed if a worker is physically present at the location of the task. The problem ofassigning spatial tasks to workers in a spatial crowd sourcing system can be formulated as aweighted bipartite b-matching graph problem that can be solved optimally by existingmethods for the minimum cost maximum flow problem. However; these methods are still toocomplex to run repeatedly for an online system; especially when the number of incomingworkers and tasks increases. Hence; we propose a class of approaches that utilizes anonline partitioning method to reduce the problem space across a set of cloud servers toconstruct independent bipartite graphs and solve the assignment problem in parallel.

Entropy-based histograms for selectivity estimation,Hien To; Kuorong Chiang; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Histograms have been extensively used for selectivity estimation by academics andhave successfully been adopted by database industry. However; the estimation error isusually large for skewed distributions and biased attributes; which are typical in real-worlddata. Therefore; we propose effective models to quantitatively measure bias and selectivitybased on information entropy. These models together with the principles of maximumentropy are then used to develop a class of entropy-based histograms. Moreover; sinceentropy can be computed incrementally; we present the incremental variations of ouralgorithms that reduce the complexities of the histogram construction from quadratic tolinear.

Continuous and unobtrusive capture of user-player behavior and experience to assess and inform game design and development,Tim Marsh; Shamus P Smith; Kiyoung Yang; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract We describe a continuous and unobtrusive approach to capture data amassed fromuser-player interactions with virtual or game environments. Central to this is a tool calledISIS (Immersidata analySIS) to query and identify data of interest and to index events withinvideo recordings of game sessions. Analysis of the associated data and video clips help usto understand user-players' behaviour and experience to assess and inform the design anddevelopment of games. ISIS supports six queries to identify: actions and activities; breaks ininteraction caused by reflection or ineffective and problematic design; navigation problemscaused by user disorientation; and events or tasks that are the most difficult to perform in agame. In the development of an educational serious game; we illustrate how our approachcan help inform redesign.

Utilizing bio-mechanical characteristics for user-independent gesture recognition,Farid Parvini; Cyrus Shahabi,We propose a novel approach for recognizing hand gestures by analyzing the data streamsgenerated by the sensors attached to the human hands. We utilize the concept of 'range ofmotion'in the movement and exploit this characteristic to analyze the acquired data. Weshow that since the relative 'range of motion'of each section of the hand involved in anygesture is a unique characteristic of that gesture; it provides a unique signature for thatgesture across different users. Based on this observation; we propose our approach forhand gesture recognition which addresses two major challenges: user-dependency anddevicedependency. Furthermore; we show that our approach neither requires calibration norinvolves training. We apply our approach for recognizing ASL signs and show that we canrecognize static ASL signs with no training. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate …,Data Engineering Workshops; 2005. 21st International Conference on,2005,12
Automatically and accurately conflating satellite imagery and maps,Ching-Chien Chen; Craig A Knoblock; Cyrus Shahabi; Snehal Thakkar,There is a wide variety of geo-spatial data available on the Internet; including a number ofdata sources that provide satellite imagery and maps of various regions.

Resiliency and robustness of alternative shape-based image retrieval techniques,Maytham Safar; Cyrus Shahabi; Chung-Hao Tan,The shape of an object is an important feature for image and multimedia similarity retrieval.However; as a consequence of uncertainty; shape representation techniques maysometimes work well only in certain environments; and their performance may dependcrucially on the quality of the technique used to represent the shapes. In this study; we focuson shape-based object retrieval under various uncertainty scenarios and conduct acomparison study on four techniques. We measure the effectiveness of the similarity retrievalof the four different shape representation methods (in terms of recall and precision) underthe following situations:(1) in the presence of noise in the database;(2) when the exactcorner points are unknown; and (3) factoring in the human perception of similarity.

Task selection in spatial crowdsourcing from worker’s perspective,Dingxiong Deng; Cyrus Shahabi; Ugur Demiryurek; Linhong Zhu,Abstract With the progress of mobile devices and wireless broadband; a new eMarketplatform; termed spatial crowdsourcing is emerging; which enables workers (aka crowd) toperform a set of spatial tasks (ie; tasks related to a geographical location and time) posted bya requester. In this paper; we study a version of the spatial crowdsourcing problem in whichthe workers autonomously select their tasks; called the worker selected tasks (WST) mode.Towards this end; given a worker; and a set of tasks each of which is associated with alocation and an expiration time; we aim to find a schedule for the worker that maximizes thenumber of performed tasks. We first prove that this problem is NP-hard. Subsequently; forsmall number of tasks; we propose two exact algorithms based on dynamic programmingand branch-and-bound strategies.

Web data retrieval: solving spatial range queries using k-nearest neighbor searches,Wan D Bae; Shayma Alkobaisi; Seon Ho Kim; Sada Narayanappa; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract As Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technologies have evolved; more andmore GIS applications and geospatial data are available on the web. Spatial objects in agiven query range can be retrieved using spatial range query− one of the most widely usedquery types in GIS and spatial databases. However; it can be challenging to retrieve thesedata from various web applications where access to the data is only possible throughrestrictive web interfaces that support certain types of queries. A typical scenario is theexistence of numerous business web sites that provide their branch locations through alimited “nearest location” web interface. For example; a chain restaurant's web site such asMcDonalds can be queried to find some of the closest locations of its branches to the user'shome address. However; even though the site has the location data of all restaurants in …,Geoinformatica,2009,11
Learning approximate thematic maps from labeled geospatial data,Mehdi Sharifzadeh; Cyrus Shahabi; Craig A Knoblock,ABSTRACT: Building accurate thematic maps which show distribution of a feature over ageographic area is a challenging task when the sample dataset is limited in size anddistribution. We propose the classification of these geospatial datasets as a promisingapproach towards building approximate thematic maps. However; choosing an appropriateclassification method that considers spatial autocorrelation in data is not trivial. This paperinvestigates the application of different classification methods on real-world spatial datasets.We study how factors such as distribution of the training data; neighborhood relationshipsand geometry of the original map can affect the accuracy of the generated map.Consequently; we report on measurements comparing the accuracy of the investigatedmethods on different datasets.

Fast approximate evaluation of olap queries for integrated statistical data,Jose Luis Ambite; Cyrus Shahabi; Rolfe R Schmidt; Andrew Philpot,Abstract We have developed a mediator architecture that integrates statistical informationabout energy products from several government agencies; such as the Bureau of LaborStatistics; the Energy Information Administration; and the California Energy Commission. Ourarchitecture has a dual mode of operation. First; our system can retrieve live data fromdatabases and web sources from these agencies. This allows the users to obtain completelyup-to-date data. However; for complex analytical queries that typically require large amountsof data and processing; live access does not offer the level of interactivity that some usersrequire. Second; our system can warehouse the information from the data sources to allowfor complex analytical queries to be executed much more efficiently. However; the datawould be only as recent as the last update to the data warehouse. In this paper we …,Proceedings of the First National Conference on Digital Government Research,2001,11
Traffic prediction using real-world transportation data,*,Real-time high-fidelity spatiotemporal data on transportation networks can be used to learnabout traffic behavior at different times and locations; potentially resulting in major savings intime and fuel. Real-world data collected from transportation networks can be used toincorporate the data's intrinsic behavior into a time-series mining technique to enhance itsaccuracy for traffic prediction. For example; the spatiotemporal behaviors of rush hours andevents can be used to perform a more accurate prediction of both short-term and long-termaverage speed on road-segments; even in the presence of infrequent events (eg; accidents).Taking historical rush-hour behavior into account can improve the accuracy of traditionalpredictors by up to 67% and 78% in short-term and long-term predictions; respectively.Moreover; the impact of an accident can be incorporated to improve the prediction …,*,2016,10
Real-time multi-criteria social graph partitioning: A game theoretic approach,Nikos Armenatzoglou; Huy Pham; Vasilis Ntranos; Dimitris Papadias; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Graph partitioning has attracted considerable attention due to its high practicality forreal-world applications. It is particularly relevant to social networks because it enables thegrouping of users into communities for market analysis and advertising purposes. In thispaper; we introduce RMGP; a type of real-time multi-criteria graph partitioning for socialnetworks that groups the users based on their connectivity and their similarity to a set ofinput classes. We consider RMGP as an on-line task; which may be frequently performed fordifferent query parameters (eg; classes). In order to overcome the serious performanceissues associated with the large social graphs found in practice; we develop solutions basedon a game theoretic framework. Specifically; we consider each user as a player; whose goalis to find the class that optimizes his objective function. We propose algorithms based on …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,10
An efficient index structure for large-scale geo-tagged video databases,Ying Lu; Cyrus Shahabi; Seon Ho Kim,Abstract An unprecedented number of user-generated videos (UGVs) are currently beingcollected by mobile devices; however; such unstructured data are very hard to index andsearch. Due to recent development; UGVs can be geo-tagged; eg; GPS locations andcompass directions; at the acquisition time at a very fine spatial granularity. Ideally; eachvideo frame can be tagged by the spatial extent of its coverage area; termed Field-Of-View(FOV). In this paper; we focus on the challenges of spatial indexing and querying of FOVs ina large repository. Since FOVs contain both location and orientation information; and theirdistribution is non-uniform; conventional spatial indexes (eg; R-tree; Grid) cannot index themefficiently. We propose a class of new R-tree-based index structures that effectively harnessFOVs' camera locations; orientations and view-distances; in tandem; for both filtering and …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2014,10
Temporal-textual retrieval: Time and keyword search in web documents,Ali Khodaei; Cyrus Shahabi; Amir Khodaei,Abstract As the web ages; many web documents become relevant only to certain timeperiods; such as web-pages containingnews and events or those documenting naturalphenomena. Hence; to retrieve the most relevant pages; in additionto providing the relevantkeywords; one may desire to identify the relevant time period (s) as well; eg;" BarackObama1980-1985". Unfortunately; not much work has been done by industry or academia tosupport this typeof searches. To the best of our knowledge; the only way that some searchengines exploit the time informationin the user query is to lter out those resulting web pageswhose publication/modication time are not withinthe queried time interval. In this paper; wepropose a new indexing and ranking framework for temporal-textualretrieval. The frameworkleverages the classical vector space model and provides a complete scheme for indexing …,International Journal of Next-Generation Computing,2012,10
Distributed spatial skyline query processing in wireless sensor networks,SunHee Yoon; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract. Spatial skyline queries can be used in wireless sensor networks for collaborativepositioning of multiple objects. However; designing a distributed spatial skyline algorithm inresource constrained wireless environments introduces several research challenges: how todistribute the computation of distances to multiple events in order to compute the skylinesefficiently; accurately; quickly; progressively; and concurrently while dealing with the networkand event dynamics. We address these challenges by designing; implementing; andextensively evaluating the Distributed Spatial Skyline (DSS) algorithm. DSS is the firstdistributed algorithm to compute spatial skylines. In a network of 554 nodes; DSS reducesthe communication overhead by up to 91% over a centralized algorithm.,Proceedings of the IPSN; San Francisco; CA; USA,2009,10
A hybrid aggregation and compression technique for road network databases,Ali Khoshgozaran; Ali Khodaei; Mehdi Sharifzadeh; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Vector data and in particular road networks are being queried; hosted andprocessed in many application domains such as in mobile computing. Many client systemssuch as PDAs would prefer to receive the query results in unrasterized format withoutintroducing an overhead on overall system performance and result size. While severalgeneral vector data compression schemes have been studied by different communities; wepropose a novel approach in vector data compression which is easily integrated within ageospatial query processing system. It uses line aggregation to reduce the number ofrelevant tuples and Huffman compression to achieve a multi-resolution compressedrepresentation of a road network database. Our experiments performed on an end-to-endprototype verify that our approach exhibits fast query processing on both client and server …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2008,10
Supporting range queries on web data using k-nearest neighbor search,Wan D Bae; Shayma Alkobaisi; Seon Ho Kim; Sada Narayanappa; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract A large volume of geospatial data is available on the web through various forms ofapplications. However; access to these data is limited by certain types of queries due torestrictive web interfaces. A typical scenario is the existence of numerous business web sitesthat provide the address of their branch locations through a limited “nearest location” webinterface. For example; a chain restaurant's web site such as McDonalds can be queried tofind some of the closest locations of its branches to the user's home address. However; eventhough the site has the location data of all restaurants in; for example; the state of California;the provided web interface makes it very difficult to retrieve this data set. We conceptualizethis problem as a more general problem of running spatial range queries by utilizing only k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) queries. Subsequently; we propose two algorithms to cover the …,International Symposium on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems,2007,10
Optimal traversal planning in road networks with navigational constraints,Leyla Kazemi; Cyrus Shahabi; Mehdi Sharifzadeh; Luc Vincent,Abstract A frequent query in geospatial planning and decision making domains (eg;emergency response; data acquisition; street cleaning); is to find an optimal traversal plan(OTP) that traverses an entire area (eg; a city) by navigating through all its streets. Theoptimality is defined in terms of the time it takes to complete the traversal. This time dependson the number of times each street segment is traversed as well as the navigation time suchas the time spent on changing direction at each intersection. While the problem roots in theclassic problems of graph theory; real-world geospatial constraints of road network introducenew application-specific challenges. In this paper; we propose two algorithms to find OTP ofa directed road network. Our greedy algorithm employs a classic graph traversal algorithm.During the traversal; it utilizes a set of heuristics at each intersection to minimize the total …,Proceedings of the 15th annual ACM international symposium on Advances in geographic information systems,2007,10
Additively weighted Voronoi diagrams for optimal sequenced route queries,Mehdi Sharifzadeh; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract The Optimal Sequenced Route (OSR) query strives to find a route of minimumlength starting from a given source location and passing through a number of typedlocations in a specific sequence imposed on the types of the locations. In this paper; wepropose a precomputation approach to OSR query in vector spaces. We exploit thegeometric properties of the solution space and theoretically prove its relation to AdditivelyWeighted Voronoi diagrams. Our approach recursively accesses these diagrams toincrementally build the optimal sequenced route. Our experimental results verify that our pre-computation approach outperforms the previous index-based approaches in terms of queryresponse time.,of the Third Workshop on Spatio-Temporal Database Management STDBM 06,2006,10
An energy conserving clustered aggregation technique leveraging spatial correlation,S Yoon; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract—In Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN); monitoring applications use in-networkaggregation to minimize energy overhead by reducing the number of transmissions betweenthe nodes. We observe that nearby sensor nodes monitoring an environmental feature (eg;temperature or brightness) typically register similar values. In this paper; we proposeClustered AG-gregation (CAG) which is a mechanism that reduces the number oftransmissions and provides approximate results to aggregate queries by utilizing the spatialcorrelation of sensor data. The result is guaranteed to be within user-provided error-tolerance threshold. While a query is disseminated to the network; CAG forms clusters ofnodes sensing similar values at the query time. Subsequently; only one value per cluster istransmitted up the aggregation tree at the response phase. Our simulation with synthetic …,IEEE SECON poster,2004,10
Deep learning: A generic approach for extreme condition traffic forecasting,Rose Yu; Yaguang Li; Cyrus Shahabi; Ugur Demiryurek; Yan Liu,Abstract Traffic forecasting is a vital part of intelligent transportation systems. It becomesparticularly challenging due to short-term (eg; accidents; constructions) and long-term (eg;peak-hour; seasonal; weather) traffic patterns. While most of the previously proposedtechniques focus on normal condition forecasting; a single framework for extreme conditiontraffic forecasting does not exist. To address this need; we propose to take a deep learningapproach. We build a deep neural network based on long short term memory (LSTM) units.We apply Deep LSTM to forecast peak-hour traffic and manage to identify uniquecharacteristics of the traffic data. We further improve the model for post-accident forecastingwith Mixture Deep LSTM model. It jointly models the normal condition traffic and the patternof accidents. We evaluate our model on a real-world large-scale traffic dataset in Los …,*,2017,9
ToSS-it: a cloud-based throwaway spatial index structure for dynamic location data,Afsin Akdogan; Cyrus Shahabi; Ugur Demiryurek,The widespread use of GPS-enabled devices have led to a number of emergingapplications that require monitoring and querying a large number of moving objects; such asin location-based services; mobile phone social networking; UAV surveillance; and carnavigation systems. In such applications; indexes for moving objects must support queriesefficiently and also cope with frequent updates. In this paper; we propose a cloud-basedthrowaway index structure; dubbed ToSS-it; where we generate the index from scratch in ashort period of time rather than updating it with every location change of the moving objects.ToSS-it employs inter-node and intra-node multi-core parallelism paradigm to rapidlyconstruct a distributed Voronoi Diagram.

Key frame selection algorithms for automatic generation of panoramic images from crowdsourced geo-tagged videos,Seon Ho Kim; Ying Lu; Junyuan Shi; Abdullah Alfarrarjeh; Cyrus Shahabi; Guanfeng Wang; Roger Zimmermann,Abstract Currently; an increasing number of user-generated videos (UGVs) are beingcollected–a trend that is driven by the ubiquitous availability of smartphones. Additionally; ithas become easy to continuously acquire and fuse various sensor data (eg; geospatialmetadata) together with video to create sensor-rich mobile videos. As a result; largerepositories of media contents can be automatically geo-tagged at the fine granularity offrames during video recording. Thus; UGVs have great potential to be utilized in variousgeographic information system (GIS) applications; for example; as source media toautomatically generate panoramic images. However; large amounts of crowdsourced mediadata are currently underutilized because it is very challenging to manage; browse andexplore UGVs.

Efficient K-nearest neighbor search in time-dependent spatial networks,*,The class of k Nearest Neighbor (k NN) queries in spatial networks has been studied in theliterature. Existing approaches for k NN search in spatial networks assume that the weight ofeach edge in the spatial network is constant. However; real-world edge-weights are time-dependent and vary significantly in short durations; hence invalidating the existing solutions.The problem of k NN search in time-dependent spatial networks; where the weight of eachedge is a function of time; is addressed herein. Two indexing schemes (Tight Network Indexand Loose Network Index) are proposed to minimize the number of candidate nearestneighbor objects and reduce the invocation of the expensive fastest-path computation intime-dependent spatial networks.

Efficient viewpoint selection for urban texture documentation,Houtan Shirani-Mehr; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract We envision participatory texture documentation (PTD) as a process in which agroup of participants (dedicated individuals and/or general public) with camera-equippedmobile phones participate in collaborative/social collection of the urban texture information.PTD enables inexpensive; scalable and high resolution urban texture documentation. PTDis implemented in two steps. In the first step; minimum number of points in the urbanenvironment are selected from which collection of maximum urban texture is possible. Thisstep is called viewpoint selection. In the next step; the selected viewpoints are assigned tousers (based on their preferences and constraints) for texture collection. This step is termedviewpoint assignment. In this paper; we focus on the viewpoint selection problem.

Towards this end; we have designed and developed a datastorage and retrieval system; called ProDA; which deploys wavelet transform and providesfast approximate answers with progressively increasing accuracy in support of the OSAqueries. ProDA employs a standard web-service infrastructure to enable remote users tointeract with their data. These web-services enable wavelet transformation of largemultidimensional datasets as well as inserting; updating; and exact; approximate andprogressive querying of these datasets in the wavelet domain.

They may require the system to match these streams against storedstreams to retrieve relevant data (patterns). With communication; for example; a speakingimpaired individual might utilize a haptic glove that translates hand signs into written(spoken) words. The glove consists of sensors for different finger joints. These sensorsreport their location and values as a function of time; producing streams of data.

A wavelet-based approach to improve the efficiency of multi-level surprise mining,Cyrus Shahabi; Seokkyung Chung; Maytham Safar,Abstract. Due to the large amount of the collected scientific data; it is becoming increasinglydifficult for scientists to comprehend and interpret the available data. Moreover; typicalqueries on these data sets are in the nature of identifying or visualizing trends and surprisesat a selected sub-region in multiple levels of abstraction rather than identifying informationabout a specific data point. In this paper; we show how a wavelet-based data structure; 2DTSA-tree stands for Trend and Surprise Abstractions Tree can be utilized efficiently to detectsurprises on spatio-temporal data at different levels. Furthermore; we show how to findsurprises within a specified period of time at different levels of abstraction eg; weekly; ormonthly by constructing 1D TSA-tree. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposedmethods; we evaluated our 2D TSA-tree using real and synthetic data.

An overview of techniques to support continuous retrieval of multimedia objects,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Cyrus Shahabi; Luis Ramos,Abstract Multimedia information systems have emerged as an essential component of manyapplication domains ranging from library information systems to entertainment technology.However; most implementations of these systems (based on a workstation) cannot support acontinuous display of multimedia objects and suffer from frequent disruptions and delaystermed hiccups. This is due to the low I/O bandwidth of the current disk technology; the highbandwidth requirement of multimedia objects; and the large size of these objects whichrequires them to be almost always disk resident. One approach to resolve this limitation is todecluster a multimedia object across multiple disk drives in order to employ the aggregatebandwidth of several disks to support its continuous retrieval (and display).

Forecasting spatiotemporal impact of traffic incidents for next-generation navigation systems,Bei Pan; Ugur Demiryurek; Chetan Gupta; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract The advances in sensor technologies enable real-time collection of high-fidelityspatiotemporal data on transportation networks of major cities. In this paper; using two real-world transportation datasets:(1) incident and (2) traffic data; we address the problem ofpredicting and quantifying the impact of traffic incidents. Traffic incidents include anynonrecurring events on road networks; such as accidents; weather hazard or roadconstruction. By analyzing archived incident data; we classify incidents based on theirfeatures (eg; time; location; type of incident). Subsequently; we model the impact of eachincident class on its surrounding traffic by analyzing the archived traffic data at the time andlocation of the incidents. Consequently; in real-time; if we observe a similar incident (fromreal-time incident feeds); we predict and quantify its impact on the surrounding traffic …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2015,8

A significant problem is that many interesting anduseful maps are only available in raster format; and even worse many maps have beenpoorly scanned and they are often compressed with lossy compression algorithms.Furthermore; for many of these maps there is no meta data providing the geographiccoordinates; scale; or projection. Previous research on map processing has developedtechniques that typically work on maps from a single map source. In contrast; we havedeveloped a general approach to finding and processing street maps. This includestechniques for discovering maps online; extracting geographic and textual features frommaps; using the extracted features to determine the geographic coordinates of the maps …,Document Recognition and Retrieval XVII,2010,8
Yoda; an adaptive soft classification model: content-based similarity queries and beyond,Yi-Shin Chen; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract. Providing a customized result set based upon a user preference is the ultimateobjective of many content-based image retrieval systems. There are two main challenges inmeeting this objective: First; there is a gap between the physical characteristics of digitalimages and the semantic meaning of the images. Secondly; different people may havedifferent perceptions on the same set of images. To address both these challenges; wepropose a model; named Yoda; that conceptualizes content-based querying as the task ofsoft classifying images into classes. These classes can overlap; and their members aredifferent for different users. The “soft” classification is hence performed for each and everyimage feature; including both physical and semantic features. Subsequently; each imagewill be ranked based on the weighted aggregation of its classification memberships. The …,Multimedia systems,2003,8

Multiple index structures for efficient retrieval of 2D objects,Cyrus Shahabi; Maytham Safar; Hezhi Ai,Many applications require the storage and management of large databases of 2D objects.One of the important functionalities required by all of these applications is the capability tofind objects in a database that match a given object. We concentrate on whole matchingqueries; in which a query object is compared with a set of objects to find the ones that areeither exactly identical or similar to the query object. There are two obstacles for efficientexecution of whole-match queries. First; the general problem of comparing two 2D objectsunder rotation; scaling and translation invariance is known to be computationally expensive.Second; the size of the databases are growing; and hence a query should be answeredwithout accessing all the objects in the database. To address both obstacles; we identify aset of six features that could be extracted from the objects' minimum bounding circle (MBC …,Data Engineering; 1999.

Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network: Data-Driven Traffic Forecasting,Yaguang Li; Rose Yu; Cyrus Shahabi; Yan Liu,Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting has significant implications in sustainability;transportation and health-care domain. Traffic forecasting is one canonical example of suchlearning task. This task is challenging due to (1) non-linear temporal dynamics withchanging road conditions;(2) complex spatial dependencies on road networks topology and(3) inherent difficulty of long-term time series forecasting. To address these challenges; wepropose Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network to incorporate both spatial andtemporal dependency in traffic flow. We further integrate the encoder-decoder frameworkand scheduled sampling to improve long-term forecasting. When evaluated on real-worldroad network traffic data; our approach can accurately capture spatiotemporal correlationsand consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 12%-15%.

Price-aware real-time ride-sharing at scale: an auction-based approach,Mohammad Asghari; Dingxiong Deng; Cyrus Shahabi; Ugur Demiryurek; Yaguang Li,Abstract Real-time ride-sharing; which enables on-the-fly matching between riders anddrivers (even en-route); is an important problem due to its environmental and societalbenefits. With the emergence of many ride-sharing platforms (eg; Uber and Lyft); the designof a scalable framework to match riders and drivers based on their various constraints whilemaximizing the overall profit of the platform becomes a distinguishing business strategy. Akey challenge of such framework is to satisfy both types of the users in the system; eg;reducing both riders' and drivers' travel distances. However; the majority of the existingapproaches focus only on minimizing the total travel distance of drivers which is not alwaysequivalent to shorter trips for riders. Hence; we propose a fair pricing model thatsimultaneously satisfies both the riders' and drivers' constraints and desires (formulated …,Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2016,7
GeoSocialBound: an efficient framework for estimating social POI boundaries using spatio--textual information,Dung D Vu; Hien To; Won-Yong Shin; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract In this paper; we present a novel framework for estimating social point-of-interest(POI) boundaries; also termed GeoSocialBound; utilizing spatio--textual information basedon geo-tagged tweets. We first start by defining a social POI boundary as one small-scalecluster containing its POI center; geographically formed with a convex polygon. Motivated byan insightful observation with regard to estimation accuracy; we formulate a constrainedoptimization problem; in which we are interested in finding the radius of a circle such that anewly defined objective function is maximized. To solve this problem; we introduce anefficient optimal estimation algorithm whose runtime complexity is linear in the number ofgeo-tags in a dataset. In addition; we empirically evaluate the estimation performance of ourGeoSocialBound algorithm for various environments and validate the complexity analysis …,Proceedings of the Third International ACM SIGMOD Workshop on Managing and Mining Enriched Geo-Spatial Data,2016,7
SCAWG: A toolbox for generating synthetic workload for spatial crowdsourcing,Hien To; Mohammad Asghari; Dingxiong Deng; Cyrus Shahabi,With the popularity of mobile devices; Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) is emerging as a newframework that enables human workers to perform tasks in the physical world. With spatialcrowdsourcing; the goal is to outsource a set of spatiotemporal tasks (ie; tasks with time andlocation) to a set of workers; which requires the workers to be physically present at thelocation of the tasks in order to perform them. Research efforts have focused on differentaspects of SC; such as task assignment; task scheduling and protecting workers' privacy.However; one of the biggest challenges for the research community is the absence of publicreal-world datasets from SC applications such as Uber; TaskRabbit; etc. Therefore; wepropose a synthetic workload generator for the SC applications; namely SCAWG1; toproduce common datasets for experimentation; thus leading to reproducible research …,Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops (PerCom Workshops); 2016 IEEE International Conference on,2016,7
Probabilistic estimation of link travel times in dynamic road networks,Mohammad Asghari; Tobias Emrich; Ugur Demiryurek; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Due to the availability of large historical and real-time traffic data; car navigationsystems are becoming more and more advanced in predicting the travel time for variousroutes and finding the fastest route from a source to a destination given a start time. Themost advanced of these systems predict the travel time of the routes; given past trafficpatterns in order to find the best route. However; the best route is not necessarily a reliableroute as well; ie; the route with the least variation in possible travel times. The most reliableroute is desirable when traveling with a deadline; eg; to reach a flight at the airport or toarrive on time for an important meeting. To find the most reliable route; one needs to predictthe probability distribution of travel times for that route. This in turn requires the estimation oftravel time probability distributions for each and every link; given a link-entrance-time.

Active key frame selection for 3D model reconstruction from crowdsourced geo-tagged videos,Guanfeng Wang; Ying Lu; Luming Zhang; Abdullah Alfarrarjeh; Roger Zimmermann; Seon Ho Kim; Cyrus Shahabi,Automatic reconstruction of 3D models is attracting increasing attention in the multimediacommunity. Scene recovery from video sequences requires a selection of representativevideo frames. Most prior work adopted content-based techniques to automate key frameextraction. However; these methods take no frame geo-information into consideration andare still compute-intensive. Here we propose a new approach for key frame selection basedon the geographic properties of videos. Currently; an increasing number of user-generatedvideos (UGVs) are collected-a trend that is driven by the ubiquitous availability ofsmartphones. Additionally; it has become easy to continuously acquire and fuse varioussensor data (eg; geo-spatial metadata) with video to create geo-tagged mobile videos.

Wavelet disk placement for efficient querying of large multidimensional data sets,Cyrus Shahabi; R Schmidt,Abstract New data-intensive applications operate on diverse types of data; with newcharacteristics in querying the data. In particular: 1) the data set is large andmultidimensional popular examples are spatial and temporal data; as well as sensor datastreams; 2) the queries are complex; asking for trends or outliers in data; correlationbetween different dimensions; or aggregation of one or more (measure) attributes given abounded multidimensional space (termed; range-aggregate queries); and 3) theapplications are online and interactive requiring fast response time and hence the resultscan be approximate and/or progressively become exact. These characteristics lead us tobelieve that wavelet transform will become a likely tool for future database query processing.Although a straightforward adoption of wavelets is to utilize it to reduce the data size at …,Department of Computer Science Technical Reports,2004,7
Improving user profiles for e-commerce by genetic algorithms,Yi-Shin Chen; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Recommendation systems are widely adopted in e-commerce businesses forhelping customers locate products they would like to purchase. The major challenge forthese systems is bridging the gap between the physical characteristics of data with the users'perceptions. In order to address this challenge; employing user profiles to improve accuracybecomes essential. However; the system performance may degrade due to inaccuracy ofuser profiles. Therefore; an effective system should offer learning mechanisms to correcterroneous user inputs. In this paper; we extend an existing recommendation system; Yoda;to improve the profiles automatically by utilizing users' relevance feedback with geneticalgorithms (GA). Our experimental results indicate that the retrieval accuracy is significantlyincreased by using the GA-based learning mechanism.,*,2002,7
Data placement techniques for serpentine tapes,Ali E Dashti; Cyrus Shahabi,Due to the information explosion; a growing number of applications store; maintain; andretrieve large volumes of data; where the data is required to be available online or near-online. These data repositories are implemented using hierarchical storage structures(HSS). One of the components of HSS is tertiary storage; which provides cost-effectivestorage for the vast amount of data manipulated by these applications. However it is crucialthat the 3-4 orders of magnitude difference in access time between tertiary storage andsecondary storage be bridged to allow online or near-online access to the tertiary residentdata. This wide access-gap is mainly due to: the sequential nature of the most populartertiary technologies (ie; tapes) and the low number of drives per media in tertiary storagejukeboxes. In this paper we propose a novel data placement technique specifically …,System Sciences; 2000. Proceedings of the 33rd Annual Hawaii International Conference on,2000,7
Differentially private publication of location entropy,Hien To; Kien Nguyen; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Location entropy (LE) is a popular metric for measuring the popularity of variouslocations (eg; points-of-interest). Unlike other metrics computed from only the number of(unique) visits to a location; namely frequency; LE also captures the diversity of the users'visits; and is thus more accurate than other metrics. Current solutions for computing LErequire full access to the past visits of users to locations; which poses privacy threats. Thispaper discusses; for the first time; the problem of perturbing location entropy for a set oflocations according to differential privacy. The problem is challenging because removing asingle user from the dataset will impact multiple records of the database; ie; all the visitsmade by that user to various locations. Towards this end; we first derive non-trivial; tightbounds for both local and global sensitivity of LE; and show that to satisfy ε-differential …,Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2016,6
Differentially private h-tree,Hien To; Liyue Fan; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of publishing a synopsis of two-dimensionaldatasets using differential privacy. The challenge is to enable accurate answers range countqueries given a privacy budget. The state-of-the-art methods either construct a hierarchy ofthe partitions; or lay a one or two-level equi-width grid over the data domain; which are notsuitable for high dimension and skewed datasets; respectively. To overcome such issues;we propose a technique that takes advantage of a two-level tree and a data-dependentmethod; namely private h-tree. As the height of the tree is kept low; h-tree requires lessbudget for node counts and thus more budget can be used for median splits. As splittingpoints of h-tree must be selected privately; we propose a recursive budget strategy tominimize noise added to the queries by reducing the number of median splits from linear …,Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Privacy in Geographic Information Collection and Analysis,2015,6

Although most socialinteractions are recorded through online activities; we believe that social experiences takingplace offline in the real physical world are equally if not more important. This paperintroduces a geo-social model that derives social activities from the history of people'smovements in the real world; ie; who has been where and when. In particular; fromspatiotemporal histories; we infer real-world co-occurrences-being there at the same time-and then use co-occurrences to quantify social distances between any two persons.

BroadScale: Efficient scaling of heterogeneous storage systems,Shu-Yuen D Yao; Cyrus Shahabi; Roger Zimmermann,Abstract Scalable storage architectures enable digital libraries and archives for the additionor removal of storage devices to increase storage capacity and bandwidth or retire olderdevices. Past work in this area have mainly focused on statically scaling homogeneousstorage devices. However; heterogeneous devices are quickly being adopted for storagescaling since they are usually faster; larger; more widely available; and more cost-effective.We propose BroadScale; an algorithm based on Random Disk Labeling; to dynamicallyscale heterogeneous storage systems by distributing data objects according to their deviceweights. Assuming a random placement of objects across a group of heterogeneous storagedevices; our optimization objectives when scaling are to ensure a uniform distribution ofobjects; redistribute a minimum number of objects; and maintain fast data access with low …,International Journal on Digital Libraries,2006,6
Hybrid Query and Data Ordering for Fast and Progressive Range-Aggregate Query Answering,Cyrus Shahabi; Mehrdad Jahangiri; Dimitri Sacharidis,Abstract Data analysis systems require range-aggregate query answering of largemultidimensional datasets.

In addition; with error forecasting; we provide estimations on theaccuracy of the generated approximate results. Our framework utilizes the wavelettransformation of query and data hypercubes. While prior work focused on the ordering ofeither the query or the data coefficients; we propose a class of hybrid ordering techniquesthat exploits both query and data wavelets in answering queries progressively.

Continuous Media Retrieval Optimizer for Hierarchical Storage Structures.,Cyrus Shahabi; Ali E Dashti; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,ABSTRACT One of the key components of multimedia systems is a Continuous Media server(CM server) that guarantees the uninterrupted delivery of continuous media data (eg; video).Digital libraries and commercial broadcasting systems are sample applications that canbenet from such multimedia systems. Queries imposed by such applications might requirethe retrieval of one or more continuous objects stored on the CM server. Traditionally;multimedia systems have opted to guarantee that the CM server can display all the objectsin the set to the user with no interruptions and with very strict timing among the display ofthese objects; resulting in a single retrieval plan. However; for a class of applications; wehave observed that depending on the user query; user pro le; and session pro le; there are anumber of exibilities that can be exploited for retrieval optimization.

Spatial influence-measuring followship in the real world,Huy Pham; Cyrus Shahabi,Finding influential people in a society has been the focus of social studies for decades dueto its numerous applications; such as viral marketing or spreading ideas and practices. Acritical first step is to quantify the amount of influence an individual exerts on another; termedpairwise influence. Early social studies had to confine themselves to surveys and manualdata collections for this purpose; more recent studies have exploited web data (eg; blogs). Inthis paper; for the first time; we utilize people's movement in the real world (akaspatiotemporal data) to derive pairwise influence. We first define followship to capture thephenomenon of an individual visiting a real-world location (eg; restaurant) due the influenceof another individual who has visited that same location in the past. Subsequently; we cointhe term spatial influence as the concept of inferring pairwise influence from …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,5

Causality and responsibility: Probabilistic queries revisited in uncertain databases,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Abstract Recently; due to ubiquitous data uncertainty in many real-life applications; it hasbecome increasingly important to study efficient and effective processing of variousprobabilistic queries over uncertain data; which usually retrieve uncertain objects that satisfyquery predicates with high probabilities. However; one annoying; yet challenging; problemis that; some probabilistic queries are very sensitive to low-quality objects in uncertaindatabases; and the returned query answers might miss some important results (due to lowdata quality).

Scalable shortest paths browsing on land surface,Songhua Xing; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract The growing popularity of online Earth visualization tools and geo-realistic gamesand the availability of high resolution terrain data have motivated a new class of queries tothe interests of the GIS and spatial database community: spatial queries (eg; kNN) over landsurface. However; the fundamental challenges that restrict the applicability of these studiesto real world applications are the prohibitive time complexity and storage overhead toprecompute the shortest surface paths. In this paper; for the first time; we propose anapproximate solution to address both challenges and allow browsing the shortest surfacepaths in O (log N+√ N) time; where N is the size of the terrain. With this method; the timeand space requirements for an exhaustive all-pair pre-computation have been reduced fromO (N 3) to O (N 1.5) and O (N) respectively.

A partial selection query is an arbitraryselection query that is satisfied with a fraction\in of the results; a universal operation withapplications in database tuning; query optimization and approximate query processing inpeer-to-peer databases. DBSampler is based on an epidemic dissemination algorithm. Wemodel the epidemic dissemination as a percolation problem and by rigorous percolationanalysis tune DBSampler per-query and on-thefly to answer partial queries correctly andefficiently. We verify the efficiency of DBSampler in terms of query cost and query time viaextensive simulation.,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06. Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on,2006,5
Modelling peer-to-peer data networks under complex system theory,Cyrus Shahabi; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani,Abstract A Peer-to-peer Data Network (PDN) is an open and evolving society of peer nodesthat assemble into a network to pool and share their data (or more generally; their resourcesrepresented by data) for mutual benefit. By an interesting analogy to a democratic humansociety; when nodes join the PDN society; while they agree to follow a restricted set ofcommon rules in interaction with their peers (ie; the social rules governing the PDN society);they preserve their autonomy as individuals. For example; as part of their social obligationsall PDN nodes (or at least those who are good PDN citizens) create and maintainconnection with a set of neighbor nodes and participate in cooperative query processing(eg; forwarding search queries for data discovery). Aside from the social rules; the PDNleaves the behavior of the individual nodes unregulated and flexible; to be managed by …,International Workshop on Databases in Networked Information Systems,2005,5
Alternative strategies for performing spatial joins on web sources,Cyrus Shahabi; Mohammad R Kolahdouzan; Maytham Safar,Abstract. With the current information explosion on the Web; numerous applications requireaccess to a collection of different but related pieces of distributed geospatial data. In thispaper; we focus on one set of such applications that requires efficient support of spatialoperations (specifically; spatial join) on distributed non-database sources. The mainchallenge with this environment is that remote sources are usually read-only and/or do notsupport spatial queries. Moreover; several of these Web-based applications can tolerateeither some level of inaccuracy or progressively filtered (or polished) results. Therefore;conventional distributed spatial join strategies are not applicable or efficient in thisenvironment. To address these challenges; we first break down the process of distributedspatial join operation into three steps:(1) local to remote transfer;(2) remote spatial …,Knowledge and information systems,2004,5
The neuroanatomical rat brain viewer (NeuART),Ali Esmail Dashti; Gully APC Burns; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Shuping Jia; Cyrus Shahabi; Donna M Simmons; James Stone; Larry Swanson,The neuroanatomical rat brain viewer (NeuARt) is based on neuroanatomical extensions tothe neurocore database system that allow neuroscientists to browse; compare; and querycomplex; spatially distributed patterns of the label obtained from different experiments attheir desktops through a network connection. This chapter describes an ongoing informatics-based project to simplify and optimize the process of superimposing neuroanatomical dataonto the plates of a brain atlas with multimedia databasing and network technology. Thebasic functionality of the NeuARt viewer is to allow users to query a database of results fromneuroanatomical experiments; and to place the results of queries into an active set.

Efficient support of soft query in image retrieval systems,Cyrus Shahabi; Yi-Shin Chen,ABSTRACT We explore the use of soft computing and user defined classifications inmultimedia database systems for contentbased queries. With multimedia databases; due tosubjectivity of human perception; an object may belong to different classes with differentprobabilities (“soft” membership); as opposed to “hard” membership supported byconventional database systems. Therefore; we propose a unified model that captures bothhard and soft memberships. In practice; however; in the process of implementing our modelby extending a conventional database system; we increase the query processing complexitysignificantly. To remedy for this increase; we propose a variety of techniques to scale downthe complexity by orders of magnitude.,Proceedings of SSGRR 2000 Computer and eBusiness Conference; Rome; Italy; Aguest,2000,5
Visualization of spatial neuroanatomical data,Cyrus Shahabi; Ali Esmail Dashti; Gully Burns; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Ning Jiang; Larry W Swanson,5 Conclusion We have described a neuroanatomical visualization tool to navigate throughbrain structures while monitoring related data generated as a result of experiments or frompublished literature. This tool consists of many components including a platform-independent graphical user interface; an object-relational database system; a knowledgebase system to reason about published literature; and a number of spatial components toreason about the topological structures of the brain and its relevant data. Currently; we areworking on different techniques to represent; query; and manage three-dimensionalstructures of the brain (ie; brain volumes) through many levels of 2-dimensional structures.,International Conference on Advances in Visual Information Systems,1999,5

On scheduling atomic and composite multimedia objects,Cyrus Shahabi; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Surajit Chaudhuri,Abstract In multi-user multimedia information systems (eg; movie-on-demand; digital-editing); scheduling the retrievals of continuous media objects becomes a challenging task.This is because of both intra and inter object time dependencies. Intra-object timedependency refers to the real-time display requirement of a continuous media object. Inter-object time dependency is the temporal relationships de ned among multiple continuousmedia objects. In order to compose tailored multimedia presentations; a user might de necomplex time dependencies among multiple continuous media objects having variouslength and display bandwidth requirement.

Distance-based outlier detection in data streams,Luan Tran; Liyue Fan; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Continuous outlier detection in data streams has important applications in frauddetection; network security; and public health. The arrival and departure of data objects in astreaming manner impose new challenges for outlier detection algorithms; especially in timeand space efficiency. In the past decade; several studies have been performed to addressthe problem of distance-based outlier detection in data streams (DODDS); which adopts anunsupervised definition and does not have any distributional assumptions on data values.Our work is motivated by the lack of comparative evaluation among the state-of-the-artalgorithms using the same datasets on the same platform. We systematically evaluate themost recent algorithms for DODDS under various stream settings and outlier rates.

However; the scarcity of the AR content and the lack of user contexts aremajor impediments to providing and representing rich and dynamic multimedia content onAR applications. In this study; we propose an approach to search and filter big multimediadata; specifically geo-tagged mobile videos; for context-aware AR applications. Thechallenge is to automatically search for interesting video segments out of a huge amount ofuser-generated mobile videos; which is one of the biggest multimedia data; to be efficientlyincorporated into AR applications.

A comparative study of linear and region based diagrams,Björn Gottfried,Abstract There are two categories of objects spatial information science investigates: actualobjects and their spatial properties; such as in geography; and abstract objects which areemployed metaphorically; as for visual languages. A prominent example of the latter arediagrams that model knowledge of some domain. Different aspects of diagrams are ofinterest; including their formal properties or how human users work with them; for example;with diagrams representing sets. The literature about diagrammatic systems for therepresentation of sets shows a dominance of region-based diagrams like Euler circles andVenn diagrams. The effectiveness of these diagrams; however; is limited because region-based diagrams become quite complex for more then three sets. By contrast; lineardiagrams are not equally prevalent but enable the representation of a greater number of …,Journal of Spatial Information Science,2015,4

A Unified Framework to Incorporate Soft Query into Image Retrieval Systems.,Cyrus Shahabi; Yi-Shin Chen,Abstract: We explore the use of soft computing and user defined classifications in multimediadatabase systems for content-based queries. With multimedia databases; due to subjectivityof human perception; an object may belong to different classes with different probabilities(“soft” membership); as opposed to “hard” membership supported by conventional databasesystems. Therefore; we propose a unified model that captures both hard and softmemberships. In practice; however; our model significantly increases the computationcomplexity (both online and off-line) and the storage complexity of content-based queries.Previously; we introduced a novel fuzzy-logic based aggregation technique to address theonline computation complexity.

Inferring social strength from spatiotemporal data,Huy Pham; Cyrus Shahabi; Yan Liu,Abstract The advent of geolocation technologies has generated unprecedented richdatasets of people's location information at a very high fidelity. These location datasets canbe used to study human behavior; for example; social studies have shown that people whoare seen together frequently at the same place and same time are most probably sociallyrelated. In this article; we are interested in inferring these social connections by analyzingpeople's location information; this is useful in a variety of application domains; from salesand marketing to intelligence analysis. In particular; we propose an entropy-based model(EBM) that not only infers social connections but also estimates the strength of socialconnections by analyzing people's co-occurrences in space and time. We examine twoindependent methods: diversity and weighted frequency; through which co-occurrences …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2016,3

Cost-efficient partitioning of spatial data on cloud,Afsin Akdogan; Saratchandra Indrakanti; Ugur Demiryurek; Cyrus Shahabi,With the rise of mobile technologies (eg; smart phones; wearable technologies) and location-aware Internet browsers; a massive amount of spatial data is being collected since suchtools allow users to geo-tag user content (eg; photos; tweets). Meanwhile; cloud computingproviders such as Amazon and Microsoft allow users to lease computing resources whereusers are charged based on the amount of time they reserve each server; with noconsideration of utilization. One key factor that affects server utilization is partitioning methodespecially in data-driven location-based services. Because if the data partitions are notaccessed; the servers storing them remain idle but the user is still charged. Whereas;existing spatial data partitioning techniques aim to 1) cluster spatially close data objects tominimize disk I/O and 2) create equi-sized partitions.

The Pareto principle is everywhere: finding informative sentences for opinion summarization through leader detection,Linhong Zhu; Sheng Gao; Sinno Jialin Pan; Haizhou Li; Dingxiong Deng; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Most previous works on opinion summarization focus on summarizing sentimentpolarity distribution toward different aspects of an entity (eg; battery life and screen of amobile phone). However; users' demand may be more beyond this kind of opinionsummarization. Besides such coarse-grained summarization on aspects; one may prefer toread detailed but concise text of the opinion data for more information. In this paper; wepropose a new framework for opinion summarization. Our goal is to assist users to gethelpful opinion suggestions from reviews by only reading a short summary with a fewinformative sentences; where the quality of summary is evaluated in terms of both aspectcoverage and viewpoints preservation.

One key challenge in predicting trafficcongestion is how much to rely on the historical data vs The real-time data. To better utilizeboth the historical and real-time data; in this paper we propose a novel online frameworkthat could learn the current situation from the real-time data and predict the future using themost effective predictor in this situation from a set of predictors that are trained usinghistorical data. In particular; the proposed framework uses a set of base predictors (eg ASupport Vector Machine or a Bayes classifier) and learns in real-time the most effective oneto use in different contexts (eg Time; location; weather condition).

Using location based social networks for quality-aware participatory data transfer,Houtan Shirani-Mehr; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract The sensing systems that monitor physical environments rely on communicationinfrastructures (wired or wireless) to collect data from the sensors embedded in theenvironment. However; in many urban environments pre-existing communicationinfrastructures are not available; and installing and using new infrastructures is unjustifiablyexpensive and/or technically infeasible. For such environments; we envision ParticipatoryData Transfer (PDT) as an alternative communication medium that leverages LBSN(Location Based Social Networks) for data collection.

Plot query processing with wavelets,Mehrdad Jahangiri; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Plots are among the most important and widely used tools for scientific dataanalysis and visualization. With a plot (aka range group-by query) data are divided into anumber of groups; and at each group; they are summarized over one or more attributes for agiven arbitrary range. Wavelets; on the other hand; allow efficient computation of (individual)exact and approximate aggregations. With the current practice; to generate a plot over awavelet-transformed dataset; one aggregate query is executed per each plot point; hence;for large plots (containing numerous points) a large number of aggregate queries aresubmitted to the database. On the contrary; we redefine a plot as a range group-by queryand propose a wavelet-based technique that exploits I/O sharing across plot points toevaluate the plot efficiently and progressively.

The location of animal refuges might notbe precisely known; and the path of rivers might be uncertain due to water volumefluctuations and changing land characteristics. The extension of lakes can also change andthus have uncertain areas. All these are examples of vague spatial objects. The animalrefuge locations can be modeled as a vague point object where the precisely knownlocations are called the kernel point object and the assumed locations are denoted as theconjecture point object.

EntityBases: Compiling; Organizing and Querying Massive Entity Repositories.,Craig A Knoblock; José Luis Ambite; Kavita Ganesan; Maria Muslea; Steven Minton; Greg Barish; Evan Gamble; Claude Nanjo; Kane See; Cyrus Shahabi; Ching-Chien Chen,Abstract–The current approaches for linking information across sources; often called recordlinkage; require finding common attributes between the sources and comparing the recordsusing those attributes. This often leads to unsatisfactory results because the sources areoften missing information or contain incorrect or outdated information. We are addressingthis problem by developing the technology to build massive entity knowledgebases; whichwe call EntityBases. The key idea is to create a comprehensive knowledgebase for theentities of interest (eg; companies). In order to build such a knowledge base; we mustaddress the issues of linking entities with multi-valued attributes obtained fromheterogeneous sources and providing a virtual repository that can be efficiently queried.This paper describes how we have addressed these issues and shows how an …,IC-AI,2007,3

GeoMatchMaker: automatic and efficient matching of vector data with spatial attributes in unknown geometry systems,MR Kolahdouzan; C Ching-Chien; S Shahabi; Craig A Knoblock,Abstract Large amount of geospatial data are now available from public and privateorganizations in vector data formats. Users of these geospatial data usually require the datathat are gathered from different sources to be integrated and fused for knowledge discovery.A vital step for fusion of the geospatial datasets is to identify the matched features among thedatasets. There have been several efforts to automatically or semi-automatically detectmatched features across different vector datasets. These solutions usually require thefeatures to be in the same coordinate system so their spatial attributes can be compared.This renders these solutions impractical for the scenarios where the coordinate systems ofthe datasets are unknown.

Two-Phase Decision Fusion Based On User Preference,Yi-Shin Chen; Cyrus Shahabi; G Burns,Abstract In order to prevent information overload on the Web; people sometimes rely oncritics' evaluations to narrow down their search for favorite objects. However; due to thesubjectivity of humans' perception; the set of favorite objects varies from one person to theother. This is because each object can be reviewed using different criteria; and differentpeople have different reliance on the same set of criteria and/or critics. Therefore; the task offusing the decisions of different critics considering the users' preferences is challenging. Toaddress this challenge; we introduce a new concept; termed two-phase decision fusion;where both critics and criteria evaluations are considered in order to personalize a search.In each phase; we utilize various decision fusion operators and investigate their interplay.We conducted several empirical experiments within the context of two real-world …,Brain Res,2004,3
Rapid integration of online and geospatial data sources for knowledge discovery,Craig Knoblock; Cyrus Shahabi; John Wilson,Much of the work on information integration has focused on the dynamic integration ofstructured data sources; such as databases or XML data.

However; flooding is not a scalable communication mechanism; mainlybecause of the communication overhead it imposes to the network. We use the percolationtheory to formalize the main problem with flooding in the context of power-law networks;propose a remedial approach with our probabilistic flooding technique; and find the optimaloperating point for probabilistic flooding rigorously; such that it improves scalability of thenormal flooding by 99%.,Proceedings of the twenty-second annual symposium on Principles of distributed computing,2003,3
A multi-threshold online smoothing technique for variable rate multimedia streams,Roger Zimmermann; Kun Fu; Mehrdad Jahangiri; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Variable bit rate (VBR) compression for media streams allocates more bits tocomplex scenes and fewer bits to simple scenes. This results in a higher and more uniformvisual and aural quality. The disadvantage of the VBR technique is that it results in burstynetwork traffic and uneven resource utilization when streaming media. In this study wepropose an online media transmission smoothing technique that requires no a prioriknowledge of the actual bit rate. It utilizes multi-level buffer thresholds at the client side thattrigger feedback information sent to the server. This technique can be applied to both livecaptured streams and stored streams without requiring any server side pre-processing. Wehave implemented this scheme in our continuous media server and verified its operationacross real world LAN and WAN connections. The results show smoother transmission …,KLUWER MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS JOURNAL,2003,3
Disk Labeling Techniques: Hash-Based Approaches to Disk Scaling,Shu-Yuen Didi Yao; Cyrus Shahabi; Per-Åke Larson,Abstract Scalable storage architectures allow for the addition or removal of disks to increasestorage capacity and bandwidth or retire older disks. Assuming random placement of datablocks across multiple disks of a disk array; our optimization objective is to redistribute aminimum number of blocks after disk scaling. In addition; a uniform distribution; and hence abalanced load; should be ensured after redistribution. Moreover; the redistributed blocksshould be retrieved efficiently during the normal mode of operation: in one disk access andwith low complexity computation. To achieve this; we propose an algorithm called RandomDisk Labeling (RDL); based on double hashing; where disks can be added or removedwithout any increase in complexity. We compare RDL with other proposed techniques anddemonstrate its effectiveness through experimentation.,*,2003,3

We propose a new type of algorithm that produces exact range sum queryresults as eciently as the best known methods; but also produces accurate estimates of thequery result long before the exact computation is complete. This combination allows us todeliver progressive query evaluation: we provide a quick approximate query response thatbecomes increasingly accurate as the computation progresses.,*,2001,3
Cost analysis of serpentine tape data placement techniques in support of continuous media display,Ali Esmail Dashti; Cyrus Shahabi; Roger Zimmermann,Abstract. Due to the information explosion we are witnessing; a growing number ofapplications store; maintain; and retrieve large volumes of continuous media (CM) data;where the data is required to be available online or near-online. These data repositories areimplemented using hierarchical storage structures (HSS). One of the components of HSS istertiary storage; which provides a cost-eective storage for the vast amount of datamanipulated by these applications. However; it is crucial that the 3-4 orders of magnitudedierence in access time between the tertiary storage and the secondary storage be bridgedto allow online or near-online access to the tertiary resident data. This wide accessgap ismainly due to: the sequential nature of the most popular tertiary technologies (ie; tapes) andthe low number of drives per media in tertiary storage juke boxes.

Run-Time Optimizations of Join Queries for Distributed Databases over the Internet,Cyrus Shahabi; Latifur Khan; Dennis McLeod; Vishal Shah,Abstract A new probe-based run-time optimization technique is developed anddemonstrated in the context of an Internet-based distributed database environment. Moreand more common are database systems which are distributed across serverscommunicating via the Internet where a query at a given site might require data from remotesites. Optimizing the response time of such queries is a challenging task due to theunpredictability of server performance and network traffic at the time of data shipment thismay result in the selection of an expensive query plan using a static query optimizer. Weconstructed an experimental setup consisting of two servers running the same DBMSconnected via the Internet. Concentrating on join queries; we demonstrate how a staticquery optimizer might choose an expensive plan by mistake.

Design of a scalable multimedia storage manager,Steven Berson; Ali Dashti; S Ghandeharizadeh,Abstract During the past decade; the information technology has evolved to store andretrieve continuous media data types; eg; audio and video objects. Unlike the traditionaldata types (eg; text); this new data type requires its objects to be retrieved at a pre-speci edbandwidth. If its objects are retrieved at a rate lower than its pre-speci ed bandwidth then adisplay will su er from frequent disruptions and delays termed hiccups. Storage managersthat support a hiccup-free retrieval of continuous media data types are commonly referred toas multimedia storage managers. They are expected to play a major role in manyapplications including library information systems; entertainment technology; educationalapplications; etc. For the past three years; we have been investigating the design of amultimedia storage manager.

Prediction-based task assignment in spatial crowdsourcing,Peng Cheng; Xiang Lian; Lei Chen; Cyrus Shahabi,With the rapid advancement of mobile devices and crowdsourcing platforms; spatialcrowdsourcing has attracted much attention from various research communities. A spatialcrowdsourcing system periodically matches a number of locationbased workers with nearbyspatial tasks (eg; taking photos or videos at some specific locations). Previous studies onspatial crowdsourcing focus on task assignment strategies that maximize an assignmentscore based solely on the available information about workers/tasks at the time ofassignment. These strategies can only achieve local optimality by neglecting theworkers/tasks that may join the system in a future time. In contrast; in this paper; we aim toimprove the global assignment; by considering both present and future (via predictions)workers/tasks. In particular; we formalize a new optimization problem; namely maximum …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,2

Scenic routes now: Efficiently solving the time-dependent arc orienteering problem,Gregor Jossé; Ying Lu; Tobias Emrich; Matthias Renz; Cyrus Shahabi; Ugur Demiryurek; Matthias Schubert,Abstract: This paper extends the Arc Orienteering Problem (AOP) to large road networks withtime-dependent travel times and time-dependent value gain; termed Twofold Time-Dependent AOP or 2TD-AOP for short. In its original definition; the NP-hard OrienteeringProblem (OP) asks to find a path from a source to a destination maximizing the accumulatedvalue while not exceeding a cost budget. Variations of the OP and AOP have many practicalapplications such as mobile crowdsourcing tasks (eg; repairing and maintenance ordispatching field workers); diverse logistics problems (eg; crowd control or controllingwildfires) as well as several tourist guidance problems (eg; generating trip recommendationsor navigating through theme parks). In the proposed 2TD-AOP; travel times and valuefunctions are assumed to be time-dependent. The dynamic values model; for instance …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.08484,2016,2

The turn-by-turn directionsprovided in the existing navigation applications are exclusively derived from underlying roadnetwork topology information ie; the connectivity of nodes to each other. Therefore; the turn-by-turn directions are simplified as metric translation of physical world (eg distance/time toturn) to spoken language. Such translation-that ignores human cognition about thegeographic space-is often verbose and redundant for the drivers who have knowledgeabout the geographical areas.

Efficient K-nearest neighbor search in time-dependent spatial networks,*,The class of k Nearest Neighbor (k NN) queries in spatial networks has been studied in theliterature. Existing approaches for k NN search in spatial networks assume that the weight ofeach edge in the spatial network is constant. However; real-world edge-weights are time-dependent and vary significantly in short durations; hence invalidating the existing solutions.The problem of k NN search in time-dependent spatial networks; where the weight of eachedge is a function of time; is addressed herein. Two indexing schemes (Tight Network Indexand Loose Network Index) are proposed to minimize the number of candidate nearestneighbor objects and reduce the invocation of the expensive fastest-path computation intime-dependent spatial networks.

A case study of participatory data transfer for urban temperature monitoring,Houtan Shirani-Mehr; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani; Cyrus Shahabi; Lin Zhang,Abstract The sensing systems that monitor physical environments rely on communicationinfrastructures (wired or wireless) to collect data from the sensors embedded in theenvironment. However; in many urban environments pre-existing communicationinfrastructures are not available; and installing new infrastructures is unjustifiably expensiveand/or technically infeasible. For such environments; we envision Participatory DataTransfer (PDT) as an alternative communication medium that leverages users participationfor data transfer. With PDT; users use mobile devices to receive data from sensors; andforward the sensed data through the ad hoc network of the mobile devices until the data isreceived by the data aggregators (ie; data sinks). Sensor deployment and ad hocrouting/networking are two related problems that are both extensively studied in the …,International Symposium on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems,2011,2

A peer-to-peer database is a database that itsrelations are horizontally fragmented and distributed among the nodes of a peer-to-peernetwork. The partial read operation is a data retrieval operation required for approximatequery processing in peer-to-peer databases. A partial read operation answers to β-queries:given β∈[0; 1] and a relation R; a fraction β of the tuples in R must be retrieved from thedatabase to answer a β-query. Despite the simplicity of the β-query; due to the distributed;evolving and autonomous nature of the peer-to-peer databases correct and efficientimplementation of the partial read operation is challenging.

To address these shortcomings; we have been working on ageneric and scalable geospatial decision making system dubbed GeoDec. In this paper; wefirst discuss many of the new features of GeoDec; particularly its spatial querying utilities.Next; we argue that in some applications; a user of GeoDec may not want to reveal thelocation of the query and/or its result set to the GeoDec server to preserve his/her privacy.Hence; for GeoDec to remain applicable in these scenarios; it should be able to evaluate thespatial queries without knowing the locations of the query and/or results.

Inthis paper; first we define a query model that formalizes and generalizes the typical P2Pexact-match search queries to partial selection queries; ie; selection queries that can besatisfied by a partial result-set (rather than the entire result-set). As compared to exact-matchqueries; partial selection queries are not only more general; but also more cost-efficient andpractical. Even though the existing search mechanisms can be applied to answer suchqueries; none of them are designed to answer these queries intelligently and efficiently …,Submitted for review,2004,2

Multidimensional index structures,Maytham H Safar; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract As mentioned in Chapters 1 and 3; the shape representation of objects can be usedto query and search the object databases for different purposes. For example; CAD/CAM;computer graphics; and multimedia applications try to find objects in a database that match agiven object. Besides similarity matching; many other applications in the areas ofcartography; computer vision; spatial reasoning; cognitive science; image and multimediadatabases; and geographic applications require to represent and process spatial relationsbetween objects. There are two obstacles for efficient execution of such queries. First; thegeneral problem of comparing two 2D objects under rotation; scaling; and translationinvariance is known to be computationally expensive [3]. Second; the size of the databasesare growing and hence given a query object the matching objects should be retrieved …,*,2003,2
Image similarity measures,Maytham H Safar; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract The purpose of an image retrieval system is to organize and index images so that ifwe have a large number of images in the database; given a query image; the relevantimages can be retrieved efficiently upon request. Relevant images is a list of images fromthe database which are most “similar” in some aspects to the query image. So the mainissues of an image retrieval system are the proper indexing of images (see Chapter 7) andsimilarity comparison during the query process. In this chapter we consider the shape aspectof objects. Given a unique shape signature (based on boundary) for each object; thequestion is how to measure the distance and similarity between boundaries. For solving thisproblem; we need two things. First; a feature which represents the shape information of theimage (see Chapter 3). Second; a similarity measure to compute the similarity between …,*,2003,2

A real-time framework for task assignment in hyperlocal spatial crowdsourcing,Luan Tran; Hien To; Liyue Fan; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) is a novel platform that engages individuals in the actof collecting various types of spatial data. This method of data collection can significantlyreduce cost and turnover time and is particularly useful in urban environmental sensing;where traditional means fail to provide fine-grained field data. In this study; we introducehyperlocal spatial crowdsourcing; where all workers who are located within thespatiotemporal vicinity of a task are eligible to perform the task (eg; reporting theprecipitation level at their area and time). In this setting; there is often a budget constraint;either for every time period or for the entire campaign; on the number of workers to activateto perform tasks. The challenge is thus to maximize the number of assigned tasks under thebudget constraint despite the dynamic arrivals of workers and tasks.

Recently; there have been increasing efforts to visualize healthcare MTS databased on star charts or parallel coordinates. However; such techniques might not be idealfor visualizing a large MTS dataset; since it is difficult to obtain insights or interpretations dueto the inherent high dimensionality of MTS.

Hybrid Indexes to Expedite Spatial-Visual Search,Abdullah Alfarrarjeh; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract: Due to the growth of geo-tagged images; recent web and mobile applicationsprovide search capabilities for images that are similar to a given query image andsimultaneously within a given geographical area. In this paper; we focus on designing indexstructures to expedite these spatial-visual searches. We start by baseline indexes that arestraightforward extensions of the current popular spatial (R*-tree) and visual (LSH) indexstructures. Subsequently; we propose hybrid index structures that evaluate both spatial andvisual features in tandem. The unique challenge of this type of query is that there areinaccuracies in both spatial and visual features. Therefore; different traversals of the indexstructures may produce different images as output; some of which more relevant to the querythan the others. We compare our hybrid structures with a set of baseline indexes in both …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.05200,2017,1

An entropy-based framework for efficient post-disaster assessment based on crowdsourced data,Sasan Tavakkol; Hien To; Seon Ho Kim; Patrick Lynett; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract After a disaster; authorities need to efficiently collect and analyze data from thedisaster area in order to increase their situational awareness and make informed decisions.The conventional data acquisition methods such as dispatching inspection teams are oftentime-consuming. With the widespread availability of mobile devices; crowdsourcing hasbecome an effective alternative means for data acquisition. However; the large amount ofcrowdsourced data is often overwhelming and requires triage on the collected data. In thispaper; we introduce a framework to crowdsource post-disaster data and a new prioritizationstrategy based on the expected value of the information contained in the collected data(entropy) and their significance. We propose a multi-objective problem to analyze a portionof the collected data such that the entropy retrieved from the disaster area and the …,Proceedings of the Second ACM SIGSPATIALInternational Workshop on the Use of GIS in Emergency Management,2016,1
Validation of automated mobility assessment using a single 3d sensor,Jiun-Yu Kao; Minh Nguyen; Luciano Nocera; Cyrus Shahabi; Antonio Ortega; Carolee Winstein; Ibrahim Sorkhoh; Yu-chen Chung; Yi-an Chen; Helen Bacon,Abstract Reliable mobility assessment is essential to diagnose or optimize treatment inpersons affected by mobility disorders; eg; for musculo-skeletal disorders. In this work; wepresent a system that is able to automatically assess mobility using a single 3D sensor. Wevalidate the system ability to assess mobility and predict the medication state of Parkinson'sdisease patients while using a relatively small number of motion tasks. One key componentof our system is a graph-based feature extraction technique that can capture the dynamiccoordination between parts of the body while providing results that are easier to interpretthan those obtained with other data-driven approaches. We further discuss the system andthe study design; highlighting aspects that provide insights for developing mobilityassessment applications in other contexts.,European Conference on Computer Vision,2016,1
Geographic Segmentation via Latent Poisson Factor Model,Rose Yu; Andrew Gelfand; Suju Rajan; Cyrus Shahabi; Yan Liu,Abstract Discovering latent structures in spatial data is of critical importance tounderstanding the user behavior of location-based services. In this paper; we study theproblem of geographic segmentation of spatial data; which involves dividing a collection ofobservations into distinct geo-spatial regions and uncovering abstract correlation structuresin the data. We introduce a novel; Latent Poisson Factor (LPF) model to describe spatialcount data. The model describes the spatial counts as a Poisson distribution with a meanthat factors over a joint item-location latent space. The latent factors are constrained withweak labels to help uncover interesting spatial dependencies. We study the LPF model on amobile app usage data set and a news article readership data set. We empiricallydemonstrate its effectiveness on a variety of prediction tasks on these two data sets.,Proceedings of the Ninth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2016,1
Prediction-based task assignment in spatial crowdsourcing (technical report),Peng Cheng; Xiang Lian; Lei Chen; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract: Spatial crowdsourcing refers to a system that periodically assigns a number oflocation-based workers with spatial tasks nearby (eg; taking photos or videos at somespatial locations). Previous works on the spatial crowdsourcing usually designed taskassignment strategies that maximize some assignment scores; which are however onlybased on available workers/tasks in the system at the time point of assigning workers/tasks.These strategies may achieve local optimality; due to the neglect of future workers/tasks thatmay join the system. In contrast; in this paper; we aim to achieve" globally" optimal taskassignments; by considering not only those present; but also future (via predictions);workers/tasks. Specifically; we formalize an important problem; namely prediction-basedspatial crowdsourcing (PB-SC); which expects to obtain a" globally" optimal strategy for …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.08518,2015,1
Seismic response analysis of a coupled vehicle-bridge system,Qing Zeng; Elias G Dimitrakopoulos; Themelina S Paraskeva,Abstract. Traditionally; the traffic and the seismic dynamics have been consideredindependently when analyzing the seismic response of bridges. Given the ever increasingtraffic volume though; vehicles are more likely to encounter an earthquake while crossing abridge. Hence; there is a growing need to examine the dynamic vehicle-bridge interaction(VBI) under the simultaneous action of seismic ground motions. This study presents anoriginal framework to analyze the seismic response of a coupled vehicle-bridge systemduring earthquake excitation. The examined dynamical system consists of the vehiclesubsystem and the bridge subsystem. The two subsystems are coupled through the contactforces between the vehicle wheels and the bridge. The bridge subsystem is simulated withthe finite element method; while the truck vehicles are modelled as rigid body assemblies …,COMPDYN 2015; 5th ECCOMAS Thematic Conference on Computational Methods in Structural Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering,2015,1

Real-time video segmentation based on motion detection,Sharannya Sudarshan; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani; Cyrus Shahabi,Many techniques and algorithms have been proposed for moving object segmentation andthese are generally divided into two categories. The first category of techniques usuallysegment moving objects on every key frame and use them as initialization values; and thentrack these in the following frames [1; 2; 3]. The main drawback in this category is that it isdifficult to automatically achieve the initial segmentation due to the lack of temporalinformation. Another category of techniques utilize motion information between twosuccessive frames; and then segment each frame of video sequence the same way [4; 5].The main drawback is that the performance may be unstable when objects either move toofast or pause between two successive frames.,Integrated Media System Center Retreat (IMSC) Google Scholar,2013,1

Efficient approximate visibility query in large dynamic environments,Leyla Kazemi; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani; Cyrus Shahabi; Ramesh Jain,Abstract Visibility query is fundamental to many analysis and decision-making tasks in virtualenvironments. Visibility computation is time complex and the complexity escalates in largeand dynamic environments; where the visibility set (ie; the set of visible objects) of anyviewpoint is probe to change at any time. However; exact visibility query is rarely necessary.Besides; it is inefficient; if not infeasible; to obtain the exact result in a dynamic environment.In this paper; we formally define an Approximate Visibility Query (AVQ) as follows: given aviewpoint v; a distance ε and a probability p; the answer to an AVQ for the viewpoint v is anapproximate visibility set such that its difference with the exact visibility set is guaranteed tobe less than ε with confidence p. We propose an approach to correctly and efficiently answerAVQ in large and dynamic environments.

A distributed algorithm to compute spatial skyline in wireless sensor networks,SunHee Yoon; Cyrus Shahabi,Spatial skyline queries can be used in wireless sensor networks for collaborative positioningof multiple objects. However; designing a distributed spatial skyline algorithm in resourceconstrained wireless environments introduces several research challenges: how to combinemulti-dimensional data;(eg distances to multiple events) to compute the skylines efficiently;accurately; quickly; progressively; and concurrently while dealing with the network and eventdynamics. We address this challenge by designing Distributed Spatial Skyline (DSS)algorithm. DSS is the first distributed algorithm to compute spatial skylines.

Multi-layer gesture recognition: An experimental evaluation,Jacob Eisenstein; Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Leana Golubchik; Cyrus Shahabi; Donghui Yan; Roger Zimmermann,Abstract Gesture recognition techniques often suffer from being highly device-dependentand hard to extend. If a system is trained using data from a specific glove input device; thatsystem is typically unusable with any other input device. The set of gestures that a system istrained to recognize is typically not extensible; without retraining the entire system. Wepropose a novel gesture recognition framework to address these problems. This frameworkis based on a multi-layered view of gesture recognition. Only the lowest layer is devicedependent; it converts raw sensor values produced by the glove to a glove-independentsemantic description of the hand. The higher layers of our framework can be reused acrossgloves; and are easily extensible to include new gestures. We have experimentallyevaluated our framework and found that it yields at least as good performance as …,Technical Report,2002,1
Perspective: Geographical Information Systems,Cyrus Shahabi; Shuping Jia,The geographical information system (GIS) is the digital information system whose recordsare somehow geographically referenced. This chapter discusses some of the distinctionsbetween the brain and geographical atlases; and describes the approaches to tacklevarious challenges resulting from these differences. Georeferenced data consist of dataelements whose locations are spatially referenced to earth. The data types managed by GISare conventional record-based data consisting of alphanumeric attributes; images; andspatial data. For spatial data; spatial relationships are categorized into three types:topological relationships; direction relationships; and metric relationships. Raster data aresimply a bitmap that; if displayed; illustrate the image of an area. They are tightly related tofield view or space view.

Improving the Performance of Audio-Based Similarity Queries with Clustering,Cyrus Shahabi; Mohammad Alshayeji; Ning Jiang; Latifur Khan,Abstract Many multimedia applications require the storage and retrieval of non-traditionaldata types such as audio; video and images. One important functionality required by theseapplications is the capability to nd objects in a database that are similar to a given object.The comparison algorithms for multimedia data types are typically computationallyexpensive. Therefore; the performance of similarity queries can be improved signi cantly byreducing the number of invocations of these comparison algorithms. In this paper; wepropose the utilization of clustering techniques in order to reduce the number of invocationsof comparison algorithms. Although clustering improves the performance of similarityqueries; it might introduce inaccuracy in the results. We propose a family of similarity queryexecution techniques to strike a compromise between accuracy and performance.

Geographic Information Systems,HARRISBURG AREA,In Australia; the establishment of irrigated and non-irrigated dryland agriculture isaccompanied by extensive salinization of productive agricultural land and degradation ofrivers. The cause of dryland soil salinization is the clearance of native vegetation andreplacement with shallow-rooted crops over the last 200 years. It has only become clearlyevident over the last 100 years due to the lag in hydrological response. Nearly one millionhectares of arable land are currently affected and the trend is towards increased salinization.In the state of South Australia dryland soil salinization is one of the most widespread andsignificant forms of land degradation existing. It is currently estimated that it now affects225;000 ha of previously arable lands (State Dryland Salinity Committee; 1990: 1)(Fig. 1); a400% increase on the 1982 estimate of 55;000 ha (Working Party on Dryland Salting in …,Global Environment Change: Remote Sensing and GIS Perspectives,1995,1
Management of Virtual Replicas in Parallel Multimedia Information Systems,Shahram Ghandeharizadeh; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Multimedia information systems have emerged as an essential component of manyapplication domains ranging from library information systems to entertainment technology.However; most implementations of these systems (based on a workstation) cannot support acontinuous display of multimedia objects and su er from frequent disruptions and delaystermed hiccups. This is due to the low I/O bandwidth of the current disk technology; the highbandwidth requirement of multimedia objects; and the large size of these objects whichrequires them to be almost always disk resident.

Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network: Data-Driven Traffic Forecasting,Yaguang Li; Rose Yu; Cyrus Shahabi; Yan Liu,Abstract Spatiotemporal forecasting has various applications in neuroscience; climate andtransportation domain. Traffic forecasting is one canonical example of such learning task.The task is challenging due to (1) complex spatial dependency on the road network;(2) non-linear temporal dynamics with changing road conditions and (3) inherent difficulty of long-term forecasting. To address these challenges; we propose to model the traffic flow as adiffusion process on a directed graph and introduce Diffusion Convolutional RecurrentNeural Network (DCRNN); a deep learning framework for traffic forecasting that incorporatesboth spatial and temporal dependency in the traffic flow. Specifically; DCRNN captures thespatial dependency using bidirectional random walks on the graph; and the temporaldependency using the encoder-decoder architecture with scheduled sampling. We …,*,*,1

We start by baseline indexes that arestraightforward extensions of the current popular spatial (R*-tree) and visual (LSH) indexstructures. Subsequently; we propose hybrid index structures that evaluate both spatial andvisual features in tandem. A unique challenge of spatial-visual search is that there areinaccuracies in both spatial and visual features.

Location Privacy in Spatial Crowdsourcing,Hien To; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract: Spatial crowdsourcing (SC) is a new platform that engages individuals in collectingand analyzing environmental; social and other spatiotemporal information. With SC;requesters outsource their spatiotemporal tasks to a set of workers; who will perform thetasks by physically traveling to the tasks' locations. This chapter identifies privacy threatstoward both workers and requesters during the two main phases of spatial crowdsourcing;tasking and reporting. Tasking is the process of identifying which tasks should be assignedto which workers. This process is handled by a spatial crowdsourcing server (SC-server).The latter phase is reporting; in which workers travel to the tasks' locations; complete thetasks and upload their reports to the SC-server. The challenge is to enable effective andefficient tasking as well as reporting in SC without disclosing the actual locations of …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.06860,2017,*
On Identifying Disaster-Related Tweets: Matching-based or Learning-based?,Hien To; Sumeet Agrawal; Seon Ho Kim; Cyrus Shahabi,Social media such as tweets are emerging as platforms contributing to situationalawareness during disasters. Information shared on Twitter by both affected population (eg;requesting assistance; warning) and those outside the impact zone (eg; providingassistance) would help first responders; decision makers; and the public to understand thesituation first-hand. Effective use of such information requires timely selection and analysisof tweets that are relevant to a particular disaster. Even though abundant tweets arepromising as a data source; it is challenging to automatically identify relevant messagessince tweet are short and unstructured; resulting to unsatisfactory classification performanceof conventional learning-based approaches. Thus; we propose a simple yet effectivealgorithm to identify relevant messages based on matching keywords and hashtags; and …,Multimedia Big Data (BigMM); 2017 IEEE Third International Conference on,2017,*
PaRE: A System for Personalized Route Guidance,Yaguang Li; Han Su; Ugur Demiryurek; Bolong Zheng; Tieke He; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract The turn-by-turn directions provided in existing navigation applications areexclusively derived from underlying road network topology information; ie; the connectivity ofedges to each other. Therefore; the turn-by-turn directions are simplified as metric translationof physical world (eg distance/time to turn) to spoken language. Such translation-thatignores human cognition of the geographic space-is often verbose and redundant for thedrivers who have knowledge about the geographical areas. In this paper; we study aPersonalized RoutE Guidance System dubbed PaRE-with which the goal is to generatemore customized and intuitive directions based on user generated content. PaRE utilizes awealth of user generated historical trajectory data to extract namely" landmarks"(eg; point ofinterests or intersections) and frequently visited routes between them from the road …,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web,2017,*
Label Propagation on K-partite Graphs with Heterophily,Dingxiong Deng; Fan Bai; Yiqi Tang; Shuigeng Zhou; Cyrus Shahabi; Linhong Zhu,Abstract: In this paper; for the first time; we study label propagation in heterogeneous graphsunder heterophily assumption. Homophily label propagation (ie; two connected nodes sharesimilar labels) in homogeneous graph (with same types of vertices and relations) has beenextensively studied before. Unfortunately; real-life networks are heterogeneous; they containdifferent types of vertices (eg; users; images; texts) and relations (eg; friendships; co-tagging) and allow for each node to propagate both the same and opposite copy of labels toits neighbors. We propose a $\mathcal {K} $-partite label propagation model to handle themystifying combination of heterogeneous nodes/relations and heterophily propagation. Withthis model; we develop a novel label inference algorithm framework with update rules innear-linear time complexity. Since real networks change over time; we devise an …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1701.06075,2017,*
An On-line Truthful and Individually Rational Pricing Mechanism for Ride-sharing,Mohammad Asghari; Cyrus Shahabi,Traffic congestions; high costs of car ownership and greenhouse emissions are just a fewproblems that have made road transportation one of the main challenges of our era. Ride-sharing is an alternative transportation model which helps mitigate the negative effects ofroad transportation. According to [1]; in only one month; Uber-Pool reduced individual ridesin San Francisco for about 674;000 miles which accounts for more than 13;000 gallons ofgasoline and about 120 metric tons of CO2 emissions. In addition to well-known ride-sharingplatforms (eg; Lyft; Uber; DiDi); other applications like Instacart and AmazonFresh; whichuse the same model as ridesharing platforms; can also benefit from a real-time ride-sharingframework. Due to its economical; environmental and social benefits; many researchershave studied ride-sharing platforms [5; 8–11; 15; 19]. Many former studies [8; 9; 15] focus …,*,2017,*

Spatial Crowdsourcing,Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Spatial crowdsourcing engages individuals; groups; and communities in the act ofcollecting; analyzing; and disseminating urban; social; and other spatiotemporal information.This new paradigm of data collection has been shown to be useful when traditional meansfail (eg; due to disaster); are censored; or do not scale in time and space. The wideapplicability of spatial crowdsourcing primarily became possible due to the broad availabilityof mobile devices. With spatial crowdsourcing; the goal is to efficiently outsource a set ofspatiotemporal tasks (ie; tasks related to time and location) to a set of workers; whichrequires the workers to perform the tasks by physically traveling to those locations. Hence;spatial crowdsourcing strategies must be designed to take advantage of large populations ofhuman workers for ad hoc spatiotemporal tasks–they must consider the environment's …,The International Encyclopedia of Geography,2017,*

Inferring Traffic Incident Start Time with Loop Sensor Data,Mingxuan Yue; Liyue Fan; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Traffic incidents and their impacts have been largely studied to improve road safetyand to reduce incurred life and economic losses. However; the inaccuracy of incident datacollected from transportation agencies; especially the start time; poses a great challenge totraffic incident research. We present INFIT; a system that infers the incident start time utilizingtraffic data collected by loop sensors. The core of INFIT is IIG; our newly developed inferencealgorithm. The key idea is that IIG considers the traffic speed at multiple upstream locations;to mitigate the randomness in traffic data and to distinguish among multiple impact factors.INFIT includes an interactive interface with real-world incident datasets. We demonstrateINFIT with three exploratory use cases and show the usefulness of our inference algorithms.,Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2016,*

To manage such update-heavy workloads; several throwawayindex structures have recently been proposed; where a static index is rebuilt periodicallyfrom scratch rather than updated incrementally. It has been shown that throwaway indicesoutperform specialized moving-object indices that maintain location updates incrementally.However; throwaway indices suffer from scalability due to their single-server design and theonly distributed throwaway index (D-MOVIES); extension of a centralized approach; doesnot scale out as the number of servers increases; especially during query processing …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,*

One of the most popular classes of such services is k-nearest neighbor (kNN)queries where users search for geographical points of interests (eg; restaurants) and thecorresponding directions and travel times to these locations in road networks. The onlinenature of these services requires almost instant response time. Accordingly; manyalgorithms have been developed to speed up kNN search in road networks by using avariety of precomputation techniques.

Towards Private Navigation of Tree Structured Spatial Indexes,Ali Khoshgozaran; Cyrus Shahabi,With many location-based services; spatial data such as points of interest are indexed at apotentially untrusted host and queries are evaluated by navigating the underlying indexstructure used to partition the data. While encryption can prevent the host from learning thedata content (ie; what is accessed); it cannot hide the frequency that index nodes areaccessed while navigating the index for query processing. Combining the knowledge ofsuch access frequencies with public knowledge readily available about points of interest; thehost can infer sensitive information about the indexed data and hence the locations of theusers querying it (violating location privacy). In this paper; we propose a technique thathides frequency access to the nodes of tree-structured spatial indexes (eg; R-tree) from anuntrusted server hosting the data.

Temporal Modeling of Spatiotemporal Networks,Ugur Demiryurek; Bei Pan; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani; Cyrus Shahabi,ABSTRACT A spatiotemporal network is a spatial network (eg; road network) along with thecorresponding time-dependent travel-time for each segment of the network. Design andanalysis of policies and plans on spatiotemporal networks (eg; for path planning withlocationbased services) require realistic models that accurately represent the temporalbehavior of such networks. In this paper; for the first time we propose a temporal modelingframework for spatiotemporal networks that enables 1) generating an accurate temporalmodel from real temporal data collected from any spatiotemporal network (so as to be ableto publish the temporal model of the spatiotemporal network without having to release thereal data); and 2) augmenting any given spatial network model with a correspondingrealistic temporal model custom-built for the specific spatial network (in order to be able to …,*,2009,*
SPE SPE-121395-PP,A Khodaei; Hyokyeong Lee; F Banaei-Kashani; C Shahabi; I Ershaghi,Abstract In this paper we introduce a new analytical approach for management ofwaterfloods in heterogeneous reservoirs. The main contribution is the development of aprocess and metric to evaluate the pair-wise injector-producer (IP) relationships; ie; toquantify the impact of any injection well on the neighboring producing wells. The proposedmetric is particularly designed to consider the non-linearity of the IP relationship between theinjection and production rates by using the Mutual Information (MI) data mining tool. Non-linearity of the IP relationship is the main challenge in quantifying this relationship and; tothe best of our knowledge; this is the first time that MI is used in the petroleum literature for IPrelationship identification. In addition to MI that captures the non-linear correlation in the IPrelationship; our metric considers other parameters such as the distance between the IP …,*,2009,*
Applications of Sensor Network Data Management,Farnoush Banaei-Kashani; Cyrus Shahabi,1. Software non-determinism: A software system is non-deterministic if; when re-executed; itresults in a different execution path than a prior execution. Non-determinism can arise when;for example; paths are determined by relative processor speed or the sequence of externalevents. Such software bugs have been called ''Heisenbugs''(hard failures being ''Bohrbugs'').2. Soft hardware failures: Hardware can also suffer from ''Heisenbugs.''For example; atransient hardware failure may be triggered by an environmental cause; such as a cosmicray changing a memory bit; etc. 3. Operator failures: Systems occasionally require operatorintervention. Operators; being human; make mistakes. An operator is unlikely to make thesame mistake at the same point in a subsequent execution.,*,2009,*

Automatic alignment of vector data and orthoimagery for the national map,Craig A Knoblock; Cyrus Shahabi; Ching-Chien Chen; E Lynn Usery,Abstract A general problem in combining road vector data with orthoimagery from differentsources is that they rarely align. There are a variety of causes to this problem; but the mostcommon one is that the latest products are collected with higher accuracy and improvedprocessing techniques. In previous work; we developed techniques to automatically correctthe alignment of vector data with orthoimagery using a technique called conflation. However;in applying our technique to real-world datasets provided by USGS; we discovered thatthese techniques failed in some areas. In this paper; we describe some refinements to ouroriginal approach that provide consistently better results in aligning the vector data with theorthoimagery.,Proceedings of the 2006 international conference on Digital government research,2006,*

Vicariously there: connected with our own and other characters,Tim Marsh; Kiyoung Yang; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract It is argued that the greater a user perceives him/herself to be vicariously incharacter or is able to empathize with other characters/humans; the more they have a senseof being connected to a mediated environment. The term coined to describe this sense ofuser engagement is “vicariously there”. In this article we provide a framework of vicariousand empathic experience in mediated environments and review previous work and theirmeasures. Focusing on three-dimensional interactive mediated environments (IME: digitalgames; virtual reality; virtual environments; etc.); we describe on-going research towards thedevelopment of ways to reason about the extent to which users feel a sense of engagementwith; or connection to; characters or users. Limitations of this work are identified and futureresearch directions towards an unobtrusive and continuous method are discussed.,Virtual Social Agents,2005,*

Querical Data Networks,Cyrus Shahabi; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani,Abstract Recently; a family of massive self-organizing data networks has emerged. Thesenetworks mainly serve as large-scale distributed query-processing systems. We term thesenetworks querical data networks (QDN). A QDN is a federation of a dynamic set of peer;autonomous nodes communicating through a transient-form interconnection. Data isnaturally distributed among the QDN nodes in extra-fine grain; where a few data items aredynamically created; collected; and/or stored at each node. Therefore; the network scaleslinearly to the size of the data set. With a dynamic data set; a dynamic and large set ofnodes; and a transient-form communication infrastructure; QDNs should be considered asthe new generation of distributed database systems with significantly less constrainingassumptions as compared to their ancestors.

Shape Similarity Matching Queries,Maytham H Safar; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract There are two categories of match queries: whole matching and partial matchingqueries. With whole matching; a query object is compared with a set of objects to find theones that are either exactly identical or similar to the query object. With partial matching;however; we are interested in finding the objects that have parts that match the query object.In this chapter; we concentrate on whole matching and do not discuss partial matching indetail. We focus on three variations of match queries (EM; RST; and SIM) to cover caseswhere the database is searched for exactly identical objects; identical objects that arerotation; scaling; and translation invariant (termed I-RST) or identical objects with a specifiedrotation angle (R); scaling factor (S); translation vector (T); or any combination of the three (S-RST); or similar objects per our definition of similarity.

Spatial Queries,Maytham H Safar; Cyrus Shahabi,This chapter presents the techniques used to answer spatial queries based on minimum boundingrectangle (M BR) approximation of ob- jects; and how it could be extended for minimum boundingcircles (M BG) approximations. In [64] topological relations between objects are studied basedon their minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs). In [25;63;66]; direction rela- tions between objectsare also studied based on M BRs. All of the studies based on M BR of objects use R-tree indexstructure to store and man- age the M BRs. They describe the direction relations between objectsbased on either the projection-based method [25! 63]; or cone-di1'ections method [66] .. For thisbook; since we investigate shape retrieval based on M BG; we also utilize the M BCs to answerspatial queries.

Image Description Techniques,Maytham H Safar; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract In the past few years; several applications in the areas of Multimedia informationsystems; CAD/CAM and computer graphics require to store and access large volumes ofmultimedia data such as images. Images can be associated with both low-level semantics(color; texture; shape; and various spatial constraints); and high-level semantics(correspondence between image objects and real-world objects).“In order to deal with theserich semantics of images; it is necessary to move from; image-level to object-levelinterpretation.”[91]. Therefore; a major data type stored and managed by these applicationsis the representation of two dimensional (2D) objects. Objects contain many features (eg;color; texture; shape; etc.) that have meaningful semantics. From those features; shape is animportant feature that conforms with the way human beings interpret and interact with the …,*,2003,*
Observations on MBC and MBR Approaches,Maytham H Safar; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract To expedite the processing of spatial queries; objects could be organized andindexed using the Sphere-tree index structure. Sphere-tree is a spatial access method usedfor storing and retrieving objects approximated by their MBCs; as opposed to the R-treewhich is used for objects approximated by their MBRs. However; in order to utilize Sphere-tree to index MBCs we need to address the mismatch between approximation relations andactual relations for intermediate nodes of the tree. Intuitively; since MBC approximations ofobjects are different than their MBR approximations; we expected that this would change therules of propagation in the intermediate nodes of Sphere-tree compared to those of R-tree.On the contrary; our investigations showed that the relations that may be satisfied betweenan intermediate node P and q'(so that the node be selected for propagation in the Sphere …,*,2003,*
Image Shape Features,Maytham H Safar; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Shape description or representation is an important issue in image analysis forobject recognition and classification. The descriptions are given in terms of properties ofobjects contained in images and in terms of relationships between such objects. Theseproperties correspond to characteristics of objects' position; size and shape. Each shape orimage to be stored in the database is processed to obtain the shape features. Shapefeatures are then used by the different shape representation techniques (see Chapters 4and 7) for organizing the useful shape information in index structures for efficient retrieval.For example; boundaries (connected edges) capture the characteristics of the shape object.Therefore; shapes can be processed to obtain their shape boundaries. Then; the shapeboundaries are automatically decomposed into a set of boundary points (interest points) …,*,2003,*

Evaluation Framework,Maytham H Safar; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract The shape of an object is an important feature for image and multimedia similarityretrievals; it conforms to the way human beings interpret and interact with the real worldobjects. The shape representation of objects can therefore be used for their indexing;retrieval; and as a similarity measure. However; as a consequence of uncertainty; shaperepresentation techniques sometimes work well only in certain applications; and theirperformance highly depends on the quality of the technique used to represent shapes.Therefore; in this chapter; we address key methodological issues for the evaluation of shaperetrieval methods with real data and under different scenarios. We describe several metricsand criterions to evaluate and compare the effectiveness and robustness of a given shaperetrieval method. The metrics can be used to compare the efficiency of the techniques in …,*,2003,*
MBC Optimization Techniques,Maytham H Safar; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract This chapter explains two optimization techniques [74] to further improve theperformance of MBC-based shape retrieval method in several aspects. First; we propose amore efficient algorithm to identify the minimum bounding circle (MBC) of an object; thatoperates only on a subset of the object's vertices. Second; we propose a new technique toimprove the response time of MBC-based methods for match queries under specifiedrotation angles. The technique relies on utilizing the symmetry property of the phase valuesof the Fourier transform of a real sequence under different rotations. The fundamentalobservations utilized by our techniques can be adapted and extended to be applicable toother frameworks and application domains.,*,2003,*
Alternative Image Description Techniques,Maytham H Safar; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract There is a variety of techniques that have been proposed in multimedia informationsystems area for shape representation [31; 41; 53]. Examples of those techniques areFourier descriptors method (FD)[31; 41; 75](based on objects' shape radii) and grid-basedmethod (GB)[50; 77](based on chain codes). They were used in some commercial systems[53] and as a basis for different comparison studies in [50; 53; 77; 78]. In addition; a newmethod based on a new r indexing technique (ie; Delau-nay triangulation—DT) wasproposed in [90]. With Delaunay triangu-lation; the shape features used are invariant underuniform translation; scaling; and rotation. However; with Delaunay triangulation; histogram--based representation is not very discriminative and is not unique; ie; objects of differentshapes may have the same feature point histogram representation.

Selective placement and replication strategies for storing audio clips in a naval application,Cyrus Shahabi; Latifur Khan,Reduced manning in the naval system requires that a given amount of tasks be performedfor time-critical and externally paced missions in an accurate and timely manner utilizingless number of personnel in a warship. The MultiModal WatchStation (MMWS) in navy shipsprovides a mechanism to aid in this endeavor. The focus of this study is on the storage andmanagement of audio clips generated by MMWS operators within and across the navyships. The generated audio clips must be stored in a persistent storage (ie; secondary andtertiary storage) in order to facilitate future query on the past messages. Since the persistentstorage is distributed across many sites (ie; ships); a query response time might beintolerable if the requested clips are not stored local to the party submitting the query.

Unlike other metrics computed from only the number of (unique) visits toa location; namely frequency; LE also captures the diversity of the users' visits; and is thusmore accurate than other metrics. Current solutions for computing LE require full access tothe past visits of users to locations; which poses privacy threats.

Prefetching Data for Optimizing Expensive Mediator Queries,Naveen Ashish; Craig Knoblock; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract In recent years; the information and data management community has been activelyinvolved in building\information mediators" which are systems that can integrate informationfrom multiple databases and Web sources. The query response time for mediators istypically quite high as the speed of the resulting application is heavily dependent on theremote (Web) sources being integrated. One of the successful approaches to optimizingmediator performance is to locally materialize data at the mediator side; by analyzing factorssuch as the distribution of user queries. In mediator environments we provide database likequery access for Web sources not originally designed for database like querying by buildingwrappers around Web sources. As a result certain kinds of queries can be quite expensivefor each source. In many cases locally materializing a small portion of data used in …,*,*,*

Feature Matrices: A Model for E7cient and Anonymous Mining of Web Navigations,Cyrus Shahabi; Farnoush Banaei-Kashani; Jabed Faruque; Adil Faisal,Abstract We propose a new model; which is a generalization of the Vector model; for efficientmining of web navigations. Recent growth of startup companies in the area of webnavigation mining is a strong indication of the effectiveness of this data in understandinguser behaviors. However; the approach taken by industry towards web navigation is off-lineand hence intrusive; static; and cannot differentiate between various roles a single usermight play. This is because on-line collection; preparation and analysis of the entire data iscumbersome (if not impossible) due to the large volume of clickstreams generated within apopular web-site. Towards this end; several researchers studied probabilistic (eg; Markov)and distance-based (eg; Vector) models to summarize (or compress) the collected data andmaintain only the important features for analysis.

BroadScale: Heterogeneous Scaling of Randomly Labeled Disks,Shu-Yuen Didi Yao; Cyrus Shahabi; Roger Zimmermann,Abstract Scalable storage architectures allow for the addition or removal of disks to increasestorage capacity and bandwidth or retire older disks. We introduce a random placementscheme for data blocks across a group of disks. Our objective is to redistribute a minimumnumber of blocks after disk scaling. In addition; after scaling; a balanced load should bemaintained and blocks should be retrievable in one disk access; with low computationalcomplexity. Past work have only addressed these requirements for scaling homogeneousdisks. Although maximizing the resources of heterogeneous disks have been previouslystudied; dynamic scaling was not considered. Heterogeneous disks must often be used forscaling since they are faster and more costeffective. Moreover; old homogeneous disks mayno longer be available.

Location Privacy and Autonomous Evaluation of Distance Queries in Mobile Sensor Networks,Cyrus Shahabi,With the advent of inexpensive Global Positioning System (GPS) devices; more and moresensor nodes and mobile devices are equipped with GPS and hence aware of their geo-coordinates. Once a node is aware of its coordination in space; it can ask questions aboutthe proximity of other nodes. A sample scenario in ad-hoc mobile devices is to find theclosest MP3 players from your PDA when riding on a bus. In geosensor networks; a sensornode needs to find the geo-coordinates of its neighbors in order to estimate the geospatialarea for which it is responsible to monitor some environmental phenomena such as soiltemperature. This area corresponds to the “weigh” of that sensor when computing (say) theweightedaverage temperature of the area covered by the sensors.

Performance Analysis of Audio-Based Similarity Queries Using Plustering,Latifur Khan; Mohammad Alshayeji; Ning Jiang; Cyrus Shahabi; Dennis McLeod,Abstract Many multimedia applications require the storage and retrieval of non-traditionaldata types such as audio; video and images. One important functionality required by theseapplications is the capability to find objects in a database that are similarto a given object.The comparison algorithms for multimedia data types are typically computationallyexpensive. Therefore; the performance of similarity queries can be improved significantly byreducing the number of invocations of these comparison algorithms. In this paper; wepropose the utilization of clustering techniques in order to reduce the number of invocationsof comparison algorithms. Although clustering improves the performance of similarityqueries; it might introduce inaccuracy in the results. We propose a family of similarity queryexecution techniques to strike a compromise between accuracy and performance. To …,*,*,*

UTGeR: A User-Independent Technique for Gesture Recognition,Cyrus Shahabi; Farid Parvini,Abstract We propose a novel approach for recognizing hand gestures by analyzing the datastreams generated by the sensors attached to the human hands. In our approach; weabstract out a signature for each gesture based on the 'range of motion'of the sensors (joints)involve in making that gesture. Since the relative range of motion of each joint compare toother joints is unique for a given gesture; it provides a unique signature for that gestureacross different users. Based on this observation; we propose our approach for handgesture recognition which addresses the major challenge of user-dependency. We applyour approach for recognizing ASL signs and show that we can recognize static ASL signswith no training. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate more than 75% accuracy in signrecognition for the ASL static signs.,*,*,*

Geospatial Data Integration,Cyrus Shahabi; Snehal Thakkar Sharifzadeh,Recent growth of the geo-spatial information on the web has made it possible to easilyaccess a wide variety of geo-spatial data. Accurately integrating diverse geo-spatial dataremains a challenging task; since geospatial data obtained from various data sources mayhave different projections; different accuracy levels; and different inconsistencies. One of themajor applications of integrating these data is to automatically identify objects; such as roadsor buildings; in the satellite imagery and annotate these objects with the information fromother data sources. GIS and computer vision researchers have worked on identifying objectsin the satellite imagery for a long time. However; the resulting algorithms take a largeamount of processing time and may produce inaccurate results. The goal of the project is thedesign and implementation of a novel information integration technique; which utilizes …,*,*,*
Improving Retrieval Cost by Choosing the Best Wavelet Decomposition for Multidimensional Datasets,Dimitris Sacharidis; Cyrus Shahabi; Huseyin Balli; Andreas Xeros; Antonio Ortega,Abstract Wavelets have been extensively used for approximate; progressive or even exactevaluation of queries. However; the complete wavelet transform is not always the optimalform to store the data. We exploit the properties of the full tree of the wavelet decomposition;in order to find a representation for the dataset that minimizes the retrieval cost assuming agiven query workload. We develop techniques to answer queries of range size r withretrieval cost of O (lognr); while maintaining an update cost of O (lognS); for a n-dimensionalcube of size S n. Furthermore; we investigate the space and time trade-off associated withstoring extra coefficients to reduce the cost even further.,*,*,*
