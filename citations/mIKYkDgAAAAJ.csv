Online aggregation for large mapreduce jobs,Niketan Pansare; Vinayak R Borkar; Chris Jermaine; Tyson Condie,ABSTRACT In online aggregation; a database system processes a user's aggregation queryin an online fashion. At all times during processing; the system gives the user an estimate ofthe final query result; with the confidence bounds that become tighter over time. In thispaper; we consider how online aggregation can be built into a MapReduce system for large-scale data processing. Given the MapReduce paradigm's close relationship with cloudcomputing (in that one might expect a large fraction of MapReduce jobs to be run in thecloud); online aggregation is a very attractive technology. Since large-scale cloudcomputations are typically pay-as-you-go; a user can monitor the accuracy obtained in anonline fashion; and then save money by killing the computation early once sufficientaccuracy has been obtained.,Proc.

The DataPath system: a data-centric analytic processing engine for large data warehouses,Subi Arumugam; Alin Dobra; Christopher M Jermaine; Niketan Pansare; Luis Perez,Abstract Since the 1970's; database systems have been" compute-centric". When acomputation needs the data; it requests the data; and the data are pulled through thesystem. We believe that this is problematic for two reasons. First; requests for data naturallyincur high latency as the data are pulled through the memory hierarchy; and second; itmakes it difficult or impossible for multiple queries or operations that are interested in thesame data to amortize the bandwidth and latency costs associated with their data access. Inthis paper; we describe a purely-push based; research prototype database system calledDataPath. DataPath is" data-centric". In DataPath; queries do not request data. Instead; dataare automatically pushed onto processors; where they are then processed by any interestedcomputation. We show experimentally on a multi-terabyte benchmark that this basic …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,91
SystemML: Declarative Machine Learning on Spark,Matthias Boehm; Michael Dusenberry; Deron Eriksson; Alexandre Evfimievski; Faraz Makari Manshadi; Niketan Pansare; Berthold Reinwald; Frederick Reiss; Prithviraj Sen; Arvind Surve; Shirish Tatikonda,Abstract The rising need for custom machine learning (ML) algorithms and the growing datasizes that require the exploitation of distributed; data-parallel frameworks such asMapReduce or Spark; pose significant productivity challenges to data scientists. ApacheSystemML addresses these challenges through declarative ML by (1) increasing theproductivity of data scientists as they are able to express custom algorithms in a familiardomain-specific language covering linear algebra primitives and statistical functions; and (2)transparently running these ML algorithms on distributed; data-parallel frameworks byapplying cost-based compilation techniques to generate efficient; low-level execution planswith in-memory single-node and large-scale distributed operations. This paper describesSystemML on Apache Spark; end to end; including insights into various optimizer and …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,20
Declarative Machine Learning - A Classification of Basic Properties and Types,Matthias Boehm; Alexandre Evfimievski; Niketan Pansare; Berthold Reinwald,Abstract: Declarative machine learning (ML) aims at the high-level specification of ML tasksor algorithms; and automatic generation of optimized execution plans from thesespecifications. The fundamental goal is to simplify the usage and/or development of MLalgorithms; which is especially important in the context of large-scale computations.However; ML systems at different abstraction levels have emerged over time andaccordingly there has been a controversy about the meaning of this general definition ofdeclarative ML. Specification alternatives range from ML algorithms expressed in domain-specific languages (DSLs) with optimization for performance; to ML task (learning problem)specifications with optimization for performance and accuracy. We argue that these differenttypes of declarative ML complement each other as they address different users (data …,ArXiv e-prints,2016,7
Topic models over spoken language,Niketan Pansare; Chris Jermaine; Peter Haas; Nitendra Rajput,Virtually all work on topic modeling has assumed that the topics are to be learned over a text-based document corpus. However; there exist important applications where topic modelsmust be learned over an audio corpus of spoken language. Unfortunately; speech-to-textprograms can have very low accuracy. We therefore propose a novel topic model for spokenlanguage that incorporates a statistical model of speech-to-text software behavior. Crucially;our model exploits the uncertainty numbers returned by the software. Our ideas apply to anydomain in which it would be useful to build a topic model over data in which uncertaintiesare explicitly represented.,Data Mining (ICDM); 2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on,2012,3
Social ranking for spoken web search,Shrey Sahay; Nitendra Rajput; Niketan Pansare,Abstract Spoken Web is an alternative Web for low-literacy users in the developing world.People can create audio content over phone and share on the Spoken Web. This enableseasy creation of locally relevant content. Even on the World Wide Web in developed regions;the recent increase in traffic is due to the locally relevant content created on socialnetworking sites. This paper argues that content search and ranking in the new scenarioneeds a re-look. The generic model of using in-links for ranking such content is not anappropriate measure of the content relevance in such a collaborative Web 2.0 world. Thispaper aims to bring the social context in Spoken Web ranking. We formulate a relationshipfunction between the query-creator and the content-creator and use this as one measure ofthe content relevance to the user. The relationship function uses the geographical …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,2

Deep Learning with Apache SystemML,Niketan Pansare; Michael Dusenberry; Nakul Jindal; Matthias Boehm; Berthold Reinwald; Prithviraj Sen,Abstract: Enterprises operate large data lakes using Hadoop and Spark frameworks that (1)run a plethora of tools to automate powerful data preparation/transformation pipelines;(2)run on shared; large clusters to (3) perform many different analytics tasks ranging frommodel preparation; building; evaluation; and tuning for both machine learning and deeplearning. Developing machine/deep learning models on data in such shared environmentsis challenging. Apache SystemML provides a unified framework for implementing machinelearning and deep learning algorithms in a variety of shared deployment scenarios.SystemML's novel compilation approach automatically generates runtime execution plansfor machine/deep learning algorithms that are composed of single-node and distributedruntime operations depending on data and cluster characteristics such as data size; data …,SysML,2018,*
Large-Scale Online Aggregation Via Distributed Systems,Niketan Pansare,From movie recommendations to fraud detection to personalized health care; there isgrowing need to analyze huge amounts of data quickly. To deal with huge amounts of data;many analysts use MapReduce; a software framework that parallelizes computations acrossa compute cluster. However; due to the sheer volume of data; MapReduce is sometimes stillnot fast enough to perform complicated analysis. In this thesis; I address this problem bydeveloping a statistical estimation framework on top of MapReduce to provide for interactivedata analysis. I present three projects I have worked on under this topic. In the first project; Iconsider extending Online Aggregation (OLA) to a MapReduce environment. Onlineaggregation (OLA) allows the user to compute an arbitrary aggregation function over a dataset and output probabilistic bounds on accuracy in online fashion. OLA in a relational …,*,2014,*
