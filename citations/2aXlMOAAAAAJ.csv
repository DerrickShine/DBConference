Fast subsequence matching in time-series databases,Christos Faloutsos; Mudumbai Ranganathan; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract We present an efficient indexing method to locate 1-dimensional subsequenceswithin a collection of sequences; such that the subsequences match a given (query) patternwithin a specified tolerance. The idea is to map each data sequences into a small set ofmultidimensional rectangles in feature space. Then; these rectangles can be readily indexedusing traditional spatial access methods; like the R*-tree [9]. In more detail; we use a slidingwindow over the data sequence and extract its features; the result is a trail in feature space.We propose an efficient and effective algorithm to divide such trails into sub-trails; which aresubsequently represented by their Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs). We alsoexamine queries of varying lengths; and we show how to handle each case efficiently. Weimplemented our method and carried out experiments on synthetic and real data (stock …,ACM sigmod record,1994,2161

Generalized Hirsch h-index for disclosing latent facts in citation networks,Antonis Sidiropoulos; Dimitrios Katsaros; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract What is the value of a scientist and its impact upon the scientific thinking? How canwe measure the prestige of a journal or a conference? The evaluation of the scientific workof a scientist and the estimation of the quality of a journal or conference has long attractedsignificant interest; due to the benefits by obtaining an unbiased and fair criterion. Although itappears to be simple; defining a quality metric is not an easy task. To overcome thedisadvantages of the present metrics used for ranking scientists and journals; JE Hirschproposed a pioneering metric; the now famous h-index. In this article we demonstrateseveral inefficiencies of this index and develop a pair of generalizations and effectivevariants of it to deal with scientist ranking and publication forum ranking.

A data mining approach for location prediction in mobile environments,Gökhan Yavaş; Dimitrios Katsaros; Özgür Ulusoy; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Mobility prediction is one of the most essential issues that need to be explored formobility management in mobile computing systems. In this paper; we propose a newalgorithm for predicting the next inter-cell movement of a mobile user in a PersonalCommunication Systems network. In the first phase of our three-phase algorithm; usermobility patterns are mined from the history of mobile user trajectories. In the second phase;mobility rules are extracted from these patterns; and in the last phase; mobility predictionsare accomplished by using these rules. The performance of the proposed algorithm isevaluated through simulation as compared to two other prediction methods. Theperformance results obtained in terms of Precision and Recall indicate that our method canmake more accurate predictions than the other methods.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2005,329
Tag recommendations based on tensor dimensionality reduction,Panagiotis Symeonidis; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form ofkeywords; to annotate and categorize information items (songs; pictures; web links; productsetc.). Collaborative tagging systems recommend tags to users based on what tags otherusers have used for the same items; aiming to develop a common consensus about whichtags best describe an item. However; they fail to provide appropriate tag recommendations;because:(i) users may have different interests for an information item and (ii) informationitems may have multiple facets. In contrast to the current tag recommendation algorithms;our approach develops a unified framework to model the three types of entities that exist in asocial tagging system: users; items and tags. These data is represented by a 3-order tensor;on which latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction is performed using the …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM conference on Recommender systems,2008,285

Algorithms for processing K-closest-pair queries in spatial databases,Antonio Corral; Yannis Manolopoulos; Yannis Theodoridis; Michael Vassilakopoulos,Abstract This paper addresses the problem of finding the K closest pairs between two spatialdatasets (the so-called; K closest pairs query; K-CPQ); where each dataset is stored in an R-tree. There are two different techniques for solving this kind of distance-based query. Thefirst technique is the incremental approach; which returns the output elements one-by-one inascending order of distance. The second one is the non-incremental alternative; whichreturns the K elements of the result all together at the end of the algorithm. In this paper;based on distance functions between two MBRs in the multidimensional Euclidean space;we propose a pruning heuristic and two updating strategies for minimizing the pruningdistance; and use them in the design of three non-incremental branch-and-bound algorithmsfor K-CPQ between spatial objects stored in two R-trees. Two of those approaches are …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2004,204
A unified framework for providing recommendations in social tagging systems based on ternary semantic analysis,Panagiotis Symeonidis; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords; toannotate and categorize items (songs; pictures; Web links; products; etc.). Social taggingsystems (STSs) can provide three different types of recommendations: They can recommend1) tags to users; based on what tags other users have used for the same items; 2) items tousers; based on tags they have in common with other similar users; and 3) users withcommon social interest; based on common tags on similar items. However; users may havedifferent interests for an item; and items may have multiple facets. In contrast to the currentrecommendation algorithms; our approach develops a unified framework to model the threetypes of entities that exist in a social tagging system: users; items; and tags.

Specifications for efficient indexing in spatiotemporal databases,Yannis Theodoridis; Timos Sellis; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,A new issue that arises in modern applications involves the efficient manipulation of (staticor moving) spatial objects; and the relationships among them. As a result; modern databasesystems should be able to efficiently support that type of data. Towards this goal; appropriateextensions of multidimensional access methods can be exploited in order to index andretrieve spatiotemporal objects; satisfying users' demands. This paper introduces the basicspecifications such a spatiotemporal index structure should follow; evaluates existingproposals with respect to the above specifications; and illustrates issues of interest involvingobject representation; query processing; and index maintenance.,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 1998.

Feature-based classification of time-series data,Alex Nanopoulos; Rob Alcock; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract: In this paper we propose the use of statistical features for time-series classi cation.The classi cation is performed with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network. Theproposed method is examined in the context of Control Chart Pattern data; which are timeseries used in Statistical Process Control. Experimental results verify the e ciency of thefeature-based classi cation method; compared to previous methods which classify timeseries based on the values of each time point. Moreover; the results show the robustness ofthe proposed method against noise and time-series length.,International Journal of Computer Research,2001,187
Performance of nearest neighbor queries in R-trees,Apostolos Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Nearest neighbor (NN) queries are posed very frequently in spatial applications.Recently a branch-and-bound algorithm based on R-trees has been developed in order toanswer efficiently NN queries. In this paper; we combine techniques that were inherentlyused for the analysis of range and spatial join queries; in order to derive measuresregarding the performance of NN queries. We try to estimate the number of disk accessesintroduced due to the processing of an NN query. Lower and upper bounds are definedestimating the performance of NN queries very closely. The theoretical analysis is verifiedwith experimental results; under uniform and non-uniform distributions of queries and data;in the 2-dimensional address space.,International Conference on Database Theory,1997,180

Effective prediction of web-user accesses: A data mining approach,Alexandros Nanopoulos; Dimitris Katsaros; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract The problem of predicting web-user accesses has recently attracted significantattention. Several algorithms have been proposed; which find important applications; likeuser profiling; recommender systems; web prefetching; design of adaptive web sites; etc. Inall these applications the core issue is the developement of an effective prediction algorithm.In this paper; we focus on web-prefetching; because of its importance in reducing userperceived latency present in every Web-based application.

Time-series similarity queries employing a feature-based approach,Robert J Alcock; Yannis Manolopoulos,1. SUMMARY Time-series; or time-sequence; data show the value of a parameter over time.A common query with time-series data is to find all sequences which are similar to a givensequence. The most common technique for evaluating similarity between two sequencesinvolves calculating the Euclidean distance between them. However; many examples canbe given where two similar sequences are separated by a large Euclidean distance. In thispaper; instead of calculating the Euclidean distance directly between two sequences; thesequences are transformed into a feature vector and the Euclidean distance between thefeature vectors is then calculated. Results show that this approach is superior for findingsimilar sequences.,7th Hellenic conference on informatics,1999,153

Energy-efficient distributed clustering in wireless sensor networks,Nikos Dimokas; Dimitrios Katsaros; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract The deployment of wireless sensor networks in many application areas requiresself-organization of the network nodes into clusters. Clustering is a network managementtechnique; since it creates a hierarchical structure over a flat network. Quite a lot of nodeclustering techniques have appeared in the literature; and roughly fall into two families:those based on the construction of a dominating set and those which are based solely onenergy considerations. The former family suffers from the fact that only a small subset of thenetwork nodes are responsible for relaying the messages; and thus cause rapidconsumption of the energy of these nodes. The latter family uses the residual energy of eachnode in order to decide about whether it will elect itself as a leader of a cluster or not. Thisfamily's methods ignore topological features of the nodes and are used in combination …,Journal of parallel and Distributed Computing,2010,126
Collaborative recommender systems: Combining effectiveness and efficiency,Panagiotis Symeonidis; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Recommender systems base their operation on past user ratings over a collectionof items; for instance; books; CDs; etc. Collaborative filtering (CF) is a successfulrecommendation technique that confronts the “information overload” problem. Memory-based algorithms recommend according to the preferences of nearest neighbors; and model-based algorithms recommend by first developing a model of user ratings. In this paper; webring to surface factors that affect CF process in order to identify existing false beliefs. Interms of accuracy; by being able to view the “big picture”; we propose new approaches thatsubstantially improve the performance of CF algorithms. For instance; we obtain more than40% increase in precision in comparison to widely-used CF algorithms. In terms ofefficiency; we propose a model-based approach based on latent semantic indexing (LSI) …,Expert Systems with Applications,2008,106
Cost models for distance joins queries using R-trees,Antonio Corral; Yannis Manolopoulos; Yannis Theodoridis; Michael Vassilakopoulos,Abstract The K-Closest-Pairs Query (K-CPQ); a type of distance join in spatial databases;discovers the K pairs of objects formed from two different datasets with the K smallestdistances. Recently; branch-and-bound algorithms based on R-trees have been developedin order to answer K-CPQs efficiently. For query optimization purposes; analytical modelsare needed to estimate the processing cost of a specific query in order to evaluatealternative execution plans. In this paper; we combine techniques that have been used forthe analysis of nearest neighbor and spatial join queries; and derive the performance cost(in terms of disk accesses) of K-CPQs using R-trees. Moreover; we present two interestingextensions of the cost model for K-CPQs; one exploiting the buffering management using R-trees and another for a second type of distance join; the so-called buffer queries.

Processing distance join queries with constraints,Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Distance join queries are used in many modern applications; such as spatialdatabases; spatiotemporal databases and data mining. One of the most common distancejoin queries is the closest-pair query (CPQ). Given two datasets DA and DB the CPQretrieves the pair (a; b); where a∈ DA and b∈ DB; having the smallest distance between allpairs of objects. An extension to this problem is to generate the k closest pairs of objects (k-CPQ). In several cases spatial constraints are applied; and object pairs that are retrievedmust also satisfy these constraints. Although the application of spatial constraints seemsnatural towards a more focused search; only recently they have been studied for the CPQproblem with the restriction that DA= DB. In this work; we focus on constrained closest-pairqueries; between two distinct datasets DA and DB; where objects from DA must be …,The Computer Journal,2006,103
Multi-way distance join queries in spatial databases,Antonio Corral; Yannis Manolopoulos; Yannis Theodoridis; Michael Vassilakopoulos,Abstract Let a tuple of n objects obeying a query graph (QG) be called the n-tuple. The “D_distance-value” of this n-tuple is the value of a linear function of distances of the n objectsthat make up this n-tuple; according to the edges of the QG. This paper addresses theproblem of finding the K n-tuples between n spatial datasets that have the smallest D_distance-values; the so-called K-multi-way distance join query (K-MWDJQ); where each setis indexed by an R-tree-based structure. This query can be viewed as an extension of K-closest-pairs query (K-CPQ)[8] for n inputs. In addition; a recursive non-incremental branch-and-bound algorithm following a depth-first search for processing synchronously all inputswithout producing any intermediate result is proposed. Enhanced pruning techniques arealso applied to n R-trees nodes in order to reduce the total response time and the number …,GeoInformatica,2004,103
Fast nearest-neighbor query processing in moving-object databases,Katerina Raptopoulou; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract A desirable feature in spatio-temporal databases is the ability to answer futurequeries; based on the current data characteristics (reference position and velocity vector).Given a moving query and a set of moving objects; a future query asks for the set of objectsthat satisfy the query in a given time interval. The difficulty in such a case is that both thequery and the data objects change positions continuously; and therefore we can not rely ona given fixed reference position to determine the answer. Existing techniques are eitherbased on sampling; or on repetitive application of time-parameterized queries in order toprovide the answer. In this paper we develop an efficient method in order to process nearest-neighbor queries in moving-object databases. The basic advantage of the proposedapproach is that only one query is issued per time interval. The time-parameterized R-tree …,GeoInformatica,2003,103
Musicbox: Personalized music recommendation based on cubic analysis of social tags,Alexandros Nanopoulos; Dimitrios Rafailidis; Panagiotis Symeonidis; Yannis Manolopoulos,Social tagging is becoming increasingly popular in music information retrieval (MIR). Itallows users to tag music items like songs; albums; or artists. Social tags are valuable toMIR; because they comprise a multifaced source of information about genre; style; mood;users' opinion; or instrumentation. In this paper; we examine the problem of personalizedmusic recommendation based on social tags. We propose the modeling of social taggingdata with three-order tensors; which capture cubic (three-way) correlations between users-tags-music items. The discovery of latent structure in this model is performed with the HigherOrder Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD); which helps to provide accurate andpersonalized recommendations; ie; adapted to the particular users' preferences.

Some recommender systems(Amazon. com; etc.) try to explain their recommendations; in an effort to regain customeracceptance and trust.

Transitive node similarity for link prediction in social networks with positive and negative links,Panagiotis Symeonidis; Eleftherios Tiakas; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Online social networks (OSNs) like Facebook; and Myspace recommend newfriends to registered users based on local features of the graph (ie based on the number ofcommon friends that two users share). However; OSNs do not exploit the whole structure ofthe network. Instead; they consider only pathways of maximum length 2 between a user andhis candidate friends. On the other hand; there are global approaches; which detect theoverall path structure in a network; being computationally prohibitive for huge-size socialnetworks. In this paper; we define a basic node similarity measure that captures effectivelylocal graph features. We also exploit global graph features introducing transitive nodesimilarity.

Mining patterns from graph traversals,Alexandros Nanopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract In data models that have graph representations; users navigate following the linksof the graph structure. Conducting data mining on collected information about user accessesin such models; involves the determination of frequently occurring access sequences. In thispaper; the problem of finding traversal patterns from such collections is examined. Thedetermination of patterns is based on the graph structure of the model. For this purpose;three algorithms; one which is level-wise with respect to the lengths of the patterns and twowhich are not are presented. Additionally; we consider the fact that accesses within patternsmay be interleaved with random accesses due to navigational purposes.

Fast and accurate link prediction in social networking systems,Alexis Papadimitriou; Panagiotis Symeonidis; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Online social networks (OSNs) recommend new friends to registered users basedon local-based features of the graph (ie based on the number of common friends that twousers share). However; OSNs do not exploit all different length paths of the network. Instead;they consider only pathways of maximum length 2 between a user and his candidate friends.On the other hand; there are global-based approaches; which detect the overall pathstructure in a network; being computationally prohibitive for huge-sized social networks. Inthis paper we provide friend recommendations; also known as the link prediction problem;by traversing all paths of a limited length; based on the “algorithmic small world hypothesis”.As a result; we are able to provide more accurate and faster friend recommendations. Wealso derive variants of our method that apply to different types of networks (directed …,Journal of Systems and Software,2012,73
Continuous monitoring of distance-based outliers over data streams,Maria Kontaki; Anastasios Gounaris; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Kostas Tsichlas; Yannis Manolopoulos,Anomaly detection is considered an important data mining task; aiming at the discovery ofelements (also known as outliers) that show significant diversion from the expected case.More specifically; given a set of objects the problem is to return the suspicious objects thatdeviate significantly from the typical behavior. As in the case of clustering; the application ofdifferent criteria lead to different definitions for an outlier. In this work; we focus on distance-based outliers: an object x is an outlier if there are less than k objects lying at distance atmost R from x. The problem offers significant challenges when a stream-based environmentis considered; where data arrive continuously and outliers must be detected on-the-fly.There are a few research works studying the problem of continuous outlier detection.However; none of these proposals meets the requirements of modern stream-based …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,73

It also agrees with theoretical and empirical results that the number of blocksdepends on the hypersurface of the hyperrectangle and not on its hypervolume. Thepractical use of the derived formula is that it allows the estimation of the space requirementsof the n-dimensional quadtree decomposition. Quadtrees are used extensively in two-dimensional spaces (geographic information systems and spatial databases in general); aswell in higher dimensionality spaces (as oct-trees for three-dimensional spaces; eg; ingraphics; robotics; and three-dimensional medical images). Our formula permits the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1997,70

Cdnsim: A simulation tool for content distribution networks,Konstantinos Stamos; George Pallis; Athena Vakali; Dimitrios Katsaros; Antonis Sidiropoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Content distribution networks (CDNs) have gained considerable attention in thepast few years. Hence there is need for developing frameworks for carrying out CDNsimulations. In this article we present a modeling and simulation framework for CDNs; calledCDNsim. CDNsim has been designated to provide a realistic simulation for CDNs;simulating the surrogate servers; the TCP/IP protocol; and the main CDN functions. Themain advantages of this tool are its high performance; its extensibility; and its user interface;which is used to configure its parameters. CDNsim provides an automated environment forconducting experiments and extracting client; server; and network statistics. The purpose ofCDNsim is to be used as a testbed for CDN evaluation and experimentation. This is quiteuseful to both the research community (to experiment with new CDN data management …,ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation (TOMACS),2010,64
Searching for similar trajectories in spatial networks,Eleftherios Tiakas; AN Papadopoulos; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos; Dragan Stojanovic; Slobodanka Djordjevic-Kajan,Abstract In several applications; data objects move on pre-defined spatial networks such asroad segments; railways; and invisible air routes. Many of these objects exhibit similarity withrespect to their traversed paths; and therefore two objects can be correlated based on theirmotion similarity. Useful information can be retrieved from these correlations and thisknowledge can be used to define similarity classes. In this paper; we study similarity searchfor moving object trajectories in spatial networks. The problem poses some importantchallenges; since it is quite different from the case where objects are allowed to move freelyin any direction without motion restrictions. New similarity measures should be employed toexpress similarity between two trajectories that do not necessarily share any common sub-path. We define new similarity measures based on spatial and temporal characteristics of …,Journal of Systems and Software,2009,64
Nearest-biclusters collaborative filtering based on constant and coherent values,Panagiotis Symeonidis; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Collaborative Filtering (CF) Systems have been studied extensively for more than adecade to confront the “information overload” problem. Nearest-neighbor CF is based eitheron similarities between users or between items; to form a neighborhood of users or items;respectively. Recent research has tried to combine the two aforementioned approaches toimprove effectiveness. Traditional clustering approaches (k-means or hierarchicalclustering) has been also used to speed up the recommendation process. In this paper; weuse biclustering to disclose this duality between users and items; by grouping them in bothdimensions simultaneously.

Nearest-biclusters collaborative filtering with constant values,Panagiotis Symeonidis; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Apostolos Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Collaborative Filtering (CF) Systems have been studied extensively for more than adecade to confront the “information overload” problem. Nearest-neighbor CF is based eitheron common user or item similarities; to form the user's neighborhood.

Edge betweenness centrality: A novel algorithm for QoS-based topology control over wireless sensor networks,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Alexis Papadimitriou; Dimitrios Katsaros; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract In this paper we propose a novel topology-control algorithm; called edgebetweenness centrality (EBC). EBC is based on the concept of betweenness centrality;which has been first introduced in the context of social network analysis (SNA); andmeasures the “importance” of each node in the network. This information allows us toachieve high quality of service (QoS) in wireless sensor networks by evaluatingrelationships between entities of the network (ie; edges); and hence identifying differentroles among them (eg; brokers; outliers); thus controlling information flow; message delivery;latency and energy dissipation among nodes. The experimental evaluation and analysis ofEBC in comparison to other state-of-the-art topology control algorithms shows that ouralgorithm outperforms the competitor ones in all observed cases.,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,2012,59
High performance; low complexity cooperative caching for wireless sensor networks,Nikos Dimokas; Dimitrios Katsaros; Leandros Tassiulas; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract During the last decade; Wireless Sensor Networks have emerged and matured atsuch point that they currently support several applications such as environment control;intelligent buildings; target tracking in battlefields. The vast majority of these applicationsrequire an optimization to the communication among the sensors so as to serve data in shortlatency and with minimal energy consumption. Cooperative data caching has beenproposed as an effective and efficient technique to achieve these goals concurrently. Theessence of these protocols is the selection of the sensor nodes which will take special rolesin running the caching and request forwarding decisions. This article introduces two newmetrics to aid in the selection of such nodes. Based on these metrics; we propose two newcooperative caching protocols; PCICC and scaPCICC; which are compared against the …,Wireless Networks,2011,57
MoviExplain: a recommender system with explanations,Panagiotis Symeonidis; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Providing justification to a recommendation gives credibility to a recommendersystem. Some recommender systems (Amazon. com etc.) try to explain theirrecommendations; in an effort to regain customer acceptance and trust. But theirexplanations are poor; because they are based solely on rating data; ignoring the contentdata.

A citation-based system to assist prize awarding,Antonis Sidiropoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Citation analysis is performed to evaluate the impact of scientific collections(journals and conferences); publications and scholar authors. In this paper we investigatealternative methods to provide a generalized approach to rank scientific publications. Weuse the SCEAS system [12] as a base platform to introduce new methods that can be usedfor ranking scientific publications. Moreover; we tune our approach along the reasoning ofthe prizes' VLDB 10 Year Award'and'SIGMOD Test of Time Award'; which have beenawarded in the course of the top two database conferences.

A new perspective to automatically rank scientific conferences using digital libraries,Antonis Sidiropoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Citation analysis is performed in order to evaluate authors and scientific collections;such as journals and conference proceedings. Currently; two major systems exist thatperform citation analysis: Science Citation Index (SCI) by the Institute for ScientificInformation (ISI) and CiteSeer by the NEC Research Institute. The SCI; mostly a manualsystem up until recently; is based on the notion of the ISI Impact Factor; which has beenused extensively for citation analysis purposes. On the other hand the CiteSeer system is anautomatically built digital library using agents technology; also based on the notion of ISIImpact Factor. In this paper; we investigate new alternative notions besides the ISI impactfactor; in order to provide a novel approach aiming at ranking scientific collections.Furthermore; we present a web-based system that has been built by extracting data from …,Information processing & management,2005,56
Feature-weighted user model for recommender systems,Panagiotis Symeonidis; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Recommender systems are gaining widespread acceptance in e-commerceapplications to confront the “information overload” problem. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is asuccessful recommendation technique; which is based on past ratings of users with similarpreferences. In contrast; Content-Based filtering (CB) assumes that each user operatesindependently. As a result; it exploits only information derived from document or itemfeatures. Both approaches have been extensively combined to improve the recommendationprocedure. Most of these systems are hybrid: they run CF on the results of CB and viceversa. CF exploits information from the users and their ratings. CB exploits information fromitems and their features. In this paper; we construct a feature-weighted user profile todisclose the duality between users and features.

Improved methods for signature-tree construction,Eleni Tousidou; Alex Nanopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Signature-based tree structures which have been proposed in the past do not perform wellfor large databases. The problem arises from the fact that they are incapable of pruningsearching; especially at the upper tree levels; and thus they have decreased selectivities. Inthis paper; we locate a number of reasons for this problem and propose several methods fornode splitting and partial-tree restructuring; which lead to improved query-response times.We have implemented all methods and we present experimental results; which indicate thatthe proposed methods are superior in all cases to the standard one and up to 5–10 timesbetter for medium and higher weights in inclusive (partial-match) queries. Additionally; wehave developed new functions for the performance estimation of signature trees which; incontrast to a previous estimation function; are able to take into account the outcome of …,The Computer Journal,2000,54
Prefetching in content distribution networks via web communities identification and outsourcing,Antonis Sidiropoulos; George Pallis; Dimitrios Katsaros; Konstantinos Stamos; Athena Vakali; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Content distribution networks (CDNs) improve scalability and reliability; byreplicating content to the “edge” of the Internet. Apart from the pure networking issues of theCDNs relevant to the establishment of the infrastructure; some very crucial datamanagement issues must be resolved to exploit the full potential of CDNs to reduce the “lastmile” latencies. A very important issue is the selection of the content to be prefetched to theCDN servers. All the approaches developed so far; assume the existence of adequatecontent popularity statistics to drive the prefetch decisions. Such information though; is notalways available; or it is extremely volatile; turning such methods problematic. To addressthis issue; we develop self-adaptive techniques to select the outsourced content in a CDNinfrastructure; which requires no apriori knowledge of request statistics.

On the generation of time-evolving regional data,Theodoros Tzouramanis; Michael Vassilakopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Benchmarking of spatio-temporal databases is an issue of growing importance. Incase large real data sets are not available; benchmarking requires the generation of artificialdata sets following the real-world behavior of spatial objects that change their locations;shapes and sizes over time. Only a few innovative papers have recently addressed the topicof spatio-temporal data generators. However; all existing approaches do not considerseveral important aspects of continuously changing regional data. In this report; a newgenerator; called generator of time-evolving regional data (G-TERD); for this class of data ispresented. The basic concepts that determine the function of G-TERD are the structure ofcomplex 2-D regional objects; their color; maximum speed; zoom and rotation-angle pertime slot; the influence of other moving or static objects on the speed and on the moving …,GeoInformatica,2002,50
Overlapping linear quadtrees and spatio-temporal query processing,Theodoros Tzouramanis; Michael Vassilakopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract In this paper; indexing in spatio-temporal databases by using the technique ofoverlapping is investigated. Overlapping has been previously applied in various accessmethods to combine consecutive structure instances into a single structure; without storingidentical sub-structures. In this way; space is saved without sacrificing time performance. Anew access method; overlapping linear quadtrees is introduced. This structure is able tostore consecutive historical raster images; a database of evolving images. Moreover; it canbe used to support query processing in such a database. Five such spatio-temporal queriesalong with the respective algorithms that take advantage of the properties of the newstructure are introduced. The new access method was implemented and extensiveexperimental studies for space efficiency and query processing performance were …,The Computer Journal,2000,50
R-trees have grown everywhere,Yannis Manolopoulos; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Theodoridis,Spatial data management has been an active area of intensive research for more than twodecades. In order to support spatial objects in a database system several issues should betaken into consideration such as: spatial data models; indexing mechanisms; efficient queryprocessing; cost models. One of the most influential access methods in the area is the R-treestructure proposed by Guttman in 1984 as an effective and efficient solution to indexrectangular objects in VLSI design applications. Since then; several variations of the originalstructure have been proposed towards: providing more efficient access; handling objects inhigh-dimensional spaces; supporting concurrent accesses; supporting I/O and CPUparallelism; efficient bulk-loading. It seems that due to the modern demanding applicationsand after the academia has paved the way; recently the industry recognized the use and …,*,2003,49
Signature-based structures for objects with set-valued attributes,Eleni Tousidou; Panayiotis Bozanis; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Aiming at the efficient retrieval of objects with set-valued attributes; we introducethree variations of a new method in order to satisfy subset and superset queries. Ourapproach is to combine the advantages of two access methods; that of linear Hashing and oftree-shaped methods; on which other similar methods have been previously reported aswell. Performance estimation analytical functions for each particular method are presented;followed by a thorough experimental comparison of all investigated structures; whereanalytical and experimental results deviate 10% on the average. Finally; the results of thisperformance evaluation are presented and discussed; clearly showing the superiority of thenew methods reaching an improvement of up to 85%.,Information Systems,2002,49
Skygraph: an algorithm for important subgraph discovery in relational graphs,Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Apostolos Lyritsis; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract A significant number of applications require effective and efficient manipulation ofrelational graphs; towards discovering important patterns. Some example applications are:(i)analysis of microarray data in bioinformatics;(ii) pattern discovery in a large graphrepresenting a social network;(iii) analysis of transportation networks;(iv) communitydiscovery in Web data. The basic approach followed by existing methods is to apply miningtechniques on graph data to discover important patterns; such as subgraphs that are likely tobe useful. However; in some cases the number of mined patterns is large; posing difficultiesin selecting the most important ones. For example; applying frequent subgraph mining on aset of graphs the system returns all connected subgraphs whose frequency is above aspecified (usually user-defined) threshold. The number of discovered patterns may be …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2008,48

Due to the nature of the PCS; the bandwidth allocationproblem arises; which is based on the notion of bandwidth-on-demand. We deal with theproblem of how to predict the position of a mobile client. We propose a new algorithm; calledDCP; to discover user mobility patterns from collections of recorded mobile trajectories anduse them for the prediction of movements and dynamic allocation of resources. Theperformance of the proposed algorithm is examined against two baseline algorithms. Thesimulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm achieves recall that is comparable tothat of the baseline algorithms and substantial improvement in precision.

A latency-based object placement approach in content distribution networks,George Pallis; Athena Vakali; Konstantinos Stamos; Antonis Sidiropoulos; Dimitrios Katsaros; Yannis Manolopoulos,Content distribution networks (CDNs) are increasingly being used to disseminate data intoday's Internet. The growing interest in CDNs is motivated by a common problem acrossdisciplines: how does one reduce the load on the origin server and the traffic on the Internet;and ultimately improve response time to users? In this direction; crucial data managementissues should be addressed. A very important issue is the optimal placement of theoutsourced content to CDN's servers. Taking into account that this problem is NP complete;a heuristic method should be developed. All the approaches developed so far assume theexistence of adequate popularity statistics. Such information though; is not always available;or it is extremely volatile; turning such methods problematic.

Hierarchical bitmap index: An efficient and scalable indexing technique for set-valued attributes,Mikołaj Morzy; Tadeusz Morzy; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Set-valued attributes are convenient to model complex objects occurring in the realworld. Currently available database systems support the storage of set-valued attributes inrelational tables but contain no primitives to query them efficiently. Queries involving set-valued attributes either perform full scans of the source data or make multiple passes oversingle-value indexes to reduce the number of retrieved tuples. Existing techniques forindexing set-valued attributes (eg; inverted files; signature indexes or RD-trees) are notefficient enough to support fast access of set-valued data in very large databases. In thispaper we present the hierarchical bitmap index—a novel technique for indexing set-valuedattributes. Our index permits to index sets of arbitrary length and its performance is notaffected by the size of the indexed domain.

Exploiting web log mining for web cache enhancement,Alexandros Nanopoulos; Dimitrios Katsaros; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Improving the performance of the Web is a crucial requirement; since its popularityresulted in a large increase in the user perceived latency. In this paper; we describe a Webcaching scheme that capitalizes on prefetching. Prefetching refers to the mechanism ofdeducing forthcoming page accesses of a client; based on access log information. Web logmining methods are exploited to provide effective prediction of Web-user accesses. Theproposed scheme achieves a coordination between the two techniques (ie; caching andprefetching). The prefetched documents are accommodated in a dedicated part of the cache;to avoid the drawback of incorrect replacement of requested documents. The requirementsof the Web are taken into account; compared to the existing schemes for buffer managementin database and operating systems.

Moving objects may exhibitsimilarity with respect to their traversed paths; and therefore two objects can be correlatedbased on their path similarity. In this paper; we study similarity search for moving objecttrajectories for spatial networks. The problem poses some important challenges; since it isquite different from the case where objects are allowed to move without motion restrictions.Experimental results performed on real-life spatial networks show that trajectory similaritycan be supported in an effective and efficient manner by using metric-based accessmethods,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2006.

Several organizations have developed very large market basket databases for themaintenance of customer transactions. New applications; eg; Web recommendationsystems; present the requirement for processing similarity queries in market basketdatabases. In this paper; we propose a novel scheme for similarity search queries in basketdata. We develop a new representation method; which; in contrast to existing approaches; isproven to provide correct results. New algorithms are proposed for the processing ofsimilarity queries. Extensive experimental results; for a variety of factors; illustrate thesuperiority of the proposed scheme over the state-of-the-art method.,The VLDB Journal,2002,41
From biological to social networks: Link prediction based on multi-way spectral clustering,Panagiotis Symeonidis; Nantia Iakovidou; Nikolaos Mantas; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Link prediction in protein–protein interaction networks (PPINs) is an important taskin biology; since the vast majority of biological functions involve such protein interactions.Link prediction is also important for online social networks (OSNs); which providepredictions about who is a friend of whom. Many link prediction methods for PPINs/OSNs arelocal-based and do not exploit all network structure; which limits prediction accuracy. On theother hand; there are global approaches to detect the overall path structure in a network;being computationally prohibitive for huge-size PPINs/OSNs. In this paper; we enhance apreviously proposed multi-way spectral clustering method by introducing new ways tocapture node proximity in both PPINs/OSNs. Our new enhanced method uses informationobtained from the top few eigenvectors of the normalized Laplacian matrix. As a result; it …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2013,40

Modificationoperations (ie insertions; deletions and updates) are allowed at the current version; whereasqueries are allowed to any temporal version; ie either in the current or in past versions.Using this structure; snapshot and range-timeslice queries can be answered optimally.However; the fundamental objective of the proposed method is to deliver efficientperformance in case of a general pure-key query (ie 'history of a key'). The trade-off is asmall increase in time cost for version operations and storage requirements.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,1999,40

A generalized taxonomy of explanations styles for traditional and social recommender systems,Alexis Papadimitriou; Panagiotis Symeonidis; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Recommender systems usually provide explanations of their recommendations tobetter help users to choose products; activities or even friends. Up until now; the type of anexplanation style was considered in accordance to the recommender system that employedit. This relation was one-to-one; meaning that for each different recommender systemscategory; there was a different explanation style category. However; this kind of one-to-onecorrespondence can be considered as over-simplistic and non generalizable. In contrast; weconsider three fundamental resources that can be used in an explanation: users; items andfeatures and any combination of them.

Continuous top-k dominating queries,Maria Kontaki; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Top-k dominating queries use an intuitive scoring function which ranks multidimensionalpoints with respect to their dominance power; ie; the number of points that a pointdominates. The k points with the best (eg; highest) scores are returned to the user. Both top-k and skyline queries have been studied in a streaming environment; where changes to thedata set are very frequent. In such an environment; continuous query processing techniquesare required toward efficient monitoring of query results; since periodic query re-execution iscomputationally intensive; and therefore; prohibitive. This work contains the first study ofcontinuous top-k dominating queries over data streams.

CDNs content outsourcing via generalized communities,Dimitrios Katsaros; George Pallis; Konstantinos Stamos; Athena Vakali; Antonis Sidiropoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Content distribution networks (CDNs) balance costs and quality in services related tocontent delivery. Devising an efficient content outsourcing policy is crucial since; based onsuch policies; CDN providers can provide client-tailored content; improve performance; andresult in significant economical gains. Earlier content outsourcing approaches may oftenprove ineffective since they drive prefetching decisions by assuming knowledge of contentpopularity statistics; which are not always available and are extremely volatile. This workaddresses this issue; by proposing a novel self-adaptive technique under a CDN frameworkon which outsourced content is identified with no a-priori knowledge of (earlier) requeststatistics. This is employed by using a structure-based approach identifying coherentclusters of" correlated" Web server content objects; the so-called Web page communities …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2009,37
Adaptive k-nearest-neighbor classification using a dynamic number of nearest neighbors,Stefanos Ougiaroglou; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos; Tatjana Welzer-Druzovec,Abstract Classification based on k-nearest neighbors (k NN classification) is one of the mostwidely used classification methods. The number k of nearest neighbors used for achieving ahigh accuracy in classification is given in advance and is highly dependent on the data setused. If the size of data set is large; the sequential or binary search of NNs is inapplicabledue to the increased computational costs. Therefore; indexing schemes are frequently usedto speed-up the classification process. If the required number of nearest neighbors is high;the use of an index may not be adequate to achieve high performance. In this paper; wedemonstrate that the execution of the nearest neighbor search algorithm can be interruptedif some criteria are satisfied. This way; a decision can be made without the computation of allk nearest neighbors of a new object.

Although bulk-loading techniques for accessmethods have been studied in the spatial database literature; parallel bulk-loading has notbeen addressed in a parallel spatial database context. Therefore; we study the problem ofparallel bulk-loading; assuming that an R-tree like access method need to be constructed;from a spatial relation that is distributed to a number of processors. Analytical cost modelsand experimental evaluation based on real-life and synthetic datasets demonstrate that theindex construction time can be reduced considerably by exploiting parallelism. I/O costs;CPU time and communication costs are taken into consideration in order to investigate theefficiency of the proposed algorithm.,Parallel Computing,2003,35
Similarity query processing using disk arrays,Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Similarity queries are fundamental operations that are used extensively in manymodern applications; whereas disk arrays are powerful storage media of increasingimportance. The basic trade-off in similarity query processing in such a system is thatincreased parallelism leads to higher resource consumptions and low throughput; whereaslow parallelism leads to higher response times. Here; we propose a technique which isbased on a careful investigation of the currently available data in order to exploit parallelismup to a point; retaining low response times during query processing. The underlying accessmethod is a variation of the R*-tree; which is distributed among the components of a diskarray; whereas the system is simulated using event-driven simulation. The performanceresults conducted; demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms by factors a …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1998,34
Using Repository of Repositories (RoRs) to study the growth of F/OSS projects: A meta-analysis research approach,Sulayman K Sowe; Lefteris Angelis; Ioannis Stamelos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Free/Open Source Software (F/OSS) repositories contain valuable data and theirusefulness in studying software development and community activities continues to attract alot of research attention. A trend in F/OSS studies is the use of metadata stored in arepository of repositories or RoRs. This paper utilizes data obtained from such RoRs-FLOSSmole-to study the types of projects being developed by the F/OSS community. Wedownloaded projects by topics data in five areas (Database; Internet; SoftwareDevelopment; Communications; and Games/Entertainment) from Flossmole's raw andsummary data of the sourceforge repository. Time series analysis show the numbers ofprojects in the five topics are growing linearly. Further analysis supports our hypothesis thatF/OSS development is moving “up the stack” from developer tools and infrastructure …,IFIP International Conference on Open Source Systems,2007,33
Indexing web access-logs for pattern queries,Alexandros Nanopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos; Maciej Zakrzewicz; Tadeusz Morzy,Abstract In this paper; we develop a new indexing method for large web access-logs. We areconcerned with pattern queries; which advocate the search for access sequences thatcontain certain query patterns. This kind of queries find applications in processing web-logmining results (eg; finding typical/atypical access-sequences). The proposed methodfocuses on scalability to web-logs' sizes. For this reason; we examine the gains due tosignature-trees; which can further improve the scalability to very large web-logs.Experimental results illustrate the superiority of the proposed method.,Proceedings of the 4th international workshop on Web information and data management,2002,33
Image indexing and retrieval using signature trees,Mario A Nascimento; Eleni Tousidou; Vishal Chitkara; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Significant research has focused on determining efficient methodologies foreffective and speedy retrieval in large image databases. Towards that goal; the firstcontribution of this paper is an image abstraction technique; called variable-bin allocation(VBA); based on signature bitstrings and a corresponding similarity metric. The signatureprovides a compact representation of an image based on its color content and yields betterretrieval effectiveness than when using classical global color histograms (GCHs) andcomparable to the one obtained when using color-coherence vectors (CCVs). Moreimportantly however; the use of VBA signatures allows savings of 75% and 87.5% in storageoverhead when compared to GCHs and CCVs; respectively. The second contribution is theimprovement upon an access structure; the S-tree; exploring the concept of logical and …,Data & knowledge engineering,2002,33
Indexed-based density biased sampling for clustering applications,Alexandros Nanopoulos; Yannis Theodoridis; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Density biased sampling (DBS) has been proposed to address the limitations ofUniform sampling; by producing the desired probability distribution in the sample. The easeof producing a random sample depends on the available mechanism for accessing theelements of the dataset. Existing DBS algorithms perform sampling over flat files. In thispaper; we develop a new method that exploits spatial indexes and the local densityinformation they preserve; to provide good quality of sampling result and fast access toelements of the dataset. With the proposed method accurate density estimations can beproduced with respect to factors like skew; noise or dimensionality. Moreover; significantimprovement in sampling time is attained. The performance of the proposed method isexamined analytically and experimentally. The comparative results illustrate its superiority …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2006,31
Multiple range query optimization in spatial databases,Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract In order to answer efficiently range queries in 2-d R-trees; first we sort queries bymeans of a space filling curve; then we group them together; and finally pass them forprocessing. Initially; we consider grouping of pairs of requests only; and give two algorithmswith exponential and linear complexity. Then; we generalize the linear method; groupingmore than two requests per group. We evaluate these methods under different LRU buffersizes; measuring the cache misses per query. We present experimental results based onreal and synthetic data. The results show that careful query scheduling can improvesubstantially the overall performance of multiple range query processing.,East European Symposium on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,1998,31
Dynamic inverted quadtree: A structure for pictorial databases,Michael Vassilakopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract We present a new structure; able to support and index a pictorial database. It is avariation of the region quadtree; termed Dynamic Inverted Quadtree; which is suitable foranswering queries based on image content (exact and fuzzy image pattern searching). Itexhibits certain advantages over the Fully Inverted Quadtree; an analogous structure thatcan be used for the same purposes. On the average it requires far less disk space; imagepattern searching is performed efficiently; it is dynamic; reorganization is not obligatory; itcan take place at any status of the structure and can be done on-line. Apart from thepresentation of the new structure; we describe the pattern searching algorithms and weanalyze the average space of the structure. Moreover; we compare analytically the spaceneeds of Fully and Dynamic Inverted Quadtrees; as well as two different storage order …,Information Systems,1995,31
Broadcast program generation for webcasting,Dimitrios Katsaros; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract The advances in computer and communication technologies have made possiblean ubiquitous computing environment were clients equipped with portable devices can sendand receive data anytime and from anyplace. In such an asymmetric communicationenvironment; data push has emerged as a very effective and scalable way to deliverinformation. Recently; the combination of push technology with the Internet and the Web[IEEE Trans. Comput. 50 (2001) 506; ACM/Kluwer Mobile Networks Appl. 7 (2002)67](referred to as Webcasting) has emerged “as a way out of the Web maze”. Any broadcastprogram employed for Webcasting must be able to scale to the large number of transmittedpages. We study the issue of creating hierarchical Webcasting programs. We propose a newalgorithm; CascadedWebcasting; for the generation of Webcasting programs; scalable in …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2004,30
Adaptive similarity search in streaming time series with sliding windows,Maria Kontaki; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract The challenge in a database of evolving time series is to provide efficient algorithmsand access methods for query processing; taking into consideration the fact that thedatabase changes continuously as new data become available. Traditional access methodsthat continuously update the data are considered inappropriate; due to significant updatecosts. In this paper; we use the IDC-Index (Incremental DFT Computation–Index); an efficienttechnique for similarity query processing in streaming time series. The index is based on amultidimensional access method enhanced with a deferred update policy and anincremental computation of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT); which is used as a featureextraction method. We focus both on range and nearest-neighbor queries; since both typesare frequently used in modern applications. An important characteristic of the proposed …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2007,29
Comparison of signature file models with superimposed coding,Dimitrios Dervos; Yannis Manolopoulos; P Linardis,Abstract The current study considers the superimposed coding variation of the signature filemethod (SC-SF). A number of issues which are not clearly specified in the literature areaddressed by adopting a unified approach which makes possible the comparison of two SC-SF models. Heuristic analytic derivations of earlier studies are shown to be valid by analysisand calculation. The study identifies a clear advantage of one model over the other; in a waywhich is quite the opposite to what has been suggested in the past.,Information Processing Letters,1998,29
Parallel processing of nearest neighbor queries in declustered spatial data,Apostolos Papadopoulos; Yanis Manolopoulos,Abstract In this paper; we propose an &cient solution to the problem of nearest neighborquery processing in decluste red spatial data. Recently a branch-and-bound nearestneighbor finding (BB-NNF) algorithm has been designed to process nearest neighborqueries in R-trees. However; this algorithm is strictly serial (branch-and-bound oriented) andits performance degrades if applied to a parallel environment; since it does not exploit anykind of parallelization. We develop an eEicient query processing strategy tir parallel nearestneighbor finding (P-NNF); assuming a shared nothing multi-processor architecture; wherethe processors i communicate via a network. In our method; the relevant: sites are activatedsimultaneously. In order to achieve this goal; statistical information is used. The dTiciencymcasurc is the response time of a given query.

Recommender systems for location-based social networks,Panagiotis Symeonidis; Dimitrios Ntempos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Social networking sites; such as Facebook and LinkedIn; have attracted a huge attentionafter the widespread adoption of Web 2.0 technology. These systems contain data; whichcan be mined and used for making personalized predictions and recommendations ofproducts; users and digital content. In particular; they collect information from users' socialcontacts and their interactions (co-tagging of photos; co-rating of products etc.) and makerecommendations of products or even people to users based on their common friends;common commenting on written posts etc. Mobile communication devices reach now everycorner of planet earth. People are inextricably linked to the internet through mobile devicesthat allow ubiquitous and pervasive computing.

Web caching in broadcast mobile wireless environments,Dimitrios Katsaros; Yannis Manolopoulos,Effectively exploiting available communication bandwidth and client resources is vital inwireless mobile environments. One technique for doing so is client-side data caching; whichhelps reduce latency and conserve network resources. The SliCache generic self-tunablecache-replacement policy addresses these issues by using intelligent slicing of the cachespace and novel methods for selecting which objects to purge. Performance evaluationsshow that SliCache improves mobile clients' access to Web objects compared to othercommon policies.,IEEE Internet Computing,2004,26
Distributed processing of similarity queries,Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Many modern applications in diverse fields demand the efficient manipulation ofvery large multidimensional datasets. It is evident; that efficient and effective queryprocessing techniques need to be developed; in order to provide acceptable response timesin query processing. In this paper; we study the processing of similarity nearest neighborqueries in large distributed multidimensional databases; where objects are represented asvectors in a vector space; and are distributed in a multi-computer environment. Thedeparture from the centralized case embodies a number of advantages and (unfortunately) anumber of difficulties that need to be successfully overcome. In this perspective; four queryevaluation strategies are presented; namely Concurrent Processing (CP); SelectiveProcessing (SP); Two-Phase Processing (2PP) and Probabilistic Processing (PRP).

Algorithms for joining R-trees and linear region quadtrees,Antonio Corral; Michael Vassilakopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract The family of R-trees is suitable for storing various kinds of multidimensional objectsand is considered an excellent choice for indexing a spatial database. Region Quadtreesare suitable for storing 2-dimensional regional data and their linear variant is used in manyGeographical Information Systems for this purpose. In this report; we present five algorithmssuitable for processing join queries between these two successful; although very different;access methods. Two of the algorithms are based on heuristics that aim at minimizing I/Ocost with a limited amount of main memory. We also present the results of experimentsperformed with real data that compare the I/O performance of these algorithms.,International Symposium on Spatial Databases,1999,25
Topology control algorithms for wireless sensor networks: a critical survey,Yannis Manolopoulos; Dimitrios Katsaros; Alexis Papadimitriou,Abstract In a densely deployed wireless sensor network; a single node has manyneighbouring nodes with which direct communication would be possible when usingsufficiently large transmission power. This is; however; not beneficial; high transmissionpower requires lots of energy; many neighbours are a burden for a MAC protocol; androuting protocols suffer from volatility in the network when nodes move around. To overcomethese problem topology control can be applied. The idea is to deliberately restrict the set ofnodes that are considered neighbours of a given node. This article surveys the most popularand efficient topology control algorithms for wireless ad hoc sensor networks.,Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Computer Systems and Technologies and Workshop for PhD Students in Computing on International Conference on Computer Systems and Technologies,2010,24
Cache consistency in wireless multimedia sensor networks,Nikos Dimokas; Dimitrios Katsaros; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract The production of cheap CMOS cameras; which are able to capture rich multimediacontent; combined with the creation of low-power circuits; gave birth to what is calledWireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs). WMSNs introduce several new researchchallenges; mainly related to mechanisms to deliver application-level Quality-of-Service (eg;latency minimization). Such issues have almost completely been ignored in traditionalWSNs; where the research focused on energy consumption minimization. Towardsachieving this goal; the technique of cooperative caching multimedia content in sensornodes can efficiently address the resource constraints; the variable channel capacity and thein-network processing challenges associated with WMSNs. The technological advances ingigabyte-storage flash memories make sensor caching to be the ideal solution for latency …,Ad Hoc Networks,2010,24
Mining association rules in very large clustered domains,Alexandros Nanopoulos; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Emerging applications introduce the requirement for novel association-rule miningalgorithms that will be scalable not only with respect to the number of records (number ofrows) but also with respect to the domain's size (number of columns). In this paper; we focuson the cases where the items of a large domain correlate with each other in a way that smallworlds are formed; that is; the domain is clustered into groups with a large number of intra-group and a small number of inter-group correlations. This property appears in several real-world cases; eg; in bioinformatics; e-commerce applications; and bibliographic analysis; andcan help to significantly prune the search space so as to perform efficient association-rulemining. We develop an algorithm that partitions the domain of items according to theircorrelations and we describe a mining algorithm that carefully combines partitions to …,Information Systems,2007,24
Node clustering in wireless sensor networks by considering structural characteristics of the network graph,Nikos Dimokas; Dimitrios Katsaros; Yannis Manolopoulos,The deployment of wireless sensor networks in many application areas; eg; aggregationservices; requires self-organization of the network nodes into clusters. Quite a lot of nodeclustering techniques have appeared in the literature; and roughly fall into two families;those based on the construction of a dominating set and those which are based solely onenergy considerations. The former family suffers from the fact that only a small subset of thenetwork nodes are responsible for relaying the messages; and thus cause rapidconsumption of the energy of these nodes. The later family uses the residual energy of eachnode in order to direct its decision about whether it will elect itself as a leader of a cluster ornot. This family's methods ignore topological features of the nodes and are used incombination with the methods of the former family. We propose a novel distributed …,Information Technology; 2007.

Friendlink: link prediction in social networks via bounded local path traversal,Alexis Papadimitriou; Panagiotis Symeonidis; Yannis Manolopoulos,Online social networks (OSNs) like Facebook; Myspace; and Hi5 have become popular;because they allow users to easily share content or expand their social circle. OSNsrecommend new friends to registered users based on local graph features (ie based on thenumber of common friends that two users share). However; OSNs do not exploit all differentlength paths of the network. Instead; they consider only pathways of maximum length 2between a user and his candidate friends. On the other hand; there are global approaches;which detect the overall path structure in a network; being computationally prohibitive forhuge-size social networks. In this paper; we provide friend recommendations; also known asthe link prediction problem; by traversing all paths of a bounded length; based on the“algorithmic small world hypothesis”. As a result; we are able to provide more accurate …,Computational Aspects of Social Networks (CASoN); 2011 International Conference on,2011,23
Collaborative filtering: Fallacies and insights in measuring similarity,Panagiotis Symeonidis; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Nearest-neighbor collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms are gaining widespread acceptancein recommender systems and e-commerce applications. These algorithms providerecommendations for products; based on suggestions of users with similar preferences. Oneof the most crucial factors in the effectiveness of nearest-neighbor CF algorithms is thesimilarity measure that is used. The most popular measures are the Pearson correlation andcosine similarity. In this paper; we identify existing fallacies in the calculation of thesemeasures. We propose a novel approach; which addresses the problem and substantiallyimproves the accuracy of CF results. Moreover; we propose an evaluation procedure thatproduces reliable conclusions about the performance of nearest-neighbor CF algorithms.Through the proposed evaluation procedure; our experimental results identify the …,*,2006,23

One of theimperative challenges is how to search these vast; global-scale musical resources to findpreferred music. Recent research has envisaged the notion of music search engines (MSEs)that allow for searching preferred music over the Web.

Continuous trend-based clustering in data streams,Maria Kontaki; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Trend analysis of time series is an important problem since trend identificationenables the prediction of the near future. In streaming time series the problem is morechallenging due to the dynamic nature of the data. In this paper; we propose a method tocontinuously clustering a number of streaming time series based on their trendcharacteristics. Each streaming time series is transformed to a vector by means of thePiecewise Linear Approximation (PLA) technique. The PLA vector comprises pairs of values(timestamp; trend) denoting the starting time of the trend and the type of the trend (either UPor DOWN) respectively. A distance metric for PLA vectors is introduced. We propose splitand merge criteria to continuously update the clustering information. Moreover; theproposed method handles outliers.

Finding maximum-length repeating patterns in music databases,Ioannis Karydis; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract This paper introduces the problem of discovering maximum-length repeatingpatterns in music objects. A novel algorithm is presented for the extraction of this kind ofpatterns from a melody music object. The proposed algorithm discovers all maximum-lengthrepeating patterns using an “aggressive” accession during searching; by avoiding costlyrepetition frequency calculation and by examining as few as possible repeating patterns inorder to reach the maximum-length repeating pattern (s).

Caching in Web memory hierarchies,Dimitrios Katsaros; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Web cache replacement algorithms have received a lot of attention during the pastyears. Though none of the proposed algorithms deals efficiently with all the particularities ofthe Web environment; namely; relatively weak temporal locality (due to filtering effects ofcaching hierarchies); heterogeneity in size and origin of request streams. In this paper; wepresent the CRF replacement policy; whose development is mainly motivated by two factors.The first is the filtering effects of Web caching hierarchies and the second is the intention ofachieving a balance between hit and byte hit rates. CRF's decisions for replacement arebased on a combination of the recency and frequency criteria in a way that requires notunable parameters.,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2004,22
Continuous outlier detection in data streams: an extensible framework and state-of-the-art algorithms,Dimitrios Georgiadis; Maria Kontaki; Anastasios Gounaris; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Kostas Tsichlas; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Anomaly detection is an important data mining task; aiming at the discovery ofelements that show significant diversion from the expected behavior; such elements aretermed as outliers. One of the most widely employed criteria for determining whether anelement is an outlier is based on the number of neighboring elements within a fixed distance(R); against a fixed threshold (k). Such outliers are referred to as distance-based outliers andare the focus of this work. In this demo; we show both an extendible framework for outlierdetection algorithms and specific outlier detection algorithms for the demanding case whereoutlier detection is continuously performed over a data stream.

The data set that is used in this work is a GPS trajectoryof some users; which is gathered over 2 years. In order to have more accurate predictionsand recommendations; we present a model that injects additional information to the maindata set and we aim to apply a mathematical method on the merged data.

Horizontal and vertical integration/segregation in auditory streaming: a voice separation algorithm for symbolic musical data,Ioannis Karydis; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Apostolos Papadopoulos; Emilios Cambouropoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract—Listeners are thought to be capable of perceiving multiple voices in music.Adopting a perceptual view of musical 'voice'that corresponds to the notion of auditorystream; a computational model is developed that splits a musical score (symbolic musicaldata) into different voices. A single 'voice'may consist of more than one synchronous notesthat are perceived as belonging to the same auditory stream; in this sense; the proposedalgorithm; may separate a given musical work into fewer voices than the maximum numberof notes in the greatest chord (eg a piece consisting of four or more concurrent notes may beseparated simply into melody and accompaniment). This is paramount; not only in the studyof auditory streaming per se; but also for developing MIR systems that enable patternrecognition and extraction within musically pertinent 'voices'(eg melodic lines).

Progressive processing of subspace dominating queries,Eleftherios Tiakas; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract A top-k dominating query reports the k items with the highest domination score.Algorithms for efficient processing of this query have been recently proposed in theliterature. Those methods; either index based or index free; apply a series of pruning criteriatoward efficient processing. However; they are characterized by several limitations; such as(1) they lack progressiveness (they report the k best items at the end of the processing);(2)they require a multi-dimensional index or they build a grid-based index on-the-fly; whichsuffers from performance degradation; especially in high dimensionalities; and (3) they donot support vertically decomposed data. In this paper; we design efficient algorithms that canhandle any subset of the dimensions in a progressive manner. Among the studiedalgorithms; the Differential Algorithm shows the best overall performance.,The VLDB Journal,2011,20

The impact of buffering on closest pairs queries using r-trees,Antonio Corral; Michael Vassilakopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract In this paper; the most appropriate buffer structure; page replacement policy andbuffering scheme for closest pairs queries; where both spatial datasets are stored in R-trees;are investigated. Three buffer structures (ie single; hybrid and by levels) over two bufferingschemes (ie local to each R-tree; and global to the query) using several page replacementalgorithms (eg FIFO; LRU; 2Q; etc.) are studied. In order to answer K closest pair queries (K-CPQs; with K≥ 1) we employ recursive and non-recursive (iterative) branch-and-boundalgorithms. The outcome of this study is the derivation of the outperforming configuration (interms of buffer structure; page replacement algorithm and buffering scheme) for CPQs. In allcases; the savings in disk accesses is larger for a recursive algorithm than for a non-recursive one; in the presence of buffer space.

These micro sensor nodes; whosecapabilities have skyrocketed over the last couple of years; have allowed for a wide range ofapplications to be created; applications that not so long ago would seem impossible;impractical and time-consuming. It would only be logical to expect that researchers fromother fields would take an interest in sensor networks; hence expanding the already widevariety of algorithms; theoretical proofs and applications that existed beforehand.

Continuous k-dominant skyline computation on multidimensional data streams,Maria Kontaki; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Skyline queries are important due to their usefulness in many application domains.However; by increasing the number of attributes; the probability that a tuple dominatesanother one is reduced significantly. To attack this problem; k-dominant skylines have beenproposed; relaxing the definition of domination. In this paper; we study the problem ofcontinuous monitoring of k-dominant skylines; where multiple queries are runningconcurrently. The proposed method divides the space in pairs of attributes. For each pair; wecompute skyline tuples and we exploit them to eliminate candidates tuples of the queriesand we combine the partial results. The proposed scheme uses only simple dominationchecks and it is applicable to the streaming case as well as to ad-hoc insertions anddeletions.

User ratings are notexpected to be independent; as users follow trends of similar rating behavior. In terms ofText Mining; this is analogous to the formation of higher-level concepts from plain terms. Inthis paper; we propose a novel CF algorithm which uses Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) todetect rating trends and performs recommendations according to them.

Fast mining of frequent tree structures by hashing and indexing,Dimitrios Katsaros; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Hierarchical semistructured data arise frequently in the Web; or in biologicalinformation processing applications. Semistructured objects describing the same type ofinformation have similar but not identical structure. Usually they share some common'schema'. Finding the common schema of a collection of semistructured objects is a veryimportant task and due to the huge amount of such data encountered; data miningtechniques have been employed. In this paper; we study the problem of discoveringfrequently occurring structures in semistructured objects using the notion of associationrules. We identify that discovering the frequent structures in the early phases of the miningprocedure is the dominant cost and we provide a fast algorithm addressing this issue.

Continuous processing of preference queries in data streams,Maria Kontaki; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Preference queries have received considerable attention in the recent past; due totheir use in selecting the most preferred objects; especially when the selection criteria arecontradictory. Nowadays; a significant number of applications require the manipulation oftime evolving data and therefore the study of continuous query processing has recentlyattracted the interest of the data management community. The goal of continuous queryprocessing is to continuously evaluate long-running queries by using incremental algorithmsand thus to avoid query evaluation from scratch; if possible. In this paper; we examine thecharacteristics of important preference queries; such as skyline; top-k and top-k dominatingand we review algorithms proposed for the evaluation of continuous preference queriesunder the sliding window streaming model.,International Conference on Current Trends in Theory and Practice of Computer Science,2010,18
Audit‐firm group appointment: an artificial intelligence approach,Efstathios Kirkos; Charalambos Spathis; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Auditor appointment can be regarded as a matter of pursued audit quality and isdriven by several factors. The adoption of an effective auditor procurement processincreases the likelihood that a company will engage the right auditor at a fair price. In thisstudy; three techniques derived from artificial intelligence (AI) are used to propose modelscapable of discriminating between cases where companies appoint a Big 4 or a Non-Big 4auditor. These three AI methods are then compared with the broadly used method of logisticregression. The results indicate that two of the AI techniques outperform logistic regression.In addition; one method further improves its performance by applying bagging. Finally;significant factors associated with auditor appointment are revealed. Copyright© 2009 JohnWiley & Sons; Ltd.,Intelligent Systems in Accounting; Finance and Management,2010,18
The basis system: a benchmarking approach for spatial index structures,Christophe Gurret; Yannis Manolopoulos; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Philippe Rigaux,Abstract This paper describes the design of the BASIS prototype system. BASIS stands for Benchmarking A pproach for S patial I ndex S tructures. It is a prototype system aiming atperformance evaluation of spatial access methods and query processing strategies; underdifferent data sets; various query types; and different workloads. BASIS is based on amodular architecture; composed of a simple storage manager; a query processor; and a setof algorithmic techniques to facilitate benchmarking. The main objective of BASIS istwofold:(i) to provide a benchmarking environment for spatial access methods and relatedquery evaluation techniques; and (ii) to allow comparative studies of spatial access methodsin different cases but under a common framework. We currently extend it to support thefundamental features of spatiotemporal data management and access methods.,*,1999,18
Indexing time-series databases for inverse queries,Alexandras Nanopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract In this paper we examine the problem of indexing time sequences in order toanswer inverse queries. An inverse query computes all the time points at which thesequence contains values equal to the query value. The presented method is based on [7] inorder to represent each time sequence with a few ranges of values; which are in fact onedimensional minimum bounding rectangles. We compare the proposed method with the IP-index which has been presented in [8] as an indexing mechanism for answering inversequeries. As it is shown; the proposed method outperforms the IP-index for very large timesequences.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,1998,18
Performance of a two-headed disk system when serving database queries under the scan policy,Yannis Manolopoulos; John G.  Kollias,Abstract Disk drives with movable two-headed arms are now commercially available. Thetwo heads are separated by a fixed number of cylinders. A major problem for optimizing diskhead movement; when answering database requests; is the specification of the optimumnumber of cylinders separating the two heads. An earlier analytical study assumed a FCFSmodel and concluded that the optimum separation distance should be equal to 0.44657 ofthe number of cylinders N of the disk. This paper considers that the SCAN scheduling policyis used in file access; and it applies combinatorial analysis to derive exact formulas for theexpected head movement. Furthermore; it is proven that the optimum separation distance isN/2-1 (⌈ N/2-1⌉ and⌊ N/2-1⌋) if N is even (odd). In addition; a comparison with a single-headed disk system operating under the same scheduling policy shows that if the two …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1989,18
R-trees: A dynamic index structure for spatial searching,Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Yannis Manolopoulos; Yannis Theodoridis; Vassilis J Tsotras,The R*-tree; an improvement of the R-tree; is one of the most popular access methods forpoints and rectangles. This is achieved by modifying the insert and split algorithms of theoriginal R-tree which is based on the heuristic optimization of the area of the enclosingrectangle in each inner node. The R*-tree incorporates a combined optimization of area;margin and overlap of each enclosing rectangle in the directory. From a practical point ofview; the R*-tree is very attractive because of the following two reasons. It efficiently supportspoint and spatial data at the same time and its implementation cost is only slightly higherthan that of other R-tree variants.,*,2017,17
Geo-social recommendations,Alexis Papadimitriou; Panagiotis Symeonidis; Yannis Manolopoulos,ABSTRACT Social networks have evolved with the combination of geographical data; intoGeo-social networks (GSNs). GSNs give users the opportunity; not only to communicate witheach other; but also to share images; videos; locations; and activities. The latestdevelopments in GSNs incorporate the usage of location tracking services; such as GPS toallow users to “check-in” at various locations and record their experience. In particular; userssubmit ratings or personal comments for their location/activity. The vast amount of data thatis being generated by users with GPS devices; such as mobile phones; needs efficientmethods for its effective management. In this paper; we have implemented an onlineprototype system; called GeoSocial Recommender System; where users can getrecommendations on friends; locations and activities.

Justified recommendations based on content and rating data,Panagiotis Symeonidis; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract. Providing justification to a recommendation gives credibility to a recommendersystem. Some recommender systems (Amazon. com etc.) try to explain theirrecommendations; in an effort to regain customer acceptance and trust. But theirexplanations are poor and unjustified; because they are based solely on rating ornavigational data; ignoring the content data. In this paper; we propose a novel approach thatattains simultaneously accurate and justifiable recommendations. We construct a featureprofile for the users; to reveal their favorite features. Moreover; we create biclusters (ie groupof users which exhibit highly correlated ratings on groups of items) to exploit partial matchingbetween the preferences of the test user and each community of users. We have evaluatedthe quality of our justifications with an objective metric in a real data set; showing the …,WebKDD Workshop on Web Mining and Web Usage Analysis,2008,17
Symbolic musical genre classification based on repeating patterns,Ioannis Karydis; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract This paper presents a genre classification algorithm for music data. The proposedmethodology relies on note pitch and duration features; derived from the repeating terns andduration histograms of a musical piece; respectively. Note-information histograms have agreat capability in capturing a fair amount of information regarding harmonic as well asrhythmic features of different musical genres and pieces; while repeating patterns refer tosegments of the piece that are semantically important. Detailed experimental results on intra-classical genres illustrate the significant performance gains due to the proposed features.,Proceedings of the 1st ACM workshop on Audio and music computing multimedia,2006,17
External balanced regular (x-BR) trees: new structures for very large spatial databases,Michael Vassilakopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract The External Balanced Regular (x-BR) Trees constitute a family of new secondarymemory structures which are suitable for storing and indexing multi-dimensional points andline segments. In 2 dimensions; the resulting structure is an External Balanced Quadtree; in3 dimensions an External Balances Octtree; and in higher dimensions an External BalancedHyper-quadtree. The main characteristic of all these structures is that they subdivide space(in an hierarchical and regular fashion) into disjoint regions. These spatial access methodsare fully dynamic; while insertions are not complicated to program and affect only one pathin the tree. Moreover; x-BR trees are variable resolution structures. That is; the number ofspace subdivisions is not predefined; making these structures suitable for very largeamounts of data. Due to the balanced nature of these structures and the disjointness of …,*,2000,17
Efficiency Analysis of Overlapped Quadtrees,Michael Vassilakopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos; Brigitte Kroell,Abstract The technique of overlapping region quadtrees results in signi cant spacereduction. This new form of data structure is suitable for representing sequences of similarbinary raster images emerging in many areas. Apart from a short introduction to the methodof overlapping; an analysis of the space reduction achieved is presented in this article. First;a general theorem about the average number of common nodes of two images obeying ageneral model is given. Next; two models of image similarity are introduced and therespective formulae are derived from the general one. Evaluating these formulae for variousparameters shows the e ciency of overlapping.,Nordic Journal of Computing,1995,17
Domination mining and querying,Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Apostolos Lyritsis; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Pareto dominance plays an important role in diverse application domains such aseconomics and e-commerce; and it is widely being used in multicriteria decision making. Inthese cases; objectives are usually contradictory and therefore it is not straightforward toprovide a set of items that are the “best” according to the user's preferences. Skyline querieshave been extensively used to recommend the most dominant items. However; in somecases skyline items are either too few; or too many; causing problems in selecting theprevailing ones. The number of skyline items depend heavily on both the data distribution;the data population and the dimensionality of the data set. In this work; we provide adominance-based analysis and querying scheme that aims at alleviating the skylinecardinality problem; trying to introduce ranking on the items.

Benchmarking access methods for time-evolving regional data,Theodoros Tzouramanis; Michael Vassilakopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract In this paper we present a performance comparison of access methods for time-evolving regional data. Initially; we briefly review four temporal extensions of the LinearRegion Quadtree: the Time-Split Linear Quadtree; the Multiversion Linear Quadtree; theMultiversion Access Structure for Evolving Raster Images and Overlapping LinearQuadtrees. These methods comprise a family of specialized access methods that canefficiently store and manipulate consecutive raster images. A new simpler implementationsolution that provides efficient support for spatio-temporal queries referring to the pastthrough these methods; is suggested.

Nearest neighbor queries in shared-nothing environments,Apostolos Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract In this paper; we propose an efficient solution to the problem of nearest neighborquery processing in declustered spatial databases. Recently a branch-and-bound nearestneighbor finding (BB-NNF) algorithm has been designed to process nearest neighborqueries in R-trees. However; this algorithm is strictly serial (branch-and-bound oriented) andits performance degrades; during processing of a nearest neighbor query; if applied to aparallel environment; since it does not exploit any kind of parallelization. We develop anefficient query processing strategy for parallel nearest neighbor finding (P-NNF); assuming ashared nothing multi-processor architecture; where the processors communicate via anetwork. In our method; the relevant sites are activated simultaneously. In order to achievethis goal; statistical information is used. The efficiency measure is the response time of a …,Geoinformatica,1997,15

An exact analysis on expected seeks in shadowed disks,Athena Vakali; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Shadowed disk systems store identical data. Therefore; reads are satisfied by usingthe “nearer server rule” to choose the appropriate disk; whereas writes are satisfied by alldisks. Such systems have been studied in order to derive approximate formulae for theexpected seek distances traveled for reads and writes. In the present paper; earlier analyticmodels are studied again; under a different perspective which takes into account the diskscheduling policy applied and the total number of cylinders per disk. Our analysis is exactand results in new formulae for the expected seek distances traveled for reads and writes.The deviation of the earlier formulae with respect to the new exact formulae decrements withdecreasing number of shadowed disks; increasing number of disk cylinders; as well asdecreasing ration of reads vs. writes. Thus; it is verified that earlier results could be used …,Information Processing Letters,1997,14

Functional requirements for historical and interval extensions to the relational model,Nikos A Lorentzos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract In recent years a lot of divergent approaches have been proposed for themanagement of Valid Time (Historical) data. However; no systematic effort has beenreported; concerning the identification of the properties of such a model. In the present work;it is initially shown that all proposed Valid Time (VT) models can be applied to areas ofpractical interest; not related to VT data management. All VT models are also classified withrespect to two orthogonal parameters; the way time is represented; and the level at which itis incorporated (tuple or attribute). This enables to identify that two reference VT models canbe specified; VT-1NF; a simple extension to the conventional relational model and VT-NESTED; a more general one; which supports; in addition; relation-valued attributes. Theproperties of these models are identified. Two more reference interval relational models …,Data & knowledge engineering,1995,14
Optimal data placement in two-headed disk systems,Yannis Manolopoulos; J Yannis G Kollias,Abstract A problem inherent to the performance of disk systems is the data placement incyinders in such a way that the seek time is minimized. If successive searchers areindependent; then the optimal placement for conventional one-headed disk systems is theorgan-pipe arrangement. According to this arrangement the most frequent cylinder is placedin the central location; while the less frequent cylinders are placed right and left alternatively.This paper proves that the optimal placement for two-headed disk systems is the “camel”arrangement; which may be viewed as two consecutive organ-pipe arrangements. It is alsoproved that; for a two-headed disk system with N= 2 (2 n+ 1) cylinders; the total number ofthese optimal camel arrangements is exp 2 (N/2+ 1).,BIT,1990,14
Efficient and flexible algorithms for monitoring distance-based outliers over data streams,Maria Kontaki; Anastasios Gounaris; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Kostas Tsichlas; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Anomaly detection is considered an important data mining task; aiming at thediscovery of elements (known as outliers) that show significant diversion from the expectedcase. More specifically; given a set of objects the problem is to return the suspicious objectsthat deviate significantly from the typical behavior. As in the case of clustering; theapplication of different criteria leads to different definitions for an outlier. In this work; wefocus on distance-based outliers: an object x is an outlier if there are less than k objects lyingat distance at most R from x. The problem offers significant challenges when a stream-basedenvironment is considered; where data arrive continuously and outliers must be detected on-the-fly. There are a few research works studying the problem of continuous outlier detection.However; none of these proposals meets the requirements of modern stream-based …,Information systems,2016,13
Ranking and identifying influential scientists versus mass producers by the Perfectionism Index,Antonis Sidiropoulos; Dimitrios Katsaros; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract The concept of h-index has been proposed to easily assess a researcher'sperformance with a single number. However; by using only this number; we lose significantinformation about the distribution of citations per article in an author's publication list. In thisarticle; we study an author's citation curve and we define two new areas related to this curve.We call these “penalty areas”; since the greater they are; the more an author's performanceis penalized. We exploit these areas to establish new indices; namely Perfectionism Indexand eXtreme Perfectionism Index (XPI); aiming at categorizing researchers in two distinctcategories:“influentials” and “mass producers”; the former category produces articles whichare (almost all) with high impact; and the latter category produces a lot of articles withmoderate or no impact at all.

Metric-Based Top-k Dominating Queries.,Eleftherios Tiakas; George Valkanas; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos; Dimitrios Gunopulos,ABSTRACT Top-k dominating queries combine the natural idea of selecting the k best itemswith a comprehensive “goodness” criterion based on dominance. A point p1 dominates p2 ifp1 is as good as p2 in all attributes and is strictly better in at least one. Existing worksaddress the problem in settings where data objects are multidimensional points. However;there are domains where we only have access to the distance between two objects. In caseslike these; attributes reflect distances from a set of input objects and are dynamicallygenerated as the input objects change. Consequently; prior works from the literature can notbe applied; despite the fact that the dominance relation is still meaningful and valid. For thisreason; in this work; we present the first study for processing top-k dominating queries overdistance-based dynamic asttribute vectors; defined over a metric space.

A new plane-sweep algorithm for the k-closest-pairs query,George Roumelis; Michael Vassilakopoulos; Antonio Corral; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract One of the most representative and studied Distance-Based Queries in SpatialDatabases is the K-Closest-Pairs Query (K CPQ). This query involves two spatial data setsand a distance function to measure the degree of closeness; along with a given number K ofelements of the result. The output is a set of pairs of objects (with one object element fromeach set); with the K lowest distances. In this paper; we study the problem of processing KCPQs between RAM-based point sets; using Plane-Sweep (PS) algorithms. We utilize twoimprovements that can be applied to a PS algorithm and propose a new algorithm thatminimizes the number of distance computations; in comparison to the classic PS algorithm.By extensive experimentation; using real and synthetic data sets; we highlight the mostefficient improvement and show that the new PS algorithm outperforms the classic one; in …,International Conference on Current Trends in Theory and Practice of Informatics,2014,13
Predictive join processing between regions and moving objects,Antonio Corral; Manuel Torres; Michael Vassilakopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract The family of R-trees is suitable for indexing various kinds of multidimensionalobjects. TPR*-trees are R-tree based structures that have been proposed for indexing amoving object database; eg a data-base of moving boats.

Towards quadtree-based moving objects databases,Katerina Raptopoulou; Michael Vassilakopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Nowadays; one of the main research issues of great interest is the efficient trackingof mobile objects that enables the effective answering of spatiotemporal queries. This line ofresearch is relevant to a number of modern applications spanning many contexts. In thispaper; we consider the organization of a moving object database by quadtree basedstructures (structures obeying the Embedding Space Hierarchy). In this context; we adapt anindexing method; called XBR trees; to support range queries about the history of trajectoriesof moving objects. The XBR tree is a quadtree like external memory; balanced and compactstructure that follows regular decomposition. Apart from the presentation of the new method;we experimentally show that it outperforms the only previous Embedding Space Hierarchyapproach (based on PRM quadtrees) for indexing moving objects.,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2004,13
LR-tree: a Logarithmic Decomposable Spatial Index Method.,Panayiotis Bozanis; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Numerous applications have emerged during the last few years that demand the efficientmanipulation of massive sets of geometric objects like points; lines; areas or volumes in oneor more dimensions. To name just a few; this is particularly useful in geographicalinformation systems; in CAD/VLSI design; and in mobile object movement detection andprediction. The databases that accommodate these specific kinds of objects are calledspatial and they employ data structures that must be capable of answering a very diverse setof geometric queries; like range queries that ask for all objects lying within a given region; ornearestneighbor queries that seek for the object closest to a given object; and join queriesthat search for all pairs of objects satisfying a given predicate on the set of objects that theyaccommodate.

Therefore; there is a requirementfor querying previously generated mining results or for querying the database againstdiscovered patters. In this paper; we focus on developing methods for the storage andquerying of large collections of sequential patterns. We describe a family of algorithms;which address the problem of considering the ordering among elements; that is crucial whendealing with sequential patterns. Moreover; we take into account the fact that the distributionof elements within sequential patterns is highly skewed; to propose a novel approach for theeffective encoding of patterns.

We perform an analysis withrespect to the storage requirements and a time analysis with respect to window queryoperations involving multiple features (eg to verify if a constraint defined on multiple overlaysholds or not inside a certain region). We examine both the pointer-based as well as thepointerless MOF-tree representations; using as space complexity measure the number ofbits used in main memory and the number of disk pages in secondary storage respectively.In particular; we show that the new structure is space competitive in the average case; bothin the pointer version and in the linear version; with respect to multiple instances of a …,Information Systems,1997,13

The optimum execution order of queries in linear storage,John G Kollias; Yannis Manolopoulos; Christos H Papadimitriou,Abstract Consider a file that resides in a linear storage device with one read head. Supposethat several queries on the file must be answered simultaneously with no prespecified order.To satisfy the ith query the head must be located at point L i of the file and traverse the file upto point R i without interruptions; where 1⩽ L i< R i⩽ N denote positions in the file. We wishto find the execution order that minimizes the total time to service all queries; measured asthe total distance traversed by the head. Although this is obviously a special type of travelingsalesman problem; we show that the optimum sequence can be determined by a simplealgorithm in O (n log n) time. The case in which the head may traverse a file in reverse issimilarly solved.,Information Processing Letters,1990,13

Inthis paper; we have implemented an online recommender system for LBSNs; calledGeoSocialRec; where users can get explanations along with the recommendations onfriends; locations and activities. We have conducted a user study; which shows that userstend to prefer their friends opinion more than the overall users' opinion. Moreover; in friendrecommendation; the users' favorite explanation style is the one that presents all humanchains (ie pathways of more than length 2) that connect a person with his candidate friends.,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2013,12

The goal of this paper is to extend theintegration process by the introduction of caching techniques to the client environment; inorder to decrease access time to objects distributed over various information sources. Inparticular; two methods for optimizing distributed objects exchange have been studied andimplemented the first method is based on evolutionary computation; whereas the secondone is based on the Least-Recently-Used caching algorithm. In our model; queries ask fordocuments or objects which are identified by the information source and their placement …,Proceedings International Database Conference (IDC’99),1999,12
Extended feature combination model for recommendations in location-based mobile services,Masoud Sattari; Ismail Hakki Toroslu; Pinar Karagoz; Panagiotis Symeonidis; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract With the increasing availability of location-based services; location-based socialnetworks and smart phones; standard rating schema of recommender systems that involveuser and item dimensions is extended to three-dimensional (3-D) schema involving contextinformation. Although there are models proposed for dealing with data in this form; theproblem of combining it with additional features and constructing a general model suitablefor different forms of recommendation system techniques has not been fully explored. Thiswork proposes a technique to reduce 3-D rating data into 2-D for two reasons: employingalready developed efficient methods for 2-D on a 3-D data and expanding it with additionalfeatures; which are usually 2-D also; if it is necessary. Our experiments show that thisreduction is effective. The proposed 2-D model supports content-based; collaborative …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2015,11
CLEAR: a credible method to evaluate website archivability,Vangelis Banos; Yunhyong Kim; Seamus Ross; Yannis Manolopoulos,Web archiving is crucial to ensure that cultural; scientific and social heritage on the webremains accessible and usable over time. A key aspect of the web archiving process isoptimal data extraction from target websites. This procedure is diﬃcult for such reasons as;website complexity; plethora of underlying technologies and ultimately the open-endednature of the web. The purpose of this work is to establish the notion of Website Archivability(WA) and to introduce the Credible Live Evaluation of Archive Readiness (CLEAR) methodto measure WA for any website. Website Archivability captures the core aspects of a websitecrucial in diagnosing whether it has the potentiality to be archived with completeness andaccuracy. An appreciation of the archivability of a web site should provide archivists with avaluable tool when assessing the possibilities of archiving material and in-uence web …,*,2013,11
Musical voice integration/segregation: Visa revisited,Dimitris Rafailidis; Emilios Cambouropoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,ABSTRACT The Voice Integration/Segregation Algorithm (VISA) proposed by Karydis etal.[7] splits musical scores (symbolic musical data) into different voices; based on aperceptual view of musical voice that corresponds to the notion of auditory stream. A single'voice'may consist of more than one synchronous notes that are perceived as belonging tothe same auditory stream. The algorithm was initially tested against a handful of musicalworks that were carefully selected so as to contain a steady number of streams (contrapuntalvoices or melody with accompaniment). The initial algorithm was successful on this smalldataset; but was proven to run into serious problems in cases were the number ofstreams/voices changed during the course of a musical work. A new version of the algorithmhas been developed that attempts to solve this problem; the new version; additionally …,Proceedings of the 6th Sound and Music Computing Conference,2009,11

Continuous trend-based classification of streaming time series,Maria Kontaki; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Trend analysis of time series data is an important research direction. In streamingtime series the problem is more challenging; taking into account the fact that new valuesarrive for the series; probably in very high rates. Therefore; effective and efficient methodsare required in order to classify a streaming time series based on its trend. Since new valuesare continuously arrive for each stream; the classification is performed by means of a slidingwindow which focuses on the last values of each stream. Each streaming time series istransformed to a vector by means of a Piecewise Linear Approximation (PLA) technique. ThePLA vector is a sequence of symbols denoting the trend of the series (either UP or DOWN);and it is constructed incrementally. Efficient in-memory methods are used in order to: 1)determine the class of each streaming time series and 2) determine the streaming time …,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2005,11
Performance evaluation of parallel S-trees,Eleni Tousidou; Michael Vassilakopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract The S-tree is a dynamic height-balanced tree similar in structure to B+ trees. S-treesstore fixed length bit-strings; which are called signatures. Signatures are used for indexingtextbases; relational; object oriented and extensible databases as well as in data mining. Inthis article; methods of designing multi-disk B-trees are adapted to S-trees and new methodsof parallelizing S-trees are developed. The resulting structures aim at achievingperformance gain by accessing two or more disks simultaneously. In addition; two differentsearching techniques that exploit parallel disk accessing are devised. Performance resultsof experiments based on the new structures and searching techniques are also presentedand discussed.,Journal of Database Management,2000,11

Informationarrangement on tertiary media is a crucial factor a ecting the overall system's performance.In the present paper an overview of Tertiary Storage Systems is presented and di erent dataplacement policies (adopted in secondary storage as well) are studied. The so called organ-pipe and the camel data placement schemes are applied on mid-range Tertiary tape drivemodels where the area is divided into a speci c number of xed sized partitions.

ART: sub-logarithmic decentralized range query processing with probabilistic guarantees,Spyros Sioutas; Peter Triantafillou; George Papaloukopoulos; Evangelos Sakkopoulos; Kostas Tsichlas; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract We focus on range query processing on large-scale; typically distributedinfrastructures; such as clouds of thousands of nodes of shared-datacenters; of p2pdistributed overlays; etc. In such distributed environments; efficient range query processingis the key for managing the distributed data sets per se; and for monitoring theinfrastructure's resources. We wish to develop an architecture that can support rangequeries in such large-scale decentralized environments and can scale in terms of thenumber of nodes as well as in terms of the data items stored. Of course; in the last few yearsthere have been a number of solutions (mostly from researchers in the p2p domain) fordesigning such large-scale systems. However; these are inadequate for our purposes; sinceat the envisaged scales the classic logarithmic complexity (for point queries) is still too …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2013,10
Decentralized execution of linear workflows over web services,Efthymia Tsamoura; Anastasios Gounaris; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract The development of workflow management systems (WfMSs) for the effective andefficient management of workflows in wide-area infrastructures has received a lot of attentionin recent years. Existing WfMSs provide tools that simplify the workflow composition andenactment actions; while they support the execution of complex tasks on remotecomputational resources usually through calls to web services (WSs). Nowadays; anincreasing number of WfMSs employ pipelining during the workflow execution. In this work;we focus on improving the performance of long-running workflows consisting of multiplepipelined calls to remote WSs when the execution takes place in a totally decentralizedmanner. The novelty of our algorithm lies in the fact that it considers the networkheterogeneity; and although the optimization problem becomes more complex; it is …,Future Generation Computer Systems,2011,10
EBC: a topology control algorithm for achieving high QoS in sensor networks,Alfredo Cuzzocrea; Dimitrios Katsaros; Yannis Manolopoulos; Alexis Papadimitriou,Abstract A novel approach for achieving high Quality of Service (QoS) in sensor networks viatopology control is introduced and experimentally assessed in this paper. Our approach fallsin the broader discipline of graph structural mining; and exploits a leading concept initiallystudied in the context of Social Network Analysis (SNA); namely betweenness. Particularly;in our research betweenness is applied in terms of a graph structural mining measureembedded in the core layer of our proposed topology control algorithm; called EdgeBetweenness Centrality (EBC). EBC allows us to evaluate relationships between entities ofthe network (eg; nodes; edges); and hence identify different roles among them (eg; brokers;outliers). In turn; deriving knowledge is further exploited to define raking operators that lookat structural properties of the graph modeling the target sensor network. Based on these …,International Conference on Heterogeneous Networking for Quality; Reliability; Security and Robustness,2009,10
Node and edge selectivity estimation for range queries in spatial networks,Eleftherios Tiakas; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Modern applications requiring spatial network processing pose several interestingquery optimization challenges. Spatial networks are usually represented as graphs; andtherefore; queries involving a spatial network can be executed by using the correspondinggraph representation. This means that the cost for executing a query is determined by graphproperties such as the graph order and size (ie; number of nodes and edges) and othergraph parameters. In this paper; we present novel methods to estimate the number of nodesand edges in regions of interest in spatial networks; towards predicting the space and timerequirements for range queries. The methods are evaluated by using real-life and syntheticdata sets. Experimental results show that the number of nodes and edges can be estimatedefficiently and accurately; with relatively small space requirements; thus providing useful …,Information Systems,2009,10
Collaborative filtering process in a whole new light,Panagiotis Symeonidis; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Apostolos Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Collaborative filtering (CF) systems are gaining widespread acceptance in recommendersystems and e-commerce applications. These systems combine information retrieval anddata mining techniques to provide recommendations for products; based on suggestions ofusers with similar preferences. Nearest-neighbor CF process is influenced by severalfactors; which were not examined carefully in past work. In this paper; we bring to surfacethese factors in order to identify existing false beliefs. Moreover; by being able to view the"big picture" from the CF process; we propose new approaches that substantially improve theperformance of CF algorithms. For instance; we obtain more than 40% percent increase inprecision in comparison to widely-used CF algorithms. We perform an extensiveexperimental evaluation; with several real data sets; and produce results that invalidate …,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2006.

On past-time indexing of moving objects,Katerina Raptopoulou; Michael Vassilakopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Tracking of mobile objects trajectories is one of many modern applicationssupported by Spatiotemporal databases. Within the context of this application; queries aboutthe present; future or past positions of the objects need to be answered. Several indexingmethods have been proposed to efficiently handle such spatiotemporal queries. In thecurrent paper; we propose a method for indexing the historic (past) positions of movingobjects called XBR-tree; a quadtree-like technique that is able to handle both timestamp andwindow queries. Moreover; we compare experimentally this with other methods proposed inthe literature for the same purpose. In particular; we compare XBR-trees with PMR-trees;structures also related to quadtrees and MV3R-trees; R-tree based structures.,Journal of Systems and Software,2006,10
Evaluation of similarity searching methods for music data in P2P networks,Ioannis Karydis; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,In this paper; we focus on similarity searching for similar acoustic data over unstructureddecentralised P2P networks. Similarity is measured in terms of time warping; which cancope with distortion that is naturally present when'query by content'is performed. Wepropose a novel framework; which takes advantage of the absence of overhead inunstructured P2P networks and minimises the required traffic for all operations with the useof an intelligent sampling scheme. Within the proposed framework we adapt several existingalgorithms for searching in P2P networks. Detailed experimental results show the efficiencyof the proposed framework and the comparison between similarity searching algorithms.,International Journal of Business Intelligence and Data Mining,2005,10

Cache Management for Web-Powered Databases.,Dimitrios Katsaros; Yannis Manolopoulos,ABSTRACT The Web has become the primary means for information dissemination. It isideal for publishing data residing in a variety of repositories; such as databases. In such amulti-tier system (client-Web server-underlying database); where the Web page content isdynamically derived from the database (Web-powered database); cache management isvery important in making efficient distribution of the published information. Issues related tocache management are the cache admission/replacement policy; the cache coherency andthe prefetching; which acts complementary to caching. The present chapter discusses theissues; which make the Web cache management radically different than the cachemanagement in databases or operating systems. We present a taxonomy and the mainalgorithms proposed for cache replacement and coherence maintenance. We present …,*,2003,10
On sampling regional data,Michael Vassilakopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract The region quadtree is a very popular hierarchical data structure for therepresentation of binary images (regional data) and it is heavily used at the physical level ofmany spatial databases. Random sampling algorithms obtain approximate answers ofaggregate queries on these databases efficiently. In the present report; we examine howfour different sampling methods are applied to specific quadtree implementations (to themost widely used linear implementations). In addition; we examine how two probabilisticmodels (a parametric model of random images and a model of random trees) can be usedfor analysing the cost of these methods.,Data & knowledge engineering,1997,10

B-trees with lazy parent split,Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract A B-tree variant that postpones parent node splittings due to upcoming items until alater access of the same node is examined. This technique aims to decrease the possibilityof propagating splittings to upper levels so that more concurrency is achieved. Insertion anddeletion algorithms are given. Time and space performance results are also reported andcomparison with conventional B-trees is carried out. It is shown that this techniquesubstantially improves the performance of small degree B-trees so that; indeed; concurrencyis enhanced.,Information Sciences,1994,10
Probability distributions for seek time evaluation,Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract In this work; two known probability distributions based on the replacement model;namely; the Maxwell-Boltzmann and Bose-Einstein ones; are examined. Each of thesedistributions is assigned to a specific case of query processing; which is known in theliterature as batching on primary key values or secondary key retrieval; respectively. Thesedistributions are applied in evaluating the expected distance traveled by the read/writeheads in disk searching. Two new probability distributions are derived; based on theprevious ones; which are involved in the evaluation of the expected number of the cylinderhits. Therefore; seek time evaluation is faced globally. Numerical results are given.,Information sciences,1992,10
Advanced signature indexing for multimedia and Web applications,Yannis Manolopoulos; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Eleni Tousidou,Advanced Signature Indexing for Multimedia and Web Applications presents the latestresearch developments in signature-based indexing and query processing; specifically inmultimedia and Web domains. These domains now demand a different designation ofhashing information in bit-strings (ie; signatures); and new indexes and query processingmethods.

Examples of theseapplications include: searching for similar images; representing multi-theme layers in maps;recommending products to Web-clients; and indexing large Web-log files. Special emphasisis given to structure description; implementation techniques and clear evaluation ofoperations performed (from a performance perspective). Advanced Signature Indexing for …,*,2012,9
Continuous subspace clustering in streaming time series,Maria Kontaki; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Performing data mining tasks in streaming data is considered a challengingresearch direction; due to the continuous data evolution. In this work; we focus on theproblem of clustering streaming time series; based on the sliding window paradigm. Morespecifically; we use the concept of subspace α-clusters. A subspace α-cluster consists of aset of streams; whose value difference is less than α in a consecutive number of timeinstances (dimensions). The clusters can be continuously and incrementally updated as thestreaming time series evolve with time. The proposed technique is based on a carefulexamination of pair-wise stream similarities for a subset of dimensions and then it isgeneralized for more streams per cluster. Additionally; we extend our technique in order tofind maximal pClusters in consecutive dimensions that have been used in previously …,Information Systems,2008,9
The geodesic broadcast scheme for wireless ad hoc networks,Dimitrios Katsaros; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Broadcasting is an effective means for disseminating information in wireless ad hocnetworks. I n this paper we propose a novel distributed broadcasting protocol in wireless adhoc networks; which is based on an highly eficient metric for characterizing the importanceof a node; with respect to its contribution in covering the local neighborhood. The protocol isreliable and achieves small communication complexity with linear in the number of nodescomputation complexity. Experimental results for a large variety of network topologies showthat the proposed algorithm is capable of generating small connected dominating sets;which guarantee a relatively small number of rebroadcasts.,Proceedings of the 2006 International Symposium on on World of Wireless; Mobile and Multimedia Networks,2006,9

Memory-adaptive association rules mining,Alexandros Nanopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract New application areas resulted in an increase of the diversity of the workloads thatData Base Management Systems have to confront. Resource management for mixedworkloads is attained with the prioritization of their tasks; which during their execution maybe forced to release some of their resources. In this paper; we consider workloads thatconsist of mixtures of OLTP transactions and association rule mining queries. We proposeand evaluate a new scheme for memory-adaptive association rule mining. It is designed tobe used in the case of memory fluctuations; which are due to OLTP transactions that run withhigher priority. The proposed scheme uses dynamic adjustment to the provided bufferspace. Thus; it avoids the drawbacks of simple but naive approaches; namely the thrashingdue to large disk accesses that can be caused by the direct use of virtual memory or long …,Information Systems,2004,9

A generalized comparison of linear representations of thematic layers,Yannis Manolopoulos; Enrico Nardelli; Guido Proietti; Eleni Tousidou,Abstract In this paper; the efficient encoding and manipulation of large sets of two-dimensional data that represent multiple non-overlapping features is investigated. Bothlinear structures are examined; ie; leafcode and treecode representations of thematic layers.A new technique is presented and evaluated by applying it to already proposed accessmethods that are based on the previous representations. More specifically; we experimentwith window queries that involve multiple features having as a performance measure thenumber of disk accesses. Experimentally it is shown that treecode representationsoutperform the previous structures with respect to time and space complexity.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2001,9
Estimating disk head movement in batched searching,YP Manolopoulos; John G.  Kollias,Abstract The study considers the problem of evaluating the expected disk head movementwhen the SCAN disk scheduling policy is used to answer a batch of queries. The two casesexamined are:(a) the batched queries are based on primary key values; and (b) each queryin the batch is based on secondary key values. Earlier works assumed that hit cylinders arenon-distinct and derived an exact (approximate) formula for the first (second) case. In thispaper; both replacement and non-replacement models are examined and new exact (exactand approximate) formulae are derived for the first (second) case. It is shown that earlier andnew approximate results may be used instead of the computationally expensive exactformulae.,BIT Numerical Mathematics,1988,9
New plane-sweep algorithms for distance-based join queries in spatial databases,George Roumelis; Antonio Corral; Michael Vassilakopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Efficient and effective processing of the distance-based join query (DJQ) is of greatimportance in spatial databases due to the wide area of applications that may address suchqueries (mapping; urban planning; transportation planning; resource management; etc.).The most representative and studied DJQs are the K Closest Pairs Query (K CPQ) and εDistance Join Query (ε DJQ). These spatial queries involve two spatial data sets and adistance function to measure the degree of closeness; along with a given number of pairs inthe final result (K) or a distance threshold (ε). In this paper; we propose four new plane-sweep-based algorithms for K CPQs and their extensions for ε DJQs in the context of spatialdatabases; without the use of an index for any of the two disk-resident data sets (since;building and using indexes is not always in favor of processing performance).

Enhancing SpatialHadoop with closest pair queries,Francisco García-García; Antonio Corral; Luis Iribarne; Michael Vassilakopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Given two datasets P and Q; the K Closest Pair Query (K CPQ) finds the K closestpairs of objects from P * Q. It is an operation widely adopted by many spatial and GISapplications. As a combination of the K Nearest Neighbor (K NN) and the spatial joinqueries; K CPQ is an expensive operation. Given the increasing volume of spatial data; it isdifficult to perform a K CPQ on a centralized machine efficiently. For this reason; this paperaddresses the problem of computing the K CPQ on big spatial datasets in SpatialHadoop;an extension of Hadoop that supports spatial operations efficiently; and proposes a novelalgorithm in SpatialHadoop to perform efficient parallel K CPQ on large-scale spatialdatasets. We have evaluated the performance of the algorithm in several situations with bigsynthetic and real-world datasets.

Gazing at the skyline for star scientists,Antonis Sidiropoulos; Antonia Gogoglou; Dimitrios Katsaros; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Admittedly; despite the plethora of scientometric indices proposed to rank scientists;none of them can fully capture the performance and impact of a scientist; since each indexquantifies only one or a few aspects of his/her multifarious performance. Therefore; the taskof scientometric ranking can be seen as a multi-dimensional ranking problem; where thedifferent indices comprise the dimensions. The application of the skyline operator comesthen as a natural solution to the problem. In this article we apply the skyline operator toscientist ranking to identify those scientists whose performance cannot be surpassed byothers' with respect to all attributes. This technique can be used as a tool for short-listingdistinguished researchers in case of award nomination.,Journal of Informetrics,2016,8
On the discovery of group-consistent graph substructure patterns from brain networks,Nantia D Iakovidou; Stavros I Dimitriadis; Nikolaos A Laskaris; Kostas Tsichlas; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Complex networks constitute a recurring issue in the analysis of neuroimaging data.Recently; network motifs have been identified as patterns of interconnections since theyappear in a significantly higher number than in randomized networks; in a given ensembleof anatomical or functional connectivity graphs. The current approach for detecting andenumerating motifs in brain networks requires a predetermined motif repertoire and canoperate only with motifs of small size (consisting of few nodes). There is a growing interest inmethodologies for frequent graph-based pattern mining in large graph datasets that canfacilitate adaptive design of motifs. The results presented in this paper are based on thegraph-based Substructure pattern mining (gSpan) algorithm and introduce a manifold ofways to exploit it for data-driven motif extraction in connectomics research.

Scalable link prediction in social networks based on local graph characteristics,Alexis Papadimitriou; Panagiotis Symeonidis; Yannis Manolopoulos,Online social networks (OSNs) like Face book; My space; and Hi5 have become popular;because they allow users to easily share content or expand their social circle. OSNsrecommend new friends to registered users based on local graph features (ie based on thenumber of common friends that two users share). However; OSNs do not exploit all differentlength paths of the network. Instead; they consider only pathways of maximum length 2between a user and his candidate friends. On the other hand; there are global approaches;which detect the overall path structure in a network; being computationally prohibitive forhuge-size social networks. In this paper; we provide friend recommendations; also known asthe link prediction problem; by traversing all paths of a bounded length; based on the"algorithmic small world hypothesis." As a result; we are able to provide more accurate …,Information Technology: New Generations (ITNG); 2012 Ninth International Conference on,2012,8

We propose the embedding of thespectral similarity space to a low-dimensional Euclidean space. This guarantees thetriangular inequality and allows the adoption of several indexing schemes. We enlighten theadvantages of the proposed indexable method against recently proposed spectral similaritymeasures that are also indexable. Moreover; our method compares favorably to lineardimensionality reduction methods; like multidimensional scaling (MDS). The proposedmethod significantly reduces the computation time during the construction processcompared to any audio measure and; simultaneously; minimizes the searching cost forsimilar songs.

Ranking music data by relevance and importance,Maria M Ruxanda; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Christian S Jensen; Yannis Manolopoulos,Due to the rapidly increasing availability of audio files on the Web; it is relevant to augmentsearch engines with advanced audio search functionality. In this context; the ranking of theretrieved music is an important issue. This paper proposes a music ranking method capableof flexibly fusing the music based on its relevance and importance. The fusion is controlledby a single parameter; which can be intuitively tuned by the user. The notion of authoritativemusic among relevant music is introduced; and social media mined from the Web is used inan innovative manner to determine both the relevance and importance of music. Theproposed method may support users with diverse needs when searching for music.,Multimedia and Expo; 2008 IEEE International Conference on,2008,8
Performance evaluation of lazy deletion methods in r-trees,Alexandros Nanopoulos; Michael Vassilakopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Motivated by the way R-trees are implemented in commercial databases systems;in this paper we examine several deletion techniques for R-trees. In particular; incommercial systems R-tree entries are mapped onto relational tables; which implement theirown concurrency protocols on top of existing table-level concurrency mechanisms. Inanalogy; the actual industrial implementations of B-trees do not apply the well-knownmerging procedure from textbooks in case of node underflows; but rather they apply the free-at-empty technique. This way; space is sacrificed for the benefit of faster deletions and lesslocking operations; whereas the search performance practically remains unaffected. In thiscontext; we examine the efficiency of modifications to the original R-tree deletion algorithm;which relax certain constraints of this algorithm and perform a controlled reorganization …,GeoInformatica,2003,8

Data placement schemes in replicated mirrored disk systems,Athena Vakali; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract In the present paper; we study the most frequent data placement schemes; ie; theorgan-pipe and camel arrangements; in a mirrored disk system which supports cylinderreplication at appropriate locations across the disk surface. Five schemes are proposed toidentify the appropriate replica positions for the most frequently accessed cylinders. Threeschemes; which are called Left; Right and Symmetric Replication Techniques; are based onan analytical approach. More specifically; given a single replica in the above strategies;estimates are derived for the expected seek distance decrease with respect to a non-replicated mirrored disk system. On the other hand; the remaining two schemes; which arecalled Positional and Frequency Replication Techniques; are based on heuristicapproaches.

We highlight thedifferences of the algorithms for processing single dataset queries between the xBR andxBR^+-trees and we demonstrate performance results (I/O efficiency and execution time) ofextensive experimentation (based on real and synthetic datasets) on tree building processand processing of single dataset queries; using the two structures. These results show thatthe two trees are comparable; regarding their building performance; however; the xBR^+-tree is an overall winner; regarding spatial query processing.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2015,7
Adaptive query processing in distributed settings,Anastasios Gounaris; Efthymia Tsamoura; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract In this survey chapter; we discuss adaptive query processing (AdQP) techniques fordistributed environments. We also investigate the issues involved in extending AdQPtechniques originally proposed for single-node processing so that they become applicableto multi-node environments as well. In order to make it easier for the reader to understandthe similarities among the various proposals; we adopt a common framework; whichdecomposes the adaptivity loop into the monitoring; analysis; planning and actuation (orexecution) phase. The main distributed AdQP techniques developed so far tend to differsignificantly from their centralized counterparts; both in their objectives and in their focus.The objectives in distributed AdQP are more tailored to distributed settings; whereas moreattention is paid to issues relating to the adaptivity cost; which is significant; especially …,*,2013,7
Text classification by aggregation of SVD eigenvectors,Panagiotis Symeonidis; Ivaylo Kehayov; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Text classification is a process where documents are categorized usually by topic;place; readability easiness; etc. For text classification by topic; a well-known method isSingular Value Decomposition. For text classification by readability;“Flesch Reading Easeindex” calculates the readability easiness level of a document (eg easy; medium; advanced).In this paper; we propose Singular Value Decomposition combined either with CosineSimilarity or with Aggregated Similarity Matrices to categorize documents by readabilityeasiness and by topic. We experimentally compare both methods with Flesch Reading Easeindex; and the vector-based cosine similarity method on a synthetic and a real data set(Reuters-21578). Both methods clearly outperform all other comparison partners.,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2012,7
Multiway spectral clustering link prediction in protein-protein interaction networks,Nantia Iakovidou; Panagiotis Symeonidis; Yannis Manolopoulos,An increasing number of observations support the hypothesis that the vast majority ofbiological functions involve interactions between proteins and that the complexity of livingsystems arises as a result of such interactions. In this paper we apply a multiway spectralclustering technique to protein-protein interaction networks to perform accurate linkprediction between proteins. We provide experimental evidence about the accuracy and theperformance of the proposed method in real datasets; compared to other known algorithmssuch as k-means and RWR.,Information Technology and Applications in Biomedicine (ITAB); 2010 10th IEEE International Conference on,2010,7
Graph node clustering via transitive node similarity,Eleftherios Tiakas; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,This paper studies the problem of cluster detection in undirected graphs by using transitivenode similarity methods. Well-defined semi-metric measures are proposed to compute thesimilarity between the nodes of the graph; and the clustering is based on the resultedsimilarity values. The proposed algorithm has three major steps. In the first step; which isoptional; a ranking of all the nodes of the graph is performed by using application specificcriteria (if any). In the second step; a specific node is selected and the similarity values fromthis node to all other nodes are computed and maintained into a similarity list. In the thirdstep; from the resulted similarity list values; the first cluster is constructed from the nodes thathave a sufficient similarity score. The last two steps; are repeated; until all the nodes of thegraph have been clustered. This methodology was tested in real-world data sets and …,Informatics (PCI); 2010 14th Panhellenic Conference on,2010,7

In this work we present the ART (Autonomous Range Tree) structure; whichoutperforms the most popular decentralized structures; including Chord (and some of itssuccessors); BATON (and its successor) and Skip-Graphs. ART supports the join/leave andrange query operations in O (log log N) and O (log 2 b logN+| A|) expected whp number ofhops respectively; where the base b is a double-exponentially power of two; N is the totalnumber of peers and| A| the answer size.,Proceedings of the 29th ACM SIGACT-SIGOPS symposium on Principles of distributed computing,2010,7
Grid file (and family),Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos; Yannis Theodoridis; Vassilis Tsotras,A simple definition is that gazetteers are dictionaries of placenames. The digital gazetteer asa component of georeferenced information systems; however; is more formally modeled. Agazetteer is defined as a collection of gazetteer entries; each of which contains; at aminimum; the tuple N; F; T where N is a place name; F is a formal expression of geographiclocation–a footprint; and T is a place type expressed with a term (or code) from a typingscheme. Applications often require; in addition; relationships between gazetteer entries;documentation of time frames; and additional information (as described below). Thegazetteer model is a type of knowledge organization system (KOS)–or ontology–which canbe modified to represent other classes of spatial-temporal information; such as named timeperiods and named events [3].,*,2009,7
Music retrieval over wireless ad-hoc networks,Ioannis Karydis; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Apostolos Papadopoulos; Dimitrios Katsaros; Yannis Manolopoulos,Wireless networks introduce new opportunities for music delivery. The trend of using mobiledevices on wireless networks can significantly extent the recent change of paradigm in themodel of music distribution by allowing mobile clients to search for audio music in a networkof wireless mobile hosts. This paper introduces the application of content-based musicinformation retrieval (CBMIR) in wireless ad-hoc networks. We investigate; for the first time inthe literature; the challenges posed by the wireless medium and recognize the factors thatrequire optimization. We propose novel techniques that attain a significant reduction in bothresponse time and network traffic; compared to naive approaches. Extensive experimentalresults illustrate the appropriateness; effectiveness; and efficiency of the proposed method tothis bandwidth-starving and volatility due to mobility and environment.,IEEE transactions on audio; speech; and language processing,2008,7
Indexing techniques for web access logs,Yannis Manolopoulos; Mikolaj Morzy; Tadeusz Morzy; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Marek Wojciechowski; Maciej Zakrzewicz,ABSTRACT Access histories ofusers visiting a web server are automatically recorded in webaccess logs. Conceptually; the web-log data can be regarded as a collection of clients'access-sequences; where each sequence is a list of pages accessed by a single user in asingle session. This chapterpresents novel indexing techniques that supportefficientprocessing of so-called pattern queries; which consist offinding all accesssequences that contain a given subsequence. Pattern queries are a key element ofadvanced analyses ofweb-log data; especially those concerning typical navigationschemes. In this chapter; we discuss the particularities of efficiently processing user access-sequences with pattern queries; compared to the,Web Information Systems,2004,7
Distance join queries of multiple inputs in spatial databases,Antonio Corral; Yannis Manolopoulos; Yannis Theodoridis; Michael Vassilakopoulos,Abstract Let a tuple of n objects obeying a query graph (QG) be called the n-tuple. The “Ddistance-value” of this n-tuple is the value of a linear function of distances of the n objectsthat make up this n-tuple; according to the edges of the QG. This paper addresses theproblem of finding the Kn-tuples between n spatial datasets that have the smallest Ddistance-values; the so-called K-Multi-Way Distance Join Query (K-MWDJQ); where eachset is indexed by an R-tree-based structure. This query can be viewed as an extension of K-Closest-Pairs Query (K-CPQ)[4] for n inputs. In addition; a recursive non-incremental branch-and-bound algorithm following a Depth-First search for processing synchronously all inputswithout producing any intermediate result is proposed. Enhanced pruning techniques arealso applied to the n R-trees nodes in order to reduce the total response time of the query …,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2003,7
Time split linear quadtree for indexing image databases,Theodoros Tzouramanis; Michael Vassilakopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,The time split B-tree (TSBT) is modified for indexing a database of evolving binary images.This is accomplished by embedding ideas from linear region quadtrees that make the TSBTable to support spatio-temporal query processing. To improve query performance; additionalpointers are added to the leaf-nodes of the TSBT. The resulting access method is called timesplit linear quadtree (TSLQ). Algorithms for processing five spatio-temporal queries havebeen adapted to the new structure. Such queries appear in multimedia systems; orgeographical information systems (GIS); when searched by content. The TSLQ wasimplemented and results of extensive experiments on query time performance arepresented; indicating that the proposed algorithmic approaches outbalance respectivestraightforward algorithms.

Global page replacement in spatial databases,Apostolos Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract In this paper we show how we can utilize a database buffer; when the underlyingdataspace is organized by means of a spatial data structure and particularly R-trees. In sucha case the Least Recently Used (LRU) page replacement policy is not powerful enough toguarantee efficiency; because it does not take into consideration important parameters of thestructure; such as the portion (area) of the dataspace that each page occupies. Of course;the time period passed since the last reference of a page is still an important factor.Therefore; we combine several factors; in order to derive a more powerful caching algorithm.Experiments based on real and synthetic datasets; show that the new replacement algorithmperforms better than LRU in many cases and also supports tuning.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,1996,7
On the generation of aggregated random spatial regions,Yannis Manolopoulos; Enrico Nardelli; Guido Proietti; Michael Vassilakopoulos,Abstract Traditional random models for spatial two-dimensional data proposed in literatureshow their limits in generating in a satisfactory way instances of regions having a desiredaggregation level. This is because none of them is really oriented to this aim. Rather; theyare thought to model the behaviour of the constituting elements of the spatial data (soloosing sight of the context); or; alternatively; to model particular data structure for theirrepresentation; underestimating the fact that there is in general no semantic link between aregion data and its representation. This means from one hand; the impossibility to producemeaningful the oretical results on time and space average performances of different datastructures used to represent spatial regions; and; on the other hand; in an applicativecontext; the difficulty to generate instances of spatial regions having a statistical …,Proceedings of the fourth international conference on Information and knowledge management,1995,7
Analysis of overflow handling for variable length records,Stavros Christodoulakis; Yannis Manolopoulos; P-Å Larson,Abstract Although files with variable length records are very frequent in actual databasesdue to variable length fields; missing attribute values; multiple values of an attribute andcompression; little has been reported in the literature about file structures appropriate forvariable length records. In this paper we describe and analyze several overflow handlingtechniques for the case when records are of variable length. We develop analytic modelsthat take into account variable length records and study the performance in the context ofindexed sequential (ISAM) files. We also propose a new overflow handling technique andshow that it provides an incremental reorganization capability appropriate for handlingvariable length records. Analytic results demonstrate that its performance is better than theperformance of previous methods. The overflow handling techniques and the analytic …,Information Systems,1989,7
xstreams: Recommending items to users with time-evolving preferences,Zaigham Faraz Siddiqui; Eleftherios Tiakas; Panagiotis Symeonidis; Myra Spiliopoulou; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Over the last decade a vast number of businesses have developed online e-shopsin the web. These online stores are supported by sophisticated systems that manage theproducts and record the activity of customers. There exist many research works that strive toanswer the question" what items are the customers going to like" given their historic profiles.However; most of these works miss to take into account the time dimension and cannotrespond efficiently when data are huge. In this paper; we study the problem ofrecommendations in the context of multi-relational stream mining. Our algorithm firstseparates customers based on their historic data into clusters. It then employs collaborativefiltering (CF) to recommend new items to the customers based on their clustering structure.We evaluate our algorithm on two data sets; MovieLens and a synthetic data set.,Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Web Intelligence; Mining and Semantics (WIMS14),2014,6
Content-based information retrieval in streaming music,Maria Kontaki; Ioannis Karydis; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract In this paper we examine searching by content in broadcasted streams of musicaldata; where the querier defines a set of preferred musical pieces and receives a list ofbroadcasting feeds that contain music similar to the preferred set. Streaming environmentsimpose challenging requirements for content-based music information retrieval as memorylimitations do not allow for buffering; data accumulation “on-the-fly” makes pre & postprocessing not a possibility while high response time is a necessity.

Generalized Indexing for Energy-Efficient Access to Partially Ordered Broadcast Data inWireless Networks,Dimitrios Katsaros; Nikos Dimokas; Yannis Manolopoulos,Energy conservation and access efficiency are two fundamental though competing goals inbroadcast wireless networks. To tackle the energy penalty from sequential searching; theinterleaving of index with data items has been proposed. Although; quite importantcontributions exist on providing broadcast indexes; they have one or more of the followingproblems. Firstly; all of them assume total ordering among broadcast data; and noneconsiders the more general case of partial ordering. Secondly; they are balanced structure;which does not fit the" linear (one-dimensional) structure" of the wireless medium; in whichimbalanced structures may offer significant advantages. Thirdly; they do not take intoaccount the skewness in the access pattern; which prohibits larger performance gains to bereaped. Finally; they require all index items to be of equal size; which may not always …,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2006. IDEAS'06. 10th International,2006,6
A suffix tree based prediction scheme for pervasive computing environments,Dimitrios Katsaros; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Discrete sequence modeling and prediction is a fundamental goal and a challengefor location-aware computing. Mobile client's data request forecasting and location trackingin wireless cellular networks are characteristic application areas of sequence prediction inpervasive computing; where learning of sequential data could boost the underlyingnetwork's performance. Approaches inspired from information theory comprise idealsolutions to the above problems; because several overheads in the mobile computingparadigm can be attributed to the randomness or uncertainty in a mobile client's movementor data access.

Color based image retrieval using signature trees,Mario Nascimento; Eleni Tousidou; Vishal Chitkara; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Significant research has focused on determining efficient methodologies foreffective and speedy retrieval in large image databases. Towards that goal; the firstcontribution of this paper is an image abstraction technique; called VBA; based on signaturebit-strings and a corresponding similarity metric. The signature provides a compactrepresentation of an image based on its color content and yields better retrievaleffectiveness than when using classical global color histograms (GCHs) and comparable tothe one obtained when using Color-Coherence Vectors (CCVs). More importantly however;the use of VBA signatures allows savings of 75% and 87.5% in storage overhead whencompared to GCHs and CCVs; respectively.

On the creation of quadtrees by using a branching process,Yannis Manolopoulos; Enrico Nardelli; Guido Proietti; Michael Vassilakopoulos,Abstract We present a branching process that builds region quadtrees which representrandom images obeying a general probability distribution. As an example of the usefulnessof this process we adapt it to images containing one or more sources of black colour. In suchimages; which often appear in applications; the probability that a pixel is black dependsupon its distance from one or more given centres; the sources of black. The processpresented can be used for driving a simulator for such an application: it can create and passto the simulator quadtrees obeying the above model directly; without creating the respectiverandom image first.,Image and vision computing,1996,6
A time-aware spatio-textual recommender system,Pavlos Kefalas; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) allow users to post ratings and reviewsand to notify friends of these posts. Several models have been proposed for Point-of-Interest(POI) recommendation that use explicit (ie ratings; comments) or implicit (ie statistical scores;views; and user influence) information. However the models so far fail to capture sufficientlyuser preferences as they change spatially and temporally. We argue that time is a crucialfactor because user check-in behavior might be periodic and time dependent; eg check-innear work in the mornings and check-in close to home in the evenings. In this paper; wepresent two novel unified models that provide review and POI recommendations andconsider simultaneously the spatial; textual and temporal factors. In particular; the first modelprovides review recommendations by incorporating into the same unified framework the …,Expert Systems with Applications,2017,5
Preference dynamics with multimodal user-item interactions in social media recommendation,Dimitrios Rafailidis; Pavlos Kefalas; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Recommender systems elicit the interests and preferences of individuals and makerecommendations accordingly; a main challenge for expert and intelligent systems. Anessential problem in recommender systems is to learn users' preference dynamics; that is;the constant evolution of the explicit or the implicit information; which is diversifiedthroughout time according to the user actions. Also; in real settings data sparsity degradesthe recommendation accuracy. Hence; state-of-the-art methods exploit multimodalinformation of users-item interactions to reduce sparsity; but they ignore preferencedynamics and do not capture users' most recent preferences.

Landmark selection for spectral clustering based on Weighted PageRank,Dimitrios Rafailidis; Eleni Constantinou; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Spectral clustering methods have various real-world applications; such as facerecognition; community detection; protein sequences clustering etc. Although spectralclustering methods can detect arbitrary shaped clusters; resulting thus in high clusteringaccuracy; the heavy computational cost limits their scalability. In this paper; we propose anaccelerated spectral clustering method based on landmark selection. According to theWeighted PageRank algorithm; the most important nodes of the data affinity graph areselected as landmarks. Furthermore; the selected landmarks are provided to a landmarkspectral clustering technique to achieve scalable and accurate clustering. In ourexperiments; by using two benchmark face and shape image data sets; we examine severallandmark selection strategies for scalable spectral clustering that either ignore or …,Future Generation Computer Systems,2017,5
A bi-objective cost model for database queries in a multi-cloud environment,Zisis Karampaglis; Anastasios Gounaris; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Cost models are broadly used in query processing to drive the query optimizationprocess; accurately predict the query execution time; schedule database query tasks; applyadmission control and derive resource requirements to name a few applications. The mainrole of cost models is to produce the time needed to run the query on a specific machine. Ina multi-cloud environment; this is insufficient in two aspects: firstly; the machines employedare not defined a-priori; and secondly; time estimates need to be complemented withmonetary cost information; because both the economic cost and the performance are ofprimary importance. This work addresses these two shortcomings and aims to serve as thefirst proposal for a bi-objective query cost model that is suitable for queries executed overresources provided by potentially multiple cloud providers. Moreover; our approach is …,Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Management of Emergent Digital EcoSystems,2014,5
On estimating the maximum domination value and the skyline cardinality of multi-dimensional data sets,Eleftherios Tiakas; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract The last years there is an increasing interest for query processing techniques thattake into consideration the dominance relationship between items to select the mostpromising ones; based on user preferences. Skyline and top-k dominating queries areexamples of such techniques. A skyline query computes the items that are not dominated;whereas a top-k dominating query returns the k items with the highest domination score. Toenable query optimization; it is important to estimate the expected number of skyline itemsas well as the maximum domination value of an item. In this article; the authors provide anestimation for the maximum domination value under the dinstinct values and attributeindependence assumptions. The authors provide three different methodologies forestimating and calculating the maximum domination value and the authors test their …,International Journal of Knowledge-Based Organizations (IJKBO),2013,5
Optimal service ordering in decentralized queries over web services,Efthymia Tsamoura; Anastasios Gounaris; Yannis Manolopoulos,ABSTRACT The problem of ordering expensive predicates (or filter ordering) has recentlyreceived renewed attention due to emerging computing paradigms such as processingengines for queries over remote Web Services; and cloud and grid computing. Theoptimization of pipelined plans over services differs from traditional optimization significantly;since execution takes place in parallel and thus the query response time is determined bythe slowest node in the plan; which is called the bottleneck node. Although polynomialalgorithms have been proposed for several variants of optimization problems in this setting;the fact that communication links are typically heterogeneous in wide-area environmentshas been largely overlooked. The authors propose an attempt to optimize linear orderings ofservices when the services communicate directly with each other and the communication …,*,2010,5
Building an efficient P2P overlay for energy-level queries in sensor networks,Spyros Sioutas; Konstantinos Oikonomou; George Papaloukopoulos; M Xenos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract After the debunking of some myths about why P2P overlays are not feasible insensornets; many such solutions have been proposed. None of the existing P2P overlays forsensornets provide" Energy-Level Application and Services". On this purpose and based onthe efficient P2P method presented in [16]; we design a novel P2P overlay for Energy Leveldiscovery in a sensornet; the so-called ELDT (Energy Level Distributed Tree). Sensor nodesare mapped to peers based on their energy level. As the energy levels change; the sensornodes would have to move from one peer to another and this oparation is the most crucialfor the efficient scalability of the proposed system. Similarly; as the energy level of a sensornode becomes extremelly low; that node may want to forward it's task to another node withthe desired energy level.

Efficient processing of past-future spatiotemporal queries,Katerina Raptopoulou; Michael Vassilakopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Spatiotemporal databases emerge as an evolving scientific field due to a greatvariety of applications; tracking mobile objects being one of them. For this purpose; anumber of methods have been proposed to efficiently organize and index moving objectsand answer spatiotemporal queries. The majority of all these methods are addressing eitherthe past or the future movement of the moving objects. Up until now; addressing both thepast and the future movement of the objects in an integrated manner has rarely appeared inthe literature. In the current paper; based on a spatiotemporal access method; the XBR-tree;we propose algorithms for the efficient processing of spatiotemporal window (past) andtimestamp (past; present and future) queries. Moreover; we experimentally study theefficiency of processing these queries based on the XBR-tree against using an existing …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2006,5

Fringe analysis of 2–3 trees with lazy parent split,Antigoni Manousaka; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract B-trees with lazy parent split (lps) are B-tree variants; according to which parentsplits are postponed until a future access of the latter node. This way; the number of splitsduring an insert is decreased and the number of locks is also decreased. Consequently;better concurrency is achieved. In this paper 2–3 trees with lps are studied. Fringe analysisis used to obtain bounds on some performance metrics of 2–3 trees with lps. Theperformance metrics of 2–3 tree with lps are compared with those of the classical 2–3 trees.The conclusions are that 2–3 trees with lps have slightly better performance; more keys inthe fringe; larger storage utilization and a slightly shorter path length from the root to theleaves.,The Computer Journal,2000,5

Full reversibility implies zero informationloss; thus the new method is termed Perfect Encoding. The method's analytical model isproduced and; where applicable; contrasted with the current practice in signature fileorganizations. Analysis results indicate that it comprises a potential candidacy forinformation retrieval implementations. In particular; perfect encoding has the potential todevelop into an alternative or complementary scheme to inverted or signature file basedsystems.,ADBIS,1996,5

The problem is analysed for the cases where the M requests (a) are performedindividually on a First Come First Served basis; and (b) are treated as a batch. For thesecond case a break point is established which indicates whether it is preferable to applybinary or sequential search for a batch of M keys.,The Computer Journal,1986,5

A unified framework for link and rating prediction in multi-modal social networks,Panagiotis Symeonidis; Eleftherios Tiakas; Yannis Manolopoulos,Multi-modal social networks (MSNs) allow users to form explicit (by adding new friends intheir network) or implicit (by similarly co-rating items) social networks. Previous researchwork was limited either to the prediction of new relationships among users (ie; link predictionproblem) or to the prediction of item ratings (ie; rating prediction problem and itemrecommendations). In this paper; we develop a framework to incorporate both researchdirections into a unified model. Our social-union algorithm combines similarity matricesderived from heterogeneous (unipartite and bipartite) explicit or implicit MSNs. We performan extensive experimental comparison of the proposed method against existing link andrating prediction algorithms; using synthetic and two real data sets (Epinions and Flixter).Our experimental results show that our social-union framework is more effective in both …,International Journal of Social Network Mining 5,2013,4
Query sensitive storage for wireless sensor networks,Alexis Papadimitriou; Dimitrios Katsaros; Yannis Manolopoulos,Storage management in wireless sensor networks is an area that has started to attractsignificant attention; and several methods have been proposed; such as Local Storage (LS);Data-Centric Storage (DCS) and more recently Location-Centric Storage (LCS). Severalmodern applications; like context-dependent information dissemination for pervasivecomputing; on-demand warning in surveillance sensor networks and roadway safetywarning; require that each originating event is stored around its point of origin. LCS is asuitable approach for such applications. Though; LCS does not take into consideration theorigin of the queries; which is equally important to the storage method; because it hasimmediate influence on the experienced latency.

Selectivity estimation in spatial networks,Eleftherios Tiakas; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Modern applications requiring spatial network processing pose many interestingquery optimization challenges. In many cases; query processing depends on thecorresponding graph size (number of nodes and edges) and other graph parameters. In thispaper; we present novel methods to estimate the number of nodes in regions of interest inspatial networks; towards predicting the space and time requirements of range queries. Weexamine all methods by using real-life and synthetic spatial networks. Experimental resultsshow that the number of nodes can be estimated efficiently and accurately with small spacerequirements; thus providing useful information to the query optimizer.,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2008,4
Robust Classification Based on Correlations Between Attributes1,Alexandros Nanopoulos; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos; Tatjana Welzer-Druzovec,Abstract The existence of noise in the data significantly impacts the accuracy ofclassification. In this article; we are concerned with the development of novel classificationalgorithms that can efficiently handle noise. To attain this; we recognize an analogy betweenk nearest neighbors (kNN) classification and user-based collaborative filtering algorithms; asthey both find a neighborhood of similar past data and process its contents to make aprediction about new data. The recent development of item-based collaborative filteringalgorithms; which are based on similarities between items instead of transactions;addresses the sensitivity of user-based methods against noise in recommender systems. Forthis reason; we focus on the item-based paradigm; compared to kNN algorithms; to provideimproved robustness against noise for the problem of classification. We propose two new …,International Journal of Data Warehousing and Mining,2007,4
Collaborative Filtering Based on User Trends,Panagiotis Symeonidis; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Apostolos Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Recommender systems base their operation on past user ratings over a collectionof items; for instance; books; CDs; etc. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a succesfulrecommendation technique. User ratings are not expected to be independent; as usersfollow trends of similar rating behavior. In terms of Text Mining; this is analogous to theformation of higher-level concepts from plain terms. In this paper; we propose a novel CFalgorithm which uses Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) to detect rating trends and performsrecommendations according to them. Our results indicate its superiority over existing CFalgorithms.,*,2007,4
Efficient incremental subspace clustering in data streams,Maria Kontaki; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Performing data mining tasks in streaming data is considered a challenging researchdirection; due to the continuous data evolution. In this work; we focus on the problem ofclustering streaming time series; based on the sliding window paradigm. More specifically;we use the concept of alpha-clusters in each time instance separately. A subspace alpha-cluster consists of a set of streams; whose value difference is less than a in a consecutivenumber of time instances (dimensions). The clusters can be continuously and incrementallyupdated as the streaming time series evolve. The proposed technique is based on a carefulexamination of pair-wise stream similarities for a subset of dimensions and then; it isgeneralized for more streams per cluster. Performance evaluation results show that theproposed pruning criteria are important for search space reduction; and that the cost of …,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2006.

VA-files vs. r*-trees in distance join queries,Antonio Corral; Alejandro D’Ermiliis; Yannis Manolopoulos; Michael Vassilakopoulos,Abstract In modern database applications the similarity of complex objects is examined byperforming distance-based queries (eg nearest neighbour search) on data of highdimensionality. Most multidimensional indexing methods have failed to efficiently supportthese queries in arbitrary high-dimensional datasets (due to the dimensionality curse).Similarity join queries and K closest pairs queries are the most representative distance joinqueries; where two high-dimensional datasets are combined. These queries are veryexpensive in terms of response time and I/O activity in case of high-dimensional spaces. Onthe other hand; the filtering-based approach; as applied by the VA-file; has turned out to be avery promising alternative for nearest neighbour search. In general; the filtering-basedapproach represents vectors as compact approximations; whereas by first scanning these …,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2005,4
Replication in mirrored disk systems,Athena Vakali; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract In this paper we study data replication in a mirrored disk system. Free disk space isexploited by keeping replicas of specific cylinders at appropriate disk locations. Assumingan organ-pipe arrangement we calculate the expected seek distance by varying theprobability cylinder access under different distributions. Also; analytic formulae are derivedfor the expected seek distance under replication and comparison with the conventional(without replication) mirrored disk system is performed.,East European Symposium on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,1998,4
Bulk-Loading xBR $ $^+ $ $-trees,George Roumelis; Michael Vassilakopoulos; Antonio Corral; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Spatial indexes are important in spatial databases for efficient execution of queriesinvolving spatial constraints. The xBR^+-tree is a balanced disk-resident quadtree-basedindex structure for point data; which is very efficient for processing such queries. Bulk-loading refers to the process of creating an index from scratch as a whole; when the datasetto be indexed is available beforehand; instead of creating (loading) the index gradually;when the dataset items are available one-by-one. In this paper; we present an algorithm forbulk-loading xBR^+-trees for big datasets residing on disk; using a limited amount of RAM.Moreover; using real and artificial datasets of various cardinalities; we present anexperimental comparison of this algorithm vs. the algorithm loading items one-by-one;regarding performance (I/O and execution time) and the characteristics of the xBR^+-trees …,International Conference on Model and Data Engineering,2016,3
Learning relational user profiles and recommending items as their preferences change,Zaigham Faraz Siddiqui; Eleftherios Tiakas; Panagiotis Symeonidis; Myra Spiliopoulou; Yannis Manolopoulos,Over the last decade a vast number of businesses have developed online e-shops in theweb. These online stores are supported by sophisticated systems that manage the productsand record the activity of customers. There exist many research works that strive to answerthe question “what items are the customers going to like” given their historical profiles.However; most of these works do not take into account the time dimension and cannotrespond efficiently when data are huge. In this paper; we study the problem ofrecommendations in the context of multi-relational stream mining. Our algorithm “xStreams”first separates customers based on their historical data into clusters. It then employscollaborative filtering (CF) to recommend new items to the customers based on their groupsimilarity.

Introduction,Yannis Manolopoulos; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Theodoridis,Abstract The paper entitled “The ubiquitous B-tree” by Comer was published in ACMComputing Surveys in 1979 [49]. Actually; the keyword “B-tree” was standing as a genericterm for a whole family of variations; namely the B*-tree; the B+-tree and several othervariants [111]. The title of the paper might have seemed provocative at that time. However; itrepresented a big truth; which is still valid now; because all textbooks on databases or datastructures devote a considerable number of pages to explain definitions; characteristics; andbasic procedures for searches; inserts; and deletes on B-trees. Moreover; B+-trees are notjust a theoretical notion. On the contrary; for years they have been the de facto standardaccess method in all prototype and commercial relational systems for typical transactionprocessing applications; although one could observe that some quite more elegant and …,*,2006,3

Incremental nearest-neighbor search in moving objects,Katerina Raptopoulou; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,In databases of moving objects it is important to answer queries that concern the futurepositions of the objects. An important query type in such an environment is the nearest-neighbor query; which asks for the k closest objects of a query object during a time interval[t/sub s/; t/sub e/]. However; there are cases where the (k+ 1)-th nearest-neighbor isrequested after the execution of the k-NN query. In such a case; either the query must beevaluated again; or we can exploit the previous result and use an incremental method todetermine the new answer. We focus on the second alternative and present efficientincremental algorithms that outperform the trivial method which is based on complete re-execution of the query. In addition; we study the problem of keeping the query resultconsistent in the presence of object insertions; deletions and updates which are very …,Pervasive Services; 2005. ICPS'05. Proceedings.

Similarity Search in Time Series Databases,Maria Kontaki; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract In many application domains; data can be represented as a series of values (timeseries). Examples include stocks; seismic signals; audio; and many more. Similarity searchin time series databases is an important research direction. Several methods have beenproposed in order to provide algorithms for efficient query processing in the case of statictime series of fixed length. Research in this field has focused on the development of effectivetransformation techniques; the application of dimensionality reduction methods; and thedesign of efficient indexing schemes. These tools enable the process of similarity queries intime series databases. In the case where time series are continuously updated with newvalues (streaming time series); the similarity problem becomes even more difficult to solve;since we must take into consideration the new values of the series.

A performance comparison of quadtree-based access methods for thematic maps,Eleni Tousidou; Yannis Manolopoulos,ABSTRACT In this paper; the efficient manipulation of thematic maps that contain multiplenon-overlapping features is investigated. New methods based on Linear quadtrees areproposed and their performance is compared to that of similar structures. More specifically;window queries involving multiple features are described and tested having the number ofdisk accesses as a performance measure. Experimentally; it is shown that the proposedmethods have a stable behavior and; in general; outperform the previous structures withrespect to time and space complexity.,Proceedings of the 2000 ACM symposium on Applied computing-Volume 1,2000,3

Binary ranking for the signature file method,Dimitrios Dervos; P Linardis; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract A new method for ranking the output of the superimposed variation of the signaturefile method (SC/SF) is presented. The method is termed 'Binary Ranking'and assigns a value('B-rank value') to each block candidacy of the signature file output in a way which reflectsthe credibility of the signature to stand in place of the corresponding real text. In order tomeasure the performance of the proposed technique; a simulation environment based on aRelational Database Management System is established. Binary Ranking is found to bepromising for a category of real-life applications and allows for future enhancements.,Information and Software Technology,1994,3

Algorithms for a hashed file with variable-length records,Yannis Manolopoulos; N Fistas,Abstract Variable-length records are very frequent in database environments. This workgives a set of algorithms for maintaining a new model of static hashed files designed toaccommodate variable-length records. Two special techniques for variable-length recordsare used. First; records are ordered by length and not by key value; eg; the shortest (longest)records are stored in the main (overflow) blocks. Second; at the cost of a small directory forthe overflow records stored in the main file blocks; the successful and unsuccessfulsearches are faster. The directory consists of the triplet key value; record length; and pointerto the overflow block. In addition; this work reports a simulation of the file structure.Numerical results show the benefits of the model. These two techniques may be applied inany primary key file organization that uses overflow chaining; including the recent …,Information sciences,1992,3
Efficient expressions for completely and partly unsuccessful batched search of tree-structured files,Sheau-Dong Lang; Yannis Manolopoulos,Closed-form; nonrecurrent expressions for the cost of completely and partly unsuccessfulbatched searching are developed for complete j-ary tree files. These expressions areapplied to both the replacement and nonreplacement models of the search queries. Theexpressions provide more efficient formulas than previously reported for calculating the costof batched searching. The expressions can also be used to estimate the number of blockaccesses for hierarchical file structures.,IEEE transactions on software engineering,1990,3
Expressions for completely and partly unsuccessful batched search of sequential and tree-structured files,Yannis Manolopoulos; John G.  Kollias,A number of previous studies derived expressions for batched searching of sequential andtree-structured files on the assumption that all the keys in the batch exist in the file; ie; all thesearches are successful. Formulas for batched searching of sequential and tree-structuredfiles are derived; but the assumption made is that either all or part of the keys in the batch donot exist in the file; ie; the batched search is completely or partly unsuccessful.,IEEE transactions on software engineering,1989,3
An efficient algorithm for bulk-loading xBR+-trees,George Roumelis; Michael Vassilakopoulos; Antonio Corral; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract A major part of the interface to a database is made up of the queries that can beaddressed to this database and answered (processed) in an efficient way; contributing to thequality of the developed software. Efficiently processed spatial queries constitute afundamental part of the interface to spatial databases due to the wide area of applicationsthat may address such queries; like geographical information systems (GIS); location-basedservices; computer visualization; automated mapping; facilities management; etc. Anotherimportant capability of the interface to a spatial database is to offer the creation of efficientindex structures to speed up spatial query processing.

Bibliometric indices for the assessment of the citation curve tail,Antonia Gogoglou; Antonis Sidiropoulos; Dimitrios Katsaros; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Scientometrics is an area recently attracting greater research interest. To a greatextent this area has been fertilized by the proposal of the h-index (2005); which represents ameasure for the quality and quantity of a researcher's impact. The Perfectionism Index hasbeen recently proposed aiming at differentiating between'influentials' and'massproducers'(2015); the former category produces articles; which are (almost all) with highimpact; whereas the latter category produces a lot of articles with moderate or no impact atall. In this paper; we record a number of metrics that are of similar nature; ie they shed lightinto these publishing patterns (influentials vs. mass producers). We carry out a correlationanalysis to reveal which metrics are describing the above phenomenon in a similar way and;thus; retain the most descriptive features.

A bi-objective cost model for optimizing database queries in a multi-cloud environment,Anastasios Gounaris; Zisis Karampaglis; Athanasios Naskos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Cost models are broadly used in query processing to drive the query optimizationprocess; accurately predict the query execution time; schedule database query tasks; applyadmission control and derive resource requirements to name a few applications. The mainrole of cost models is to estimate the time needed to run the query on a specific machine. Ina multi-cloud environment; cost models should be easily calibrated for a wide range ofdifferent physical machines; and time estimates need to be complemented with monetarycost information; since both the economic cost and the performance are of primaryimportance.

Parallel data paths in two-headed disk systems,Athena Vakali; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Analytic models on the expected seek distances for a set of k shadowedconventional disks with one read/write head per surface have been reported in the past. Inthe present paper we study the expected seek performance in the case of parallel diskshaving two heads per surface. Two-headed disks may have either two autonomous headsper surface or may have two heads moving concurrently at a fixed distance. Theperformance of both models is examined by assuming that successive seeks are eitherindependent or dependent. Exact new formulae are derived for each of the aforementionedcases and generalized performance comparisons of all these disk configurations are made.,Information and Software Technology,1997,2

Batched search iscompared with the simple on-line search and a proposal is stated concerning thereorganization of index sequential files.,Information processing letters,1986,2
A symbolic dynamics approach to Epileptic Chronnectomics: Employing strings to predict crisis onset,Nantia D Iakovidou; Nikos A Laskaris; Costas Tsichlas; Yannis Manolopoulos; Manolis Christodoulakis; Eleftherios S Papathanasiou; Savvas S Papacostas; Georgios D Mitsis,Abstract Treating brain as a complex system is currently among the most popularapproaches that are used to understand its function and explain encephalopathies. Thenetworked epileptic brain has already been studied through various neuroimagingmodalities based on estimates of functional connectivity. Here; we suggest that additionalinsights to epileptogenesis can be gained with an appropriate description on the network(re) organization dynamics as these are reflected in surface EEG measurements. Ourapproach commences with a pattern analytic step that turns a time series of connectivitypatterns into a symbolic time series. The condensed dynamics are then analyzed by meansof Markov chain modeling and a motif detection algorithm.

A Rainbow at the Skyline after the Storm of Indicators for Ranking Scientists,Georgios Stoupas; Antonis Sidiropoulos; Antonia Gogoglou; Dimitrios Katsaros; Yannis Manolopoulos,A plethora of bibliometric indices have been proposed to quantify scientific output. To dealwith this storm of valuable indicators; the need arises for a classification scheme of scientistsaccording to multiple evaluation metrics. In this work; we expand upon the concept of theskyline operator (Sidiropoulos; Gogoglou; Katsaros; & Manolopoulos; 2016); and introducea new indicator; namely the Rainbow Ranking. For this study; we collected data fromMicrosoft Academic Search (MAS); and extracted full citation data starting from year 1950 upto 2015 for computer science scientists.,*,2017,1
Recommendations based on a heterogeneous spatio-temporal social network,Pavlos Kefalas; Panagiotis Symeonidis; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Recommender systems in location-based social networks (LBSNs); such asFacebook Places and Foursquare; have focused on recommending friends or locations toregistered users by combining information derived from explicit (ie friendship network) andimplicit (ie user-item rating network; user-location network; etc.) sub-networks. However;previous models were static and failed to adequately capture user time-varying preferences.In this paper; we provide a novel recommendation method based on the time dimension aswell. We construct a hybrid tripartite (ie; user; location; session) graph; which incorporates 7different unipartite and bipartite graphs. Then; we test it with an extended version of theRandom Walk with Restart (RWR) algorithm; which randomly walks through the network byusing paths of 7 differently weighted edge types (ie; user-location; user-session; user …,World Wide Web,2017,1
Incorporating change detection in the monitoring phase of adaptive query processing,Efthymia Tsamoura; Anastasios Gounaris; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Recent Big Data research typically emphasizes on the need to address thechallenges stemming from the volume; velocity; variety and veracity aspects. However;another cross-cutting property of Big Data is volatility. In database technology; volatility isaddressed with the help of adaptive query processing (AQP); which has become thedominant paradigm for executing queries in dynamic and/or streaming environments. As thecharacteristics of the runtime environment may vary significantly along time; AQP techniquesemploy a three-phase adaptivity loop to process the input queries; comprising feedbackcollection; analysis and re-optimization. In the monitoring phase; the standard approach is tocollect feedback in a fixed-size sliding window. However; several problems arise when thetechniques adopt a fixed-size sliding window for maintaining runtime collected feedback …,Journal of Internet Services and Applications,2016,1

Processing top-k dominating queries in metric spaces,Eleftherios Tiakas; George Valkanas; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Top-k dominating queries combine the natural idea of selecting the k best itemswith a comprehensive “goodness” criterion based on dominance. A point p 1 dominates p 2if p 1 is as good as p 2 in all attributes and is strictly better in at least one. Existing worksaddress the problem in settings where data objects are multidimensional points. However;there are domains where we only have access to the distance between two objects. In caseslike these; attributes reflect distances from a set of input objects and are dynamicallygenerated as the input objects change. Consequently; prior works from the literature cannotbe applied; despite the fact that the dominance relation is still meaningful and valid. For thisreason; in this work; we present the first study for processing top-k dominating queries overdistance-based dynamic attribute vectors; defined over a metric space. We propose four …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2016,1

Scalable Spectral Clustering with Weighted PageRank,Dimitrios Rafailidis; Eleni Constantinou; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract In this paper; we propose an accelerated spectral clustering method; using alandmark selection strategy. According to the weighted PageRank algorithm; the mostimportant nodes of the data affinity graph are selected as landmarks. The selectedlandmarks are provided to a landmark spectral clustering technique to achieve scalable andaccurate clustering. In our experiments with two benchmark face and shape image data sets;we examine several landmark selection strategies for scalable spectral clustering that eitherignore or consider the topological properties of the data in the affinity graph. Finally; weshow that the proposed method outperforms baseline and accelerated spectral clusteringmethods; in terms of computational cost and clustering accuracy; respectively.,International Conference on Model and Data Engineering,2014,1

Optimization of decentralized multi-way join queries over pipelined filtering services,Efthymia Tsamoura; Anastasios Gounaris; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract The capability to optimize and execute complex queries over multiple remoteservices (eg; web services) is of high significance for efficient data management in largescale distributed computing infrastructures; such as those enabled by grid and cloudcomputing technology. In this work; we investigate the optimization of queries that involvemultiple data resources; each of which is processed by non-overlapping sets of remotefiltering services. The main novelty of this work is the proposal of optimization algorithms thatproduce an ordering of calls to services so that the query response time is minimized. Thedistinctive features of our work lie in the consideration of direct; heterogenous links amongservices and of multiple data resources.

Building Tag-Aware Groups for Music High-Order Ranking and Topic Discovery,Dimitrios Rafailidis; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,ABSTRACT In popular music information retrieval systems; users have the opportunity to tagmusical objects to express their personal preferences; thus providing valuable insightsabout the formulation of user groups/communities. In this article; the authors focus on theanalysis of social tagging data to reveal coherent groups characterized by their users; tagsand music objects (eg; songs and artists); which allows for the expression of discoveredgroups in a multi-aspect way. For each group; this study reveals the most prominent users;tags; and music objects using a generalization of the popular web-ranking concept in thesocial data domain. Experimenting with real data; the authors' results show that each Tag-Aware group corresponds to a specific music topic; and additionally; a three way rankinganalysis is performed inside each group.

Estimation of the maximum domination value in multi-dimensional data sets,Eleftherios Tiakas; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract The last years there is an increasing interest for query processing techniques thattake into consideration the dominance relationship between objects to select the mostpromising ones; based on user preferences. Skyline and top-k dominating queries areexamples of such techniques. A skyline query computes the objects that are not dominated;whereas a top-k dominating query returns the k objects with the highest domination score.To enable query optimization; it is important to estimate the expected number of skylineobjects as well as the maximum domination value of an object. In this paper; we provide anestimation for the maximum domination value for data sets with statistical independencebetween their attributes. We provide three different methodologies for estimating andcalculating the maximum domination value; and we test their performance and accuracy …,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2010,1
Primary index,Yannis Manolopoulos; Yannis Theodoridis; Vassilis J Tsotras,P/FDM [5–7] integrated a functional data model with the logic programming language Prologfor general-purpose computation. The data model can be seen as an Entity-Relationshipdiagram with sub-types; much like a UML Class Diagram. The idea was for the user to beable to define a computation over objects in the diagram; instead of just using it as a schemadesign aid. Later versions of P/FDM included a graphic interface [2; 4] to build queries inDAPLEX syntax by clicking on the diagram and filling in values from menus.,*,2009,1

For example; a language model based on a big English newspaper archive isexpected to assign a higher probability to ''a bit of text''than to ''aw pit tov tags;''because thewords in the former phrase (or word pairs or word triples if so-called N-Gram Models areused) occur more frequently in the data than the words in the latter phrase. For informationretrieval; typical usage is to build a language model for each document. At search time; thetop ranked document is the one whose language model assigns the highest probability tothe query.,*,2009,1
Spatial indexing techniques,Yannis Manolopoulos; Yannis Theodoridis; Vassilis J Tsotras,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,*,2009,1
Similarity search in time series,Maria Kontaki; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract In many application domains; data are represented as a series of values in differenttime instances (time series). Examples include stocks; seismic signals; audio; and so forth.Similarity search in time series databases is an important research direction. Severalmethods have been proposed to provide efficient query processing in the case of static timeseries of fixed length. Research in this field has focused on the development of effectivetransformation techniques; the application of dimensionality reduction methods; and thedesign of efficient indexing schemes. These tools enable the process of similarity queries intime series databases. In the case where time series are continuously updated with newvalues (streaming time series); the similarity problem becomes even more difficult to solve;since we must take into consideration the new values of the series.

Item-based Classification for Robustness Against Noise,Alexandros Nanopoulos; Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Tatjana Welzer-Druzovec; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract. The existence of noise in the data significantly impacts the accuracy ofclassification. In this paper; we are concerned with the development of novel classificationalgorithms that can efficiently handle noise. To attain this; we recognize an analogy betweenk nearest neighbors (kNN) classification and user-based collaborative filtering algorithms; asthey both find a neighborhood of similar past data and process its contents to make aprediction about new data. The recent development of item-based collaborative filteringalgorithms; which are based on similarities between items instead of transactions;addresses the sensitivity of user-based methods against noise in recommender systems. Forthis reason we focus on the item-based paradigm to provide improved robustness;compared to kNN algorithms; against noise for the problem of classification. We propose …,Proc.

Closest pair queries with spatial constraints,Apostolos N Papadopoulos; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Given two datasets D_A and D_B the closest-pair query (CPQ) retrieves the pair (a;b); where aϵD_A and bϵD_B; having the smallest distance between all pairs of objects. Anextension to this problem is to generate the k closest pairs of objects (k-CPQ). In severalcases spatial constraints are applied; and object pairs that are retrieved must also satisfythese constraints. Although the application of spatial constraints seems natural towards amore focused search; only recently they have been studied for the CPQ problem with therestriction that D_A= D_B. In this work we focus on constrained closest-pair queries (CCPQ);between two distinct datasets D_A and D_B; where objects from D_A must be enclosed by aspatial region R.

On the number of recursive calls of recursive functions,Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract The advantages and disadvantages of recursion are early introduced to students.Simplicity in coding but time and space inefficiency during execution are the maincharacteristics. In many occasions; recursive formulae lead to recursivefunctions/procedures that are highly inefficient as calls with the same parameters areexecuted several times. Here; we elaborate on a previous report [2]; where a generalizedanalysis is carried out to derive the number of recursive calls of a recursive formula; thecalculation of the Fibonacci numbers in particular. Here we re-examine the problem using adifferent and simpler approach; which generalizes as well.,ACM SIGCSE Bulletin,2005,1

File organizations with shared overflow blocks for variable length objects,Yannis Manolopoulos; Stavros Christodoulakis,Abstract Traditional file organizations for records may also be appropriate for the storageand retrieval of objects. Since objects frequently involve diverse data types (such as text;compressed images; graphics; etc.) as well as composite structures; they may have a largelyvariable length. In this paper; we assume that in the case of composite objects theircomponents are clustered together and that object file organizations have overflows. Theblocks of the main file are grouped so that they share a common number of overflow blocks.For this class of file organizations we present and analyze the performance of three differentoverflow searching algorithms. We show that the third algorithm gives very significantperformance advantages under certain circumstances.,Information Systems,1992,1

Bulk Insertions into xBR-trees,Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract. Bulk insertion refers to the process of updating an existing index by inserting alarge batch of new data; treating the items of this batch as a whole and not by inserting theseitems one-by-one. Bulk insertion is related to bulk loading; which refers to the process ofcreating a non-existing index from scratch; when the dataset to be indexed is availablebeforehand.

Processing skyline queries in temporal databases,Christos Kalyvas; Theodoros Tzouramanis; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract The skyline query aims to filter out a set of eligible points on the basis of a set ofevaluation criteria and out of a potentially large dataset of points. The computation of thisdecision support problem has been studied across a wide range of environments and oftypes of data. A field of research that has remained unexplored in the context of this problem;and which would also greatly benefit from the study of the computation of the skyline query;is that of temporal databases. A solution for computing skyline queries and some of itsvariants over temporal data is put forward here.

Use-based Optimization of Spatial Access Methods,Nikolaos Athanasiou; Michael Vassilakopoulos; Antonio Corral; Yannis Manolopoulos,ABSTRACT Spatial access methods have been extensively studied in the literature; duringlast decades. Access methods were designed for efficient processing of demanding queriesand extensive comparisons between such methods have been presented. However;choosing the best values for the parameters that affect the performance of a spatial accessmethod when such a method is expected to be utilized within a specific workload/context ofoperations has not been studied; so far.

Efficient large-scale distance-based join queries in spatialhadoop,Francisco García-García; Antonio Corral; Luis Iribarne; Michael Vassilakopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Efficient processing of Distance-Based Join Queries (DBJQs) in spatial databasesis of paramount importance in many application domains. The most representative andknown DBJQs are the K Closest Pairs Query (KCPQ) and the ε Distance Join Query (εDJQ).These types of join queries are characterized by a number of desired pairs (K) or a distancethreshold (ε) between the components of the pairs in the final result; over two spatialdatasets. Both are expensive operations; since two spatial datasets are combined withadditional constraints. Given the increasing volume of spatial data originating from multiplesources and stored in distributed servers; it is not always efficient to perform DBJQ s on acentralized server. For this reason; this paper addresses the problem of computing DBJQson big spatial datasets in SpatialHadoop; an extension of Hadoop that supports efficient …,GeoInformatica,2017,*
Early malicious activity discovery in microblogs by social bridges detection,Antonia Gogoglou; Zenonas Theodosiou; Tasos Kounoudes; Athena Vakali; Yannis Manolopoulos,With the emerging and intense use of Online Social Networks (OSNs) amongst youngchildren and teenagers (youngsters); safe networking and socializing on the Web has facedextensive scrutiny. Content and interactions which are considered safe for adult OSN usersmight embed potentially threatening and malicious information when it comes to underageusers. This work is motivated by the strong need to safeguard youngsters OSNs experiencesuch that they can be empowered and aware.

Enhancing SpatialHadoop with Closest Pair Queries,Michael Vassilakopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract. Given two datasets P and Q; the K Closest Pair Query (KCPQ) finds the K closestpairs of objects from P× Q. It is an operation widely adopted by many spatial and GISapplications. As a combination of the K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and the spatial join queries;KCPQ is an expensive operation. Given the increasing volume of spatial data; it is difficult toperform a KCPQ on a centralized machine efficiently. For this reason; this paper addressesthe problem of computing the KCPQ on big spatial datasets in SpatialHadoop; an extensionof Hadoop that supports spatial operations efficiently; and proposes a novel algorithm inSpatialHadoop to perform efficient parallel KCPQ on large-scale spatial datasets. We haveevaluated the performance of the algorithm in several situations with big synthetic and real-world datasets.

The K Group Nearest-Neighbor Query on Non-indexed RAM-Resident Data,George Roumelis; Michael Vassilakopoulos; Antonio Corral; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Data sets that are used for answering a single query only once (or just a few times)before they are replaced by new data sets appear frequently in practical applications. Thecost of buiding indexes to accelerate query processing would not be repaid for such datasets. We consider an extension of the popular (K) Nearest-Neighbor Query; called the (K)Group Nearest Neighbor Query (GNNQ). This query discovers the (K) nearest neighbor (s) toa group of query points (considering the sum of distances to all the members of the querygroup) and has been studied during recent years; considering data sets indexed by efficientspatial data structures.

The xBR+-tree: An Efficient Access Method for Points,Antonio Corral; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract. Spatial indexes; such as those based on Quadtree; are important in spatialdatabases for efficient execution of queries involving spatial constraints. In this paper; wepresent improvements of the xBR-tree (a member of the Quadtree family) with modifiedinternal node structure and tree building process; called xBR+-tree. We highlight thedifferences of the algorithms for processing single dataset queries between the xBR andxBR+-trees and we demonstrate performance results (I/O efficiency and execution time) ofextensive experimentation (based on real and synthetic datasets) on tree building processand processing of single dataset queries; using the two structures. These results show thatthe two trees are comparable; regarding their building performance; however; the xBR+-treeis an overall winner; regarding spatial query processing.,Database and Expert Systems Applications: 26th International Conference; DEXA 2015; Valencia; Spain; September 1-4; 2015; Proceedings,2015,*

Similarity Range Queries in Streaming Time Series.,Maria Kontaki; Apostolos Papadopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract. Similarity search in time series databases is an important research direction.Several methods have been proposed in order to provide algorithms for efficient queryprocessing in the case of static time series of fixed length. In streaming time series thesimilarity problem is more complex; since the dynamic nature of streaming data make thesemethods inappropriate. In this paper; we propose a new method to evaluate similarity rangequeries in streaming time series. The method is based on the use of a multidimensionalaccess method; the R*-tree; which is used to store features of the time series extracted bymeans of the DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform). We take advantage of the incrementalcomputation of the DFT and equip the R*-tree with a deferred update policy in order toimprove maintenance costs.

Compressing large signature trees,Maria Kontaki; Yannis Manolopoulos; Alexandros Nanopoulos,Abstract In this paper we present a new compression scheme for signature tree structures.Beyond the reduction of storage space; compression attains significant savings in terms ofquery processing. The latter issue is of critical importance when considering largecollections of set valued data; eg; in object-relational databases; where signature treestructures find important applications. The proposed scheme works on a per node basis; byreorganizing node entries according to their similarity; which results to sparse bit vectors thatcan be drastically compressed. Experimental results illustrate the efficiency gains due to theproposed scheme; especially for interesting real-world cases; like basket-market data orWeb-server logs.,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2003,*

Generating Dynamic Raster Data,Theodoros Tzouramanis; Michael Vassilakopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract Benchmarking of spatio-temporal databases is an issue of growing importance. Incase large real data sets are not available; benchmarking requires the generation of artificialdata sets following the realworld behavior of spatial objects that change their locations;shapes and sizes over time. In this report; a generator for changing raster data; called“Generator of Time-Evolving Regional Data”(G-TERD); is presented. The basic concepts thatdetermine the function of G-TERD are the structure of complex two-dimensional rasterobjects; their color; maximum speed; zoom and rotation-angle per time slot; the influence ofother moving or static objects on the speed and on the moving direction of an object; theposition and movement of the scene-observer; the statistical distribution of each changingfactor and finally; time. In the framework developed; the user can control the generator …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2003,*
Introduction to the special section on spatiotemporal databases,Yannis Manolopoulos,Modern applications are both data and computationally intensive and require the storageand manipulation of voluminous traditional (alphanumeric) and non-traditional data sets(images; text; geometric objects; time-series). Examples of such emerging applicationdomains are: geographical information systems (GIS); multimedia information systems;CAD/CAM applications; time-series analysis; medical information systems; on-line analyticalprocessing (OLAP) and data mining. These applications pose diverse requirements withrespect to the information and the operations that need to be supported; and therefore fromthe database perspective; new data models; techniques and tools need to be developedtowards increased adequate representation of the data and efficient query processing. Aspatial database system is enhanced by special tools in order to handle queries that refer …,The Computer Journal,2003,*

Caching across heterogeneous information sources: an object-based approach,Athena Vakali; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract: Information exchange has been increased drastically and rapidly due to the majorlarge scale Internet expansion. The structure of information sources worldwide has beenaltered and both structured and semistructured data are stored in various heterogeneousinformation spaces. Several tools have been developed for facilitating the rapid integrationof the different information structures and accessing needs across heterogeneous sourcesover the Internet. This paper proposes a caching approach to extend the heterogeneousinformation sources integration process such that distributed objects are better accessedand retrieved. Our caching approach considers objects that are formed in response tocertain queries posed over a specified number of distinct information sources. Amethodology based on the notion of genetic algorithms is studied aiming at facilitating …,Information processing and technology,2001,*
Processing of Joins between R-trees and Linear Region Quadtrees,Michael Vassilakopoulos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract The family of R-trees is suitable for storing various kinds of multidimensional objectsand is considered an excellent choice for indexing a spatial database. Region Quadtreesare suitable for storing 2-dimensional regional data and their linear variant is used in manyGeographical Information Systems for this purpose. In this report; we present an algorithmsuitable for processing of join queries between these two successful; although very di erent;data structures. This algorithm is based on heuristics that aim at minimizing the I/O cost.,*,1998,*
The impact of seeking in partial match retrieval,Athena Vakali; Yannis Manolopoulos,The authors extend the problem of partial match query satisfaction by studying the impact ofseeking. They study the physical location of the output pages by considering the numberand the sparseness of cylinders holding the resulting pages. Lower and upper seek timebounds; as well as the average behavior of the seek time are calculated by assuming somereal figures of specific modern disk system devices. The main conclusion is that the seektime is a factor affecting the partial match query response time and needs to be included inthe overall performance measurement.,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 1996.

Partial match retrieval in two-headed disks,Yannis Manolopoulos; Athena Vakali,Abstract The performance of a disk with two heads per surface separated by a fixed numberof cylinders is examined. We derive the probability distribution of arm stops; the expectednumber of stops as well as the expected number of cylinder clusters; ie the number of sets ofconsecutive compound cylinders. In comparison with a single-headed disk; it is shown thatthe performance gain may reach 50% on the average.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,1995,*
Functional requirements for historical and interval extensions,Nikos A Lorentzos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract In recent years a lot of divergent approaches have been proposed for themanagement of Valid Time (Historical) data. However; no systematic effort has beenreported; concerning the identification of the properties of such a model. In the present work;it is initially shown that all proposed Valid Time (VT) models can be applied to areas ofpractical interest; not related to VT data management. All VT models are also classified withrespect to two Orthogonal parameters; the way time is represented; and the level at which itis incorporated (tuple or attribute). This enables to identify that two reference VT models canbe specified; VT-1NF; a simple extension to the conventional relational model and VT-NESTED; a more general one; which supports; in addition; relation-valued attributes. Theproperties of these models are identified. Two more reference interval relational models …,*,1995,*
Ranking the validity of block candidacies in signature files,Dimitrios Dervos; Yannis Manolopoulos; P Linardis,Abstract A variation of the superimposed coding version of the signature file method isintroduced. The processing of a user query is similar to that of the conventional method withone difference: the output is provided in a ordered (ranked) way. The latter is based on acredibility value reflecting the probability of each candidate block to pass the validation testrather than being a false drop. The principles; an analytical model; and simulation results ofthe new technique are presented. The model's usefulness is the reduced I/O activity forcases where the user is only sampling the text base and is satisfied by retrieving a limitednumber of the many documents that qualify.,Information sciences,1994,*

An advanced system for automated certification,Ioannis Samoladas; Alexandros Nanopoulos; Athanasis Karoulis; Ioannis Stamelos; Yannis Manolopoulos,Abstract: Internet has revolutionized many aspects of our everyday life. Education could notstay intact; Internet has introduced the great ability of distance learning; which allows thetraditional educational process to overcome several limitations. Among the requirementsthat accrue naturally; is the assessment of the results for the new type of educationalprocess. This requirement is denoted as distance certification. While numerousorganizations have emerged to support the certification process; the presence of systemsthat will automate this process and will render it clear and objective; is limited. In this paper;we first describe the requirements that have to be addressed for the development of such asystem. For a better understanding of the requirements we modelled the certification processand simulate it. The certification model was built according to the most recent standards …,*,*,*
