Research issues in web data mining,Sanjay Kumar Madria; Sourav S Bhowmick; W-K Ng; Ee-Peng Lim,Abstract In this paper; we discuss mining with respect to web data referred here as web datamining. In particular; our focus is on web data mining research in context of our webwarehousing project called WHOWEDA (Warehouse of Web Data). We have categorizedweb data mining into threes areas; web content mining; web structure mining and webusage mining. We have highlighted and discussed various research issues involved in eachof these web data mining category. We believe that web data mining will be the topic ofexploratory research in near future.,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,1999,364
A survey of web metrics,Devanshu Dhyani; Wee Keong Ng; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract The unabated growth and increasing significance of the World Wide Web hasresulted in a flurry of research activity to improve its capacity for serving information moreeffectively. But at the heart of these efforts lie implicit assumptions about" quality" and"usefulness" of Web resources and services. This observation points towards measurementsand models that quantify various attributes of web sites. The science of measuring allaspects of information; especially its storage and retrieval or informetrics has interestedinformation scientists for decades before the existence of the Web. Is Web informetrics anydifferent; or is it just an application of classical informetrics to a new medium? In this article;we examine this issue by classifying and discussing a wide ranging set of Web metrics.

Association rule mining: A survey,Qiankun Zhao; Sourav S Bhowmick,Data mining [Chen et al. 1996] is the process of extracting interesting (non-trivial; implicit;previously unknown and potentially useful) information or patterns from large informationrepositories such as: relational database; data warehouses; XML repository; etc. Also datamining is known as one of the core processes of Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD).Many people take data mining as a synonym for another popular term; KnowledgeDiscovery in Database (KDD). Alternatively other people treat Data Mining as the coreprocess of KDD. The KDD processes are shown in Figure 1 [Han and Kamber 2000].Usually there are three processes. One is called preprocessing; which is executed beforedata mining techniques are applied to the right data. The preprocessing includes datacleaning; integration; selection and transformation.

Mobile data and transaction management,Sanjay Kumar Madria; Mukesh Mohania; Sourav S Bhowmick; Bharat Bhargava,Abstract Mobile computing paradigm has emerged due to advances in wireless or cellularnetworking technology. This rapidly expanding technology poses many challengingresearch problems in the area of mobile database systems. The mobile users can accessinformation independent of their physical location through wireless connections. However;accessing and manipulating information without restricting users to specific locationscomplicates data processing activities. There are computing constraints that make mobiledatabase processing different from the wired distributed database computing. In this paper;we survey the fundamental research challenges particular to mobile database computing;review some of the proposed solutions and identify some of the upcoming researchchallenges. We discuss interesting research areas; which include mobile location data …,Information Sciences,2002,121
Event detection from evolution of click-through data,Qiankun Zhao; Tie-Yan Liu; Sourav S Bhowmick; Wei-Ying Ma,Abstract Previous efforts on event detection from the web have focused primarily on webcontent and structure data ignoring the rich collection of web log data. In this paper; wepropose the first approach to detect events from the click-through data; which is the log dataof web search engines. The intuition behind event detection from click-through data is thatsuch data is often event-driven and each event can be represented as a set ofquery-pagepairs that are not only semantically similar but also have similar evolution pattern over time.Given the click-through data; in our proposed approach; we first segment it into a sequenceof bipartite graphs based on theuser-defined time granularity. Next; the sequence of bipartitegraphs is represented as a vector-based graph; which records the semantic andevolutionary relationships between queries and pages. After that; the vector-based graph …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,68
Time-dependent semantic similarity measure of queries using historical click-through data,Qiankun Zhao; Steven CH Hoi; Tie-Yan Liu; Sourav S Bhowmick; Michael R Lyu; Wei-Ying Ma,Abstract It has become a promising direction to measure similarity of Web search queries bymining the increasing amount of click-through data logged by Web search engines; whichrecord the interactions between users and the search engines. Most existing approachesemploy the click-through data for similarity measure of queries with little consideration of thetemporal factor; while the click-through data is often dynamic and contains rich temporalinformation. In this paper we present a new framework of time-dependent query semanticsimilarity model on exploiting the temporal characteristics of historical click-through data.The intuition is that more accurate semantic similarity values between queries can beobtained by taking into account the timestamps of the log data. With a set of user-definedcalendar schema and calendar patterns; our time-dependent query similarity model is …,Proceedings of the 15th international conference on World Wide Web,2006,61
An XML Schema integration and query mechanism system,Sanjay Madria; Kalpdrum Passi; Sourav Bhowmick,Abstract The availability of large amounts of heterogeneous distributed web datanecessitates the integration of XML data from multiple XML sources for many reasons. Forexample; currently; there are many e-commerce companies; which offer similar products butuse different XML Schemas with possibly different ontologies. When any two suchcompanies merge; or make an effort to service customers in cooperation; there is a need foran integrated schema and query mechanism for the interoperability of applications. Inapplications like comparison-shopping; there is a need for an illusionary centralizedhomogeneous information system. In this paper; we propose XML Schema integration andquerying methodology. We define an object-oriented data model called XSDM (XMLSchema Data Model) and present a graphical representation of XML Schema for the …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2008,58
Web warehousing: An algebra for web information,W-K Ng; E-P Lim; C-T Huang; Sourav Bhowmick; F-Q Qin,While conventional keyword indexes maintained by web search engines such as Yahoo;Lycos; and World Wide Web Worm work well for most simple keyword searches; they areinadequate when more complex and structured queries involving the underlying hypertextstructure of the World Wide Web are desired. Building from a database perspective; existingwork to support such queries focuses on constructing SQL-like query languages for theWWW that assumes a relational abstraction of the WWW. Nonetheless; the WWW is adirected graph and imposing a relational abstraction filters out its inherent topologicalstructure. We propose a data model for the WWW that retains its topological structure andconstruct a web algebra to manipulate objects in this model. The web algebra establishes aformal foundation from which different web query languages can be designed.,Research and Technology Advances in Digital Libraries; 1998. ADL 98. Proceedings.

A model for XML Schema integration,Kalpdrum Passi; Louise Lane; Sanjay Madria; Bipin C Sakamuri; Mukesh Mohania; Sourav Bhowmick,Abstract We define an object-oriented data model called XSDM (XML Schema Data Model)and present a graphical representation of XML Schema integration. The three layersincluded are; namely; pre-integration; comparison and integration. During pre-integration;the schema present in XML Schema notation is read and is converted into the XSDMnotation. During the comparison phase of integration; correspondences as well as conflictsbetween elements are identified. During the integration phase; conflict resolution;restructuring and merging of the initial schemas take place to obtain the global schema.,International Conference on Electronic Commerce and Web Technologies,2002,56
Tag‐based social image retrieval: An empirical evaluation,Aixin Sun; Sourav S Bhowmick; Nam Nguyen; Khanh Tran; Ge Bai,Abstract Tags associated with social images are valuable information source for superiorimage search and retrieval experiences. Although various heuristics are valuable to boosttag-based search for images; there is a lack of general framework to study the impact ofthese heuristics. Specifically; the task of ranking images matching a given tag query basedon their associated tags in descending order of relevance has not been well studied. In thisarticle; we take the first step to propose a generic; flexible; and extensible framework for thistask and exploit it for a systematic and comprehensive empirical evaluation of variousmethods for ranking images. To this end; we identified five orthogonal dimensions toquantify the matching score between a tagged image and a tag query.

Image tag clarity: in search of visual-representative tags for social images,Aixin Sun; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Tags associated with images in various social media sharing web sites arevaluable information source for superior image retrieval experiences. Due to the nature oftagging; many tags associated with images are not visually descriptive. In this paper; wepropose Normalized Image Tag Clarity (NITC) to evaluate the effectiveness of a tag indescribing the visual content of its annotated images. It is measured by computing the zero-mean normalized distance between the tag language model estimated from the imagesannotated by the tag and the collection language model. The visual-representative tags thatare commonly used to annotate visually similar images are given high tag clarity scores.Evaluated on a large real-world dataset containing more than 269K images and theirassociated tags; we show that NITC score can effectively identify the visual-representative …,Proceedings of the first SIGMM workshop on Social media,2009,50
Web warehousing: Design and issues,Sourav S Bhowmick; Sanjay Kumar Madria; W-K Ng; Ee-Peng Lim,Abstract The World Wide Web is a distributed global information resource. It contains a largeamount of information that have been placed on the web independently by differentorganizations and thus; related information may appear across different web sites. Tomanage and access heterogeneous information on WWW; we have started a project ofbuilding a web warehouse; called Whoweda (W arehouse of W eb D ata). Currently; ourwork on building a web warehousing system has focused on building a data model anddesigning a web algebra. In this paper; we discuss design and research issues in a webwarehousing system. The issues include are designing algebraic operators for webinformation access and manipulation; web data visualization and web knowledge discovery.These issues will not only overcome the limitations of available search engines but also …,*,1999,47
DEQUE: querying the deep web,Denis Shestakov; Sourav S Bhowmick; Ee-Peng Lim,Abstract In this paper; we present a system called DEQUE (D eep WE b QU ery Syst E m) formodeling and querying the deep Web. We propose a data model for representing andstoring HTML forms; and a web form query language called DEQUEL for retrieving data fromthe deep Web and storing them in the format convenient for additional processing. Oursystem is able to query forms (single and consecutive) with input values from relations aswell as from result pages (results of querying web forms). We present a novel approach inmodeling of consecutive forms and introduce the concept of the super form. A prototypesystem has been implemented on a SUN workstation working under Solaris 2.7 using Perlversion 5.005 _2 and employing MySQL (version 3.23. 49) DBMS as the data storage.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2005,42
Information coupling in web databases,Sourav S Bhowmick; Wee-Keong Ng; Ee-Peng Lim,Abstract Web information coupling refers to an association of topically related webdocuments. This coupling is initiated explicitly by a user in a web warehouse speciallydesigned for web information. Web information coupling provides the means to deriveadditional; useful information from the WWW. In this paper; we discuss and show how twoweb operators; ie; global web coupling and local web coupling; are used to associaterelated web information from the WWW and also from multiple web tables in a webwarehouse. This paper discusses various issues in web coupling such as couplingsemantics; coupling-compability; and coupling evaluation.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,1998,40
DTD-Diff: A change detection algorithm for DTDs,Erwin Leonardi; Tran T Hoai; Sourav S Bhowmick; Sanjay Madria,Abstract The DTD of a set of XML documents may change due to many reasons such aschanges to the real-world events; changes to the user's requirements; and mistakes in theinitial design. In this paper; we present a novel algorithm called DTD-D iff to detect thechanges to DTDs that defines the structure of a set of XML documents. Such changedetection tool can be useful in several ways such as maintenance of XML documents;incremental maintenance of relational schema for storing XML data; and XML schemaintegration. We compare DTD-D iff with existing XML change detection approaches andshow that converting DTD to XML schema (XSD)(which is in XML document format) anddetecting the changes using existing XML change detection algorithms is not a feasibleoption. Our experimental results show that DTD-D iff is 5–325 times faster than X-Diff …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2007,39
XML structural delta mining: Issues and challenges,Qiankun Zhao; Ling Chen; Sourav S Bhowmick; Sanjay Madria,Abstract Recently; there is an increasing research efforts in XML data mining. Theseresearch efforts largely assumed that XML documents are static. However; in reality; thedocuments are rarely static. In this paper; we propose a novel research problem called XMLstructural delta mining. The objective of XML structural delta mining is to discover knowledgeby analyzing structural evolution pattern (also called structural delta) of history of XMLdocuments. Unlike existing approaches; XML structural delta mining focuses on the dynamicand temporal features of XML data. Furthermore; the data source for this novel miningtechnique is a sequence of historical versions of an XML document rather than a set ofsnapshot XML documents. Such mining technique can be useful in many applications suchas change detection for very large XML documents; efficient XML indexing; XML search …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2006,38
Private-iye: A framework for privacy preserving data integration,Sourav S Bhowmick; Le Gruenwald; Mizuho Iwaihara; Somchai Chatvichienchai,Data integration has been a long standing challenge to the database and data miningcommunities. This need has become critical in numerous contexts; including building e-commerce market places; sharing data from scientific research; and improving homelandsecurity. However; these important activities are hampered by legitimate and widespreadconcerns of data privacy. It is necessary to develop solutions that enable integration of data;especially in the domains of national priorities; while effective privacy control of the data. Inthis paper; we present an architecture and key research issues for building such a privacypreserving data integration system called PRIVATE-IYE.,Data Engineering Workshops; 2006.

Quantifying tag representativeness of visual content of social images,Aixin Sun; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Social tags describe images from many aspects including the visual contentobservable from the images; the context and usage of images; user opinions and others. Notall tags are therefore useful for image search and are appropriate for tag recommendationwith respect to visual content of images. However; the relationship between a given tag andthe visual content of its tagged images are largely ignored in existing studies on tags and intagging applications. In this paper; we bridge the two orthogonal areas of social imagetagging and query performance prediction in Web search; to quantify tag representativenessof the visual content presented in the annotated images; which is also known as tag visual-representativeness. In simple words; tag visual-representativeness characterizes theeffectiveness of a tag in describing the visual content of the set of images annotated by …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM international conference on Multimedia,2010,37
GBLENDER: towards blending visual query formulation and query processing in graph databases,Changjiu Jin; Sourav S Bhowmick; Xiaokui Xiao; James Cheng; Byron Choi,Abstract Given a graph database D and a query graph g; an exact subgraph matching queryasks for the set S of graphs in D that contain g as a subgraph. This type of queries findimportant applications in several domains such as bioinformatics and chemoinformatics;where users are generally not familiar with complex graph query languages. Consequently;user-friendly visual interfaces which support query graph construction can reduce theburden of data retrieval for these users. Existing techniques for subgraph matching queriesbuilt on top of such visual framework are designed to optimize the time required in retrievingthe result set S from D; assuming that the whole query graph has been constructed. Thisleads to sub-optimal system response time as the query processing is initiated only after theuser has finished drawing the query graph. In this paper; we take the first step towards …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,37
Discovering frequently changing structures from historical structural deltas of unordered XML,Qiankun Zhao; Sourav S Bhowmick; Mukesh Mohania; Yahiko Kambayashi,Abstract Recently; a large amount of work has been done in XML data mining. However; weobserved that most of the existing works focus on the snapshot XML data; while XML data isdynamic in real applications. To the best of our knowledge; none of the existing works hasaddressed the issue of mining the history of changes to XML documents.

Web Bags-Are They Useful in A Web Warehouse?,Sourav S Bhowmick; Sanjay Kumar Madria; Wee Keong Ng; Ee-Peng Lim,Abstract Sets and bags are closely related structures. A bag is di erent from a set in that it issensitive to the number of times an element occurs while a set is not. In this paper; weintroduce the concept of web bag in a web warehouse as a part of our Web InformationCoupling System (WICS). Informally; a web bag is a web table which allows multipleoccurrences of identical web tuples. Web bag helps to discover useful knowledge from aweb table such as visible documents (or web sites); luminous documents and luminouspaths. We formally discuss the semantics and properties of web bags; and illustrate withexamples applications of web bag in knowledge discovery in a web warehouse.,FODO,1998,33
In search of influential event organizers in online social networks,Kaiyu Feng; Gao Cong; Sourav S Bhowmick; Shuai Ma,Abstract Recently; with the emergence of event-based online social services (eg Meetup);there have been increasing online activities to create; distribute; and organize social events.In this paper; we take the first systematic step to discover influential event organizers fromonline social networks who are essential to the overall success of social events. Informally;such event organizers comprise a small group of people who not only have the relevantskills or expertise that are required for an event (eg conference) but they are also able toinfluence largest number of people to actively contribute to it. We formulate it as the problemof mining influential cover set (ICS) where we wish to find k users in a social network G thattogether have the required skills or expertise (modeled as attributes of nodes in G) toorganize an event such that they can influence the greatest number of individuals to …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,31

Modelling and predicting a Web page accesses using Markov processes,Devanshu Dhyani; S Bhowmick; Wee-Keong Ng,The significance of modelling and measuring various attributes of the Web in part or as awhole is undeniable. Although Web related metrics have become increasingly sophisticated;few employ models to explain their measurements. In this paper; we discuss metrics forusage characterization. We considered the application of patterns in browsing behavior ofusers for predicting access to Web documents. We proposed two models based on Markovprocesses for addressing our specification of the access prediction problem. The first adaptsa stochastic model for library circulations; ie; Morse's model in the context of accessing Webdocuments. The second approach can be used for determining access probabilities of Webpages within a site by modelling the browsing process as an ergodic Markov chain.,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 2003.

Join processing in web databases,Sourav S Bhowmick; W-K Ng; E-P Lim; Sanjay Kumar Madria,Abstract Recently; there has been increasing interests in data models and query languagesfor unstructured data in the World Wide Web. When web data is harnessed in a webwarehouse; new and useful information can be derived through appropriate informationmanipulation. In our web warehousing project; we introduce a new operator called the webjoin. Like its relational counterpart; web join combines information from two web tables toyield a new web table.

Social image tag recommendation by concept matching,Aixin Sun; Sourav S Bhowmick; Jun-An Chong,Abstract Tags associated with social images are valuable information source for superiorimage search and retrieval experiences. In this paper; we propose a novel tagrecommendation technique that exploits the user-given tags associated with images. Eachcandidate tag to be recommended is described by a few tag concepts derived from thecollective knowledge embedded in the tag co-occurrence pairs. Each concept; representedby a few tags with high co-occurrences among themselves; is indexed as a textualdocument. Then user-given tags of an image is represented as a text query and thematching concepts are retrieved from the index. The candidate tags associated with thematching concepts are then recommended. Leverages on the well studied InformationRetrieval (IR) techniques; the proposed approach leads to superior tag recommendation …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Multimedia,2011,28
Casino: towards conformity-aware social influence analysis in online social networks,Hui Li; Sourav S Bhowmick; Aixin Sun,Abstract Social influence analysis in online social networks is the study of people's influenceby analyzing the social interactions between individuals. There have been increasingresearch efforts to understand the influence propagation phenomenon due to its importanceto information dissemination among others. Despite the progress achieved by state-of-the-art social influence analysis techniques; a key limitation of these techniques is that they onlyutilize positive interactions (eg; agreement; trust) between individuals; ignoring two equallyimportant factors; namely; negative relationships (eg; distrust; disagreement) betweenindividuals and conformity of people; which refers to a person's inclination to be influenced.In this paper; we propose a novel algorithm CASINO (Conformity-Aware Social INfluencecOmputation) to study the interplay between influence and conformity of each individual …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,28
Mining temporal indirect associations,Ling Chen; Sourav S Bhowmick; Jinyan Li,Abstract This paper presents a novel pattern called temporal indirect association. An indirectassociation pattern refers to a pair of items that rarely occur together but highly depend onthe presence of a mediator itemset. The existing model of indirect association does notconsider the lifespan of items. Consequently; some discovered patterns may be invalid whilesome useful patterns may not be covered. To overcome this drawback; in this paper; we takeinto account the lifespan of items to extend the current model to be temporal. An algorithm;MG-Growth; that finds the set of mediators in pattern-growth manner is developed. Then; weextend the framework of the algorithm to discover temporal indirect associations. Ourexperimental results demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposedalgorithms.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2006,27
Web data management: a warehouse approach,Sourav S Bhowmick; Sanjay K Madria; Wee K Ng,Existence of huge amounts of data on the Web has developed an undeferring need to locateright information at right time; as well as to integrating information effectively to provide acomprehensive source of relevant information. There is a need to develop efficient tools foranalyzing and managing Web data; and efficiently managing Web information from thedatabase perspective. The book proposes a data model called WHOM (Warehouse ObjectModel) to represent HTML and XML documents in the warehouse. It defines a set of webalgebraic operators for building new web tables by extracting relevant data from the Web; aswell as generating new tables from existing ones. These algebraic operators are used forchange detection.,*,2006,26
SUCXENT: An efficient path-based approach to store and query XML documents,Sandeep Prakas; Sourav S Bhowmick; Sanjay Madria,Abstract This paper describes Sucxent; a novel system for the storage and querying of XMLdata using a relational database system (RDBMS). The relational schema proposed underSucxent does not require the knowledge of the DTDs of the XML documents being stored. Inthis approach we store only the leaf nodes and their text values together with their ancestorlist. Doing so will eliminate θ (< or>)-joins to answer XPath-expression based queries. θ-joins account for a major performance bottleneck in current approaches for storing XML datain an RDBMS. We also compare the performance of our system to two existing approachesfor relational storage of XML documents; XRel and XParent; to demonstrate theeffectiveness of our approach. We show that our system performs significantly better thanXRel and XParent in terms of insertion; extraction and querying of XML documents.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2004,26
Conformity-aware influence maximization in online social networks,Hui Li; Sourav S Bhowmick; Aixin Sun; Jiangtao Cui,Abstract Influence maximization (im) is the problem of finding a small subset of nodes (seednodes) in a social network that could maximize the spread of influence. Despite the progressachieved by state-of-the-art greedy im techniques; they suffer from two key limitations. Firstly;they are inefficient as they can take days to find seeds in very large real-world networks.Secondly; although extensive research in social psychology suggests that humans willreadily conform to the wishes or beliefs of others; surprisingly; existing im techniques areconformity-unaware. That is; they only utilize an individual's ability to influence another butignores conformity (a person's inclination to be influenced) of the individuals.

Plasmin triggers a switch-like decrease in thrombospondin-dependent activation of TGF-β1,Lakshmi Venkatraman; Ser-Mien Chia; Balakrishnan Chakrapani Narmada; Jacob K White; Sourav S Bhowmick; C Forbes Dewey Jr; Peter T So; Lisa Tucker-Kellogg; Hanry Yu,Abstract Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a potent regulator of extracellular matrixproduction; wound healing; differentiation; and immune response; and is implicated in theprogression of fibrotic diseases and cancer. Extracellular activation of TGF-β1 from its latentform provides spatiotemporal control over TGF-β1 signaling; but the current understandingof TGF-β1 activation does not emphasize cross talk between activators. Plasmin (PLS) andthrombospondin-1 (TSP1) have been studied individually as activators of TGF-β1; and in thiswork we used a systems-level approach with mathematical modeling and in vitroexperiments to study the interplay between PLS and TSP1 in TGF-β1 activation. Simulationsand steady-state analysis predicted a switch-like bistable transition between two levels ofactive TGF-β1; with an inverse correlation between PLS and TSP1.

Xandy: A scalable change detection technique for ordered XML documents using relational databases,Erwin Leonardi; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Previous work in change detection to XML documents is not suitable for detectingthe changes to large XML documents as it requires a lot of memory to keep the two versionsof XML documents in the memory. In this article; we take a more conservative yet novelapproach of using traditional relational database engines for detecting the changes to largeordered XML documents. To this end; we have implemented a prototype system called Xandy that converts XML documents into relational tuples and detects the changes from thesetuples by using SQL queries. Our experimental results show that the relational-basedapproach has better scalability compared to published algorithm like X-Diff. It hascomparable efficiency and result quality compared to X-Diff in some cases. Our experimentalresults also show that; generally; X andy has better result quality than XyDiff.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2006,24
Detecting changes on unordered XML documents using relational databases: a schema-conscious approach,Erwin Leonardi; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Several relational approaches have been proposed to detect the changes to XMLdocuments by using relational databases. These approaches store the XML documents inthe relational database and issue SQL queries (whenever appropriate) to detect thechanges. All of these relational-based approaches use the schema-oblivious XML storagestrategy for detecting the changes. However; there is growing evidence that schema-conscious storage approaches perform significantly better than schema-obliviousapproaches as far as XML query processing is concerned. In this paper; we study arelational-based unordered XML change detection technique (called H< small>ELIOS</small>) that uses a schema-conscious approach (Shared-Inlining) as the underlyingstorage strategy. H< small> ELIOS</small> is up to 52 times faster than X-Diff [7] for large …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2005,24

FRACTURE mining: mining frequently and concurrently mutating structures from historical XML documents,Ling Chen; Sourav S Bhowmick; Liang-Tien Chia,Abstract In the past few years; the fast proliferation of available XML documents hasstimulated a great deal of interest in discovering hidden and nontrivial knowledge from XMLrepositories. However; to the best of our knowledge; none of existing work on XML mininghas taken into account of the dynamic nature of XML documents as online information. Thepresent article proposes a novel type of frequent pattern; namely; FRequently AndConcurrently muTating substructUREs (FRACTURE); that is mined from the evolution of anXML document. A discovered FRACTURE is a set of substructures of an XML document thatfrequently change together.

Efficient recursive XML query processing using relational database systems,Sandeep Prakash; Sourav S Bhowmick; Sanjay Madria,Abstract Recursive queries are quite important in the context of XML databases. In addition;several recent papers have investigated a relational approach to store XML data and thereis growing evidence that schema-conscious approaches are a better option than schema-oblivious techniques as far as query performance is concerned. However; the issue ofrecursive XML queries for such approaches has not been dealt with satisfactorily. In thispaper we argue that it is possible to design a schema-oblivious approach that outperformsschema-conscious approaches for certain types of recursive queries. To that end; wepropose a novel schema-oblivious approach; called S ucxent++ (Schema Unconcious XMLEnabled System); that outperforms existing schema-oblivious approaches such as XParentby up to 15 times and schema-conscious approaches (Shared-Inlining) by up to eight …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2006,23
Prague: towards blending practical visual subgraph query formulation and query processing,Changjiu Jin; Sourav S Bhowmick; Byron Choi; Shuigeng Zhou,In a previous paper; we laid out the vision of a novel graph query processing paradigmwhere instead of processing a visual query graph after its construction; it interleaves visualquery formulation and processing by exploiting the latency offered by the GUI to filterirrelevant matches and prefetch partial query results [8]. Our first attempt at implementing thisvision; called GBLENDER [8]; shows significant improvement in system response time (SRT)for sub graph containment queries. However; GBLENDER suffers from two key drawbacks;namely inability to handle visual sub graph similarity queries and inefficient support forvisual query modification; limiting its usage in practical environment. In this paper; wepropose a novel algorithm called PRAGUE (Practical visu Al Graph QUery Blender); thataddresses these limitations by exploiting a novel data structure called spindle-shaped …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,21
A multi-version transaction model to improve data availability in mobile computing,Sanjay Kumar Madria; Mohammed Baseer; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract In this paper; we present a multi-version transaction model; which exploits versionsto increase availability in a mobile database environment. Each transaction in our model iseither in start; committed or terminated state. A transaction can start and commit at mobilehost (MH) but terminates only at mobile service station (MSS). We first present a two-versionmodel; where each data object can have two versions; one committed and the other isterminated. A read transaction is never blocked; as it is always made available either acommitted or a terminated version. We have extended the model to handle multiversions.,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2002,21
Why not; WINE?: towards answering why-not questions in social image search,Sourav S Bhowmick; Aixin Sun; Ba Quan Truong,Abstract Despite considerable progress in recent years on Tag-based Social ImageRetrieval (TagIR); state-of-the-art TagIR systems fail to provide a systematic framework forend users to ask why certain images are not in the result set of a given query and provide anexplanation for such missing results. However; as humans; such why-not questions arenatural when expected images are missing in the query results returned by a TagIR system.Clearly; it would be very helpful to users if they could pose follow-up why-not questions toseek clarifications on missing images in query results. In this work; we take the first step tosystematically answer the why-not questions posed by end-users on TagIR systems. Ouranswer not only involves the reason why desired images are missing in the results but alsosuggestion on how the query can be altered so that the user can view these missing …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Multimedia,2013,19
MESSIAH: missing element-conscious SLCA nodes search in XML data,BQ Truong; Sourav S Bhowmick; Curtis E Dyreson; Aixin Sun,Abstract Keyword search for smallest lowest common ancestors (SLCAs) in XML data hasbeen widely accepted as a meaningful way to identify matching nodes where their subtreescontain an input set of keywords. Although SLCA and its variants (eg; MLCA) performadmirably in identifying matching nodes; surprisingly; they perform poorly for searches onirregular schemas that have missing elements; that is;(sub) elements that are optional; orappear in some instances of an element type but not all (eg; a" population" subelement in a"city" element might be optional; appearing when the population is known and absent whenthe population is unknown). In this paper; we generalize the SLCA search paradigm tosupport queries involving missing elements. Specifically; we propose a novel property calledoptionality resilience that specifies the desired behaviors of an XML keyword search (XKS …,Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,19
VOGUE: Towards A Visual Interaction-aware Graph Query Processing Framework.,Sourav S Bhowmick; Byron Choi; Shuigeng Zhou,ABSTRACT Due to the complexity of graph query languages; the need for visual queryinterfaces that can reduce the burden of query formulation is fundamental to the spreading ofgraph data management tools to wider community. We present a novel hci (human-computer interaction)-aware graph query processing paradigm; where instead of processinga query graph after its construction; it interleaves visual query construction and processing toimprove system response time. We present the architecture of a system called vogue thatexploits gui latency to prune false results and prefetch candidate data graphs by employinga novel action-aware indexing and query processing schemes. We discuss various non-traditional design challenges and innovative features of vogue and highlight its practicality inevaluating subgraph queries.,CIDR,2013,19
Content is still king: the effect of neighbor voting schemes on tag relevance for social image retrieval,Ba Quan Truong; Aixin Sun; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Tags associated with social images are valuable information source for superior tag-based image retrieval (TagIR) experiences. One of the key issues in TagIR is to learn theeffectiveness of a tag in describing the visual content of its annotated image; also known astag relevance. One of the most effective approaches in the literature for tag relevancelearning is neighbor voting. In this approach a tag is considered more relevant to itsannotated image (also known as the seed image) if the tag is also used to annotate theneighbor images (nearest neighbors by visual similarity). However; the state-of-the-artapproach that realizes the neighbor voting scheme does not explore the possibility ofexploiting the content (eg.; degree of visual similarity between the seed and neighborimages) and contextual (eg.; tag association by co-occurrence) features of social images …,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM international conference on multimedia retrieval,2012,19
COWES: Web user clustering based on evolutionary web sessions,Ling Chen; Sourav S Bhowmick; Wolfgang Nejdl,Abstract As one of the most important tasks of Web Usage Mining (WUM); web userclustering; which establishes groups of users exhibiting similar browsing patterns; providesuseful knowledge to personalized web services and motivates long term research interestsin the web community. Most of the existing approaches cluster web users based on thesnapshots of web usage data; although web usage data are evolutionary in the nature.Consequently; the usefulness of the knowledge discovered by existing web user clusteringapproaches might be limited. In this paper; we address this problem by clustering web usersbased on the evolution of web usage data. Given a set of web users and their associatedhistorical web usage data; we study how their usage data change over time and mineevolutionary patterns from each user's usage history. The discovered patterns capture the …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2009,19
Bio2X: a rule-based approach for semi-automatic transformation of semi-structured biological data to XML,Song Yang; Sourav S Bhowmick; Sanjay Madria,Abstract Data integration of geographically dispersed; heterogeneous; complex biologicaldatabases is a key research area. One of the key features of a successful data integrationsystem is to have a simple self-describing data exchange format. However; many of thebiological databases provide data in flat files which are poor data exchange formats.Fortunately; XML can be viewed as a powerful data model and better data exchange format.In this paper; we present the Bio2X system that transforms flat file data into highlyhierarchical XML data using rule-based machine learning technique. Bio2X has been fullyimplemented using Java. Our experiments to transform real world biological datademonstrate the effectiveness of the Bio2X approach.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2005,19

Towards efficient authenticated subgraph query service in outsourced graph databases,Zhe Fan; Yun Peng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Sourav S Bhowmick,Graphs are powerful tools suitable for a large variety of applications including chemicaldatabases and the Semantic Web; among others. A fundamental query of graph databasesis the subgraph query: given a query graph q; it retrieves the data graphs from a databasethat contain q. Due to the cost of managing massive data coupled with the computationalhardness of subgraph query processing; outsourcing the processing to a third-party serviceprovider is an appealing alternative. However; security properties such as data integrity andthe response time are critical Quality of Service (QoS) issues in query services.Unfortunately; to our knowledge; authenticated subgraph query services have not beenaddressed before. To support the service; we propose Merkle IFTree (MIFTree) whereMerkle hash trees are applied into our Intersection-aware Feature-subgraph Tree (IFTree) …,IEEE Transactions on Services Computing,2014,18
Blog cascade affinity: analysis and prediction,Hui Li; Sourav S Bhowmick; Aixin Sun,Abstract Information propagation within the blogosphere is of much importance inimplementing policies; marketing research; launching new products; and other applications.In this paper; we take a microscopic view of the information propagation pattern inblogosphere by investigating blog cascade affinity. A blog cascade is a group of posts linkedtogether discussing about the same topic; and cascade affnity refers to the phenomenon of ablog's inclination to join a specific cascade. We identify and analyze an array of features thatmay affect a blogger's cascade joining behavior and utilize these features to predict cascadeaffinity of blogs. Evaluated on a real dataset consisting of 873;496 posts; our svm-basedprediction achieved accuracy of 0.723 measured by F1. Our experiments also showed thatamong all features identified; the number of friends was the most important factor affecting …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,17
A transaction model and multiversion concurrency control for mobile database systems,Sanjay Kumar Madria; Mohammed Baseer; Vijay Kumar; Sourav Bhowmick,Abstract Transaction management on Mobile Database Systems (MDS) has to cope with anumber of constraints such as limited bandwidth; low processing power; unreliablecommunication; and mobility etc. As a result of these constraints; traditional concurrencycontrol mechanisms are unable to manage transactional activities to maintain availability.Innovative transaction execution schemes and concurrency control mechanisms aretherefore required to exploit the full potential of MDS. In this paper; we report ourinvestigation on a multi-versions transaction processing approach and a deadlock-freeconcurrency control mechanism based on multiversion two-phase locking schemeintegrated with a timestamp approach. We study the behavior of the proposed model with asimulation study in a MDS environment. We have compared our schemes using a …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2007,17
Mining maximal frequently changing subtree patterns from XML documents,Ling Chen; Sourav S Bhowmick; Liang-Tien Chia,Abstract Due to the dynamic nature of online information; XML documents typically evolveover time. The change of the data values or structures of an XML document may exhibitsome particular patterns. In this paper; we focus on the sequence of changes to thestructures of an XML document to find out which subtrees in the XML structure frequentlychange together; which we call Frequently Changing Subtree Patterns (FCSP). In order tokeep the discovered patterns more concise; we further define the problem of mining maximalFCSPs. An algorithm derived from the FP-growth is developed to mine the set of maximalFCSP s. Experiment results show that our algorithm is substantially faster than the naivealgorithm and it scales well with respect to the size of the XML structure.,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2004,17
Mining association rules from structural deltas of historical xml documents,Ling Chen; Sourav S Bhowmick; Liang-Tien Chia,Abstract Previous work on XML association rule mining focuses on mining from the dataexisting in XML documents at a certain time point. However; due to the dynamic nature ofonline information; an XML document typically evolves over time. Knowledge obtained frommining the evolvement of an XML document would be useful in a wide range of applications;such as XML indexing; XML clustering. In this paper; we propose to mine a novel type ofassociation rules from a sequence of changes to XML structure; which we call XMLStructural Delta Association Rule (XSD-AR). We formulate the problem of XSD-AR mining byconsidering both the frequency and the degree of changes to XML structure. An algorithm;which is derived from the FP-growth; and its optimizing strategy are developed for theproblem. Preliminary experiment results show that our algorithm is efficient and scalable …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2004,17
Detecting and representing relevant web deltas in WHOWEDA,Sourav S.  Bhowmick; Sanjay Kumar  Madria; Wee Keong Ng,In this paper; we present a mechanism for detecting and representing changes; given theold and new versions of a set of interlinked Web documents; retrieved in response to auser's query. In particular; we show how to detect and represent Web deltas; ie; changes inthe Web documents that are relevant to a user's query in the context of our Webwarehousing system called WHOWEDA (Warehouse of Web Data). In WHOWEDA; Webinformation is materialized views stored in Web tables in the form of Web tuples. These Webtuples; represented as directed graphs; can be manipulated using a set of Web algebraicoperators. In this paper; we present a mechanism to detect relevant Web deltas using Webalgebraic operators such as the Web join and the outer Web join. Web join is used to detectidentical documents residing in two Web tables; whereas; outer Web join; a derivative of …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2003,17
Prism: Concept-preserving social image search results summarization,Boon-Siew Seah; Sourav S Bhowmick; Aixin Sun,Abstract Most existing tag-based social image search engines present search results as aranked list of images; which cannot be consumed by users in a natural and intuitive manner.In this paper; we present a novel concept-preserving image search results summarizationalgorithm named Prism. Prism exploits both visual features and tags of the search results togenerate high quality summary; which not only breaks the results into visually andsemantically coherent clusters but it also maximizes the coverage of the summary wrt theoriginal search results. It first constructs a visual similarity graph where the nodes areimages in the search results and the edges represent visual similarities between pairs ofimages. This graph is optimally decomposed and compressed into a set of concept-preserving subgraphs based on a set of summarization objectives.

Characterizing and predicting community members from evolutionary and heterogeneous networks,Qiankun Zhao; Sourav S Bhowmick; Xin Zheng; Kai Yi,Abstract Mining different types of communities from web data have attracted a lot of researchefforts in recent years. However; none of the existing community mining techniques hastaken into account both the dynamic as well as heterogeneous nature of web data. In thispaper; we propose to characterize and predict community members from the evolution ofheterogeneous web data. We first propose a general framework for analyzing the evolutionof heterogeneous networks. Then; the academic network; which is extracted from 1 millioncomputer science papers; is used as an example to illustrate the framework. Finally; twoexample applications of the academic network are presented. Experimental results with areal and very large heterogeneous academic network show that our proposed frameworkcan produce good results in terms of community member recommendation. Also; novel …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,16
DTD-Diff: a change detection algorithm for DTDs,Erwin Leonardi; Tran T Hoai; Sourav S Bhowmick; Sanjay Madria,Abstract The DTD of a set of XML documents may change due to many reasons such aschanges to the real world events; changes to the user's requirements; and mistakes in theinitial design. In this paper; we present a novel algorithm called DTD-Diff to detect thechanges to DTDs that defines the structure of a set of XML documents. Such changedetection tool can be useful in several ways such as maintenance of XML documents;incremental maintenance of relational schema for storing XML data; and XML schemaintegration. We compare DTD-Diff with existing XML change detection approaches andshow that converting DTD to XML Schema (XSD)(which is in XML document format) anddetecting the changes using existing XML change detection algorithms is not a feasibleoption. Our experimental results show that DTD-Diff is 5–325 times faster than X-Diff …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2006,16
AffRank: Affinity‐driven ranking of products in online social rating networks,Hui Li; Sourav S Bhowmick; Aixin Sun,Abstract Large online social rating networks (eg; Epinions; Blippr) have recently come intobeing containing information related to various types of products. Typically; each product inthese networks is associated with a group of members who have provided ratings andcomments on it. These people form a product community. A potential member can join aproduct community by giving a new rating to the product. We refer to this phenomenon of aproduct community's ability to “attract” new members as product affinity. The knowledge of aranked list of products based on product affinity is of much importance for implementingpolicies; marketing research; online advertisement; and other applications. In this article; weidentify and analyze an array of features that exert effect on product affinity and propose anovel model; called AffRank; that utilizes these features to predict the future rank of …,Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology,2011,15
XML data integration based on content and structure similarity using keys,Waraporn Viyanon; Sanjay K Madria; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract This paper proposes a technique for approximately matching XML data based onthe content and structure by detecting the similarity of subtrees clustered semantically usingleaf-node parents. The leaf-node parents are considered as a root of a subtree which is thenrecursively traversed bottom-up for matching. First; we take advantage of the “key” formatching subtrees which reduces the number of comparisons dramatically. Second; wemeasure the similarity degree based on data and structures of the two XML documents. Theresults show that our approach finds much more accurate matches with or without thepresence of keys in XML subtrees. Other approaches experience problems with similaritymatching thresholds as they either ignore semantic information available or have problemsin handling complex XML data.,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2008,15
Efficient support for ordered xpath processing in tree-unaware commercial relational databases,Boon-Siew Seah; Klarinda G Widjanarko; Sourav S Bhowmick; Byron Choi; Erwin Leonardi,Abstract In this paper; we present a novel ordered xpath evaluation in tree-unaware rdbms.The novelties of our approach lies in the followings.(a) We propose a novel xml storagescheme which comprises only leaf nodes; their corresponding data values; order encodingsand their root-to-leaf paths.(b) We propose an algorithm for mapping ordered xpath queriesinto sql queries over the storage scheme.(c) We propose an optimization technique thatenforces all mapped sql queries to be evaluated in a “left-to-right” join order. By employingthese techniques; we show; through a comprehensive experiment; that our approach notonly scales well but also performs better than some representative tree-unawareapproaches on more than 65% of our benchmark queries with the highest observed gainfactor being 1939. In addition; our approach reduces significantly the performance gap …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,15
WAM-Miner: in the search of web access motifs from historical web log data,Qiankun Zhao; Sourav S Bhowmick; Le Gruenwald,Abstract Existing web usage mining techniques focus only on discovering knowledge basedon the statistical measures obtained from the static characteristics of web usage data. Theydo not consider the dynamic nature of web usage data. In this paper; we focus ondiscovering novel knowledge by analyzing the change patterns of historical web accesssequence data. We present an algorithm called W< small> AM</small>-M< small>INER</small> to discover Web Access Motifs (WAMs). WAMs are web access patterns thatnever change or do not change significantly most of the time (if not always) in terms of theirsupport values during a specific time period. WAMs are useful for many applications; suchas intelligent web advertisement; web site restructuring; business intelligence; andintelligent web caching.,Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2005,15
DiffXML: change detection in XML data,Yan Chen; Sanjay Madria; Sourav Bhowmick,Abstract In this paper; we introduce a method to map XML files to relational data model byparsing XML files as DOM trees and store value and path information for each node inrelational tables. We present an algorithm called “DiffXML” which uses SQL operations todetect changes between two versions of XML file stored in a relational database. The valueand path information for XML files are also used to detect differences. DiffXML finds newinserted; deleted and updated nodes; and also finds the move of a subtree from one place tothe other in the XML DOM tree. We analyze the performance of DiffXML with some currentcommercial and research prototype XML change detection tools.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2004,15
Web schemas in WHOWEDA,Saurav S Bhowmick; Wee Keong Ng; Sanjay Madria,ABSTRACT The term schema denotes whatever way a data model chooses to model itsdata. In this paper we discuss schemas of a set of HTML or XML documents retrieved fromthe Web in the context of our web warehousing system called Whoweda (WareHouse OfWEb DAta). Web schemas are used to bind a web table that contains a collection ofinterlinked web documents called web tuples. These schemas specify some of the metadata;content and structural properties (in the form of predicates) shared by some of the Webdocuments and hyperlinks in the web table. They also summarize the hyperlink structure ofthese documents using the notion of connectivities. We show how web schemas aregenerated in Whoweda and discuss different types of operation that may be performed onweb schemas.,Proceedings of the 3rd ACM international workshop on Data warehousing and OLAP,2000,15
Authenticated subgraph similarity searchin outsourced graph databases,Yun Peng; Zhe Fan; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Sourav S Bhowmick,Subgraph similarity search is used in graph databases to retrieve graphs whose subgraphsare similar to a given query graph. It has been proven successful in a wide range ofapplications including bioinformatics and chem-informatics; etc. Due to the cost of providingefficient similarity search services on ever-increasing graph data; database outsourcing isapparently an appealing solution to database owners. Unfortunately; query serviceproviders may be untrusted or compromised by attacks. To our knowledge; no studies havebeen carried out on the authentication of the search. In this paper; we proposeauthentication techniques that follow the popular filtering-and-verification framework. Wepropose an authentication-friendly metric index called GMTree.

QUBLE: towards blending interactive visual subgraph search queries on large networks,Ho Hoang Hung; Sourav S Bhowmick; Ba Quan Truong; Byron Choi; Shuigeng Zhou,Abstract In a previous paper; we laid out the vision of a novel graph query processingparadigm where instead of processing a visual query graph after its construction; itinterleaves visual query formulation and processing by exploiting the latency offered by thegui to filter irrelevant matches and prefetch partial query results [8]. Our recent attempts atimplementing this vision [8; 9] show significant improvement in system response time (srt) forsubgraph queries. However; these efforts are designed specifically for graph databasescontaining a large collection of small or medium-sized graphs. In this paper; we propose anovel algorithm called quble (QUery Blender for Large nEtworks) to realize this visualsubgraph querying paradigm on very large networks (eg; protein interaction networks; socialnetworks).

DualAligner: a dual alignment-based strategy to align protein interaction networks,Boon-Siew Seah; Sourav S Bhowmick; C Forbes Dewey Jr,Abstract Motivation: Given the growth of large-scale protein–protein interaction (PPI)networks obtained across multiple species and conditions; network alignment is now animportant research problem. Network alignment performs comparative analysis acrossmultiple PPI networks to understand their connections and relationships. However; PPI datain high-throughput experiments still suffer from significant false-positive and false-negativesrates. Consequently; high-confidence network alignment across entire PPI networks is notpossible. At best; local network alignment attempts to alleviate this problem by completelyignoring low-confidence mappings; global network alignment; on the other hand; pairs allproteins regardless. To this end; we propose an alternative strategy: instead of full alignmentacross the entire network or completely ignoring low-confidence regions; we aim to …,Bioinformatics,2014,14
Mining positive and negative association rules from XML query patterns for caching,Ling Chen; Sourav S Bhowmick; Liang-Tien Chia,Abstract Recently; several approaches that mine frequent XML query patterns and cachetheir results have been proposed to improve query response time. However; frequent XMLquery patterns mined by these approaches ignore the temporal sequence between userqueries. In this paper; we take into account the temporal features of user queries to discoverassociation rules; which indicate that when a user inquires some information from the XMLdocument; she/he will probably inquire some other information subsequently. We clusterXML queries according to their semantics first and then mine association rules between theclusters. Moreover; not only positive but also negative association rules are discovered todesign the appropriate cache replacement strategy. The experimental results showed thatour approach considerably improved the caching performance by significantly reducing …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2005,14

For example; some young users may not know that Walkman playedsimilar function as iPod does nowadays. In this paper; we approach the temporalcorrespondence problem in which; given an input term (eg; iPod) and the target time (eg1980s); the task is to find the counterpart of the query that existed in the target time. Wepropose an approach that transforms word contexts across time based on their neuralnetwork representations.

Our scheme is built on top of our S< scp> UCXENT</scp>++ system.We show that by exploiting the encoding scheme of S< scp> UCXENT</scp>++; we candevise efficient strategy for evaluating such twig queries.

Xanadue: a system for detecting changes to xml data in tree-unaware relational databases,Erwin Leonardi; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Recently; a number of main memory algorithms for detecting the changes to XMLdata have been proposed. These approaches are not suitable for detecting changes to largeXML document as it requires a lot of memory to keep the two versions of XML documents inthe memory. We have developed a novel XML change detection system; called XANADUEthat uses traditional relational database engines for detecting changes to large XML data. Inthis approach; we store the XML documents in the relational database and issue SQLqueries (whenever appropriate) to detect the changes. This demonstration will showcase thefunctionality of our system and the effectiveness of XML change detection in relationalenvironment.,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,12
COWES: clustering web users based on historical web sessions,Ling Chen; Sourav S Bhowmick; Jinyan Li,Abstract Clustering web users is one of the most important research topics in web usagemining. Existing approaches cluster web users based on the snapshots of web usersessions. They do not take into account the dynamic nature of web usage data. In this paper;we focus on discovering novel knowledge by clustering web users based on the evolutionsof their historical web sessions. We present an algorithm called COWES to cluster web usersin three steps. First; given a set of web users; we mine the history of their web sessions toextract interesting patterns that capture the characteristics of their usage data evolution.Then; the similarity between web users is computed based on their common interestingpatterns.

BioDIFF: an effective fast change detection algorithm for genomic and proteomic data,Yang Song; Sourav S Bhowmick,A key issue in biological data integration is how to detect changes to the underlyingbiological data sources. In this poster; we present an algorithm called BioDiff for detectingexact changes to genomic and proteomic data. In our approach we transformheterogeneous genomic and proteomic data to XML format and then detect changesbetween two versions of XML representation of biological data. Our algorithm extends X-Diff[2]; a published XML change detection algorithm. X-Diff algorithm can detect the optimumdifferences between two unordered XML documents in a polynomial time. It works for anytype of XML data. However; we believe that it is not efficient to apply X-Diff directly to detectchanges to XML representation of biological data.

Mining history of changes to web access patterns,Qiankun Zhao; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Recently; a lot of work has been done in web usage mining [2]. Among them;mining of frequent Web Access Pattern (WAP) is the most well researched issue [1]. Theidea is to transform web logs into sequences of events with user identifications andtimestamps; and then extract association and sequential patterns from the events data withcertain metrics. The frequent WAPs have been applied to a wide range of applications suchas personalization; system improvement; site modification; business intelligence; and usagecharacterization [2]. However; most of the existing techniques focus only on mining frequentWAP from snapshot web usage data; while web usage data is dynamic in real life. While thefrequent WAPs are useful in many applications; knowledge hidden behind the historicalchanges of web usage data; which reflects how WAPs change; is also critical to many …,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2004,12
Detecting content changes on ordered XML documents using relational databases,Erwin Leonardi; Sourav S Bhowmick; TS Dharma; Sanjay Madria,Abstract Previous works in change detection on XML focused on detecting changes to textfile using ordered and unordered tree model. These approaches are not suitable fordetecting changes to large XML document as it requires a lot of memory to keep the twoversions of XML documents in the memory. In this paper; we take a more conservative yetnovel approach of using traditional relational database engines for detecting contentchanges of ordered large XML data. First; we store XML documents in RDBMS. Then; wedetect the changes by using a set of SQL queries. Experimental results show that ourapproach has better scalability; better performance; and comparable result quality comparedto the state-of-the-art approaches.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2004,12

Pani: a novel algorithm for fast discovery of putative target nodes in signaling networks,Huey-Eng Chua; Qing Zhao; Sourav S Bhowmick; C Forbes Dewey Jr; Lisa Tucker-Kellogg; Hanry Yu,Abstract In biological network analysis; the goal of the target identification problem is topredict molecule to inhibit (or activate) to achieve optimum efficacy and safety for a diseasetreatment. A related problem is the target prioritization problem which predicts a subset ofmolecules in a given disease-related network which contains successful drug targets withhighest probability. Sensitivity analysis prioritizes targets in a dynamic network model usingprincipled criteria; but fails to penalize off-target effects; and does not scale for largenetworks. We describe Pani (Putative TArget Nodes PrIoritization); a novel method thatprunes and ranks the possible target nodes by exploiting concentration-time profiles andnetwork structure (topological) information.

Representation of web data in a web warehouse,Sourav S Bhowmick; Sanjay Madria; Wee Keong Ng,Abstract We believe that; to manage Web data effectively; there is a need to build a datawarehouse of Web data; ie a Web warehouse. In this paper; we focus on how to representand store relevant hyperlinked Web documents effectively in a Web warehouse calledWhoweda (WareHouse Of WEb DAta) for further querying and manipulation. We present asimple and general model for representing metadata; structure and content of Webdocuments and hyperlinks in Whoweda. We discuss node and link objects which are used torepresent Web documents and hyperlinks respectively in Whoweda. These objects are firstclass objects in our data model called WHOM (WareHouse Object Model) which is designedto represent and manipulate Web data in the warehouse. An important feature of our modelis that it represents metadata; content and structure as trees called node and link …,The Computer Journal,2003,11
Clustering and summarizing protein-protein interaction networks: A survey,Sourav S Bhowmick; Boon Siew Seah,The increasing availability and significance of large-scale protein-protein interaction (PPI)data has resulted in a flurry of research activity to comprehend the organization; processes;and functioning of cells by analyzing these data at network level. Network clustering; thatanalyzes the topological and functional properties of a PPI network to identify clusters ofinteracting proteins; has gained significant popularity in the bioinformatics as well as datamining research communities. Many studies since the last decade have shown thatclustering PPI networks is an effective approach for identifying functional modules; revealingfunctions of unknown proteins; etc. In this paper; we examine this issue by classifying;discussing; and comparing a wide ranging approaches proposed by the bioinformaticscommunity to cluster PPI networks. A pervasive desire of this review is to emphasize the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,10
Getreal: Towards realistic selection of influence maximization strategies in competitive networks,Hui Li; Sourav S Bhowmick; Jiangtao Cui; Yunjun Gao; Jianfeng Ma,Abstract State-of-the-art classical influence maximization (IM) techniques are" competition-unaware" as they assume that a group (company) finds seeds (users) in a networkindependent of other groups who are also simultaneously interested in finding such seeds inthe same network. However; in reality several groups often compete for the same market(eg; Samsung; HTC; and Apple for the smart phone market) and hence may attempt to selectseeds in the same network. This has led to increasing body of research in devising IMtechniques for competitive networks. Despite the considerable progress made by theseefforts toward finding seeds in a more realistic settings; unfortunately; they still make severalunrealistic assumptions (eg; a new company being aware of a rival's strategy; alternate seedselection; etc.) making their deployment impractical in real-world networks.

QUBLE: Blending Visual Subgraph Query Formulation with Query Processing on Large Networks,H H Hung; Sourav S Bhowmick; BQ Truong; Byron Choi; Shuigeng Zhou,Abstract In a previous paper; we laid out the vision of a novel graph query processingparadigm where instead of processing a visual query graph after its construction; itinterleaves visual query formulation and processing by exploiting the latency offered by theGUI [4]. Our recent attempts at implementing this vision [4; 6]; show significant improvementin the system response time (SRT) for subgraph queries. However; these efforts aredesigned specifically for graph databases containing a large collection of small or medium-sized graphs. Consequently; its frequent fragment-based action-aware indexing schemesand query processing strategy are unsuitable for supporting subgraph queries on largenetworks containing thousands of nodes and edges. In this demonstration; we present anovel system called QUBLE (QUery Blender for Large nEtworks) to realize this novel …,Proceedings of 39th ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,10
Xblend: Visual xml query formulation meets query processing,Zhou Yong; Sourav S Bhowmick; Erwin Leonardi; Klarinda G Widjanarko,Due to the complexity of XML query languages; the need for visual query interfaces that canreduce the burden of query formulation is fundamental to the spreading of XML to widercommunity. We present a RDBMS-based XML query evaluation system; called XBLEND;that takes a novel and on traditional approach to improving query performance by blendingvisual query formulation and query processing. It exploits the latency offered by GUI-basedvisual query formulation to prefetch portions of the query results. The basic idea is that weprefetch constituent path expressions; store the synopsis of intermediary results; reuse themwhen connective is added or" Run" is pressed. In our demonstration we show that oursystem exhibits promising performance in evaluating XML queries and show its usefulnessin life sciences domain.,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09.

Efficient processing of XPath queries using indexes,Sanjay Madria; Yan Chen; Kalpdrum Passi; Sourav Bhowmick,Abstract A number of indexing techniques have been proposed in recent times for optimizingthe queries on XML and other semi-structured data models. Most of the semi-structuredmodels use tree-like structures and query languages (XPath; XQuery; etc.) which make useof regular path expressions to optimize the query processing. In this paper; we propose twoalgorithms called Entry-point algorithm (EPA) and Two-point Entry algorithms that exploitdifferent types of indices to efficiently process XPath queries. We discuss and compare twoapproaches namely; Root-first and Bottom-first in implementing the EPA. We present theexperimental results of the algorithms using XML benchmark queries and data and comparethe results with that of traditional methods of query processing with and without the use ofindexes; and ToXin indexing approach. Our algorithms show improved performance …,Information Systems,2007,10
Efficient recursive XML query processing in relational database systems,Sandeep Prakash; Sourav S Bhowmick; Sanjay Madria,Abstract There is growing evidence that schema-conscious approaches are a better optionthan schema-oblivious techniques as far as XML query performance is concerned inrelational environment. However; the issue of recursive XML queries for such approacheshas not been dealt with satisfactorily. In this paper we argue that it is possible to design aschema-oblivious approach that outperforms schema-conscious approaches for certaintypes of recursive queries. To that end; we propose a novel schema-oblivious approachcalled Sucxent++ that outperforms existing schema-oblivious approaches such as XParentby up to 15 times and schema-conscious approaches (Shared-Inlining) by up to 3 times forrecursive query execution. Our approach has up to 2 times smaller storage requirementscompared to existing schema-oblivious approaches and 10% less than schema …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2004,10
Discovering pattern-based dynamic structures from versions of unordered XML documents,Qiankun Zhao; Sourav S Bhowmick; Sanjay Madria,Abstract Existing works on XML data mining deal with snapshot XML data only; while XMLdata is dynamic in real applications. In this paper; we discover knowledge from XML data bytaking account its dynamic nature. We present a novel approach to extract pattern-baseddynamic structures from versions of unordered XML documents. With the proposed dynamicmetrics; the pattern-based dynamic structures are expected to summarize and predictinteresting change trends of certain structures based on their past behaviors. Two types ofpattern-based dynamic structures; increasing dynamic structure and decreasing dynamicstructure are considered. With our proposed data model; SMH-Tree; an algorithm for miningsuch pattern-based dynamic structures with only two scans of the XML sequence ispresented. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can extract the pattern …,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2004,10
Deriving and verifying statistical distribution of a hyperlink-based web page quality metric,Devanshu Dhyani; Sourav S Bhowmick; Wee-Keong Ng,Abstract The significance of modeling and measuring various attributes of the Web in part oras a whole is undeniable. Modeling information phenomena on the Web constitutesfundamental research towards an understanding that will contribute to the goal of increasingits utility. Although Web related metrics have become increasingly sophisticated; few employmodels to explain their measurements. In this paper; we discuss issues related to metrics forWeb page significance. These metrics are used for ranking the quality and relevance of Webpages in response to user needs. We focus on the problem of ascertaining the statisticaldistribution of some well-known hyperlink-based Web page quality metrics. Based onempirical distributions of Web page degrees; we derived analytically the probabilitydistribution for the PageRank metric.

From the power lawdistribution of Web page degrees; we derived other interesting laws that hold for the Websuch as Mandelbrot's law; Leimkuhler's law and Bradford's law. We introduced the theory ofinformation producing processes that serves as a generic framework for studying theinterrelationships between these informetric regularities.

Association rules for Web data mining in WHOWEDA,Sanjay Kumar Madria; Chris Raymond; Sourav Bhowmick; Mukesh Mohania,The authors discuss association rules which can be discovered from Web data. Theassociation rules are discussed within the scope of our WHOWEDA (warehouse of Webdata) project. WHOWEDA is supported by a Web data model and a set of algebraicoperators. The Web data model allows a uniform and integrated view of Web data gatheredusing a user's query graph. A user's query graph describes the query by example (what theuser perceives as the query) and the Web coupling query gathers instances of such a querygraph from the Web and stores them in the form of subgraphs (called Web tuples) in a Webtable. We discuss association rules within this domain. An association rule defines anassociation between the nodes and links attributes of Web tuples within a Web table.

This paper introduces a novel problem called the best region search (BRS)problem and provides efficient solutions to it. Given a set O of spatial objects; a submodularmonotone aggregate score function; and the size axb of a query rectangle; the BRS problemaims to find axb rectangular region such that the aggregate score of the spatial objectsinside the region is maximized. This problem is fundamental to support several real-worldapplications such as most influential region search (eg. the best location for a signage toattract most audience) and most diversified region search (eg. region with most diversefacilities).

Mapping; indexing and querying of MPEG-7 descriptors in RDBMS with IXMDB,Yang Chu; Liang-Tien Chia; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract MPEG-7 is a promising standard for the description of multimedia content. Anumber of applications based on MPEG-7 media descriptions have been set up forresearch; commercial and industrial applications. Therefore; an efficient storage solution forlarge amounts of MPEG-7 descriptions is certainly desirable. As a kind of data-centric XMLdocuments; MPEG-7 descriptions can be stored in the relational DBMS for efficient andeffective management. The approaches of storing XML data in relational DBMS can beclassified into two classes of storage model: schema-conscious and schema-oblivious. Theschema-conscious model; however; cannot support complex XPath-based queries efficientlyand the schema-oblivious approach lacks the flexibility in typed representation and access.Although the leading database systems have provided functionality for the XML document …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2007,9
Every Click You Make; IWill Be Fetching It: Efficient XML Query Processing in RDMS Using GUI-driven Prefetching,Sourav S Bhowmick; Sandeep Prakash,formulation and efficient processing of the formulated query. However; due to the nature ofXML data; formulating an XML query using an XML query language such as XQueryrequires considerable effort. A user must be completely familiar with the syntax of the querylanguage; and must be able to express his/her needs accurately in a syntactically correctform. In many real life applications it is not realistic to assume that users are proficient inexpressing such textual queries. Hence; there is a need for a user-friendly visual queryingschemes to replace data retrieval aspects of XQuery. In this paper; we address the problemof efficient processing of XQueries in the relational environment where the queries areformulated using a user-friendly GUI. We take a novel and non-traditional approach toimproving query performance by prefetching data during the formulation of a query in a …,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06.

Querying virtual hierarchies using virtual prefix-based numbers,Curtis E Dyreson; Sourav S Bhowmick; Ryan Grapp,Abstract Prefix-based numbering is a popular method for numbering nodes in a hierarchy.But prefix-based numbering breaks down when a node's location within a hierarchychanges; such as when XML data is queried after being transformed by an XSLT program orwhen data is reformatted in the return clause of an inner FLWR expression in a nestedXQuery program. A query on transformed data cannot be evaluated as efficiently since theextant prefix-based node numbers cannot be used (unless the data is materialized and thenrenumbered; which can be expensive). In this paper we present a novel strategy to virtuallytransform the data without instantiating and renumbering. Our method; which we call virtualprefix-based numbering; couples each prefix-based node number with a level array thatlocates the node in the numbering space of the virtual hierarchy. The virtual numbering …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2014,8
Efficient algorithms for generalized subgraph query processing,Wenqing Lin; Xiaokui Xiao; James Cheng; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract We study a new type of graph queries; which injectively maps its edges to paths ofthe graphs in a given database; where the length of each path is constrained by a giventhreshold specified by the weight of the corresponding matching edge. We give importantapplications of the new graph query and identify new challenges of processing such aquery. Then; we devise the cost model of the branch-and-bound algorithm framework forprocessing the graph query; and propose an efficient algorithm to minimize the costoverhead. We also develop three indexing techniques to efficiently answer the queriesonline. Finally; we verify the efficiency of our proposed indexes with extensive experimentson large real and synthetic datasets.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,8
Steady states and dynamics of urokinase-mediated plasmin activation in silico and in vitro,Lakshmi Venkatraman; Huipeng Li; C Forbes Dewey Jr; Jacob K White; Sourav S Bhowmick; Hanry Yu; Lisa Tucker-Kellogg,Abstract Plasmin (PLS) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (UPA) are ubiquitousproteases that regulate the extracellular environment. Although they are secreted in inactiveforms; they can activate each other through proteolytic cleavage. This mutual interplaycreates the potential for complex dynamics; which we investigated using mathematicalmodeling and in vitro experiments. We constructed ordinary differential equations to modelthe conversion of precursor plasminogen into active PLS; and precursor urokinase (scUPA)into active urokinase (tcUPA). Although neither PLS nor UPA exhibits allosteric cooperativity;modeling showed that cooperativity occurred at the system level because of substratecompetition. Computational simulations and bifurcation analysis predicted that the systemwould be bistable over a range of parameters for cooperativity and positive feedback. Cell …,Biophysical journal,2011,8

We present a novel HCI (human-computer interaction)-aware graph query processing paradigm; where instead of processinga query graph after its construction; it interleaves visual query construction and processing toimprove system response time. We demonstrate a system called GBLENDER that exploitsGUI latency to prune false results and prefetch candidate data graphs by employing a novelaction-aware indexing scheme and a data structure called spindle-shaped graphs (SPIG).We demonstrate various innovative features of GBLENDER and its promising performancein evaluating subgraph containment and similarity queries.,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,8
Affinity-driven prediction and ranking of products in online product review sites,Hui Li; Sourav S Bhowmick; Aixin Sun,Abstract Large online product review websites (eg; Epinions; Blippr) to various types ofproducts. Typically; each product in these sites is associated with a group of members whohave provided ratings and comments on it. These people form a product community. Apotential member can join a produce community by giving a new rating to the product. Werefer to this phenomenon of a product community's ability to" attract" new members asproduct affinity. The knowledge of a ranked list of products based on product affinity is ofmuch importance to be utilized for implementing policies; marketing research; onlineadvertisement; and other applications.

FASST mining: Discovering frequently changing semantic structure from versions of unordered XML documents,Qiankun Zhao; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract In this paper; we present a FASST mining approach to extract the frequentlychanging semantic structures (FASSTs); which are a subset of semantic substructures thatchange frequently; from versions of unordered XML documents. We propose a datastructure; H-DOM+; and a FASST mining algorithm; which incorporates the semantic issueand takes the advantage of the related domain knowledge. The distinct feature of thisapproach is that the FASST mining process is guided by the user-defined concept hierarchy.Rather than mining all the frequent changing structures; only these frequent changingstructures that are semantically meaningful are extracted. Our experimental results show thatthe H-DOM+ structure is compact and the FASST algorithm is efficient with good scalability.We also design a declarative FASST query language; FASSTQUEL; to make the FASST …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2005,8
Looking at mapping; indexing & querying of MPEG-7 descriptors in RDBMS with SM3,Yang Chu; Liang-Tien Chia; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract MPEG-7 documents; which are primarily for multimedia information exchange; arealso data-centric XML documents. Due to its advantages; the relational DBMS is the bestchoice for storing such XML documents. Storing XML data in relational DBMS can beclassified into two classes of storage model: structure-mapping and model-mapping.However; the structure-mapping model cannot support complex Xpath-based queryefficiently and model mapping approach lacks the flexible capability in representing all kindsof datatypes. In this paper; we present a new storage approach; called SM3. As an XMLdocument; MPEG-7 document can be viewed as XML tree. Such a tree graph; where theinternal nodes are element type with element contents; represents the structure of documentand can be viewed as nodes which are meaningful only for document traversal.

Cost-benefit analysis of web bag in a web warehouse: An analytical approach,Sourav S Bhowmick; Sanjay Madria; Wee-Keong Ng; Ee-Peng Lim,Abstract Sets and bags are closely related structures and have been studied in relationaldatabases. A bag is different from a set in that it is sensitive to the number of times anelement occurs while a set is not. In this paper; we introduce the concept of web bag in thecontext of a web warehouse called Whoweda (W are house O f W eda D ata) which we arecurrently building. Informally; a web bag is a web table which allows multiple occurrences ofidentical web tuples. Web bag helps to discover useful knowledge from a web table such asvisible documents (or web sites); luminous documents and luminous paths.

The past is not a foreign country: Detecting semantically similar terms across time,Yating Zhang; Adam Jatowt; Sourav S Bhowmick; Katsumi Tanaka,Numerous archives and collections of past documents have become available recentlythanks to mass scale digitization and preservation efforts. Libraries; national archives; andother memory institutions have started opening up their collections to interested users. Yet;searching within such collections usually requires knowledge of appropriate keywords dueto different context and language of the past. Thus; non-professional users may havedifficulties with conceptualizing suitable queries; as; typically; their knowledge of the past islimited. In this paper; we propose a novel approach for the temporal correspondencedetection task that requires finding terms in the past which are semantically closest to agiven input present term.

PIGEON: Progress indicator for subgraph queries,Xiaojing Xie; Zhe Fan; Byron Choi; Peipei Yi; Sourav S Bhowmick; Shuigeng Zhou,Subgraph queries have been a fundamental query for retrieving patterns from graph data.Due to the well known NP hardness of subgraph queries; those queries may sometimes takea long time to complete. Our recent investigation on real-world datasets revealed that theperformance of queries on graphs generally varies greatly. In other words; query clients mayoccasionally encounter “unexpectedly” long execution from a subgraph query processor.This paper aims to demonstrate a tool that alleviates the problem by monitoring subgraphquery progress. Specifically; we present a novel subgraph query progress indicator calledPIGEON that exploits query-time information to report to users accurate estimated queryprogress. In the demonstration; users may interact with PIGEON to gain insights on the queryevaluation; which include the following: Users are enabled to (i) monitor query progress; …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,6
Asymmetric structure-preserving subgraph queries for large graphs,Zhe Fan; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Sourav S Bhowmick,One fundamental type of query for graph databases is subgraph isomorphism queries (akasubgraph queries). Due to the computational hardness of subgraph queries coupled with thecost of managing massive graph data; outsourcing the query computation to a third-partyservice provider has been an economical and scalable approach. However; confidentiality isknown to be an important attribute of Quality of Service (QoS) in Query as a Service (QaaS).In this paper; we propose the first practical private approach for subgraph query services;asymmetric structure-preserving subgraph query processing; where the data graph ispublicly known and the query structure/topology is kept secret. Unlike other previousmethods for subgraph queries; this paper proposes a series of novel optimizations that onlyexploit graph structures; not the queries.

DB⋈ HCI: towards bridging the chasm between graph data management and HCI,Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Visual query interfaces enable users to construct queries without special training inthe syntax and semantics of a query language. Traditionally; efforts toward such interfacedesign and devising efficient query processing techniques are independent to each other.This is primarily due to the chasm between hci and data management fields as since theirinception; rarely any systematic effort is made to leverage techniques and principles fromeach other for superior user experience. In this paper; we lay down the vision of bridging thischasm in the context of visual graph query formulation and processing. Specifically; wepresent the architecture and novel research challenges of a framework for querying graphdata visually where the visual interface management is data-driven and query processingand performance benchmarking are hci-driven.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2014,6
CASIS: a system for concept-aware social image search,Ba Quan Truong; Aixin Sun; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Tag-based social image search enables users to formulate queries using keywords.However; as queries are usually very short and users have very different interpretations of aparticular tag in annotating and searching images; the returned images to a tag queryusually contain a collection of images related to multiple concepts. We demonstrate Casis; asystem for concept-aware social image search. Casis detects tag concepts based on thecollective knowledge embedded in social tagging from the initial results to a query. A tagconcept is a set of tags highly associated with each other and collectively conveys asemantic meaning. Images to a query are then organized by tag concepts.

Optimizing incremental maintenance of minimal bisimulation of cyclic graphs,Jintian Deng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Graph-structured databases have numerous recent applications including theSemantic Web; biological databases and XML; among many others. In this paper; we studythe maintenance problem of a popular structural index; namely bisimulation; of a possiblycyclic data graph. In comparison; previous work mainly focuses on acyclic graphs. In thecontext of database applications; it is natural to compute minimal bisimulation with mergingalgorithms. First; we propose a maintenance algorithm for a minimal bisimulation of a cyclicgraph; in the style of merging. Second; to prune the computation on non-bisimilar SCC s; wepropose a feature-based optimization. The features are designed to be constructed andused more efficiently than bisimulation minimization. Third; we conduct an experimentalstudy that verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.

Efficient evaluation of NOT-twig queries in tree-unaware relational databases,Kheng Hong Soh; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Despite a large body of work on xml query processing in relational environment;systematic study of not-twig queries has received little attention in the literature. Suchqueries contain not-predicates and are useful for many real-world applications. In this paper;we present an efficient strategy to evaluate not-twig queries on top of a dewey-based tree-unaware system called Sucxent++ [11]. We extend the encoding scheme of Sucxent++ byadding two new labels; namely AncestorValue and AncestorDeweyGroup; that enable us todirectly filter out elements satisfying a not-predicate by comparing their ancestor groupidentifiers. In this approach; a set of elements under the same common ancestor at a specificlevel in the xml tree is assigned same ancestor group identifier. Based on this encodingscheme; we propose a novel sql translation algorithm for not-twig query evaluation. Real …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2011,6
Mining conserved XML query paths for dynamic-conscious caching,Qiankun Zhao; Sourav S Bhowmick; Le Gruenwald,Abstract Existing XML query pattern-based caching strategies focus on extracting the set offrequently issued query pattern trees based on the number of occurrences of the querypattern trees in the history. Each occurrence of the same query pattern tree is consideredequally important for the caching strategy. However; the same query pattern tree may occurat different timepoints in the history of XML queries. This temporal feature can be used toimprove the caching strategy. In this paper; we propose a novel type of query pattern calledconserved query paths for efficient caching by integrating the support and temporal featurestogether. Conserved query paths are paths in query pattern trees that never change or donot change significantly most of the time (if not always) in terms of their support valuesduring a specific time period. We proposed an algorithm to extract those conserved query …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2005,6
Event composition and detection in data stream management systems,Mukesh Mohania; Dhruv Swamini; Shyam Kumar Gupta; Sourav Bhowmick; Tharam Dillon,Abstract There has been a rising need to handle and process streaming kind of data. It iscontinuous; unpredictable; time-varying in nature and could arrive in multiple rapid streams.Sensor data; web clickstreams; etc. are the examples of streaming data. One of the importantissues about streaming data management systems is that it needs to be processed in real-time. That is; active rules can be defined over data streams for making the system reactive.These rules are triggered based on the events detected on the data stream; or eventsdetected while summarizing the data or combination of both. In this paper; we study thechallenges involved in monitoring events in a Data Stream Management System (DSMS)and how they differ from the same in active databases. We propose an architecture for eventcomposition and detection in a DSMS; and then discuss an algorithm for detecting …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2005,6
SM3+: an XML database solution for the management of MPEG-7 descriptions,Yang Chu; Liang-Tien Chia; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract MPEG-7 is a promising standard for the description of multimedia content. A lot ofapplications based on MPEG-7 media descriptions have been set up. Therefore; an efficientstorage solution for large amounts of MPEG-7 descriptions are certainly desirable. MPEG-7documents are also data-centric XML documents. Due to many advantages; the relationalDBMS is the best choice for storing such XML documents. However; the existing RDBMS-based XML storage solutions can not reach all the critical requirements for MPEG-7descriptions management. In this paper; we analyse the problems when using existingRDBMS-based XML storage approaches to store MPEG-7 documents and then present anew storage approach; called SM3+ that integrates the advantages of existing XML storagemodels and avoid the main drawbacks from them. Its features can reach the most critical …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2005,6
HW-STALKER: A machine learning-based system for transforming QURE-Pagelets to XML,Vladimir Kovalev; Sourav S Bhowmick; Sanjay Madria,Abstract In this paper; we address the problem of extracting and transforming dynamicallygenerated hyperlinked hidden web query results to XML. Our approach is based on thestalker approach. As stalker was designed to extract data from a single web page; it cannothandle a set of hyperlinked pages. We propose an algorithm called HW-Transform fortransforming hidden web query results (also called QURE-Pagelets) to XML format usingmachine learning by extending stalker to handle hyperlinked hidden web pages. One of thekey features of our approach is that we identify and transform key attributes of query resultsinto XML attributes. These key attributes facilitate applications such as change detection anddata integration by efficiently identifying related or identical results. Based on the proposedalgorithm; we have implemented a prototype system called hw-stalker using Java. Our …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2005,6
AXIS: A XML schema integration system,Bipin Sakamuri; Sanjay Madria; Kalpdrum Passi; Eric Chaudhry; Mukesh Mohania; S Bhowmick,Abstract The availability of large amounts of heterogeneous distributed web datanecessitates the integration and querying of XML data from multiple XML sources for manyreasons. For example; currently many government agencies in US such as IRS; INS; FBI;CIA are integrating their system to deal with new security threats; and these differentdepartments uses legacy database systems including relational data; flat files;spreadsheets; and html pages; and simple text data. Similarly; there are many e-commercecompanies; which sell similar products but represent data using different XML schemas.When any two such companies merge; or make an effort to service customers incooperation; there is a need for a uniform schema integration methodology [1; 2]. In someapplications like comparison-shopping; there is a need for an illusionary centralized …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2003,6
Constraint-driven join processing in a Web Warehouse,Sourav S Bhowmick; Wee Keong Ng; Sanjay Madria,Abstract There has been considerable research in join operation in relational databases. Inthis paper; we introduce the concept of web join for combining hyperlinked Web data. Webjoin is one of the web algebraic operator in our web warehousing system called W howeda(WareHouse Of WEb DAta). Similar to its relational counterpart; it can be used to gatheruseful; composite information from two web tables. The significance of web join perhaps canbe best realized when we wish to combine data from a Web site where some of theinformation in the Web site is no longer available due to changes to the site. A web joinoperation can be constraint-free or constraint-driven depending on the absence or presenceof join conditions. In this paper; we focus our discussion on constraint-driven web joinoperation; ie; web join operation in the presence of user-specified join conditions …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2003,6
XomatiQ: living with genomes; proteomes; relations and a little bit of XML,Sourav S Bhowmick; Pedro Cruz; Amey Laud,Abstract In this paper; we describe a system called XomatiQ to address the problem ofintegration; querying and correlation of biological data. XomatiQ is an integral part of thegenomics Research Network Architecture (gRNA). The gRNA provides the developmentenvironment in which new applications can be quickly written; and the deploymentenvironment in which they can systematically avail of computing resources and integrateinformation from distributed biological data sources. Specifically; XomatiQ is build on top ofthe Data Hounds component. The Data Hounds transforms data from various sources toXML format and loads them into tuples of relational tables in a standard commercial DBMS.The XomatiQ provides capability for querying XML data using the underlying relationalengine. XomatiQ has been fully implemented using Java.,PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA ENGINEERING,2003,6
Constraint-free join processing on hyperlinked web data,Sourav S Bhowmick; Wee Keong Ng; Sanjay Madria; Mukesh Mohania,Abstract In this paper; we introduce the concept of web join for combining hyperlinked Webdata. A web join is one of the web algebraic operator in our web warehousing system calledWhoweda (W are H ouse O f WE b DA ta). It can be used to gather useful; compositeinformation from two web tables.

Schemas for web data: a reverse engineering approach,Sourav S Bhowmick; Wee Keong Ng; Sanjay Madria,Abstract In this paper; we show how to generate schemas of a set of HTML or XMLdocuments retrieved from the web in the context of our web warehousing system called Whoweda (WareHouse Of WEb DAta). Web schemas are used to bind a web table thatcontains a collection of interlinked web documents called web tuples. These schemasspecify the metadata; content and structural properties (in the form of predicates) shared bythe web documents and hyperlinks in the web table. They also summarize the hyperlinkstructure of these documents using the notion of connectivities. Web schemas are generatedin three stages. In the first stage; a simple or complex web schema is generated from theuser's query (coupling query). In the next stage; the complex web schema is decomposedinto a set of simple web schemas. These two stages are performed without inspecting the …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2001,6
Imposing disjunctive constraints on inter-document structure,Sourav S Bhowmick; Wee Keong Ng; Sanjay Madria,Abstract Most of the contemporary web query systems has limited capabilities in imposingdisjunctive constraints on the hyperlinked structure of Web documents. Such query facility isimportant because it gives us an opportunity to overcome the irregular and semistructurednature of the inter-document structure in the Web. In this paper; we describe a querymechanism called coupling query to address this issue in the context of our webwarehousing system called W HOWEDA (W are h ouse O f We b Da ta). We describe thesyntax and semantics of the connectivities in a coupling query which enables us to imposedisjunctive constraints on the inter-document structure. We describe two flavours of couplingquery; ie; canonical and non-canonical; and show how a non-canonical query can betransformed to a valid canonical query. Such transformation is useful for query evaluation.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2001,6

Computational cell fate modelling for discovery of rewiring in apoptotic network for enhanced cancer drug sensitivity,Shital K Mishra; Sourav S Bhowmick; Huey Eng Chua; Fan Zhang; Jie Zheng,The ongoing cancer research has shown that malignant tumour cells have highly disruptedsignalling transduction pathways. In cancer cells; signalling pathways are altered to satisfythe demands of continuous proliferation and survival. The changes in signalling pathwayssupporting uncontrolled cell growth; termed as rewiring; can lead to dysregulation of cellfates eg apoptosis. Hence comparative analysis of normal and oncogenic signaltransduction pathways may provide insights into mechanisms of cancer drug-resistance andfacilitate the discovery of novel and effective anti-cancer therapies. Here we propose ahybrid modelling approach based on ordinary differential equation (ODE) and machinelearning to map network rewiring in the apoptotic pathways that may be responsible for theincrease of drug sensitivity of tumour cells in triple-negative breast cancer. Our method …,BMC systems biology,2015,5
Structure-preserving subgraph query services,Zhe Fan; Byron Choi; Qian Chen; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu; Sourav S Bhowmick,A fundamental problem of graph databases is subgraph isomorphism query (aka subgraphquery): given a query graph Q and a graph database; it retrieves the graphs Gs from thedatabase that contain Q. Due to the cost of managing massive data coupled with thecomputational hardness of subgraph isomorphism testing; outsourcing the computations to athird-party provider is an appealing alternative. However; confidentiality has been a criticalattribute of quality of service (QoS) in query services. To the best of our knowledge;subgraph query services with tunable preservation of privacy of structural information havenever been addressed. In this paper; we present the first work on structure-preservingsubIso (SPsubIso). A crucial step of our work is to transform subIso-the seminal subgraphisomorphism algorithm (the Ullmann's algorithm)-into a series of matrix operations.

TENET: topological feature-based target characterization in signalling networks,Huey Eng Chua; Sourav S Bhowmick; Lisa Tucker-Kellogg; C Forbes Dewey Jr,Abstract Motivation: Target characterization for a biochemical network is a heuristicevaluation process that produces a characterization model that may aid in predicting thesuitability of each molecule for drug targeting. These approaches are typically used in drugresearch to identify novel potential targets using insights from known targets. Traditionalapproaches that characterize targets based on their molecular characteristics and biologicalfunction require extensive experimental study of each protein and are infeasible forevaluating larger networks with poorly understood proteins. Moreover; they fail to exploitnetwork connectivity information which is now available from systems biology methods.Adopting a network-based approach by characterizing targets using network featuresprovides greater insights that complement these traditional techniques. To this end; we …,Bioinformatics,2015,5
ViSual: An hci-inspired simulator for blending visual subgraph query construction and processing,Sourav S Bhowmick; Huey Eng Chua; Benji Thian; Byron Choi,In [3]; we laid out the vision of a novel graph query processing paradigm; where visualsubgraph query formulation is interleaved (or “blended”) with query processing by exploitingthe latency offered by the gui. Our recent attempts at implementing this vision [6];[7] do notprovide any robust framework to systematically investigate the performance of this novelparadigm. This is because it is prohibitively expensive to engage a large number of users toformulate a large number of visual queries in order to measure the performance of blendingquery formulation with query processing. In this demonstration; we present a novel syntheticvisual subgraph query simulator called ViSual that can evaluate the performance of thisparadigm for a large number of visual subgraph queries without requiring a large number ofusers to formulate them. Specifically; it leverages principles from hci to quantify the gui …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,5
ANDES: efficient evaluation of NOT-twig queries in relational databases,Kheng Hong Soh; Ba Quan Truong; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Despite a large body of work on XPath query processing in relational environment;systematic study of queries containing not-predicates have received little attention in theliterature. Particularly; several xml supports of industrial-strength commercial rdbms fail toefficiently evaluate such queries. In this paper; we present an efficient and novel strategy toevaluate not-twig queries in a tree-unaware relational environment. not-twig queries areXPath queries with ancestor–descendant and parent–child axis and contain one or more not-predicates. We propose a novel Dewey-based encoding scheme called Andes (AN cestor Dewey-based E ncoding S cheme); which enables us to efficiently filter out elementssatisfying a not-predicate by comparing their ancestor group identifiers. In this approach; aset of elements under the same common ancestor at a specific level in the xml tree is …,The VLDB Journal,2012,5
SINBAD: towards structure-independent querying of common neighbors in XML databases,Ba Quan Truong; Sourav S Bhowmick; Curtis Dyreson,Abstract xml query languages use directional path expressions to locate data in an xml datacollection. They are tightly coupled to the structure of a data collection; and can fail whenevaluated on the same data in a different structure. This paper extends XPath expressionswith a new structure-independent; non-directional axis called the neighborhood axis. Givena pair of context nodes; the neighborhood axis returns those nodes that are commonneighbors of the context nodes in any direction. Such axis finds its usefulness in structure-independent query formulation as well as supporting relevant results computation in design-independent xml keyword search. We propose an algorithm called sinbad that exploits thenovel notion of node locality and small size of xml structure tree to efficiently determine thecommon neighbors of the context nodes. Our empirical study demonstrates that sinbad …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2012,5
Quantifying visual-representativeness of social image tags using image tag clarity,Aixin Sun; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Tags associated with images in various social media sharing web sites arevaluable information source for superior image retrieval experiences. Due to the nature oftagging; many tags associated with images are not visually descriptive. In this chapter; wepropose Image Tag Clarity to evaluate the effectiveness of a tag in describing the visualcontent of its annotated images; which is also known as the image tag visual-representativeness. It is measured by computing the zero-mean normalized distancebetween the tag language model estimated from the images annotated by the tag and thecollection language model. The tag/collection language models are derived from the bag ofvisual-word local content features of the images. The visual-representative tags that arecommonly used to annotate visually similar images are given high tag clarity scores …,*,2011,5
Cleopatra: evolutionary pattern-based clustering of web usage data,Qiankun Zhao; Sourav S Bhowmick; Le Gruenwald,Abstract Existing web usage mining techniques focus only on discovering knowledge basedon the statistical measures obtained from the static characteristics of web usage data. Theydo not consider the dynamic nature of web usage data. In this paper; we present analgorithm called Cleopatra (CL ustering of E v O lutionary PA t T e R n-based web A ccesssequences) to cluster web access sequences (WAS)s based on their evolutionary patterns.In this approach; Web access sequences that have similar change patterns in their supportcounts in the history are grouped into the same cluster. The intuition is that often WASs areevent/task-driven. As a result; WASs related to the same event/task are expected to beaccessed in similar ways over time. Such clusters are useful for several applications such asintelligent web site maintenance and personalized web services.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2006,5
VACXENE: a user-friendly visual synthetic XML generator,Khoo Boon Tian; Sourav S Bhowmick; Sanjay Madria,Abstract Synthetic collections of valid XML documents are useful in many XML applications.However; creating test cases for XML applications by manually from DTDs can be tediousand may not cover all possible or required instances. In this paper; we present VACXENE(VisuAl synthetiC Xml gENErator); a Java-based tool that creates test cases for XMLapplications by generating random instances of valid XML documents from a single DTD.XML generator provides a user-friendly GUI that allows us to control the appearance of theXML output by imposing user-defined constraints.

Data management in metaboloinformatics: issues and challenges,Sourav S Bhowmick; Dadabhai T Singh; Amey Laud,Abstract Metaboloinformatics can be considered as derivation of knowledge from computeranalysis of metabolomite resources. Metabolomics is the systematic analysis of thousands ofnon peptide small compounds such as sugars; fatty acids; vitamins etc. at the cellular andtissue level of a living organism. Using metabolomic technologies; researchers are able tosystematically determine metabolite concentration in a sample. These developingtechnologies have the potential of being applied in the areas of drug discovery anddevelopment and preventive screening/diagnostics. In this paper; we identify the issues andchallenges in metaboloinformatic data management. We also discuss how the gRNA can beused to address some the challenges in this field.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2003,5

In a data warehouse specially designed for web information;web information coupling provides the means to derive useful information from the WWW.Web information is materialized in the form of web tuples and stored in web tables. In thispaper; we discuss web data visualization operators such as web nest; web unnest; webcoalesce; web expand; web pack; web unpack and web sort in the context of our webwarehousing system called Whoweda (W are h ouse of We b Da ta) to provide users with theflexibility to view sets of web documents in perspectives which may be more meaningful.,The Computer Journal,2000,5
Cost-benefit analysis of Web bag in a Web warehouse,Sourav S Bhowmick; Sanjay Madria; Wee-Kong Ng; Ee-Peng Lim,Sets and bags are closely related structures and have been studied in relational databases.A bag is different from a set in that it is sensitive to the number of times an element occurs;while a set is not. In this paper; we introduce the concept of a Web bag in the context of aWorld Wide Web warehouse called WHOWEDA (WareHouse Of WEb DAta) which we arecurrently building. Informally; a Web bag is a Web table which allows multiple occurrences ofidentical Web types. A Web bag helps one to discover useful knowledge from a Web table;such as visible documents or Web sites (ie documents/sites which can be reached by manypaths); luminous documents (ie documents with many outgoing links) and luminous paths(ie frequently traversed paths). In this paper; we provide a cost-benefit analysis ofmaterializing Web bags as compared to Web tables with distinct Web tuples.,Database Engineering and Applications; 1999. IDEAS'99.

DUALSIM: Parallel subgraph enumeration in a massive graph on a single machine,Hyeonji Kim; Juneyoung Lee; Sourav S Bhowmick; Wook-Shin Han; JeongHoon Lee; Seongyun Ko; Moath HA Jarrah,Abstract Subgraph enumeration is important for many applications such as subgraphfrequencies; network motif discovery; graphlet kernel computation; and studying theevolution of social networks. Most earlier work on subgraph enumeration assumes thatgraphs are resident in memory; which results in serious scalability problems. Recently;efforts to enumerate all subgraphs in a large-scale graph have seemed to enjoy somesuccess by partitioning the data graph and exploiting the distributed frameworks such asMapReduce and distributed graph engines. However; we notice that all existing distributedapproaches have serious performance problems for subgraph enumeration due to theexplosive number of partial results. In this paper; we design and implement a disk-based;single machine parallel subgraph enumeration solution called DualSim that can handle …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,4
Interruption-sensitive empty result feedback: Rethinking the visual query feedback paradigm for semistructured data,Sourav S Bhowmick; Curtis Dyreson; Byron Choi; Min-Hwee Ang,Abstract The usability of visual querying schemes for tree and graph-structured data can begreatly enhanced by providing feedback during query construction; but feedback atinopportune times can hamper query construction. In this paper; we rethink the traditionalway of providing feedback. We describe a novel vision of interruption-sensitive queryfeedback where relevant notifications are delivered quickly but at an appropriate momentwhen the mental workload of the user is low. Though we focus on one class of queryfeedback; namely empty result detection; where a user is notified when a partiallyconstructed visual query yields an empty result; our new paradigm is applicable to otherkinds of feedback. We present a framework called iSERF that bridges the classical databaseproblem of empty-result detection with intelligent notification management from the …,Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2015,4
DaVinci: Data-driven visual interface construction for subgraph search in graph databases,Jinbo Zhang; Sourav S Bhowmick; Hong H Nguyen; Byron Choi; Feida Zhu,Due to the complexity of graph query languages; the need for visual query interfaces thatcan reduce the burden of query formulation is fundamental to the spreading of graph datamanagement tools to a wider community. Despite the significant progress towards buildingsuch query interfaces to simplify visual subgraph query formulation task; construction ofcurrent generation visual interfaces is not data-driven. That is; it does not exploit theunderlying data graphs to automatically generate the contents of various panels in theinterface. Such data-driven construction has several benefits such as superior support forsubgraph query formulation and portability of the interface across different graph databases.In this demonstration; we present a novel data-driven visual subgraph query interfaceconstruction engine called DaVinci.

Diffnet: Automatic differential functional summarization of de-map networks,Boon-Siew Seah; Sourav S Bhowmick; C Forbes Dewey Jr,Abstract The study of genetic interaction networks that respond to changing conditions is anemerging research problem. Recently; Bandyopadhyay et al.(2010) proposed a technique toconstruct a differential network (dE-MAP network) from two static gene interaction networksin order to map the interaction differences between them under environment or conditionchange (eg; DNA-damaging agent). This differential network is then manually analyzed toconclude that DNA repair is differentially effected by the condition change. Unfortunately;manual construction of differential functional summary from a dE-MAP network thatsummarizes all pertinent functional responses is time-consuming; laborious and error-prone;impeding large-scale analysis on it. To this end; we propose DiffNet; a novel data-drivenalgorithm that leverages Gene Ontology (go) annotations to automatically summarize a …,Methods,2014,4
FACETS: multi-faceted functional decomposition of protein interaction networks,Boon-Siew Seah; Sourav S Bhowmick; C Forbes Dewey Jr,Abstract Motivation: The availability of large-scale curated protein interaction datasets hasgiven rise to the opportunity to investigate higher level organization and modularity withinthe protein–protein interaction (PPI) network using graph theoretic analysis. Despite therecent progress; systems level analysis of high-throughput PPIs remains a daunting taskbecause of the amount of data they present. In this article; we propose a novel PPI networkdecomposition algorithm called FACETS in order to make sense of the deluge of interactiondata using Gene Ontology (GO) annotations. FACETS finds not just a single functionaldecomposition of the PPI network; but a multi-faceted atlas of functional decompositions thatportray alternative perspectives of the functional landscape of the underlying PPI network.Each facet in the atlas represents a distinct interpretation of how the network can be …,Bioinformatics,2012,4
Integrating historical noisy answers for improving data utility under differential privacy,Shixi Chen; Shuigeng Zhou; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Differential privacy is a robust principle for privacy preserving data analysis tasks;and has been successfully applied to a variety of applications. However; the number ofqueries that can be answered is limited for preventing privacy disclosure. Once the privacybudget is exhausted; all succeeding queries must be rejected. Therefore; each of thehistorical query answers is valuable and it is important to exploit them together to learn moreabout the data. We propose to integrate all available linear query answers into a consistentform that embodies our knowledge learned from the noisy answers; obtaining more accurateanswers to past queries and even new queries; improving the data utility. Two distinctapproaches are developed for this purpose; one via principle component analysis; andanother via maximum entropy method. The second approach also generates a synthetic …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2012,4
Efficient maintenance of common keys in archives of continuous query results from deep websites,Fajar Ardian; Sourav S Bhowmick,In many real-world applications; it is important to create a local archive containing versionsof structured results of continuous queries (queries that are evaluated periodically)submitted to autonomous database-driven Web sites (eg; deep Web). Such history of digitalinformation is a potential gold mine for all kinds of scientific; media and business analysts.An important task in this context is to maintain the set of common keys of the underlyingarchived results as they play pivotal role in data modeling and analysis; query processing;and entity tracking. A set of attributes in a structured data is a common key iff it is a key for allversions of the data in the archive. Due to the data-driven nature of key discovery from thearchive; unlike traditional keys; the common keys are not temporally invariant. That is; keysidentified in one version may be different from those in another version. Hence; in this …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,4
Efficient database-driven evaluation of security clearance for federated access control of dynamic XML documents,Erwin Leonardi; Sourav S Bhowmick; Mizuho Iwaihara,Abstract Achieving data security over cooperating web services is becoming a reality; butexisting xml access control architectures do not consider this federated service computing. Inthis paper; we consider a federated access control model; in which Data Provider and PolicyEnforcers are separated into different organizations; the Data Provider is responsible forevaluating criticality of requested xml documents based on co-occurrence of securityobjects; and issuing security clearances. The Policy Enforcers enforce access control rulesreflecting their organization-specific policies. A user's query is sent to the Data Provider andshe needs to obtain a permission from the Policy Enforcer in her organization to read theresults of her query. The Data Provider evaluates the query and also evaluate criticality ofthe query; where evaluation of sensitiveness is carried out by using clearance rules.

Towards non-directional Xpath evaluation in a RDBMS,Sourav S Bhowmick; Curtis Dyreson; Erwin Leonardi; Zhifeng Ng,Abstract XML query languages use directional path expressions to locate data in an XMLdata collection. They are tightly coupled to the structure of a data collection; and can failwhen evaluated on the same data in a different structure. This paper extends pathexpressions with a new non-directional axis called the rank-distance axis. Given a contextnode and two positive integers α and β; the rank-distance axis returns those nodes that areranked between α and β in terms of closeness from the context node in any direction. Thispaper shows how to evaluate the rank-distance axis in a tree-unaware XML database. A tree-unaware implementation does not invade the database kernel to support XML queries;instead it uses an existing RDBMS such as Microsoft's SQL server as a back-end andprovides a front-end layer to translate XML queries to SQL.

In the search of nectars from evolutionary trees,Ling Chen; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Mining trees is very useful in domains like bioinformatics; web mining; mining semi-structured data; and so on. These efforts largely assumed that the trees are static. However;in many real applications; tree data are evolutionary in nature. In this paper; we focus onmining evolution patterns from historical tree-structured data. Specifically; we propose anovel approach to discover negatively correlated subtree patterns (nectar s) from asequence of historical versions of unordered trees. The objective is to extract subtrees thatare negatively correlated in undergoing structural changes. We propose an algorithm callednectar-Miner based on a set of evolution metrics to extract nectar s. nectar s can be useful inseveral applications such as maintaining mirrors of a website and maintaining xml pathselectivity estimation. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm has good …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2009,4
Oxone: a scalable solution for detecting superior quality deltas on ordered large XML documents,Erwin Leonardi; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Recently; a number of relational-based approaches for detecting the changes toXML data have been proposed to address the scalability problem of main memory-basedapproaches (eg; X-Diff; XyDiff). These approaches store the XML documents in the relationaldatabase and issue SQL queries (whenever appropriate) to detect the changes. In thispaper; we propose a relational-based ordered XML change detection technique (calledOxone) that uses a schema-conscious approach as the underlying storage strategy for XMLdata. Previous efforts have focused on detecting changes to ordered XML in an schema-oblivious storage environment. Although the schema-oblivious approach produces betterresult quality compared to XyDiff (a main memory-based ordered XML change detectionapproach); its performance degrade with increase in data size and is slower than XyDiff …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2006,4
Formulating disjunctive coupling queries in a web warehouse,Sourav S Bhowmick; Ang Kho Kiong; Sanjay Madria,Abstract We describe how to formulate a coupling query to glean relevant Web data in thecontext of our web warehousing system called W howeda (Warehouse Of Web Data).Coupling query may be used for querying both HTML and XML documents. One of theimportant feature of our query mechanism is the ability to express conjunctive as well asdisjunctive query conditions compactly. We describe how to formulate a coupling query intext form as well as pictorially using the coupling text and the coupling graph respectively.We explore the limitations of coupling graph with respect to the coupling text. We found outthat AND-; OR-and AND/OR-coupling graphs are less expressive than their textualcounterparts. To address this shortcoming we introduce the notion of hybrid graph which is aspecial type of p-connected coupling graph.

In this paper; weintroduce the concept of web bag in the context of the web warehouse project called Whoweda (Warehouse of Web Data). Informally; a web bag is a web table which allowsmultiple occurrences of identical web tuples. We have used web bag to discover usefulknowledge from a web table such as visible documents (or web sites); luminous documentsand luminous paths.

Deriving and verifying statistical distribution of a hyperlink-based Web page quality metric,Devanshu Dhyani; Sourav S Bhowmick; Wee Keong Ng,Abstract In this paper; we discuss issues related to metrics for Web page quality. Thesemetrics are used for ranking the quality and relevance of Web pages in response to userneeds. We focus on the problem of ascertaining the statistical distribution of some well-known hyperlink basedWebpage quality metrics. Based on empirical distributionsofWebpage degrees; we derived analytically the probability distribution for the Pagerankmetric. We found out that it follows the familiar inverse polynomial lawrep orted for Webpagedegrees. We verified the theoretical exercise with experimental results that suggest a highlyconcentrated distribution of the metric.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2002,4
On formulation of disjunctive coupling queries in Whoweda,Sourav S Bhowmick; Wee Keong Ng; Sanjay Madria,Abstract We describe how to formulate coupling query to glean relevant Web data in thecontext of our web warehousing system called W HOWEDA (W are h ouse O f We b Da ta).One of the important feature of our query mechanism is the ability to express disjunctivequery conditions compactly. We describe how to formulate coupling queries in text form aswell as pictorially using coupling text and coupling graph. We explore the limitations ofcoupling graph with respect to coupling text. We found out that AND; OR and AND/OR-coupling graphs are less expressive than their textual counterparts. To address thisshortcoming we introduced another query formulation technique called hybrid graph whichis a special type of p-connected coupling graph.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2001,4

AutoG: A visual query autocompletion framework for graph databases,Peipei Yi; Byron Choi; Sourav S Bhowmick; Jianliang Xu,Abstract Composing queries is evidently a tedious task. This is particularly true of graphqueries as they are typically complex and prone to errors; compounded by the fact thatgraph schemas can be missing or too loose to be helpful for query formulation. Despite thegreat success of query formulation aids; in particular; automatic query completion; graphquery autocompletion has received much less research attention. In this demonstration; wepresent a novel interactive visual subgraph query autocompletion framework called A uto Gwhich alleviates the potentially painstaking task of graph query formulation. Specifically;given a large collection of small or medium-sized graphs and a visual query fragment qformulated by a user; A uto G returns top-k query suggestions Q′ as output at interactivetime. Users may choose a query from Q′ and iteratively apply A uto G to compose their …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,3
Summarizing social image search results,Boon-Siew Seah; Sourav S Bhowmick; Aixin Sun,Abstract Most existing social image search engines present search results as a ranked list ofimages; which cannot be consumed by users in a natural and intuitive manner. Here; wepresent a novel algorithm that exploits both visual features and tags of the search results togenerate high quality image search result summary. The summary not only breaks theresults into visually and semantically coherent clusters; but it also maximizes the coverage ofthe original search results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method against state-of-the-art image summarization and clustering algorithms.,Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on World Wide Web,2014,3
Affinity-driven blog cascade analysis and prediction,Hui Li; Sourav S Bhowmick; Aixin Sun; Jiangtao Cui,Abstract Information propagation within the blogosphere is of much importance inimplementing policies; marketing research; launching new products; and other applications.In this paper; we take a microscopic view of the information propagation pattern inblogosphere by investigating blog cascade affinity. A blog cascade is a group of posts linkedtogether discussing about the same topic; and cascade affinity refers to the phenomenon ofa blog's inclination to join a specific cascade. We identify and analyze an array ofmacroscopic and microscopic content-oblivious features that may affect a blogger's cascadejoining behavior and utilize these features to predict cascade affinity of blogs. Based onthese features; we present two non-probabilistic and probabilistic strategies; namely supportvector machine (SVM) classification-based approach and Bipartite Markov Random Field …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2014,3
Mustblend: Blending visual multi-source twig query formulation and query processing in rdbms,Ba Quan Truong; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Recently; in [3; 9] a novel xml query processing paradigm was proposed; whereinstead of processing a visual xml query after its construction; it interleaves queryformulation and processing by exploiting the latency offered by the gui to filter irrelevantmatches and prefetch partial query results. A key benefit of this paradigm is significantimprovement of the user waiting time (uwt); which refers to the duration between the time auser presses the “Run” icon to the time when the user gets the query results. However; thecurrent state-of-the-art approach that realizes this paradigm suffers from key limitations suchas inability to correctly evaluate certain visual query conditions together when necessary;large intermediate results space; and inability to handle visual query modifications; limitingits usage in practical environment. In this paper; we present a rdbms-based single as well …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2013,3
Querying XML data: as you shape it,Curtis E Dyreson; Sourav S Bhowmick,A limitation of XQuery is that a programmer has to be familiar with the shape of the data toquery it effectively. And if that shape changes; or if the shape is other than what theprogrammer expects; the query may fail. One way to avoid this limitation is to transform thedata into a desired shape. A data transformation is a rearrangement of data into a newshape. In this paper; we present the semantics and implementation of XMorph 2.0; a shape-polymorphic data transformation language for XML. An XMorph program can act as a queryguard. The guard both transforms data to the shape needed by the query and determineswhether and how the transformation potentially loses information; a transformation that losesinformation may lead to a query yielding an inaccurate result. This paper describes how touse XMorph as a query guard; gives a formal semantics for shape-to-shape …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,3
Using XMorph to transform XML data,Curtis E Dyreson; Sourav S Bhowmick; Kirankanth Mallampalli,Abstract XMorph is a new; shape polymorphic; domain-specific XML query language. Aquery in a shape polymorphic language adapts to the shape of the input; freeing the userfrom having to know the input's shape and making the query applicable to a wide variety ofdifferently shaped inputs. An XMorph query specifies the shape of the output. The XMorphquery engine transforms the input to the desired shape by shredding an XML document to agraph of closest relationships; and performing a closeness preserving transformation. Weplan to demonstrate XMorph using a Java applet; which can also be used by the audienceduring the demonstration; to evaluate various XMorph queries. The applet will show theoutput; the shapes generated by the query; and report on potential data loss in atransformation.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,3
XMorph: a shape-polymorphic; domain-specific XML data transformation language,Curtis Dyreson; Sourav Bhowmick; Aswani Rao Jannu; Kirankanth Mallampalli; Shuohao Zhang,By imposing a single hierarchy on data; XML makes queries brittle in the sense that a querymight fail to produce the desired result if it is executed on the same data organized in adifferent hierarchy; or if the hierarchy evolves during the lifetime of an application. This paperpresents a new transformation language; called XMorph; which supports more flexiblequerying. XMorph is a shape polymorphic language; that is; a single XMorph query canextract and transform data from differently-shaped hierarchies. The XMorph data shredderdistills XML data into a graph of closest relationships; which are exploited by the queryevaluation engine to produce a result in the shape specified by an XMorph query.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,3
The steady States and dynamics of urokinase-mediated plasmin activation,Lakshmi Venkatraman; Hanry Yu; Sourav S Bhowmick; FORBES DEWEY JR; Lisa Tucker-Kellogg,Abstract Plasmin and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) are ubiquitous proteasesregulating the extracellular environment. They can activate each other via proteolyticcleavage; suggesting the potential for complex dynamic behaviors that could be elucidatedby computational modeling. Ordinary differential equations are constructed to model theactivation dynamics of plasminogen into plasmin; and single-chain uPA (scUPA) into two-chain uPA (tcUPA). Computational simulations and phase plane analysis reveal two stablesteady states for the activation of each protein. Bifurcation analysis shows the in silicosystem to be bistable. Cell-free experiments verify the system to have ultrasensitiveactivation behavior; where scUPA is the stimulus and plasmin the output. Furthermore; twosignificantly different steady states could be seen in vitro for the same stimulus levels …,*,2010,3
Towards Evaluation of Symmetric XPath Axis in Tree-Unaware RDBMS,Erwin Leonardi; S Bhowmick; Zhifeng Ng; Curtis Dyreson,With the rapid emergence of xml as the de facto standard for exchanging data on the Web;the interest in efficiently querying xml data sources using mature relational technology hasincreased. On the one hand; there has been a host of work; cf;[4; 8]; on enabling relationaldatabases to be tree-aware by invading the database kernel to support xml. On the otherhand; some completely jettison the invasive approach and resort to a tree-unawareapproach; cf;[3; 7; 9; 14; 15; 17]; where the database kernel is not modified to support xmlqueries. The tree-unaware approach reuses existing code; has a lower cost ofimplementation; and is more portable since it can be implemented on top of off-the-shelfrdbmss. However; due to the lack of statistics of tree structures in underlying relationalstorage schemes; the relational optimizer may generate inefficient query plans. This is …,*,2008,3
SeqDiff: An Effective Fast Change Detection Algorithm for Biological Sequences,Yang Song; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Detecting changes to biological sequences is useful in several applications such asquick comparison of duplicate biological entities in different databases; detecting changesbetween old and new versions of newly discovered sequences of a biological entity; andmaintenance of index structure. In this paper; we present an algorithm called SeqDiff fordetecting changes to biological sequences of the same biological entity. Our algorithm isbased on the local alignment principle used in sequence alignment techniques such asBLAST. We have implemented SeqDiff in Java using J2SDK 1.4. 0. We have conducted anextensive performance study using real life genomic and proteomic sequences. Ourexperimental results show acceptable performance for detecting changes to sequence data.,*,2008,3
BioDIFF: an effective fast change detection algorithm for biological annotations,Yang Song; Sourav S Bhowmick; C Forbes Dewey,Abstract Warehousing heterogeneous; dynamic biological data is a key technique forbiological data integration as it greatly improves performance. However; it requires complexmaintenance procedures to update the warehouse in light of the changes to the sources.Consequently; a key issue to address is how to detect changes to the underlying biologicaldata sources. In this paper; we present an algorithm called BioDiff for detecting exactchanges to biological annotations. In our approach we transform heterogeneous biologicaldata to XML format and then detect changes between two versions of XML representation ofbiological data. Our algorithm extends X-Diff; a published XML change detection algorithm.X-Diff; being designed for any type of XML data; does not exploit the semantics of biologicaldata to reduce the data set of bipartite mapping. We have implemented BioDiff in Java …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,3
Efficient XML query processing in RDBMS using GUI-driven prefetching in a single-user environment,Sandeep Prakash; Sourav S Bhowmick; Klarinda G Widjanarko; C Forbes Dewey,Abstract In this paper; we address the problem of efficient processing of XQueries in single-user relational environment where the queries are formulated using a user-friendly GUI. Wetake a novel and non-traditional approach to improving query performance by prefetchingdata during the formulation of a query. The latency offered by GUI-based query formulationis utilized to prefetch portions of the query results. To realize this; we present an algorithm forprefetching based on data synopses statistics and GUI actions during visual queryformulation. Experimental evaluation indicates that prefetching is viable as the combinedtime taken by all the prefetching operations is not significantly more than normal queryexecution time. Our experiments in the context of biological data show that prefetchingimproves the query response time by 7-96% with a greater improvement for larger data …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,3
i Wed: an integrated multigraph cut-based approach for detecting Events from a website,Qiankun Zhao; Sourav S Bhowmick; Aixin Sun,Abstract The web is a sensor of the real world. Often; content of web pages correspond toreal world objects or events whereas the web usage data reflect users' opinions and actionsto the corresponding events. Moreover; the evolution patterns of the web usage data mayreflect the evolution of the corresponding events over time. In this paper; we present twovariants of i Wed (I ntegrated W eb E vent D etector) algorithm to extract events from websitedata by integrating author-centric data and visitor-centric data. We model the website relateddata as a multigraph; where each vertex represents a web page and each edge representsthe relationship between the connected web pages in terms of structure; semantic; and/orusage pattern. Then; the problem of event detection is to extract strongly connectedsubgraphs from the multigraph to represent real world events. We solve this problem by …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2006,3
Detecting changes to hybrid XML documents using relational databases,Erwin Leonardi; Sri L Budiman; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Recent works in XML change detection have focused on detecting changes toordered or unordered XML documents. However; in real life XML documents may not alwaysbe purely ordered or purely unordered. It is indeed possible to have both ordered andunordered nodes in the same XML document (such documents are called hybrid XML). Inthis paper; we present a technique for detecting the changes to hybrid XML documents. Inour approach; old and new versions of XML documents are first stored in a relationaldatabase. Then; the order learning module is used to determine the node types in hybridXML. The change detection module then uses the knowledge of node types to detect thechanges by issuing SQL queries. Our experimental results show that our approach producesbetter result quality compared to existing approaches.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2005,3
A Global-to-Local Rewriting Querying Mechanism using Semantic Mapping for XML Schema Integration,Kalpdrum Passi; Eric Chaudhry; Sanjay Madria; Sourav Bhowmick,Abstract We have proposed a methodology for integrating local XML Schemas in [12]. Anintegrated global schema forms the basis for querying a set of local XML documents. In thispaper; we discuss various strategies for rewriting the global query over the global schemainto the sub-queries over local schemas. Their respective local schemas validate the sub-queries over the local XML documents. This requires the identification and use of mappingrules and relationships between the local schemas,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2004,3

One of the key features of our approach is that we identifyand transform key attributes of query results into XML attributes. These key attributesfacilitate applications such as change detection and data integration. by efficiently identifyingrelated or identical results. Based on the proposed algorithm; we have implemented aprototype system called hw-stalker using Java. Our experiments demonstrate that HW-Transform shows acceptable performance for transforming query results to XML.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2004,3
Research Issues in Web Structural Delta Mining,Qiankun Zhao; Sourav S Bhowmick; Sanjay Madria,Abstract Web structure mining has been a well-researched area during recent years. Basedon the observation that data on the web may change at any time in any way; someincremental data mining algorithms have been proposed to update the mining results withthe corresponding changes. However; noneof the existing web structure mining techniquesis able to extract useful and hidden knowledge from the sequence of historical web structuralchanges. While the knowledge from snapshot is important and interesting; the knowledgebehind the corresponding changes may be more critical and informative in someapplications. In this paper; we propose a novel research area of web structure miningcalledweb structural delta mining. The distinct feature of our research is that our mining objectisthe sequence of historical changes of web structure (also called web structural deltas) …,Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on Foundations and New Directions of Data Mining,2003,3

Controlling Web query execution in a Web warehouse,Sourav S Bhowmick; Sanjay Madria,Most of the contemporary Web query systems have limited capabilities in controlling Webquery execution. Such query facility is important as it gives us an opportunity to optimize theevaluation of a Web query. We address this issue in the context of our Web warehousingsystem called WHOWEDA (Warehouse Of Web Data). Specifically; we investigate differenttypes of constraints (related to query execution) which may be imposed on a Web querysuch as number of query results; time of execution; restrict the evaluation of a query tospecified set of Web sites; etc. An important feature of our approach is that it attempts toaddress the query evaluation issues which may arise due to the existence of broken linksand forms in the Web.,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 2002.

TAPESTRY: Network-centric Target Prioritization in Disease-related Signaling Networks,Huey Eng Chua; Sourav S Bhowmick; Jie Zheng; Lisa Tucker-Kellogg,Abstract Target prioritization ranks molecules in biological networks according to a scorethat seeks to identify molecules that fulfill particular roles (eg; drug targets). We study thisproblem in the context of partial information (eg; unknown targets) and present TAPESTRY;a network-based approach that prioritizes candidate targets in a given signaling networkwith unknown targets by utilizing knowledge (target characteristics) gained from curatedtargets in another set of signaling networks. We consider both topological and dynamicfeatures and use a weighted sum approach to examine the relative influence of these twoclasses of features on the prioritization results. TAPESTRY exploits a knowledge base ofcharacterization models and predictive topological features of a set of signaling networks(candidate networks) with curated targets.

Data-driven visual graph query interface construction and maintenance: challenges and opportunities,Sourav S Bhowmick; Byron Choi; Curtis Dyreson,Abstract Visual query interfaces make it easy for scientists and other nonexpert users toquery a data collection. Heretofore; visual query interfaces have been statically-constructed;independent of the data. In this paper we outline a vision of a different kind of interface; onethat is built (in part) from the data. In our data-driven approach; the visual interface isdynamically constructed and maintained. A data-driven approach has many benefits such asreducing the cost in constructing and maintaining an interface; superior support for queryformulation; and increased portability of the interface. We focus on graph databases; but ourapproach is applicable to several other kinds of databases such as JSON and XML.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,2
One feature doesn't fit all: characterizing topological features of targets in signaling networks,Huey Eng Chua; Sourav S Bhowmick; Lisa Tucker-Kellogg,Abstract A key challenge facing drug discovery is the identification of target (s) in a signalingnetwork whose perturbation results in a desired therapeutic outcome. Recent studies haveshown that analysis of biological networks based on topology can facilitate targetidentification by providing valuable information on characteristics of targets. In this paper; wepresent an algorithm called Differ that discovers the discriminative topological features (dtf)from a signaling network to distinguish the targets from the non-targets. Our empirical studyon five signaling networks reveals that the majority of dtfs are able to identify most of theknown targets in these networks. Furthermore; they are distinct for different networks. That is;no single topological feature can characterise targets in all signaling networks. This is incontrast to the findings in [28] where bridging nodes are considered to be good targets …,Proceedings of the 5th ACM Conference on Bioinformatics; Computational Biology; and Health Informatics,2014,2
Incremental maintenance of the minimum bisimulation of cyclic graphs,Jintian Deng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu; Sourav S Bhowmick,There have been numerous recent applications of graph databases (eg; the Semantic Web;ontology representation; social networks; XML; chemical databases; and biologicaldatabases). A fundamental structural index for data graphs; namely minimum bisimulation;has been reported useful for efficient path query processing and optimization includingselectivity estimation; among many others. Data graphs are subject to change and theirindexes are updated accordingly. This paper studies the incremental maintenance problemof the minimum bisimulation of a possibly cyclic data graph. While cyclic graphs areubiquitous among the data on the web; previous work on the maintenance problem hasmostly focused on acyclic graphs.

STEROID: in silico heuristic target combination identification for disease-related signaling networks,Huey Eng Chua; Sourav S Bhowmick; Lisa Tucker-Kellogg; C Forbes Dewey Jr,Abstract Given a signaling network; the target combination identification problem aims topredict efficacious and safe target combinations for treatment of a disease. State-of-the-art insilico methods use Monte Carlo simulated annealing (mcsa) to modify a candidate solutionstochastically; and use the Metropolis criterion to accept or reject the proposedmodifications. However; such stochastic modifications ignore the impact of the choice oftargets and their activities on the combination's therapeutic effect and off-target effects whichdirectly affect the solution quality.

Near-miner: mining evolution associations of Web site directories for efficient maintenance of Web archives,Ling Chen; Sourav S Bhowmick; Wolfgang Nejdl,Abstract Web archives preserve the history of autonomous Web sites and are potential goldmines for all kinds of media and business analysts. The most common Web archivingtechnique uses crawlers to automate the process of collecting Web pages. However;(re)downloading entire collection of pages periodically from a large Web site is unfeasible. Inthis paper; we take a step towards addressing this problem. We devise a data mining-drivenpolicy for selectively (re) downloading Web pages that are located in hierarchical directorystructures which are believed to have changed significantly (eg; a substantial percentage ofpages are inserted to/removed from the directory). Consequently; there is no need todownload and maintain pages that have not changed since the last crawl as they can beeasily retrieved from the archive.

Mirror site maintenance based on evolution associations of web directories,Ling Chen; Sourav Bhowmick; Wolfgang Nejdl,Abstract Mirroring Web sites is a well-known technique commonly used in the Webcommunity. A mirror site should be updated frequently to ensure that it reflects the content ofthe original site. Existing mirroring tools apply page-level strategies to check each page of asite; which is inefficient and expensive. In this paper; we propose a novel site-level mirrormaintenance strategy. Our approach studies the evolution of Web directorystructures andmines association rules between ancestor-descendant Web directories. Discovered rulesindicate the evolution correlations between Web directories. Thus; when maintaining themirror of a Web site (directory); we can optimally skipsubdirectories which are negativelycorrelated with it in undergoing significant changes.

This paper studiesthree strategies for storing XML document including one representing schema-consciousapproach (Shared-Inlining) and two representing schema-oblivious approach (XParent andSucxent++). We implement and evaluate each approach using benchmark non-recursiveXQueries. Our analysis shows an interesting fact that schema-conscious approaches are notalways a better option than schema-oblivious approaches! In fact; it is possible for a schema-oblivious approach (Sucxent++) to be faster than a schema-conscious approach (Shared-Inlining) for 55% of the benchmark queries (the highest observed factor being 87.8 times) …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2006,2
VRules: an effective association-based classifier for videos,Ling Chen; Sourav S Bhowmick; Liang-Tien Chia,Abstract Video classification is an important step towards multimedia understanding. Moststate-of-the-art approaches which apply HMM to capture the temporal information of videoshave the limitation by assuming that the current state of a video depends only on theimmediate previous state. Nevertheless; this assumption may not hold for videos of variouscategories. In this paper; we present an effective video classifier which employs theassociation rule mining technique to discover the actual dependence relationship betweenvideo states. The discriminatory state transition patterns mined from different videocategories are then used to perform classification. Besides capturing the associationbetween states in the time space; we also capture the association between low-levelfeatures in spatial dimension to further distinguish the semantics of videos.

We proposed two models foraddressing our specification of the access prediction problem. The first lays out a preliminarystatistical approach using observed distributions of interaccess times of individualdocuments in the collection. To overcome its deficiencies; we adapted a stochastic model forlibrary circulations; ie; Burrell's model; that accounts for differences in mean access ratesofWeb documents.

AutoG: a visual query autocompletion framework for graph databases,Peipei Yi; Byron Choi; Sourav S Bhowmick; Jianliang Xu,Abstract Composing queries is evidently a tedious task. This is particularly true of graphqueries as they are typically complex and prone to errors; compounded by the fact thatgraph schemas can be missing or too loose to be helpful for query formulation. Despite thegreat success of query formulation aids; in particular; automatic query completion; graphquery autocompletion has received much less research attention. In this paper; we proposea novel framework for subgraph query autocompletion (called AutoG).

Pinocchio: Probabilistic influence-based location selection over moving objects,Meng Wang; Hui Li; Jiangtao Cui; Ke Deng; Sourav S Bhowmick; Zhenhua Dong,The location selection (ls) problem; which aims to mine the optimal location from a set ofcandidates to place a new facility such that a score (ie; benefit or influence on some givenobjects) can be maximized; has drawn significant research attention in recent years. State-of-the-art ls techniques assume each object is static and can only be influenced by a singlefacility. However; in reality; objects (eg; people; vehicles) are mobile and are influenced bymultiple facilities; which prevents classical ls solutions from selecting accurate results. In thispaper; we introduce a generalizedls problem called Prime-ls which takes mobility andprobability factors into consideration to address the aforementioned limitations. Specifically;given a set of candidate locations; Prime-ls aims to mine the optimal location which caninfluence the most number of moving objects.

We propose todemonstrate a system to liberate query writers from this dependence. A plug-and-play querycontains a specification of what data the query needs in order to evaluate. We implementedvirtual eXist-db to support plug-and-play XQuery queries. Our system adds a virtualDocfunction that lets a programmer sketch the hierarchy needed by the query; which may wellbe different than what the data has; and logically (not physically) transforms the data (withinformation loss guarantees) to the hierarchy specified by the virtualDoc. The demonstrationwill consist of a sequence of XQuery queries using a virtual hierarchy; including queriessuggested by the audience. We will also demonstrate a GUI tool to construct a virtual …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,1
PRISM: concept-preserving summarization of top-k social image search results,Boon Siew Seah; Sourav S Bhowmick; Aixin Sun,Abstract Most existing tag-based social image search engines present search results as aranked list of images; which cannot be consumed by users in a natural and intuitive manner.In this demonstration; we present a novel concept-preserving image search resultssummarization system called prism. prism exploits both visual features and tags of thesearch results to generate high quality summary; which not only breaks the results intovisually and semantically coherent clusters but it also maximizes the coverage of the originaltop-k search results. It first constructs a visual similarity graph where the nodes are images inthe top-k search results and the edges represent visual similarities between pairs of images.This graph is optimally decomposed and compressed into a set of concept-preservingsubgraphs based on a set of summarization criteria.

Side-effect estimation: A filtering approach to the view update problem,Yun Peng; Byron Choi; Jianliang Xu; Haibo Hu; Sourav S Bhowmick,Views and their updates have long been a fundamental technology required in a wide rangeof applications. However; it has been known that updates through views is a classicalintractable problem. In this paper; we propose a novel; data-oriented approach to thisproblem that provides a practical support for view updates. In particular; we propose asummarization of the source database of views; which serves as an update filter. The updatefilter aims to efficiently reject untranslatable view updates by estimating the side effects of theupdates; thereby avoiding costly translation analysis. For applications where estimationerrors are not preferred; our update filter can be tuned to be exact. In this paper; we presentour approach with SPJ views; an important class of view definitions. We first revise thenotion of estimation errors to quantify the filter's qualities. We then propose a novel join …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,1
Why not; WINE?,Sourav S Bhowmick; Aixin Sun; Ba Quan Truong,Abstract Despite considerable progress in recent years on Tag-based Social ImageRetrieval (TagIR); state-of-the-art TagIR systems fail to provide a systematic framework forend users to ask why certain images are not in the result set of a given query and provide anexplanation for such missing results. However; such why-not questions are natural whenexpected images are missing in the query results returned by a TagIR system. In thisdemonstration; we present a system called WINE (Why-not questIon aNswering Engine)which takes the first step to systematically answer the why-not questions posed by end-userson TagIR systems. It is based on three explanation models; namely result reordering; queryrelaxation; and query substitution; that enable us to explain a variety of why-not questions.Our answer not only involves the reason why desired images are missing in the results …,Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on World Wide Web,2014,1

Plasmin Antagonizes Positive Feedback Between TGF-β1 and TSP1: Steady States and Dynamics,Lakshmi Venkatraman; Ser-Mien Chia; BC Narmada; Liang Siang Poh; Jacob K White; Sourav Saha Bhowmick; C Forbes Dewey; Peter T So; Hanry Yu; Lisa Tucker-Kellogg,Fibrotic diseases are often caused by chronic injuries; and are characterized by pathologicalover-activation of certain stages of wound healing; particularly extracellular matrix secretion.Matrix secretion is driven by the fibrotic cytokine TGF-b1 (transforming growth factorb1);which is secreted by cells as a latent complex; and must be activated extracellularly for itsbiological function. Plasmin is a direct proteolytic activator of TGF-b1; but puzzling results infibrotic animal have shown that the plasmin pathway causes decreased TGF-b1. We usedcomputational modelling and experimental tests to understand the activation of TGF-b1; byplasmin and by the matricellular glycoprotein thrombospondin1 (TSP1). Ordinary differentialequations were used to model the dynamics of activation and feedback.

PANI: an interactive data-driven tool for target prioritization in signaling networks,Huey-Eng Chua; Sourav S Bhowmick; Lisa Tucker-Kellogg; Yingqi Wang; C Forbes Dewey Jr; Hanry Yu,Abstract Biological network analysis often aims at the target identification problem; which isto predict which molecule to inhibit (or activate) for a disease treatment to achieve optimumefficacy and safety. A related goal; arising from the increasing availability of high-throughputscreening (HTS); is to suggest many molecules as potential targets. The target prioritizationproblem is to predict a subset of molecules in a given disease-associated network which islikely to include successful drug targets. Sensitivity analysis prioritizes targets in a dynamicnetwork model according to principled criteria; but fails to penalize off-target effects; anddoes not scale for large networks. In this demonstration; we present PANI (Putative TArgetNodes PrIoritization); a novel interactive system that addresses these limitations.

In silico identification of endo16 regulators in the sea urchin endomesoderm gene regulatory network,Huey-Eng Chua; Sourav S Bhowmick; Lisa Tucker-Kellogg; Qing Zhao; C Forbes Dewey Jr; Hanry Yu,Abstract Recent functional genomics research has yielded a large in silico gene regulatorynetwork model (622 nodes) for endomesoderm development of sea urchin; a modelorganism for embryonic development. The size of this network makes it challenging todetermine which genes are most responsible for a given biological effect. In this paper; weexplore feasibility and accuracy of existing in silico techniques for identifying key genes thatregulate Endo16; a widely-accepted gastrulation marker. We apply target prioritization tools(sensitivity analysis and PANI) to the endomesoderm network to identify key regulators ofEndo16 and validate the results by comparing against a set of benchmark Endo16regulators collated from literature survey. Our study reveals that global sensitivity analysismethods are prohibitively expensive and inappropriate for large networks.

cqp-Miner: Mining Conserved XML Query Patterns For Evolution-Conscious Caching,Sourav S Bhowmick,ABSTRACT Existing xml query pattern-based caching strategies focus on extracting the setof frequently issued query pattern trees (qpt) based on the support of the qpts in the history.These approaches ignore the evolutionary features of the qpts. In this paper; we propose anovel type of query pattern called conserved query paths (cqp) for efficient caching byintegrating the support and evolutionary features together. cqps are paths in qpts that neverchange or do not change significantly most of the time (if not always) in terms of their supportvalues during a specific time period. We proposed a set of algorithms to extract frequentcqps (fcqps) and infrequent cqps (icqps) and rank these query paths using evolution-conscious ranking functions.

Ranking of web data in a web warehouse,Sanjay K Mandria; Sourav S Bhowmick; Kalpdrum Passi,Abstract Present day search engines base their search algorithms on some keywordsspecified by the user; which results in a large list of web pages that may be irrelevant to theuser. A user would like to find the most relevant web pages that are relatively small innumber. Further; the results may be ranked according to various criterion either specified bythe user or by the search engine. The keyword search techniques do not allow a user tospecify constraints on the search conditions. A web warehouse project called WHOWEDAuses a query graph supplied by a user to search and retrieve user-interested documentssatisfying the specified inter-document constraints. The results obained from a query graphbased search are called web tuples and are stored in a web table.

Efficient processing of XPath queries using indexes,Yan Chen; Sanjay Madria; Kalpdrum Passi; Sourav Bhowmick,Abstract A number of query languages have been proposed in recent times for processingqueries on XML and semistructured data. All these query languages make use of regularpath expressions to query XML data. To optimize the processing of query paths a number ofindexing schemes have also been proposed recently. XPath provides the basis forprocessing queries on XML data in the form of regular path expressions. In this paper; wepropose two algorithms called Entry-point algorithm and Rest-tree algorithm that exploitdifferent types of indexes; which we have defined to efficiently process XPath queries. Wealso discuss and compare two variations in implementing these algorithms; Root-first andBottom-first.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2002,1

Conflict of Interest Declaration and Detection System in Heterogeneous Networks,Siyuan Wu; Sourav S Bhowmick; Wolfgang Gatterbauer,Abstract Peer review is the most critical process in evaluating an article to be accepted forpublication in an academic venue. When assigning a reviewer to evaluate an article; theassignment should be aware of conflicts of interest (COIs) such that the reviews are fair toeveryone. However; existing conference management systems simply ask reviewers andauthors to declare their explicit COIs through a plain search user interface guided by somesimple conflict rules. We argue that such declaration system is not enough to discover alllatent COI cases. In this work; we study a graphical declaration system that visualizes therelationships of authors and reviewers based on a heterogeneous co-authorship network.With the help of the declarations; we attempt to detect the latent COIs automatically based onthe meta-paths of a heterogeneous network.,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,*

TINTIN: Exploiting Target Features for Signaling Network Similarity Computation and Ranking,Huey Eng Chua; Sourav S Bhowmick; Lisa Tucker-Kellogg,Abstract Network similarity ranking attempts to rank a given set of networks based on its"similarity" to a reference network. State-of-the-art approaches tend to be general in thesense that they can be applied to networks in a variety of domains. Consequently; they arenot designed to exploit domain-specific knowledge to find similar networks although suchknowledge may yield interesting insights that are unique to specific problems; paving theway to solutions that are more effective. We propose Tintin which uses a novel target feature-based network similarity distance for ranking similar signaling networks. In contrast to state-of-the-art network similarity techniques; Tintin considers both topological and dynamicfeatures in order to compute network similarity. Our empirical study on signaling networksfrom BioModels with real-world curated outcomes reveals that Tintin ranking is different …,Proceedings of the 8th ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics; Computational Biology; and Health Informatics,2017,*
TOTEM: Personal Tweets Summarization on Mobile Devices,Jin Yao Chin; Sourav S Bhowmick; Adam Jatowt,Abstract Tweets summarization aims to find a group of representative tweets for a specifictopic. In recent times; there have been several research efforts toward devising a variety oftechniques to summarize tweets in Twitter. However; these techniques are either notpersonal (ie; consider only tweets in the timeline of a specific user) or are too expensive tobe realized on a mobile device. Given that 80% of active Twitter users access the site onmobile devices; in this demonstration we present a lightweight; personalized; on-demand;topic modeling-based tweets summarization engine called TOTEM; designed for suchdevices. Specifically; TOTEM summarizes most recent tweets on a user's timeline andenables her to visualize and navigate representative topics and associated tweets in a user-friendly tap-and-swipe manner.,Proceedings of the 40th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,2017,*
ASTERIX: Ambiguity and Missing Element-Aware XML Keyword Search Engine,Ba Quan Truong; Sourav S Bhowmick; Curtis Dyreson; Hong Jing Khok,Abstract Despite a decade of research on XML keyword search (XKS); demonstration of ahigh quality XKS system has still eluded the information retrieval community. Existing XKSengines primarily suffer from two limitations. First; although the smallest lowest commonancestor (SLCA) algorithm (or a variant; eg; ELCA) is widely accepted as a meaningful wayto identify subtrees containing the query keywords; SLCA typically performs poorly ondocuments with missing elements; ie;(sub) elements that are optional; or appear in someinstances of an element type but not all. Second; since keyword search can be ambiguouswith multiple possible interpretations; it is desirable for an XKS engine to automaticallyexpand the original query by providing a classification of different possible interpretations ofthe query wrt the original results. However; existing XKS systems do not support such …,Proceedings of the 40th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,2017,*
PICASSO: exploratory search of connected subgraph substructures in graph databases,Kai Huang; Sourav S Bhowmick; Shuigeng Zhou; Byron Choi,Abstract Recently; exploratory search has received much attention in information retrievaland database fields.

Plug-and-Play Queries for Temporal Data Sockets,Curtis E Dyreson; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Plug-and-play queries are portable; reliable; and easier to code. When a plug-and-play query is plugged into a data socket; the socket transforms the data to the shape neededby the query. If data is annotated with metadata; the semantics of the metadata potentiallyimpacts the transformation. In this paper we describe how to account for the metadata in atransformation. We focus on temporal metadata and show how a transformation canpreserve temporal semantics. We also show how the transformation can be driven by themetadata; for instance; the temporal metadata could be used to create data versions.,International Conference on Flexible Query Answering Systems,2017,*

Detecting semantically correct changes to relevant unordered hidden web data,Vladimir Kovalev; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Current proposals for XML change detection use structural constraints to detect thechanges and they ignore semantic constraints. Consequently; they may producesemantically incorrect changes. In this paper; we argue that the semantics of data isimportant for change detection. We present a semantic-conscious change detectiontechnique for the hidden web data. In our approach we transform the unordered hidden webquery results to XML format and then detect the changes between two versions of XMLrepresentation of the hidden web data by extending X-Diff; a published unordered XMLchange detection algorithm. By taking advantage of the semantics; we experimentallydemonstrate that our change detection approach runs up to 7 times faster than X-Diff on reallife hidden web data and always detect changes that are semantically more correct than …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2005,*
Mining Historical XML,Qiankun Zhao; Sourav Saha Bhowmick,Abstract Nowadays the Web poses itself as the largest data repository ever available in thehistory of humankind (Reis et al.; 2004). However; the availability of huge amount of Webdata does not imply that users can get whatever they want more easily. On the contrary; themassive amount of data on the Web has overwhelmed their abilities to find the desiredinformation. It has been claimed that 99% of the data reachable on the Web is useless to99% of the users (Han & Kamber; 2000; pp. 436). That is; an individual may be interested inonly a tiny fragment of the Web data. However; the huge and diverse properties of Web datado imply that Web data provides a rich and unprecedented data mining source.,*,2005,*
Knowledge discovery using web bags in a web warehouse,Sourav B Bhowmick; Sanjay M Kumar; Wee Keong Ng; Ee Peng Lim,Abstract Sets and bags are closely related structures. A bag is different from a set in that it issensitive to the number of times an element occurs while a set is not. In this paper; weintroduce the concept of web bag in a web warehouse as a part of our the WHOWEDAproject. Informally; a web bag is a web table which allows multiple occurrences of identicalweb tuples. Web bag helps to discover useful knowledge from a web table such as visibledocuments (or web sites); luminous documents and luminous paths. We formally discuss thesemantics and properties of web bags; and illustrate with examples applications of web bagin knowledge discovery in a web warehouse.,*,2000,*
Reducing cognitive overheads in a Web warehouse using reverse-osmosis,Sourav S Bhowmick; SANJAY Madria; Wee-Keong Ng; Ee-Peng Lim,This paper provides a quantitative analysis of reducing cognitive overheads in a Webwarehouse using an important class of operation called reverse osmosis. The analysis isused to examine two different cognitive overheads of locating relevant nodes or informationand display time of a Web table. A reverse-osmosis operation enables us to eliminate inrelevant information from a collection of Web documents stored in the form of a Web table.We call such an operation reverse-osmosis because it is analogous to the reverse osmosisprocess in the field of water purification. We discuss a formal algorithm of the reverse-osmosis operation.,Parallel and Distributed Systems; 2000. Proceedings. Seventh International Conference on,2000,*
Efficient Recursive XML Query Processing Using Relational Database Systems,Sandeep Prakasha; Sourav S Bhowmicka; Sanjay Madriab,Abstract Recursive queries are quite important in the context of XML databases. In addition;several recent papers have investigated a relational approach to store XML data and thereis growing evidence that schema-conscious approaches are a better option than schema-oblivious techniques as far as query performance is concerned. However; the issue ofrecursive XML queries for such approaches has not been dealt with satisfactorily. In thispaper we argue that it is possible to design a schemaoblivious approach that outperformsschema-conscious approaches for certain types of recursive queries. To that end; wepropose a novel schema-oblivious approach; called Sucxent++(Schema Unconcious XMLEnabled System); that outperforms existing schema-oblivious approaches such as XParentby up to 15 times and schema-conscious approaches (Shared-Inlining) by up to 8 times …,*,*,*
Searching and Browsing Social Images through iAVATAR,Aixin Sun; Sourav S Bhowmick,ABSTRACT We present a novel graphical social images retrieval system; called iAVATAR(interActive VisuAl-representative TAgs Relationship); that takes a concrete step to addresssocial image search and understanding challenge. iAVATAR is the first systematic effort toexplore relationships between tags by visual-representativeness; frequency; and co-occurrence; coherently. Through the visualization of tag properties and relationships;iAVATAR offers users a visual explanation of the retrieved social images.,*,*,*
FRECLE Mining: Discovering Frequent Semantic Tree Cluster Sequences from Historical Tree Structured Data,Ling Chen; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Mining frequent trees is very useful in domains like bioinformatics; web mining;mining semistructured data; and so on. Existing techniques focus on finding “structural”patterns and ignores the “semantics” that may be associated with the subtrees. In this paperwe proposal an algorithm to mine a novel pattern called frequent semantic tree clustersequences (FRECLE); which captures the frequent sequential association between differentsemantics of tree-structured data. Given a semantic tree sequence database; the algorithmfirst categorizes each semantic tree to a semantic cluster. Next; FRECLE patterns arediscovered from the semantic cluster sequences by adopting an existing frequent sequentialpattern mining algorithm. FRECLE patterns are beneficial in applications where theknowledge of semantic association is significant; such as XML query caching; prefetching …,*,*,*
FM-WAP Mining: In Search of Frequent Mutating Web Access Patterns from Historical Web Usage Data,Qiankun Zhao; Sourav S Bhowmick,Recently; a large amount of work has been done in web access pattern (WAP) mining. Mostof the existing techniques focus on mining WAP that occur frequently from snapshot webusage data collection. However; web usage data is dynamic in real life. The dynamic natureof web usage data leads to two challenging problems. The first problem is the maintenanceof existing WAP mining results. The second problem is discovering hidden knowledge fromthe historical changes to WAP. As the frequent WAPs are useful in many applications;knowledge hidden behind the historical changes to WAPs; which reflects how WAPschange; is also critical to some applications such as adaptive web; web site maintenance;business intelligence; etc. In this paper; we propose a novel approach to discover hiddenknowledge from historical changes to WAPs. We define a new type of knowledge …,*,*,*
