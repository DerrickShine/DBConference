Physical mechanisms controlling self-aggregation of convection in idealized numerical modeling simulations,Allison A. Wing; Kerry Emanuel,We elucidate the physics of self-aggregation by applying a new diagnostic technique to theoutput of a cloud resolving model. Specifically; the System for Atmospheric Modeling is usedto perform 3-D cloud system resolving simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium in anonrotating framework; with interactive radiation and surface fluxes and fixed sea surfacetemperature (SST). We note that self-aggregation begins as a dry patch that expands;eventually forcing all the convection into a single clump. Thus; when examining the initiationof self-aggregation; we focus on processes that can amplify this initial dry patch. Weintroduce a novel method to quantify the magnitudes of the various feedbacks that controlself-aggregation within the framework of the budget for the spatial variance of column-integrated frozen moist static energy.

Radiative‐convective instability,Kerry Emanuel; Allison A Wing; Emmanuel M Vincent,Abstract [1] Radiative-moist-convective equilibrium (RCE) is a simple paradigm for thestatistical equilibrium the earth's climate would exhibit in the absence of lateral energytransport. It has generally been assumed that for a given solar forcing and long-livedgreenhouse gas concentration; such a state would be unique; but recent work suggests thatmore than one stable equilibrium may be possible. Here we show that above a criticalspecified sea surface temperature; the ordinary RCE state becomes linearly unstable tolarge-scale overturning circulations. The instability migrates the RCE state toward one of thetwo stable equilibria first found by Raymond and Zeng (2000). It occurs when the clear-skyinfrared opacity of the lower troposphere becomes so large; owing to high water vaporconcentration; that variations of the radiative cooling of the lower troposphere are …,Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems,2014,71
Relationship between the potential and actual intensities of tropical cyclones on interannual time scales,Allison A Wing; Adam H Sobel; Suzana J Camargo,Abstract [1] The thermodynamic theory for the physics of a mature tropical cyclone (TC) tellsus that the cyclone's intensity cannot exceed an upper bound; the potential intensity (PI).This combined with an empirical result due to Emanuel leads to a prediction of average TCintensity change; given the change in PI. The slope of the predicted relationship betweenpercentagewise variations in PI and those in intensity can vary between 0.5 and 1;depending on the mean PI and on what threshold is applied to the intensity data. For theAtlantic and Pacific; typical values are around 0.65 when tropical storms are excluded and0.8 when they are included. The authors use best track data for the North Atlantic andwestern North Pacific; combined with PI computed from reanalysis data sets; to test thesepredictions. The results show that observed interannual variations of maximum TC …,Geophysical research letters,2007,42
Self-aggregation of convection in long channel geometry,Allison A. Wing; Timothy W. Cronin,Abstract Cloud cover and relative humidity in the Tropics are strongly influenced byorganized atmospheric convection; which occurs across a range of spatial and temporalscales. One mode of organization that is found in idealized numerical modelling simulationsis self-aggregation; a spontaneous transition from randomly distributed convection toorganized convection despite homogeneous boundary conditions. We explore the influenceof domain geometry on the mechanisms; growth rates and length-scales of self-aggregationof tropical convection. We simulate radiative–convective equilibrium with the System forAtmospheric Modeling (SAM); in a non-rotating; highly elongated three-dimensional (3D)channel domain of length> 10 4 km; with interactive radiation and surface fluxes and fixedsea-surface temperature varying from 280–310 K.

Human influence on tropical cyclone intensity,Adam H Sobel; Suzana J Camargo; Timothy M Hall; Chia-Ying Lee; Michael K Tippett; Allison A Wing,Recent assessments agree that tropical cyclone intensity should increase as the climatewarms. Less agreement exists on the detection of recent historical trends in tropical cycloneintensity. We interpret future and recent historical trends by using the theory of potentialintensity; which predicts the maximum intensity achievable by a tropical cyclone in a givenlocal environment. Although greenhouse gas–driven warming increases potential intensity;climate model simulations suggest that aerosol cooling has largely canceled that effect overthe historical record. Large natural variability complicates analysis of trends; as do polewardshifts in the latitude of maximum intensity. In the absence of strong reductions in greenhousegas emissions; future greenhouse gas forcing of potential intensity will increasinglydominate over aerosol forcing; leading to substantially larger increases in tropical cyclone …,*,2016,33
On the factors affecting trends and variability in tropical cyclone potential intensity,Allison A Wing; Kerry Emanuel; Susan Solomon,Abstract Tropical cyclone potential intensity (V p) is controlled by thermodynamic air-seadisequilibrium and thermodynamic efficiency; which is a function of the sea surfacetemperature and the tropical cyclone's outflow temperature. Observed trends and variabilityin V p in each ocean basin are decomposed into contributions from these two components.Robustly detectable trends are found only in the North Atlantic; where tropical tropopauselayer (TTL) cooling contributes up to a third of the increase in V p. The contribution fromdisequilibrium dominates the few statistically significant V p trends in the other basins. Theresults are sensitive to the data set used and details of the V p calculation; reflectinguncertainties in TTL temperature trends and the difficulty of estimating V p and itscomponents. We also find that 20–71% of the interannual variability in V p is linked to the …,Geophysical Research Letters,2015,20
Tropical cyclones in climate models,Suzana J. Camargo; Allison A. Wing,Abstract In this review; we provide a historical overview of the simulation of tropical cyclones(TCs) in climate models; from the first attempts in the 1970s to the current state-of-the-artmodels. We discuss the status of TC simulation across multiple time scales; fromintraseasonal; seasonal; and decadal; to climate change. One of the limitations on thesimulation of TCs in climate models has been; and continues to be; balancing the highresolution necessary to accurately simulate TCs themselves with the need to run simulationsfor many years and using many ensemble members. Several approaches to inferring TCactivity indirectly; rather than relying on the models own under-resolved TCs; are reviewed;including the use of TC genesis indices based on the large-scale environment anddownscaling methods such as the use of regional climate models and statistical …,WIREs Clim Change,2015,17
Convective self-aggregation in numerical simulations: a review,Allison A Wing; Kerry Emanuel; Christopher E Holloway; Caroline Muller,Abstract Organized convection in the tropics occurs across a range of spatial and temporalscales and strongly influences cloud cover and humidity. One mode of organization found is“self-aggregation;” in which moist convection spontaneously organizes into one or severalisolated clusters despite spatially homogeneous boundary conditions and forcing. Self-aggregation is driven by interactions between clouds; moisture; radiation; surface fluxes;and circulation; and occurs in a wide variety of idealized simulations of radiative–convectiveequilibrium. Here we provide a review of convective self-aggregation in numericalsimulations; including its character; causes; and effects. We describe the evolution of self-aggregation including its time and length scales and the physical mechanisms leading to itstriggering and maintenance; and we also discuss possible links to climate and climate …,Surveys in Geophysics,2017,14
Role of radiative–convective feedbacks in spontaneous tropical cyclogenesis in idealized numerical simulations,Allison A Wing; Suzana J Camargo; Adam H Sobel,Abstract The authors perform 3D cloud-resolving simulations of radiative–convectiveequilibrium (RCE) in a rotating framework; with interactive radiation and surface fluxes andfixed sea surface temperature. A tropical cyclone is allowed to develop spontaneously froma homogeneous environment; rather than initializing the circulation with a weak vortex ormoist bubble (as is often done in numerical simulations of tropical cyclones). The resultingtropical cyclogenesis is compared to the self-aggregation of convection that occurs innonrotating RCE simulations. The feedbacks leading to cyclogenesis are quantified using avariance budget equation for the column-integrated frozen moist static energy. In the initialdevelopment of a broad circulation; feedbacks involving longwave radiation and surfaceenthalpy fluxes dominate; which is similar to the initial phase of nonrotating self …,Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences,2016,14
Observing convective aggregation,Christopher E Holloway; Allison A Wing; Sandrine Bony; Caroline Muller; Hirohiko Masunaga; Tristan S L’Ecuyer; David D Turner; Paquita Zuidema,Abstract Convective self-aggregation; the spontaneous organization of initially scatteredconvection into isolated convective clusters despite spatially homogeneous boundaryconditions and forcing; was first recognized and studied in idealized numerical simulations.While there is a rich history of observational work on convective clustering and organization;there have been only a few studies that have analyzed observations to look specifically forprocesses related to self-aggregation in models. Here we review observational work in bothof these categories and motivate the need for more of this work. We acknowledge that self-aggregation may appear to be far-removed from observed convective organization in termsof time scales; initial conditions; initiation processes; and mean state extremes; but we arguethat these differences vary greatly across the diverse range of model simulations in the …,Surveys in Geophysics,2017,7
Clouds; circulation; and climate sensitivity in a radiative-convective equilibrium channel model,TW Cronin; AA Wing,Tropical cloud and circulation changes are large sources of uncertainty in future climatechange. This problem owes partly to the scale separation between large-scale tropical dynamics( ∼ 10 4 km) and convective dynamics ( ∼ 1 km); which generally requires parameterizing convectionin models that resolve large-scale dynamics; or parameterizing (or omitting) large-scale dynamicsin models that permit convection. Here we discuss simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium(RCE) across a wide range of surface temperatures in long-channel geometry—where the domainsize and resolution marginally resolve both large-scale dynamics and convection. Self-aggregationof convection in these simulations spontaneously produces realistic dynamical regimes oflarge-scale vertical motion. The circulation weakens with surface warming but changes in thedegree of self-aggregation depend on the metric that is used; there is no obvious trend in …,Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems,2017,2
Accessible Environments for Diurnal-Period Waves in Simulated Tropical Cyclones,Morgan E O’Neill; Diamilet Perez-Betancourt; Allison A Wing,Abstract A recent observational analysis has reported significant repeating diurnal signalspropagating outward at cloud-top height from tropical cyclone centers. Modeling studiessuggest that the visible upper-level impacts reflect a diurnal cycle through the depth of thetroposphere. In this study; the possibility of wavelike diurnal responses in tropical cyclones ischaracterized using 3D cloud-resolving numerical simulations with and without a diurnalcycle. Diurnal waves can only begin to propagate well beyond the storm core; and theoutflow region is most receptive to near-core diurnal propagation because of its anticyclonicflow. The tropical cyclone structure appears particularly hostile to diurnal wave propagationduring periods when the eyewall experiences a temporary breakdown similar to an eyewallreplacement cycle.,Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences,2017,*
Process-oriented diagnosis of tropical cyclones in high-resolution GCMs,D Kim; Y Moon; SJ Camargo; AA Wing; AH Sobel; H Murakami; GA Vecchi; M Zhao; E Page,Abstract This study proposes a set of process-oriented diagnostics with the aim ofunderstanding how model physics and numerics control the representation of tropicalcyclones (TCs); especially their intensity distribution; in GCMs. Three simulations are madeusing two 50-km GCMs developed at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. Thetwo models are forced with the observed sea surface temperature [Atmospheric Modelversion 2.5 (AM2. 5) and High Resolution Atmospheric Model (HiRAM)]; and in the thirdsimulation; the AM2. 5 model is coupled to an ocean GCM [Forecast-Oriented Low OceanResolution (FLOR)]. The frequency distributions of maximum near-surface wind near TCcenters show that HiRAM tends to develop stronger TCs than the other models do. Large-scale environmental parameters; such as potential intensity; do not explain the …,Journal of Climate,2017,*
