Dynamic provable data possession,C Chris Erway; Alptekin Küpçü; Charalampos Papamanthou; Roberto Tamassia,Abstract As storage-outsourcing services and resource-sharing networks have becomepopular; the problem of efficiently proving the integrity of data stored at untrusted servers hasreceived increased attention. In the Provable Data Possession (PDP) model; the clientpreprocesses the data and then sends them to an untrusted server for storage while keepinga small amount of meta-data. The client later asks the server to prove that the stored datahave not been tampered with or deleted (without downloading the actual data). However;existing PDP schemes apply only to static (or append-only) files. We present a definitionalframework and efficient constructions for Dynamic Provable Data Possession (DPDP); whichextends the PDP model to support provable updates to stored data. We use a new version ofauthenticated dictionaries based on rank information. The price of dynamic updates is a …,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),2015,1044
Dynamic searchable symmetric encryption,Seny Kamara; Charalampos Papamanthou; Tom Roeder,Abstract Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) allows a client to encrypt its data in such away that this data can still be searched. The most immediate application of SSE is to cloudstorage; where it enables a client to securely outsource its data to an untrusted cloudprovider without sacrificing the ability to search over it. SSE has been the focus of activeresearch and a multitude of schemes that achieve various levels of security and efficiencyhave been proposed. Any practical SSE scheme; however; should (at a minimum) satisfy thefollowing properties: sublinear search time; security against adaptive chosen-keywordattacks; compact indexes and the ability to add and delete files efficiently. Unfortunately;none of the previously-known SSE constructions achieve all these properties at the sametime. This severely limits the practical value of SSE and decreases its chance of …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM conference on Computer and communications security,2012,482
Parallel and dynamic searchable symmetric encryption,Seny Kamara; Charalampos Papamanthou,Abstract Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) enables a client to outsource a collection ofencrypted documents in the cloud and retain the ability to perform keyword searches withoutrevealing information about the contents of the documents and queries. Although efficientSSE constructions are known; previous solutions are highly sequential. This is mainly due tothe fact that; currently; the only method for achieving sub-linear time search is the invertedindex approach (Curtmola; Garay; Kamara and Ostrovsky; CCS'06) which requires thesearch algorithm to access a sequence of memory locations; each of which is unpredictableand stored at the previous location in the sequence. Motivated by advances in multi-corearchitectures; we present a new method for constructing sub-linear SSE schemes. Ourapproach is highly parallelizable and dynamic.

Hawk: The blockchain model of cryptography and privacy-preserving smart contracts,Ahmed Kosba; Andrew Miller; Elaine Shi; Zikai Wen; Charalampos Papamanthou,Emerging smart contract systems over decentralized cryptocurrencies allow mutuallydistrustful parties to transact safely without trusted third parties. In the event of contractualbreaches or aborts; the decentralized blockchain ensures that honest parties obtaincommensurate compensation. Existing systems; however; lack transactional privacy. Alltransactions; including flow of money between pseudonyms and amount transacted; areexposed on the blockchain. We present Hawk; a decentralized smart contract system thatdoes not store financial transactions in the clear on the blockchain; thus retainingtransactional privacy from the public's view. A Hawk programmer can write a private smartcontract in an intuitive manner without having to implement cryptography; and our compilerautomatically generates an efficient cryptographic protocol where contractual parties …,Security and Privacy (SP); 2016 IEEE Symposium on,2016,216
Practical Dynamic Searchable Encryption with Small Leakage.,Emil Stefanov; Charalampos Papamanthou; Elaine Shi,Abstract—Dynamic Searchable Symmetric Encryption (DSSE) enables a client to encrypt hisdocument collection in a way that it is still searchable and efficiently updatable.

Practical dynamic proofs of retrievability,Elaine Shi; Emil Stefanov; Charalampos Papamanthou,Abstract Proofs of Retrievability (PoR); proposed by Juels and Kaliski in 2007; enable aclient to store n file blocks with a cloud server so that later the server can prove possessionof all the data in a very efficient manner (ie; with constant computation and bandwidth).Although many efficient PoR schemes for static data have been constructed; only twodynamic PoR schemes exist. The scheme by Stefanov et. al.(ACSAC 2012) uses a large ofamount of client storage and has a large audit cost. The scheme by Cash (EUROCRYPT2013) is mostly of theoretical interest; as it employs Oblivious RAM (ORAM) as a black box;leading to increased practical overhead (eg; it requires about 300 times more bandwidththan our construction). We propose a dynamic PoR scheme with constant client storagewhose bandwidth cost is comparable to a Merkle hash tree; thus being very practical.

Authenticated hash tables,Charalampos Papamanthou; Roberto Tamassia; Nikos Triandopoulos,Abstract Hash tables are fundamental data structures that optimally answer membershipqueries. Suppose a client stores n elements in a hash table that is outsourced at a remoteserver so that the client can save space or achieve load balancing. Authenticating the hashtable functionality; ie; verifying the correctness of queries answered by the server andensuring the integrity of the stored data; is crucial because the server; lying outside theadministrative control of the client; can be malicious. We design efficient and secureprotocols for optimally authenticating membership queries on hash tables: for any fixedconstants 0< ε< 1 and κ> 1/ε; the server can provide a proof of integrity of the answer to a(non-) membership query in constant time; requiring O (n ε/log κε--1 n) time to treat updates;yet keeping the communication and verification costs constant.

Signatures of correct computation,Charalampos Papamanthou; Elaine Shi; Roberto Tamassia,Abstract We introduce Signatures of Correct Computation (SCC); a new model for verifyingdynamic computations in cloud settings. In the SCC model; a trusted source outsources afunction f to an untrusted server; along with a public key for that function (to be used duringverification). The server can then produce a succinct signature σ vouching for thecorrectness of the computation of f; ie; that some result v is indeed the correct outcome of thefunction f evaluated on some point a. There are two crucial performance properties that wewant to guarantee in an SCC construction:(1) verifying the signature should takeasymptotically less time than evaluating the function f; and (2) the public key should beefficiently updated whenever the function changes. We construct SCC schemes (satisfyingthe above two properties) supporting expressive manipulations over multivariate …,*,2013,88
Algorithms for location estimation based on RSSI sampling,Charalampos Papamanthou; Franco P Preparata; Roberto Tamassia,Abstract In this paper; we re-examine the RSSI measurement model for location estimationand provide the first detailed formulation of the probability distribution of the position of asensor node. We also show how to use this probabilistic model to efficiently compute a goodestimation of the position of the sensor node by sampling multiple readings from thebeacons (where we do not merely use the mean of the samples) and then minimizing afunction with an acceptable computational effort. The results of the simulation of our methodin TOSSIM indicate that the location of the sensor node can be computed in a small amountof time and that the quality of the solution is competitive with previous approaches.,International Symposium on Algorithms and Experiments for Sensor Systems; Wireless Networks and Distributed Robotics,2008,72
Cs2: A searchable cryptographic cloud storage system,Seny Kamara; Charalampos Papamanthou; Tom Roeder,Abstract Cloud storage provides a highly available; easily accessible and inexpensiveremote data repository to clients who cannot afford to maintain their own storageinfrastructure. While many applications of cloud storage require security guarantees againstthe cloud provider (eg; storage of high-impact business data or medical records); mostservices cannot guarantee that the provider will not see or modify client data. This is largelybecause the current approaches for providing security (eg; encryption and digital signatures)diminish the utility and/or performance of cloud storage. This paper presents CS2; acryptographic cloud storage system that guarantees confidentiality; integrity and verifiabilitywithout sacrificing utility. In particular; while CS2 provides security against the cloudprovider; clients are still able not only to efficiently access their data through a search …,Microsoft Research; TechReport MSR-TR-2011-58,2011,66
All Your Queries Are Belong to Us: The Power of File-Injection Attacks on Searchable Encryption.,Yupeng Zhang; Jonathan Katz; Charalampos Papamanthou,Abstract The goal of searchable encryption (SE) is to enable a client to execute searchesover encrypted files stored on an untrusted server while ensuring some measure of privacyfor both the encrypted files and the search queries. Most recent research has focused ondeveloping efficient SE schemes at the expense of allowing some small; wellcharacterized“(information) leakage” to the server about the files and/or the queries. The practical impactof this leakage; however; remains unclear. We thoroughly study file-injection attacks—inwhich the server sends files to the client that the client then encrypts and stores—on thequery privacy of single-,USENIX Security Symposium,2016,63
Time and space efficient algorithms for two-party authenticated data structures,Charalampos Papamanthou; Roberto Tamassia,Abstract Authentication is increasingly relevant to data management. Data is beingoutsourced to untrusted servers and clients want to securely update and query their data.For example; in database outsourcing; a client's database is stored and maintained by anuntrusted server. Also; in simple storage systems; clients can store very large amounts ofdata but at the same time; they want to assure their integrity when they retrieve them. In thispaper; we present a model and protocol for two-party authentication of data structures.Namely; a client outsources its data structure and verifies that the answers to the querieshave not been tampered with. We provide efficient algorithms to securely outsource a skiplist with logarithmic time overhead at the server and client and logarithmic communicationcost; thus providing an efficient authentication primitive for outsourced data; both …,International conference on information and communications security,2007,59

However; these systems expose users' trustrelationships; which is considered sensitive information in today's society; to an adversary. Inthis work; we make the following contributions. First; we propose an algorithm that perturbsthe structure of a social graph in order to provide link privacy; at the cost of slight reduction inthe utility of the social graph. Second we define general metrics for characterizing the utilityand privacy of perturbed graphs. Third; we evaluate the utility and privacy of our proposedalgorithm using real world social graphs. Finally; we demonstrate the applicability of ourperturbation algorithm on a broad range of secure systems; including Sybil defenses andsecure routing.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1208.6189,2012,53

We introduce Athos; a new; platform-independent and user-transparent architecture for authenticated outsourced storage. Using light-weightcryptographic primitives and efficient data-structuring techniques; we design authenticationschemes that allow a client to efficiently verify that the file system is fully consistent with theexact history of updates and queries requested by the client. In Athos; file-system operationsare verified in time that is logarithmic in the size of the file system using optimal storagecomplexity—constant storage overhead at the client and asymptotically no extra overhead atthe server.

Optimal authenticated data structures with multilinear forms,Charalampos Papamanthou; Roberto Tamassia; Nikos Triandopoulos,Abstract Cloud computing and cloud storage are becoming increasingly prevalent. In thisparadigm; clients outsource their data and computations to third-party service providers.Data integrity in the cloud therefore becomes an important factor for the functionality of theseweb services. Authenticated data structures; implemented with various cryptographicprimitives; have been widely studied as a means of providing efficient solutions to dataintegrity problems (eg; Merkle trees). In this paper; we introduce a new authenticateddictionary data structure that employs multilinear forms; a cryptographic primitive proposedby Silverberg and Boneh in 2003 [10]; the construction of which; however; remains an openproblem to date. Our authenticated dictionary is optimal; that is; it does not add any extraasymptotic cost to the plain dictionary data structure; yielding proofs of constant size; ie …,International Conference on Pairing-Based Cryptography,2010,40
Efficient integrity checking of untrusted network storage,Alexander Heitzmann; Bernardo Palazzi; Charalampos Papamanthou; Roberto Tamassia,Abstract Outsourced storage has become more and more practical in recent years. Userscan now store large amounts of data in multiple servers at a relatively low price. Animportant issue for outsourced storage systems is to design an efficient scheme to assureusers that their data stored at remote servers has not been tampered with. This paperpresents a general method and a practical prototype application for verifying the integrity offiles in an untrusted network storage service. The verification process is managed by anapplication running in a trusted environment (typically on the client) that stores just onecryptographic hash value of constant size; corresponding to the" digest" of an authenticateddata structure. The proposed integrity verification service can work with any storage servicesince it is transparent to the storage technology used.

TWORAM: efficient oblivious RAM in two rounds with applications to searchable encryption,Sanjam Garg; Payman Mohassel; Charalampos Papamanthou,Abstract We present TWORAM; an asymptotically efficient oblivious RAM (ORAM) protocolproviding oblivious access (read and write) of a memory index y in exactly two rounds: Theclient prepares an encrypted query encapsulating y and sends it to the server. The serveraccesses memory M obliviously and returns encrypted information containing the desiredvalue M y. The cost of TWORAM is only a multiplicative factor of security parameter higherthan the tree-based ORAM schemes such as the path ORAM scheme of Stefanov et al. 34.TWORAM gives rise to interesting applications; and in particular to a 4-round symmetricsearchable encryption scheme where search is sublinear in the worst case and the searchpattern is not leaked—the access pattern can also be concealed assuming the documentsare stored in the obliviously accessed memory M.,Annual Cryptology Conference,2016,35
TRUESET: Faster Verifiable Set Computations.,Ahmed E Kosba; Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Charalampos Papamanthou; Mahmoud F Sayed; Elaine Shi; Nikos Triandopoulos,Abstract Verifiable computation (VC) enables thin clients to efficiently verify thecomputational results produced by a powerful server. Although VC was initially consideredto be mainly of theoretical interest; over the last two years impressive progress has beenmade on implementing VC. Specifically; we now have open-source implementations of VCsystems that handle all classes of computations expressed either as circuits or in the RAMmodel. Despite this very encouraging progress; new enhancements in the design andimplementation of VC protocols are required to achieve truly practical VC for real-worldapplications. In this work; we show that for functions that can be expressed efficiently interms of set operations (eg; a subset of SQL queries) VC can be enhanced to becomedrastically more practical: We present the design and prototype implementation of a novel …,USENIX Security Symposium,2014,35

The index is encrypted and transmitted (with encryptions of the files) toa remote repository.

Streaming authenticated data structures,Charalampos Papamanthou; Elaine Shi; Roberto Tamassia; Ke Yi,Abstract We consider the problem of streaming verifiable computation; where both a verifierand a prover observe a stream of n elements x 1; x 2;…; xn and the verifier can laterdelegate some computation over the stream to the prover. The prover must return the outputof the computation; along with a cryptographic proof to be used for verifying the correctnessof the output. Due to the nature of the streaming setting; the verifier can only keep small localstate (eg; logarithmic) which must be updatable in a streaming manner and with nointeraction with the prover. Such constraints make the problem particularly challenging andrule out applying existing verifiable computation schemes. We propose streamingauthenticated data structures; a model that enables efficient verification of data structurequeries on a stream.

Graph drawing for security visualization,Roberto Tamassia; Bernardo Palazzi; Charalampos Papamanthou,Abstract With the number of devices connected to the internet growing rapidly and softwaresystems being increasingly deployed on the web; security and privacy have become crucialproperties for networks and applications. Due the complexity and subtlety of cryptographicmethods and protocols; software architects and developers often fail to incorporate securityprinciples in their designs and implementations. Also; most users have minimalunderstanding of security threats. While several tools for developers; system administratorsand security analysts are available; these tools typically provide information in the form oftextual logs or tables; which are cumbersome to analyze. Thus; in recent years; the field ofsecurity visualization has emerged to provide novel ways to display security-relatedinformation so that it is easier to understand.

IntegriDB: Verifiable SQL for outsourced databases,Yupeng Zhang; Jonathan Katz; Charalampos Papamanthou,Abstract This paper presents IntegriDB; a system allowing a data owner to outsource storageof a database to an untrusted server; and then enable anyone to perform verifiable SQLqueries over that database. Our system handles a rich subset of SQL queries; includingmultidimensional range queries; JOIN; SUM; MAX/MIN; COUNT; and AVG; as well as(limited) nestings of such queries. Even for tables with 10 5 entries; IntegriDB has smallproofs (a few KB) that depend only logarithmically on the size of the database; lowverification time (tens of milliseconds); and feasible server computation (under a minute).Efficient updates are also supported.

Computational experience with exterior point algorithms for the transportation problem,Charalampos Papamanthou; Konstantinos Paparrizos; Nikolaos Samaras,Abstract An experimental computational study to compare the classical primal simplexalgorithm and the exterior point algorithms for the transportation problem (TP) is presented.Totally; four algorithms are compared on uniformly randomly generated test problems. Theresults are very encouraging for one of the competitive algorithms. In particular; a dual forestexterior point algorithm is on average up to 4.5 times faster than network simplex algorithmon TPs of size 300× 300 and for all classes. This result leads into corresponding savings incomputational time. From the computational performance we conclude that as the problemsize increases; exterior point algorithm get relatively faster.,Applied Mathematics and Computation,2004,21
Efficient verification of web-content searching through authenticated web crawlers,Michael T Goodrich; Charalampos Papamanthou; Duy Nguyen; Roberto Tamassia; Cristina Videira Lopes; Olga Ohrimenko; Nikos Triandopoulos,Abstract We consider the problem of verifying the correctness and completeness of the resultof a keyword search. We introduce the concept of an authenticated web crawler and presentits design and prototype implementation. An authenticated web crawler is a trusted programthat computes a specially-crafted signature over the web contents it visits. This signatureenables (i) the verification of common Internet queries on web pages; such as conjunctivekeyword searches---this guarantees that the output of a conjunctive keyword search iscorrect and complete;(ii) the verification of the content returned by such Internet queries---this guarantees that web data is authentic and has not been maliciously altered since thecomputation of the signature by the crawler.

Alitheia: Towards practical verifiable graph processing,Yupeng Zhang; Charalampos Papamanthou; Jonathan Katz,Abstract We consider a scenario in which a data owner outsources storage of a large graphto an untrusted server; the server performs computations on this graph in response toqueries from a client (whether the data owner or others); and the goal is to ensureverifiability of the returned results. Existing work on verifiable computation (VC) wouldcompile each graph computation to a circuit or a RAM program and then use generictechniques to produce a cryptographic proof of correctness for the result. Unfortunately; suchan approach will incur large overhead; especially in the proof-computation time. In this workwe address the above by designing; building; and evaluating ALITHEIA; a nearly practicalVC system tailored for graph queries such as computing shortest paths; longest paths; andmaximum flow.

Applications of parameterized st-orientations in graph drawing algorithms,Charalampos Papamanthou; Ioannis G Tollis,Abstract Many graph drawing algorithms use st-numberings (st-orien-tations or bipolarorientations) as a first step. An st-numbering of a biconnected undirected graph defines adirected graph with no cycles; one single source s and one single sink t. As there existexponentially many st-numberings that correspond to a certain undirected graph G; usingdifferent st-numberings in various graph drawing algorithms can result in aestheticallydifferent drawings with different area bounds. In this paper; we present results concerningnew algorithms for parameterized st-orientations; their impact on graph drawing algorithmsand especially in visibility representations.,International Symposium on Graph Drawing,2005,18

Several algorithms have been proposedin the past to compute an s t-orientation of a biconnected graph. In this paper; we presentnew algorithms that compute such orientations with certain (parameterized) characteristicsin the final s t-oriented graph; such as the length of the longest path. This work has manyapplications; including Graph Drawing and Network Routing; where the length of the longestpath is vital in deciding certain features of the final solution. This work applies to otherdifficult problems as well; such as graph coloring and of course longest path.

3D Visualization of semantic metadata models and ontologies,Charalampos Papamanthou; Ioannis G Tollis; Martin Doerr,Abstract We propose an algorithm for the 3D visualization of general ontology models usedin many applications; such as semantic web; entity-relationship diagrams and otherdatabase models. The visualization places entities in the 3D space. Previous techniquesproduce drawings that are 2-dimensional; which are often complicated and hard tocomprehend. Our technique uses the third dimension almost exclusively for the display ofthe isa relationships (links) while the property relationships (links) are placed on some layer(plane). Thus the semantic difference between isa links and property links; which should beas vertical or as horizontal as possible respectively; is emphasized.

Authenticated hash tables based on cryptographic accumulators,Charalampos Papamanthou; Roberto Tamassia; Nikos Triandopoulos,Abstract Suppose a client stores nn elements in a hash table that is outsourced to anuntrusted server. We address the problem of authenticating the hash table operations;where the goal is to design protocols capable of verifying the correctness of queries andupdates performed by the server; thus ensuring the integrity of the remotely stored dataacross its entire update history. Solutions to this authentication problem allow the client togain trust in the operations performed by a faulty or even malicious server that lies outsidethe administrative control of the client. We present two novel schemes that implement anauthenticated hash table.

Oblivious network RAM and leveraging parallelism to achieve obliviousness,Dana Dachman-Soled; Chang Liu; Charalampos Papamanthou; Elaine Shi; Uzi Vishkin,Abstract Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is a cryptographic primitive that allows a trusted CPU tosecurely access untrusted memory; such that the access patterns reveal nothing aboutsensitive data. ORAM is known to have broad applications in secure processor design andsecure multi-party computation for big data. Unfortunately; due to a logarithmic lower boundby Goldreich and Ostrovsky (Journal of the ACM;'96); ORAM is bound to incur a moderatecost in practice. In particular; with the latest developments in ORAM constructions; we arequickly approaching this limit; and the room for performance improvement is small. In thispaper; we consider new models of computation in which the cost of obliviousness can befundamentally reduced in comparison with the standard ORAM model.

How to Use SNARKs in Universally Composable Protocols.,Ahmed E Kosba; Zhichao Zhao; Andrew Miller; Yi Qian; T-H Hubert Chan; Charalampos Papamanthou; Rafael Pass; Abhi Shelat; Elaine Shi,Abstract The past several years have seen tremendous advances in practical; general-purpose; noninteractive proof systems called SNARKs.

Several algorithms have been proposedin the past to compute an st-orientation of a biconnected graph. However; as indicated in [1];the computation of more than one st-orientation is very important for many applications inmultiple research areas; such as this of Graph Drawing. In this paper we show how tocompute such orientations with certain (parameterized) characteristics in the final st-orientedgraph; such as the length of the longest path. Apart from Graph Drawing; this work applies inother areas such as Network Routing and in tackling difficult problems such as GraphColoring and Longest Path. We present primary approaches to the problem of computinglongest path parameterized st-orientations of graphs; an analytical presentation (together …,International Symposium on Graph Drawing,2006,7

We derive pruningcriteria; which significantly improve both the number of vertex-time pairs expanded duringsearch and the memory required to ensure the correctness of any solution algorithm. Wethen prove new complexity results; which imply that the problem of computing constrainedcost-optimal paths in a discrete-time setting is polynomially solvable for several graph andconstraint classes.,J.

Fast searchable encryption with tunable locality,Ioannis Demertzis; Charalampos Papamanthou,Abstract Searchable encryption (SE) allows a client to outsource a dataset to an untrustedserver while enabling the server to answer keyword queries in a private manner. SE can beused as a building block to support more expressive private queries such as range/point andboolean queries; while providing formal security guarantees. To scale SE to big data usingexternal memory; new schemes with small locality have been proposed; where locality isdefined as the number of non-continuous reads that the server makes for each query.Previous space-efficient SE schemes achieve optimal locality by increasing the readefficiency-the number of additional memory locations (false positives) that the server readsper result item. This can hurt practical performance. In this work; we design; formally provesecure; and evaluate the first SE scheme with tunable locality and linear space.

Applications of Parameterized st-Orientations.,Charalampos Papamanthou; Ioannis G Tollis,Abstract An st-orientation of a biconnected undirected graph defines a directed graph withno cycles; a single source s and a single sink t. Given an undirected graph G as input; linear-time algorithms have been proposed for computing an st-orientation of G. Such anorientation is useful especially in graph drawing algorithms which use it at their first stage[23]. Namely; before they process the original undirected graph they receive as input; theytransform it into an st-DAG; by computing an st-orientation of it. In this paper we observe thatusing st-orientations of different longest path lengths in various applications can result indifferent solutions; each one having its own merit. Guided by this intuition; we present resultsconcerning applications of proposed algorithms for longest path parameterized st-orientations. Specifically; we show how to achieve considerable space savings (eg; O (n)) …,J. Graph Algorithms Appl.,2010,5
Streaming authenticated data structures: Abstraction and implementation,Yi Qian; Yupeng Zhang; Xi Chen; Charalampos Papamanthou,Abstract In the setting of streaming verifiable computation; a verifier and a prover observe astream of n elements x 1; x 2;:::; xn and later; the verifier can delegate a computation (eg; arange search query) to the untrusted prover over the stream. The prover returns the result ofthe computation and a cryptographic proof for its correctness. To verify the prover's resultefficiently; the verifier keeps small local (logarithmic) state; which he updates whileobserving the stream. The challenge is to enable the verifier to update his local state with nointeraction with the prover; while ensuring the prover can compute proofs efficiently.Papamanthou et al.(EUROCRYPT 2013) introduced streaming authenticated data structures(SADS) to address the above problem. Yet their scheme is complex to describe andimpractical to implement; mainly due to the use of Ajtai's lattice-based hash function.

Update-Optimal Authenticated Structures Based on Lattices.,Charalampos Papamanthou; Roberto Tamassia,Abstract: We study the problem of authenticating a\emph {dynamic table} with $ n $ entries inthe authenticated data structures model; which is related to memory checking. We presentthe first dynamic authenticated table that is\emph {update-optimal}; using a\emph {lattice-based} construction. In particular; the update time is $ O (1) $; improving in this way the``apriori''$ O (\log n) $ update bounds for previous constructions; such as the Merkle tree.Moreover; the space used by our data structure is $ O (n) $ and logarithmic bounds hold forthe other complexity measures; such as\emph {proof size}. To achieve this result; we exploitthe\emph {linearity} of lattice-based hash functions and show how the security of lattice-based digests can be guaranteed under updates.

We describe the exterior point algorithm using three different initialization methods.Effective implementations are explored for each initialization method. Then we perform anexperimental evaluation on a large set of benchmark problems from the TSPLib 95 and ORLibrary collections. The results obtained demonstrate the advantages of the threeinitialization methods. Finally; we give a theoretical justification of the initialization methodsefficiency.

Accountable Storage,Giuseppe Ateniese; Michael T Goodrich; Vassilios Lekakis; Charalampos Papamanthou; Evripidis Paraskevas; Roberto Tamassia,Abstract We introduce Accountable Storage (AS); a framework enabling a client to outsourcen file blocks to a server while being able (any time after outsourcing) to provably computehow many bits were discarded or corrupted by the server. Existing techniques (eg; proofs ofdata possession or storage) can address the accountable storage problem; with linearserver computation and bandwidth. Instead; our optimized protocols achieve O (δ\log n) O (δlog n) complexity (where δ δ is the maximum number of corrupted blocks that can betolerated) through the novel use of invertible Bloom filters and a new primitive called proofsof partial storage. With accountable storage; a client can be compensated with a dollaramount proportional to the number d of corrupted bits (that he can now provably compute).We integrate our protocol with Bitcoin; supporting automatic such compensations.

Oblivious Network RAM.,Dana Dachman-Soled; Chang Liu; Charalampos Papamanthou; Elaine Shi; Uzi Vishkin,Abstract Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is a cryptographic primitive that allows a trusted CPU tosecurely access untrusted memory; such that the access patterns reveal nothing aboutsensitive data. ORAM is known to have broad applications in secure processor design andsecure multi-party computation for big data. Unfortunately; due to a well-known logarithmiclower bound by Goldreich and Ostrovsky (Journal of the ACM;'96); ORAM is bound to incur amoderate cost in practice. In particular; with the latest developments in ORAM constructions;we are quickly approaching this limit; and the room for performance improvement is small. Inthis paper; we consider new models of computation in which the cost of obliviousness canbe fundamentally reduced in comparison with the standard ORAM model.

A Zero-Knowledge Version of vSQL,Yupeng Zhang; Daniel Genkin; Jonathan Katz; Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Charalampos Papamanthou,Abstract Zero-knowledge arguments of knowledge are powerful cryptographic primitives thatallow a computationally strong prover to convince a weaker verifier for the validity of a an NPstatement; without revealing anything about the corresponding witness (beyond itsexistence). All state-of-the art implementations of such arguments follow the quadraticarithmetic program paradigm. One notable exception to this is the vSQL system of [Zhang etal. IEEE S&P 2017] which takes an entirely different approach resulting is significantly lesscryptographic operations. However; it has the notable downside that is not zero-knowledge(ie; it does not hide the witness from the verifier); a property that has proven to be of utmostimportance in many application (eg; in cryptocurrencies). In this work; we present a zero-knowledge version of the argument upon which vSQL is based. Our construction utilizes …,*,2017,2
Mommie knows best: systematic optimizations for verifiable distributed algorithms,Petros Maniatis; Michael Dietz; Charalampos Papamanthou,Complex distributed algorithms become running systems through an integration withoptimizations that target the system's deployment environment. Although expedient; thisapproach has disadvantages. First; this often makes implementing the algorithm difficult;since its logic must be composed with the optimizations. Second; proving the guarantees ofthe implementation is tedious; because the proofs must be derived for the composedalgorithm; which may not be directly mappable to the original; unoptimized algorithm.Finally; retargeting the implementation to a different deployment—requiring a different set ofoptimizations—can be wasteful; since a new composed algorithm must be derived to includethis different set of optimizations; including their correctness proofs.

Cs2: A searchable cryptographic cloud storage system;” Microsoft Research,Seny Kamara; Charalampos Papamanthou; Tom Roeder,Abstract Cloud storage provides a highly available; easily accessible and inexpensiveremote data repos-itory to clients who cannot afford to maintain their own storageinfrastructure. While many ap-plications of cloud storage require security guarantees againstthe cloud provider (eg; storage of high-impact business data or medical records); mostservices cannot guarantee that the provider will not see or modify client data. This is largelybecause the current approaches for providing security (eg; encryption and digital signatures)diminish the utility and/or performance of cloud storage. This paper presents CS2; acryptographic cloud storage system that guarantees confidentiality; integrity and verifiabilitywithout sacrificing utility. In particular; while CS2 provides security against the cloudprovider; clients are still able not only to efficiently access their data through a search …,*,2011,2
Cryptography for Efficiency: Authenticated Data Structures Based on Lattices and Parallel Online Memory Checking.,Charalampos Papamanthou; Roberto Tamassia,Abstract. In this work; we initially design a new authenticated data structure for a dynamictable with n entries. We present the first dynamic authenticated table that is update-optimal;using a lattice-based construction. In particular; the update complexity is O (1); improving inthis way the “a priori” O (log n) update bounds of previous constructions; such as the Merkletree. Moreover; the space complexity of our authenticated data structure is O (n) andlogarithmic bounds hold for other performance measures; such as proof complexity (numberof group elements contained in the proof). To achieve this result; we establish and exploit aproperty that we call repeated linearity of lattice-based hash functions and show how thesecurity of lattice-based digests can be guaranteed under updates.

Worst case examples of an exterior point algorithm for the assignment problem,Charalampos Papamanthou; Konstantinos Paparrizos; Nikolaos Samaras; Konstantinos Stergiou,Abstract An efficient exterior point simplex type algorithm for the assignment problem hasbeen developed by Paparrizos [K. Paparrizos; An infeasible (exterior point) simplexalgorithm for assignment problems; Math. Program. 51 (1991) 45–54]. This algorithmbelongs to the category of forest algorithms and solves an n× n assignment problem in atmost n (n− 1) 2 iterations and in at most O (n 3) time. In this paper worst case examples arepresented. Specifically; a systematic procedure to construct worst case assignmentproblems is presented for the exterior point algorithm. The algorithm applied to theseexamples executes exactly n (n− 1) 2 iterations. This result verifies that the bound O (n 3) isthe best possible for the above-mentioned algorithm.,Discrete Optimization,2008,2
On the Complexity of the Minimum Independent Set Partition Problem,T-H Hubert Chan; Charalampos Papamanthou; Zhichao Zhao,Abstract We consider the Minimum Independent Set Partition Problem (MISP MISP) and itsdual (MISPDual MISPDual). The input is a multi-set of N vectors from {0; 1\}^ n 0; 1 n; whereU:={1; ...; n\} U:= 1;…; n is the index set. In MISP MISP; a threshold k is given and the goal isto partition U into a minimum number of subsets such that the projected vectors on eachsubset of indices have multiplicity at least k; where the multiplicity is the number of times avector repeats in the (projected) multi-set. In MISPDual MISPDual; a target number χ χ isgiven instead of k; and the goal is to partition U into χ χ subsets to maximize k such that eachprojected vector appears at least k times. The problem is inspired from applications inprivate voting verification. Each of the N vectors corresponds to a voter's preference for ncontests.

Apparatus; methods; and computer program products providing dynamic provable data possession,*,In one exemplary embodiment; a method includes: storing data for a file; organized asblocks; each having a portion of the file; and maintaining a skip list for the data. The skip listis an ordered tree structure having a root node; internal nodes and leaf nodes. Each leafnode corresponds to a block. Each node has a rank value corresponding to size of a subtreerooted at the node. The skip list employs a hashing scheme. The hash value of the root nodeand internal nodes is computed from a level of the node; the rank value and an intervalbetween the node and another linked node to the right of or below the node. The hash valueof the leaf nodes is computed from a level of the node; the rank value and an intervalassociated with the node.,*,2015,1

Depth First Search & Directed Acyclic Graphs,Charalampos Papamanthou,Depth First Search (DFS) is a systematic way of visiting the nodes of either a directed or anundirected graph. As with breadth first search; DFS has a lot of applications in manyproblems in Graph Theory. It comprises the main part of many graph algorithms. DFS visitsthe vertices of a graph in the following manner. It selects a starting vertex v. Then it choosesan incident edge (v; w) and searches recursively deeper in the graph whenever possible. Itdoes not examine all the incident edges one by one at the same time; but on the other hand;it goes deeper and deeper in the graph till no other such path exists. When all edgesincident to v have been explored; the algorithm backtracks to explore edges leaving thevertex from which v was discovered.,Review for the course,2004,1

vRAM: Faster verifiable RAM with program-independent preprocessing,Yupeng Zhang; Daniel Genkin; Jonathan Katz; Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Charalampos Papamanthou,Abstract—We study the problem of verifiable computation (VC) for RAM programs; where acomputationally weak verifier outsources the execution of a program to a powerful (butuntrusted) prover. Existing efficient implementations of VC protocols require an expensivepreprocessing phase that binds the parties to a single circuit.(While there are schemes thatavoid preprocessing entirely; their performance remains significantly worse thanconstructions with preprocessing.) Thus; a prover and verifier are forced to choose betweentwo approaches:(1) Allow verification of arbitrary RAM programs; at the expense ofefficiency; by preprocessing a universal circuit which can handle all possible instructionsduring each CPU cycle; or (2) Sacrifice expressiveness by preprocessing an efficient circuitwhich is tailored to the verification of a single specific RAM program.

Efficient Dynamic Searchable Encryption with Forward Privacy,Mohammad Etemad; Alptekin Küpçü; Charalampos Papamanthou; David Evans,Abstract Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) enables a client to perform searches overits outsourced encrypted files while preserving privacy of the files and queries.

Practical Private Range Search In Depth,IOANNIS DEMERTZIS; STAVROS PAPADOPOULOS; ODYSSEAS PAPAPETROU; ANTONIOS DELIGIANNAKIS; MINOS GAROFALAKIS; CHARALAMPOS PAPAMANTHOU,We focus on a setting with two parties; a data owner and a server. The owner outsources itsdataset to the server; and gives the latter the authority to answer range queries on a singleattribute. The server is untrusted; and the goal is to protect the privacy of the dataset and thequeries. The owner encrypts its data prior to sending them to the server. The challenge liesin enabling the server to process the owner's queries directly on the encrypted data; whileachieving performance and costs close to the non-private case.

Understanding User Tradeoffs for Search in Encrypted Communication,Wei Bai; Ciara Lynton; Charalampos Papamanthou; Michelle L Mazurek,Abstract—End-to-end message encryption is the only way to achieve absolute messageprivacy. However; searching over end-to-end encrypted messages is complicated. Severalpopular instant messaging tools (eg; WhatsApp; iMessage) circumvent this inconvenienceby storing the search index locally on the devices. Another approach; called searchableencryption; allows users to search encrypted messages without storing the search indexlocally. These approaches have inherent tradeoffs between usability and security properties;yet little is known about how general users value these tradeoffs; especially in the context ofemail rather than instant messaging. In this paper; we systematize these tradeoffs in order toidentify key feature differences. We use these differences as the basis for a choice-basedconjoint analysis experiment focused on email (n= 160); in which participants make a …,*,*,*
Searchable Encryption with Optimal Locality: Achieving Sublogarithmic Read Efficiency,Ioannis Demertzis; Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Charalampos Papamanthou,Abstract. We propose the first linear-space searchable encryption scheme with constantlocality and sublogarithmic read efficiency; strictly improving the previously best known readefficiency bound (Asharov et al.; STOC 2016) from Θ (log N log log N) to O (logγ N) where γ=2 3+ δ for any fixed δ> 0. Our scheme employs four different allocation algorithms for storingthe keyword lists; depending on the size of the list considered each time. For ourconstruction we develop (i) new probability bounds for the offline two-choice allocationproblem;(ii) and a new I/O-efficient oblivious RAM with O (n1/3) bandwidth overhead andzero failure probability; both of which can be of independent interest.,*,*,*
