Antioxidant activities of peel; pulp and seed fractions of common fruits as determined by FRAP assay,Changjiang Guo; Jijun Yang; Jingyu Wei; Yunfeng Li; Jing Xu; Yugang Jiang,Abstract The antioxidant activities of peel; pulp and seed fractions of 28 fruits commonlyconsumed in China were determined using the ferric reducing/antioxidant power assay(FRAP assay). The contribution of vitamin C to the antioxidant activity of fruit pulps was alsocalculated. The results showed that hawthorn pulp had the highest FRAP value among allfruit pulps and followed by date; guava; kiwifruit; purple mulberry; strawberry; whitepomegranate; lukan and honey tangerine pulps and etc. Most of fruit peel and seed fractionswere stronger than the pulp fractions in antioxidant activity based on their FRAP values. Thecontribution of vitamin C to the FRAP value of fruit pulps varied greatly from fruit to fruit ascalculated. We concluded that peel and seed fractions of some fruits; such as pomegranatepeel; grape seed; hawthorn peel; longan and lychee seeds possessed relatively high …,Nutrition Research,2003,670
Gene movement by Helitron transposons contributes to the haplotype variability of maize,Jinsheng Lai; Yubin Li; Joachim Messing; Hugo K Dooner,Abstract Different maize inbred lines are polymorphic for the presence or absence of genicsequences at various allelic chromosomal locations. In the bz genomic region; located in 9S;sequences homologous to four different genes from rice and Arabidopsis are present in lineMcC but absent from line B73. It is shown here that this apparent intraspecific violation ofgenetic colinearity arises from the movement of genes or gene fragments by Helitrons; arecently discovered class of eukaryotic transposons. Two Helitrons; HelA and HelB; accountfor all of the genic differences distinguishing the two bz locus haplotypes. HelA is 5.9 kb longand contains sequences for three of the four genes found only in the McC bz genomicregion. A nearly identical copy of HelA was isolated from a 5S chromosomal location in B73.Both the 9S and 5S sites appear to be polymorphic in maize; suggesting that these …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2005,235

The effect of innate immunity on autoimmune diabetes and the expression of Toll-like receptors on pancreatic islets,Li Wen; Jian Peng; Zhenjun Li; F Susan Wong,Viral infections have previously been implicated as a trigger of autoimmune diabetes. In thisstudy; we compared a viral mimic with other microbial components derived from bacteria intriggering diabetes development in C57BL/6-rat insulin promoter-B7. 1 mice that do notnormally develop diabetes. It is striking that only the viral mimic induced the development ofdiabetes in our model system. Further mechanistic studies suggest that diabetes is induced;in part; by the combination of direct recognition of this virus-like stimulus by pancreatic isletsthrough the expression of the innate immune receptor; Toll-like receptor 3. In addition; thefunctions of APCs are up-regulated; and this could stimulate islet Ag-reactive T cells that willattack β cells leading to autoimmune diabetes.,The Journal of Immunology,2004,152
Optimization of frequent itemset mining on multiple-core processor,Li Liu; Eric Li; Yimin Zhang; Zhizhong Tang,Abstract Multi-core processors are proliferated across different domains in recent years. Inthis paper; we study the performance of frequent pattern mining on a modern multi-coremachine. A detailed study shows that; even with the best implementation; current FP-treebased algorithms still under-utilize a multi-core system due to poor data locality andinsufficient parallelism expression. We propose two techniques: a cache-conscious FP-array(frequent pattern array) and a lock-free dataset tiling parallelization mechanism to addressthis problem. The FP-array efficiently improves the data locality performance; and makes useof the benefits from hardware and software prefetching. The result yields an overall 4.0speedup compared with the state-of-the-art implementation. Furthermore; to unlock thepower of multi-core processor; a lock-free parallelization approach is proposed to …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,134

In the “cold” regions cavityresonances can occur; synchronizing the ac Josephson currents and giving rise to strongand stable coherent terahertz (THz) emission. We investigate the interplay of hot spots andstanding electromagnetic waves by low-temperature scanning laser microscopy and THzemission measurements; using stacks of various geometries. Standing electromagneticwave patterns and THz emission are observed for a disk-shaped sample. The growth of ahot spot with increasing input power is monitored by small detector junctions surrounding alarge rectangular mesa.

Effect of CD28 signal transduction on c-Rel in human peripheral blood T cells.,Richard G Bryan; Yongqin Li; Jenn-Haung Lai; M Van; NANCY R Rice; RR Rich; TH Tan,ABSTRACT Optimal T-cell activation requires both an antigen-specific signal deliveredthrough the T-cell receptor and a costimulatory signal which can be delivered through theCD28 molecule. CD28 costimulation induces the expression of multiple lymphokines;including interleukin 2 (IL-2). Because the c-Rel transcription factor bound to and activatedthe CD28 response element within the IL-2 promoter; we focused our study on themechanism of CD28-mediated regulation of c-Rel in human peripheral blood T cells. Weshowed that CD28 costimulation accelerated the kinetics of nuclear translocation of c-Rel(and its phosphorylated form); p50 (NFKB1); and p65 (RelA). The enhanced nucleartranslocation of c-Rel correlated with the stimulation of Il-2 production and T-cell proliferationby several distinct anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies. This is explained at least in part by …,Molecular and Cellular Biology,1994,92
Oxygen-vacancy-related dielectric relaxations in SrTiO3 at high temperatures,CC Wang; CM Lei; GJ Wang; XH Sun; T Li; SG Huang; H Wang; YD Li,We herein present comparative investigation on the dielectric properties of both ceramic andsingle crystal SrTiO3 samples in the temperature from room temperature to 1073 K. Tworelaxations were observed in both samples. They behave as Debye-like and relaxor-likerelaxations in ceramic and single crystal samples; respectively. These relaxations werefound to be bulk effect related to oxygen-vacancy. In single crystal sample; the relaxationsresult from the long-range conduction associated with singly and doubly charged oxygenvacancies. In ceramic sample; the oxygen vacancies are more strongly localized in relationto the crystal. This leads to a new phenomenon of formation and dissociation of oxygenvacancy clusters before the vacancies make contribution to the long-range conduction. Thelow-temperature relaxation in ceramic sample was determined by the clustering and …,Journal of Applied Physics,2013,78
Fast multi-frame motion estimation algorithm with adaptive search strategies in H. 264,Xiang Li; Eric Q Li; Yen-Kuang Chen,In the new H. 264/AVC video coding standard; motion estimation takes up a significantencoding time; especially when using the straightforward full search algorithm (FS). A fastflexible multi-frame motion estimation algorithm with adaptive search strategies (FMASS) ispresented. With special considerations on the multiple reference frames and block modes;several techniques; ie; adaptive search strategies for single frame and flexible multi-frameselection; have been utilized to improve significantly the speed-up performance in H. 264.Extensive simulations show that it can minimize the matching points by more than 1190times compared with FS. In addition; the output quality of the encoded sequences loses only0.053 dB in terms of PSNR on average. Fast speed-up performance and unnoticeablequality losses make the proposed algorithm outperform most of the other well-known …,Acoustics; Speech; and Signal Processing; 2004. Proceedings.(ICASSP'04).

One-step hydrogenolysis of glycerol to biopropanols over Pt–H 4 SiW 12 O 40/ZrO 2 catalysts,Shanhui Zhu; Yulei Zhu; Shunli Hao; Hongyan Zheng; Tao Mo; Yongwang Li,The one-step hydrogenolysis of biomass-derived glycerol to propanols (1-propanol+ 2-propanol); which are known as biopropanols; was investigated over different supported Pt–H4SiW12O40 (HSiW) bi-functional catalysts in aqueous media. Among thecatalysts/supports tested; Pt–HSiW supported over ZrO2 converted glycerol to biopropanolswith high selectivity and high yield (94.1%); while exhibiting long-term stability (160 h). Inaddition; this catalyst can be resistant to the impurities present in crude glycerol. Thereaction pathway to propanols from glycerol is proposed to proceed mainly through 1; 2-propanediol. With the strategy toward one-step hydrogenolysis of glycerol to biopropanolssustainably; the biomass can be readily transformed to biodiesel and biopropanols viaglycerol; which will bring about the benign development of the biodiesel industry.,Green Chemistry,2012,71
A study of furfural decarbonylation on K-doped Pd/Al2O3 catalysts,Wei Zhang; Yulei Zhu; Shasha Niu; Yongwang Li,Abstract Vapor-phase decarbonylation of furfural to furan was performed on K-doped Pd/Al 2O 3 catalysts in a fixed-bed reactor. A series of K-doped catalysts were prepared byimpregnation method with various potassium salt precursors and different potassiumcontent. The catalyst evaluation results revealed that the doping of K not only promoted thefurfural decarbonylation; but also suppressed the hydrogenation side reaction. Among theinvestigated catalysts; Pd–K 2 CO 3/Al 2 O 3 (K%= 8 wt.%) presented the best performanceand achieved the furan yields up to 99.5% at 260° C. The selectivity of 2-methylfuran wouldapproach zero at high K content (K%> 4 wt.%). Furthermore; the catalysts werecharacterized by BET; SEM; ICP; H 2-TPR; H 2-TPD; H 2-chemisorption; CO-FTIR; furfural-TPSR; and furfural-FTIR experiments.

Pressure induced phase transition in ZnS,Xiang-Rong Chen; Xiao-Feng Li; Ling-Cang Cai; Jun Zhu,Abstract The phase transition of ZnS from the zincblende (ZB) structure to the rocksalt (RS)structure is investigated by the ab initio plane-wave pseudopotential density functionaltheory method. It is found that the pressures for transition from the ZB structure to the RSstructure are 17.5 GPa from total energy–volume data and 15.4 GPa from equal enthalpies;consistent with the experimental data. From the high pressure elastic constants obtained; wefind that the ZB structure ZnS is unstable when the applied pressure is larger than 17 GPa.Moreover; the dependence of the normalized primitive cell volume V/V 0 on pressure P canalso be successfully obtained.,Solid state communications,2006,63
Effect of GA3 spraying on lignin and auxin contents and the correlated enzyme activities in bayberry (Myrica rubra Bieb.) during flower-bud induction,Xingjun Li; Sanyu Li; JinXing Lin,Abstract The effect of gibberellic acid (GA 3) spraying on the contents of lignin and auxin;and the activities of correlated enzymes during flower-bud induction was determined in 13-year-old bayberry trees (Myrica rubra Bieb.) in the year of low crop. The results show that theactivity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL); polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase(POD) in the leaves of the control trees reached the maximum in turns during the period offlower-bud induction; catalyzing the biosynthesis of lignin which was depleted during flower-bud initiation. GA 3 spraying during flower-bud induction significantly inhibited the activitiesof PAL; PPO; POD and IAA-oxidase (IAAo); and increased the level of indole-3-acetic acid(IAA); delaying the biosynthesis of lignin in leaves of the current shoots; as well as inducingthe more vigorous growth and inhibiting flower-bud initiation and formation.,Plant Science,2003,63

Bundled depth-map merging for multi-view stereo,Jianguo Li; Eric Li; Yurong Chen; Lin Xu; Yimin Zhang,Depth-map merging is one typical technique category for multi-view stereo (MVS)reconstruction. To guarantee accuracy; existing algorithms usually require either sub-pixellevel stereo matching precision or continuous depth-map estimation. The merging ofinaccurate depth-maps remains a challenging problem. This paper introduces a bundleoptimization method for robust and accurate depth-map merging. In the method; depth-mapsare generated using DAISY feature; followed by two stages of bundle optimization. The firststage optimizes the track of connected stereo matches to generate initial 3D points. Thesecond stage optimizes the position and normals of 3D points.

Nanostructure evolution during cluster growth: Ag on H-terminated Si (111) surfaces,JM Zuo; BQ Li,Abstract The size of small clusters has a large effect on cluster growth and structure. UsingAg clusters of sizes from∼ 1 to 10 nm grown on H-Si (111); we found that the clusterstructure evolves in stages showing (1) irregular shapes at coverage≤ 1 ML (monolayer);(2)mostly single crystal of faceted-hut-like shapes from 2 to 5 ML; and (3) defective disklikeislands above 5 ML. We show that the rapid coalescence of small clusters drives thenanostructure transition and leads to a steplike growth of nanoclusters that is different fromthe predictions of scaling theory.,Physical review letters,2002,57

Defect-mediated discrete solitons in optically induced photorefractive lattices,Yongyao Li; Wei Pang; Yongzhu Chen; Zhiqiang Yu; Jianying Zhou; Huarong Zhang,Abstract Theoretical analysis to the defect mediated discrete solitons in one-and two-dimensional periodical waveguide lattices is presented. The waveguide arrays with thesefunctional defects are assumed to respond to the light field as an optically inducedphotorefraction and they are patterned by a holographic technique. It is found that the spatialenergy distributions of the solitary waves can be controlled by the defects in the waveguidearrays; and this gives rise to an additional freedom to externally shaping the light fielddistribution to a special shape.,Physical Review A,2009,56
Theoretical elucidation of acetylating glycerol with acetic acid and acetic anhydride,Xiaoyuan Liao; Yulei Zhu; Sheng-Guang Wang; Hongmei Chen; Yongwang Li,Abstract Density functional theory calculations on level of B3LYP functional and 6-31G**basis set are carried out on glycerol esterification reactions. The most stable structures of thereactants; intermediates and products are located by considering a large amount ofconformers. The thermodynamics is discussed in terms of the calculated reaction Gibbs freeenergy. The glycerol esterification with acetic acid is found to be thermodynamically resisted;while its esterification with acetic anhydride is preferable with significantly exothermalproperty. This agrees well with experiments. The proposed process art has beenexperimentally and theoretically proved to be with low production costs and high headproduct selectivity.,Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,2010,54
Stability of β-Mo2C facets from ab initio atomistic thermodynamics,Tao Wang; Xingwu Liu; Shengguang Wang; Chunfang Huo; Yong-Wang Li; Jianguo Wang; Haijun Jiao,The stability of β-Mo2C surfaces has been computed at the level of density functional theoryunder the consideration of the temperature; pressure; and molar ratios of CH4/H2 andCO/CO2 gas mixtures by using ab initio atomistic thermodynamic calculations. It was foundthat the (001) surface is most stable at low temperature; whereas (101) becomes dominantat high temperature with CH4 as carbon source; and the computed surface stability issupported by the experimental X-ray diffraction pattern and intensity. For CO as carbonsource; the (101) surface has the smallest surface Gibbs free energy at temperatures up to1000 K and is most stable. On the basis of the Wulff-type particle shapes from surface Gibbsfree energies the (101) facet represents the largest surface area of β-Mo2C. Our findings arein perfect agreement with the results of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy.,The Journal of Physical Chemistry C,2011,53

Influence of scale-breaking phenomena on turbulent mixing rates,Erwin George; James Glimm; Xiaolin Li; Yuanhua Li; Xinfeng Liu,Abstract Simulations not seen before compare turbulent mixing rates for ideal fluids and forreal immiscible fluids with experimental values for the surface tension. The simulated realfluid mixing rates lie near the center of the range of experimental values. A comparison totheoretical predictions relating the mixing rate; the bubble width; and the bubble heightfluctuations based on bubble merger models shows good agreement with experiment. Theideal fluid mixing rate is some 50% larger; providing an example of the sensitivity of themixing rate to physical scale breaking interfacial phenomena; we also observe thissensitivity to numerical scale-breaking artifacts.,Physical Review E,2006,53
A nonstationary Poisson point process describes the sequence of action potentials over long time scales in lateral-superior-olive auditory neurons,Robert G Turcott; Steven B Lowen; Eric Li; Don H Johnson; Chiyeko Tsuchitani; Malvin C Teich,Abstract The behavior of lateral-superior-olive (LSO) auditory neurons over large time scaleswas investigated. Of particular interest was the determination as to whether LSO neuronsexhibit the same type of fractal behavior as that observed in primary VIII-nerve auditoryneurons. It has been suggested that this fractal behavior; apparent on long time scales; mayplay a role in optimally coding natural sounds. We found that a nonfractal model; thenonstationary dead-time-modified Poisson point process (DTMP); describes the LSO firingpatterns well for time scales greater than a few tens of milliseconds; a region where thespecific details of refractoriness are unimportant. The rate is given by the sum of twodecaying exponential functions. The process is completely specified by the initial values andtime constants of the two exponentials and by the dead-time relation.

Ab initio calculations of elastic constants and thermodynamic properties of Li2O for high temperatures and pressures,Xiao-Feng Li; Xiang-Rong Chen; Chuan-Min Meng; Guang-Fu Ji,Abstract The elastic constants and thermodynamic properties of Li 2 O for high temperaturesand pressures are calculated by the ab initio unrestricted Hartree–Fock (HF) linearcombination of atomic orbital (LCAO) periodic approach. The lattice constant; elasticconstants; Debye temperature; and thermal expansion coefficient obtained are in goodagreement with the available experimental data and other theoretical results. It is found thatat zero pressure the elastic constants C 11; C 12 and C 44; bulk modulus B and Debyetemperature Θ D decrease monotonically over the wide range of temperatures from 0 to1100 K. When the temperature T> 1100 K; C 12 approaches zero; consistently with thetransition temperature 1200 K. However; with increasing pressure; they all increasemonotonically and the anisotropy will weaken.,Solid state communications,2006,52

Determination of α-resolution in lattice-valued first-order logic LF (X),Yang Xu; Jun Liu; Da Ruan; Xiaobing Li,Abstract Key issues for resolution-based automated reasoning in lattice-valued first-orderlogic LF (X) are investigated with truth-values in a lattice-valued logical algebraic structure–lattice implication algebra (LIA). The determination of resolution at a certain truth-value level(called α-resolution) in LF (X) is proved to be equivalently transformed into the determinationof α-resolution in lattice-valued propositional logic LP (X) based on LIA. The determination ofα-resolution of any quasi-regular generalized literals and constants under various cases inLP (X) is further analyzed; specified; and subsequently verified. Hence the determination ofα-resolution in LF (X) can be accordingly solved to a very broad extent; which not only lays afoundation for the practical implementation of automated reasoning algorithms in LF (X); butalso provides a key support for α-resolution-based automated reasoning approaches and …,Information Sciences,2011,48

Glucose supplycannot meet demand and body fat is mobilized; potentially leading to negative energybalance (NEB); ketosis; or fatty liver. Propionate produces glucose by gluconeogenesis;which depends heavily on the number and species of microbes. In the present study; weanalyzed the rumen microbiome composition of cows in the transition period; cows withketosis; and nonperinatal cows by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism(TRFLP) analysis of 16S rRNA genes and quantitative PCR. TRFLP analysis indicated thatthe quantity of Veillonellaceae organisms was reduced and that of Streptococcaceaeorganisms was increased in rumen samples from the transition period and ketosis groups;with the number of Lactobacillaceae organisms increased after calving.

Dischargeswith Ohmic heating only and with additional ICR heating in the MW-range were producedover an extended range of plasma parameters. Different limiter materials were used—Inconel; stainless steel; graphite; TiC coated graphite. The surface of the first wall (liner)consisted either of Inconel or of a carbon layer deposited upon the Inconel. Characteristicfeatures of the discharge have been modified by making use of the modular pump limiterALT-I and by applying a localized perturbation coil for “ergodization” of the magnetic fieldstructure in the boundary. The characteristics of plasma-wall interaction under theseconditions and their influence on the global performance of the TEXTOR plasma are …,Journal of Nuclear Materials,1987,46

Siting of B; Al; Ga or Zn and bridging hydroxyl groups in mordenite: an ab initio study,Shuping Yuan; Jianguo Wang; Yongwang Li; Shaoyi Peng,Abstract The siting of B; Al; Ga or Zn and bridging OH groups in the framework of mordenitewas studied by ab initio Hartree–Fock MO methods. The basis set effect on the calculationresults was investigated in details. It was shown that heteroatoms including B; Al; Ga and Znprefer the same T sites; T 3 and T 4; when replacing Si in mordenite framework. Thepresence of the charge-balancing protons does not influence the siting sites of heteroatoms;but stabilizes the structure of the substituted clusters. For the two preferred substitution sitesT 3 and T 4; the charge-compensating protons prefer to attach to O 9 and O 10; respectively;in case of B; Al or Ga substitution. For Zn substitution at T 3 or T 4 site; the two charge-compensating protons favor bonding with O 9 and O 1 or O 10 and O 2; respectively.,Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical,2001,43

Binding of Sudan II and IV to lecithin liposomes and E. coli membranes: insights into the toxicity of hydrophobic azo dyes,Lu Li; Hong-Wen Gao; Jiao-Rong Ren; Ling Chen; Yu-Cheng Li; Jian-Fu Zhao; He-Ping Zhao; Yuan Yuan,Sudan red compounds are hydrophobic azo dyes; still used as food additives in somecountries. However; they have been shown to be unsafe; causing tumors in the liver andurinary bladder in rats. They have been classified as category 3 human carcinogens by theInternational Agency for Research on Cancer. A number of hypotheses that could explainthe mechanism of carcinogenesis have been proposed for dyes similar to the Sudan redcompounds. Traditionally; investigations of the membrane toxicity of organic substanceshave focused on hydrocarbons; eg polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); and DDT. Incontrast to hydrocarbons; Sudan red compounds contain azo and hydroxy groups; whichcan form hydrogen bonds with the polar head groups of membrane phospholipids. Thus;entry may be impeded.

Protective effect of Astragalus polysaccharides on ATP binding cassette transporter A1 in THP‐1 derived foam cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor‐alpha,Yan‐Fu Wang; Xiao‐Fang Yang; Bei Cheng; Chun‐Li Mei; Qing‐Xian Li; Hua Xiao; Qiu‐Tang Zeng; Yu‐Hua Liao; Kun Liu,Abstract Astragalus polysaccharide (APS); the main extract from the traditional Chinesemedicinal herb Astragalus membranaceus; has been reported to benefit the treatment ofimmune-inflammatory diseases and metabolic disorders. In atherosclerotic plaques;proinflammatory cytokines exert adverse effects on lipids thereby aggravatingatherosclerosis. Recent evidence shows that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) can down-regulate the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1); which plays a vitalrole in reverse cholesterol transport and determines the process of atherosclerosis. In thepresent study; the effects of APS on ABCA1 expression; cholesterol effluent rate and totalcholesterol content of THP-1 derived foam cells exposed to TNF-α were investigated.Compared with the foam cells exposed to TNF-α; ABCA1 expression was promoted in the …,Phytotherapy research,2010,40
A front tracking algorithm for limited mass diffusion,Xinfeng Liu; Yuanhua Li; James Glimm; XL Li,Abstract The advantage of front tracking over capturing methods for the numerical simulationof discontinuity surfaces in fluid flow is to eliminate the numerical diffusion of mass across afluid interface. For accurate modeling of an interface between miscible fluids; however;physical mass diffusion may be significant; and must be added to the calculation. The mainpurpose of this paper is to introduce a new front tracking algorithm in which the physicaldiffusion of mass across a tracked interface is included. The accuracy and convergenceproperties of this algorithm are discussed. The new algorithm is a subgrid algorithm in thesense that the asymptotic fine grid behavior is identical to conventional untracked(capturing) methods while the coarse grid behavior is improved. It is thus most suitable formodeling small values of physical mass diffusion; for which adequate numerical …,Journal of Computational Physics,2007,40

Modelling of hydrotreating catalysis based on the remote control: HYD and HDS,YW Li; Bernard Delmon,Abstract The remote control theory was used to construct a comprehensive kinetic model ofhydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrogenation (HYD) on sulfided catalysts. The work makesan attempt to reflect in a more precise way the structure of the active sites. By consideringavailable information on the HYD and HDS catalysis over promoted MoS 2 type catalysts;several new kinetic models were developed. They were inserted into a continuous stirredtank reactor (CSTR) model to simulate both the steady sates and the dynamic trends of thehydrodesulfurization and hydrogenation of model feeds represented by a mixture ofthiophene and unsaturated hydrocarbons. These trends are qualitatively compared with theexperimental observations in order to discriminate these slightly different models.

Adsorption equilibria of CO coverage on β-Mo2C surfaces,Tao Wang; Shengguang Wang; Yong-Wang Li; Jianguo Wang; Haijun Jiao,Adsorption and surface coverage of CO on the (001);(101); and (201) surfaces of β-Mo2Cwere computed at the level of density functional theory under the consideration of thetemperature and CO partial pressure by using the ab initio atomistic thermodynamic method.On the basis of the computed Gibbs free energies; the relationship between CO coverage onthe surfaces and temperature as well as CO partial pressure has been established; andexcellent agreements have been found between the predicated CO desorption temperaturesand the experimentally recorded temperature programmed desorption (TPD) spectra. Thesecomputed phase diagrams show that a stable CO coverage can be obtained within a rangeof temperature and partial pressure; different surfaces can have different coverage at thesame conditions; and different partial pressure has a different desorption temperature.

Arrayed and checkerboard optical waveguides controlled by the electromagnetically induced transparency,Yongyao Li; Boris A Malomed; Mingneng Feng; Jianying Zhou,Abstract We introduce two models of quasidiscrete optical systems: an array of waveguidesdoped by four-level N-type atoms; and a nonlinear checkerboard pattern; formed by dopingwith three-level atoms of the Λ-type. The dopant atoms are driven by external fields; toinduce the effect of the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). These activesystems offer advantages and additional degrees of freedom; in comparison with ordinarypassive waveguiding systems.

Thesystem may be realized as a set of 𝒫𝒯-symmetric dual-core waveguides embedded into aphotonic crystal. The system supports 𝒫𝒯-symmetric and antisymmetric fundamentalsolitons (FSs) and on-site-centered solitary vortices (OnVs). Stability of these discretesolitons is the central topic of the consideration. Their stability regions in the underlyingparameter space are identified through the computation of stability eigenvalues; and verifiedby direct simulations. Symmetric FSs represent the system's ground state; being stable atlowest values of the power; while anti-symmetric FSs and OnVs are stable at higher powers.Symmetric OnVs; which are also stable at lower powers; are remarkably robust modes: on …,Optics express,2014,34
Cyclonic-static micro-bubble flotation column,Haijun Zhang; Jiongtian Liu; Yongtian Wang; Yijun Cao; Zilong Ma; Xiaobing Li,Abstract A cyclonic-static micro-bubble flotation column (FCSMC) was developed for mineralseparation; particularly for whole flotation circuits. The FCSMC featured multiplemineralisation steps; including countercurrent mineralisation; cyclone mineralisation andpipe flow mineralisation in a single column; through which the mineralisation energy;mineralisation rate and dynamic turbulence intensity gradually increased to compensate forthe decrease in the floatability of mineral particles. It thus led to highly efficient mineralisationas well as a sufficient retention time fine mineral recovery. The usability and performance ofthe FCSMC was assessed and further confirmed by lab-; pilot-and industrial-scale unitsbased on magnetite ore. The iron concentrate grade reached 69% with a recovery of 95%.,Minerals Engineering,2013,34
Study of manganese promoter on a precipitated iron-based catalyst for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis,Zhichao Tao; Yong Yang; Chenghua Zhang; Tingzhen Li; Mingyue Ding; Hongwei Xiang; Yongwang Li,Abstract The effects of Manganese (Mn) incorporation on a precipitated iron-based Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) catalyst were investigated using N 2 physical adsorption; airdifferential thermal analysis (DTA); H 2 temperature-programmed reduction (TPR); andMössbauer spectroscopy. The FTS performances of the catalysts were tested in a slurryphase reactor. The characterization results indicated that Mn increased the surface area ofthe catalyst; and improved the dispersion of α-Fe 2 O 3 and reduced its crystallite size as aresult of the high dispersion effect of Mn and the Fe-Mn interaction. The Fe-Mn interactionalso suppressed the reduction of α-Fe 2 O 3 to Fe 3 O 4; stabilized the FeO phase; and (or)decreased the carburization degree of the catalysts in the H 2 and syngas reductionprocesses. In addition; incorporated Mn decreased the initial catalyst activity; but …,Journal of Natural Gas Chemistry,2007,34

On the Mo-terminated surface; NO decomposes intosurface N and O; and NO 2 dissociates into surface O and NO without any barriers; while themost stable adsorption modes of pyridine and pyrrole have π-face coordination over thethree-fold molybdenum hollow sites with strongly destroyed aromatic systems. On the C-terminated surface; adsorbed surface species have been found for NO and NO 2; whiledestroyed ring systems are found for pyridine and pyrrole. It is found that adsorption on theMo-terminated surface is much stronger than that on the C-terminated surface.,Surface science,2007,34
Simulation of parachute FSI using the front tracking method,Joung-Dong Kim; Yan Li; Xiaolin Li,Abstract We use the front tracking method on a spring system to model the dynamicevolution of parachute canopy and risers. The canopy surface and the riser string chord of aparachute are represented by a triangulated surface mesh with preset equilibrium length oneach side of the simplices. The stretching and wrinkling of the canopy and its supportingstring chords (risers) are modeled by the spring system. The spring constants of the canopyand the risers are chosen based on the analysis of Young's surface modulus for the canopyfabric and Young's string modulus of the string chord. Damping is added to dissipate theexcessive spring internal energy. The current model does not have radial reinforcementcables and has not taken into account the canopy porosity. This mechanical structure iscoupled with the incompressible Navier–Stokes solver through the “Impulse Method”. We …,Journal of Fluids and Structures,2013,33

Density Functional Theory Study on Surface C x H y Formation from CO Activation on Fe3C (100),Li-Juan Deng; Chun-Fang Huo; Xing-Wu Liu; Xun-Hua Zhao; Yong-Wang Li; Jianguo Wang; Haijun Jiao,Spin-polarized density functional theory calculations have been performed to investigate themechanisms for C x H y formation on Fe3C (100). It is found that H-assisted CO dissociation(CO+ H→ CHO; CHO→ CH+ O) has lower barrier than CO direct dissociation (CO→ C+ O);but surface Cs atom hydrogenation to form surface CsH is the most favored pathway. As thefirst C2 surface species; surface ketenylidene CsCO rising from CO adsorption is animportant intermediate for C2H x formation. Initial surface C2H x forms from CsCOhydrogenation instead of direct dissociation. The formation of CsCH; CsHCH and CsH2CHhas close effective barriers and depends on the CO/H2 ratio. In addition; surface vacancycan activate CO strongly and lower the CO dissociation barrier considerably; and thisregenerates the carburized active surface and closes a catalytic cycle.,The Journal of Physical Chemistry C,2010,33

Effect of Mo addition on precipitated Fe catalysts for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis,Shaodong Qin; Chenghua Zhang; Jian Xu; Baoshao Wu; Hongwei Xiang; Yongwang Li,Abstract Effects of Mo addition on the performance of precipitated Fe catalysts for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) were studied in a slurry reactor at 280° C; 1.5 MPa; 2000 h− 1; andsyngas H 2/CO= 1.2. The catalysts were characterized by N 2 adsorption; H 2 or COtemperature programmed reduction (TPR); NH 3 temperature programmed desorption(TPD); X-ray diffraction (XRD); and Mössbauer effect spectroscopy (MES). It was found thatthere is a strong interaction between Fe and Mo; which inhibited the reduction andcarburization of Fe catalyst. The surface acidity of the catalysts was also found to increasewith addition of molybdenum. In the FTS process; Mo addition decreased the FTS activity ofFe catalyst; markedly enhanced C 12+ hydrocarbon selectivity; while suppressed C 2–C 8hydrocarbon selectivity as validated by non-ASF product distribution curves.,Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical,2009,29

Antimony (Sb) is a toxic element used in semiconductor components and flameretardants for circuit board within electronic equipment. When e-waste is recycled; Sb isreleased and contaminates the surrounding environment; however; few studies havecharacterized the extent of this problem. In this study; we investigated Sb and arsenic (As)distributions in indoor dust from 13 e-waste recycling villages in Guiyu; GuangdongProvince; southeastern China. Results revealed significantly elevated concentrations of Sb(6.1–232 mg/kg) in dust within all villages; which were 3.9–147 times higher than those fromthe non e-waste sites; indicating e-waste recycling was an important source of Sb pollution.On the contrary; As concentrations (5.4–17.7 mg/kg) in e-waste dusts were similar to …,Science of the Total Environment,2011,28
Mechanistic insight into the heterogeneous catalytic transfer hydrogenation over Cu/Al2O3: Direct evidence for the assistant role of support,Long Huang; Yulei Zhu; Chunfang Huo; Hongyan Zheng; Gang Feng; Chenghua Zhang; Yongwang Li,Abstract The catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) between alcohol and alkene wasinvestigated over Cu/Al 2 O 3 catalyst via mechanical mixture of the supported catalyst andthe pure support. It is found that the CTH activities are highly depended on the amount andacid/basic properties of the mechanically mixed support; clearly indicating the assistant roleof support. In addition; only alkene with high activity of hydrogenation can really act ashydrogen acceptor. Based on these; a new bifunctional reaction pathway is proposed.Alcohol dehydrogenates to form alkoxide on Al 2 O 3 surface (R 1 CH (OH) R 2→ R 1 CH(O) R 2+ H); and H atom migrates to the metallic Cu patches via reverse hydrogen spillover;while extraction of α-hydrogen forming ketone (R 1 CH (O) R 2→ R 1 C (O) R 2+ H) occurson Cu or Cu–Al 2 O 3 interface. On the metallic Cu patches; alkene hydrogenates yielding …,Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical,2008,28
Effect of SiO2 content on iron-based catalysts for slurry Fischer–Tropsch synthesis,Wenjuan Hou; Baoshan Wu; Yong Yang; Qinglan Hao; Lei Tian; Hongwei Xiang; Yongwang Li,Abstract A study has been carried out to investigate the effects of binder SiO 2 content oncatalytic behavior of spray-dried precipitated Fe/Cu/K/SiO 2 catalysts for Fischer–Tropschsynthesis (FTS). The catalysts were characterized by means of N 2 physisorption; H 2temperature-programmed reduction (TPR); scanning electron microscopy (SEM); andMössbauer effect spectroscopy (MES). The Fischer–Tropsch synthesis performances(activity; selectivity and stability) of the catalysts were studied in a slurry-phase continuouslystirred tank reactor (CSTR). The results indicated that the increase of SiO 2 content stabilizesFe 3 O 4 phase and suppresses the further reduction and carburization of the catalysts insyngas. Long time on stream FTS performances showed that the catalyst with SiO 2improves its reaction stability. The selectivities to light hydrocarbons (methane; C 2–C 4 …,Fuel Processing Technology,2008,28
The Arrhenius equation as a model for explaining plant responses to temperature and water stresses,YONGSHENG FENG; XIAOMET LI; LARRY BOERSMA,Abstract The Arrhenius equation describes the response of biological processes totemperature. This study was conducted to examine the applicability of the Arrheniusequation to whole plant processes and to explore the application of the Arrhenius equationas a basis for characterizing plant responses to water stress. Rates of growth of leaf areaand shoot dry mass of spring wheat seedlings were measured at combinations of five soilwater potentials (− 0.03;− 0.06;− 0.10;− 0.17 and− 0.25 MPa) and seven root temperatures(12; 14; 17; 22; 27; 29 and 32° C). A non-linear least square procedure was used to fit themodified Arrhenius equation to experimental observations. Adequate distribution ofexperimental observations with respect to temperature reduces the uncertainties inparameter evaluations.

Discrete solitons and scattering of lattice waves in guiding arrays with a nonlinear PT-symmetric defect,Xiangyu Zhang; Jinglei Chai; Jiasheng Huang; Zhiqiang Chen; Yongyao Li; Boris A Malomed,Discrete fundamental and dipole solitons are constructed; in an exact analytical form; in anarray of linear waveguides with an embedded PT-symmetric dimer; which is composed oftwo nonlinear waveguides carrying equal gain and loss. Fundamental solitons in tightly knitlattices; as well as all dipole modes; exist above a finite threshold value of the total power.However; the threshold vanishes for fundamental solitons in loosely knit lattices. The stabilityof the discrete solitons is investigated analytically by means of the Vakhitov-Kolokolov (VK)criterion; and; in the full form; via the computation of eigenvalues for perturbation modes.Fundamental and dipole solitons tend to be stable at smaller and larger values of the totalpower (norm); respectively. The increase of the strength of the coupling between the twodefect-forming sites leads to strong expansion of the stability areas. The scattering …,Optics express,2014,27
Matter-wave solitons supported by field-induced dipole-dipole repulsion with spatially modulated strength,Yongyao Li; Jingfeng Liu; Wei Pang; Boris A Malomed,Abstract We demonstrate the existence of one-and two-dimensional (1D and 2D;respectively) bright solitons in the Bose-Einstein condensate with repulsive dipole-dipoleinteractions induced by a combination of dc and ac polarizing fields; oriented perpendicularto the plane in which the BEC is trapped; assuming that the strength of the fields grows in theradial (r) direction faster than r 3. Stable tightly confined 1D and 2D fundamental solitons;twisted solitons in 1D; and solitary vortices in 2D are found in a numerical form. Thefundamental solitons remain robust under the action of an expulsive potential; which isinduced by the interaction of the dipoles with the polarizing field. The confinement andscaling properties of the soliton families are explained analytically. The Thomas-Fermiapproximation is elaborated for fundamental solitons.

Distribution; sources and health risk assessment of mercury in kindergarten dust,Guangyi Sun; Zhonggen Li; Xiangyang Bi; Yupeng Chen; Shuangfang Lu; Xin Yuan,Abstract Mercury (Hg) contamination in urban area is a hot issue in environmental research.In this study; the distribution; sources and health risk of Hg in dust from 69 kindergartens inWuhan; China; were investigated. In comparison with most other cities; the concentrations oftotal mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) were significantly elevated; ranging from0.15 to 10.59 mg kg− 1 and from 0.64 to 3.88 μg kg− 1; respectively. Among the five differenturban areas; the educational area had the highest concentrations of THg and MeHg. TheGIS mapping was used to identify the hot-spot areas and assess the potential pollutionsources of Hg. The emissions of coal-power plants and coking plants were the main sourcesof THg in the dust; whereas the contributions of municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills andiron and steel smelting related industries were not significant.

Kinetic Model of Product Distribution over Fe Catalyst for Fischer− Tropsch Synthesis,Rongle Zhang; Jie Chang; Yuanyuan Xu; Liren Cao; Yongwang Li; Jinglai Zhou,A new kinetic model of the Fischer− Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is proposed to describe the non-Anderson− Schulz− Flory (ASF) product distribution. The model is based on the double-polymerization monomers hypothesis; in which the surface C2* species acts as a chain-growth monomer in the light-product range; while C1* species acts as a chain-growthmonomer in the heavy-product range. The detailed kinetic model in the Langmuir−Hinshelwood− Hougen− Watson type based on the elementary reactions is derived for FTSand the water− gas-shift reaction. Kinetic model candidates are evaluated by minimization ofmultiresponse objective functions with a genetic algorithm approach. The model ofhydrocarbon product distribution is consistent with experimental data (< C45). The newmodel gives a sound interpretation of the experimental data.,Energy & Fuels,2009,27
Adsorption and Dissociation of CO as Well as CH x Coupling and Hydrogenation on the Clean and Oxygen Pre-covered Co (0001) Surfaces,Chun-Fang Huo; Yong-Wang Li; Jianguo Wang; Haijun Jiao,Spin-polarized density functional theory calculations were performed to investigate theoxidation of the Co (0001) surface and the effects of surface O on CO adsorption anddissociation as well as CH x coupling and hydrogenation. Under the realistic Fischer−Tropsch synthesis conditions (493 K; P H2O/P H2= 1− 1.5); Co (0001) can be oxidized byH2O forming a 1/4 monolayer O-covered surface; while subsurface oxidation or highoxidized surface (1/2 monolayer) is thermodynamically not possible. Compared to clean Co(0001); the oxygen pre-covered surface lowers the ability for CO adsorption and activation;elevates the CO dissociation barrier; and favors CO2 formation; as well as elevates theCH/CH coupling barrier and favors the CH hydrogenation thermodynamically.Consequently; the catalytic activity is reduced; and the monomeric building block for …,The Journal of Physical Chemistry C,2008,27
Effect of manganese on a potassium-promoted iron-based Fischer-Tropsch synthesis catalyst,Zhichao Tao; Yong Yang; Haijun Wan; Tingzhen Li; Xia An; Hongwei Xiang; Yongwang Li,Abstract The effects of manganese promoter on the reduction–carburization behavior;surface basicity; bulk phase structure and their correlation with Fischer-Tropsch synthesis(FTS) performances have been emphatically studied over a series of spray-dried Fe–Mn–Kcatalysts with a wide range of Mn incorporation amount. The catalysts were characterized bymeans of H 2 and CO temperature-programmed reduction (TPR); CO 2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD); Mössbauer spectroscopy etc.. The results indicated thatsmall amount of Mn promoter can promote the reduction of the catalyst in H 2. However; FeOphase formed during reduction is stabilized by MnO phase with the further increase of Mncontent; making FeO phase difficult to be reduced in H 2. The addition of Mn promoter canstabilize the Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ ions; and suppresses the reduction and carburization of the …,Catalysis letters,2007,27

Two-dimensional solitons in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates with spin-orbit coupling,Xunda Jiang; Zhiwei Fan; Zhaopin Chen; Wei Pang; Yongyao Li; Boris A Malomed,Abstract We report families of two-dimensional (2D) composite solitons in spinor dipolarBose-Einstein condensates; with two localized components linearly mixed by the spin-orbitcoupling (SOC); and the intrinsic nonlinearity represented by the dipole-dipole interaction(DDI) between atomic magnetic moments polarized in plane by an external magnetic field.Recently; stable solitons were predicted in the form of semivortices (composites built ofcoupled fundamental and vortical components) in the 2D system combining the SOC andcontact attractive interactions. Replacing the latter by the anisotropic long-range DDI; wedemonstrate that; for a fixed norm of the soliton; the system supports a continuous family ofstable spatially asymmetric vortex solitons (AVSs); parameterized by an offset of the pivot ofthe vortical component relative to its fundamental counterpart. The offset is limited by a …,Physical Review A,2016,25

The influence of the Gd 3+doping content on the crystal structure and the electrical properties of GDC were examined.Many analysis techniques such as thermal analysis; X-ray diffraction; nitrogen adsorptionanalysis; scanning electron microscopy and AC impedance analysis were employed tocharacterize the GDC powders. The crystallization of the GDC solid solution occurred below350° C. The GDC powders calcined at 800° C showed a typical cubic fluorite structure. Thelattice parameter of GDC exhibited a linear relationship with the Gd 3+ content. As comparedwith that sintered at other temperatures; the GDC pellet that sintered at 1300° C had a highrelative density of 97%; and showed finer microstructure.

Reactivity of surface OH in CH4 reforming reactions on Ni (1 1 1): A density functional theory calculation,Sheng-Guang Wang; Dong-Bo Cao; Yong-Wang Li; Jianguo Wang; Haijun Jiao,Abstract The reactivity of surface OH in CH 4 reforming reactions was investigated by usingdensity functional theory calculation. The key reaction pathway from CH 4 into syngas bysurface OH follows CH 4→ CH→ CHOH→ CHO→ CO; which is similar with the pathwayinduced by surface O in CO 2 reforming of CH 4 (CH 4→ CH→ CHO→ CO). Surface OHdecreases the possibility of CH dehydrogenation into surface carbon. Compared to surfaceO and OH; surface H can eliminate surface carbon deposition more efficiently.,Surface Science,2009,24
LDFT-based watermarking resilient to local desynchronization attacks,Huawei Tian; Yao Zhao; Rongrong Ni; Lunming Qin; Xuelong Li,Up to now; a watermarking scheme that is robust against desynchronization attacks (DAs) isstill a grand challenge. Most image watermarking resynchronization schemes in literaturecan survive individual global DAs (eg; rotation; scaling; translation; and other affinetransforms); but few are resilient to challenging cropping and local DAs. The main reason isthat robust features for watermark synchronization are only globally invariable rather thanlocally invariable. In this paper; we present a blind image watermarking resynchronizationscheme against local transform attacks. First; we propose a new feature transform namedlocal daisy feature transform (LDFT); which is not only globally but also locally invariable.Then; the binary space partitioning (BSP) tree is used to partition the geometrically invariantLDFT space. In the BSP tree; the location of each pixel is fixed under global transform …,IEEE transactions on cybernetics,2013,23
Relaxor-and phase-transition-like behaviors in ZnO single crystals at high temperatures,LN Liu; CC Wang; CM Lei; T Li; GJ Wang; XH Sun; J Wang; SG Huang; YD Li; H Wang,We herein reported the dielectric properties of ZnO single crystals; and three dielectricanomalies were found. The first anomaly shows a relaxor-like behavior. It is composed oftwo oxygen-vacancy-related relaxation processes: a dipolar relaxation related to thehopping motions of single-ionized oxygen vacancies and a Maxwell-Wagner relaxation asthe defects were blocked by the interfaces of sample/electrode contacts. The secondanomaly behaves as a phase-transition-like behavior. It is ascribed to the distribution statetransition for oxygen vacancies from static disorder to dynamic disorder. The third anomalyexhibits a relaxor-like behavior. It is an artificial effect caused by negative capacitance.,Applied Physics Letters,2013,23

Translational regulation by the 3′ untranslated region of the dengue type 2 virus genome,Yan Wei; Chengfeng Qin; Tao Jiang; Xiaofeng Li; Hui Zhao; Zhongyu Liu; Yongqiang Deng; Ran Liu; Shuiping Chen; Man Yu; Ede Qin,The role of the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the dengue virus (DENV) genome duringviral translation remains to be elucidated. We assessed the contribution of well-defined RNAelements in the 3′ UTR of DENV-2 to viral translation using a virus-induced reporting genesystem and deoxyribozymes (DRzs) targeting the 3′ UTR of the DENV-2 genome. Resultsshow that mRNAs carrying a deletion of repeated conserved sequence (RCS2)-CS2 aretranslated less efficiently than wild type mRNAs. However; mRNAs with a deletion of CS1-stem loop (SL) are translated more efficiently. Thus; CS1-SL and RCS2-CS2 may havedifferent effects on translational regulation. Additionally; the translation-suppressing effect ofCS1-SL or the SL element is further confirmed in DENV-2-infected cells using DRzs.Mutagenesis studies show that; rather than the secondary structure; nucleotides 10663 …,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,2009,23

Isolation and identification of eukaryotic initiation factor 4A as a molecular target for the marine natural product Pateamine A,Woon‐Kai Low; Yongjun Dang; Tilman Schneider‐Poetsch; Zonggao Shi; Nam Song Choi; Robert M Rzasa; Helene A Shea; Shukun Li; Kaapjoo Park; Gil Ma; Daniel Romo; Jun O Liu,Abstract Natural products continue to demonstrate their utility both as therapeutics and asmolecular probes for the discovery and mechanistic deconvolution of various cellularprocesses. However; this utility is dampened by the inherent difficulties involved in isolatingand characterizing new bioactive natural products; in obtaining sufficient quantities ofpurified compound for further biological studies; and in developing bioactive probes. Key tocharacterizing the biological activity of natural products is the identification of the moleculartarget (s) within the cell. The marine sponge‐derived natural product Pateamine A (PatA)has been found to be an inhibitor of eukaryotic translation initiation. Herein; we describe themethods utilized for identification of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) asone of the primary protein targets of PatA.

Symmetry breaking in dipolar matter-wave solitons in dual-core couplers,Yongyao Li; Jingfeng Liu; Wei Pang; Boris A Malomed,Abstract We study the effects of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in solitonscomposed of a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate trapped in a dual-core system with dipole-dipole interactions (DDIs) and hopping between the cores. Two realizations of such a matter-wave coupler are introduced: weakly and strongly coupled. The former is based on twoparallel pipe-shaped traps; whereas the latter is represented by a single pipe sliced by anexternal field into parallel layers. The dipoles are oriented along the axes of the pipes. Inthese systems; the dual-core solitons feature SSB of the supercritical and subcritical types;respectively.

Electronic and dynamical properties of NiAl studied from first principles,Hongzhi Fu; XiaoFeng Li; WenFang Liu; Yanming Ma; Tao Gao; Xinhua Hong,Abstract The electronic structural and dynamical properties of NiAl have been studied usingdensity functional theory and Debye model. The obtained pressure/temperaturedependence on the V/V 0 and lattice parameter; agrees with the available experimental andother theoretical data. The results show that the ratio of Debye temperature (θ p/θ 0);velocities of longitudinal and transverse wave (V l [100]; V l [110]; VT 1 [001] and VT 1 [010]);anisotropy factors (A [001];(100) and A [001];(110)); Young's modulus (Y [111]) andPoisson's ratios (σ [111] and σ [001]) increase with pressure; while the transverse wavevelocity (VT 2 [1− 10]); Young's modulus (Y [001]) and axis compressibility decrease withpressure.

ROSINA (RSI) is part of a CACTA transposable element; TamRSI; and links flower development to transposon activity,Mario Roccaro; Yubin Li; Hans Sommer; Heinz Saedler,Abstract ROSINA (RSI) was isolated as a DNA binding factor able to bind to the CArG-boxpresent in the promoter of the MADS-box gene DEFICIENS of Antirrhinum majus. Themosaic nature of RSI and its multi-copy presence in the A. majus genome indicated that RSIcould be a part of a mobile genetic element. Here we show that RSI is a part of a CACTAtransposable element system of A. majus; named TamRSI; which has evolved and is stillevolving within the terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) of this CACTA transposon. Interestingly;RSI is always found in opposite orientation with respect to the transcription of a second genepresent within the CACTA transposon; which encodes a putative TRANSPOSASE (TNP).This structural configuration has not yet been described for any member of the CACTAtransposons superfamily.

Double symmetry breaking of solitons in one-dimensional virtual photonic crystals,Yongyao Li; Boris A Malomed; Mingneng Feng; Jianying Zhou,Abstract We demonstrate that spatial solitons undergo two consecutive spontaneoussymmetry breakings (SSBs); with the increase of the total power; in nonlinear photoniccrystals (PhCs) built as arrays of alternating linear and nonlinear stripes; in the case whenthe maxima of the effective refractive index coincide with the minima of the self-focusingcoefficient and vice versa (ie; the corresponding linear and nonlinear periodic potentials arein competition). This setting may be induced; as a virtual PhC; by means of theelectromagnetically induced-transparency (EIT) technique; in a uniform optical medium.

Ultralow specific on-resistance superjunction vertical DMOS with high-$ K $ dielectric pillar,Xiaorong Luo; YH Jiang; K Zhou; P Wang; XW Wang; Q Wang; GL Yao; B Zhang; ZJ Li,A superjunction (SJ) VDMOS with a high-k (HK) dielectric pillar below the trench gate isproposed and investigated by simulation. The HK dielectric causes a self-adapted assistantdepletion of the n pillar. This not only increases the n-pillar doping concentration and thusreduces the specific on-resistance (R on; sp) but also alleviates the charge-imbalance issuein SJ devices. The HK dielectric weakens the lateral field and enhances the vertical fieldstrength in a high-voltage blocking state; leading to an improved breakdown voltage (BV).Ion implantation through trench sidewalls forms narrow and highly doped n pillars to furtherreduce the R on; sp. The R on; sp decreases by 42%; and BV increases by 15% comparedwith those of a conventional SJ VDMOS.,IEEE Electron Device Letters,2012,20
The transmission of quasi-discrete solitons in resonant waveguide arrays activated by the electromagnetically induced transparency,Jianxiong Wu; Mingneng Feng; Wei Pang; Shenhe Fu; Yongyao Li,We introduce a model of resonant optical systems: a waveguide array doped periodicallywith resonant four-level N-type atoms. The dopant atoms are driven by external fields whichinduce the effect of the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). In this resonantwaveguide arrays (RWA) system; the optical field propagates as quasi-discrete diffraction;breathing beam or stable spatial soliton when different initial amplitude and width of theprobe are given. The critical values representing these transformations are obtained by thenumerical simulations. In a further study of the oblique incidence; the soliton loses a portionof its energy while a kick (ie; a transverse wave vector) is initially introduced. As the value ofthe kick becomes larger than a critical value; the soliton collapses.,Journal of Nonlinear Optical Physics & Materials,2011,20
A general texture mapping framework for image-based 3D modeling,Lin Xu; Eric Li; Jianguo Li; Yurong Chen; Yimin Zhang,This paper presents a general texture mapping framework for image-based 3D modeling. Itaims to generating seamless texture map for 3D model created by real-world photos underuncontrolled environment. Our proposed method addresses two challenging problems: 1)texture discontinuity due to system error in 3D modeling from self-calibration; 2)color/lighting difference among images due to real-world uncontrolled environments. Thegeneral framework contains two stages to resolve these problems. The first stage globallyoptimizes the registration of texture patches and triangle faces with Markov Random Field(MRF) to optimize texture mosaic. The second stage does local radiometric correction toadjust color difference between texture patches and then blend texture boundaries toimprove color continuity.

Genome-wide expression profiling of RNA interference of hepatitis B virus gene expression and replication,Y Li; S Wasser; SG Lim; TMC Tan,Abstract Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been used repeatedly to down-regulate viralgene expression and inhibit viral replication in mammalian cells. In this study; we showedthat siRNAs specific for two conserved regions within the hepatitis BS antigen (HBsAg) genecan inhibit antigen production in two human liver cell lines which constitutively produce andsecrete HBsAg. The inhibitory effect was concentration dependent for both PLC/PRF/5 and2.2. 15 cells. Decreases in the corresponding viral transcript levels were observed. Theinhibitory effect was observed within 24 h and was still evident 7 days after the initialtreatment with siRNA. A significant reduction in virion production was also observed for the2.2. 15 cells. A critical consideration in this study was the specificity of the siRNA-mediatedinhibition. To address this; we first examined the effects on cell growth and viability.

Implementation of H. 264 encoder on general-purpose processors with hyper-threading technology,Eric Q Li; Yen-Kuang Chen,H. 264 is the emerging video coding standard; which aims at compressing high-quality videocontents at low bit-rates. While its new encoding and decoding processes are similar tomany previous standards; the new standard includes a number of new features and thusrequires much more computation than most existing standards do. The complexity of H. 264standard poses a large amount of challenges to implementing the encoder/decoder in real-time via software on personal computers. Even after 2~ 3x performance improvement withmedia instruction on modern general-purpose processors and another 2~ 4x improvementfrom algorithmic optimization; the H. 264 encoder is still too complicated to be implementedin real-time on a single processor.

The glass transition of Pd40Ni10Cu30P20 studied by temperature-modulated calorimetry,X Hu; TB Tan; Y Li; G Wilde; JH Perepezko,Abstract The frequency dependence of the heat capacity in the glass-transition region of Pd40 Ni 10 Cu 30 P 20 was studied by temperature-modulated differential scanningcalorimetry (TMDSC) during slow heating and cooling. Such data for low frequenciesbetween 0.1 and 0.01 Hz are not available; especially for metallic glasses. A crossoverbetween mixed static/dynamic and purely dynamic response signals was observed for thelowest frequencies between 1/80 and 1/100 s− 1; which allows a direct determination of theaverage relaxation time at a given cooling rate during the static glass transition. Further;these results were used to evaluate the experimental parameters necessary to truly separatethe static and dynamic response in low-frequency modulation calorimetry experiments toobtain the moduli of the dynamic specific heat.,Journal of non-crystalline solids,1999,20

An LTPS TFT demodulator for RFID tags embeddable on panel displays,Yueh-Hua Yu; Yuan-Jiang Lee; Yu-Hsuan Li; Chung-Hung Kuo; Chun-Huai Li; Yao-Jen Hsieh; Chun-Ting Liu; Yi-Jan Emery Chen,This paper presents an amplitude-shift-keying (ASK) demodulator for RF identification tags;which can be embedded on panel displays. The ASK demodulator was implemented in 3-mum low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) thin-film transistor (TFT) technology.Since the threshold voltages of LTPS TFTs are higher than CMOS transistors; theconventional demodulator implementation will degrade the demodulator sensitivitysignificantly. The novel full-wave demodulator circuit was proposed to resolve the issue ofhigh threshold voltage and reduce the ripples of the demodulated envelope. Operated at 8V; the demodulator consumes 1.6 mW of power. The input carrier frequency was tested up to13.56 MHz; and the highest ASK modulated data rate is 100 kb/s. The circuit size of theLTPS TFT demodulator is 500 mum times 450 mum.,IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques,2009,19

DFT Studies of CO Adsorption and Activation on Some Transition Metal Surfaces,Ling Jiang; Gui-Chang Wang; Nai-Jia Guan; Yang Wu; Zun-Sheng Cai; Yin-Ming Pan; Xue-Zhuang Zhao; Wei Huang; Yong-Wang Li; Yu-Han Sun; Bing Zhong,The difference in adsorption for CO on the M (100)(M= Cu; Ag; Au; Pd; Pt) surfaces has beensystematically investigated by first-principle density functional theory. The results indicatethat the chemisorption of CO on these transition metal surfaces belongs to non-dissociativeadsorption. The increased theoretical CO bond length of 0.1154~ 0.1161 nm (compared to0.1128 nm in the gas phase) demonstrates the activation of the CO bond. We have carriedout binding energy analysis; a natural bond orbital analysis and Mülliken populationanalysis of CO/M (100) adsorption systems. It can be concluded from the analyzed resultsthat the adsorbability of CO decreases in the order of Pd (100); Pt (100); Cu (100); Ag (100)and Au (100). We have also discussed the implications of these results in terms of thecatalysis of the water gas shift (WGS) reaction. From the volcano-shaped relationship …,Acta Physicochimica Sinica,2003,19
Prediction of surface mobility of a finite plate with uniform force excitation by structural intensity,YJ Li; JCS Lai,Abstract The prediction of the surface mobility of a finite plate by the structural intensity usingfinite element analysis (FEA) has been investigated. The formulation of the structuralintensity in a thin plate was first introduced. Then the structural intensity vectors and rmsvelocity distributions of a simply-supported thin finite plate have been determined using finiteelement harmonic response analysis for three excitation conditions: point force excitationwith an attached damper but without structural damping; point force excitation with structuraldamping and force excitation over a finite area with structural damping. Although the rmsvelocity distributions give some indication of the vibration mode at a particular frequency; thestructural intensity vectors reveal the power flow pattern. Finally the surface mobility of asimply-supported thin finite plate due to force excitation over a finite area with structural …,Applied Acoustics,2000,19

IBP-mediated suppression of autophagy promotes growth and metastasis of breast cancer cells via activating mTORC2/Akt/FOXO3a signaling pathway,S Chen; Q Han; X Wang; M Yang; Z Zhang; P Li; A Chen; C Hu; S Li,Abstract Interferon regulatory factor-4 binding protein (IBP) is a novel upstream activator ofRho GTPases. Our previous studies have shown that ectopic expression of IBP wascorrelated with malignant behaviors of human breast cancer cells; and invasive humanbreast cancer had high expression of IBP that promoted the proliferation of these cells.However; it remains unknown whether autophagy inhibition contributes to IBP-mediatedtumorigenesis. In this study; we for the first time; reported that upregulation of IBP expressionsignificantly suppressed the autophagy of breast cancer cells; and downregulation of IBPexpression markedly induced autophagy of these cells. Further investigation revealed thatIBP effectively counteracted autophagy by directly activating mammalian target of rapamycincomplex 2 (mTORC2) and upregulating phosphorylation of Akt on ser473 and FOXO3a …,Cell death & disease,2013,17
Quasicompactons in inverted nonlinear photonic crystals,Yongyao Li; Boris A Malomed; Jianxiong Wu; Wei Pang; Sicong Wang; Jianying Zhou,Abstract We study large-amplitude one-dimensional solitary waves in photonic crystalsfeaturing competition between linear and nonlinear lattices; with minima of the linearpotential coinciding with maxima of the nonlinear pseudopotential; and vice versa (invertednonlinear photonic crystals; INPCs); in the case of the saturable self-focusing nonlinearity.Such crystals were recently fabricated using a mixture of SU-8 and Rhodamine-B opticalmaterials. By means of numerical methods and analytical approximations; we find that large-amplitude solitons are broad sharply localized stable pulses (quasicompactons; QCs). Withthe increase of the total power; P; the QC's centroid performs multiple switchings betweenminima and maxima of the linear potential. Unlike cubic INPCs; the large-amplitude solitonsare mobile in the medium with the saturable nonlinearity. The threshold value of the kick …,Physical Review A,2011,17
Light propagation in a resonantly absorbing waveguide array,Mingneng Feng; Yikun Liu; Yongyao Li; Xiangsheng Xie; Jianying Zhou,Light propagation behavior in a resonantly absorbing waveguide array is analyzed. Both aLorentzian line shape and an inhomogeneous broadened absorbing line shape areconsidered; with their imaginary and real part of the refractive index determined by aKramers–Kronig relationship. The diffracted wave is shown to have the frequency spectradetermined by the material absorption; dispersion as well as the waveguide structure. Aninteresting phenomenon is that a spectral hole is produced and becomes deeper in thediffraction spectrum as the thickness of the resonantly absorbing waveguide array increases.The experimental measurements conducted in a waveguide array are found to be in goodagreement with the numerical results.,Optics Express,2011,17

Two-dimensional dipolar gap solitons in free space with spin-orbit coupling,Yongyao Li; Yan Liu; Zhiwei Fan; Wei Pang; Shenhe Fu; Boris A Malomed,Abstract We present gap solitons (GSs) that can be created in free nearly two-dimensional(2D) space in dipolar spinor Bose-Einstein condensates with the spin-orbit coupling (SOC);subject to tight confinement; with size a⊥; in the third direction. For quasi-2D patterns; withlateral sizes l≫ a⊥; the kinetic-energy terms in the respective spinor Gross-Pitaevskiiequations may be neglected in comparison with SOC. This gives rise to a band gap in thesystem's spectrum; in the presence of the Zeeman splitting between the spinor components.While the present system with contact interactions does not produce 2D solitons; stable gapsolitons (GSs); with vorticities 0 and 1 in the two components; are found; in quasianalyticaland numerical forms; under the action of dipole-dipole interaction (DDI).

In vitro bioaccessibility of lead in surface dust and implications for human exposure: A comparative study between industrial area and urban district,Xiangyang Bi; Zhonggen Li; Guangyi Sun; Jinling Liu; Zhixuan Han,Abstract In this study; ground surface dust samples from two contrasting areas; a former zincsmelting area in Guizhou Province and a common urban district in Wuhan city; HubeiProvince; China; were assessed for in vitro Pb bioaccessibility using a physiologically basedextraction test (PBET). Extremely elevated concentrations of Pb (220–6348 mg/kg) and othertrace metals were observed in the zinc smelting area. While moderate high metalconcentrations (79–1544 mg/kg of Pb) in the urban dusts were attributed to various urbanactivities; coal combustion and traffic emissions. Lead bioaccessibility in the stomach-phasevaried from 17.6 to 76.1% and no significant difference was found between industrial andurban dust samples. Compared with the stomach-phase; Pb bioaccessibility in the morealkaline intestinal-phase was considerably lower (1.2–21.8%). A significantly negative …,Journal of hazardous materials,2015,16
Spark plasma sintering behavior of AlON ceramics doped with different concentrations of Y2O3,Xibao Li; Junming Luo; Ya Zhou,Abstract Aluminum oxynitride (AlON) ceramics were fabricated by spark plasma sintering(SPS) from Al 2 O 3; AlN and different concentrations of Y 2 O 3. Fully dense and single-phase AlON ceramics were obtained in a sample doped with 0.6 wt% Y 2 O 3 sintered at1600° C. A proper amount of Y 2 O 3 additive can reduce sintering activation energy andenhance sintering activity due to plasma activated effects. Excess Y 2 O 3 would result in theformation of Y 3 Al 5 O 12 (YAG) as a second phase which decreased grain boundarymobility and prevented grain growth. Vickers hardness slightly increased from 15.9 to 18.1GPa; whereas fracture toughness firstly increased and then decreased with increased Y 2 O3 concentration.

Discrete solitons in self-defocusing systems with PT-symmetric defects,Zhiqiang Chen; Jiasheng Huang; Jinglei Chai; Xiangyu Zhang; Yongyao Li; Boris A Malomed,Abstract We construct families of discrete solitons (DSs) in an array of self-defocusingwaveguides with an embedded parity-time-(PT-) symmetric dimer; which is represented by apair of waveguides carrying mutually balanced gain and loss. Four types of states attachedto the embedded defect are found; namely; staggered and unstaggered bright localizedmodes and gray or antigray DSs. Their existence and stability regions expand with theincrease of the strength of the coupling between the dimer-forming sites. The existence ofthe gray and staggered bright DSs is qualitatively explained by dint of the continuum limit.

Efficient color routing with a dispersion-controlled waveguide array,Yi-Kun Liu; Si-Cong Wang; Yong-Yao Li; Li-Yan Song; Xiang-Sheng Xie; Ming-Neng Feng; Zhi-Ming Xiao; Shao-Zhi Deng; Jian-Ying Zhou; Jun-Tao Li; Kam Sing Wong; Thomas F Krauss,Abstract Splitting white light into its constituent spectral components has been of interestever since Newton first discovered the phenomenon of color separation. Many devices havesince been conceived to achieve efficient wavelength separation; yet a large number ofapplications; eg; in display technology; still use simple color absorption or rejection filtersthat absorb or reflect unwanted wavelengths; thus wasting luminous energy. Here; wedemonstrate a novel microsized device concept that enables efficient color routing. Thedevice operation is based on differential material dispersion in a waveguide array; whichcauses different wavelength signals to couple selectively into appropriate waveguides. Atheoretical power delivery of greater than 50% for a tricolor wavelength router is obtained;compared to 33% expected from geometry alone.

Structures and energies of iron promoted γ-Al2O3 surface: A computational study,Gang Feng; Chun-Fang Huo; Yong-Wang Li; Jianguo Wang; Haijun Jiao,Abstract The structure and energy of iron promoted γ-Al 2 O 3 surface have beeninvestigated in the framework of spin-polarized density functional theory using periodic slabmodel. It is found that the substitution of surface Al 3+ by Fe 3+ is thermodynamicallyaccessible; and the promoted surfaces become metallic in nature. Full substitution of Al 3+by Fe 3+ forms monolayer Fe 2 O 3 surface. H 2 O adsorption leads to reconstruction ofsurface structures. On the basis of the computed H 2 O adsorption energies; thehydroxylated Fe 2 O 3 oxide layer surface is found to be more easily dehydrated than thehydroxylated γ-Al 2 O 3 surface.,Chemical Physics Letters,2011,16

Synthesis and characterization of symmetrical benzodifuranone compounds with femtosecond time-resolved degenerate four-wave mixing technique,Zhibin Cai; Jianrong Gao; Xiaonian Li; Bin Xiang,Abstract We synthesized four symmetrical benzodifuranone compounds. Their structureswere confirmed by UV; IR; 1 H NMR and elemental analysis. The off-resonant third-ordernonlinear optical properties of the compounds were investigated via femtosecond time-resolved degenerate four-wave mixing technique with 80 fs pulse width at 800 nm. The third-order nonlinear optical susceptibilities X (3) were 2.86–3.21× 10− 13 esu. The nonlinearrefractive index n 2 were 5.26–5.91× 10− 12 esu. The second-order hyperpolarizabilities γ ofthe molecules were 2.92–3.42× 10− 31 esu. The response times were 88–91 fs.

Electrochemical impedance and cyclic voltammetry characterization of a metal hydride electrode in alkaline electrolytes,Xiaofeng Li; Huichao Dong; Aiqin Zhang; Yanwei Wei,Abstract The electrochemical characterization of a MmNi 3.55 Co 0.75 Al 0.2 Mn 0.5 metalhydride electrode in two alkaline electrolytes (NaOH or KOH) is reported. The results fromboth electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) show thatabsorption/desorption of H atoms at the metal–electrolyte interface is markedly suppressedby using a NaOH electrolyte instead of a KOH electrolyte. This results in a significantreduction of the self-decomposition rate of the negative active material and thus leads to animprovement in the self-discharge performance of nickel–metal hydride (Ni–MH) batteries.,Journal of alloys and compounds,2006,16

Study of temperature profile and specific heat capacity in temperature modulated DSC with a low sample heat diffusivity,SX Xu; Y Li; YP Feng,Abstract One important application of temperature modulated DSC (TMDSC) is themeasurement of specific heat of materials. When the sample has very good thermalconductivity as in the case of metals; the temperature gradient is not normally an importantfactor and can be ignored most of the time. However; in the case of materials with poor heattransfer properties; for example; polymers; the thermal conductivity is only in the order of1/1000 or so of that of metals. This could have a major effect on the test results. In this paper;a round analytical solution is given and a numerical model is used to analyze the effects ofthermal diffusivity on temperature distribution inside the test sample and specific heatmeasurement by TMDSC; PET sample test results are presented to demonstrate the effectsof material thermal diffusivity.,Thermochimica acta,2000,16

Howeverdisruptions damaged some of the carbon film and evaporated metal atoms. These wereredeposited on the carbon layer and became a source of impurities. Graphite limiters havebeen used since mid-1985. The metal pollution is not a problem for more than 1000discharges after one carbonization. However the low Z contamination was initially five timeslarger than earlier. Surprisingly; the oxygen concentration had considerably increased.Experiments were performed to identify the sources of C and O and to improve theconditioning methods in this “all carbon” surrounding.

The separation efficiency was found to be highly dependent on gasholdup and bubble size distribution. By changing the circulation pressure; gas flow rate;frother concentration; the effect of operation parameters on gas holdup and oil removalefficiency were attained. A mathematical modeling between the kinetic constant and the gasholdup was established for oily water separation process. The results show that higher gasholdup and smaller microbubble sizes are beneficial to improve oil removal efficiency.,International Journal of Mining Science and Technology,2013,15

Performance of Co/SiO~ 2 Catalyst for the Synthesis of Heavy Hydrocarbons in FT Reaction,Haiyan Gao; Jiangang Chen; Hongwei Xiang; Jili Yang; Yongwang Li; Yuhan Sun,A Co/SiO 2 catalyst is prepared and used in FT reaction for the synthesis of heavyhydrocarbons. The effects of various operation conditions including temperature; pressureand space velocity on its performance are investigated and a test for the catalyst stability iscarried out for 500 h. The experimental results show that the C 5+ selectivity has only a littlechange on stream; but CO conversion gradually decreases. Thus the reaction temperaturemust be raised slowly to maintain the catalyst activity. After H 2 regeneration in situ; theactivity is approximately recovered to the original level. Hydrocarbon products are mainlycomposed of alkane and the content of alkene in C 5+ hydrocarbons is about 2 25%. C 12~C 20 distillate range is superior in hydrocarbon products. The products in water phasecontain 3 56%~ 6 56% of oxygenates which are mainly lower carbon number alcohols.,Chinese Journal of Catalysis,2001,15

Methods andResults To characterize B-cell epitopes on VP1; we used the monoclonal antibody (mAb)2D10 against Escherichia coli-expressed VP1 of DHAV-1. In vitro; mAb 2D10 neutralizedDHAV-1 virus. By using an array of overlapping 12-mer peptides; we found that mAb 2D10recognized phages displaying peptides with the consensus motif LPAPTS. Sequencealignment showed that the epitope 173LPAPTS178 is highly conserved among the DHAV-1genotypes. Moreover; the six amino acid peptide LPAPTS was proven to be the minimal unitof the epitope with maximal binding activity to mAb 2D10. DHAV-1–positive duck serum …,PLoS One,2015,14
Lattice solitons with quadrupolar intersite interactions,Yongyao Li; Jingfeng Liu; Wei Pang; Boris A Malomed,Abstract We study two-dimensional (2D) solitons in the mean-field models of ultracold gaseswith long-range quadrupole-quadrupole interaction (QQI) between particles. Thecondensate is loaded into a deep optical-lattice (OL) potential; therefore the model is basedon the 2D discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation with contact on site and long-rangeintersite interactions; which represent the QQI. The quadrupoles are built as pairs of electricdipoles and antidipoles orientated perpendicular to the 2D plane to which the gas isconfined. Because the quadrupoles interact with the local gradient of the external field; theyare polarized by an inhomogeneous dc electric field that may be supplied by a taperedcapacitor. Shapes; stability; mobility; and collisions of fundamental discrete solitons arestudied by means of systematic simulations. In particular; threshold values of the norm …,Physical Review A,2013,14

Structure and stability of neutral polyoxometalate cages:(Mo 2 O 6) m (m= 1–13),Fu-Qiang Zhang; Hai-Shun Wu; Yuan-Yuan Xu; Yong-Wang Li; Haijun Jiao,Abstract The structure and stability of neutral polyoxometalate cages (Mo 2 O 6) m (m= 1–13) have been computed systematically. These neutral cages can be viewed topologicallyas polyhedra containing triangles (f 3) and squares (f 4). The relative stability of thesepolyhedra is associated with the location and separation of the f 3. The initial stable isomerswere preselected by the number of shared triangle edges (N 33); and the predicted stabilitywas validated further at the GGA-PW91/DND level of density function theory with the finequality of mesh size. For large clusters; the square neighbor signature (P 4444); which issimilar to the hexagon neighbor rule for fullerene; becomes more applicable.

Mechanistic aspects of catalyzed benzothiophene hydrodesulfurization. A density functional theory study,Xiao-Qian Yao; Yong-Wang Li; Haijun Jiao,Abstract The entire catalytic hydrodesulfurization (HDS) cycle of benzothiophene over Mo 3S 9 cluster has been investigated at the level of density functional theory. It is found that thehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis route with dihydrobenzothiophene (DHBT) asintermediate is more favored than the hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation route with styreneas intermediate. The stepwise hydrogenolysis of SB–C9 (C (aryl)–S) bond in DHBT leadingto the formation of 2-phenylethanethiol is more favored than that of SB–C2 (C (alkyl)–S)bond with 2-ethylthiophenol as intermediate. The computed activation free energy and rateconstant of benzothiophene hydrogenation to DHBT agree well with the availableexperimental data.

This system can be realized in waveguide arrays system in optics or Bose–Einstein condensate in optical lattice. Different from the symmetry breaking occurring in theground-state; antisymmetry breaking occurs in the first excited state; which containsantisymmetry. For this system; stable antisymmetric dipole soliton and anti-asymmetric arefound; the symmetry transition between them is supercritical type. It is found that; increasingthe total norm of the soliton or decreasing the coupled strength of the defect waveguide canlead to the antisymmetry breaking.

The local nonlinearity isimposed by a magnetic or optical field via the Feshbach (FB) resonance. In contrast; thenonlocal nonlinearity is created by the long-range dipole–dipole interaction among thecondensates. The orientations of the dipoles are directed by a rotatable uniform externalfield; which gives rise to a controllable nonlocal nonlinearity resulting from the angle θbetween the direction of the dipole and the elongation of the lattice.

These compute-intensive data-mining applications; where thread-level parallelism canbe effectively exploited; are the design targets of future multi-core systems. As a result; futuremulti-core systems will be required to process terabyte-level workloads. To understand thememory system performance of data-mining applications; this paper presents the use ofhardware-software co-simulation to explore the cache design space of several multi-threaded data mining applications.

Insight into the structure and intrinsic stability of the Keggin and Wells-Dawson neutral cages,Fu-Qiang Zhang; Hai-Shun Wu; Dong-Bo Cao; Xian-Ming Zhang; Yong-Wang Li; Haijun Jiao,Abstract The structure and stability of the neutral cages (M 12 O 36 and M 18 O 54; M= Moand W) of the Keggin and Wells-Dawson anions have been investigated at the level ofdensity functional theory. These neutral cages can be viewed topologically as polyhedracontaining triangles (f 3) and squares (f 4). The relative stability of these polyhedra isdetermined by the location and separation of the f 3; and the α-Keggin cage without fusedtriangles (N 33= 0) is; therefore; more stable than the β isomer with N 33= 3. This rule is alsoapplicable to the Wells-Dawson cages. The structures and stabilities of these neutral cagesmimic those of fullerenes within the framework of isolated pentagon rule.,Journal of Molecular Structure: THEOCHEM,2005,11

Influence and conditional influence-new interestingness measures in association rule mining,Guoqing Chen; De Liu; Jiexun Li,Discusses the issues of interestingness in association rule mining. First; a rule is possiblyredundant or misleading even if it possesses high degrees of confidence and support.Second; association rules do not reflect the effect of negatively influential facts. Suchproblems are related to confidence deviation. In the paper; therefore; two new measures ofinterestingness; namely influence and conditional influence; are introduced to represent theeffect of the antecedent on the consequent. Furthermore; the mining algorithms areextended accordingly such that certain redundant rules can be eliminated and negativelyinfluential rules may be discovered.,Fuzzy Systems; 2001.

Content distribution and environmental significance of nutrient salts in surface sediments in Erhai Lake [J],NB Li; Yuan Li,The high content of Total Nitrogen (TN) of Erhai Lake sediments is found at the entrancenear the Cangshan Mountain and the nearshore of east bank and the low content is the lakecenter. The research results indicate that the organic nitrogen content accounts for over 95%of the TN. The high content of Total Phosphate (TP) distributes at the center of North ErhaiLake and the Miju river Delta. The multiple regression composed of nutrient salts contentand sediments suggests that there is apparent positive correlation between TN; TON (totalorganic introgen); NH 3-N and A% while the correlation between TN and TP is small whichindicates that the environmental behaviors of Nitrogen and Phosphate are obviouslydifferent.,Yunnan Environ Sci,2001,11

Effect of MgO addition on sinterability; crystallization kinetics; and flexural strength of glass–ceramics from waste materials,Zhangyang Lu; Jinshan Lu; Xibao Li; Gangqin Shao,Abstract In this work; the effect of MgO addition on the sinterability and crystallization ofsintered glass–ceramics prepared from powder mixtures of waste glass and fly ash wasinvestigated. The bulk density of the glass–ceramics decreased with increasing the MgOcontent; reaching the maximum value at the sintering temperature of 1000° C. The amountsof the glass-ceramic crystalline phases; ie; pyroxene and forsterite; increased with the MgOcontent. Furthermore; when the MgO content increased from 5 to 25 wt%; the crystallizationmechanism changed from bulk to surface crystallization. The flexural strength wassignificantly influenced by three factors; ie; porosity; crystallinity; and crystal shapeanisotropy; and reached the maximum value of 78 MPa for a 10 wt% content of MgO.

Slow-light all-optical soliton diode based on tailored Bragg-grating structure,Hongji Li; Zhigui Deng; Jiasheng Huang; Shenhe Fu; Yongyao Li,All-optical soliton diode (AOSD) is proposed based on a sandwich nonlinear Bragg-gratingstructure: a linearly chirped Bragg-grating linked to a uniform Bragg-grating and again to achirped Bragg-grating. The nonreciprocity is achieved by introducing two spatiallyasymmetric chirped Bragg-gratings with optical nonlinearity. High transmission ratio up to150 is obtained when launching a picosecond Gaussian pulse into the setting. We find thatsuch pulses in a form of solitons propagate at a rather small velocity (< 0.03 c) when pulsewavelength is selected in the vicinity of photonic bandgap.,Optics letters,2015,10

Response analysis of buried pipelines crossing fault due to overlying soil rupture,Lei Zhao; Chengchen Cui; Xiaojun Li,Abstract A 3-D soil-pipe nonlinear finite element model with contact element is suggestedand the influences of the rupture mode; thickness and rigidity of overlying soil on theresponse of buried pipeline are analyzed. The numerical results show that the soil rupturemode determines the location of the large deformation or failure of the pipeline; and theplastic deformation of the pipeline occurs at the zone where the plastic deformation orrupture of the overlying soil appears. When the fault dip angle on bedrock is near 90°; twoplastic deformation sections of the pipeline appear with the development of overlying soilrupture. And the thicker the overlying soil is; the longer the plastic deformation length of thepipeline is and the less its strain is. The plastic deformation length of the pipeline decreaseswhile its maximum strain increases with the rigidity of overlying soil increasing.,Earthquake Science,2010,10
Characterization of kiwifruit xyloglucan,Xingjun Li; Naoki Sakurai; Donald J Nevins,Abstract Structural characteristics of xyloglucan are constant in the pericarp cell walls ofkiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) throughout fruit enlargement and maturation. Most of thexyloglucan (XG) persists in the cell walls of ripe kiwifruit. XG from the pericarp tissues of 36-hethylene-treated kiwifruit was extracted as hemicellulose II (HC-II) with 4.28 M KOHcontaining 0.02% NaBH 4; and purified using iodine precipitation and subsequent anion-exchange chromatography. This purifying protocol increased XG purity from 50 mol% in HC-II fraction to 62 mol% in the purified XG powder. The molar ratio of glucose: xylose:galactose: fucose in the purified XG was 10: 6.9: 2.1: 0.3.

On the Fetet1-terminated surface at 1/5 monolayer (ML); the molecular adsorption mode with ahydrogen bond and the heterolytically dissociative mode show the highest stability; whereasthe hydronium-ion-like structure OH 3+-OH becomes possible at 2/5 ML; followed by thehydrogen-bonded water aggregate. These results agree well with the availableexperimental observations. For Fe oct2-terminated surface; the molecular water prefers toadsorb on the surface Fe oct2 atom at 1/6 ML; whereas other adsorption modes becomepossible and may coexist at 1/3 ML.

All-optical diode realized by one-dimensional waveguide array,Zhenjing Peng; Hongji Li; Zhiwei Fan; Xiangyu Zhang; Yongyao Li,We demonstrate an optical diode by building a domain wall with one-dimensionalwaveguide array. The domain wall can be described by dividing the one-dimensionalwaveguide array into two equal parts; which have different refractive index; so that thewaveguide array exists local potential. A Gaussian beam is kicked moving toward thedomain wall and interacts with it. Transmission and reflection during the interaction betweenthe Gaussian beam and the domain wall are found by changing related parameters. Thedetailed behavior of the Gaussian beam dynamics is analyzed numerically. Transmission ofthe Gaussian beam in one direction is much bigger than the opposite under certaincircumstances and optical nonreciprocity is found in such a model; high transmission ratio ofsuch model up to 300 is obtained. Thus the system can serve as an optical diode.,Journal of Nonlinear Optical Physics & Materials,2015,9

Ferroelectric and nonlinear optical properties of the LiNbO3-type ZnGeO3 from first-principles study,J Zhang; B Xu; Z Qin; XF Li; KL Yao,Abstract Electronic structure; spontaneous polarization; piezoelectric; and nonlinear opticalproperties of the LiNbO 3 (LN)-type ZnGeO 3 have been investigated based on the densityfunctional theory. The electronic structure reveals that the LN and corundum-type ZnGeO 3are both direct-band-gap semiconductors. The results reveal that the LN-type ZnGeO 3 isferroelectric with a large spontaneous polarization of 63.59 μC/cm 2. Although the LN-typeZnGeO 3 and LiNbO 3 belong to the same point group 3m; their piezoelectric and nonlinearoptical susceptibilities show the different tensor forms. According to the predictive results; thelarge piezoelectric constants and NLO susceptibilities reveal that the LN-type ZnGenO 3would be a candidate for a high-performance lead-free piezoelectric and nonlinear opticalcrystal; which will avoid the environmental toxicity problem of the lead-based materials.,Journal of Alloys and Compounds,2012,9

An improvement on redox reversibility of cobalt oxyhydroxide in nickel hydroxide electrodes,Xiaofeng Li; Huichao Dong; Hualin Zhang,Abstract In this paper; two kinds of cobalt oxyhydroxide conductive networks wereintroduced into nickel hydroxide electrodes by different methods—electrochemically-oxidized (EO) or chemically oxidized (CO) CoOOH on the surface of nickel hydroxideparticles. The redox behaviors of them were studied by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. It shows that because CoOOH (CO) has better redoxreversibility than CoOOH (EO); the structure of the former can be kept when nickel hydroxideelectrodes are subjected to a negative potential. Thus; 98.5% capacity retention isdemonstrated on nickel/metal-hydride (Ni–MH) batteries with CoOOH (CO) after beingimposed over-discharge state storage; on the contrary; only 81.4% capacity retention isfound on the batteries with CoOOH (EO).,Materials Chemistry and Physics,2008,9

Most CBVIR systems are basedon low-level feature extractions guided by the MPEG-7 standard for high-level semanticconcept indexing. It is well known that CBVIR is a very compute-intensive task; and the low-level visual feature extractions are the most timeconsuming components in CBVIR.Nowadays; with the multi-core processor becoming mainstream; CBVIR can be acceleratedby fully utilizing the computing power of available multi-core processors. In this paper; weoptimize and parallelize a set of typical visual feature extraction applications in CBVIR.

This nitride is a well-known kind of high-hardness material; and it is found to be highly incompressible. Thestructure is stable with no phase transitions observed in this pressure range. The zero-pressure bulk modulus and its pressure derivative at ambient pressure are B 0= 360±3 GPa;B 0'= 4; and in room conditions; the a and c parameters are 3.054 Å; 4.996 Å; respectively.The bulk modulus of Ta 2 N is greater than those of TaC; ε-TaN; Cr 2 N and MoN. Thedifferences in bulk moduli might be due to the differences in structure and the cohesiveenergy among these phases.,Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter,2007,9
Slow positron beam study of nitrogen implanted CZ-Si subjected to rapid thermal processing,XP Hao; RS Yu; BY Wang; HL Chen; DN Wang; CX Ma; L Wei,Abstract In this experiment; nitrogen ions were implanted into CZ-silicon wafer at 100 keV atroom temperature with the fluence of 5× 10 15 N 2+/cm 2; followed by rapid thermalprocessing (RTP) at different temperatures. The single detector Doppler broadening andcoincidence Doppler broadening measurements on slow positron beam were carried out tocharacterize the defects in the as-implanted silicon and RTP-treated samples. It is found thatboth nitrogen-vacancy complexes (N-Vsi) and oxygen-vacancy complexes (O-Vsi) producedby nitrogen implantation diffuse back to the sample surface upon annealing. But the N-Vsiand the O-Vsi complete with each other and give a summed effect on positron annihilationcharacteristics. It is shown that the N-Vsi win out the O-Vsi in as-implanted sample and byRTP at 650° C; 750° C; which make the S-parameter increase; O-Vsi plays a dominant …,Applied surface science,2007,9

Energy decomposition analysisreveals that the enhanced stabilities of γ; δ; and ε isomers originate the favorablearrangements of their Mo12O12S12 (OH) 12 shell; in which the edge-sharing [MoV2 (μ-S)2O2] fragment plays a fundamental role in stabilizing the overall structure. Both frontierorbital analysis and Mayer indexes exhibit that a Mo− Mo single bond is formed inside the[MoV2 (μ-S) 2O2] fragment; which leads to the localization of the two reduced electrons.

Effect of solvent type on the degradation of 4-MET,Kou Fujita; Rui LI; Jun LI; Takuji IKEMI; Norihiro NISHIYAMA,The degradation mechanism of 4-MET was strongly dependent on the type of solvent used.When an alcohol-based solution was used for 4-MET; the esterification of 1-or 2-carboxylicacid in 4-MET occurred. However; when an acetone solvent was used for 4-MET; theesterification reaction did not occur. Increases in the aging period of 4-MET solvatedsolutions resulted in the hydrolysis of the benzoyl ester portion in 4-MET. The 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate; produced as a subproduct; also became hydrolyzed. In addition; methacrylicacid; non-esterified and esterified trimellitic acid; as well as ethylene glycol were producedas subproducts. In particular; the production of trimellitic acid and ethylene glycol affectedthe bonding efficacy and durability of the resin to the tooth created by self-etching primers orone-step bonding agents that contained the altered 4-MET.,Dental materials journal,2007,9

Fractal analysis of crack paths in Al2O3-TiC-4% Co composites,LI Jing; Yan-Sheng Yin; Ying-Cai Liu,Abstract Al 2 O 3-TiC-4% Co (volume fraction) composites (ATC) with high toughness(7.8±0.8 MPa· m½) and strength (782±60 MPa) were fabricated. In comparison with Al 2 O 3-TiC composites (AT); the fracture toughness was significantly unproved by 60%. The crackpaths; generated by Vickers indentation on the polished surfaces of both composites; wereanalyzed from a fractal point of view to distinguish the possible toughening mechanismsinvolved. Quantitative evaluation of indentation cracks indicates that the crack deflectionplays a more effective role. Cracks of the ATC composites show higher deflection anglesand more deflections along the path. ATC composites present higher fractal dimension (D=1.07) than AT composites (D= 1.02); which is directly related to the higher fracturetoughness. A significant relationship between crack path and toughness is evident: the …,Transactions of Nonferrous Metals Society of China,2006,9
Switching End-on into Side-on C⋮ N Coordination: A Computational Approach,Chun-Fang Huo; Tao Zeng; Yong-Wang Li; Matthias Beller; Haijun Jiao,The stability of the end-on and side-on complexes of acetonitrile with HCo (L) 3 [L= CO;PH3; PPh3; PMe3; 1; 2-bis (dimethyl) phosphinoethane (dmpe); N-heterocyclic carbene(NHC)] has been computed at the B3LYP density functional level of theory. It is found thatthe most common end-on coordination mode of nitriles to transition metals can be changedinto the side-on coordination via reasonable ligand tailoring. The dmpe-and NHC-modifiedcatalyst; HCo (dmpe)(NHC); prefers the side-on complex over the end-on complex ofacetonitrile by 1.1 kcal/mol in free energy.

Catalyzed chemoselective acrolein hydrogenation. Density functional studies,Chun-Fang Huo; Yong-Wang Li; Matthias Beller; Haijun Jiao,The catalytic chemoselective hydrogenation of CO and CC bonds of acrolein by HCo (CO) 3has been investigated at the B3LYP density functional level of theory. For the COhydrogenation to allyl alcohol; it is found that the reaction path with the allyloxy intermediateis more favored than the alternative path with the hydroxyallyl intermediate both kineticallyand thermodynamically. For the CC hydrogenation to propanal; the reaction path of thehydride transfer to Cβ is more favored than to Cα by the lower barrier of the Co− H insertionand the overall lower free energy barriers. The larger stability of the π complex HCo (CO) 3(η2-H2C CHCHO) determines the CC chemoselectivity. Thus; propanal is the expectedprincipal product; while the formation of allyl alcohol is almost suppressed; in line with theexperimental finding.,Organometallics,2004,9

Two-dimensional solitons and quantum droplets supported by competing self-and cross-interactions in spin-orbit-coupled condensates,Yongyao Li; Zhihuan Luo; Yan Liu; Zhaopin Chen; Chunqing Huang; Shenhe Fu; Haishu Tan; Boris A Malomed,Abstract We study two-dimensional (2D) matter-wave solitons in spinor Bose–Einsteincondensates under the action of the spin–orbit coupling and opposite signs of the self-andcross-interactions. Stable 2D two-component solitons of the mixed-mode type are found ifthe cross-interaction between the components is attractive; while the self-interaction isrepulsive in each component. Stable solitons of the semi-vortex type are formed in theopposite case; under the action of competing self-attraction and cross-repulsion. Thesolitons exist with the total norm taking values below a collapse threshold. Further; in thecase of the repulsive self-interaction and inter-component attraction; stable 2D self-trappedmodes; which may be considered as quantum droplets (QDs); are created if the beyond-mean-field Lee–Huang–Yang terms are added to the self-repulsion in the underlying …,New Journal of Physics,2017,8

Effect of hydrofluoric acid etching of glass on the performance of organic–inorganic glass laminates,Xibao Li; Jinshan Lu; Zhijun Feng,Abstract Organic–inorganic glass laminates with polyurethane (PU) as an adhesiveinterlayer were prepared by a warm-pressing method. The hydrofluoric acid etching of glasssurface was performed to investigate its effect on the mechanical behavior of glasslaminates. Results show that the acidic etching treatment of glass seldom influences thetransparency and haze of glass laminates when the etching time is below 30 min. Thebonding strength and fracture stress of glass laminates firstly increase and then decreasewith increasing etching time. This could be attributed to the formation of three-dimensionalinterface of glass laminates. The unique interface structure not only increases the contactarea between glass and PU layer; leading to the improvement of interface bonding; but alsomodifies the stress distribution at the interfaces; which is favorable to prevent the crack …,Composites Part B: Engineering,2013,8
Large duplication in MTM1 associated with myotubular myopathy,K Amburgey; MW Lawlor; D Del Gaudio; YW Cheng; C Fitzpatrick; A Minor; X Li; D Aughton; S Das; AH Beggs; JJ Dowling,Abstract Myotubular myopathy is a subtype of centronuclear myopathy with X-linkedinheritance and distinctive clinical and pathologic features. Most boys with myotubularmyopathy have MTM1 mutations. In remaining individuals; it is not clear if disease is due toan undetected alteration in MTM1 or mutation of another gene. We describe a boy withmyotubular myopathy but without mutation in MTM1 by conventional sequencing. Array-CGH analysis of MTM1 uncovered a large MTM1 duplication. This finding suggests that atleast some unresolved cases of myotubular myopathy are due to duplications in MTM1; andthat array-CGH should be considered when MTM1 sequencing is unrevealing.,Neuromuscular Disorders,2013,8
Analytical solutions of spherical cavity expansion near a slope due to pile installation,Jingpei Li; Yaguo Zhang; Haibing Chen; Fayun Liang,Based on the hypothesis that the penetration of a single pile can be simulated by a series ofspherical cavity expansions; this paper presents an analytical solution of cavity expansionnear the sloping ground. Compared with the cavity expansion in the half-space; the slopingfree boundary has been taken into account as well as the horizontal free boundary. Thesloping and horizontal free surfaces are considered by the introduction of a virtual imagetechnique; the harmonic function; and the Boussinesq solution. The results show that thesloping free boundary and the variation of the inclination angle have pronounced influenceson the distribution of the stress and displacement induced by the spherical cavity expansion.The present solution provides a simplified and realistic theoretical method to predict the soilbehaviors around the spherical cavity near the sloping ground.

On the α/β-[AlW12O40] 5− stability: Revisited,Fu-Qiang Zhang; Hai-Shun Wu; Xiao-Fang Qin; Yong-Wang Li; Haijun Jiao,Abstract The structure and stability of the α/β-[AlW 12 O 40] 5− anions have beeninvestigated with seven density functional based methods. It has been found that the relativestability of these anions are sensitive to the density functionals; and the α isomer is morestable than the β one in both gas phase and simulated aqueous medium. This conclusionhas also been supported by further calculations on the relative stability of the highly chargedα/β-[XW 12 O 40] y−(X= Fe (III); Co (III); Zn (II)) anions.

Influence of post-implantation annealing on the oxidation behavior of Nb implanted γ-TiAl based alloy,XY Li; TH Zhang; BK Ma; YG Zhang; CQ Chen,Abstract The influence of post-implantation annealing on the isothermal oxidation behaviorof Nb implanted (3× 10 17 ions/cm 2) Ti–48 at.% Al was investigated. The kinetics ofisothermal oxidation at 900° C for 100 h in air revealed that appropriate post-implantationannealing (800° C/5 h) could remarkably further improve the oxidation resistance of the as-implanted alloy; possible mechanisms were discussed considering the results of elementdistribution; oxidation product and its surface morphology examined by Auger electronspectra (AES); X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). It indicatedthat both the eliminating of the lattice damage induced by ion implantation and elementredistribution in the implanted region caused by post-implantation annealing might beresponsible for the further decrease of the oxidation rate.,Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms,2000,8

Dipolar matter-wave solitons in two-dimensional anisotropic discrete lattices,Huaiyu Chen; Yan Liu; Qiang Zhang; Yuhan Shi; Wei Pang; Yongyao Li,Abstract We numerically demonstrate two-dimensional (2D) matter-wave solitons in the disk-shaped dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) trapped in strongly anisotropic opticallattices (OLs) in a disk's plane. The considered OLs are square lattices which can be formedby interfering two pairs of plane waves with different intensities. The hopping rates of thecondensates between two adjacent lattices in the orthogonal directions are different; whichgives rise to a linearly anisotropic system. We find that when the polarized orientation of thedipoles is parallel to disk's plane with the same direction; the combined effects of the linearlyanisotropy and the nonlocal nonlinear anisotropy strongly influence the formations; as wellas the dynamics of the lattice solitons. Particularly; the isotropy-pattern solitons (IPSs) arefound when these combined effects reach a balance. Motion; collision; and rotation of the …,Physical Review A,2016,7
Hypoxia increases IGFBP-1 phosphorylation mediated by mTOR inhibition,Ian Damerill; Kyle K Biggar; Majida Abu Shehab; Shawn Shun-Cheng Li; Thomas Jansson; Madhulika B Gupta,Abstract In fetal growth restriction (FGR); fetal growth is limited by reduced nutrient andoxygen supply. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is a key regulator of fetal growth and IGFbinding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) is the principal regulator of fetal IGF-I bioavailability.Phosphorylation enhances IGFBP-1's affinity for IGF-I. Hypoxia induces IGFBP-1hyperphosphorylation; markedly decreasing IGF-I bioavailability. We recently reported thatfetal liver IGFBP-1 hyperphosphorylation is associated with inhibition of the mechanistictarget of rapamycin (mTOR) in a nonhuman primate model of FGR. Here; we test thehypothesis that IGFBP-1 hyperphosphorylation in response to hypoxia is mediated by mTORinhibition. We inhibited mTOR either by rapamycin or small interfering RNA (siRNA)targeting raptor (mTOR complex [mTORC] 1) and/or rictor (mTORC2) in HepG2 cells …,Molecular Endocrinology,2016,7
Characterization of monoclonal antibodies against duck hepatitis type 1 virus VP1 protein,Tingting Zhang; Xiaojun Li; Xiaoying Wu; Wulin Shaozhou; Xiaofei Bai; Siguo Liu; Ming Liu; Yun Zhang,Abstract The VP1 protein of duck hepatitis type 1 virus (DHV-1); one of the major structuralproteins; is able to induce neutralizing antibody in ducks; but a monoclonal antibody (mAb)against VP1 protein has never been characterized. Four hybridoma cell lines secreting antiDHV-1A VP1 mAbs were prepared and designated 2D9; 2D10; 5F7; and 3E8.Immunoglobulin subclass tests differentiated them as IgG1 (2D9 and 2D10) and IgG2b (5F7and 3E8). Dot blot and western blotting assays showed that mAbs reacted with His-VP1protein in a conformation-independent manner. Competitive binding assays indicated thatmAbs delineated three epitopes; namely A; B and C; of VP1. Immunofluorescence assaysindicated that mAbs could specifically bind to duck embryo fibroblast (DEF) cells infectedwith DHV-1A. mAbs 2D9; 2D10; and 5F7 had universal reactivity to heterologous DHV …,Journal of virological methods,2014,7
TED; an autonomous and rare maize transposon of the Mutator superfamily with a high gametophytic excision frequency,Yubin Li; Linda Harris; Hugo K Dooner,Mutator (Mu) elements; one of the most diverse superfamilies of DNA transposons; are foundin all eukaryotic kingdoms; but are particularly numerous in plants. Most of the presentknowledge on the transposition behavior of this superfamily comes from studies of the maize(Zea mays) Mu elements; whose transposition is mediated by the autonomous Mutator-DonRobertson (MuDR) element. Here; we describe the maize element TED (for TransposonEllen Dempsey); an autonomous cousin that differs significantly from MuDR. Elementexcision and reinsertion appear to require both proteins encoded by MuDR; but only thesingle protein encoded by TED. Germinal excisions; rare with MuDR; are common with TED;but arise in one of the mitotic divisions of the gametophyte; rather than at meiosis. Instead;transposition-deficient elements arise at meiosis; suggesting that the double-strand …,The Plant Cell,2013,7
Wheat 14-3-3 protein conferring growth retardation in Arabidopsis,LI Jing; Su-sheng SONG; Yu-sheng ZHAO; Wei-wei GUO; Guang-hui GUO; Hui-ru PENG; Zhong-fu NI; Qi-xin SUN; Ying-yin YAO,Abstract 14-3-3 proteins belong to a family of phosphoserine/threonine-binding modulesand participate in a wide array of signal transduction and regulatory events. Our previousstudy demonstrated that Ta14-3-3 was significantly down-regulated in leaf and root tissuesof hybrid wheat at the tillering stage. In this paper; three homoeologous Ta14-3-3 geneswere cloned from common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.; 2n= 6x= 42; AABBDD) and mappedon chromosomes 2A; 2B; and 2D; respectively. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants ectopicallyoverexpressing Ta14-3-3 displayed shorter primary roots; delayed flowering and retardedgrowth rates; indicating that Ta14-3-3 acted as a growth inhibitor in Arabidopsis. In wheat;Ta14-3-3 was down-regulated in roots and leaves of hybrids as compared to their parentallines. We proposed that Ta14-3-3 proteins might regulate growth vigor in hybrid wheat.,Journal of Integrative Agriculture,2013,7
Critical behavior of Anderson localization under saturable self-defocusing nonlinearity,Yongyao Li; Jianxiong Wu; Jingfeng Liu; Yan Liu,We theoretically investigate the optical Anderson localization in the disorderedphotorefractive lattices under different strength of saturable self-defocusing nonlinearity.

The effect of pressure on equilibrium conversion and selectivity of ethylene glycolmonopropionate (monoester) and ethylene glycol dipropinonate (diester) was studiedsystematically. It was shown that the equilibrium conversion and selectivity was nearlyindependent of pressure as pressure was lower than 9 MPa. At higher pressure; however;the yield and selectivity of the diester increased considerably; while those of the monoesterdecreased with increasing pressure. The main reason was that reactants and productsdistributed between the vapor phase and liquid phase at higher pressures. The solventpower of CO2 for the diester is stronger than that for the monoester. More diester moleculesin the liquid phase were extracted into the vapor at higher pressures; which shifted …,The Journal of Physical Chemistry B,2007,7

NO Adsorption on MoS x Clusters: A Density Functional Theory Study,Xiao-Dong Wen; Yong-Wang Li; Jianguo Wang; Haijun Jiao,The density functional theory (DFT) method has been used to investigate NO probemolecule adsorption on the stoichiometric (Mo16S32) and nonstoichiometric (Mo16S34 andMo16S29) clusters. The calculated adsorption energies indicate that the stoichiometriccluster has stronger NO affinity than the nonstoichiometric surfaces. It is also found thatmononitrosyl adsorption is favored at low NO coverage; while dinitrosyl (germinal) and (NO)2 dimer adsorption at high NO coverage are possible. Strong repulsive interaction has beenfound for the adsorbed dinitrosyl and (NO) 2 dimer species. In addition; the computed NOstretching frequencies for the mononitrosyl and dinitrosyl species agree well with theexperimental data; while those of the dimer species are much lower than the suggestedexperimental data.,The Journal of Physical Chemistry B,2006,7

Symmetry breaking of discrete solitons in two-component waveguide arrays with long-range linearly coupled effect,Zhijie Mai; Wei Pang; Jianxiong Wu; Yongyao Li,In this work; we study the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of discrete solitons in two-component waveguide arrays with long-range linearly coupled effect. Stable symmetry andasymmetry two-component discrete solitons are found in the system. The symmetrytransition between them are studied. We find that; increasing the strength of the linear long-range coupling; the process of the symmetry breaking from the symmetric soliton to theasymmetric soliton will switch from supercritical to subcritical type. The specific switch pointis identified by numerical simulations. Compared to the case with nonlinear long-rangecouplings; the SSB with linear long-range coupling is opposite in behavior.

Fast facial landmark detection using cascade classifiers and a simple 3D model,Ang Liu; Yangzhou Du; Tao Wang; Jianguo Li; Eric Q Li; Yimin Zhang; Yong Zhao,Facial landmark detection is an essential module in many face related applications and itoften appears as the most time consuming part in face processing pipeline. This paperproposes a fast and effective method for facial landmark detection using Haar cascadeclassifiers and a simple 3D head model; which not only detects the position of landmarkpoints but also gives an estimation of head pose such as yaw and pitch angles. To reducethe amount of computation; only 7 landmark points are detected (4 eye corners; 2 mouthcorners; 1 nose tip) that generally meets the requirement of face alignment and facerecognition. Experiment on multiple datasets shows our algorithm can provide sufficientaccuracy of facial landmark localization while being able to run in super real-time at IntelAtom 1.3 GHz embedded processors.,Image Processing (ICIP); 2011 18th IEEE International Conference on,2011,6

The endogenous hormone concentrations (indoleaceticacid (IAA); abscisic acid (ABA); gibberellins 3 (GA3); and zeatin (ZT)) of the initial explantsand calluses were determined by means of high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).The endogenous IAA and IAA/ZT ratio were higher in the explants that were more effective toinduce callus; and ABA was negative to callus formation. When analyzing the endogenoushormone concentrations in the various callus types generated in anthers and stems; it wasfound that a higher concentrations of ZT was present in the stem calluses that had formedbuds; while higher IAA/ZT and GA3/ZT ratios were present in the calluses having no budformation capacity; originated from anthers and stems.,Interciencia,2010,6
Dehydration of goethite to hematite from molecular dynamics simulation,Wen-Juan Zhang; Chun-Fang Huo; Gang Feng; Yong-Wang Li; Jianguo Wang; Haijun Jiao,Abstract In Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS); the prepared catalyst hematite (α-Fe 2 O 3)originates from goethite (α-FeOOH) dehydration in calcinations process. The structure of α-FeOOH and its topotactic transformation into α-Fe 2 O 3 under 300–900 K have beenmodeled within the framework of density functional theory. Molecular dynamics simulationsshow that the transformation begins preferentially on the surface and the dehydration isassociated with the formation of voids. The loss of H 2 O in α-FeOOH does not modify themorphology extremely with respect to that of the original α-FeOOH. The transformationprocess involves hydrogen migration with the formation of adsorbed water; followed bydesorption of the water molecule. The calculated barriers for hydrogen migration (118kJ/mol) and water desorption (82 kJ/mol) suggest a direct reaction path without the …,Journal of Molecular Structure: THEOCHEM,2010,6

Young's modulus size effect of SCS nanobeam by tensile testing in electron microscopy,QH Jin; T Li; YL Wang; XX Li; H Yang; FF Xu,In-situ tensile testing in EM (electron microscopy) is a useful tool for studying mechanicalproperties of nano-structures because it can provide quantitative information on sampledeformation at atomic scale. In this work; MEMS tensile-testing chips with differently thick≪110≫-oriented SCS nanobeams were designed; fabricated and utilized in SEM and/or TEMto manipulate SCS nanobeam and measure its strain and stress in nano scale. We obtainedYoung's modulus of SCS nanobeams with thicknesses from 30nm to 100nm; and found thatE decreased monotonously with the beams decreasing thickness. A simple modal wasconstructed to qualitatively illustrate this size dependence by taking surface effect intoaccount and it shows that surface layers have different effects on E in tensile testing from thatin resonant testing.,Sensors; 2009 IEEE,2009,6

A Linguistic Lattice-Valued Approach for Fuzzy Multi-Objective Decision Making.,Xiaobing Li; Da Ruan; Jun Liu; Yang Xu,Abstract Most of the present methods for multi-objective decision making can only deal withlinearly ordered preference information. In this paper; we focus on investigating methods formulti-objective decision making when the preference information set includes incomparablenatural language terms. A logical algebraic structure of lattice implication algebra is thenapplied to represent both comparable and incomparable information simultaneously.

And we extend the model to dealwith the multi-objective decision making when the preference information set is ageneralized linguistic-valued lattice. In these cases; decision makers can supply latticeinformation on their preference and weights of the individual objectives.[ABSTRACT …,Journal of Multiple-Valued Logic & Soft Computing,2008,6
Reasoning rules of linguistic truth values lattice-valued first order logic with generalized quantifiers based on L-LIA,Jiajun Lai; Yang Xu; XIAODONG PAN; ZHIYAN CHANG; KAIJUN XU; XIAOBING LI,Abstract This paper focuses on investigating the inference rules with generalized quantifiersin a lattice-valued first-order logic system ℓF (X) with truth-values in a linguistic truth-valuedlattice implication algebra (L-LIA). Since the qualifier constraint may become more importantwhen considering the semantic of natural language; so in using multi-valued logic as a toolto model approximate reasoning; how to control the truth-value transfer during the inferenceprocess for some rule with qualifiers is very important; which is not the case in classical logicin which the logic deduction system is symbolic reasoning with strict syntactical proof; thesemantics are too simple to be considered. This work put more effort on semanticinterpretation and truth-valued transfer; especially present and investigate some reasoningrules with generalized quantifiers (rather than universal quantifiers and existential …,*,2008,6
Video summarization by redundancy removing and content ranking,Tao Wang; Yue Gao; Patricia P Wang; Eric Li; Wei Hu; Yimin Zhang; Junhai Yong,Abstract In order to help the user to grasp the long video content quickly; this paperproposes a novel video summarization approach based on redundancy removal andcontent ranking. By video parsing and cast indexing; the approach first constructs a storyboard to let user know about the main scenes and the main actors in the video. Then itgenerates a" story-constraint summary" by key frame clustering and repetitive segmentdetection. To shorten the video summary length to a target length; our approach constructsa" time-constraint summary" by important factor based content ranking.

Parallelization and performance characterization of protein 3D structure prediction of Rosetta,Wenlong Li; Tao Wang; Eric Li; David Baker; Li Jin; Steven Ge; Yurong Chen; Yimin Zhang,The prediction of protein 3D structure has become a hot research area in the post-genomeera; through which people can understand a protein's function in health and disease;explore ways to control its actions and assist drug design. Many protein structure predictionapproaches have been proposed in past decades. Among them; Rosetta is one of the bestsystems. However; the huge time complexity of Rosetta; eg a few days to predict a protein;limits its wide use in practice. To accelerate the prediction of protein 3D structure in Rosetta;this paper presents three different approaches; ie; non-interactive; periodic interactive andasynchronous dynamic interactive scheme; to parallelize Rosetta. The asynchronousinteractive scheme; with the adaptation of dynamic solution interaction; outperforms theother two; delivering much faster convergence speed and better solution quality.

Membrane lipid peroxidation and protective enzymes activity induced in rice leaves by GP66 elicitor from Magnaporthe grisea,YF Li; ZZ Wang,Activation of membrane lipid peroxidation and defense enzymes was investigated on bothincompatible and compatible rice leaves treated with M. grisea-derived elicitor GP66.Compared with the compatible rice; the GP66 treatment caused rapid and remarkable O-2·generation and an increasing of lipoxygenase (LOX) activity in incompatible rice leaves.These changes further led to lipid peroxidation; concomitant with an increasing of therelative conductance rate and an accumulation of the maloondiadehyde (MDA). Peroxidase(POD) was also stimulated in the early stage of the incompatible reaction. By contrast;treatment of GP66 caused a decline of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and catalase(CAT) activity in both compatible and incompatible rice cultivars. The results suggest thatlipid peroxidation in rice leaves induced by GP66 elicitor may play an important role in the …,Acta Phytopathologica Sinica,2005,6

Adaptive Zero-Block Detection Algorithm with Multi-Resolution,Qiang LI; Hui-juan CUI; Kun TANG; Wen DU,In the current applications such as video conferencing; the video codec speed is the keyfactor to maintain the real-time performance in the whole system. In order to minimize thecomputations and improve the performance of video coding; an adaptive zero blockdetection algorithm combined with multi-resolution motion estimation is proposed in thispaper. The multi-resolution technique uses down-sampling method on the whole image;which can dramatically reduce the computations in searching for the best candidate blockduring the motion search period. At the same time; adaptive zero block detection criteria canmake the motion search procedure even faster and improve the coding efficiency withoutany influence on the image quality. Furthermore; the run-time of DCT (discrete cosinetransform) and quantization has been significantly reduced afterwards. Simulation results …,Journal of Software,2002,6

Anisotropic semivortices in dipolar spinor condensates controlled by Zeeman splitting,Bingjin Liao; Shoubo Li; Chunqing Huang; Zhihuan Luo; Wei Pang; Haishu Tan; Boris A Malomed; Yongyao Li,Abstract Spatially anisotropic solitary vortices; ie; bright anisotropic vortex solitons (AVSs);supported by anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions; were recently predicted in spin-orbit-coupled binary Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs); in the form of two-dimensionalsemivortices (complexes built of zero-vorticity and vortical components). We demonstratethat the shape of the AVSs—horizontal or vertical; with respect to the in-plane polarization ofthe atomic dipole moments in the underlying BEC—may be effectively controlled by thestrength Ω of the Zeeman splitting (ZS). A transition from the horizontal to vertical shape withthe increase of Ω is found numerically and explained analytically. At the transition point; theAVS assumes the shape of an elliptical ring. The mobility of horizontal AVSs is studied; too;with the conclusion that; with the increase of Ω; their negative effective mass changes the …,Physical Review A,2017,5
Long-range transverse Ising model built with dipolar condensates in two-well arrays,Yongyao Li; Wei Pang; Jun Xu; Chaohong Lee; Boris A Malomed; Luis Santos,Abstract Dipolar Bose–Einstein condensates in an array of double-well potentials realize aneffective transverse Ising model with peculiar inter-layer interactions; that may result underproper conditions in an anomalous first-order ferromagnetic–antiferromagnetic phasetransition; and non-trivial phases due to frustration. The considered setup allows as well forthe study of Kibble–Zurek defect formation; whose kink statistics follows that expected fromthe universality class of the mean-field one-dimensional transverse Ising model.Furthermore; random occupation of each layer of the stack leads to random effective Isinginteractions and local transverse fields; that may lead to the Anderson-like localization ofimbalance perturbations.,New Journal of Physics,2017,5

By tuning the coupling parameter and total opticalpower; four types of mode have been found. Double symmetry breaking; which is acombination of the symmetry breaking of the waveform and the optical power distribution;occurs under specific conditions. The numerical simulations show that there are someoverlaps among the different stable modes; which have confirmed the coexistence of themodes. It is found that the region where the four stable modes coexist shifts with the variationin the rotating speed; and the corresponding parameters; the coupling parameter and totalpower; decrease sharply with the increase in the rotating speed.,Journal of the Physical Society of Japan,2013,4

Responses of Buried Pipeline Crossing Fault Due to the Overlaying Soil Rupture [J],Lei ZHAO; Xiaojun LI; Jisheng ZHAO; Xiaobo PENG; Chengchen CUI,The influences of the rupture mode; the overlaying soil thickness and stiffness to the buriedpipeline is analyzed by a 3D soil-and-pipe nonlinear ANSYS finite element model. Thenumerical results show the soil rupture mode determines the locations of the pipeline largedeformation or failure; and the pipeline plastic deformation occurs at the zone where theplastic deformation or rupture of the overlaying soil occurs. When the fault dislocation angleis near 90; two plastically deforming pipeline sections appear with the overlying soil ruptureextending. And the thicker the overlaying soil is; the longer the plastically deforming lengthof the buried pipeline is and the less its strain is. The plastically deforming pipeline length inthe stiff soil got short; while its maximum strain increased.,Journal of Basic Science and Engineering,2009,4

Improvement to ill-conditioned two-dimensional vehicle collision models,Jian ZHANG; LI Jiang; NI Xingda,Matrix perturbation theory was applied to analyzing the ill-conditioned two-dimensionalvehicle collision model. The analysis shows that the ill-condition is caused by the linearcorrelation between some equations in the model. The linear correlation was solved by amathematical transform to get new equations free of ill-condition; and reconstructed modelscomposed of the new equations were obtained. The reconstructed models and the originalone formed a new model. The calculated result of a real collision case shows that the newmodel reduces the relative error from 71.91% to 16.4% compared with that by the originalmodel when the mass ratio of the two vehicles involved falls into a specific range and thereis 5% error in the measured coordinates of the colliding point on the two vehicles.,Journal of Southwest Jiaotong University,2007,4

Mechanisms of Enhanced Nuclear Translocation of the Transcription Factors c‐Rel and NF‐kB by CD28 Costimulation in Human T Lymphocytes,JENN‐HAUNG LAI; Györgyi Horvath; Yongqin Li; TSE‐HUA TAN,CD28 is a pivotal T-cell molecule that plays important roles in T-cell activation; HIV-1pathogenesis; and the induction and maintenance of peripheral tolerance andautoimmunity. The interaction of B7-1 and B7-2 on the antigen-presenting cells with CD28on the T cells provides a costimulatory signal that is critical in the activation of T-cellresponses.'Blocking CD28 function can inhibit T-cell activation with the antigen. It can alsodrive the T cells into a state of long-lasting antigen-specific unresponsiveness (anergy). TheCD28-mediated signal transduction pathway is distinct from the T-cell receptorKD3 signalingpathway. A characteristic of CD28 signaling is that it is resistant to the immunosuppressantcyclosporin A (CsA) but sensitive to the immunosuppressant rapamycin.

The contact angles of trapped steps,Bin Li; NC Bartelt; Ellen D Williams,Abstract During faceting of vicinal Si (111) surfaces misoriented towards the [11 2] direction;defect structures in the form of trapped steps are occasionally formed. Using scanningtunneling microscopy; we observe that the contact angle between steps trapped on (7× 7)reconstructed surfaces and the step bunches is a constant independent of the total miscutangle. If these steps are in local equilibrium; then the contact angle is governed by therelative step formation energies in the (“1× 1”) and (7× 7) phases. The measured value of theangle is 30±2°. From this value; the ratio between the step formation energies in the (1× 1)and (7× 7) phases is found to be 0.87±0.05.,Chemical physics letters,1994,4
Faceting in bond-oriented systems with icosahedral and decagonal symmetry,TL Ho; YH Li; WF Saam; JA Jaszczak,Abstract The recent discoveries of large facets in Al-Li-Cu and other icosahedralquasicrystals; as well as the observation of spatial disorder in these systems; show thatdisordered systems with long-range bond-orientational order can have growth facets. Afundamental question which naturally arises is whether such systems have equilibriumfacets. In this paper; we study the conditions under which a perfect bond-oriented systemcan facet at T= 0. The T= 0 equilibrium shapes of bond-oriented systems with icosahedraland decagonal bond-orientational order are discussed. An explicit example is presented toshow that disordered systems can have equilibrium facets at T= 0. We also give detailedderivation of the surface energy of quasicrystals.,Physical Review B,1989,4

New ultra-incompressible phases of NbB4 predicted from first principles,Xiao-Feng Li; Li-Gang Han; Yunshan Hou; Haiyan Yan; Zi-Yu Hu; Sheng-Li Zhang,Abstract Unraveling the specific structures of transition metal polyborides is critical forunderstanding their underlying physical and electronic properties. Using an ab initio particleswarm optimization algorithm for the crystal structure determination; we have predicted themonoclinic C 2/c and Amm2 phases as the stable structures for NbB 4. It is firstly found thatthe C 2/c phase transforms to Amm2 phase at about 42 GPa. Intriguingly; both phases aredynamically and mechanically stable at the ambient conditions. Furthermore; both phases ofNbB 4 have high bulk and shear moduli and a low Poisson's ratio and can be classified asultra-incompressible materials. Besides; the strong covalent bonding nature of NbB 4polymorphs was confirmed by the ELF analysis. We hope that these findings will stimulateexperimental work on synthesis of this technologically important material.,Physics Letters A,2017,3

Increased IGFBP-1 phosphorylation in response to leucine deprivation is mediated by CK2 and PKC,Niyati Malkani; Kyle Biggar; Majida Abu Shehab; Shawn Shun-Cheng Li; Thomas Jansson; Madhulika B Gupta,Abstract Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1); secreted by fetal liver; is a keyregulator of IGF-I bioavailability and fetal growth. IGFBP-1 phosphorylation decreases IGF-Ibioavailability and diminishes its growth-promoting effects. Growth-restricted fetuses havedecreased levels of circulating essential amino acids. We recently showed that IGFBP-1hyperphosphorylation (pSer101/119/169) in response to leucine deprivation is regulated viaactivation of the amino acid response (AAR) in HepG2 cells. Here we investigated nutrient-sensitive protein kinases CK2/PKC/PKA in mediating IGFBP-1 phosphorylation in leucinedeprivation. We demonstrated that leucine deprivation stimulated CK2 activity (enzymaticassay) and induced IGFBP-1 phosphorylation (immunoblotting/MRM-MS).

The model; based on the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation with periodicboundary conditions; applies to the light propagation in a twisted pipe waveguide; and to aBose-Einstein condensate (BEC) loaded into a toroidal trap; under the action of the rotatingnonlinear pseudopotential induced by means of the Feshbach resonance in aninhomogeneous external field. This is the difference from the recently considered similarsetting with the rotating linear potential. In the SF; SDF; and alternating regimes; four; three;and five different types of stable trapped modes are identified; respectively: even; odd …,*,2014,3

Helitron proliferation and gene-fragment capture,Yubin Li; Hugo K Dooner,Abstract Helitrons stand out as rare transposons discovered by bioinformatic; rather thangenetic; studies. Although they comprise an ancient superfamily of transposons found inplants; animals; and fungi; it is in plants where they have been studied most extensively.Well-annotated plant genomes contain increasingly higher numbers of identified Helitrons;including putative autonomous elements and nonautonomous elements with and withoutgene fragments. The molecular structure of the autonomous Helitron and the postulatedrolling circle mode of transposition remain hypothetical; and recent evidence suggests thatHelitrons may transpose by both copy-and-paste and cut-and-paste mechanisms. TwoHelitron properties; in particular; have caught the imagination of biologists: their ability toundergo sudden bursts of transposition and their ability to capture fragments from …,*,2012,3
Production of biodiesel in supercritical methanol and related correlation on phase equilibrium,Dan Zeng; Yang Li; Tao Fang,Abstract: Article Preview Article Preview Biodiesel was prepared by methyl esterification andeffects of different reaction conditions on the yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) wereinvestigated. The result of the orthogonal experiment analysis shows that the order ofinfluential factors is ranked as reaction temperature> methanol-to-soybean-oil (M/O) ratio>reaction time. The maximum yield of 94.8% has been achieved by reacting supercriticalmethanol and soybean oil in M/O ratio 4: 2 (v/v) at 573 K for 45 min. Moreover; the higherM/O ratio; the higher yield of FAMEs will be obtained. At the temperature ranging from 533 kto 573 k; the yield rises significantly; however; since soybean oil decomposes over 573 K;the yield decreases oppositely. Time longer than 45 min has less effect on the final yield. Inaddition; the phase equilibrium data of supercritical methanol+ C12 methyl esters and …,Advanced Materials Research,2012,3

The elicitor CSB I could also inducehypersensitive reaction in leaves of completely and highly incompatible rice; but not in theother two NIL rice (moderate incompatible rice and compatible rice). These resultssuggested that CSB I was cultivar-specific. Digestion with trypsin and boiling at 100℃ for 10min did not abolish the elicitor activity; whereas the complete loss of elicitor activity wasobserved after periodate treatment; which suggested that the carbohydrate moiety containedthe active site of the elicitor. The elicitor CSB I could maintain its activity of inducing POD …,Acta Phytopathologica Sinica,2004,3
Development and light response of leaves of Metasequoia and close relatives,Xiaochun Li,Abstract Metasequoia glyptostroboides is a useful nearest living relative (NLR) of theEocene fossil Metasequoia. Research on modern Metasequoia might give us some cluesabout its fossil counterpart. During this study the leaf anatomy of Metasequoia;Glyptostrobus; Sequoia and Taxodium was investigated with light microscopy andtransmission electron microscopy. Metasequoia exhibits several characteristics of typicalsciaphilic plants; such as slightly arched outer cell walls in the adaxial epidermal cells;strongly arched outer cell walls in the abaxial epidermal cells; mesophyll composed ofspongy cells; chloroplasts with well-developed grana not only in mesophyll cells but in boththe adaxial and abaxial epidermis. Based on comparison of leaf morphology and anatomy;we conclude that Metasequoia is best adapted to low light intensities; Sequoia and …,*,2004,3
Technique for the combining of double-clad optical fiber lasers,Xiaojun Li; Fei Luo; Stephen Bradley Ippolito; Theodore F Morse,High energy laser systems; both pulsd and CW; have become of significant interst in therecent past. To achieve higher powers in a laser system; it is often necessary to considermeans by which individual lasers can be made coherent with one another. This can beachieved through the use of a master oscillator concept; which can have problems withoverall stability; or by monitoring the phases of each individual laser and using feedbacktechnique that can be used to combine individual pumped fiber gain sources into a cavitywith a single output and a single set of longitudinal modes. We discuss the advantages ofend pumping of double clad fiber lasers and speculate on means by which an all-glassdouble clad fiber laser may be developed.,Advances in Fiber Lasers,2003,3

The differential expression of TRAF2; TRAF3 was not detected inRNA and protein level; whereas the expression of TRAF1 in HNE2-LMP1 cell lines wasmuch more abundant than that in HNE2 cell lines; suggesting that TRAF1 may be aninducible molecule; More importantly; TRAF1; TRAF2 or TRAF3 were activated in the HNE2-LMP1 cells; whereas TRAF1; TRAF2 or TRAF3 were not activated in HNE2 cells as detectedby the immunoprecipitation-Western blotting assay.,Virologica Sinica,2001,3
Effect of isoflurane on pulmonary surfactant synthesis in cultured primary alveolar type Ⅱ cells [J],Yong-Wang LI; Tian-De YANG; Qiao-Yi LIU,AIM To determine the effect of isoflurane (Iso) on pulmonary surfactant (PS) synthesis incultured primary ATⅡ cells. METHODS ATⅡ cells were isolated from adult rat lungs andused for the experiments after 32 h in primary culture. Iso 0.28 and 2 8 mmol· L-1 was addedinto the media of normal and H 2O 2 (75 μmol· L-1)-treated cells; and the cells were furtherincubated for 2 h. The cell proliferation was measured with MTT method and PS synthesiswith 3H-choline chloride incorporation. RESULTS Iso had no effect on the proliferation ofATⅡ cells; but markedly decreased PS synthesis in normal alveolar type Ⅱ cells; andaggravated the decrease of PS synthesis induced by H 2O 2. CONCLUSION Iso maydecrease PS synthesis of alveolar type Ⅱ cells in vitro; and aggravate the damage of thecells under peroxidation condition.,Chinese Pharmacological Bulletin,2000,3

The influences of crack closure on crack tip strain andCOD were also discussed. The results show that due to the crack closure and the residualcompressive stress; the strain is not a proportional relation to the square of loading value. Atthe initial loading stage; the crack closed and crack tip strain was not changed obviously.With increasing load; crack was opened graduatally from a distant place towards crack tip.After crack tip was fully opened; the strain increased rapidly.

Self-trapping under the two-dimensional spin-orbit-coupling and spatially growing repulsive nonlinearity,Rongxuan Zhong; Zhaopin Chen; Chunqing Huang; Zhihuan Luo; Haishu Tan; Boris A Malomed; Yongyao Li,Abstract: We elaborate a method for the creation of two-and one-dimensional (2D and 1D)self-trapped modes in binary spin-orbit (SO)-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs)with the contact repulsive interaction; whose local strength grows fast enough from thecenter to periphery. In particular; an exact semi-vortex (SV) solution is found for the anti-Gaussian radial-modulation profile. The exact modes are included in the numericallyproduced family of SV solitons. Other families; in the form of mixed modes (MMs); as well asexcited state of SVs and MMs; are produced too. While the excited states are unstable in allpreviously studied models; they are partially stable in the present one. In the 1D version ofthe system; exact solutions for the counterpart of the SVs; namely;{\it semi-dipole} solitons;are found too. Families of semi-dipoles; as well as the 1D version of MMs; are produced …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.01430,2017,2

Using numerical methods and the variational approximation; wedemonstrate that unstable Townes solitons; created by the contact attractive interaction; maybe completely stabilized (with an anisotropic shape) by the dipole-dipole interaction (DDI); inthe interval θ cr< θ≤ π/2. The stability boundary θ cr weakly depends on the relativestrength of the DDI; remaining close to the magic angle θ m= arccos (1/3). The resultssuggest that DDIs provide a generic mechanism for the creation of stable BEC solitons inhigher dimensions.,Physical Review A,2017,2
Directional release of the stored ultrashort light pulses from a tunable Bragg-grating microcavity,Shenhe Fu; Zhigui Deng; Zhen Li; Siqi Zhu; Peixiong Zhang; Hao Yin; Yongyao Li; Zhenqiang Chen,We demonstrate numerically the ability for directionally releasing the stored ultrashort lightpulse from a microcavity by means of two-pulse nonlinear interaction in a cascading Bragggrating structure. The setting is built by a chirped grating segment which is linked through auniform segment; including a tunable microcavity located at the junction between the twocomponents. Our simulations show that stable trapping of an ultrashort light pulse can beachieved in the setting. The stored light pulse in a microcavity can be possibly released; bynonlinearly interacting with the lateral incident control pulse. Importantly; by breaking thesymmetry of potential cavity; the stably trapped light pulse can be successfully released fromthe microcavity to the expected direction. Owing to the induced optical nonlinearity; thereleased ultrashort light pulses could preserve their shapes; propagating in a form of …,Optics express,2017,2
Maize defective kernel mutant generated by insertion of a Ds element in a gene encoding a highly conserved TTI2 cochaperone,Nelson Garcia; Yubin Li; Hugo K Dooner; Joachim Messing,Abstract We have used the newly engineered transposable element Dsg to tag a gene thatgives rise to a defective kernel (dek) phenotype. Dsg requires the autonomous element Acfor transposition. Upon excision; it leaves a short DNA footprint that can create in-frame andframeshift insertions in coding sequences. Therefore; we could create alleles of the taggedgene that confirmed causation of the dek phenotype by the Dsg insertion. The mutation;designated dek38-Dsg; is embryonic lethal; has a defective basal endosperm transfer(BETL) layer; and results in a smaller seed with highly underdeveloped endosperm. Themaize dek38 gene encodes a TTI2 (Tel2-interacting protein 2) molecular cochaperone.

Cross-symmetric dipolar-matter-wave solitons in double-well chains,Zhiwei Fan; Yuhan Shi; Yan Liu; Wei Pang; Yongyao Li; Boris A Malomed,Abstract We consider a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate trapped in an array of two-wellsystems with an arbitrary orientation of the dipoles relative to the system's axis. The systemcan be built as a chain of local traps sliced into two parallel lattices by a repelling lasersheet. It is modeled by a pair of coupled discrete Gross-Pitaevskii equations; with dipole-dipole self-interactions and cross interactions. When the dipoles are not polarizedperpendicular or parallel to the lattice; the cross interaction is asymmetric; replacing thefamiliar symmetric two-component discrete solitons by two new species of cross-symmetricones; viz.; on-site-and off-site-centered solitons; which are strongly affected by theorientation of the dipoles and separation between the parallel lattices. A very narrow regionof intermediate asymmetric discrete solitons is found at the boundary between the on-and …,Physical Review E,2017,2

Effective moisture diffusivity in wheat kernels during adsorption,Xingjun Li; Ping Jiang,Abstract Wheat samples with low (4.97–6.08%); normal (10.11–11.04%); and high (20.7–22.72%) initial moisture content (IMC; wet basis) were used to determine the rate of moistureadsorption by the gravimetric method at 10; 20; 25; 30; and 35° C under 65%; 86%; and100% relative humidity (RH); respectively. A moisture diffusion equation was modified to fitthe relationship between the moisture ratio of samples and exposure time. From 65% to100% RH; the IMC of wheat samples was inversely related to the moisture adsorption rate attemperatures from 10 to 35° C. Moisture adsorption rates of samples increased withincreasing temperatures. The moisture adsorption rate of samples with the same IMCincreased with increasing RH at a given temperature.

Microencapsulation of probiotics,Thierry F Vandamme; Gildas K Gbassi; Trinh Lan Nguyen; Xiang Li,Various definitions have been used to describe probiotics and their function in thehuman/animal system. Broadly defined; probiotics are live microbial food ingredients thatcan confer several health benefits to humans and animals. The committee of experts of theFAO/WHO Working Group describes probiotics as" live micro-organisms which; whenadministered in adequate amounts; confer a health benefit on the host"(FAO/WHO WorkingGroup; 2002). This definition; although widely adopted; is not acceptable to the EuropeanFood Safety Authority (EFSA) because it appears to embed a health claim that is notmeasurable (Rijkers et al.; 2011).

Nonlinear light propagation in cholesteric liquid crystals with a helical Bragg microstructure,Yikun Liu; Shenhe Fu; Xing Zhu; Xiangsheng Xie; Mingneng Feng; Jianying Zhou; Yongyao Li; Ying Xiang; Boris A Malomed; Gershon Kurizki,Abstract Nonlinear optical propagation in cholesteric liquid crystals (CLC) with a spatiallyperiodic helical molecular structure is studied experimentally and modeled numerically. Thisperiodic structure can be seen as a Bragg grating with a propagation stopband for circularlypolarized light. The CLC nonlinearity can be strengthened by adding absorption dye; thusreducing the nonlinear intensity threshold and the necessary propagation length. As theinput power increases; a blue shift of the stopband is induced by the self-defocusingnonlinearity; leading to a substantial enhancement of the transmission and spreading of thebeam. With further increase of the input power; the self-defocusing nonlinearity saturates;and the beam propagates as in the linear-diffraction regime. A system of nonlinear couple-mode equations is used to describe the propagation of the beam. Numerical results agree …,Journal of Optics,2015,2

Photon mapping for architectural daylighting simulation of interior spaces,Eric Li,ABSTRACT Tools currently available to architects for the purpose of lighting simulationemphasize photorealistic accuracy in their renderings. The sacrifice is in the time required togenerate these picture-perfect results. This wait can be very limiting; especially in aniterative design process. A more efficient tool can be seamlessly incorporated into anarchitect's workflow. This thesis explores and evaluates various types of modern renderingalgorithms. We consider the strengths and weaknesses of these algorithms and how they fitthe use case of an efficient daylighting simulator. To further push the efficiency of such tools;we investigate the use case of daylighting simulation and examine optimizations that can bemade to the algorithm based on our use case. We present a system developed with thepreceeding in mind. Leveraging the stream processing model of modern graphics cards …,M. Thesis Dept. Comp.

Selection of Data Smoothing Methods in Wheel Wear Analysis [J],Jun GUO; Xia LI; Xing DU; Xuesong JIN,In order to efficiently remove the noise points from the calculation data of wheel wear; acomparative investigation on three existing data smoothing methods; namely; five-spot triplesmoothing; cubic spline smoothing; and Supersmoother; was conducted by using these datasmoothing methods to deal with the wear data obtained from a wheel wear predicationmodel. The numerical results show that Supersmoother; which performs well in reducingnoise error from the calculated wheel wear data and can preserve the detail information ofthe wear data better; is more suitable for smoothing the wheel wear data than the other twosmoothing methods. Considering the stochastic fluctuation of wheel wear data; combinationof the cubic spline smoothing and Supersmoother was used to smooth the noises in weardata; which proves able to ensure the smoothness of curves and prevent data distortion.,Journal of Southwest Jiaotong University,2010,2

J Clin Invest,J Xu; G Li; P Wang; H Velazquez; X Yao; Y Li; Y Wu; A Peixoto; S Crowley; GV Desir,In the past it had been thought that the role of the kidney in the control of BP was adequatelydescribed by the paradigm of the volume–renin relationship (1). The concept implies thathypertension in general and hypertension specifically in patients with renal disease is theresult of sodium retention and the ensuing hypervolemia in the presence of aninappropriately high activity of the renin-angiotensin system. While the concept is certainlyvalid and in agreement with the data (2); it doesn't fully describe the pathogenesis ofhypertension in kidney disease (3).

Magnetic dimensional crossover in Pr-doped single crystal Bi2Sr2Ca0. 89Pr0. 11Cu2O8+ δ,HC Ku; CY Lin; Yung-Yuan Hsu; X-G Li; XF Sun,Abstract Magnetic hysteresis measurements on Pr-doped single crystal Bi 2 Sr 2 Ca 0.89 Pr0.11 Cu 2 O 8+ δ show a dimensional crossover from the three-dimensional (3D) vortexglass to the two-dimensional (2D) pancake of vortices. The observed crossover field H 2Dfor field applied parallel to the c-axis decreases from 6 kG at 5 K to 410 G at 25 K and 120 Gat 45 K. The substitution of 11% of magnetic Pr 3+ ions for Ca 2+ ions effectively decreasesthe hole concentration on the CuO 2 bi-layers but pushes the superconducting state from theoverdoped region to the optimum composition with a superconducting transition temperatureT c of 88 K. The lower crossover field H 2D values of the Pr-doped sample as compared withthe undoped Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ δ imply that the Josephson coupling between the twosuperconducting regions of adjacent CuO 2 bi-layers can be reduced by the presence of …,Physica B: Condensed Matter,1999,2
Long-term inositol phosphate release; but not tyrosine kinase activity; correlates with IL-2 secretion and NF-AT induction in anti-CD3-activated peripheral human T ly...,Richard G Bryan; Yongqin Li; R Katherine Totten; Mai Van; Tse-Hua Tan; Robert R Rich,Abstract The cascade of events within the first few minutes of T cell stimulation has been wellcharacterized. Although many second messengers have been shown to be necessary andsufficient for T cell activation in a number of model systems; the rate-limiting step inperipheral T cells has not been demonstrated. To model effective versus ineffective CD3-mediated stimulation in peripheral T cells; we used two anti-CD3 mAbs that differ in theirability to stimulate purified T cells: OKT3; which causes early second messenger generationbut is unable to activate T cells without a second signal; and 64.1; which stimulates T cellproliferation on its own. We found that tyrosine kinase activity was similar for both mAbs overa period of hours. However; the inositol phosphate response was stronger for 64.1 than forOKT3. To tie these events to gene activation; we measured NF-κB and NF-AT activity in …,Cellular immunology,1994,2

IGFBP-1 phosphorylation; which markedlyincreases its affinity for IGF-I; is regulated by mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) andcasein kinase (CSNK)–2. However; the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown.We examined the cellular localization and potential interactions of IGFBP-1; CSNK-2β; andmTOR as a prerequisite for protein–protein interaction. Analysis of dualimmunofluorescence images indicated a potential perinuclear co-localization betweenIGFBP-1 and CSNK-2β and a nuclear co-localization between CSNK-2β and mTOR.Proximity ligation assay (PLA) indicated proximity between IGFBP-1 and CSNK-2β as wellas mTOR and CSNK-2β but not between mTOR and IGFBP-1.

Dipolar bright solitons and solitary vortices in a radial lattice,Chunqing Huang; Lin Lyu; Hao Huang; Zhaopin Chen; Shenhe Fu; Haishu Tan; Boris A Malomed; Yongyao Li,Abstract Stabilizing vortex solitons with high values of the topological charge S is achallenging issue in optics; studies of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs); and other fields.To develop an approach to the solution of this problem; we consider a two-dimensionaldipolar BEC under the action of an axisymmetric radially periodic lattice potential; V (r)∼ cos(2 r+ δ); with dipole moments polarized perpendicular to the system's plane; which gives riseto isotropic repulsive dipole-dipole interactions. Two radial lattices are considered; with δ= 0and π; ie; a potential maximum or minimum at r= 0; respectively. Families of vortex gapsoliton (GSs) with S= 1 and S≥ 2; the latter ones often being unstable in other settings; arecompletely stable in the present system (at least up to S= 11); being trapped in differentannular troughs of the radial potential.

Jpn. 83; 034404 (2014); we designed a scheme of waveguide arrays withlong-range linear coupling effects and studied the bright solitons in this system. In this paper;we further study the dynamics of dark and grey solitons in such waveguide arrays. Thenumerical simulations show that the stabilities of dark solitons and grey solitons depend onthe normalized decay length and the scaled input power. The width of dark solitons and thegrey level of grey solitons are studied. Our results may contribute to the understanding ofdiscrete solitons in long-range linear coupling waveguide arrays; and may have potentialapplications in optical communications and all-optical networks.,Applied Sciences,2017,1
Evidence of VP1 of duck hepatitis A type 1 virus as a target of neutralizing antibodies and involving receptor-binding activity,Xiaojun Li; Ran Zhao; Wei Lin; Chenxi Li; Tingting Zhang; Fanyi Meng; Ming Liu; Yun Zhang,Abstract The VP1 protein of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a major target ofneutralizing antibodies and is responsible for viral attachment to permissive cells via anRGD motif. VP1 of duck hepatitis A type 1 virus (DHAV-1) does not contain any RGD motif.To investigate the antibody and receptor-binding properties of DHAV-1; VP1 has beenexpressed as a His fusion protein (His-VP1) in baculovirus system. Sera against His-VP1raised in rabbits effectively neutralized DHAV-1 infection in vitro and in vivo. A flow cytometrybinding assay indicated that His-VP1 bound to duck embryo fibroblast cell (DEF) surfacereceptors. This binding was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of purifiedDHAV-1 virions; demonstrating the specificity of this interaction. A separate cell-bindingassay also implicated His-VP1 in receptor binding. Importantly; anti-His-VP1 antibodies …,Virus research,2017,1

Unexpected superhard phases of niobium triborides: first-principles calculations,Xiaofeng Li; Junyi Du,Using an unbiased structure search method based on particle-swarm optimizationalgorithms in combination with density functional theory calculations; we investigate thephase stability and electronic properties of NbB3 under high pressures. By structuresearching as implemented in the CALYPSO code; we obtained the most stable monoclinicphase (C2/c) and four metastable phases (P63/mmm; C2/m; Pmm2 and Im2) for NbB3.Under high pressure; the C2/m structure transforms to Pmm2 phase and to Im2 phase atabout 29 and 46 GPa; respectively. Surprisingly; the five phases of NbB3 are all dynamicallyand mechanically stable at ambient conditions. The high bulk and shear modulus; and lowPoisson's ratio for both phases in NbB3; make it a promising low compressible material.Moreover; interestingly the hardness of the five phases of NbB3 are very close to 40 GPa …,RSC Advances,2016,1

Effect of point-like disorder on the vortex phase diagram in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8− δ in oblique field,M Konczykowski; CJ van der Beek; V Mosser; AE Koshelev; M Li; PH Kes,Abstract The phase diagram of vortex matter in the layered superconductor Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2O 8− δ exposed to a magnetic field oblique to the crystalline c-axis contains two first ordertransition (FOT) lines [1]. The first; H FOT m; separates the vortex solid from the vortex liquid;the second; H FOT ct; separates the combined lattice state in the vortex solid from a tiltedlattice state. The angular dependence of H FOT m in the tilted lattice region follows theanisotropic Ginzburg–Landau model [2]; allowing for the determination of the anisotropyfactor γ eff and the contribution of magnetic coupling to the mutual interaction of “pancake”vortices in the crossed lattice limit. The later parameter is directly related to the in-planepenetration depth λ ab. We investigate the evolution of the phase diagram of Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu2 O 8− δ in oblique fields with point-like disorder; introduced by irradiation with 2.3 MeV …,Physica C: Superconductivity and its applications,2010,1

Stability of the YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7− x− Si interface,Bin Li; Ellen D Williams,Abstract Electron spectroscopies were used to study the reaction of Si and SiO 2 layers withhigh-T c superconductors at room temperature and under annealing conditions. Thesuperconductor samples include YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 ceramic and thin film samples as well asGdBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 ceramic samples. The results show that the Si overlayers withdraw oxygenfrom the superconductor and form an interfacial layer of Si oxide at room temperature.Annealing increases the reaction rate so that films as thick as 30 Å become completelyoxidized following annealing above approximately 100 C. Ba segregates to the surface fromthe bulk after Si oxidation when annealed at temperatures higher than 200 C; while the rareearth element (Gd) does not segregate.,Journal of materials research,1991,1

Two-dimensional vortex quantum droplets,Yongyao Li; Zhaopin Chen; Zhihuan Luo; Chunqing Huang; Haishu Tan; Wei Pang; Boris A Malomed,Abstract: It was recently found that the Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) correction to the mean-fieldHamiltonian suppresses the collapse and creates stable localized modes (two-component"quantum droplets"; QDs) in two and three dimensions. We construct two-dimensional\self-trapped modes in the form of QDs with vorticity $ S $ embedded into each component. TheQDs feature a flat-top shape; which expands with the increase of $ S $ and norm $ N $. Anessential finding; produced by a systematic numerical analysis and analytical estimates; isthat the vortical QDs are\emph {stable}(which is a critical issue for vortex solitons innonlinear models) up to $ S= 5$; for $ N $ exceeding a certain threshold value.

Excited states of two-dimensional solitons supported by spin-orbit coupling and field-induced dipole-dipole repulsion,Chunqing Huang; Yuebo Ye; Shimei Liu; Hexiang He; Wei Pang; Boris A Malomed; Yongyao Li,Abstract It was recently found that excited states of semivortex and mixed-mode solitons areunstable in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with contact interactions.We demonstrate a possibility to stabilize such excited states in a setting based on repulsivedipole-dipole interactions induced by a polarizing field; oriented perpendicular to the planein which the dipolar BEC is trapped. The strength of the field is assumed to grow in the radialdirection∼ r 4. Excited states of semivortex solitons have vorticities S and S+ 1 in their twocomponents; each being an eigenstate of the angular momentum. They are fully stable up toS= 5. The excited state of mixed-mode solitons feature interweaving necklace structures withopposite fractional values of the angular momentum in the two components.

Spatiotemporal solitary modes in a twisted cylinder waveguide pipe with the self-focusing Kerr nonlinearity,Hao Huang; Lin Lyu; Maobin Xie; Weiwen Luo; Zhaopin Chen; Zhihuan Luo; Chunqing Huang; Shenhe Fu; Yongyao Li,Abstract: We study the spatiotemporal solitary modes that propagate in a hollow twistedcylinder waveguide pipe with a self-focusing Kerr nonlinearity. Three generic solitary modes;one belonging to the zero-harmonic (0H) and the other two belonging to the first-harmonic(1H); are found in the first rotational Brillouin zone. The 0H solitary modes can be termed asa quasi-1D (one-dimensional) temporal soliton. Their characteristics depend only on theenergy flow. The 1H solitary mode can be termed a quasi-2D (two-dimensional) bullet;whose width is much narrower than the angular domain of the waveguide. In contrast to the0H mode; the characteristics of the 1H solitary mode depend on both their energy flow andthe rotating speed of the waveguide. We demonstrate numerically that the 1H solitary modesare stable when their energy flow is smaller than the threshold norm of the\emph {Townes …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.03543,2017,*

Cross-symmetry breaking of two-component discrete dipolar matter-wave solitons,Yong-Yao Li; Zhi-Wei Fan; Zhi-Huan Luo; Yan Liu; He-Xiang He; Jian-Tao Lü; Jia-Ning Xie; Chun-Qing Huang; Hai-Shu Tan,Abstract We study the spontaneous symmetry breaking of dipolar Bose–Einsteincondensates trapped in stacks of two-well systems; which may be effectively built as one-dimensional trapping lattices sliced by a repelling laser sheet. If the potential wells aresufficiently deep; the system is modeled by coupled discrete Gross–Pitaevskii equations withnonlocal self-and cross-interaction terms representing dipole–dipole interactions. When thedipoles are not polarized perpendicular or parallel to the lattice; the crossinteraction isasymmetric; replacing the familiar symmetric two-component solitons with a new species ofcross-symmetric or-asymmetric ones. The orientation of the dipole moments and theinterwell hopping rate strongly affect the shapes of the discrete two-component solitons aswell as the characteristics of the cross-symmetry breaking and the associated phase …,Frontiers of Physics,2017,*
Spontaneous symmetry breaking of fundamental states; vortices; and dipoles in two-and one-dimensional linearly coupled traps with cubic self-attraction,Zhaopin Chen; Yongyao Li; Boris A Malomed; Luca Salasnich,Abstract We introduce two-and one-dimensional (2D and 1D) systems of two linearlycoupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPEs) with the cubic self-attraction and harmonic-oscillator (HO) trapping potential in each GPE. The system models a Bose-Einsteincondensate with a negative scattering length; loaded in a double-pancake trap; combinedwith the in-plane HO potential. In addition to that; the 1D version applies to the lighttransmission in a dual-core waveguide with the Kerr nonlinearity and in-core confinementrepresented by the HO potential. The subject of the analysis is spontaneous symmetrybreaking in 2D and 1D ground-state (GS; alias fundamental) modes; as well as in 2Dvortices and 1D dipole modes.(The latter ones do not exist without the HO potential.)

Exposure of decidualized HIESC to low oxygen tension and leucine deprivation results in increased IGFBP-1 phosphorylation and reduced IGF-I bioactivity,Majida Abu Shehab; Kyle Biggar; Sahil Sagar Singal; Karen Nygard; Shawn Shun-Cheng Li; Thomas Jansson; Madhulika B Gupta,Abstract Phosphorylation of decidual IGFBP-1 enhances binding of IGF-I; limiting thebioavailability of this growth factor which may contribute to reduced placental and fetalgrowth. The mechanisms regulating decidual IGFBP-1 phosphorylation are incompletelyunderstood. Using decidualized human immortalized endometrial stromal cells we testedthe hypothesis that low oxygen tension or reduced leucine availability; believed to becommon in placental insufficiency; increase the phosphorylation of decidual IGFBP-1.Multiple reaction monitoring-MS (MRM-MS) was used to quantify IGFBP-1 phosphorylation.MRM-MS validated the novel phosphorylation of IGFBP-1 at Ser58; however this site wasunaffected by low oxygen tension/leucine deprivation.

Pressure-induced phase transition of zinc nitride chlorine,Xiaofeng Li; Yaping Tao; Jian Lv; Ziyu Hu; Zhong-Li Liu,Abstract The phase stability of Zn 2 NCl is systematically studied by using the CALYPSOswarm structure searching method coupled with first principles calculations under pressureup to 100 GPa. The experimental ground state structure Pna2 1 (phase) is confirmed.Furthermore; two new high-pressure structures Pnma (16 atoms/cell; phase II) and R− 3m (4atoms/cell; phase III) are discovered. Phase I transits to phase II at 13.5 GPa and phase IItransits to phase III at 35.4 GPa. The phonon-dispersion and elastic constants calculationsboth show that the two structures are dynamically and mechanically stable in thecorresponding pressure ranges. Nevertheless the calculated electronic properties indicatethat three phases of Zn 2 NCl are semiconductors; pressure drives Zn 2 NCl to transformfrom a wide direct band gap semiconductor to narrow indirect one.,Computational Materials Science,2015,*
Dynamic fur on mobile using textured offset surfaces,Shaohui Jiao; Xiaofeng Tong; Eric Li; Wenlong Li,Abstract Fur simulation is crucial in many graphic applications since it can greatly enhancethe realistic visual effect of virtual objects; eg animal avatars. However; due to its highcomputational cost of massive fur strands processing and motion complexity; dynamic fur isregarded as a challenging task; especially on the mobile platforms with low computingpower. In order to support real-time fur rendering in mobile applications; we propose a novelmethod called textured offset surfaces (TOS). In particular; the furry surface is represented bya set of offset surfaces; as shown in Figure 1 (a). The offset surfaces are shifted outwardsfrom the original mesh. Each offset surface is textured with scattering density (red rectanglesin Figure 1 (a)) to implicitly represent the fur geometry; whose value can be changed bytexture warping to simulate the fur animation.

Animal models have shown that inactivation of prolyl-hydroxylases-regulators of HIF-suppresses mammary gland proliferation in vitro; with similarfindings in lung; brain; and hematopoietic cancer lines.

Flux-creep and depinning from columnar defects in layered superconductors,M Konczykowski; CJ van der Beek; V Mosser; M Li; PH Kes,Abstract Localization of vortex lines on columnar defects introduced in BSCCO: 2212crystals by heavy ion irradiation is supposed to enhance the critical current J c to thedepairing limit [1]. In experiments; the increase of the magnetic irreversibility is notaccompanied by suppression of flux creep; even at low temperatures. This impedes thedetermination of J c. Using the Hall-array technique; we have determined the dependence ofthe energy barrier for flux creep U on current density J at various temperatures and appliedmagnetic fields. On the basis of the functional form of U (J) dependence; we identify threeregimes of flux creep: from linear; Kim-Anderson like; at high currents; to logarithmic atintermediate currents; and power law at low currents. Critical currents determined from U (J)variations; lie orders of magnitude below the depairing current; indicating that the …,Physica C: Superconductivity and its applications,2010,*

Itsfunction however; is still far from understood on a microscopic level. Experiments [1] proposethat for the (latter) high temperature reactions (800-900 K); the active oxygen speciesis``bulk dissolved''. This scenario is different to recent findings for other metals which identifysurface oxides as being the important catalytic material [2].

A Molecular Dynamics Study of the Alignment of Silver Nano-Clusters on H-terminated Si (111),YF Shi; BQ Li; JM Zuo,Abstract Due to the growing need of device technology; the various behaviors of nano-clusters are becoming of great interest; ie growth; diffusion; coarsening; rotation and self-organization. We use molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to investigate the thermallyinduced alignment of silver nano-clusters on hydrogen passivated Si (111) surface. Thesilver-silver potential is treated by the embedded atom method (EAM). First-principlecalculation based on the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method (FPLAPW)is used to obtain the silver-hydrogen-silicon interaction energy. We fit this by a Lenard-Jonespotential; which corresponds to the interaction of silver with close-shelled H-bonded silicon.From MD; we obtain the atomic structure of this metal-silicon interface after thermalequilibrium is reached. The alignment process is studied under different temperatures …,APS Meeting Abstracts,2002,*

Investigation of the Nature of Atomic Oxygen Species at Ag (111): A DFT-GGA study,Weixue Li; Catherine Stampfl; Matthias Scheffler,Abstract It is recognised that the high activity of Ag for industrially important processes suchas the oxidation of ethylene to epoxide and partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde; islinked with the different oxygen species that form depending on the temperature andpressure; yet very little on a microscopic level is known. Using density-functional theory; theinteraction between Ag (111) and atomic oxygen (on-surface and subsurface); as well asbulk Ag_2O has been investigated. In all of the studied sites the binding energy of O to silveris weak; with oxygen preferring to adsorb on the surface up to about 1/3 ML. For highercoverages occupation of subsurface sites becomes energetically possible and also oxideformation. Both on-surface and interstitial-subsurface adsorption presents a repulsiveinteraction between O atoms; while substitution of O in an Ag site exhibits an attractive …,APS Meeting Abstracts,2001,*

An error resilience algorithm for H. 263++ based video coding,Li Qiang; Cui Huijuan; Tang Kun,Abstract Error resilience techniques have already been an important part of video coding inerror prone environments. In this paper; an error resilience algorithm is proposed forcompressed video sequences based on H. 263++. It applies several techniques includingdata partitioning; reversible variable length coding (RVLC) etc. Compared with H. 263++Data Partitioned Slice Mode (DPS Mode); our proposed coder can be fully bi-directionaldecodable with more RVLC words as well as data partitioned packets introduced in thebitstream. In addition; a decoding model has been presented for it. Simulations show that theproposed method outperforms the conventional ones (H. 263++ DPS Mode and H. 263) interms of PSNR under various error conditions; which significantly improves the quality of thereconstructed images.,Advances in Multimedia Information Processing—PCM 2001,2001,*

Drip-line nucleus of Z= 59 nuclei in the relativistic mean-field theory,Yong Zhou; Junqing Li; Zhongyu Ma; Baoqiu Chen,The possible neutron and proton drip-line nuclei and their corresponding properties of Prisotope chain are studied in the framework of the relativistic mean-field (RMF) theory withnon-linear meson self-interactions. The pairing effect is treated by BCS method and theisospin dependent pairing strengths have been adopted. The'blocking'method is used todeal with the last unpaired nucleon and the axially symmetric deformation is assumed. Thetheoretical results show that the nucleus 185 Pr could be determined as the last stablenucleus with respect to the nucleon emission on the neutron rich side from various aspects;while on the proton rich side; it is difficult to determine the proton drip-line nucleus in presentstudies. The reason is that on the proton rich side the Fermi surface increases faster towardsthe continuum state than that on the neutron rich side; where the BCS method fails; and …,High Energy Physics and Nuclear Physics,2000,*

The Solvents Effects on Intramolecular Energy and Electron Transfer of Porphyrin-phthalo cyanime Heterodimers,Li Xi-You; Tian Hong-Jian; Xu Hui-Jun,Abstract Intramolecular energy transfer and electron transfer of porphyrin-phthalocyanineheterodimers; linked by oxygen atom or piperazine in different solvents were investigated byfluorescence spectroscopy. The energy transfer and electron transfer efficiency werecalculated. It has been found that energy transfer occurred in competition with electrontransfer process depending on the polarity of the solvents. In polar solvents; electron transferprevails while the energy transfer is favored in nonpolar solvents. The driving force (△GET0) of the electron transfer reaction in different solvents was estimated using Rehm-Weller equation. The results indicated that the conformations of the heterodimers as well asthe ability of the solvent to stablize the charge-seperated state affect the photophysicalprocess greatly.

Evolution of Morphology During Etching of Si,Ellen D Williams; Elain S Fu; Bin Li,Abstract The step morphology of clean Si surfaces has been studied under conditions ofthermal etching in the temperature range 950–1250 C. Kinetic-bunching of steps is causedby direct current in the step-down direction around 950 C. By comparing the rate of thermaldecay of these structures with and without direct current; the electromigration force causingthis step bunching is estimated to be due to an effective charge of less than or approximately0.01 electron units. Around 1150 C; step-bunching is caused by direct current in the step-updirection. By analysis of the patterns of step structure; the effective charge of the driving forceis found to be approximately-0.1 electron units. Oxygen-induced etching of Si (001) and Si(111) has been studied in the temperature range of 700–900 C; and at a pressure of 5× 10−7 torr; conditions under which the surface is etched by the desorption of SiO.

Chiral phase transition in a model with dynamical spontaneous symmetry breaking at finite temperature and density.(In Chinese),En-Ke Wang; Jia-Rong Li,Abstract The chiral-symmetry-restoring phase transition in a model with dynamicalspontaneous-symmetry-breaking is discussed qualitatively; making use of an approximationmethod. The selfconsistency equation of the model is established. The condensation andmass of fermions as well as the temperature or density dependence of energy density andspecific heat are obtained. It turns out that; in this approximation; the chiral-phase-transitionis second order at zero chemical potential and finite temperature; and the transition is firstorder for both cases at finite temperature and density and at zero temperature and finitedensity; this moment. the transition temperature or density from broken phase to normalphase differs from that from normal phase to broken phase.,HEPNP,1990,*
