Type-based XML projection,Véronique Benzaken; Giuseppe Castagna; Dario Colazzo; Kim Nguyên,Abstract XML data projection (or pruning) is one of the main optimization techniques recentlyadopted in the context of main-memory XML query-engines. The underlying idea is quitesimple: given a query Q over a document D; the subtrees of D not necessary to evaluate Qare pruned; thus obtaining a smaller document D'. Then Q is executed over D'; henceavoiding to allocate and process nodes that will never be reached by navigationalspecifications in Q. In this article; we propose a new approach; based on types; that greatlyimproves current solutions. Besides providing comparable or greater precision and farlesser pruning overhead our solution; unlike current approaches; takes into accountbackward axes; predicates; and can be applied to multiple queries rather than just to singleones. A side contribution is a new type system for XPath able to handle backward axes …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,66
RDF analytics: lenses over semantic graphs,Dario Colazzo; François Goasdoué; Ioana Manolescu; Alexandra Roatiş,Abstract The development of Semantic Web (RDF) brings new requirements for dataanalytics tools and methods; going beyond querying to semantics-rich analytics throughwarehouse-style tools. In this work; we fully redesign; from the bottom up; core data analyticsconcepts and tools in the context of RDF data; leading to the first complete formal frameworkfor warehouse-style RDF analytics. Notably; we define i) analytical schemas tailored toheterogeneous; semantics-rich RDF graph; ii) analytical queries which (beyond relationalcubes) allow flexible querying of the data and the schema as well as powerful aggregationand iii) OLAP-style operations. Experiments on a fully-implemented platform demonstratethe practical interest of our approach.,Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on World wide web,2014,42
Types for path correctness of XML queries,Dario Colazzo; Giorgio Ghelli; Paolo Manghi; Carlo Sartiani,Abstract If a subexpression in a query will never contribute data to the query answer; thisshould be regarded as an error. This principle has been recently accepted into mainstreamXML query languages; but was still waiting for a complete treatment. We provide here aprecise definition for this class of errors; and define a type system that is sound andcomplete; in its search for such errors; for a core language; under mild restrictions on the useof recursion in type definitions. In the process; we describe a dichotomy among existentialand universal type systems; which is useful to understand some unusual features of our typesystem.,ACM SIGPLAN Notices,2004,34

Efficient and effective duplicate detection in hierarchical data,Luis Leitao; Pavel Calado; Melanie Herschel,Although there is a long line of work on identifying duplicates in relational data; only a fewsolutions focus on duplicate detection in more complex hierarchical structures; like XMLdata. In this paper; we present a novel method for XML duplicate detection; called XMLDup.XMLDup uses a Bayesian network to determine the probability of two XML elements beingduplicates; considering not only the information within the elements; but also the way thatinformation is structured. In addition; to improve the efficiency of the network evaluation; anovel pruning strategy; capable of significant gains over the unoptimized version of thealgorithm; is presented. Through experiments; we show that our algorithm is able to achievehigh precision and recall scores in several data sets. XMLDup is also able to outperformanother state-of-the-art duplicate detection solution; both in terms of efficiency and of …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,31
The Query Language TQL.,Giovanni Conforti; Giorgio Ghelli; Antonio Albano; Dario Colazzo; Paolo Manghi; Carlo Sartiani,Abstract This work presents the query language TQL; a query language for semistructureddata; that can be used to query XML files. TQL substitutes the standard path-based pattern-matching mechanism with a logic-based mechanism; where the programmer specifies theproperties of the pieces of data she is trying to extract. As a result; TQL queries are more'declarative'; or less 'operational'; than queries in comparable languages. This feature makessome queries easier to express; and should allow the adoption of better optimizationtechniques. Through a set of examples; we show that the range of queries that can bedeclaratively expressed in TQL is quite wide. The implementation of TQL bindingmechanism requires the adoption of non-standard techniques; and some of its aspects arestill open. In this paper we implicitly report about the current status of the implementation …,WebDB,2002,31
Efficient asymmetric inclusion between regular expression types,Dario Colazzo; Giorgio Ghelli; Carlo Sartiani,Abstract The inclusion of Regular Expressions (REs) is the kernel of any subtype checkingalgorithm for XML schema languages. XML applications would benefit from the extension ofREs with interleaving and counting; but this is not feasible in general; since inclusion isEXPSPACE-complete for such extended REs. In [9] we introduced a notion of" conflict-freeREs"; which are extended REs with excellent complexity behaviour; including a cubicinclusion algorithm [9] and linear membership [10]. Conflict-free REs have interleaving andcounting; but the complexity is tamed by the" conflict-free" limitations; which have beenfound to be satisfied by the vast majority of the content models published on the Web.However; the most important use of subtype checking is in the context of type-cheching ofXML manipulation languges. A type checker works by testing the inclusion of inferred …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Database Theory,2009,29

AMADA: web data repositories in the amazon cloud,Andrés Aranda-Andújar; Francesca Bugiotti; Jesús Camacho-Rodríguez; Dario Colazzo; François Goasdoué; Zoi Kaoudi; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract We present AMADA; a platform for storing Web data (in particular; XML documentsand RDF graphs) based on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure. AMADAoperates in a Software as a Service (SaaS) approach; allowing users to upload; index; store;and query large volumes of Web data. The demonstration shows (i) the step-by-stepprocedure for building and exploiting the warehouse (storing; indexing; querying) and (ii) themonitoring tools enabling one to control the expenses (monetary costs) charged by AWS forthe operations involved while running AMADA.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,26
Efficient inclusion for a class of XML types with interleaving and counting,Giorgio Ghelli; Dario Colazzo; Carlo Sartiani,Abstract Inclusion between XML types is important but expensive; and is much moreexpensive when unordered types are considered. We prove here that inclusion for XMLtypes with interleaving and counting can be decided in polynomial time in presence of twoimportant restrictions: no element appears twice in the same content model; and Kleene staris only applied to disjunctions of single elements. Our approach is based on thetransformation of each such type into a set of constraints that completely characterizes thetype. We then provide a complete deduction system to verify whether the constraints of onetype imply all the constraints of another one.,International Symposium on Database Programming Languages,2007,24
Subtyping recursive types in kernel fun,Dario Colazzo; Giorgio Ghelli,The problem of defining and checking a subtype relation between recursive types wasstudied in Armadio and Cardelli (1993) for a first order type system; but for second ordersystems; which combine subtyping and parametric polymorphism; only negative results areknown. This paper studies the problem of subtype checking for recursive types in systemkernel Fun; a typed/spl lambda/-calculus with subtyping and bounded second orderpolymorphism. Along the lines of Armadio and Cardelli (1993); we study the definition of asubtype relation over kernel Fun recursive types; and then we present a subtyping algorithmwhich is sound and complete with respect to this relation. We show that the naturalextension of the techniques introduced in Armadio and Cardelli (1993) to compare first orderrecursive types gives a non complete algorithm.

Type based discretionary access control,Michele Bugliesi; Dario Colazzo; Silvia Crafa,Abstract Discretionary Access Control (DAC) systems provide powerful mechanisms forresource management based on the selective distribution of capabilities to selected classesof principals. We study a type-based theory of DAC models for concurrent and distributedsystems represented as terms of Cardelli; Ghelli and Gordon's pi calculus with groups [2]. Inour theory; groups play the rôle of principals; and the structure of types allows fine-grainedmechanisms to be specified to govern the transmission of names; to bound the (iterated) re-transmission of capabilities; to predicate their use on the inability to pass them to thirdparties;... and more. The type system relies on subtyping to help achieve a selectivedistribution of capabilities; based on the groups in control of the communication channels.Type preservation provides the basis for a safety theorem stating that in well-typed …,International Conference on Concurrency Theory,2004,22
Building large XML stores in the Amazon cloud,Jesús Camacho-Rodríguez; Dario Colazzo; Ioana Manolescu,It has been by now widely accepted that an increasing part of the world's interesting data iseither shared through the Web or directly produced through and for Web platforms usingformats like XML (structured documents). We present a scalable store for managing a largecorpora of XML documents built on top of off-the-shelf cloud infrastructure. We implementdifferent indexing strategies to evaluate a query workload over the stored documents in thecloud. Moreover; each strategy presents different trade-offs between efficiency in queryanswering and cost for storing the index.,Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,20
Processing XML queries and updates on map/reduce clusters,Nicole Bidoit; Dario Colazzo; Noor Malla; Federico Ulliana; Maurizio Nolè; Carlo Sartiani,Abstract In this demo we will showcase a research prototype for processing queries andupdates on large XML documents. The prototype is based on the idea of statically anddynamically partitioning the input document; so to distribute the computing load among themachines of a Map/Reduce cluster. Attendees will be able to run predefined queries andupdates on documents conforming to the XMark schema; as well as to submit their ownqueries and updates.,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,19
Linear time membership in a class of regular expressions with interleaving and counting,Giorgio Ghelli; Dario Colazzo; Carlo Sartiani,Abstract The extension of Regular Expressions (REs) with an interleaving (shuffle) operatorhas been proposed in many occasions; since it would be crucial to deal with unordereddata. However; interleaving badly affects the complexity of basic operations; and; expecially;makes membership NP-hard [13]; which is unacceptable for most uses of REs. REs form thebasis of most XML type languages; such as DTDs and XML Schema types; and XDuce types[16; 11]. In this context; the interleaving operator would be a natural addition to the languageof REs; as witnessed by the presence of limited forms of interleaving in XSD (the all group);Relax-NG; and SGML; provided that the NP-hardness of membership could be avoided.,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2008,19
A typed text retrieval query language for XML documents,Dario Colazzo; Carlo Sartiani; Antonio Albano; Paolo Manghi; Giorgio Ghelli; Luca Lini; Michele Paoli,Abstract XML is nowadays considered the standard meta-language for document markupand data representation. XML is widely employed in Web-related applications as well as indatabase applications; and there is also a growing interest for it by the literary community todevelop tools for supporting document-oriented retrieval operations. The purpose of thisarticle is to show the basic new requirements of this kind of applications and to present themain features of a typed query language; called Tequyla-TX; designed to support them.,Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology,2002,17
Projection for XML update optimization,Mohamed-Amine Baazizi; Nicole Bidoit; Dario Colazzo; Noor Malla; Marina Sahakyan,Abstract While projection techniques have been extensively investigated for XML querying;we are not aware of applications to XML updating.

Efficient encoding of temporal xml documents,Mohamed-Amine Baazizi; Nicole Bidoit-Tollu; Dario Colazzo,The management of temporal data is a crucial issue in many applications. Recently; XMLhas become the standard for data exchange and representation. Consequently; importantefforts have been made on the development of temporal extensions for XML. This paperinvestigates how to generate or maintain space-efficient time-stamped documents. Weformally define a notion of compactness which allows for comparing documents. Then; wepresent two methods. For the first one; called general method; no restriction is made on theevolution of the XML documents whereas for the second one; called update-based method;changes are assumed to be specified by updates. For both methods; the issue is to enableprocessing very large documents; to use existing engines and to comply to Xquery UpdateFacility. The two methods are compared in terms of space-efficiency.

Precision and complexity of XQuery type inference,Dario Colazzo; Carlo Sartiani,Abstract A key feature of XQuery is its type system. Any language expression is staticallytyped and its type is used during program type-checking. In XQuery; types of input data andfunctions are defined in terms of regular expression types; but it is quite easy to write queriesthat generate non-regular languages. As a consequence; any type system for XQuery has torely on a type inference process that approximates the (possibly non-regular) output type ofa query with a regular type. This approximation process; while mandatory and unavoidable;may significantly decrease the precision of the inferred types.,Proceedings of the 13th international ACM SIGPLAN symposium on Principles and practices of declarative programming,2011,12

Specifically; the chapter will provide a review of variousproposals for XML document updates; their different semantics and their handling of updatesequences; with a focus on the XQuery Update proposal. Approaches and specific issuesconcerned with schema updates will then be reviewed. Document and schema versioningwill be considered. Finally; a review of the degree and limitations of update support inexisting DBMSs will be discussed.,Advanced applications and structures in XML Processing: Label stream; semantics utilization and data query technologies,2010,12
Subtyping recursion and parametric polymorphism in kernel fun,Dario Colazzo; Giorgio Ghelli,Abstract We study subtype checking for recursive types in system kernel Fun; a typed λ-calculus with subtyping and bounded second-order polymorphism. Along the lines of [ACMTransactions on Programming Languages and Systems; 15 (4);(1993) 575]; we define asubtype relation over kernel Fun recursive types; and prove it to be transitive. We then showthat the natural extension of the algorithm introduced in [loc. cit] to compare first-orderrecursive types yields a non complete algorithm. Finally; we prove the completeness andcorrectness of a different algorithm; which lends itself to efficient implementations.,Information and Computation,2005,12
A type system for querying XML documents,Antonio Albano; Dario Colazzo; Giorgio Ghelli; Paolo Manghi; Carlo Sartiani,In the last few years; the trend of publishing and sharing information on the World Wide Webcaused much of the existing electronic data to lay outside of database management systemsin the form of so-called Web documents. This process was further eased by the introductionof the (XML) by the(W3C); which provided a standard format for Web-documents. eXtensibleMarkup Language World Wide Web Consortium XML documents consist of textualinformation organized according to a tagged tree structure; which can be easily employedfor representing both structured data and document-like information. Thus; XML representsthe first concrete example of integration between the traditionally separated fields ofdocument technology and databases.

Web data indexing in the cloud: efficiency and cost reductions,Jesús Camacho-Rodríguez; Dario Colazzo; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract An increasing part of the world's data is either shared through the Web or directlyproduced through and for Web platforms; in particular using structured formats like XML orJSON. Cloud platforms are interesting candidates to handle large data repositories; due totheir elastic scaling properties. Popular commercial clouds provide a variety of sub-systemsand primitives for storing data in specific formats (files; key-value pairs etc.) as well asdedicated sub-systems for running and coordinating execution within the cloud. We proposean architecture for warehousing large-scale Web data; in particular XML; in a commercialcloud platform; specifically; Amazon Web Services. Since cloud users support monetarycosts directly connected to their consumption of cloud resources; we focus on indexingcontent in the cloud. We study the applicability of several indexing strategies; and show …,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,11
Linear inclusion for XML regular expression types,Dario Colazzo; Giorgio Ghelli; Luca Pardini; Carlo Sartiani,Abstract Type inclusion is a fundamental operation in every type-checking compiler; but it isquite expensive for XML manipulation languages. We recently presented an inclusionchecking algorithm for an expressive family of XML type languages which is polynomial; butruns in quadratic time both in the best and in the worst cases. We present here an algorithmthat has a linear-time backbone; and resorts to the quadratic approach for some specificparts of the compared types. Our experiments show that the new algorithm typically runs inlinear time; hence can be used as a building block for a practical type-checking compiler.,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,11
Path Correctness for XML Queries: Characterization and Static Type Checking,Dario Colazzo,Abstract In the last few years the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) has become the defacto standard for Web data representation. As a consequence; many languages have beenproposed to query and processing XML data. For these languages; the type systemsproposed up to now only analyze the result types; disregarding; to a large extent; thenavigation-correctness problem. In this dissertation we formally define a notion of navigation-correctness for an abstract XML typed query language; and then we study the problem ofstatically checking the proposed notion of correctness. Unlike other approaches; we definequery correctness in terms of dynamic semantics of the query language; and then formallystudy how this notion relates with two possible type systems.,*,2004,11
Partitioning XML documents for iterative queries,Nicole Bidoit; Dario Colazzo; Noor Malla; Carlo Sartiani,Abstract This paper presents an XML partitioning technique that allows main-memory queryengines to process a class of XQuery queries; that we dub iterative queries; on arbitrarilylarge input documents. We provide a static analysis technique to recognize these queries.The static analysis is based on paths extracted from queries and does not need additionalschema information. We then provide an algorithm using path information for partitioning theinput documents of iterative queries. This algorithm admits a streaming implementation;whose effectiveness is experimentally validated.,Proceedings of the 16th International Database Engineering & Applications Sysmposium,2012,10
Type-based detection of XML query-update independence,Nicole Bidoit-Tollu; Dario Colazzo; Federico Ulliana,Abstract This paper presents a novel static analysis technique to detect XML query-updateindependence; in the presence of a schema. Rather than types; our system infers chains oftypes. Each chain represents a path that can be traversed on a valid document duringquery/update evaluation. The resulting independence analysis is precise; although it raisesa challenging issue: recursive schemas may lead to inference of infinitely many chains.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,10

This paper builds on the previous one and provides a tableau proof technique forconstraint satisfiability testing in the presence of schemas.,Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science,2007,10
Schema inference for massive JSON datasets,Mohamed-Amine Baazizi; Houssem Ben Lahmar; Dario Colazzo; Giorgio Ghelli; Carlo Sartiani,Recent years have seen the widespread use of JSON as a data format to represent massivedata collections. JSON data collections are usually schemaless. While this ensures severaladvantages; the absence of schema information has important negative consequences: thecorrectness of complex queries and programs cannot be statically checked; users cannotrely on schema information to quickly figure out structural properties that could speed up theformulation of correct queries; and many schema-based optimizations are not possible. Inthis paper we deal with the problem of inferring a schema from massive JSON data sets. Wefirst identify a JSON type language which is simple and; at the same time; expressiveenough to capture irregularities and to give complete structural information about input data.We then present our main contribution; which is the design of a schema inference …,Extending Database Technology (EDBT),2017,9
Detection of corrupted schema mappings in XML data integration systems,Dario Colazzo; Carlo Sartiani,Abstract In modern data integration scenarios; many remote data sources are located on theWeb and are accessible only through forms or Web services; and no guarantee is givenabout their stability. In these contexts the detection of corrupted mappings; as aconsequence of a change in the source or in the target schema; is a key problem. Acorrupted mapping fails in matching the target or the source schema; hence it is not able totransform data conforming to a schema S into data conforming to a schema T; nor it can beused for effective query reformulation.,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT),2009,9
A type system for discretionary access control,Michele Bugliesi; Dario Colazzo; Silvia Crafa; Damiano Macedonio,Abstract Discretionary Access Control (DAC) systems provide powerful resourcemanagement mechanisms based on the selective distribution of capabilities to selectedclasses of principals. We study a type-based theory of DAC models for a process calculusthat extends Cardelli; Ghelli and Gordon's pi-calculus with groups (Cardelli et al. 2005). Inour theory; groups play the role of principals and form the unit of abstraction for our accesscontrol policies; and types allow the specification of fine-grained access control policies togovern the transmission of names; bound the (iterated) re-transmission of capabilities andpredicate their use on the inability to pass them to third parties. The type system relies onsubtyping to achieve a selective distribution of capabilities to the groups that control thecommunication channels.

In these systems; the detection of corrupted mappings is akey problem. A corrupted mapping fails in matching the target or the source schema; henceit is not able to transform data conforming to a schema S_i into data conforming to a schemaS_j; nor it can be used for effective query reformulation.

Paxquery: Efficient parallel processing of complex xquery,Jesús Camacho-Rodríguez; Dario Colazzo; Ioana Manolescu,Increasing volumes of data are being produced and exchanged over the Web; in particularin tree-structured formats such as XML or JSON. This leads to a need of highly scalablealgorithms and tools for processing such data; capable to take advantage of massivelyparallel processing platforms. This work considers the problem of efficiently parallelizing theexecution of complex nested data processing; expressed in XQuery. We provide novelalgorithms showing how to translate such queries into PACT; a recent frameworkgeneralizing MapReduce in particular by supporting many-input tasks. We present the firstformal translation of complex XQuery algebraic expressions into PACT plans; anddemonstrate experimentally the efficiency and scalability of our approach.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,8

Typing massive json datasets,Dario Colazzo; Giorgio Ghelli; Carlo Sartiani,Abstract Cloud-specific languages are usually untyped; and no guarantees about thecorrectness of complex jobs can be statically obtained. Datasets too are usually untyped andno schema information is needed for their manipulation. In this paper we sketch a typingalgorithm for JSON datasets. Our approach can be used to infer a succinct type from scratchfor a collection of JSON objects; as well as to validate a dataset against a human-designedtype and; if necessary; to adapt and improve this type.,International Workshop on Cross-model Language Design and Implementation,2012,7

Typechecking queries for maintaining schema mappings in XML P2P databases,Dario Colazzo; Carlo Sartiani,Abstract Peer data management systems (PDMSs) for XML data allow the user to easilyshare and query XML data dispersed over multitudes of sites without the complex and heavyadministrative tasks that characterize traditional distributed database systems. Most of themare based on a common model; where nodes in the system are connected through sparsepoint-to-point mappings; and queries are executed with decentralized versions of GAV andLAV query reformulation algorithms. The presence of links among peers poses newproblems related to the intrinsically dynamic nature of p2p systems; namely the fact thatpeers may join and leave the network at any time; as well as locally and independentlychange their data and schemas. As a consequence; mappings may suddenly becomecorrupted; hence greatly affecting the quality of results retrieved by the system.

Types for Correctness of Queries over Semistructured Data.,Dario Colazzo; Giorgio Ghelli; Paolo Manghi; Carlo Sartiani,Abstract A type system for a query language should serve both purposes of verifyingwhether a query is coherent with what is known about the structure of the database (querycorrectness) and of giving information about the type of the query result (result analysis).Current proposals for typed query languages for semistructured data are usually focused onresult analysis; but perform very few controls; or none at all; of query correctness. This workpresents a type system for a core of XQuery that supports both query correctness and resultanalysis; and discusses some of the design issues and alternatives.,WebDB,2002,7
Almost-linear inclusion for XML regular expression types,Dario Colazzo; Giorgio Ghelli; Luca Pardini; Carlo Sartiani,Abstract Type inclusion is a fundamental operation in every type-checking compiler; but it isquite expensive for XML manipulation languages. A polynomial inclusion checkingalgorithm for an expressive family of XML type languages is known; but it runs in quadratictime both in the best and in the worst cases. We present here an algorithm that has a linear-time backbone; and resorts to the quadratic approach for some specific parts of thecompared types. Our experiments show that the new algorithm is much faster than thequadratic one; and that it typically runs in linear time; hence it can be used as a buildingblock for a practical type-checking compiler.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2013,6
Error mining for regular expression patterns,Giuseppe Castagna; Dario Colazzo; Alain Frisch,Abstract In the design of type systems for XML programming languages based on regularexpression types and patterns the focus has been over result analysis; with the main aim ofstatically checking that a transformation always yields data of an expected output type. Whilebeing crucial for correct program composition; result analysis is not sufficient to guaranteethat patterns used in the transformation are correct. In this paper we motivate the need ofstatic detection of incorrect patterns; and provide a formal characterization based on patternmatching operational semantics; together with locally exact type analysis techniques tostatically detect them.,Italian conference on Theoretical Computer Science,2005,6

Efficient asymmetric inclusion of regular expressions with interleaving and counting for XML type-checking,Dario Colazzo; Giorgio Ghelli; Luca Pardini; Carlo Sartiani,Abstract The inclusion of Regular Expressions (REs) is the kernel of any type-checkingalgorithm for XML manipulation languages. XML applications would benefit from theextension of REs with interleaving and counting; but this is not feasible in general; sinceinclusion is EXPSPACE-complete for such extended REs. In Colazzo et al.(2009)[1] weintroduced a notion of “conflict-free REs”; which are extended REs with excellent complexitybehaviour; including a polynomial inclusion algorithm [1] and linear membership (Ghelli etal.; 2008 [2]). Conflict-free REs have interleaving and counting; but the complexity is tamedby the “conflict-free” limitations; which have been found to be satisfied by the vast majority ofthe content models published on the Web. However; a type-checking algorithm needs tocompare machine-generated subtypes against human-defined supertypes. The conflict …,Theoretical Computer Science,2013,5
Pattern by example: type-driven visual programming of XML queries,Véronique Benzaken; Giuseppe Castagna; Dario Colazzo; Cédric Miachon,Abstract We present Pattern-by-Example (PBE); a graphical language that allows users withlittle or no knowledge of pattern-matching and functional programming to define complexand optimized queries on XML documents. We demonstrate the key features of PBE bycommenting an interactive session and then we present its semantics by formally defining atranslation from PBE graphical queries into CQL ones. The advantages of the approach aretwofold. First; it generates queries that are provably correct with respect to types: the type ofthe result is displayed to the user and this constitutes a first and immediate visual check ofthe semantic correctness of the resulting query. The second advantage is that a semanticsformallyâ thus; unambiguouslyâ defined is an important advancement over some currentapproaches in which standard usage and learning methods are based on" trial and error" …,Proceedings of the 10th international ACM SIGPLAN conference on Principles and practice of declarative programming,2008,5

Warehousing RDF graphs,Dario Colazzo; François Goasdoué; Ioana Manolescu; Alexandra Roatis,Research in data warehousing (DW) has developed expressive and efficient tools for themultidimensional analysis of large amounts of data. As more data gets produced and sharedin RDF; analytic concepts and tools for analyzing such irregular; graph-shaped; semantic-rich data need to be revisited. We introduce the first all-RDF model for warehousing RDFgraphs. Notably; we define analytical schemas and analytical queries for RDF;corresponding to the relational DW star/snowflake schemas and cubes. We also show howtypical OLAP operations can be performed on our RDF cubes; and experiments on a fully-implemented platform demonstrating the practical interest of our approach.,Bases de Données Avancées,2013,4
Schemas for safe and efficient XML processing,Dario Colazzo; Giorgio Ghelli; Carlo Sartiani,Schemas have always played a crucial role in database management. For traditionalrelational and object databases; schemas have a relatively simple structure; and this easestheir use for optimizing and typechecking queries. In the context of XML databases; thingschange. Several different schema languages have been defined; tailored for differentapplication classes. Moreover; XML schema languages are inherently more complex; asthey host mechanisms for describing highly irregular and flexible structures. In this tutorialwe will describe the theoretical models behind these languages; their formal properties; andwill also present the complexity of the basic decision problems. We will explore sometheoretical and practical applications of schemas for query processing; finally; we willdiscuss how decision problems can be efficiently solved; at the price of some restrictions …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,4

Optimizing XML querying using type-based document projection,Véronique Benzaken; Giuseppe Castagna; Dario Colazzo,Abstract XML data projection (or pruning) is a natural optimization for main memory queryengines: given a query Q over a document D; the subtrees of D that are not necessary toevaluate Q are pruned; thus producing a smaller document D'; the query Q is then executedon D'; hence avoiding to allocate and process nodes that will never be reached by Q. In thisarticle; we propose a new approach; based on types; that greatly improves current solutions.Besides providing comparable or greater precision and far lesser pruning overhead; oursolution—unlike current approaches—takes into account backward axes; predicates; andcan be applied to multiple queries rather than just to single ones. A side contribution is anew type system for XPath able to handle backward axes. The soundness of our approach isformally proved. Furthermore; we prove that the approach is also complete (ie; yields the …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2013,3

Projection based optimization for xml updates,Nicole Bidoit; Dario Colazzo; Noor Malla; Marina Sahakyan,Abstract. XML projection is one of the main adopted optimization techniques for reducingmemory consumption in XQuery in-memory engines. The main idea behind this technique isquite simple: given a query Q over an XML document D; instead of evaluating Q on D; thequery Q is evaluated on a smaller document D′ obtained from D by pruning out; at loading-time; parts of D that are unrelevant for Q. The actual queried document D′ is a projection ofthe original one; and is often much smaller than D due to the fact that queries tend to bequite selective in general. While projection techniques have been extensively investigatedfor XML querying; we are not aware of applications to XML updating. The purpose of thepaper is to investigate a projection based optimization mechanism for updates.,ADBIS-Local proceeding,2009,3
Efficient subtyping for unordered XML types,Dario Colazzo; Carlo Sartiani,While XML is an ordered data format; many applications outside the document processingarea just drop ordering and manipulate XML data as they were unordered. In these contexts;hence; XML is essentially used as a way for representing unordered; unranked trees. Thewide use of unordered XML data should be coupled with a careful and detailed analysis oftheir theoretical properties. One of the operations that is mostly affected by the presence of aglobal ordering relation is semantic subtype-checking; ie; language inclusion. In anunordered context; inclusion has been proved to be inherently more complex than in theordered case: in particular; subtype-checking for ordered single-type EDTDs is in PSPACE;while the same operation for single-type EDTDs with unordered types is in EXPSPACE (thesame complexity result holds for unordered DTDs). Comparing two unordered XML types …,*,2007,3

Counting types for massive JSON datasets,Mohamed-Amine Baazizi; Dario Colazzo; Giorgio Ghelli; Carlo Sartiani,Abstract Type systems express structural information about data; are human readable andhence crucial for understanding code; and are endowed with a formal definition that makesthem a fundamental tool when proving program properties. Internal data structures of adatabase store quantitative information about data; information that is essential foroptimization purposes; but is not used for documentation or for correctness proofs. In thispaper we propose a new idea: raising a part of the quantitative information from the system-level structures to the type level. Our proposal is motivated by the problem of schemainference for massive collections of JSON data; which are nowadays often collected fromexternal sources and stored in NoSQL systems without an a-priori schema; which makes a-posteriori schema inference extremely useful.

Optimisation de Mises à jour XML par typage et projection,Nicole Bidoit; Dario Colazzo; Noor Malla; Marina Sahakyan,Abstract. La projection est une des techniques utilisées pour permettre de réduire lesbesoins en terme de taille mémoire nécessaire aux moteurs de requêtes XML" in-memory".L'idée sous-jacente à cette technique est simple: étant donnée une requête Q à évaluer surun document XML D; au lieu de procéder au calcul des réponses de Q sur D; la requête Qest évaluée sur un document D′; plus petit que D; obtenu lors du chargement de dernier enmémoire; par élagage des parties de D qui ne sont pas utiles pour Q. Le document Q′ quicelui sur lequel la requête Q est calculée; est une projection du document initial Q. Il estsouvent de taille drastiquement inférieure à celle de Q. Ceci est dû au fait que les requêtessont en général très sélectives.

A Source Centric Temporal Model,Dario Colazzo; François-Xavier Dudouet; Ioana Manolescu; Benjamin Nguyen,ABSTRACT Research in social sciences typically involves collecting and analyzing a corpusof information annotated with time and source information. Such applications need to modelwhen a given fact has happened; according to whom it has happened; and also when did agiven source claim a given fact; they may need to handle unknown; but constrained(bounded) moments in time. We present a generic source-centric temporal model; suited tothe information modelling needs of social sciences. We present the conceptual model; apossible XML representation; and demonstrate its usefulness on data and queries of a realapplication. We explain the advantages of our model over those currently employed intemporal; probabilistic; and provenance databases.,*,2008,1
Capturing well typed references in DTDs.,Nicole Bidoit; Dario Colazzo,Abstract Surprisingly enough; there has been few investigations for typing references ofsemistructured data and XML documents. This paper build on a previous proposal [7]introducing simple schemas with well-typed references and showing that such schemas;called normalized ref-schemas; are expressible as formulas of Hybrid Modal Logic. The aimof the present paper is to extend normalized ref-schemas in order to allow one for generalregular expressions and provide a fully general notion of schema capturing well-typedreferences; called ref-schemas. The main contribution of the paper is to show that ref-schemas are still expressible in Hybrid Modal Logic which entails that tools like for instancethe tableau system developed in [9] can be used in order to check for constraint satisfiabilityin presence of refschemas.,BDA,2006,1
An efficient algorithm for xml type projection,Dario Colazzo; Carlo Sartiani,Abstract In the contexts of data integration and data exchange; schema mappings areprimarily used for query answering. As a consequence; their maintenance and; in particular;the detection of corrupted mappings; ie; mappings that fail in matching the source and/or thetarget schema; is crucial. Corruption checking can be automatically performed by relying onan operation called type projection.

The Query Language TQL-Demo Presentation.,Giovanni Conforti; Giorgio Ghelli; Antonio Albano; Dario Colazzo; Paolo Manghi; Carlo Sartiani,Abstract This work presents the query language TQL; a query language for semistructureddata; that can be used to query XML files. TQL substitutes the standard path-basedpatternmatching mechanism with a logic-based mechanism; where the programmerspecifies the properties of the pieces of data he is trying to extract. As a result; TQL queriesare more 'declarative'; or less 'operational'; than queries in comparable languages. Thisfeature makes some queries easier to express; and should allow the adoption of betteroptimization techniques. Through a set of examples; which will presented at the SEBDdemo; we show that the range of queries that can be declaratively expressed in TQL is quitewide.,SEBD,2002,1

Linear Time Membership in a Class of Regular Expressions with Counting; Interleaving; and Unordered Concatenation,Dario Colazzo; Giorgio Ghelli; Carlo Sartiani,Abstract Regular Expressions (REs) are ubiquitous in database and programminglanguages. While many applications make use of REs extended with interleaving (shuffle)and unordered concatenation operators; this extension badly affects the complexity of basicoperations; and; especially; makes membership NP-hard; which is unacceptable in mostpractical scenarios. In this article; we study the problem of membership checking for arestricted class of these extended REs; called conflict-free REs; which are expressiveenough to cover the vast majority of real-world applications. We present several polynomialalgorithms for membership checking over conflict-free REs. The algorithms are allpolynomial and differ in terms of adopted optimization techniques and in the kind ofsupported operators. As a particular application; we generalize the approach to check …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2017,*

The most popular incarnation ofthis paradigm is the Map/Reduce architecture; first introduced by Google and then adoptedby companies like Facebook and Amazon. While cloud computing applications can bewritten in standard programming languages like Java or C++; there has been much work inthe development of special-purpose languages for the Cloud; such as Pig Latin [1] orSawzall [2]; that hide low-level details. Cloud-specific languages are essentially untyped;and no guarantees about the correctness of complex jobs can be obtained at static time …,*,*,*
Analyse statique et typage de données semi-structurées XML,Dario Colazzo; LAMSADE U Paris Dauphine; Federico Ulliana; Équipe GrapIK,XML est devenu le format standard d'échange et de représentation des données du Web. Lavitesse de croissance en terme de taille des données XML publiés dans le Web estdésormais vertigineuse; ce qui rende le traitement des données avec les systèmestraditionnels souvent impossible. L'optimisation par analyse statique consiste à raisonnersur l'efficacité et la correction des expressions XML avant de les évaluer; en visant lesmeilleures stratégies d'exécution. Les benefices de cette approche augmentent avec levolume des données à traiter; dont le fort intérêt à l'exploiter. L'étude des méthodesd'analyse statique exactes et approximées reste l'enjeu principal pour concevoir desnouveaux modules d'optimisation qui intègrent les moteurs d'évaluation de requêtes etmises à jour XML existents.,*,*,*

Static and provenance analysis for safe and efficient query evaluation on large data graphs. PhD project proposal,Dario Colazzo; LAMSADE-Univertité Paris Dauphine; Khalid Belhajjame,In recent years the database research community is dedicating more and more attention tothe problems related to the efficient management of graph data. The interest in this kind ofdata is motivated by the widespread diffusion of applications that manipulate and processdata that are naturally modelled as graphs: the most notable example of these application isrepresented by social networks like Facebook or LinkedIn; that daily process graphs withbillions of edges; but graph data are heavily used also in application contexts like trafficanalysis; crime detection and prevention; and bioinformatics. One of the models for graphdata that is gaining more and more interests in both the industrial and the research context isthat of data graphs. Data graphs are directed; labeled graphs having attributes associated tovertices and/or edges. This model is general enough to capture RDF property graphs and …,*,*,*
A Hough Transform Based On a Map-Reduce Algorithm,Abdoulaye SERE; Dario COLAZZO; Oumarou SIE,ABSTRACT This paper presents a method that proposes the composition of the Map-Reduce algorithm and the Hough Transform method to research particular features of shapein the Big Data of images. We introduce the first formal translation of the Hough Transformmethod into the Map-Reduce pattern. The Hough transform is applied to one image or toseveral images in parallel. The context of the application of this method concerns Big Datathat requires Map-Reduce functions to improve the processing time and the need of objectdetection in noisy pictures with the Hough Transform method.,*,*,*
par Jesús CAMACHO RODRÍGUEZ,Dario Colazzo; Donald Kossmann; Volker Markl,Depuis l'apparition de la toile mondiale (le Web); le volume et la vitesse de création desdonnées sont en plein essor. Les sites internet regroupant des données volumineusescomme les catalogues de produits; les sites de médias sociaux; RSS et tweets; blogs etpublications en ligne illustrent cette tendance. De plus les données du Web sont trèshétérogènes et sont produites dans divers formats (parfois complexes). Par conséquent; unepartie croissante des données intéressantes du monde sont partagées sur le Web oudirectement produites par et pour des plateformes Web. De nos jours de nombreusesorganisations reconnaissent la valeur de la richesse des données Web. Cependant; lestockage et le traitement de ces importants volumes de données hétérogènes (structurées;semi-structurées et non structurées) rencontrent un certain nombre de défis concernant …,*,*,*

Take What You Need: Efficiently Querying Semantic Web Data,Dario Colazzo; François Goasdoué; Ioana Manolescu,The “Web of Data” vision behind the initial World Wide Web project has found its most recentincarnation through the Semantic Web. More and more data sources are being exported orproduced as triples; using the Resource Description Format (or RDF; in short) modelstandardized by the W3C [1]. To exploit this wealth of data; the SPARQL query language hasbeen defined [2]; subsequently; novel techniques and algorithms have been proposed forthe processing of SPARQL queries; based on indexing [3]; efficient join processing [4]; andoptimized stores [5]; to name a few. The Oak team brings together Inria and University ofParis Sud faculty working on large-scale management of complex data. The team hasworked extensively on efficient algorithms for query processing on Web data. A class oftechniques of particular interest are based on data projection: the idea is to prune (restrict …,*,*,*

This process is analysed throughbargaining habits and through networks of actors who take part in it. The data collection isbased on infor mation about individuals who play the game: Who ar e they? In the name of whom do they talk? etc. Of ficial chats and for ums; web home pages and per sonal pages areexploited by ad hoc craw ling methods; and stored in an XML data war ehous e. This warehous e is based on the semi-structured database model; which is a flexible treepatternedschema; very different from the well-known classical relational tables and traditional datawarehousing techniques. This structure can impr ove the management of sociologicalinquiries; by allowing an evolutive strategy of querying; based on categorization. It …,*,*,*
