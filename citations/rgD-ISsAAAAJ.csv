Synthesis of N-doped graphene by chemical vapor deposition and its electrical properties,Dacheng Wei; Yunqi Liu; Yu Wang; Hongliang Zhang; Liping Huang; Gui Yu,To realize graphene-based electronics; various types of graphene are required; thus;modulation of its electrical properties is of great importance. Theoretic studies show thatintentional doping is a promising route for this goal; and the doped graphene might promisefascinating properties and widespread applications. However; there is no experimentalexample and electrical testing of the substitutionally doped graphene up to date. Here; wesynthesize the N-doped graphene by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. We findthat most of them are few-layer graphene; although single-layer graphene can beoccasionally detected. As doping accompanies with the recombination of carbon atoms intographene in the CVD process; N atoms can be substitutionally doped into the graphenelattice; which is hard to realize by other synthetic methods.

Length-dependent thermal conductivity in suspended single-layer graphene,Xiangfan Xu; Luiz FC Pereira; Yu Wang; Jing Wu; Kaiwen Zhang; Xiangming Zhao; Sukang Bae; Cong Tinh Bui; Rongguo Xie; John TL Thong; Byung Hee Hong; Kian Ping Loh; Davide Donadio; Baowen Li; Barbaros Özyilmaz,Abstract Graphene exhibits extraordinary electronic and mechanical properties; andextremely high thermal conductivity. Being a very stable atomically thick membrane that canbe suspended between two leads; graphene provides a perfect test platform for studyingthermal conductivity in two-dimensional systems; which is of primary importance for phonontransport in low-dimensional materials. Here we report experimental measurements and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of thermal conduction in suspended single-layer graphene as a function of both temperature and sample length. Interestingly and incontrast to bulk materials; at 300 K; thermal conductivity keeps increasing and remainslogarithmically divergent with sample length even for sample lengths much larger than theaverage phonon mean free path. This result is a consequence of the two-dimensional …,Nature communications,2014,350

Scotch-tape-like exfoliation of graphite assisted with elemental sulfur and graphene–sulfur composites for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries,Tianquan Lin; Yufeng Tang; Yaoming Wang; Hui Bi; Zhanqiang Liu; Fuqiang Huang; Xiaoming Xie; Mianheng Jiang,A new composite structure of graphene–sulfur with a high electrochemical performance isproposed. Scotch-tape-like sulfur-assisted exfoliation of graphite is developed to producethe graphene–sulfur composites and freestanding low-defect graphene sheets. The intimateinteraction between sulfur and graphene; attributed to the similar electronegativities of thetwo elements; is stronger than the van der Waals forces between adjacent π–π stackedgraphene layers. This causes cleavage of the graphene layers when the sulfur moleculesstick to the surface and edges of the graphite; similar to Scotch tape in micromechanicalexfoliation processes. This approach enables us to obtain graphene with an electricalconductivity as high as 1820 S cm− 1 and a Hall mobility as high as 200 cm2 V− 1 s− 1;superior to most reported graphene. Furthermore; the graphene sheets which uniformly …,Energy & Environmental Science,2013,146
Efficient synthesis of carbon nanotube–nanoparticle hybrids,XL Li; YQ Liu; Lei Fu; LC Cao; DC Wei; Yu Wang,Abstract A simple and versatile approach has been developed to synthesize different carbonnanotube (CNT)–nanoparticle hybrid materials. The strategy is based on the nondestructive(noncovalent) functionalization of pristine CNTs and the subsequent in situ synthesis of avariety of different nanoparticles; including metal; semiconductor; and insulator particles; onthe modified CNTs. This strategy has been demonstrated here with Pt; CdS; and silicananoparticles.

Localized low-weight graph and its applications in wireless ad hoc networks,Xiang-Yang Li; Yu Weng; Peng-Jun Wan; Wen-Zhan Song; Ophir Frieder,We propose a new localized structure; namely; Incident MST and RNG Graph (IMRG); fortopology control and broadcasting in wireless ad hoc networks. In the construction algorithm;each node first builds a modified relative neighborhood graph (RNG'); and then informs itsone-hop neighbors its incident edges in RNG'. Each node then collects all its one-hopneighbors and the two-hop neighbors who have RNG edges to some of its one-hopneighbors; and builds an Euclidean minimum spanning tree of these nodes. Each node ukeeps an edge uv only if uv is in the constructed minimum spanning tree. We analyticallyprove that the node degree of the IMRG is at most 6; it is connected and planar; and moreimportantly; the total edge length of the IMRG is within a constant factor of that of theminimum spanning tree. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first algorithm that can …,INFOCOM 2004. Twenty-third AnnualJoint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies,2004,109

Deregulation of miRNA genes was found in several types of cancers. Toexplore the role of the miRNAs in Chinese lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC); theexpression profile of 711 miRNAs in SCC was analyzed. Total RNAs were used forhybridization on a commercially available array (miRCURY LNA array v. 10.0); whichcontains 1;200 probes in tetramer; corresponding to 711 human miRNA genes. The resultsof miRNA microarray analysis were confirmed with quantitative real-time polymerase chainreaction. Seven human miRNAs (miR-126; miR-193a-3p; miR-30d; miR-30a; miR-101; let-7i; and miR-15a) were found to be significantly downregulated in lung SCC (P< 0.05);compared with normal lung tissues.

Regulation of Set9-mediated H4K20 methylation by a PWWP domain protein,Yu Wang; Bharat Reddy; James Thompson; Hengbin Wang; Ken-ichi Noma; John R Yates III; Songtao Jia,Summary Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me) is essential for recruitingcheckpoint proteins 53BP1/Crb2 to DNA lesions and subsequent activation of a DNA-damage checkpoint. In fission yeast; Set9 (spKMT5) catalyzes mono-; di-; and trimethylationof H4K20. However; the mechanisms that regulate Set9 function are poorly understood.Here; we identified a PWWP domain protein Pdp1 as a Set9-associated factor. Pdp1 bindsto histones and is required for Set9 chromatin localization. Yeast cells without Pdp1 weredeficient in all three states of H4K20me; sensitive to genotoxic treatments; and impaired inCrb2 recruitment. The PWWP domain of Pdp1 binds to H4K20me; and mutations within thePWWP domain that abrogated this interaction in vitro reduced both the association of Set9with chromatin and the extent of H4K20me in vivo. These results demonstrate that the …,Molecular cell,2009,95
A new method to synthesize complicated multibranched carbon nanotubes with controlled architecture and composition,Dacheng Wei; Yunqi Liu; Lingchao Cao; Lei Fu; Xianglong Li; Yu Wang; Gui Yu; Daoben Zhu,Here we develop a simple method by using flow fluctuation to synthesize arrays ofmultibranched carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that are far more complex than those previouslyreported. The architectures and compositions can be well controlled; thus avoiding anytemplate or additive. A branching mechanism of fluctuation-promoted coalescence ofcatalyst particles is proposed. This finding will provide a hopeful approach to the goal ofCNT-based integrated circuits and be valuable for applying branched junctions innanoelectronics and producing branched junctions of other materials.,Nano letters,2006,92

Photocatalytic activities of M2Sb2O7 (M= Ca; Sr) for degrading methyl orange,Xinping Lin; Fuqiang Huang; Wendeng Wang; Yaoming Wang; Yujuan Xia; Jianlin Shi,Abstract M 2 Sb 2 O 7 (M= Ca; Sr) photocatalysts were synthesized by a solid state reactionmethod. The results concerning methyl orange (MO) photodecomposition generally showthat the catalytic efficiency of Sr 2 Sb 2 O 7 is much higher than that of Ca 2 Sb 2 O 7 underUV light irradiation. The more open structure in Sr 2 Sb 2 O 7 is suggested to be responsiblefor its higher photocatalytic activity. In the investigation on pH-dependent photocatalysis overSr 2 Sb 2 O 7 catalyst; the pseudo-first reaction rate k was found to be increased by about sixtimes as the pH value decreases from 6.88 to 3.91. We believe that the decolorization of MOin neutral or alkaline conditions is primarily through a photocatalytic process; while the MOphotosensitization and photolysis mechanisms play more important roles in acidicconditions.,Applied Catalysis A: General,2006,87
A general preparation strategy for hybrid TiO2 hierarchical spheres and their enhanced solar energy utilization efficiency,Xujie Lü; Fuqiang Huang; Xinliang Mou; Yaoming Wang; Fangfang Xu,Titanium (IV) dioxide (TiO 2) is one of the most attractive d-block transition metal functionaloxides due to its unique physical and chemical properties. Many applications of TiO 2; suchas photocatalyst and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs); have been widely investigated.[1;2] To utilize solar energy efficiently; TiO 2 should be well-crystallized with a high surfacearea and promote charge separation as well as electron transport. To improve chargeseparation; TiO 2/semiconductor composites have proved successful;[3; 4] but efforts toenhance electron transport are less so due to the inefficient interface between TiO 2 and thesemiconductor. A new composite structure of TiO 2| semimetal| semiconductor isinvestigated here for solar energy applications.

MiR-96 downregulates REV1 and RAD51 to promote cellular sensitivity to cisplatin and PARP inhibition,Yemin Wang; Jen-Wei Huang; Philamer Calses; Christopher J Kemp; Toshiyasu Taniguchi,Cell survival after DNA damage relies on DNA repair; the abrogation of which causesgenomic instability. The DNA repair protein RAD51 and the trans-lesion synthesis DNApolymerase REV1 are required for resistance to DNA interstrand cross-linking agents suchas cisplatin. In this study; we show that overexpression of miR-96 in human cancer cellsreduces the levels of RAD51 and REV1 and impacts the cellular response to agents thatcause DNA damage. MiR-96 directly targeted the coding region of RAD51 and the 3′-untranslated region of REV1. Overexpression of miR-96 decreased the efficiency ofhomologous recombination and enhanced sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor AZD2281 in vitroand to cisplatin both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together; our findings indicate that miR-96regulates DNA repair and chemosensitivity by repressing RAD51 and REV1. As a …,Cancer research,2012,82
Facile fabrication of faceted copper nanocrystals with high catalytic activity for p-nitrophenol reduction,Pinhua Zhang; Yongming Sui; Guanjun Xiao; Yingnan Wang; Chunzhong Wang; Bingbing Liu; Guangtian Zou; Bo Zou,This article reports a reproducible and facile approach to synthesize faceted coppernanocrystals (Cu NCs) using an inexpensive copper oxide as a precursor. By simplyprolonging the reaction time; Cu cubes and polyhedrons were successfully produced; andthe mean size could be effectively controlled in the range of 9 to 21 nm. The catalyticactivities of the Cu cubes and polyhedrons were investigated by photometrically monitoringthe reduction of p-nitrophenol by an excess of NaBH4. The kinetics of the reduction reactionat different temperatures were investigated to determine the activation parameters. Ourinvestigations indicate that Cu nanocubes exhibit higher catalytic activity than Cupolyhedrons; which can be ascribed to three features: the higher surface-to-volume ratio; thehigher surface energy of the {100} facet; and the lower redox potential.

Determining factor of MoSe2 formation in Cu (In; Ga) Se2 solar cells,Xiaolong Zhu; Zhen Zhou; Yaoming Wang; Lei Zhang; Aimin Li; Fuqiang Huang,Abstract The MoSe 2 layers; as a necessary interface layer in Cu (In; Ga) Se 2/Mo for high-efficiency Cu (In; Ga) Se 2 solar cells; were observed to form in the Mo and CIGS/Mo filmsduring the selenization process. In order to reveal the determining factor of MoSe 2; thecorrelation of MoSe 2 thickness with the Mo sputtering pressure was investigated. The MoSe2 thickness increased with decreasing the sputtering pressure. Furthermore; thedependence of MoSe 2 thickness on the deposition time of SiO 2 layer and thecharacterizations of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopydemonstrate that the formation of Na 2 Se x compounds plays a determining role for theformation of MoSe 2 layer. The illuminated I–V characterization showed that the high seriesresistance of the CIGS solar cell was induced by too thick MoSe 2 layer.

In the experiments; the photocatalytic activity is in the increasing order ofCaWO 4< SrWO 4< BaWO 4 under both neutral and acidic conditions. The factors; whichinfluence the photocatalytic processes and the final activity; were analyzed the difference oftheir photocatalytic behaviors. The further investigation indicates that the higher structuralopenness degree; corresponding to a lower packing factor; leads to the better photocatalyticactivity.,Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical,2009,78

In this study; wedeveloped a highly multiplexed single-nucleus sequencing method to investigate copynumber evolution in patients with triple-negative breast cancer. We sequenced 1;000 singlecells from tumors in 12 patients and identified 1–3 major clonal subpopulations in eachtumor that shared a common evolutionary lineage. For each tumor; we also identified aminor subpopulation of non-clonal cells that were classified as metastable; pseudodiploid orchromazemic. Phylogenetic analysis and mathematical modeling suggest that these dataare unlikely to be explained by the gradual accumulation of copy number events over time.In contrast; our data challenge the paradigm of gradual evolution; showing that the …,Nature genetics,2016,76
Hint1 inhibits growth and activator protein-1 activity in human colon cancer cells,Lin Wang; Yujing Zhang; Haiyang Li; Zhiheng Xu; Regina M Santella; I Bernard Weinstein,There is accumulating evidence that histidine triad (HIT) nucleotide-binding protein 1(HINT1); a member of the evolutionary highly conserved HIT protein super family; is a noveltumor suppressor. However; the mechanism of action of HINT1 with respect to tumorsuppression is not known. In the present study; we found that a series of human coloncancer cell lines displayed various levels of expression of HINT1; with a very low level inSW480 cells. This cell line also displayed partial methylation of the promoter region of theHint1 gene; and treatment of these cells with 5-azadeoxycitidine increased expression ofHint1 mRNA and protein. Therefore; the decreased expression of HINT1 in SW480 cellsseems to be due to epigenetic silencing. Increased expression of HINT1 in these cells; usinga retrovirus vector (pLNCX2) that encodes either wild-type (WT) Hint1 or a point mutant …,Cancer research,2007,74

Observation of an intermediate band in Sn-doped chalcopyrites with wide-spectrum solar response,Chongyin Yang; Mingsheng Qin; Yaoming Wang; Dongyun Wan; Fuqiang Huang; Jianhua Lin,Abstract Nanostrcutured particles and polycrystalline thin films of Sn-doped chalcopyrite aresynthesized by newly-developed methods. Surprisingly; Sn doping introduces a narrowpartially filled intermediate band (IB) located~ 1.7 eV (CuGaS 2) and~ 0.8 eV (CuInS 2)above the valance band maximum in the forbidden band gap. Diffuse reflection spectra andphotoluminescence spectra reveal extra absorption and emission spectra induced by theIBs; which are further supported by first-principle calculations. Wide spectrum solar responsegreatly enhances photocatalysis; photovoltaics; and photo-induced hydrogen productiondue to the intermediate band.,Scientific reports,2013,61

Identification and characterization of C‐terminal fragments of the beta‐amyloid precursor produced in cell culture.,D Wolf; D Quon; Y Wang; B Cordell,Abstract The mechanism of amyloid formation in Alzheimer's disease is unknown butappears to involve proteolytic processing of the amyloidogenic peptide from a largerprecursor. When the C-terminus containing the amyloid-forming and cytoplasmic domains ofthe precursor was recombinantly expressed in cultured mammalian cells; a 16 kd proteinaccumulated which had a tendency to aggregate and form deposits. These deposits hadphysical characteristics resembling those of preamyloid. Recombinant expression of the full-length precursor was found to produce a similar; cell-associated 16 kd C-terminal fragmentas well as a 12 kd fragment; neither of which formed detectable aggregates suggestingefficient catabolism of these fragments.

Real time and in situ control of the gap size of nanoelectrodes for molecular devices,Dacheng Wei; Yunqi Liu; Lingchao Cao; Yu Wang; Hongliang Zhang; Gui Yu,Molecular electronics is often limited by the lack of a simple method to fabricatenanoelectrodes with controlled gap size. This is partly attributed to the lack of a real timecharacterization in the fabrication. Here; we report a new method based on an electroninduced deposition process operated in scanning electron microscopy that realizes in situand real time characterization in the nanoelectrode fabrication; thus the gap size can becontrolled easily and precisely. It is a clean and nondestructive process for carbon nanotube(CNT) electrodes. The mechanism is detailed. The nanoelectrodes have a π-conjugatedsurface due to the deposition of sp2-rich amorphous carbon. As an application; DNAmolecules are assembled between the CNT electrodes by π-stacking interaction for current−voltage measurement. Our result provides a feasible route to prepare nanoelectrodes …,Nano letters,2008,54
Functional uncoupling of the Janus kinase 3-Stat5 pathway in malignant growth of human T cell leukemia virus type 1-transformed human T cells,Robert A Kirken; Rebecca A Erwin; Lihua Wang; Yuling Wang; Hallgeir Rui; William L Farrar,Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) transforms cytokine-dependent T lymphocytesand causes adult T cell leukemia. Janus tyrosine kinase (Jak) 3 and transcription factorsStat5a and Stat5b are essential for the proliferation of normal T cells and are constitutivelyhyperactivated in both HTLV-1-transformed human T cell lines and lymphocytes isolatedfrom HTLV-1-infected patients; therefore; a critical role for the Jak3-Stat5 pathway in theprogression of this disease has been postulated. We recently reported that tyrphostin AG-490 selectively blocked IL-2 activation of Jak3/Stat5 and growth of murine T cell lines.

Emotional audio-visual speech synthesis based on PAD,Jia Jia; Shen Zhang; Fanbo Meng; Yongxin Wang; Lianhong Cai,Audio-visual speech synthesis is the core function for realizing face-to-face human-computercommunication. While considerable efforts have been made to enable talking with computerlike people; how to integrate the emotional expressions into the audio-visual speechsynthesis remains largely a problem. In this paper; we adopt the notion of Pleasure-Displeasure; Arousal-Nonarousal; and Dominance-Submissiveness (PAD) 3-D-emotionalspace; in which emotions can be described and quantified from three different dimensions.Based on this new definition; we propose a unified model for emotional speech conversionusing Boosting-Gaussian mixture model (GMM); as well as a facial expression synthesismodel. We further present an emotional audio-visual speech synthesis approach.Specifically; we take the text and the target PAD values as input; and employ the text-to …,IEEE transactions on audio; speech; and language processing,2011,51

There are no wired infrastructures or cellular networks inad hoc wireless network. In this chapter; we assume that each wireless node has an om—nidirectional antenna and a single transmission of a node can be received by any nodewithin its vicinity; which we assume is a disk centered at this node. We also discussspecifically the topology control when directional antennas are used. Each mobile node hasa transmission range. Node v can receive the signal from node u if node v is within thetransmission range of the sender it. Otherwise; they communicate through multihop wirelesslinks by using intermediate nodes to relay messages. Consequently; each node in the …,Mobile Ad Hoc Networking,2004,51

Microstructure evolution in the cemented carbides WC–Co I. Effect of the C/W ratio on the morphology and defects of the WC grains,Y Wang; M Heusch; S Lay; CH Allibert,Abstract The morphology and the interface features of WC grains are examined by SEM andTEM in cemented carbides WC-8 wt% Co. Three compositions—the mixture {WC+ Cobinder} and the mixtures with graphite or η—are studied after treatments at 1200 and 1450C. The effect of the C content is observed both on the WC crystal features and on themicrostructure evolution. In all the alloys; large faceted grains that are defect free singlecrystals are formed at 1450 C. On the C rich side; the increase in number and size of thelarge grains is more regular; the WC grains are more faceted and grow already duringheating. On the W rich side; the WC grains have slightly rounded corners and interfacesteps. The C content influence on the interface energy anisotropy and the growth process ofthe WC grains is discussed from the microstructure results.,physica status solidi (a),2002,50
Csi1 links centromeres to the nuclear envelope for centromere clustering,Haitong Hou; Zhou Zhou; Yu Wang; Jiyong Wang; Scott P Kallgren; Tatiana Kurchuk; Elizabeth A Miller; Fred Chang; Songtao Jia,In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe; the centromeres of each chromosome areclustered together and attached to the nuclear envelope near the site of the spindle polebody during interphase. The mechanism and functional importance of this arrangement ofchromosomes are poorly understood. In this paper; we identified a novel nuclear protein;Csi1; that localized to the site of centromere attachment and interacted with both the innernuclear envelope SUN domain protein Sad1 and centromeres. Both Csi1 and Sad1 mutantsexhibited centromere clustering defects in a high percentage of cells. Csi1 mutants alsodisplayed a high rate of chromosome loss during mitosis; significant mitotic delays; andsensitivity to perturbations in microtubule–kinetochore interactions and chromosomenumbers. These studies thus define a molecular link between the centromere and nuclear …,J Cell Biol,2012,49
Interleukin 4 regulates phosphorylation of serine 756 in the transactivation domain of Stat6 roles for multiple phosphorylation sites and Stat6 function,Yuling Wang; Maria Grazia Malabarba; Zsuzsanna S Nagy; Robert A Kirken,Abstract Lymphokines interleukin-4 (IL4) and IL13 exert overlapping biological activities viathe shared use of the IL4 receptor α-chain and signal transducer and activator oftranscription 6 (Stat6). Stat6 is critical for T-helper 2 cell differentiation; B-cell Ig class switch;and allergic diseases; thus; understanding its regulation is of central importance.Phosphorylation is crucial for Stat activity. Whereas Stat6 is phosphorylated on Tyr 641; lessis known about serine or threonine. We demonstrate in primary human T-cells (> 95%CD3+) that IL4 and for the first time IL13 induce Stat6 serine but not threoninephosphorylation that closely paralleled early IL4 receptor α-chain activation (10 min). Stat6uniquely fails to share a positionally conserved Stat serine phosphorylation sequence;however; known phosphoacceptor sites are proline-flanked.

Progression of T cells through G 1-S phase of cell cycle requires Tcell receptor (TCR)-and/or cytokine-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5a/b. Stat5a/bmay also; in a cell-dependent manner; be constitutively or cytokine-induciblyphosphorylated on a Pro-Ser-Pro (PSP) motif located within the transcriptional activationdomain. Phosphorylation of the PSP motif is needed for maximal transcriptional activation byStat5; at least in certain promoter contexts. The basal and cytokine-inducible serinephosphorylation state of Stat5a/b has not been determined in T cells. Using primary humanT cells and T lymphocytic cell lines coupled with novel phospho-specific antibodies to thisconserved phosphoserine motif in Stat5a or Stat5b; we report that: Stat5a and Stat5b …,Journal of leukocyte biology,2002,49

Texture development and deformation mechanisms in ringwoodite,H-R Wenk; G Ischia; N Nishiyama; Y Wang; T Uchida,Abstract Ringwoodite Mg 2 SiO 4 with spinel structure is an important phase in the earth'smantle transition zone. Controlled deformation experiments showed that ringwooditeunderwent ductile deformation when compressed axially at 6–10 GPa and at roomtemperature in a multianvil D-DIA deformation apparatus. Texture evolution during cycliccompression has been recorded in situ using X-ray transparent anvils with monochromaticsynchrotron X-ray diffraction and a two-dimensional detector. Quantitative analysis of theimages with the Rietveld method revealed a 1 1 0 fiber texture. By comparing this texturepattern with polycrystal plasticity simulations; it is inferred that {1 1 1}< 1¯ 1 0> slip is thedominant deformation mechanism in ringwoodite; consistent with high temperaturemechanisms observed in other spinel-structured materials.

Transmission electron holography of silicon nanospheres with surface oxide layers,YC Wang; TM Chou; M Libera; TF Kelly,Phase images of 20–30-nm-diam silicon spheres were collected by holographic methods ina field-emission transmission electron microscope. The spherical geometry enables theeffect of specimen thickness on the electron-wave phase to be separated from the intrinsic Sielectron-optical refractive effects allowing a determination of the mean inner potential Φ 0.This work finds Φ 0= 11.9±0.9 V characterizing amorphous Si and 12.1±1.3 V characterizingcrystalline Si. The phase images can resolve a 2-nm-thick native oxide layer and give Φ 0for SiO 2= 10.1±0.6 V. The phase data can quickly recognize a surface layer; and the effectof a surface layer on the determination of the bulk mean potential can be minimized.,Applied physics letters,1997,40

Joining of zirconia to zirconia using Ag Cu Ti filler metal,HQ Hao; YL Wang; ZH Jin; XT Wang,Abstract The active brazing of partially stabilized ZrO 2 to ZrO 2 was carried out usingAg57Cu38Ti5 filler metal in a vacuum of 7× 10− 3 Pa. The effects of joining conditions suchas temperature (from 1073 to 1323 K) and holding time (from 0 to 60 min) on the jointstrength and the interfacial reaction were investigated. The joint strength was evaluated byshear testing. It was shown that the brazing temperature and holding time had a stronginfluence on the joint strength; which latter was controlled mainly by the interfacialmorphologies. A lower or higher temperature and a shorter or a longer holding time weredisadvantageous to joint strength due to the thinner reaction layer or cracks present at theinterface; the maximum joint strength being acheived at 1123 K for 30 min when theinterface reaction layer thickness was about 4.4 μm.

Ubiquitin ligase components Cullin4 and DDB1 are essential for DNA methylation in Neurospora crassa,Yuanbiao Zhao; Ye Shen; Silu Yang; Jiyong Wang; Qiwen Hu; Ying Wang; Qun He,Abstract DNA methylation and H3K9 trimethylation are involved in gene silencing andheterochromatin assembly in mammals and fungi. In the filamentous fungus Neurosporacrassa; it has been demonstrated that H3K9 trimethylation catalyzed by histonemethyltransferase DIM-5 is essential for DNA methylation. Trimethylated H3K9 is recognizedby HP1; which then recruits the DNA methyltransferase DIM-2 to methylate the DNA. Here;we show that in Neurospora; ubiquitin ligase components Cullin4 and DDB1 are essentialfor DNA methylation. These proteins regulate DNA methylation through their effects on thetrimethylation of histone H3K9. In addition; we showed that the E3 ligase activity of the Cul4-based ubiquitin ligase is required for its function in histone H3K9 trimethylation inNeurospora. Furthermore; we demonstrated that Cul4 and DDB1 are associated with the …,Journal of Biological Chemistry,2010,37

Toward accurate prediction of pKa values for internal protein residues: the importance of conformational relaxation and desolvation energy,Jason A Wallace; Yuhang Wang; Chuanyin Shi; Kevin J Pastoor; Bao‐Linh Nguyen; Kai Xia; Jana K Shen,Abstract Proton uptake or release controls many important biological processes; such asenergy transduction; virus replication; and catalysis. Accurate pK a prediction informs aboutproton pathways; thereby revealing detailed acid-base mechanisms. Physics-basedmethods in the framework of molecular dynamics simulations not only offer pK a predictionsbut also inform about the physical origins of pK a shifts and provide details of ionization-induced conformational relaxation and large-scale transitions. One such method is therecently developed continuous constant pH molecular dynamics (CPHMD) method; whichhas been shown to be an accurate and robust pK a prediction tool for naturally occurringtitratable residues. To further examine the accuracy and limitations of CPHMD; we blindlypredicted the pK a values for 87 titratable residues introduced in various hydrophobic …,Proteins: Structure; Function; and Bioinformatics,2011,34

DCAF26; an adaptor protein of Cul4-based E3; is essential for DNA methylation in Neurospora crassa,Hui Xu; Jiyong Wang; Qiwen Hu; Yun Quan; Huijie Chen; Yingqiong Cao; Chunbo Li; Ying Wang; Qun He,DNA methylation is involved in gene silencing and genome stability in organisms from fungito mammals. Genetic studies in Neurospora crassa previously showed that the CUL4-DDB1E3 ubiquitin ligase regulates DNA methylation via histone H3K9 trimethylation. However; thesubstrate-specific adaptors of this ligase that are involved in the process were not known.Here; we show that; among the 16 DDB1-and Cul4-associated factors (DCAFs) encoded inthe N. crassa genome; three interacted strongly with CUL4-DDB1 complexes. DNAmethylation analyses of dcaf knockout mutants revealed that dcaf26 was required for all ofthe DNA methylation that we observed. In addition; histone H3K9 trimethylation was alsoeliminated in dcaf26KO mutants. Based on the finding that DCAF26 associates with DDB1and the histone methyltransferase DIM-5; we propose that DCAF26 protein is the major …,PLoS genetics,2010,33

Chromosome boundary elements and regulation of heterochromatin spreading,Jiyong Wang; Stephanie T Lawry; Allison L Cohen; Songtao Jia,Abstract Chromatin is generally classified as euchromatin or heterochromatin; each withdistinct histone modifications; compaction levels; and gene expression patterns. Althoughthe proper formation of heterochromatin is essential for maintaining genome integrity andregulating gene expression; heterochromatin can also spread into neighboring regions in asequence-independent manner; leading to the inactivation of genes. Because the distanceof heterochromatin spreading is stochastic; the formation of boundaries; which block thespreading of heterochromatin; is critical for maintaining stable gene expression patterns.Here we review the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying heterochromatinspreading and boundary formation.,*,2014,31
Epe1 recruits BET family bromodomain protein Bdf2 to establish heterochromatin boundaries,Jiyong Wang; Xavier Tadeo; Haitong Hou; Patricia G Tu; James Thompson; John R Yates; Songtao Jia,Abstract Heterochromatin spreading leads to the silencing of genes within its path; andboundary elements have evolved to constrain such spreading. In fission yeast;heterochromatin at centromeres I and III is flanked by inverted repeats termed IRCs; whichare required for proper boundary functions. However; the mechanisms by which IRCsprevent heterochromatin spreading are unknown. Here; we identified Bdf2; which ishomologous to the mammalian bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family doublebromodomain proteins involved in diverse types of cancers; as a factor required for properboundary function at IRCs. Bdf2 is enriched at IRCs through its interaction with the boundaryprotein Epe1. The bromodomains of Bdf2 recognize acetylated histone H4 tails andantagonize Sir2-mediated deacetylation of histone H4K16. Furthermore; abolishing …,Genes & development,2013,31

Measurement of polystyrene mean inner potential by transmission electron holography of latex spheres,YC Wang; TM Chou; M Libera; E Voelkl; BG Frost,Abstract This study describes the use of transmission electron holography to determine themean inner potential of polystyrene. Spherical nanoparticles of amorphous polystyrene arestudied so that the effect of specimen thickness on the phase shift of an incident electronwave can be separated from the intrinsic refractive properties of the specimen. A recursivefour-parameter χ-squared minimization routine is developed to determine the sphere center;radius; and mean inner potential (Φ 0) at each pixel in the phase image. Because of thelarge number of pixels involved; the statistics associated with determining a single Φ0 valuecharacteristic of a given sphere are quite good. Simulated holograms show that theholographic reconstruction procedure and the χ-squared analysis method are robust.Averaging the Φ 0 data derived from ten phase images from ten different polystyrene …,Microscopy and Microanalysis,1998,28

The G1 phase arrest and apoptosis by intrinsic pathway induced by valproic acid inhibit proliferation of BGC-823 gastric carcinoma cells,Xia Zhao; Weihua Yang; Changwen Shi; Wanshan Ma; Jianing Liu; Yunshan Wang; Guosheng Jiang,Abstract Recent studies have demonstrated that the histone deacetylation level was closelyrelated to the genesis and development of tumors. Thus; activating histoneacetyltransferases and/or suppressing histone deacetylases (HDACs) can become anapproach for tumor chemotherapy. The histone acetylation regulation often results in theinhibition of cell proliferation; induction of cell apoptosis or differentiation; and cell cyclearrest in G1 phase. It has been demonstrated recently that the traditional anticonvulsantvalproic acid was an efficient class I HDAC inhibitor (HDACI); however; its antitumor effectand mechanisms on gastric cancers so far has not been elucidated clearly. In the presentstudy; gastric carcinoma cell lines BGC-823; HGC-27; and SGC-7901 were cultured withvalproic acid (VPA) in vitro.

Rapid epigenetic adaptation to uncontrolled heterochromatin spreading,Jiyong Wang; Bharat D Reddy; Songtao Jia,Abstract Heterochromatin; a highly compact chromatin state characterized by histone H3K9methylation and HP1 protein binding; silences the underlying DNA and influences theexpression of neighboring genes. However; the mechanisms that regulate heterochromatinspreading are not well understood. In this study; we show that the conserved Mst2 histoneacetyltransferase complex in fission yeast regulates histone turnover at heterochromatinregions to control heterochromatin spreading and prevents ectopic heterochromatinassembly. The combined loss of Mst2 and the JmjC domain protein Epe1 results inuncontrolled heterochromatin spreading and massive ectopic heterochromatin; leading tosevere growth defects due to the inactivation of essential genes. Interestingly; these cellsquickly recover by accumulating heterochromatin at genes essential for heterochromatin …,Elife,2015,25

The mechanism of hemifacial spasm: a new understanding of the offending artery,Ning-Ning Dou; Jun Zhong; Qiu-Meng Zhou; Jin Zhu; Yong-Nan Wang; Lei Xia; Xiao-Sheng Yang; Ting-Ting Ying; Xue-Sheng Zheng; Shi-Ting Li,Abstract Although neurovascular confliction was believed to be the cause of hemifacialspasm (HFS); the mechanism of the disorder remains unclear to date. Current theories;merely focusing on the facial nerve; have failed to explain the clinical phenomenon ofimmediate relief following a successful microvascular decompression surgery (MVD). Withthe experience of thousands of microvascular decompression surgeries and preliminaryinvestigations; we have learned that the offending artery may play a more important rolethan the effect of merely mechanical compression in the pathogenesis of the disease. Webelieve that the attrition of neurovascular interface is the essence of the etiology; and thesubstance of the disease is emersion of ectopic action potentials from the demyelinatedfacial nerve fibers; which were triggered by the sympathetic endings from the offending …,Neurological research,2015,23

An efficient algorithm coupled with synthetic minority over-sampling technique to classify imbalanced PubChem BioAssay data,Ming Hao; Yanli Wang; Stephen H Bryant,Abstract It is common that imbalanced datasets are often generated from high-throughputscreening (HTS). For a given dataset without taking into account the imbalanced nature;most classification methods tend to produce high predictive accuracy for the majority class;but significantly poor performance for the minority class. In this work; an efficient algorithm;GLMBoost; coupled with Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE) isdeveloped and utilized to overcome the problem for several imbalanced datasets fromPubChem BioAssay. By applying the proposed combinatorial method; those data of raresamples (active compounds); for which usually poor results are generated; can be detectedapparently with high balanced accuracy (Gmean). As a comparison with GLMBoost;Random Forest (RF) combined with SMOTE is also adopted to classify the same datasets …,Analytica chimica acta,2014,21

Study of allicin microcapsules in β-cyclodextrin and porous starch mixture,Yu-Feng Wang; Jiang-Juan Shao; Zhao-Long Wang; Zhao-Xin Lu,Abstract Allicin has several biological properties; however; its low stability and water-solubility limit its use as food preservatives. New allicin microcapsules can be efficientlyprepared via a spray drying technology using β-cyclodextrin with porous starch as a wallmaterial. This process improves their properties; thus increasing their solubility; allowingthem to be directly dissolved in water. Furthermore; the stability of allicin microcapsulesagainst heat; pH; light and oxygen also improved; with the amounts of allicin improving byabout 20% to 40%. Thus; allicin microcapsules retained the desired antimicrobial activityafter encapsulation with high temperatures; with retention rates ranging from 85.5%±1.53%to 92.2%±1.70%. In addition; microcapsules still exhibited a broad-spectrum inhibitoryactivity against food borne pathogens; such as Staphylococcus aureus; Bacillus subtilis …,Food research international,2012,21

Food preservation effects of curcumin microcapsules,Yu-Feng Wang; Jiang-Juan Shao; Chun-Hong Zhou; Dong-Liang Zhang; Xiao-Mei Bie; Feng-Xia Lv; Chong Zhang; Zhao-Xin Lu,Abstract Curcumin has numerous biological activities but its low stability and water-solubilitylimit its applications. Microencapsulation of curcumin can improve both of these properties.In this work; food preservation effects of curcumin microcapsules in practical applications forfoods such as tofu; bread and cooked pork were studied. The results show that curcuminmicrocapsules had preservation effects on food when its concentration was above 0.035%;even if it was boiled. Compared with free curcumin; microcapsules not only had bettersolubility and high heat resistance but also reduced mold spores by (34.4±2.5) to(52.3±4.1)%. Curcumin microcapsules therefore offer a superior choice for preserving food;especially during thermal processing.,Food Control,2012,20

Pharmacophore and 3D-QSAR characterization of 6-arylquinazolin-4-amines as Cdc2-like kinase 4 (Clk4) and dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated ki...,Yongmei Pan; Yanli Wang; Stephen H Bryant,Cdc2-like kinase 4 (Clk4) and dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A(Dyrk1A) are protein kinases that are promising targets for treatment of diseases caused byabnormal gene splicing. 6-Arylquinazolin-4-amines have been recently identified as potentClk4 and Dyrk1A inhibitors. In order to understand the structure–activity correlation of theseanalogs; we have applied ligand-based pharmacophore and 3D-QSAR modeling combinedwith structure-based homology modeling and docking. The high R 2 and Q 2 (0.88 and 0.79for Clk4; 0.85 and 0.82 for Dyrk1A; respectively) based on validation with training and testset compounds suggested that the generated 3D-QSAR models are reliable in predictingnovel ligand activities against Clk4 and Dyrk1A.

Theantithrombotic activities of UEP isolated from the lichen were examined in vitro and in vivofor the first time. The in vitro anticoagulant activity of UEP was tested by its PT; APTT and TT.The more prolongation of APTT suggested a more obvious inhibition of the intrinsiccoagulation systems than the extrinsic. Its antithrombotic properties were evaluated using anarteriovenous shunt thrombosis model in rats; and its inhibition of thrombus formationincreased in a dose-dependent manner. It also caused a dose-dependent increase in tailtransection bleeding time. Oral administration of UEP also showed a significant dosedependent preventive effect against thrombotic death or paralysis.

Elimination of shelterin components bypasses RNAi for pericentric heterochromatin assembly,Xavier Tadeo; Jiyong Wang; Scott P Kallgren; Jinqiang Liu; Bharat D Reddy; Feng Qiao; Songtao Jia,Abstract The RNAi pathway is required for heterochromatin assembly at repetitive DNAelements in diverse organisms. In fission yeast; loss of RNAi causes pericentricheterochromatin defects; compromising gene silencing and chromosome segregation. Herewe show that deletion of telomere shelterin components restores pericentricheterochromatin and its functions in RNAi mutants. We further isolated a separation-of-function mutant of Poz1 and revealed that defective telomere silencing; but not telomerelength control; is critical for bypassing RNAi. Further analyses demonstrated thatcompromising shelterin-mediated heterochromatin assembly in RNAi mutants releasesheterochromatin protein Swi6; which is redistributed to pericentric regions through RNAi-independent heterochromatin assembly pathways. Given the high mobility of Swi6 protein …,Genes & development,2013,18

One Bit Support Recovery,Hui Wang; Qun Wan,The theory of Compressed Sensing (CS) enables reconstruction of sparse or compressiblesignals from a small number of linear measurements; relative to the dimension of the signalspace. Rather than the uniformly sampling; the compressive sensing computes innerproducts with a randomized dictionary of test functions. The signal is then recovered by aconvex optimization. One of the main challenges in CS is to find the support of a sparsesignal from a set of observations. In this paper we consider the case of 1-bit measurements;which preserve only the sign information of the random measurements. Although it ispossible to recover using the classical compressive sensing approach or fixed pointcontinuation (FPC) algorithm by treating the 1-bit measurements as±1 measurement values;in this paper we reformulate the problem to a convex problem and use a search algorithm …,Wireless Communications Networking and Mobile Computing (WiCOM); 2010 6th International Conference on,2010,16

Subcooled flow boiling in a microchannel with a pin fin and a liquid jet in crossflow,Yingying Wang; Yoav Peles,Abstract This experimental study presents subcooled flow boiling of an engineering fluid—HFE-7000—downstream a single pin fin in a microchannel. A liquid secondary jet wasintroduced into the flow to examine its merits pertinent to heat transfer enhancement. It wasfound that for HFE-7000 high wall superheats (Δ T (sat; ONB)∼ 40° C) were required for theonset of nucleate boiling (ONB). Once boiling started; nucleate boiling dominated. Heattransfer coefficient increased monotonically with heat flux; independent of mass flux and jetinjections. Secondary flow injection; which was previously found to be an affective singlephase heat transfer enhancement technique; showed limited potential for fully developednucleate boiling.,International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer,2015,15

In situ latticerecovery occurred and SiC remained single crystalline during implantation. Notablestructural damage resulted in the implanted region. The residual damage significantlyaccelerated the oxidation rate of SiC at 1373 K but caused no appreciable rate increase at1573 K. The diminishing of the effect of the damages on oxidation can be attributed toenhanced damage annealing with temperature.,Applied physics letters,1993,14
The proper connection between shelterin components is required for telomeric heterochromatin assembly,Jiyong Wang; Allison L Cohen; Anudari Letian; Xavier Tadeo; James J Moresco; Jinqiang Liu; John R Yates; Feng Qiao; Songtao Jia,Abstract Telomeric regions contain prominent sites of heterochromatin; which is associatedwith unique histone modification profiles such as the methylation of histone H3 at Lys9(H3K9me). In fission yeast; the conserved telomeric shelterin complex recruits the histoneH3K9 methyltransferase complex CLRC to establish subtelomeric heterochromatin.Although many shelterin mutations affect subtelomeric heterochromatin assembly; themechanism remains elusive due to the diverse functions of shelterin. Through affinitypurification; we found that shelterin directly associates with CLRC through the Ccq1 subunit.Surprisingly; mutations that disrupt interactions between shelterin subunits compromisesubtelomeric heterochromatin without affecting CLRC interaction with shelterin componentPot1; located at chromosome ends. We further discovered that telomeric repeats are …,Genes & development,2016,13

PMA and ionomycin induce glioblastoma cell death: activation-induced cell-death-like phenomena occur in glioma cells,Sheng Han; Xinxin Tie; Lingxuan Meng; Yunjie Wang; Anhua Wu,Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin (Io) can induce T cell activation andproliferation. Furthermore; they stimulate activation-induced cell death (AICD) in maturelymphocytes via Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) up-regulation. In this study; we explored the influenceof PMA/Io treatment on glioblastoma cells; and found that AICD-like phenomena may alsooccur in glioma. Using the MTT assay and cell counting; we demonstrated that treatment ofPMA/Io significantly inhibited the proliferation of glioma cell lines; U87 and U251. TUNELassays and transmission electron microscopy revealed that PMA/Io markedly induced U87and U251 cell apoptosis. Propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry showed thattreatment with PMA/Io resulted in an arrestment of cell cycle and an increase in cell death.Using real-time PCR and western blot; we found that PMA/Io up-regulated the expression …,PloS one,2013,13

Energy-balanced cooperative routing in multihop wireless ad hoc networks,Siyuan Chen; Minsu Huang; Yang Li; Ying Zhu; Yu Wang,Cooperative communication (CC) allows multiple nodes to simultaneously transmit the samepacket to the receiver so that the combined signal at the receiver can be correctly decoded.Since the cooperative communication can reduce the transmission power and extend thetransmission coverage; it has been considered in minimum energy routing protocols toreduce the total energy consumption. However; previous research on cooperative routingonly focuses on minimizing the total energy consumption from the source node to thedestination node; which may lead to the unbalanced energy distribution among nodes. Inthis paper; we aim to study the impact of cooperative routing on balancing the energydistribution among nodes. By introducing a new routing scheme which carefully selectscooperative relay nodes and assigns their transmission power; our cooperative routing …,Communications (ICC); 2012 IEEE International Conference on,2012,12

Temozolomide decreases invasion of glioma stem cells by down-regulating TGF-β2,Dongyong Zhang; Zhitao Jing; Bo Qiu; Anhua Wu; Yunjie Wang,Abstract Gliomas are characterized by excessive proliferation; diffuse infiltration andimmunosuppression. Recent studies implicate a key role for a restricted population of gliomastem cells (GSCs) in glioma invasive growth and recurrence. Transforming growth factor(TGF)-β2 is a mediator of immunosuppression associated with malignant glioma and alsoinfluences pro-invasive functions. Temozolomide (TMZ); is a new alkylating agent withpromising antitumour efficacy for malignant gliomas; and the effect of TMZ on GSCs invasionhas not been known. To address this issue; we developed studies aimed at neurospheresfrom primary cultured glioma cells; due to the fact that since neurospheres can be enrichedin GSCs; we could examine whether TMZ inhibits the invasion of GSCs. TMZ reduced theTGF-β2-mediated invasion; and down-regulated TGF-β2 expression at the mRNA and …,Oncology reports,2011,11

Approach to integrate fuzzy fault tree with Bayesian network,Yanfu Wang; Min Xie,Abstract Fuzzy fault tree (FFT) can offer an efficient method of representing the fault causesand handling fuzzy information in the relationships among events. However; FFT cannotincorporate the evidence into the reasoning as Bayesian Network (BN). To overcome thedisadvantage of FFT and BN; an approach of integrating FFT with BN is proposed in thispaper. Firstly; the FFT technique of Takagi and Sugeno model that can handle uncertaintiesin the relationships among different events is introduced. Secondly; the translation rules ofconverting FFT into BN are presented. The integration algorithm is then demonstrated on anoffshore fire case study.,Procedia engineering,2012,10

Responses of two nonlinear microbial models to warming and increased carbon input,YP Wang; J Jiang; Benito Chen-Charpentier; Fola B Agusto; Alan Hastings; F Hoffman; Martin Rasmussen; Matthew J Smith; K Todd-Brown; Y Wang; X Xu; YQ Luo,Abstract A number of nonlinear microbial models of soil carbon decomposition have beendeveloped. Some of them have been applied globally but have yet to be shown torealistically represent soil carbon dynamics in the field. A thorough analysis of their keydifferences is needed to inform future model developments. Here we compare two nonlinearmicrobial models of soil carbon decomposition: one based on reverse Michaelis–Mentenkinetics (model A) and the other on regular Michaelis–Menten kinetics (model B). Usinganalytic approximations and numerical solutions; we find that the oscillatory responses ofcarbon pools to a small perturbation in their initial pool sizes dampen faster in model A thanin model B. Soil warming always decreases carbon storage in model A; but in model B itpredominantly decreases carbon storage in cool regions and increases carbon storage in …,Biogeosciences,2016,7

Enhancement of antiproliferative activity by phototautomerization of anthrylphenols,Marijeta Kralj; Lidija Uzelac; Yu-Hsuan Wang; Peter Wan; Martina Tireli; Kata Mlinarić-Majerski; Ivo Piantanida; Nikola Basarić,An antiproliferative investigation was conducted on 3 human cancer cell lines; HCT 116(colon); MCF-7 (breast); and H 460 (lung); on a series of 4 anthrylphenols in the dark andupon exposure to light (350 nm). 9-(2-Hydroxyphenyl) anthracene (1) moderately inhibitedproliferation; but irradiation considerably enhanced the effect. The other anthracenes 4–6exhibited antiproliferative activity in the dark; which was not enhanced upon irradiation. Theenhancement of the antiproliferative effect on the irradiation of 1 was rationalized as beingdue to the formation of quinone methide (QM 2) by excited state proton transfer. QM 2 actsas an electrophilic species capable of reacting with biological molecules. Although QM 2reacts with nucleotides; the adducts could not be isolated. On the contrary; cysteine adduct 8was isolated and characterized; whereas the adducts with glycine; serine and tripeptide …,Photochemical & Photobiological Sciences,2015,6

Tls1 regulates splicing of shelterin components to control telomeric heterochromatin assembly and telomere length,Jiyong Wang; Xavier Tadeo; Haitong Hou; Stuart Andrews; James J Moresco; John R Yates III; Peter L Nagy; Songtao Jia,Abstract Heterochromatin preferentially forms at repetitive DNA elements through RNAi-mediated targeting of histone-modifying enzymes. It was proposed that splicing factorsinteract with the RNAi machinery or regulate the splicing of repeat transcripts to directlyparticipate in heterochromatin assembly. Here; by screening the fission yeast deletionlibrary; we comprehensively identified factors required for telomeric heterochromatinassembly; including a novel gene tls1+. Purification of Tls1 and mass spectrometry analysisof its interacting proteins show that Tls1 associates with the spliceosome subunit Brr2. RNAsequencing analysis shows that the splicing of a subset of mRNAs are affected in tls1Δ cells;including mRNAs of shelterin components rap1+ and poz1+. Importantly; replacing rap1+and poz1+ with their cDNAs significantly alleviated heterochromatin defects of tls1Δ cells …,Nucleic acids research,2014,6

In this study; we study therelationship between texture semantics and textile images; and propose a novel parametricmapping model to predict texture semantics from textile images. To represent rich texturesemantics and enable it to participate in computation; 2D continuous semantic space; wherethe axes correspond to hard-soft and warm-cool; is first adopted to quantitatively describetexture semantics. Then texture features of textile images are extracted using Gabordecomposition. Finally; the mapping model between texture features and texture semanticsin the semantic space is built using three different methods: linear regression; k-nearestneighbor (KNN) and Multi-layered Perceptron (MLP).

It is shown that the electromigration reliability lifetime depends strongly on themetal stack and the metallization process used. Three fill processes that employ PVD Ti andPVD Ti/TiN liners result in poor electromigration; while a process using CVD TiN leads tosuperior electromigration performance. In this particular case the current density had to beincreased to values as high as 2.5 MA/cm2 in order to induce a statistically relevant numberof fails in certain structures. Two of the most important parameters that determine theelectromigration lifetime in damascene lines are (1) the quality of the Al sidewalls asdetermined for instance by the presence of a TiAl 3 reaction layer and (2) the amount of …,AIP Conference Proceedings,1999,4

A phase-only frequency receiver scheme based on compressive sensingtechnique is presented first. Then; we propose two reconstruction algorithms: one is convex;and the other is hybrid; which is based on robust optimisation and iterative hard threshold.With these methods; multiple frequencies estimation is accomplished by reconstructing theFourier transform of the complex-valued time signal and finding peaks in the frequencydomain. Simulation experiments illustrate its advantages both with noiseless and additivewhite Gaussian noise (AWGN) cases.

BRITTLE-TO-DUCTILE TRANSITION TEMPERATURE AND ITS STRAIN RAf E SENSITIVITY IN Ti-47Al-2Mn-2Nb-0.8 TiB_2,WANG Yu; LIN Dongliang; TL Lin; LIU Junliang; CC Law,Abstract The effect of strain rate on the tensile yield strength and elongation of titaniumaluminide has been studied. The alloy has a composition of Ti-47Al-2Mn-2Nb-0.8 TiB2(atomic fraction;%; volume fraction;%; only for TiB2) and near lamellar dricrostructure. Itmanifests brittle-to-ductile transition (BDT) at elevated temperature and its brittle-to-ductiletransition temperature (TBDT) is positively sensitive to the strain rate. The addition of boronlowers the TBDT considerably; and the corresponding activation energy of BDT decreasesto 256 kJ/mol; which is less than that of the alloy without boron (TiB2); but approximates theself-diffusion activation energy of atoms in the TiAl alloy. From additional fractographyanalysis and theoretical estimation; it is suggested that the BDT course of 7 titaniumaluminide with the addition of boron (TiB2) is controlled by dislocation climbing.,Acta Metall Sin,1998,2
A Pilot Study',Yue Wang; Allard Jongman; Joan A Sereno,1.1 Background It is believed that; as compared to infants; adults depend more on linguisticexperience than on auditory mechanisms in the perception of speech sounds. That is; theyidentify and discriminate speech sounds with reference to the linguistic categories of theirnative language. They are inferior to infants or children in the ability to distinguish novelforeign sounds. However; recent research suggests that adult perceptual mechanisms havemore plasticity than was previously recognized. Therefore; a number of researchers haveattempted to train listeners to perceive nonnative sounds in a linguistically meaningfulmanner; based on the assumption that the perceptual system of mature adults can be,Working Papers of the Cornell Phonetics Laboratory,1998,2

FDTD simulation of real lumped components and RF devices,Yong Wang; Scott Langdon,A time domain full wave approach for simulating real lumped components and RF devices ispresented. To simulate these real circuits characterized by measured parameters; thepassivity enforcement method is first introduced to the time domain electromagneticsimulation method. This method guarantees the causality and passivity of the extractedrational model. A few methods can then be applied to transform the rational model of Y-parameters matrix into the time domain and incorporate into FDTD update equations. From anumber of numerical experiments; it is found that the piecewise linear recursive convolution(PLRC) method appears to be a little more robust and accurate than other approaches.

Image Intensity Analysis for Defect Localization Utilizing SEM BSE Imaging,J Demarest; K Chanda; S Klepeis; B Redder; A Shore; Y Wang; C Christiansen; C Rue,Abstract Failure analysts occasionally find themselves faced with the problem of having oneof the various defect isolation techniques indicating a defect location; and yet no defect isreadily visible through the various imaging methods available. Many common conventionalimaging tools; such as scanning electron microscopes (SEM); display images in shades ofgray. The human eye is inherently more sensitive to changes in color rather than changes ingrayscale. As a result; subtle variations in grayscale which could indicate the defect locationcan go unobserved unless a careful examination of the image intensities is performed. Oneuseful way to highlight these variations is through intensity profiling where a line scan isdrawn through the region under investigation and compared to an identical referencelocation contained within the same image. Subtle variations in the intensity profiles can …,INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM FOR TESTING AND FAILURE ANALYSIS,2006,1

The Impact of Jump Dynamics on Density Prediction,Yaw-Huei Wang,Abstract This study investigates whether incorporating jumps with stochastic volatility canimprove the power of density prediction for the FTSE 100 index. A general double-jumpmodel proposed by Duffie; Pan; and Singleton (2000) is used to fit market price of optionsand estimate risk-neural densities. Both risk-neutral and real-world densities are evaluatedwith two different tests for five forecast horizons. Our empirical results indicate that addingjumps in the price or/and volatility processes not only substantially lowers the fitting errors ofoption prices; but also improves the prediction power of risk-neutral densities although theimprovement may not always be significant enough. Moreover; real-world densities alwaysprovide satisfactory density prediction; which does not depend on the addition of jumps andthe approaches used to construct the densities.,*,2006,1

Formal description of a generic graph model with RTPA,Aderemi Adewumi; Yingxu Wang,Formal specification of abstract data types (ADTs) is important in modeling systemarchitectures and their implementations. One of the most widely used ADTs is graph; sincemany problems in sciences and engineering can be formulated and solved by a graphmodel. In this paper; we present a formal approach to the specification of graphs as an ADTusing real-time process algebra (RTPA). RTPA is a formal method that describes a softwaresystem; especially a real-time system; as a set of processes. We use RTPA to describe ageneric graph model in three parts encompassing the architecture; static and dynamicbehaviors. In the RTPA specification; the graph behaviors can be classified into fourcategories; namely:(a) basic operations (InsertNode; DeleteNode; InsertEdge; DeleteEdge;GetSize; GetNumberOfEdges; Retrieve; Update; and Search);(b) node/edge-specific …,Electrical and Computer Engineering; 2004.

Control of intonation in HMM based text-to-speech systems,Yongxin WANG; Jia JIA; Yuchen ZHANG; Lianhong CAI,Intonation is an important research topic in speech analysis and synthesis; with acomputable intonation model as the key to achieving intonation control in synthesizedspeech. This study analyzes the pitch movement of syllables in a sentence to describe theintonation patterns in Chinese sentences. Declarative sentences have downward pitcheswhile interrogative sentences raise the pitches and have more elaborate pitch contours. Aunified intonation representation is then given with an intonation pattern difference model forinterrogative and declarative sentences. The model is used to control sentence intonation ina hidden Markov model (HMM) for speech synthesis. Tests show that this unified intonationrepresentation can produce the different declarative intonations and the intonation patterndifference between interrogative and declarative intonation.

Combining Active and Semi-supervised Learning for Homograph Disambiguation in Mandarin Text-to-Speech Synthesis,Binbin Shen; Zhiyong Wu; Yongxin Wang; Lianhong Cai,Abstract Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P) is a crucial step for Mandarin text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis; where homograph disambiguation is the core issue. Severalmachine learning algorithms have been proposed to solve the issue by building modelsfrom well annotated training corpus. However; the preparation of such well annotated corpusis very laboring and time-consuming which requires lots of manual hand-label work tovalidate the proper pronunciations of the homographs. This work tries to cover this problemby introducing the active learning (AL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms forthe homograph disambiguation task using unlabeled data. Experiments show that theproposed framework can greatly reduce the cost of manual hand-label work whilepreserving the performance of the trained model.,Twelfth Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association,2011,*

Consolidation Coefficient Inversion and Prediction of Seawall Foundation Settlement Based on Fractal Theory,Peng Qin; Zhihai Qin; Yinghua Wang; Rijun Zhang,Prediction of the seawall foundation settlement is important to the engineering maintenanceand disaster prevention. A new method based on the fractal theory was presented on theexample of the seawall located in Zhejiang Province of China. The soil consolidationcoefficient was inversed by using the layer-wise summation method and Terzaghiconsolidation theory; and then the seawall foundation settlement was predicted by applyingthe improved variable-dimension fractal model. The results can reflect the actual mechanismof soil consolidation settlement; and the proposed method has a degree of applicability.,Information Engineering and Computer Science; 2009. ICIECS 2009.

Bounds and Prices of Currency Cross-Rate Options,Chung San-Lin; Yaw-Huei Wang,Abstract This paper derives the pricing bounds of a currency cross-rate option using theoption prices of two related dollar rates via a copula theory and presents the analyticalproperties of the bounds under the Gaussian framework. Our option pricing bounds areuseful; because (1) they are general in the sense that they do not rely on the distributionassumptions of the state vari-ables or on the selection of the copula function;(2) they areportfolios of the dollar-rate op-tions and hence are potential hedging instruments for cross-rate options; and (3) they can be applied to generate bounds on deltas. The empirical testssuggest that there are persistent and stable relationships between the market prices and theestimated bounds of the cross-rate op-tions and that our option pricing bounds (obtainedfrom the market prices of options on two dollar rates) and the historical correlation of two …,*,2007,*

The Performance of GARCH Models with Short-memory; Long-memory; or Jump Dynamics: Evidence from Global Financial Markets,Yaw-Huei Wang; Chih-Chiang Hsu,ABSTRACT This study evaluates the performance of alternative volatility models; includingEGARCH; FIEGARCH; EGARCH-jump; and EGARCH-skewed-t models; on model fitting;volatility forecasting; and Value-at-Risk (VaR) prediction. As compared with the simpleEGARCH model; the EGARCH-jump model demonstrates significant improvements;outperforming every other model in almost all aspects; but the computation loadsubstantially increases by the inclusion of jump dynamics. If less expensive volatility modelsare preferred; then alternatives may include the use of the EGARCH-skewed-t model formodel fitting and VaR prediction; and the FIEGARCH model for volatility forecasting; sincethese models also demonstrate fairly good performance for these specific purposes.Furthermore; since the FIEGARCH model demonstrates relatively good performance with …,*,2006,*

Data on χ″versus T show the expected intergranular coupling peak at the temperature T p. For aspecific dc field T p is found to increase with x varying from 0 to 0.10; and to decreasesharply at x> 0.10. Moreover; the transport critical current density J ct of samples increaseswith x up to 0.10.

Energy Efficient Topology for Unicast and Broadcast Routings,Wen-Zhan Song; Yu Wang; Xiang-Yang Li; Ophir Frieder,Abstract—We propose a novel topology control strategy for each wireless node to locallyselect communication neighbors and adjust transmission range; hence all nodes togetherself-form an energy efficient topology for unicast and broadcast routings in ad hocenvironment. We first propose an improved strategy to construct degree-bounded planarspanner called SΘGG; by using relative positions only. SΘGG keeps the same powerspanning ratio with SY aoGG [30]; while further reducing the node degree from k to k− 1when same parameter k is used. In addition; it is Θ-separated: the directions between anytwo neighbors of a node are separated by at least an angle θ. We then propose the firstlocalized algorithm to construct a planar spanner with bounded node degree and lowweight. The algorithm can apply to any known degree-bounded planar spanner …,*,*,*
