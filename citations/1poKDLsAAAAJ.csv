The description logic handbook: Theory; implementation and applications,Franz Baader,Description Logics are a family of knowledge representation languages that have beenstudied extensively in Artificial Intelligence over the last two decades. They are embodied inseveral knowledge-based systems and are used to develop various real-life applications.The Description Logic Handbook provides a thorough account of the subject; covering allaspects of research in this field; namely: theory; implementation; and applications. Its appealwill be broad; ranging from more theoretically-oriented readers; to those with morepractically-oriented interests who need a sound and modern understanding of knowledgerepresentation systems based on Description Logics. The chapters are written by some ofthe most prominent researchers in the field; introducing the basic technical material beforetaking the reader to the current state of the subject; and including comprehensive guides …,*,2003,10454
The complexity of concept languages,Francesco M Donini; Maurizio Lenzerini; Daniele Nardi; Werner Nutt,Abstract A basic feature of Terminological Knowledge Representation Systems is torepresent knowledge by means of taxonomies; here called terminologies; and to provide aspecialized reasoning engine to do inferences on these structures. The taxonomy is builtthrough a representation language called aconcept language (ordescription logic); which isgiven a well-defined set-theoretic semantics. The efficiency of reasoning has often beenadvocated as a primary motivation for the use of such systems. The main contributions of thepaper are:(1) a complexity analysis of concept satisfiability and subsumption for a wide classof concept languages;(2) algorithms for these inferences that comply with the worst-casecomplexity of the reasoning task they perform.,Information and Computation,1997,494
Subsumption algorithms for concept languages,Bernhard Hollunder; Werner Nutt; Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Künstliche Intelligenz,We investigate the subsumption problem in logic-based knowledge representationlanguages of the KL-ONE family and give decision procedures. All our languages contain asa kernel the logical connectives conjunction; disjunction; and negation for concepts; as wellas role quantification. The algorithms are rule-based and can be understood as variants oftableaux calculus with a special control strategy. In the first part of the paper; we add numberrestrictions and conjunction of roles to the kernel language. We show that subsumption inthis language is decidable; and we investigate sublanguages for which the problem ofdeciding subsumption is PSPACE-complete. In the second part; we amalgamate the kernellanguage with feature descriptions as used in computational linguistics. We show thatfeature descriptions do not increase the complexity of the subsumption problem.,*,1990,287
Order-sorted equational computation,Gert Smolka; Werner Nutt; Joseph A Goguen; José Meseguer,This chapter discusses order-sorted equational computation. Many-sorted equational logicis the basis for algebraic specifications; rewriting techniques; unification theory; andequational programming. In the standard approach; sorts are unrelated and can be thoughtof as denoting disjoint sets. Order-sorted equational logic improves the expressivity of many-sorted equational logic by adding the notion of subsorts. The standard example of anabstract data type; stacks of natural numbers; is specified in order-sorted equational logic. Itis known that defining a less or equal test for integers with unconditional equations not usingsubsorts is complicated; one has to introduce an auxiliary function and an auxiliary sort.These complications disappear if one uses conditional equations; but verification methodsfor the confluence of conditional rewriting systems are complicated and in most cases not …,*,1987,232

Collecting and providing information about the status ofthe Grid itself is called Grid monitoring. We describe R-GMA (Relational Grid MonitoringArchitecture) as a solution to the Grid monitoring problem. It uses a local as view approachto information integration and will be a component of the European Union's DataGrid. The R-GMA architecture and mechanisms are general and could be used in other areas wherethere is a need for publishing and querying information in a distributed fashion.,On The Move to Meaningful Internet Systems 2003: CoopIS; DOA; and ODBASE,2003,187
Rewriting aggregate queries using views,Sara Cohen; Werner Nutt; Alexander Serebrenik,We investigate the problem of rewriting queries with aggregate operators using views thatmay or may not contain aggregate operators. A rewriting of a query is a second query thatuses view predicates such that evaluating first the views and then the rewriting yields thesame result as evaluating the original query. In this sense; the original query and therewriting are equivalent modulo the view definitions. The queries and views we considercorrespond to unnested SQL queries; possibly with union; that employ the operators min;max; count; and sum.,Proceedings of the eighteenth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1999,181
Tractable concept languages,Francesco M Donini; Maurizio Lenzerini; Daniele Nardi; Werner Nutt,Abstract We present two concept languages;; called PL1 and PL2 which are extensions ofTC-. We prove that the subsumption problem in these languages can be solved inpolynomial time. Both languages include a construct for expressing inverse roles; which hasnot been considered up to now in tractable languages. In addition; PL1 includes numberrestrictions and negation of primitive concepts; while Pl2 includes role conjunction and rolechaining. By exploiting recent complexity results; we show that none of the constructsusually considered in concept languages can be added to PL1 and PL2 without losingtractabtlity. Therefore; on the assumption that Languages are characterized by the set ofconstructs they provide; the two languages presented in this paper provide a solution to theproblem of singling out an optimal trade-off between expressive power and computational …,Proc. of the 12th Int.

An epistemic operator for description logics,Francesco M Donini; Maurizio Lenzerini; Daniele Nardi; Werner Nutt; Andrea Schaerf,Abstract Description logics (also called terminological logics; or concept languages) arefragments of first-order logic that provide a formal account of the basic features of frame-based systems. However; there are aspects of frame-based systems—such asnonmonotonic reasoning and procedural rules—that cannot be characterized in a standardfirst-order framework. Such features are needed for real applications; and a clearunderstanding of the logic underlying them is necessary for principled implementations. Weshow how description logics enriched with an epistemic operator can formalize suchaspects. The logic obtained is a fragment of a first-order nonmonotonic modal logic.

Subsumption between queries to object-oriented databases,Martin Buchheit; Manfred A Jeusfeld; Werner Nutt; Martin Staudt,Abstract Most work on query optimization in relational and object-oriented databases hasconcentrated on tuning algebraic expressions and the physical access to the databasecontents. The attention to semantic query optimization; however; has been restricted due toits inherent complexity. We take a second look at semantic query optimization in object-oriented databases and find that reasoning techniques for concept languages developed inArtificial Intelligence apply to this problem because concept languages have been tailoredfor efficiency and their semantics is compatible with class and query definitions in object-oriented databases. We propose a query optimizer that recognizes subset relationshipsbetween a query and a view (a simpler query whose answer is stored) in polynomial time.The selected schema and query language is maximal in the sense that any added feature …,Information Systems,1994,150
The complexity of existential quantification in concept languages,Francesco M Donini; Maurizio Lenzerini; Daniele Nardi; Bernhard Hollunder; Werner Nutt; Alberto Marchetti Spaccamela,Abstract Much of the research on concept languages; which also are called terminologicallanguages; has focused on the computational complexity of subsumption. The intractabilityresults can be divided into two groups. First; it has been shown that extending the basiclanguage jy-with constructs containing some form of logical disjunction leads to co-NP-hardsubsumption problems. Secondly; adding negation to jy-makes subsumption PSPACE-complete. The main result of this paper is that extending jy-with unrestricted existentialquantification makes subsumption NP-complete. This is the first proof of intractability for aconcept language containing; whether explicitly or implicitly; no construct expressingdisjunction. Unrestricted existential quantification is therefore; alongside disjunction; asource of computational complexity in concept languages.,Artificial Intelligence,1992,146
Adding epistemic operators to concept languages,Francesco M Donini; Maurizio Lenzerini; Daniele Nardi; Werner Nutt; Andrea Schaerf,Abstract We investigate the use of epistemic operators in the framework of conceptlanguages (also called terminological languages). The results of this work have a twofoldsignificance. From the point of view of epistemic logics; our contribution is to have identifiedan effective procedure for the problem of answering epistemic queries posed to aknowledge base expressed in the concept language ACC. From the point of view of conceptlanguages; the most relevant aspect of our work is that we have reconstructed in logicseveral common features of existing knowledge representation systems. Epistemicoperators provide a highly expressive query language; allow for the treatment of severaldatabase features; such as closed world reasoning and integrity constraints; and finally cangive a formal characterization of some procedural mechanisms; such as trigger rules …,Proc. of the 3rd Int.

The relational grid monitoring architecture: Mediating information about the grid,Andrew W Cooke; A JG Gray; Werner Nutt; James Magowan; Manfred Oevers; Paul Taylor; Roney Cordenonsi; Rob Byrom; Linda Cornwall; Abdeslem Djaoui; Laurence Field; SM Fisher; Steve Hicks; Jason Leake; Robin Middleton; Antony Wilson; Xiaomei Zhu; Norbert Podhorszki; Brian Coghlan; Stuart Kenny; David O’Callaghan; John Ryan,Abstract We have developed and implemented the Relational Grid Monitoring Architecture(R-GMA) as part of the DataGrid project; to provide a flexible information and monitoringservice for use by other middleware components and applications. R-GMA presents userswith a virtual database and mediates queries posed at this database: users pose queriesagainst a global schema and R-GMA takes responsibility for locating relevant sources andreturning an answer. R-GMA's architecture and mechanisms are general and can be usedwherever there is a need for publishing and querying information in a distributedenvironment. We discuss the requirements; design and implementation of R-GMA asdeployed on the DataGrid testbed. We also describe some of the ways in which R-GMA isbeing used.,Journal of Grid Computing,2004,119
Basic narrowing revisited,Werner Nutt; Pierre Réty; Gert Smolka,In this paper we study basic narrowing as a method for solving equations in theinitialalgebra specified by a ground confluent and terminating term rewriting system. Since we areinterested in equation solving; we don't study basic narrowing as a reduction relation onterms but consider immediately its reformulation as an equation solving rule. Thisreformulation leads to a technically simpler presentation and reveals that the essence ofbasic narrowing can be captured without recourse to term unification. We present anequation solving calculus that features three classes of rules. Resolution rules; whoseapplication is don't know nondeterministic; are the basic rules and suffice for a completesolution procedure. Failure rules detect inconsistent parts of the search space.

Evolution of DL− Lite Knowledge Bases,Diego Calvanese; Evgeny Kharlamov; Werner Nutt; Dmitriy Zheleznyakov,Abstract We study the problem of evolution for Knowledge Bases (KBs) expressed inDescription Logics (DLs) of the DL− Lite family. DL− Lite is at the basis of OWL 2 QL; one ofthe tractable fragments of OWL 2; the recently proposed revision of the Web OntologyLanguage. We propose some fundamental principles that KB evolution should respect. Wereview known model and formula-based approaches for evolution of propositional theories.We exhibit limitations of a number of model-based approaches: besides the fact that they areeither not expressible in DL− Lite or hard to compute; they intrinsically ignore the structuralproperties of KBs; which leads to undesired properties of KBs resulting from such anevolution. We also examine proposals on update and revision of DL KBs that adopt themodel-based approaches and discuss their drawbacks. We show that known formula …,The Semantic Web–ISWC 2010,2010,108

Deciding equivalences among aggregate queries,Werner Nutt; Yehoshus Sagiv; Sara Shurin,Abstract Equivalcncc of aggregate queries is investigated for the class of conjunctive querieswith comparisons and the aggregate operators min; max; count; count-distinct; and sum.Essentlally; this class contains all unnested SQL queries with the above aggregateoperators; with a WHERE clause consisting of a conjunction of comparisons; and without aHAVING clause. The comparisons can be interpreted over either a dense order (c; g.; overthe rationals) or a discrete order (eg; over the integers). Generally; however; differenttechniques and characterizations are needed in each of these two case-s. For queries witheither max or min; equivalence is characterlzcd in terms of dominance mappings; which canbe viewed aa a goncralization of containment mappings.

EquiX–easy querying in XML databases,Sara Cohen; Yaron Kanza; Yakov Kogan; Werner Nutt; Yehoshua Sagiv; Alexander Serebrenik,The Web is explored by many users; but only a few of them have experience in using querylanguages. Thus; one of the greatest challenges; provided by XML; is to create a querylanguage simple enough for the naive user. In this paper; we present EquiX| a powerful andeasy to use query language for XML. The main goal in designing EquiX is to strike the rightbalance between expressive power and simplicity. EquiX has a form-based GUI that isconstructed automatically from the DTDs of XML documents. Query forms are built from wellknown HTML primitives. The result of a query in EquiX is a collection of XML documents;and it is automatically generated from the query without explicit speci cation of the format ofthe result. Knowledge of XML syntax is not required in order to use EquiX. Yet; EquiX is ableto express rather complicated queries; containing quanti cation; negation and …,WebDB (Informal Proceedings),1999,64
On the expressivity of feature logics with negation; functional uncertainty; and sort equations,Franz Baader; Hans-Jürgen Bürckert; Bernhard Nebel; Werner Nutt; Gert Smolka,Abstract Feature logics are the logical basis for so-called unification grammars studied incomputational linguistics. We investigate the expressivity of feature terms with negation andthe functional uncertainty construct needed for the description of long-distancedependencies and obtain the following results: satisfiability of feature terms is undecidable;sort equations can be internalized; consistency of sort equations is decidable if there is atleast one atom; and consistency of sort equations is undecidable if there is no atom.,Journal of Logic; Language and Information,1993,64
Concept Logics,Franz Baader; Hans-Jürgen Bürckert; Bernhard Hollunder; Werner Nutt; Jörg H Siekmann,Abstract Concept languages (as used in BACK; KL-ONE; KRYPTON; LOOM) are employedas knowledge representation formalisms in Artificial Intelligence. Their main purpose is torepresent the generic concepts and the taxonomical hierarchies of the domain to bemodeled. This paper addresses the combination of the fast taxonomical reasoningalgorithms (eg subsumption; the classifier etc.) that come with these languages andreasoning in first order predicate logic. The interface between these two different modes ofreasoning is accomplished by a new rule of inference; called constrained resolution.Correctness; completeness as well as the decidability of the constraints (in a restrictedconstraint language) are shown.,*,1990,60
Completeness of queries over incomplete databases,Simon Razniewski; Werner Nutt,ABSTRACT Data completeness is an important aspect of data quality as in many scenarios itis crucial to guarantee completeness of query answers. We develop techniques to concludethe completeness of query answers from information about the completeness of parts of agenerally incomplete database. In our framework; completeness of a database can bedescribed in two ways: by table completeness (TC) statements; which say that certain partsof a relation are complete; and by query completeness (QC) statements; which say that theset of answers of a query is complete. We identify as core problem to decide whether tablecompleteness entails query completeness (TC-QC). We develop decision procedures andassess the complexity of TC-QC inferences depending on the languages of the TC and QCstatements. We show that in important cases weakest preconditions for query …,*,2011,55
Rewriting queries with arbitrary aggregation functions using views,Sara Cohen; Werner Nutt; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract The problem of rewriting aggregate queries using views is studied for conjunctivequeries with arbitrary aggregation functions and built-in predicates. Two types of queriesover views are introduced for rewriting aggregate queries: pure candidates and aggregatecandidates. Pure candidates can be used to rewrite arbitrary aggregate queries. Aggregatecandidates can be used to rewrite queries containing aggregate functions definable in termsof a commutative-semigroup operation. For both types of candidates (as well as for severalrelaxations of these candidates); the unfolding property holds. This allows characterizationsfor query equivalence to be used to determine whether a candidate is a rewriting of a query.The complexity of the rewriting-existence problem is also studied and upper and lowercomplexity bounds are given.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2006,52
A refined architecture for terminological systems: Terminology= schema+ views,Martin Buchheit; Francesco M Donini; Werner Nutt; Andrea Schaerf,Abstract Traditionally; the core of a Terminological Knowledge Representation System(TKRS) consists of a TBox or terminology; where concepts are introduced; and an ABox orworld description; where facts about individuals are stated in terms of concept memberships.This design has a drawback because in most applications the TBox has to meet twofunctions at a time: On the one hand—similarly to a database schema—frame-like structureswith type information are introduced through primitive concepts and primitive roles; on theother hand; views on the objects in the knowledge base are provided through definedconcepts. We propose to account for this conceptual separation by partitioning the TBox intotwo components for primitive and defined concepts; which we call the schema and the viewpart. We envision the two parts to differ with respect to the language for concepts; the …,Artificial Intelligence,1998,49

Unification in monoidal theories,Werner Nutt,Abstract We study the unification problem for a class of equational theories that comprisesimportant examples like abelian monoids (AC); idempotent abelian monoids (ACI); andabelian groups. Monoidal theories have the common characteristic that unificationalgorithms are based on solving linear equation systems over a semiring. The closecorrespondence between unification and linear algebra can be used to characterize theunification type of monoidal theories in purely algebraic terms; and an application of Hilbert'sBasis Theorem gives a sufficient criterion for a monoidal theory to be unitary.,10th International Conference on Automated Deduction,1990,49
Deciding equivalences among conjunctive aggregate queries,Sara Cohen; Werner Nutt; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract Equivalence of aggregate queries is investigated for the class of conjunctivequeries with comparisons and the aggregate operators count; count-distinct; min; max; andsum. Essentially; this class contains unnested SQL queries with the above aggregateoperators; with a where clause consisting of a conjunction of comparisons; and without ahaving clause. The comparisons are either interpreted over a domain with a dense order(like the rationals) or with a discrete order (like the integers). Characterizations ofequivalence differ for the two cases. For queries with either max or min; equivalence ischaracterized in terms of dominance mappings; which can be viewed as a generalization ofcontainment mappings. For queries with the count-distinct operator; a sufficient condition forequivalence is given in terms of equivalence of conjunctive queries under set semantics …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2007,47
Aggregate queries for discrete and continuous probabilistic XML,Serge Abiteboul; T-H Hubert Chan; Evgeny Kharlamov; Werner Nutt; Pierre Senellart,Abstract Sources of data uncertainty and imprecision are numerous. A way to handle thisuncertainty is to associate probabilistic annotations to data. Many such probabilisticdatabase models have been proposed; both in the relational and in the semi-structuredsetting. The latter is particularly well adapted to the management of uncertain data comingfrom a variety of automatic processes. An important problem; in the context of probabilisticXML databases; is that of answering aggregate queries (count; sum; avg; etc.); which hasreceived limited attention so far. In a model unifying the various (discrete) semi-structuredprobabilistic models studied up to now; we present algorithms to compute the distribution ofthe aggregation values (exploiting some regularity properties of the aggregate functions)and probabilistic moments (especially; expectation and variance) of this distribution.

Algorithms for rewriting aggregate queries using views,Sara Cohen; Werner Nutt; Alexander Serebrenik,Abstract Queries involving aggregation are typical in database applications. One of the mainideas to optimize the execution of an aggregate query is to reuse results of previouslyanswered queries. This leads to the problem of rewriting aggregate queries using views.Due to a lack of theory; algorithms for this problem were rather ad-hoc. They were sound; butwere not proven to be complete. Recently we have given syntactic characterizations for theequivalence of aggregate queries and applied them to decide when there exist rewritings.However; these decision procedures do not lend themselves immediately to animplementation. In this paper; we present practical algorithms for rewriting queries withcount and sum. Our algorithms are sound. They are also complete for important cases. Ourtechniques can be used to improve well-known procedures for rewriting non-aggregate …,Current Issues in Databases and Information Systems,2000,46
On the translation of qualitative spatial reasoning problems into modal logics,Werner Nutt,Abstract We introduce topological set constraints that express qualitative spatial relationsbetween regions. The constraints are interpreted over topological spaces. We show how totranslate our constraints into formulas of a multimodal propositional logic and give a rigorousproof that this translation preserves satisfiability. As a consequence; the known algorithmsfor reasoning in modal logics can be applied to qualitative spatial reasoning. Our results laya formal foundation to previous work by Bennett; Nebel; Renz; and others on spatialreasoning in the RCC8 formalism.,KI-99: Advances in Artificial Intelligence,1999,44
Containment of aggregate queries,Sara Cohen; Werner Nutt; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract The problem of deciding containment of aggregate queries is investigated.Containment is reduced to equivalence for queries with expandable aggregation functions.Many common aggregation functions; such as max; cntd (count distinct); count; sum; avg;median and stdev (standard deviation) are shown to be expandable. It is shown that even inthe presence of integrity constraints; containment can be reduced to equivalence. Forconjunctive count and sum-queries; simpler characterizations for containment are given; thatdo not require checking equivalence. These results are built upon in order to solve theproblem of finding maximally-contained sets of rewritings for conjunctive count-queries.,Database Theory—ICDT 2003,2002,42

Equivalences among aggregate queries with negation,Sara Cohen; Yehoshua Sagiv; Werner Nutt,Abstract Query equivalence is investigated for disjunctive aggregate queries with negatedsubgoals; constants and comparisons. A full characterization of equivalence is given for theaggregation functions count; max; sum; prod; top2 and parity. A related problem is that ofdetermining; for a given natural number N; whether two given queries are equivalent over alldatabases with at most N constants. This problem is called bounded equivalence. Acomplete characterization of decidability of bounded equivalence is given. In particular; it isshown that this problem is decidable for all the above aggregation functions as well as forcntd (count distinct) and avg.

Configuration as model construction: The constructive problem solving approach,R Klein; M Buchheit; Werner Nutt,Abstract Configuration is distinguished by two important aspects: the inherent well-structuredness of the problem description; and the synthetic type of problem solving. Up tonow there is quite a number of (more or less) ad hoc approaches to configuration—but weare still missing a comprehensive formal treatment. In order to be adequate a formalizationof configuration has to take both aspects into account: the well-structuredness and thesynthetic problem solving type. In this paper we introduce a formalisation of configuration;called the Constructive Problem Solving (CPS). CPS formalizes the task to construct for agiven specification; which is described as a finite set of logical formulas; a semantical modelthat satisfies the specification. In this approach; a specification consists of two parts. One partdescribes the domain; the possible components; and their interdependencies.

Querying incomplete information in semistructured data,Yaron Kanza; Werner Nutt; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract Semistructured data occur in situations where information lacks a homogeneousstructure and is incomplete. Yet; up to now the incompleteness of information has not beenreflected by special features of query languages. Our goal is to investigate the principles ofqueries that allow for incomplete answers. We do not present; however; a concrete querylanguage. Queries over classical structured data models contain a number of variables andconstraints on these variables. An answer is a binding of the variables by elements of thedatabase such that the constraints are satisfied. In the present paper; we loosen this conceptin so far as we allow also answers that are partial; that is; not all variables in the query arebound by such an answer. Partial answers make it necessary to refine the model of queryevaluation. The first modification relates to the satisfaction of constraints: in some …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2002,34

Completeness statements about RDF data sources and their use for query answering,Fariz Darari; Werner Nutt; Giuseppe Pirro; Simon Razniewski,Abstract With thousands of RDF data sources available on the Web covering disparate andpossibly overlapping knowledge domains; the problem of providing high-level descriptions(in the form of metadata) of their content becomes crucial. In this paper we introduce atheoretical framework for describing data sources in terms of their completeness. We showhow existing data sources can be described with completeness statements expressed inRDF. We then focus on the problem of the completeness of query answering over plain andRDFS data sources augmented with completeness statements. Finally; we present anextension of the completeness framework for federated data sources.,International Semantic Web Conference,2013,31

Constructive problem solving: A model construction approach towards configuration,Martin Buchheit; Rüdiger Klein; Werner Nutt,In this paper we give a formalisation of configuration as the task to construct for a givenspecification; which is understood as a finite set of logical formulas; a model that satisfies thespecification. In this approach; a specification consists of two parts. One part describes thedomain; the possible components; and their interdependencies. The other part specifies theparticular object that is to be configured. The language that is used to represent knowledgeabout configuration problems integrates three sublanguages that allow one to expressconstraints; to build up taxonomies; and to define rules. We give a sound calculus by whichone can compute solutions to configuration problems if they exist and that allows one torecognize that a specification is inconsistent. In particular; the calculus can be used in orderto check whether a given configuration satisfies the specification.,*,1995,25
Queries; rules and definitions as epistemic sentences in concept languages,Francesco Donini; Maurizio Lenzerini; Daniele Nardi; Werner Nutt; Andrea Schaerf,Abstract Concept languages have been studied in order to give a formal account of the basicfeatures of frame-based languages. The focus of research in concept languages was initiallyon the semantical reconstruction of frame-based systems and the computational complexityof reasoning. More recently; attention has been paid to the formalization of other aspects offrame-based languages; such as non-monotonic reasoning and procedural rules; which arenecessary in order to bring concept languages closer to implemented systems. In this paperwe discuss the above issues in the framework of concept languages enriched with anepistemic operator. In particular; we show that the epistemic operator both introduces novelfeatures in the language; such as sophisticated query formulation and closed worldreasoning; and makes it possible to provide a formal account for some aspects of the …,Foundations of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning,1994,25
Web-based graphical querying of databases through an ontology: the WONDER system,Diego Calvanese; C Maria Keet; Werner Nutt; Mariano Rodríguez-Muro; Giorgio Stefanoni,Abstract Biological scientists have made large amounts of data available on the Web; whichcan be accessed by canned or precomputed queries presented via web forms. To satisfyfurther information needs; users currently have to have a good understanding of SQL andhow the data is stored in the database. While accessing information at the ontological layerseems more appropriate; this poses two challenges:(1) to query data in databases and triplestores through an ontology with little performance overhead; and (2) to provide an intuitiveweb-based access to users that are not IT experts. To address these issues; we draw uponthe theory and technology developed for Ontology-Based Data Access for DL-Lite. With anOWL ontology and the DIG-QuOnto reasoner as building blocks; we have developed anapplication that allows for graphical ontology browsing; query formulation; and answer …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM symposium on applied computing,2010,24
Containment of conjunctive queries over databases with null values,Carles Farré; Werner Nutt; Ernest Teniente; Toni Urpí,Abstract We study containment of conjunctive queries that are evaluated over databases thatmay contain tuples with null values. We assume the semantics of SQL for single blockqueries with a SELECT DISTINCT clause. This problem (“null containment” for short) isdifferent from containment over databases without null values and sometimes more difficult.We show that null-containment for boolean conjunctive queries is NP-complete while it is\mathitΠ^\rmP_2-complete for queries with distinguished variables. However; if no relationsymbol is allowed to appear more than twice; then null-containment is polynomial; as it is fordatabases without nulls. If we add a unary test predicate IS NULL; as it is available in SQL;then containment becomes \mathitΠ^\rmP_2-hard for boolean queries; while it remains in\mathitΠ^\rmP_2 for arbitrary queries.,Database Theory–ICDT 2007,2006,24

Updating probabilistic XML,Evgeny Kharlamov; Werner Nutt; Pierre Senellart,Abstract We investigate the complexity of performing updates on probabilistic XML data forvarious classes of probabilistic XML documents of different succinctness. We consider twoelementary kinds of updates; insertions and deletions; that are defined with the help of alocator query that specifies the nodes where the update is to be performed. For insertions;two semantics are considered; depending on whether a node is to be inserted once or forevery match of the query. We first discuss deterministic updates over probabilistic XML; andthen extend the algorithms and complexity bounds to probabilistic updates. In addition to anumber of intractability results; our main result is an efficient algorithm for insertions definedwith branching-free queries over probabilistic models with local dependencies. Finally; wediscuss the problem of updating probabilistic XML databases with continuous probability …,Proceedings of the 2010 EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2010,21
But What Do We Actually Know?,Simon Razniewski; Fabian Suchanek; Werner Nutt,Abstract Knowledge bases such as Wikidata; DBpedia; YAGO; or the Google KnowledgeVault collect a vast number of facts about the world. But while quite some facts are knownabout the world; little is known about how much is unknown. For example; while theknowledge base may tell us that Barack Obama is the father of Malia Obama and SashaObama; it does not tell us whether these are all of his children. This is not just an epistemicchallenge; but also a practical problem for data producers and consumers. We envision thatKBs become annotated with information about their recall on specific topics. We show whatsuch annotations could look like; how they could be obtained; and survey related work.,Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Automated Knowledge Base Construction,2016,20
Querying semantically tagged documents on the World-Wide Web,Ziv Bar-Yossef; Yaron Kanza; Yakov Kogan; Yehoshua Sagiv; Werner Nutt,Abstract QUEST is a system for Querying Semantically Tagged documents on the World-Wide Web. The advent of new markup languages; such as xml; facilitates authoring of Webdocuments that contain not just html tags for instructing a browser how to view a document;but also contain objects that represent the semantic structure of the document. When suchdocuments become widely available; more powerful methods to access and queryinformation on the Web will be possible. The QUEST system was designed andimplemented for querying and manipulating documents written in the markup languageohtml. ohtml combines html and objects of the oem data model. QUEST has several newfeatures. First; QUEST can be used to query a combination of hypertext and objectstructures. Second; The results of queries are ohtml pages and thus of the same type as …,Next Generation Information Technologies and Systems,1999,18
Identifying the extent of completeness of query answers over partially complete databases,Simon Razniewski; Flip Korn; Werner Nutt; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract In many applications including loosely coupled cloud databases; collaborativeediting and network monitoring; data from multiple sources is regularly used for queryanswering. For reasons such as system failures; insufficient author knowledge or networkissues; data may be temporarily unavailable or generally nonexistent. Hence; not all dataneeded for query answering may be available. In this paper; we propose a natural class ofcompleteness patterns; expressed by selections on database tables; to specify completeparts of database tables. We then show how to adapt the operators of relational algebra sothat they manipulate these completeness patterns to compute completeness patternspertaining to query answers. Our proposed algebra is computationally sound and completewith respect to the information that the patterns provide. We show that stronger …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,17
Fault tolerance in the R-GMA Information and Monitoring System,Rob Byrom; Brian Coghlan; Andy Cooke; Roney Cordenonsi; Linda Cornwall; Martin Craig; Abdeslem Djaoui; Alastair Duncan; Steve Fisher; Alasdair Gray; Steve Hicks; Stuart Kenny; Jason Leake; Oliver Lyttleton; James Magowan; Robin Middleton; Werner Nutt; David O’Callaghan; Norbert Podhorszki; Paul Taylor; John Walk; Antony Wilson,Abstract R-GMA (Relational Grid Monitoring Architecture)[1] is a grid monitoring andinformation system that provides a global view of data distributed across a grid system. R-GMA creates the impression of a single centralised repository of information; but in realitythe information can be stored at many different locations on the grid. The Registry andSchema are key components of R-GMA. The Registry matches queries for information todata sources that provide the appropriate information. The Schema defines the tables thatcan be queried. Without the combined availability of these components; R-GMA ceases tooperate as a useful service. This paper presents an overview of R-GMA and describes theRegistry replication design and implementation. A replication algorithm for the Schema hasalso been designed.,Advances in Grid Computing-EGC 2005,2005,15
Information and monitoring services within a Grid environment,AJ Wilson; R Byrom; LA Cornwall; MS Craig; A Djaoui; SM Fisher; S Hicks; A Cooke; AJG Gray; W Nutt; J Magowan; P Taylor; J Leake,Abstract The R-GMA (Relational Grid Monitoring Architecture) was developed within the EUDataGrid project; to bring the power of SQL to an information and monitoring system for thegrid. It provides producer and consumer services to both publish and retrieve informationfrom anywhere within a grid environment. Users within a Virtual Organization may definetheir own tables dynamically into which to publish data. Within the DataGrid project R-GMAwas used for the information system; making details about grid resources available for useby other middleware components. R-GMA has also been used for monitoring grid jobs bymembers of the CMS and D0 collaborations where information about jobs is published fromwithin a job,*,2004,15

Combining the power of searching and querying,Sara Cohen; Yaron Kanza; Yakov Kogan; Werner Nutt; Yehoshua Sagiv; Alexander Serebrenik,Abstract EquiX is a search language for XML that combines the power of querying with thesimplicity of searching. Requirements for search languages are discussed and it is shownthat EquiX meets the necessary criteria. Both a graphical abstract syntax and a formalconcrete syntax are presented for EquiX queries. In addition; the semantics is defined. It isshown that EquiX has an evaluation algorithm that is polynomial under combinedcomplexity. EquiX combines pattern matching; quantification and logical expressions toquery both the data and meta-data of XML documents. The result of a query in EquiX is a setof XML documents. A DTD describing the result documents is derived automatically from thequery.,Cooperative Information Systems,2000,15
Enabling fine-grained RDF data completeness assessment,Fariz Darari; Simon Razniewski; Radityo Eko Prasojo; Werner Nutt,Abstract Nowadays; more and more RDF data is becoming available on the Semantic Web.While the Semantic Web is generally incomplete by nature; on certain topics; it alreadycontains complete information and thus; queries may return all answers that exist in reality.In this paper we develop a technique to check query completeness based on RDF dataannotated with completeness information; taking into account data-specific inferences thatlead to an inference problem which is\varPi^ P_2-complete. We then identify a practicallyrelevant fragment of completeness information; suitable for crowdsourced; entity-centric RDFdata sources such as Wikidata; for which we develop an indexing technique that allows toscale completeness reasoning to Wikidata-scale data sources. We verify the applicability ofour framework using Wikidata and develop COOL-WD; a completeness tool for Wikidata …,International Conference on Web Engineering,2016,14
Capturing continuous data and answering aggregate queries in probabilistic XML,Serge Abiteboul; T-H Hubert Chan; Evgeny Kharlamov; Werner Nutt; Pierre Senellart,Abstract Sources of data uncertainty and imprecision are numerous. A way to handle thisuncertainty is to associate probabilistic annotations to data. Many such probabilisticdatabase models have been proposed; both in the relational and in the semi-structuredsetting. The latter is particularly well adapted to the management of uncertain data comingfrom a variety of automatic processes. An important problem; in the context of probabilisticXML databases; is that of answering aggregate queries (count; sum; avg; etc.); which hasreceived limited attention so far. In a model unifying the various (discrete) semi-structuredprobabilistic models studied up to now; we present algorithms to compute the distribution ofthe aggregation values (exploiting some regularity properties of the aggregate functions)and probabilistic moments (especially expectation and variance) of this distribution.

Updating ABoxes in DL-Lite,Diego Calvanese; Evgeny Kharlamov; Werner Nutt; Dmitriy Zheleznyakov,Abstract: We study the problem of instance level (ABox) updates for Knowledge Bases (KBs)represented in Description Logics of the DL-Lite family. DL-Lite is at the basis of OWL 2 QL;one of the tractable fragments of OWL 2; the recently proposed revision of the Web OntologyLanguage. We examine known works on updates that follow the model-based approach anddiscuss their drawbacks. Speciﬁcally; the fact that model-based approaches intrinsicallyignore the structural properties of KBs; leads to undesired properties of updates computedaccording to such semantics. Hence; we propose two novel formula-based approaches; andfor each of them we develop a polynomial time algorithm to compute ABox updates for theDescription Logic DL-LiteFR.,Proceedings of the 4th Alberto Mendelzon International Workshop on Foundations of Data Management (AMW10),2010,14
Combination problems for commutative/monoidal theories or How algebra can help in equational unification,Franz Baader; Werner Nutt,Abstract We study the class of theories for which solving unification problems is equivalent tosolving systems of linear equations over a semiring. It encompasses important examples likethe theories of Abelian monoids; idempotent Abelian monoids; and Abelian groups. Thisclass has been introduced by the authors independently of each other as “commutativetheories”(Baader) and “monoidal theories”(Nutt). We show that commutative theories andmonoidal theories indeed define the same class (modulo a translation of the signature); andwe prove that it is undecidable whether a given theory belongs to it. In the remainder of thepaper we investigate combinations of commutative/monoidal theories with other theories.We show that finitary commutative/monoidal theories always satisfy the requirements forapplying general methods developed for the combination of unification algorithms for …,Applicable Algebra in Engineering; Communication and Computing,1996,14
On Abduction and Answer Generation through Constrained Resolution,Hans-Jürgen Bürckert; Werner Nutt,Recently; extensions of constrained logic programming and constrained resolution fortheorem proving have been introduced; that consider constraints; which are interpretedunder an open world assumption. We discuss relationships between applications of theseapproaches for query answering in knowledge base systems on the one hand andabduction-based hypothetical reasoning on the other hand. We show both that constrainedresolution can be used as an operationalization of (some limited form of) abduction and thatabduction is the logical status of an answer generation process through constrainedresolution; ie.; it is an abductive but not a deductive form of reasoning.,*,1992,14
The unification hierarchy is undecidable,Werner Nutt,Abstract In unification theory; equational theories can be classified according to theexistence and cardinality of minimal complete solution sets for equation systems. For unitary;finitary; and infinitary theories minimal complete solution sets always exist and aresingletons; finite; or possibly infinite sets; respectively. In nullary theories; minimal completesets do not exist for some equation systems. These classes form the unification hierarchy.We show that it is not possible to decide where a given equational theory resides in theunification hierarchy. Moreover; it is proved that for some classes this problem is not evenrecursively enumerable.,Journal of Automated Reasoning,1991,13
MAGIK: managing completeness of data,Ognjen Savković; Mirza Paramita; Sergey Paramonov; Werner Nutt,Abstract MAGIK demonstrates how to use meta-information about the completeness of adatabase to assess the quality of the answers returned by a query. The system holds so-called table-completeness (TC) statements; by which one can express that a table is partiallycomplete; that is; it contains all facts about some aspect of the domain. Given a query;MAGIK determines from such meta-information whether the database contains sufficientdata for the query answer to be complete. If; according to the TC statements; the databasecontent is not sufficient for a complete answer; MAGIK explains which further TC statementsare needed to guarantee completeness.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,12
Stream integration techniques for grid monitoring,Andy Cooke; Alasdair Gray; Werner Nutt,Abstract Grids are distributed systems that provide access to computational resources in atransparent fashion. Providing information about the status of the Grid itself is called Gridmonitoring. As an approach to this problem; we present the Relational Grid MonitoringArchitecture (R-GMA); which tackles Grid monitoring as an information integration problem.A novel feature of R-GMA is its support for integrating stream data via a simple “local asview” approach. We describe the infrastructure that R-GMA provides for publishing andquerying monitoring data. In this context; we discuss the semantics of continuous queries;provide characterisations of query plans; and present an algorithm for computing suchplans. The concepts and mechanisms offered by R-GMA are general and can be applied inother areas where there is a need for publishing and querying information in a distributed …,Journal on data semantics II,2005,12
Unification in monoidal theories is solving linear equations over semirings,Werner Nutt; Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Künstliche Intelligenz,Although for numerous equational theories unification algorithms have been developedthere is still a lack of general methods. In this paper we apply algebraic techniques to thestudy of a whole class of theories; which we call monoidal. Our approach leads to generalresults on the structure of unification algorithms and the unification type of such theories. Anequational theory is monoidal if it contains a binary operation which is associative andcommutative; an identity for the binary operation; and an arbitrary number of unary symbolswhich are homomorphisms for the binary operation and the identity. Monoidal theoriesaxiomatize varieties of abelian monoids. Examples are the theories of abelian monoids(AC); idempotent abelian monoids (ACI); and abelian groups. To every monoidal theory weassociate a semiring. Intuitively; semirings are rings without subtraction. We show that …,*,1992,12
Adding homomorphisms to commutative/monoidal theories or how algebra can help in equational unification,Franz Baader; Werner Nutt,Abstract In this paper we consider the class of theories for which solving unificationproblems is equivalent to solving systems of linear equations over a semiring. This class hasbeen introduced by the authors independently of each other as commutative theories(Baader) and monoidal theories (Nutt). The class encompasses important examples like thetheories of abelian monoids; idempotent abelian monoids; and abelian groups. We identify alarge subclass of commutative/monoidal theories that are of unification type zero by studyingequations over the corresponding semiring. As a second result; we show with methods fromlinear algebra that unitary and finitary commutative/monoidal theories do not change theirunification type when they are augmented by a finite monoid of homomorphisms; and howalgorithms for the extended theory can be obtained from algorithms for the basic theory …,Rewriting Techniques and Applications,1991,12
Completeness of queries over SQL databases,Werner Nutt; Simon Razniewski,Abstract Data completeness is an important aspect of data quality. We consider a setting;where databases can be incomplete in two ways: records may be missing and records maycontain null values. We (i) formalize when the answer set of a query is complete in spite ofsuch incompleteness; and (ii) we introduce table completeness statements; by which onecan express that certain parts of a database are complete. We then study how to deducefrom a set of table-completeness statements that a query can be answered completely. Nullvalues as used in SQL are ambiguous. They can indicate either that no attribute value existsor that a value exists; but is unknown. We study completeness reasoning for the differentinterpretations. We show that in the combined case it is necessary to syntactically distinguishbetween different kinds of null values and present an encoding for doing that in standard …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,11
Updating TBoxes in DL-Lite,Dmitriy Zheleznyakov; Diego Calvanese; Evgeny Kharlamov; Werner Nutt,Abstract. We study the problem of updates for TBoxes represented in Description Logics ofthe DL-Lite family. DL-Lite is at the basis of OWL 2 QL; one of the tractable fragments of OWL2; the recently proposed revision of the Web Ontology Language. In this paper; we addressfor the first time the problem of updating TBoxes. We propose some principles that TBoxupdates should respect. We review known model-and formula-based approaches forupdates of logical theories; and exhibit limitations of model-based approaches to handleTBox updates. We propose a novel formula-based approach; and present a polynomial timealgorithm to compute TBox updates for DL-LiteFR. We also study the relationship betweenpropositional logic satisfiability for Horn clauses and computation of TBox updates for DL-Lite.,Proc. of DL,2010,10
A data stream publish/subscribe architecture with self-adapting queries,Alasdair Gray; Werner Nutt,Abstract In data stream applications; streams typically arise from a geographically distributedcollection of producers and may be queried by consumers; which may be distributed as well.In such a setting; a query can be seen as a subscription asking to be informed of all tuplesthat satisfy a specific condition. We propose to support the publishing and querying ofdistributed data streams by a publish/subscribe architecture. To enable such a system toscale to a large number of producers and consumers requires the introduction ofrepublishers which collect together data streams and make the merged stream available. Ifrepublishers consume from other republishers; a hierarchy of republishers results. Wepresent a formalism that allows distributed data streams; published by independent streamproducers; to be integrated as views on a mediated schema.

A proof theory for DL-Lite,Diego Calvanese; Evgeny Kharlamov; Werner Nutt,In this work we propose an alternative approach to inference in DL-Lite; based on areduction to reasoning in an extension of function-free Horn Logic (EHL). We develop acalculus for EHL and prove its soundness and completeness. We also show how to achievedecidability by means of a specific strategy; and how alternative strategies can lead toimproved results in specific cases. On the one hand; we propose a strategy that mimics thequery-answering technique based on first computing a query rewriting and then evaluatingit. On the other hand; we propose strategies that allow one to anticipate the grounding ofatoms; and that might lead to better performance in the case where the size of the TBox isnot dominated by the size of the data.,Proc. of DL,2007,9
Reasoning about structured objects: knowledge representation meets databases,Franz Baader; Martin Buchheit; Manfred A Jeusfeld; Werner Nutt,Abstract Structured objects are items with defined properties that are to be represented in acomputer system. Research in Knowledge Representation (KR) and in Database Design(DB) has produced languages for describing structured objects. Although different in theparticular means for defining properties; both areas share the goal of representing a part ofthe world in a structured way. Moreover; the rise of object-centred formalisms in the lastdecade has significantly influenced the convergence of languages.,The Knowledge Engineering Review,1995,9
Managing and consuming completeness information for wikidata using COOL-WD,Radityo Eko Prasojo; Fariz Darari; Simon Razniewski; Werner Nutt,Wikidata is a fast-growing; crowdsourced; and entity-centric KB that currently stores over 100million facts about more than 21 million entities. Such a vast amount of data gives rise to thequestion: How complete is information in Wikidata? It turns out that there is no easy answersince Wikidata currently lacks a means to describe the completeness of its storedinformation; as in; Which entities are complete for which properties?

Checking query completeness over incomplete data,Simon Razniewski; Werner Nutt,Abstract We study the problem of query completeness (QC) over partially completedatabases. Query completeness is an important goal of data quality assurance. Incompletedatabases can occur in many contexts; especially whenever many users are supposed toinsert data into the same database. Although the overall data can often not be guaranteed tobe complete; some information may exist about completeness of parts of the data; eg;completeness of parts of tables. Given a query; the question arises whether that informationimplies that the query returns the same set of answers over the available data as it wouldover the complete database.,Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Logic in Databases,2011,8
Condensative stream query language for data streams,Lisha Ma; Werner Nutt; Hamish Taylor,Abstract In contrast to traditional database queries; a query on stream data is continuous inthat it is periodically evaluated over fractions (sliding windows) of the data stream. Thisintroduces challenges beyond those encountered when processing traditional queries. Overa traditional DBMS (Database Management System); the answer to an aggregate query isusually much smaller than the answer to a similar non-aggregate query making queryprocessing condensative. Current proposals for declarative query languages over datastreams do not support such condensative processing. Nor is it yet well understood whatquery constructs and what semantics should be adopted for continuous query languages. Inorder to make existing stream query languages more expressive; a novel stream querylanguage CSQL (Condensative Stream Query Language) are proposed over a sequence …,Proceedings of the eighteenth conference on Australasian database-Volume 63,2007,8
Implementing query completeness reasoning,Werner Nutt; Sergey Paramonov; Ognjen Savkovic,Abstract Data completeness is commonly regarded as one of the key aspects of data quality.With this paper we make two main contributions:(i) we develop techniques to reason aboutthe completeness of a query answer over a partially complete database; taking into accountconstraints that hold over the database; and (ii) we implement them by an encoding intologic programming paradigms. As constraints we consider primary and foreign keys as wellas finite domain constraints. In this way we can identify more situations in which a query iscomplete than was possible with previous work. For each combination of constraints; weestablish characterizations of the completeness reasoning and we show how to translatethem into logic programs. As a proof of concept we ran our encodings against test cases thatcapture characteristics of a real-world scenario.,Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2015,7
Entity and aspect extraction for organizing news comments,Radityo Eko Prasojo; Mouna Kacimi; Werner Nutt,Abstract News websites give their users the opportunity to participate in discussions aboutpublished articles; by writing comments. Typically; these comments are unstructured makingit hard to understand the flow of user discussions. Thus; there is a need for organizingcomments to help users to (1) gain more insights about news topics; and (2) have an easyaccess to comments that trigger their interests. In this work; we address the above problemby organizing comments around the entities and the aspects they discuss. More specifically;we propose an approach for entity and aspect extraction from user comments through thefollowing contributions. First; we extend traditional Named-Entity Recognition approaches;using coreference resolution and external knowledge bases; to detect more occurrences ofentities in comments.

Assessing the completeness of geographical data,Simon Razniewski; Werner Nutt,Abstract Geographical databases are often incomplete; especially when built upincrementally and by volunteers. A prominent example is OpenStreetMap. Often suchdatabases contain also metadata saying that certain features are completely captured forcertain areas. We show how to use such metadata to analyse in which areas queries returna complete answer. Such “completeness areas” can be computed via standard spatialoperations. Still larger completeness areas can be derived if not only metadata but also theactual content of the database is taken into account. Finally; we discuss which challengesarise if one wants to practically utilize the completeness metadata in OpenStreetMap.,British National Conference on Databases,2013,7
Combining production systems and ontologies,Martín Rezk; Werner Nutt,Abstract Production systems are an established paradigm in knowledge representation;while ontologies are widely used to model and reason about the domain of an application.Description logics; underlying for instance the Web ontology language OWL; are a well-studied formalism to express ontologies. In this work we combine production systems (ps)and Description Logics (dl) in such a way that allows one to express both; facts and rules;using an ontology language. We explore the space of design options for combining thetraditional closed world semantics of PS with the open world semantics of dl and propose ageneric semantics for such combination. We show how to encode our semantics in a fixpointextension of first-order logic. We show that in special cases (monotonic and light ps)checking properties of the system such as termination is decidable.,International Conference on Web Reasoning and Rule Systems,2011,7
Value joins are expensive over (probabilistic) XML,Evgeny Kharlamov; Werner Nutt; Pierre Senellart,Abstract We address the cost of adding value joins to tree-pattern queries and monadicsecond-order queries over trees in terms of the tractability of query evaluation over two datamodels: XML and probabilistic XML. Our results show that the data complexity rises fromlinear; for join-free queries; to intractable; for queries with value joins; while combinedcomplexity remains essentially the same. For tree-pattern queries with joins (TPJ) thecomplexity jump is only on probabilistic XML; while for monadic second-order logic overtrees with joins (TMSOJ) it already appears for deterministic XML documents. Moreover; forTPJ queries that have a single join; we show a dichotomy: every query is either essentiallyjoin-free; and in this case it is tractable over probabilistic XML; or it is intractable. In this lightwe study the problem of deciding whether a query with joins is essentially join-free. For …,Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Logic in Databases,2011,7
Verification of query completeness over processes,Simon Razniewski; Marco Montali; Werner Nutt,Abstract Data completeness is an essential aspect of data quality; and has in turn a hugeimpact on the effective management of companies. For example; statistics are computed andaudits are conducted in companies by implicitly placing the strong assumption that theanalysed data are complete. In this work; we are interested in studying the problem ofcompleteness of data produced by business processes; to the aim of automaticallyassessing whether a given database query can be answered with complete information in acertain state of the process. We formalize so-called quality-aware processes that create datain the real world and store it in the company's information system possibly at a later point.We then show how one can check the completeness of database queries in a certain state ofthe process or after the execution of a sequence of actions; by leveraging on query …,*,2013,6
Incomplete databases: Missing records and missing values,Werner Nutt; Simon Razniewski; Gil Vegliach,Abstract Data completeness is an essential aspect of data quality as in many scenarios it iscrucial to guarantee the completeness of query answers. Data might be incomplete in twoways: records may be missing as a whole; or attribute values of a record may be absent;indicated by a null. We extend previous work by two of the authors [10] that dealt only withthe first aspect; to cover both missing records and missing attribute values. To this end; werefine the formalization of incomplete databases and identify the important special casewhere values of key attributes are always known. We show that in the presence of nulls;completeness of queries can be defined in several ways. We also generalize a previousapproach stating completeness of parts of a database; using so-called table completenessstatements. With this formalization in place; we define the main inferences for …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2012,6

In thispaper we argue that the extraction of such information could substantially increase thescope of knowledge bases.

Onthe other hand; SPARQL; the standard query language over RDF; usually follows the Closed-World Assumption; assuming RDF data to be complete. This gives rise to a semantic gapbetween RDF and SPARQL. In this paper; we address how to close the semantic gapbetween RDF and SPARQL in terms of certain answers and possible answers usingcompleteness statements.,International Semantic Web Conference (Posters & Demos),2014,5
Complete approximations of incomplete queries,Ognjen Savković; Paramita Mirza; Alex Tomasi; Werner Nutt,Abstract We present a system that computes for a query that may be incomplete; completeapproximations from above and from below. We assume a setting where queries are posedover a partially complete database; that is; a database that is generally incomplete; but isknown to contain complete information about specific aspects of its application domain.Which parts are complete; is described by a set of so-called table-completeness statements.Previous work led to a theoretical framework and an implementation that allowed one todetermine whether in such a scenario a given conjunctive query is guaranteed to return acomplete set of answers or not.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,5
An ASP approach to query completeness reasoning,Werner Nutt; Sergey Paramonov; Ognjen Savkovic,We address the problem to determine whether a query over a partially complete databasecan be answered completely; which arises in data integration and decision support. Usingso-called table completeness statements; one asserts which parts of a database arecomplete. The question then is whether these are sufficient to retrieve the same answers asif the database had complete information about the domain of application. Previous work inthe area of databases has characterized the complexity of the problem; but did not come upwith a practical implementation. In this paper we explore ASP engines as a possible platformto execute completeness reasoning problems. We first generalize the problem by taking intoaccount finite domain constraints and then translate it into rules that may have disjunctionsin the heads. The translation allows us to encode completeness problems into cautious …,*,2013,5

Note thatthroughout we use the term information; for what some may prefer to call data. Motivation forthe work (problems addressed): The existing LDAP based solutions do not fully meet theEuropean DataGrid requirements because of lack of support for the join operation;unsuitability for application monitoring and no support for streaming of data. With the newlydeveloped GMA from the GGF we felt that it would be possible to devise a system which wascompatible with this architecture and suitable not only for monitoring (both of the Grid and …,WP3; UK e-Science all hands conference; Sheffield,2002,5
Incomplete answers for queries over semistructured data,Yaron Kanza; Werner Nutt; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract Semistructured data are inherently incomplete and their structure does not complywith a strict schema. A query language has to take this into account and allow answers to beincomplete. This paper presents a model of queries over semistructured data that allows forincomplete answers; ie; answers in which not all the variables of the query are bound. Wede ne a simple data model that is similar to OEM PGMW95]. For this data model we presentthe concept of a query language based on constraints. The paper describes the di erentconstraints that are used in the query and the di erent phases needed for evaluating them.We propose the concept of maximal answers that are obtained by matching a maximalportion of the database graph with the query constraints. Maximal matchings and constraintsthat can be evaluated over partial data give us the ability to retrieve partial answers when …,Proceedings of the 6th International Workshop on Knowledge Representation meets Databases (KRDB'99),1999,5
Expanding Wikidata's Parenthood Information by 178%; or How To Mine Relation Cardinalities,Paramita Mirza; Simon Razniewski; Werner Nutt,Abstract. While so far automated knowledge base construction has largely focused on fullyqualified facts; eg;(Obama; hasChild; Malia); the Web contains also extensive amounts ofexistential information in the form of cardinality assertions; eg; that someone has twochildren without giving their names. In this paper we argue that the extraction of suchinformation could substantially increase the scope of knowledge bases. For the sample ofthe hasChild relation in Wikidata; we show that simple regular-expression based extractionfrom Wikipedia can increase the size of the relation by 178%. We also show how suchcardinality information can be used to estimate the recall of knowledge bases.,ISWC 2016 Posters & Demonstrations Trac,2016,4
Towards a Theory of Query Stability in Business Processes.,Elisa Marengo; Werner Nutt; Ognjen Savkovic,Data quality has attracted attention in theoretical database research in the past few yearsand different aspects; such as consistency; accuracy; currency; and completeness havebeen investigated [1–3]. One of the main factors that determine data quality is where andhow data originate. We believe that analyzing how business processes generate dataallows one to gather additional information on their fitness for use. Specifically; we want tounderstand whether an ongoing business process that reads from and writes into adatabase can affect the answer to a query or whether the answer is stable; that is; it will notchange as a result of the process. As motivating example consider the student registration atthe University of Bozen-Bolzano. In November the student office distributed a report showingthe numbers of students enrolled in the offered courses. When comparing the numbers …,AMW,2014,4
Frequency operators for condensative queries over data streams,Lisha Ma; Werner Nutt,Over a traditional database management system (DBMS); the answer to an aggregate queryis usually much smaller than the answer to a similar non-aggregate query. Therefore; we callsuch a query" condensative". Current proposals for declarative query languages over datastreams do not support such condensative querying. In order to make existing stream querylanguages more expressive so that they enable a user both; to state more intuitivelyinteresting queries; and to support condensative querying; we propose a new data streammodel; referred to as the sequence model; and an extension to SQL-like query languages byoperators that allows one to specify the frequency by which a query returns answer tuples.We show that such frequency operators allow one to express sampling over streams. Ifcombined with existing sliding window operators; they support queries with" jumping …,e-Business Engineering; 2005. ICEBE 2005. IEEE International Conference on,2005,4

Expressing no-value information in RDF,Fariz Darari; Radityo Eko Prasojo; Werner Nutt,RDF is a data model to represent positive information. Consequently; it is not clear how torepresent the non-existence of information in RDF. We present a technique to express suchinformation in RDF and incorporate it into SPARQL query answering. Given an empty queryanswer; our technique can distinguish whether it is empty due to possibly incompleteinformation; or non-existent information.,*,2015,3
CORNER: A completeness reasoner for SPARQL queries over RDF data sources,Fariz Darari; Radityo Eko Prasojo; Werner Nutt,Abstract With the increased availability of data on the Semantic Web; the question whetherdata sources offer data of appropriate quality for a given purpose becomes an issue. WithCORNER; we specifically address the data quality aspect of completeness. CORNERsupports SPARQL BGP queries and can take RDFS ontologies into account in its analysis. Ifa query can only be answered completely by a combination of sources; CORNER rewritesthe original query into one with SPARQL SERVICE calls; which assigns each query part to asuitable source; and executes it over those sources.

Sources of incompleteness in grid publishing,Alasdair Gray; Werner Nutt; M Williams,Abstract There is a wide variety of data; both static and streaming; being published on andabout computing Grids. However one aspect of Grid data that has received relatively littleattention thus far is that of incompleteness. With potentially many data sources available tochoose from; each with its own limitations in terms of coverage of data sets and of overallreliability; there are many opportunities for inaccuracy due to incompleteness in the data. Inthis short paper different types of incompleteness are identified in the context of R-GMA aspart of an ongoing research project aimed at finding solutions to some of these.,Flexible and Efficient Information Handling,2006,3

Intelligent access to heterogeneous information sources: report on the 4th workshop on knowledge representation meets databases,Franz Baader; Manfred A.  Jeusfeld; Werner Nutt,Integrated access to heterogeneous information is an increasingly important topic as moreand more sources that developed independently from each other become accessible overnetworks. The structure of the information and the abilities of the sources to answer queriesmay vary widely. Therefore; systems are needed that are able to use knowledge about thecontents and the capabilities of sources to break down a global query into portions that canbe processed locally and to reassemble the answers. Problems of this kind arise when onewants to access information on the internet or on intranets; or when one wants to build adatawarehouse that integrates and consolidates data from di erent databases in a largeinstitution.

As a result of these investigations; it is knownthat subsumption determination is at least NP-hard or even undecidable for reasonablyexpressive languages. The developers of terminological representation systems usuallyhave reacted to this problem in one of the following two ways. On the one hand; there aresystems such as CLASSIC which support only a very limited terminological language; butemploy almost complete reasoning methods. On the other hand; systems such as LOOMprovide for a very powerful language; but the reasoning is incomplete; which means that notall existing subsumption relationships are detected.

Query Stability in Data-aware Business Processes,Ognjen Savkovic; Elisa Marengo; Werner Nutt,Data quality focuses on understanding how much data is fit for its intended use. Thisproblem has been investigated in database research; considering aspects such asconsistency; currency; and completeness [6; 11; 19].

For example; statistics are computed andaudits are conducted in companies by implicitly placing the strong assumption that theanalysed data are complete. In this work; we are interested in studying the problem ofcompleteness of data produced by business processes; to the aim of automaticallyassessing whether a given database query can be answered with complete information in acertain state of the process. We formalize so-called quality-aware processes that create datain the real world and store it in the company's information system possibly at a later point.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1306.1689,2013,2
Incompleteness in information integration,Evgeny Kharlamov; Werner Nutt,Abstract Information integration is becoming a critical problem for both businesses andindividuals.

At the same time research in (virtual) integration in thecommunity focusses on null-free sources and addresses limited forms of incompletenessonly. In our work we aim to extend current results on virtual integration by consideringvarious forms of incompleteness at the level of the sources; the integrated database and thequeries (we call this Incomplete Information Integration; or III). More specifically; we aim toextend current query answering techniques for local-; and global-as-view integration tointegration of tables with SQL nulls; Codd tables; etc. We also aim to consider incomplete …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,2

One reason to change this situation is related to themethodology of doing research. ffl A formalization of configuration problems and solutionsfacilitates the communication of results within the field and with other areas. The degree towhich such a formalization has been achieved can be seen as an indicator for the degree ofmaturity of the field.

Long-term Optimization of Update Frequencies for Decaying Information,Simon Razniewski; Werner Nutt,Abstract Many kinds of information; such as addresses; crawls of webpages; or academicaffiliations; are prone to becoming outdated over time. Therefore; in some applications;updates are performed periodically in order to keep the correctness and usefulness of suchinformation high. As refreshing information usually has a cost; eg computation time; networkbandwidth or human work time; a problem is to find the right update frequency depending onthe benefit gained from the information and on the speed with which the information isexpected to get outdated. This is especially important since often entities exhibit a differentspeed of getting outdated; as; eg; addresses of students change more frequently thanaddresses of pensionists; or news portals change more frequently than personalhomepages. Thus; there is no uniform best update frequency for all entities.,Proceedings of the 18th International Workshop on Web and Databases,2015,1
Agrégation de documents XML probabilistes,Serge Abiteboul; T-H Hubert Chan; Evgeny Kharlamov; Werner Nutt; Pierre Senellart,The study of queries over imprecise data has generated much attention in the setting ofrelational databases [4; 9; 20; 28]. The Web (with HTML or XML data) in particular is animportant source of uncertain data; for instance; when dealing with imprecise automatictasks such as information extraction. A natural way to model this uncertainty is to annotatesemi-structured data with probabilities. Some works have recently addressed queries oversuch imprecise hierarchical information [2; 14; 15; 17; 19; 22; 26; 27].

Answering Arbitrary Conjunctive Queries over Incomplete Data Stream Histories.,Alasdair JG Gray; M Howard Williams; Werner Nutt,Abstract: Streams of data often originate from many distributed sources. A user wanting toquery the streams should not need to know from where each stream originates but shouldbe provided with a global view of the streams. R-GMA is a system that integrates distributeddata streams to provide a global view of all the streams for users to query. R-GMA has beendeveloped as a grid information and monitoring system although the techniques developedcan be applied wherever there is a need to publish and query distributed streams. Streamdata is important not only for its current values but also for past values produced. In order tosupport this; the history of the stream must be archived and stream processing systems mustsupport history queries. However; one problem which then arises is that data streamspublished by distributed sources are prone to missing data values; eg due to a network …,iiWAS,2006,1

Data integration techniques in grid monitoring,Andy Cooke; Alasdair JG Gray; Wernet Nutt,Abstract. Grids are distributed systems that provide access to computational resources in atransparent fashion. Collecting and providing information about the status of the Grid itself iscalled Grid monitoring. As an approach to this problem; we present the Relational GridMonitoring Architecture (R-GMA); which tackles Grid monitoring as an informationintegration problem. A novel feature of R-GMA is its support for integrating stream data via asimple “local as view” approach. We describe the infrastructure that R-GMA provides forpublishing and querying monitoring data. In this context; we discuss the semantics ofcontinuous queries; provide characterisations of query plans; and present an algorithm forcomputing such plans.,*,2004,1

Classification Rules for Semi-Structured Data.,David Michaeli; Werner Nutt; Yehoshua Sagiv,Semistructured data have recently become an important research topic in databases. So far;most research has concentrated on data models and query languages AQM+96; BDHS96;Abi97]. Interestingly; semistructured data models are based on a\world view" that is verysimilar to the one underlying Description Logics (DL's). A semistructured databaseessentially consists of objects; which are linked to each other by attributes. In this paper; wewant to exploit this similarity to apply reasoning techniques from description logics tosemistructured data. Semistructured models are intended to capture data that are notintentionally structured; that are structured heterogeneously; or that evolve so quickly thatthe changes cannot be re ected in the structure. A typical example is the World-Wide Webwith its HTML pages; text les; bibliographies etc. Another example are biological …,Description Logics,1997,1
Useful defaults in description logics,Werner Nutt; Peter F Patel-Schneider,Non-monotonic constructs have recently attracted considerable attention from researchers indescription logics (DLs).(Papers on the subject include Baader and Hollunder; 1992a];Baader and Hollunder; 1992b]; Padgham and Nebel; 1993]; Patel-Schneider; 1992]; andQuantz and Royer; 1992].) This attention has been in response to a generally-felt need forsimple nonmonotonic or default reasoning in many applications in which DLs can be useful.However; the proposed schemes have suffered from either lack of expressive power; orundesirable computational complexity. We undertook to develop a DL that incorporatesnonmonotonic reasoning with the following features that we feel make for a practical defaultextension to DLs. 1 The nonmonotonic features mesh well with the DL and are easy tounderstand. The entire logic makes sense from a syntactic and semantic point of view.,International Workshop on Description Logics,1994,1

Doctoral Advisor or Medical Condition: Towards Entity-Specific Rankings of Knowledge Base Properties,Simon Razniewski; Vevake Balaraman; Werner Nutt,Abstract In knowledge bases such as Wikidata; it is possible to assert a large set ofproperties for entities; ranging from generic ones such as name and place of birth to highlyprofession-specific or background-specific ones such as doctoral advisor or medicalcondition. Determining a preference or ranking in this large set is a challenge in tasks suchas prioritisation of edits or natural-language generation. Most previous approaches toranking knowledge base properties are purely data-driven; that is; as we show; mistakefrequency for interestingness. In this work; we have developed a human-annotated datasetof 350 preference judgments among pairs of knowledge base properties for fixed entities.From this set; we isolate a subset of pairs for which humans show a high level of agreement(87.5% on average).

Towards Approximating Incomplete Queries over Partially Complete Databases,Ognjen Savković; Evgeny Kharlamov; Werner Nutt; Pierre Senellart,Building reliable systems over partially complete data poses significant challenges becausequeries they send to the available data retrieve answers that may significantly differ from thereal answers. This may lead to a wrong understanding of the data and the events andprocesses it describes. This problem is especially critical for analytical systems thataggregate retrieved data since missing answers may significantly change results ofanalytical computations; eg; computation of minimal or average values is sensitive tomissing values. One way to ensure reliability of (analytical) systems over partially completedata is to guarantee that whatever data they touch is complete wrt to the real data.,AMW,2017,*
Mapping-equivalence and oid-equivalence of single-function object-creating conjunctive queries,Angela Bonifati; Werner Nutt; Riccardo Torlone; Jan Van den Bussche,Abstract Conjunctive database queries have been extended with a mechanism for objectcreation to capture important applications such as data exchange; data integration; andontology-based data access. Object creation generates new object identifiers in the resultthat do not belong to the set of constants in the source database. The new object identifierscan be also seen as Skolem terms. Hence; object-creating conjunctive queries can also beregarded as restricted second-order tuple-generating dependencies (SO-tgds); consideredin the data exchange literature. In this paper; we focus on the class of single-function object-creating conjunctive queries; or sifo CQs for short. The single-function symbol can be usedonly once in the head of the query. We give a new characterization for oid-equivalence ofsifo CQs that is simpler than the one given by Hull and Yoshikawa and places the …,The VLDB Journal,2016,*
Turning The Partial-closed World Assumption Upside Down,Simon Razniewski; Ognjen Savkovic; Werner Nutt,The partial-closed world setting provides an intermediate ground between open-world andclosed-world settings. Previous work on the partial-closed world assumption assumes thatincompleteness is the default; ie; that databases in general can be incomplete; and are onlydefinitely complete in specified parts. In this work we turn this assumption around; and studydatabases where completeness is the default; and incompleteness only occurs in specifiedparts. We present four languages for describing potentially incomplete parts of databases;full-table statements; patterns; local statements and query statements. We show that exceptfor full-table statements; it is not possible to translate between the two settings withoutextending the languages. Finally; we present techniques to decide query completenessentailment for each of the languages both on the schema and instance level; finding that …,*,2016,*
Adding completeness information to query answers over spatial databases,Simon Razniewski; Werner Nutt,Abstract Real-life spatial databases are inherently incomplete. This is in particular the casewhen data from different sources are combined. An extreme example are volunteeredgeographical information systems like OpenStreetMap. When querying such databases thequestion arises how reliable are the retrieved answers. For instance; for positive queries;which ask for existing patterns of objects; further answers could show up if the data iscompleted. For queries with negation; it is furthermore possible that after data completionobjects cease to satisfy a query.,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2014,*
Bridging the Semantic Gap between RDF and SPARQL using Completeness Statements [Extended Version],Fariz Darari; Simon Razniewski; Werner Nutt,Abstract: RDF data is often treated as incomplete; following the Open-World Assumption. Onthe other hand; SPARQL; the standard query language over RDF; usually follows the Closed-World Assumption; assuming RDF data to be complete. This gives rise to a semantic gapbetween RDF and SPARQL. In this paper; we address how to close the semantic gapbetween RDF and SPARQL in terms of certain answers and possible answers usingcompleteness statements.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1408.6395,2014,*

Databases under the Partial Closed-world Assumption: A Survey.,Simon Razniewski; Werner Nutt,ABSTRACT Databases are traditionally considered either under the closedworld or the open-world assumption. In some scenarios however a middle ground; the partial closed-worldassumption; is needed; which has received less attention so far. In this survey we reviewfoundational and work on the partial closed-world assumption and then discuss work donein our group in recent years on various aspects of reasoning over databases under thisassumption. We first discuss the conceptual foundations of this assumption. We then list themain decision problems and the known results. Finally; we discuss implementationalapproaches and extensions.,Grundlagen von Datenbanken,2014,*
Value Joins are Expensive over (Probabilistic) XML. Extended Version,Werner Nutt; Pierre Senellart,Abstract We address the cost of adding value joins to tree-pattern queries and monadicsecond-order queries over trees in terms of the tractability of query evaluation over two datamodels: XML and probabilistic XML. Our results show that the data complexity rises fromlinear; for joinfree queries; to intractable; for queries with value joins; while combinedcomplexity remains essentially the same. For tree-pattern queries with joins (TPJ) thecomplexity jump is only on probabilistic XML; while for monadic second-order logic overtrees with joins (TMSOJ) it already appears for deterministic XML documents. Moreover; forTPJ queries that have a single join; we show a dichotomy: every query is either essentiallyjoin-free; and in this case it is tractable over probabilistic XML; or it is intractable. In this lightwe study the problem of deciding whether a query with joins is essentially join-free. For …,*,2011,*

They sit between informationsources gained externally or through online transaction processing systems (OLTP); anddecision support or data mining queries following the vision of online analytic processing(OLAP). Three main arguments have been put forward in favor of this caching approach: 1.Performance and safety considerations: The concurrency control methods of most DBMSsdo not react well to a mix of short update transactions (as in OLTP) and OLAP queries thattypically search a large portion of the database. Moreover; the OLTP systems are oftencritical for the operation of the organization and must not be under danger of corruption ofother applications.,*,1999,*

Task acquisition with a description logic reasoner,Martin Buchheit; Hans-Jürgen Bürckert; Bernhard Hollunder; Armin Laux; Werner Nutt; Marek Wójcik,Abstract In many knowledge based systems the application domain is modeled in an object-centered formalism. Research in knowledge acquisition has given evidence that thisapproach allows one to adequately model the conceptual structures of human experts.However; when a novice user wants to describe a particular task to be solved by such asystem he has to be well acquainted with the underlying domain model; and therefore ischarged with the burden of making himself familiar with it. We aim at giving automatedsupport to a user in this process; which we call task acquisition. This paper describes theTacos system; which guides a user through an object-centered domain model and givessupport to him in specifying his task. A characteristic of Tacos is that the user can enter onlyinformation that is meaningful and consistent with the domain model.

Semantic Diagnostics of Smart Factories,Evgeny Kharlamov; Ognjen Savkovic; Martin Ringsquandl; Guohui Xiao; Gulnar Mehdi; Elem Güzel Kalayc; Werner Nutt; Mikhail Roshchin; Ian Horrocks; Thomas Runkler,Abstract. Smart factories are one of the biggest trends in modern manufacturing; also knownas Industry 4.0. They reach a new level of process automation and make heavy use ofsensors in manufactoring equipment; which brings new challenges to monitoring anddiagnostics at smart factories. We propose to address the challenges with a novel rule-based monitoring and diagnostics language that relies on ontologies and reasoning andallows one to write diagnostic tasks at a high level of abstraction. We show that ourapproach speeds up the diagnostic routine of engineers at Siemens: they can formulate anddeploy diagnostic tasks in factories faster than with existing Siemens data-driven solutions.Moreover we show that our diagnostic language; despite the built-in reasoning; allows forefficient execution of diagnostic tasks over large volumes of industrial data.

Modeling and Summarizing News Events Using Semantic Triples,Radityo Eko Prasojo; Mouna Kacimi; Werner Nutt,Abstract. Summarizing news articles is becoming crucial for allowing quick and conciseaccess to information about daily events. This task can be challenging when the same eventis reported with various levels of detail or is subject to diverse view points. A well establishedtechnique in the area of news summarization consists in modeling events as a set ofsemantic triples. These triples are weighted; mainly based on their frequencies; and thenfused to build summaries. Typically; triples are extracted from main clauses; which mightlead to information loss. Moreover; some crucial facets of news; such as reasons orconsequences; are mostly reported in subordinate clauses and thus they are not properlyhandled. In this paper; we focus on an existing work that uses a graph structure to modelsentences allowing the access to any triple independently from the clause it belongs to …,*,*,*

Algorithms for Rewriting Aggregate Queries Using Views,Werner Nutt,Abstract Typical queries over data warehouses perform aggregation. One of the main ideasto optimize the execution of an aggregate query is to reuse results of previously answeredqueries. This leads to the problem of rewriting aggregate queries using views. Moreprecisely; given a set of queries; called “views;” and a new query; the task is to reformulatethe new query with the help of the views in such a way that executing the reformulated queryover the views yields the same result as executing the original query over the base relations.Due to a lack of theory; so far algorithms for this problem were rather ad-hoc. They weresound; but were not proven to be complete.,*,*,*
Ensuring the Completeness and Soundness of SPARQL Queries Using Completeness Statements about RDF Data Sources,Fariz Darari; Werner Nutt; Simon Razniewski; Sebastian Rudolph,Abstract. RDF generally follows the open-world assumption: information is incomplete bydefault. Consequently; SPARQL queries cannot retrieve with certainty complete answers;and even worse; when they involve negation; it is unclear whether they produce soundanswers. Nevertheless; there is hope to lift this limitation. On many specific topics (eg;children of Trump; Apollo 11 crew; EU founders); RDF data sources contain completeinformation; a fact that can be made explicit through completeness statements. In this work;we leverage completeness statements to bridge the gap between RDF and SPARQL. Wefirst develop a technique to check query completeness based on RDF data withcompleteness information. For queries with negation; we approach the problem of querysoundness checking. We provide a formalization and characterize the soundness …,*,*,*
2. Conjunctive Queries,Evegenij Kharlamov; Werner Nutt,Throughout the exercise we refer to attributes of a relation according to the unnamedperspective.

A relationR consists of a relation schema; which in the unnamed perspective is given by the number ofattributes of R; denoted as arity (R); and an instance; which is a set of tuples of length arity(R). Algebra expressions are denoted as E; F. Also expression have an arity. If R1;...; Rm arethe relations occurring in E; then every instance of R1;...; Rm uniquely determines aninstance of E. We use the letters C or D to denote conditions used in selections and A or Bfor denoting ascending sequences of positive integers.

Franz Baader,Werner Nutt,Abstract This chapter provides an introduction to Description Logics as a formal language forrepresenting knowledge and reasoning about it. It first gives a short overview of the ideasunderlying Description Logics. Then it introduces syntax and semantics; covering the basicconstructors that are used in systems or have been introduced in the literature; and the waythese constructors can be used to build knowledge bases. Finally; it defines the typicalinference problems; shows how they are interrelated; and describes different approaches foreffectively solving these problems. Some of the topics that are only briefly mentioned in thischapter will be treated in more detail in subsequent chapters.,*,*,*

WINO-Logical Foundations of (Terminological) Knowledge Representation and Processing: Current and Future Research,Hans-Jürgen Bürckert; Franz Baader; Bernhard Hollunder; Armin Laux; Werner Nutt,The research aim of the WINO project was the investigation of logic-based knowledgerepresentation (KR) formalisms; and of suitable inferences for these formalisms. Until now;we have focused on terminological knowledge representation formalisms; so-calledterminological logics; which can be seen as descendants of the original system KL-ONE.When WINO started in May 1989; there already existed various implementations ofterminological KR systems; but their inference components were mainly based onincomplete algorithms; ie; on algorithms which could not deduce all the facts implied by theknowledge base.

Aggregating Probabilistic XML,Serge Abiteboul; T-H Hubert Chan; Evgeny Kharlamov; Werner Nutt; Pierre Senellart,Les sources d'incertitude et d'imprécision des données sont nombreuses. Une manière degérer cette incertitude est d'associer aux données des annotations probabilistes. Denombreux modèles de bases de données probabilistes ont ainsi été proposés; dans lescadres relationnel et semi-structuré. Ce dernier est particulièrement adapté à la gestion dedonnées incertaines provenant de traitement automatiques. Un important problème; dans lecadre des bases de données probabilistes XML; est celui des requêtes d'agrégation (count;sum; avg; etc.); qui n'a pas été étudié jusqu'à présent. Dans un modèle unifiant les différentsmodèles probabilistes semi-structurés étudiés à ce jour; nous présentons des algorithmespour calculer la distribution des résultats de l'agrégation (qui exploitent certaines propriétésde régularité des fonctions d'agrégation); ainsi que des moments (en particulier …,*,*,*

Combination Problems for Commutative/Monoidal Theories,Franz Baader; Werner Nutt,Abstract We study the class of theories for which solving uni cation problems is equivalent tosolving systems of linear equations over a semiring. It encompasses important examples likethe theories of Abelian monoids; idempotent Abelian monoids; and Abelian groups. Thisclass has been introduced by the authors independently of each other as\commutativetheories"(Baader) and\monoidal theories"(Nutt). We show that commutative theories andmonoidal theories indeed de ne the same class (modulo a translation of the signature); andwe prove that it is undecidable whether a given theory belongs to it. In the remainder of thepaper we investigate combinations of commutative/monoidal theories with other theories.We show that nitary commutative/monoidal theories always satisfy the requirements forapplying general methods developed for the combination of uni cation algorithms for …,*,*,*

Deciding Equivalences among Aggregate Queries,Sara Cohen; Werner Nutt; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract Equivalence of aggregate queries is investigated for the class of conjunctivequeries with comparisons and the aggregate operators count; count-distinct; min; max; andsum. Essentially; this class contains all unnested SQL queries with the above aggregateoperators; with a WHERE clause consisting of a conjunction of comparisons; and without aHAVING clause. The comparisons are either interpreted over a domain with a dense order(like the rationals) or with a discrete order (like the integers). Characterizations ofequivalence differ for the two cases. For queries with either max or min; equivalence ischaracterized in terms of dominance mappings; which can be viewed as a generalization ofcontainment mappings. For queries with the count-distinct operator; a sufficient condition forequivalence is given in terms of equivalence of conjunctive queries under set semantics …,*,*,*

R-£ MA: An Information Integration System for Grid Monitoring Andy Cooke1; Alasdair Gray1; Lisha Ma1; Werner Nutt1; James Magowan2; Paul Taylor2; Rob Byrom...,Manish Soni; Antony Wilson; Roney Cordenonsi; Linda Cornwall; Abdeslem Djaoui; Steve Fisher; Norbert Podhorszki; Brian Coghlan; Stuart Kenny; David O'Callaghan,Abstract. Grids are complex distributed systems that provide access to computationalresources in a transparent fashion. The task of collecting information about the state of theGrid itself and making it available to other Grid components for querying is called Gridmonitoring. We describe the architecture and the query processing mechanism of the R-GMA system (Relational Grid Monitoring Architecture); which is being developed as part ofthe European DataGrid project. We identify the specific requirements of this applicationdomain and explain how our system design responds to them. R-GMA allows arbitrary Gridcomponents to play the roles of producers or consumers of information by providingspecialised producer and consumer agents that support components in playing these roles.Information can have the form of static data sets or streams of data.

Organized by Franz Baader1; Martin Buchheit3; Manfred Jeusfeld2; and Werner Nutt3,Franz Baader; Martin Buchheit; Manfred Jeusfeld; Werner Nutt,Object-centered formalisms for domain modeling play an important role both in knowledgerepresentation (KR) and in the database (DB) area. Nevertheless; there has been little cross-fertilization between the two areas. Research in databases was mostly concerned withhandling large amounts of data that are represented in a rather inexpressive formalism;whereas KR concentrated on intensional inferences in relatively small knowledge bases.However; many of today's problems demand sophisticated reasoning on complex and large-scale objects. The workshop is intended to bring together researchers from both areas tocontinue the discussion about the problems and applications of a combination of KR and DBtechniques; which was initiated at the predecessor workshop KRDB-94; and to identify newsuch questions and solutions. For the following (non-exclusive) list of questions; such a …,*,*,*
