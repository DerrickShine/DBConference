Clam's Shell Inspired High‐Energy Inorganic Coatings with Underwater Low Adhesive Superoleophobicity,Xueli Liu; Jie Zhou; Zhongxin Xue; Jun Gao; Jingxin Meng; Shutao Wang; Lei Jiang,Superoleophobic surfaces have attracted great attention for their potential applications inareas such as anti-bioadhesion;[1] industrial metal cleaning;[2] oil/water separation;[3] anddroplet manipulation in microfludics.[4] By combining fluorinated low-surface-energychemicals with micro/nano-hierarchical structures; many excellent superoleophobic surfaceshave been fabricated.[5] However; the superoleophobicity of these surfaces can be onlymaintained in air. The existence of water generally deprives these traditional low-enengysurfaces of their superoleophobicity;[6] thus resulting in the loss of function in areas such asoil repellence of marine equipment and oil-spill cleanup. Studying the special wettabilityphenomena in nature has become an important way for scientific research to help designfunctional interfacial materials.[7] Recently; the discovery of underwater selfcleaning fish …,Advanced Materials,2012,128
Superoleophobic surfaces with controllable oil adhesion and their application in oil transportation,Xi Yao; Jun Gao; Yanlin Song; Lei Jiang,Abstract Controlling liquid adhesion is a fundamental issue in many applications for specialwettable surfaces. Compared to superhydrophobic surfaces of different water adhesion;superoleophobic surfaces of controllable oil adhesion are much more practical; as it leads tonon-wetting for both water and oil. However; previously the investigation for oil adhesionability on superoleophobic surfaces in oil/air/solid system has been extremely rare. In thiswork; we describe a convenient approach to fabricate superoleophobic surfaces throughperfluorothiolate reaction on Cu (OH) 2 nanostructure surfaces and investigate their possibleapplication in oil droplet transportation. The prepared surfaces exhibit controllable oiladhesive force depending on surface nanostructures or external preloads on the oil droplet.A model of the penetrating Cassie state is used to help analyze the unique phenomena …,Advanced Functional Materials,2011,117

Tip geometry controls adhesive states of superhydrophobic surfaces,Zhongjun Cheng; Jun Gao; Lei Jiang,Inspired by biological attachment systems; aligned polystyrene (PS) nanopillars terminatingin flat; concave tips and nanotubes were fabricated by a simple and reproducible method. Allthe obtained surfaces show both the contact angles larger than 150°(superhydrophobicity)and high adhesion of water to it. The tip geometry plays an important role in determining theadhesive property. Surface with the concave tips has the highest adhesion; and then thesurface with flat tips; whereas aligned nanotube surface has a relatively lower adhesion.Besides different van der Waals forces between the PS surfaces and water; anotherimportant factor; ie; different negative pressures produced by the different volumes of sealedair; may be the crucial factor for their different adhesions. These findings provide theexperimental evidence of the influence of the tip geometry on the adhesion of structured …,Langmuir,2010,71
Bioinspired oil strider floating at the oil/water interface supported by huge superoleophobic force,Xueli Liu; Jun Gao; Zhongxin Xue; Li Chen; Ling Lin; Lei Jiang; Shutao Wang,Oil pollution to aquatic devices; especially to those oil-cleaning devices and equipment-repairing robots during oil spill accidents; has drawn great attention and remains an urgentproblem to be resolved. Developing devices that can move freely in an oil/water systemwithout contamination from oil has both scientific and practical importance. In nature; theinsect water strider can float on water by utilizing the superhydrophobic supporting forcereceived by its legs.

The fabricated nanopores are geometrically asymmetric; like an invertedquadrangular frustum pyramid. The nanopore geometry can be engineered by finely tuningthe mechanical load on the AFM tip and the scanning area. Particularly noteworthy is thatthe nanopores can also be fabricated in suspended few-layer mica membranes on a siliconwindow; and may find potential use as functional components in nanofluidic devices.,Nano research,2012,27

Lyophilic Nonwettable Surface Based on an Oil/Water/Air/Solid Four‐Phase System,Jun Gao; Xi Yao; Yong Zhao; Lei Jiang,Jun Gao; Xi Yao; Yong Zhao;* and Lei Jiang* air/solid or oil/water/solid) model. In the triple-phase system; lyophilicity and a Cassie state cannot coexist and their combination hasnever been realized.[9] In recent years; superlyorepellent surfaces such as a fluoro-modifiedpolyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane surface were actively studied owing to their superiorlyorepellency over superhydrophobic surfaces.[10] However; the current recognition ofsuper-lyorepellent surfaces is also still confined to the triple-phase system. Here we preparea lyorepellent surface that exhibits a unique lyophilic Cassie state in an oil/water/air/solidsystem. In practical terms; the oil shows a contact angle of less than 90 but cannot wet thedesigned surface under water. A super-lyorepellent surface was prepared by growing re-entrant structured [10a] trichloromethylsilane nanofilaments on a glass slide and …,Small,2013,12
Contact angle hysteresis and oil film lubrication in electrowetting with two immiscible liquids,Jun Gao; Niels Mendel; Ranabir Dey; Davood Baratian; Frieder Mugele,Abstract: Electrowetting (EW) of water drops in ambient oil has found a wide range ofapplications including lab-on-a-chip devices; display screens; and variable focus lenses.The efficacy of all these applications is dependent on the contact angle hysteresis (CAH);which is generally reduced in the presence of ambient oil due to thin lubrication layers.While it is well-known that AC voltage reduces the effective contact angle hysteresis (CAH)for EW in ambient air; we demonstrate here that CAH for EW in ambient oil increases withincreasing AC and DC voltage. Taking into account the disjoining pressure of thefluoropolymer-oil-water system; viscous oil entrainment and electrostatic stresses; we findthat this observation can be explained by progressive thinning with increasing voltage of theoil layer underneath the drop. This exposes the droplet to the roughness of the underlying …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.02712,2018,*
Kirigami Nanofluidics,Jun Gao; Andrew Koltonow; Kalyan Raidongia; Bernard Berckerman; Niels Boon; Erik Luijten; Monica Olvera de la Cruz; Jiaxing Huang,Exfoliated thin sheets of layered materials can readily reassemble to form a macroscopiclamellar film containing a massive array of parallel two-dimensional (2D) nanochannels.These 2D nanofluidic channels exhibit enhanced unipolar ionic conductivity with thecounterions as the majority charge carriers; thus conceptually become an ionic analogue ofextrinsically doped semiconductor wafers. Here we demonstrate “kirigami nanofluidics”;where ionic transport can be manipulated by tailor-cutting the shape of the film. Shapes withasymmetric source and drain exhibit rectifying ionic currents; which is attributed to theasymmetric concentration polarization zones developed in the two reservoirs. Therefore; therectification ratio can be continuously tuned simply by adjusting the relative edge sizes of theshape; or even programmed by selecting the number of source and drain branches in …,Materials Chemistry Frontiers,2017,*
