Protecting privacy against location-based personal identification,Claudio Bettini; X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract This paper presents a preliminary investigation on the privacy issues involved in theuse of location-based services. It is argued that even if the user identity is not explicitlyreleased to the service provider; the geo-localized history of user-requests can act as aquasi-identifier and may be used to access sensitive information about specific individuals.The paper formally defines a framework to evaluate the risk in revealing a user identity vialocation information and presents preliminary ideas about algorithms to prevent this tohappen.,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2005,392

Discovering calendar-based temporal association rules,Yingjiu Li; Peng Ning; X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract We study the problem of mining association rules and related time intervals; wherean association rule holds either in all or some of the intervals. To restrict to meaningful timeintervals; we use calendar schemas and their calendar-based patterns. A calendar schemaexample is (year; month; day) and a calendar-based pattern within the schema is (∗; 3; 15);which represents the set of time intervals each corresponding to the 15th day of a March.Our focus is finding efficient algorithms for this mining problem by extending the well-knownApriori algorithm with effective pruning techniques. We evaluate our techniques viaexperiments.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2003,329
Appintent: Analyzing sensitive data transmission in android for privacy leakage detection,Zhemin Yang; Min Yang; Yuan Zhang; Guofei Gu; Peng Ning; X Sean Wang,Abstract Android phones often carry personal information; attracting malicious developers toembed code in Android applications to steal sensitive data. With known techniques in theliterature; one may easily determine if sensitive data is being transmitted out of an Androidphone. However; transmission of sensitive data in itself does not necessarily indicate privacyleakage; a better indicator may be whether the transmission is by user intention or not. Whentransmission is not intended by the user; it is more likely a privacy leakage. The problem ishow to determine if transmission is user intended. As a first solution in this space; we presenta new analysis framework called AppIntent. For each data transmission; AppIntent canefficiently provide a sequence of GUI manipulations corresponding to the sequence ofevents that lead to the data transmission; thus helping an analyst to determine if the data …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGSAC conference on Computer & communications security,2013,281
A data model for supporting on-line analytical processing,Chang Li; X Sean Wang,Abstract A databaseapplication; called “on-line analytical processing”(or OLAP) andaimedatproviding businessintelligence through on-line multidimensional data analysis;hasbecome increasingly important due to the existence of huge amounts of on-line data.This paper formalizes a multidimensional data (MDD) model for OLAP; and develops analgebraic query language called grouping algebra. The basic component of the MDD modelis a multidimensional cube; consisting of a number of relations (called dimensions) and foreach combination of tuples (called a coordinate); one from each dimension; there is anassociated data value. Each dimension is viewed as a basic grouping; ie; each tuple in thedimension comesponds to the group consisting of all the coordinates that contain this tuple.In order to express user queries; relational algebra expressions are then extended to …,Proceedings of the fifth international conference on Information and knowledge management,1996,260

Discovering frequent event patterns with multiple granularities in time sequences,Claudio Bettini; Xiaoyang Sean  Wang; Sushil Jajodia; J-L Lin,An important usage of time sequences is to discover temporal patterns. The discoveryprocess usually starts with a user specified skeleton; called an event structure; whichconsists of a number of variables representing events and temporal constraints among thesevariables; the goal of the discovery is to find temporal patterns; ie; instantiations of thevariables in the structure that appear frequently in the time sequence. The paper introducesevent structures that have temporal constraints with multiple granularities; defines thepattern discovery problem with these structures; and studies effective algorithms to solve it.The basic components of the algorithms include timed automata with granularities (TAGs)and a number of heuristics. The TAGs are for testing whether a specific temporal pattern;called a candidate complex event type; appears frequently in a time sequence.

Logical design for temporal databases with multiple granularities,X Sean Wang; Claudio Bettini; Alexander Brodsky; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract The purpose of good database logical design is to eliminate data redundancy andisertion and deletion anomalies. In order to achieve this objective for temporal databases;the notions of temporal types; which formalize time granularities; and temporal functionaldependencies (TFDs) are intrduced. A temporal type is a monotonic mapping from ticks oftime (represented by positive integers) to time sets (represented by subsets of reals) and isused to capture various standard and user-defined calendars. A TFD is a proper extensionof the traditional functional dependency and takes the form X→ m Y; meaning that there is aunique value for Y during one tick of the temporal type &mgr; for one particular X value. Anaxiomatization for TFDs is given. Because a finite set TFDs usually implies an infinitenumber of TFDs; we introduce the notion of and give an axiomatization for a finite closure …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1997,182
Mining temporal relationships with multiple granularities in time sequences,Claudio Bettini; Xiaoyang Sean  Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Discovering sequential relationships in a time sequence is often important to manyapplication domains; including financial; manufacturing; etc. Indeed; a lot of work has beendone in this area (see [1; 6] for an overview). An important aspect for such a discoveryprocess is; however; largely missing from the literature: namely discovering temporalpatterns or relationships that involve multiple time granularities. This paper reports theprogress in this front. A more detailed study can be found in [4]. In this paper; we focus onalgorithms for discovering sequential relationships when a rough pattern of relationships isgiven. The rough pattern (which we term “event structure”) specifies what sort ofrelationships a user is interested in. For example; a user may be interested in “which pairs ofevents occur frequently one week after another”. The algorithms will find the instances …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,1998,154
Checking for k-anonymity violation by views,Chao Yao; X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract When a private relational table is published using views; secrecy or privacy may beviolated. This paper uses a formally-defined notion of k-anonymity to measure disclosure byviews; where k> 1 is a positive integer. Intuitively; violation of k-anonymity occurs when aparticular attribute value of an entity can be determined to be among less than k possibilitiesby using the views together with the schema information of the private table. The papershows that; in general; whether a set of views violates k-anonymity is a computationally hardproblem. Subcases are identified and their computational complexities discussed.Especially interesting are those subcases that yield polynomial checking algorithms (in thenumber of tuples in the views). The paper also provides an efficient conservative algorithmthat checks for necessary conditions for k-anonymity violation.,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,131
Abstraction-based intrusion detection in distributed environments,Peng Ning; Sushil Jajodia; Xiaoyang Sean Wang,Abstract Abstraction is an important issue in intrusion detection; since it not only hides thedifference between heterogeneous systems; but also allows generic intrusion-detectionmodels. However; abstraction is an error-prone process and is not well supported in currentintrusion-detection systems (IDSs). This article presents a hierarchical model to supportattack specification and event abstraction in distributed intrusion detection. The modelinvolves three concepts: system view; signature; and view definition. A system view providesan abstract interface of a particular type of information; defined on the instances of systemviews; a signature specifies certain distributed attacks or events to be monitored; a viewdefinition is then used to derive information from the matches of a signature and presents itthrough a system view. With the three elements; the model provides a hierarchical …,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),2001,129
Privacy in geo-social networks: proximity notification with untrusted service providers and curious buddies,Sergio Mascetti; Dario Freni; Claudio Bettini; X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract A major feature of the emerging geo-social networks is the ability to notify a userwhen any of his friends (also called buddies) happens to be geographically in proximity.This proximity service is usually offered by the network itself or by a third party serviceprovider (SP) using location data acquired from the users. This paper provides a rigoroustheoretical and experimental analysis of the existing solutions for the location privacyproblem in proximity services. This is a serious problem for users who do not trust the SP tohandle their location data and would only like to release their location information in ageneralized form to participating buddies. The paper presents two new protocols providingcomplete privacy with respect to the SP and controllable privacy with respect to the buddies.The analytical and experimental analysis of the protocols takes into account privacy …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2011,127
Provisions and obligations in policy management and security applications,Claudio Bettini; Sushil Jajodia; X Sean Wang; Duminda Wijesekera,This chapter illustrates that policy management; in a complex system; calls for more dynamicmechanisms like provisions and obligations. Policies are widely used in many systems andapplications. Recently; it has been recognized that a “yes/no” response to every scenario isjust not enough for many modern systems and applications. Many policies require certainconditions to be satisfied and actions to be performed before; or after; a decision is made. Ina computer system; policies provide the basis for the design of its underlying controlmechanisms. An access control policy defines what information users are authorized to reador modify. Most research on policies; however; has been on traditional static policies whereuser requests are only evaluated based on the currently available information and only“yes/no” decisions are made.

A general framework for time granularity and its application to temporal reasoning,Claudio Bettini; X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract This paper presents a general framework to define time granularity systems. Weidentify the main dimensions along which different systems can be characterized; andinvestigate the formal relationships among granularities in these systems. The paper alsointroduces the notion of a network of temporal constraints with (multiple) granularitiesemphasizing the semantic and computational differences from constraint networks with asingle granularity. Consistency of networks with multiple granularities is shown to beNP‐hard in general and approximate solutions for this problem and for the minimal networkproblem are proposed.,Annals of mathematics and artificial intelligence,1998,125
Temporal reasoning in workflow systems,Claudio Bettini; X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract In a workflow system; autonomous agents perform various activities cooperatively tocomplete a common task. Successful completion of the task often depends on correctsynchronization and scheduling of agents' activities. It would greatly enhance thecapabilities of current workflow systems if quantitative temporal constraints on the duration ofactivities and their synchronization requirements can be specified and reasoned about. Thispaper investigates such requirements and related reasoning algorithms. In particular; thepaper studies the consistency; prediction and enactment services in a workflow system; andprovides corresponding algorithms. The consistency service is to ensure that thespecification of the temporal constraints is possible to satisfy; the prediction service is toforetell the time frame for the involved activities; and the enactment service is to schedule …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2002,120
Continually evaluating similarity-based pattern queries on a streaming time series,Like Gao; X Sean Wang,Abstract In many applications; local or remote sensors send in streams of data; and thesystem needs to monitor the streams to discover relevant events/patterns and deliver instantreaction correspondingly. An important scenario is that the incoming stream is a continuallyappended time series; and the patterns are time series in a database. At each time when anew value arrives (called a time position); the system needs to find; from the database; thenearest or near neighbors of the incoming time series up to the time position. This paperattacks the problem by using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to efficiently find the crosscorrelations of time series; which yields; in a batch mode; the nearest and near neighbors ofthe incoming time series at many time positions. To take advantage of this batch processingin achieving fast response time; this paper uses prediction methods to predict future …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,115
Supporting content-based searches on time series via approximation,Changzhou Wang; X Sean Wang,Fast retrieval of time series in terms of their contents is important in many applicationdomains. This paper studies database techniques supporting fast searches for time serieswhose contents are similar to what users specify. The content types studied include shapes;trends; cyclic components; autocorrelation functions and partial autocorrelation functions.Due to the complex nature of the similarity searches involving such contents; traditionaldatabase techniques usually cannot provide a fast response when the involved data volumeis high. This paper proposes to answer such content-based queries using appropriateapproximation techniques. The paper then introduces two specific approximation methods;one is wavelet based and the other line-fitting based. Finally; the paper reports someexperiments conducted on a stock price data set as well as a synthesized random walk …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2000.

An algebraic representation of calendars,Peng Ning; Xiaoyang Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract This paper uses an algebraic approach to define temporal granularities andcalendars. All the granularities in a calendar are expressed as algebraic expressions basedon a single “bottom” granularity. The operations used in the algebra directly reflect the wayswith which people construct new granularities from existing ones; and hence yield morenatural and compact granularities definitions. Calendar is formalized on the basis of thealgebraic operations; and properties of calendars are studied. As a step towards practicalapplications; the paper also presents algorithms for granule conversions betweengranularities in a calendar.,Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence,2002,105
Anonymity in location-based services: Towards a general framework,Claudio Bettini; Sergio Mascetti; X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,A general consensus is that the proliferation of location-aware devices will result in adiffusion of location-based services. Privacy preservation is a challenging research issue forthis kind of service. A possible solution consists of ensuring users' anonymity; ie; ensuringthat the user issuing a request is indistinguishable; among a group of users; by any attackerwho has access to the service requests. In this paper we propose a formal framework tomodel the problem of guaranteeing anonymity when requiring location-based services. Theproposed framework extends existing approaches by allowing to model different kinds ofknowledge that may be available to the attacker. We show application examples of ourframework; modeling both known scenarios and new ones. From a practical point of view;the framework makes it possible to define anonymity-preserving techniques that best …,Mobile Data Management; 2007 International Conference on,2007,96
Testing complex temporal relationships involving multiple granularities and its application to data mining,Claudio Bettini; X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract An important usage of time sequences is for dkcovering temporal patterns of events(a special type of data mining). This process usually starts with the specification by the userof an event structure which consists of a number of variables representing events andtemporal constraints among these variables. The goal of the data mining is to find temporalpatterns; ie; instantiations of the variables in the structure; which frequently appear in thetime sequence. This paper introduces event structures that have temporal constraints withmultiple granularities(TCGS). Testing the consistency of such structures is shown to be NP-hard. An approximate algorithm is then presented. The paper also introduces the concept ofa timed automaton with granularities(TAGs) that can be used to find in a time sequenceoccurrences of a particular TCG with instantiated variables.

Privacy-aware proximity based services,Sergio Mascetti; Claudio Bettini; Dario Freni; X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Proximity based services are location based services (LBS) in which the service adaptationdepends on the comparison between a given threshold value and the distance between auser and other (possibly moving) entities. While privacy preservation in LBS has latelyreceived much attention; very limited work has been done on privacy-aware proximity basedservices. This paper describes the main privacy threats that the usage of these services canlead to; and proposes original privacy preservation techniques offering different trade-offsbetween quality of service and privacy preservation. The properties of the proposedalgorithms are formally proved; and an extensive experimental work illustrates thepracticality of the approach.,Mobile Data Management: Systems; Services and Middleware; 2009.

Authorization in trust management: Features and foundations,Peter C Chapin; Christian Skalka; X Sean Wang,Abstract Trust management systems are frameworks for authorization in modern distributedsystems; allowing remotely accessible resources to be protected by providers.

In this paper we survey modernstate-of-the-art in trust management authorization; focusing on features of policy and rightslanguages that provide the necessary expressiveness for modern practice.

Abstraction-based misuse detection: High-level specifications and adaptable strategies,Jia-Ling Lin; X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,A typical misuse detection system contains:(1) a language for describing known techniques(called misuse signatures) used by attackers to penetrate the target system; and (2)monitoring programs for detecting the presence of an attack based on the given misusesignatures. In most of the systems appearing in the literature; however; the description ofmisuses is often in terms of a low level language (ie in terms of audit records of the targetsystem); that either has limited expressiveness or is difficult to use. Moreover the monitoringalgorithms are often fixed and do not adapt to a changing operating environment or toobjectives of the site security officer. To overcome these limitations; the paper defines a highlevel language for abstract misuse signatures (MuSigs). Due to the use of high levelconcepts; a MuSig can represent misuses in a simple form and yet with high …,Computer Security Foundations Workshop; 1998. Proceedings. 11th IEEE,1998,80
Supporting fast search in time series for movement patterns in multiple scales,Yunyao Qu; Changzhou Wang; X Sean Wang,Abstract An important investigation of time series involves search-ing for “movement”patterns; such as “going up” or “going down” or some combinations of them. Movementpatterns can be in various scales: a large scale pattern may cover a long time period; while asmall scale pattern usually covers a short time period. This paper considers such scalerequire-ment. More speciﬁcally; a pattern is deﬁned as a regular expression of letters; whereeach letter describes a move-ment direction and covers a speciﬁed length of time (calledpattern unit length). To ﬁnd if a time series (or a part of it) matches a pattern; the time seriesis ﬁrst partitioned into consecutive sub—series of the unit length; and for each subseries; thedirection of its best ﬁtting line is taken as the movement direction of the sub-series if thedistance between the best ﬁtting line and the sub-series is within a specified tolerance …,Proceedings of the seventh international conference on Information and knowledge management,1998,77
Solving multi-granularity temporal constraint networks,Claudio Bettini; X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract Many problems in scheduling; planning; and natural language understanding havebeen formulated in terms of temporal constraint satisfaction problems (TCSP). Theseproblems have been extensively investigated in the AI literature providing effective solutionsfor some fragments of the general model. Independently; there has been an effort in the dataand knowledge management research community for the formalization of the concept of timegranularity and for its applications. This paper considers a framework for integrating thenotion of time granularity into TCSP; and investigates the problems of consistency andnetwork solution; which; in this context; involve complex manipulation of the periodic setsrepresenting time granularities.

Moving Target Defense II: Application of Game Theory and Adversarial Modeling,Sushil Jajodia; Anup K Ghosh; VS Subrahmanian; Vipin Swarup; Cliff Wang; X Sean Wang,One of the most vexing problems in defending against computer intrusions is the seeminglyendless supply of exploitable software bugs that exist despite significant progress in securesoftware development practices. At least once a month (eg; on Patch Tuesday); majorsoftware vendors publish patches that fix the vulnerabilities in their deployed software codebase that have been discovered. These patches are often published after the vulnerabilitiesare known and have been exploited; in some cases for months and years. In currentlydeployed systems; the attacker has a static target to study and find vulnerabilities; and then awindow of exposure to exploit the vulnerability to gain privileged access on other people'smachines and networks; until the exploit is noticed; vulnerability found; patch released; andthen applied widely.

CARDS: A distributed system for detecting coordinated attacks,Jiahai Yang; Peng Ning; X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract A major research problem in intrusion detection is the efficient Detection ofcoordinated attacks over large networks. Issues to be resolved include determining whatdata should be collected; which portion of the data should be analyzed; where the analysisof the data should take place; and how to correlate multi-source information. This paperproposes the architecture of a Coordinated Attack Response and Detection System(CARDS). CARDS uses a signature-based model for resolving these issues. It consists ofsignature managers; monitors; and directory services. The system collects data in a flexible;distributed manner; and the detection process is decentralized among various monitors andis event-driven.

Temporal modules: An approach toward federated temporal databases,X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia; VS Subrahmanian,Abstract In a federated database environment; different constituents of the federation mayuse different temporal models or physical representations for temporal information. Thispaper introduces a new concept; called a temporal module; to resolve these differences; ormismatches; among the constituents. Intuitively; a temporal module hides theimplementation details of a temporal relation by exposing its information only through twowindowing functions: The first function associates each time point with a set of tuples and thesecond function links each tuple to a set of time points. A calculus-style language is given toform queries on temporal modules.

Provisions and obligations in policy rule management,Claudio Bettini; Sushil Jajodia; X Sean Wang; Duminda Wijesekera,Abstract Policies in modern systems and applications play an essential role. We argue thatdecisions based on policy rules should take into account the possibility for the users toenable specific policy rules; by performing actions at the time when decisions are beingrendered; and/or by promising to perform other actions in the future. Decisions should alsoconsider preferences among different sets of actions enabling different rules. We adopt aformalism and mechanism devised for policy rule management in this context; andinvestigate in detail the notion of obligations; which are those actions users promise toperform in the future upon firing of a specific policy rule. We also investigate how obligationscan be monitored and how the policy rules should be affected when obligations are eitherfulfilled or defaulted.,Journal of Network and Systems Management,2003,66
Large scale real-time ridesharing with service guarantee on road networks,Yan Huang; Favyen Bastani; Ruoming Jin; Xiaoyang Sean Wang,Abstract Urban traffic gridlock is a familiar scene. At the same time; the mean occupancy rateof personal vehicle trips in the United States is only 1.6 persons per vehicle mile.Ridesharing has the potential to solve many environmental; congestion; pollution; andenergy problems. In this paper; we introduce the problem of large scale real-timeridesharing with service guarantee on road networks. Trip requests are dynamicallymatched to vehicles while trip waiting and service time constraints are satisfied. We firstpropose two scheduling algorithms: a branch-and-bound algorithm and an integerprograming algorithm. However; these algorithms do not adapt well to the dynamic nature ofthe ridesharing problem. Thus; we propose kinetic tree algorithms which are better suited toefficient scheduling of dynamic requests and adjust routes on-the-fly. We perform …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,62
Privacy in location-based applications: research issues and emerging trends,Claudio Bettini; Sushil Jajodia; Pierangela Samarati; Sean X Wang,Location-based applications refer to those that use location data in a prominent manner.Location data can be very effective for service provisioning; enabling the birth of a newgeneration of information services. Although data security and privacy issues have beenextensively investigated in several domains; current techniques are not readily applicable tolocation-based applications. Conciliating the effectiveness of these applications with privacyconcerns constitutes a unique challenge; mostly due to the semantic richness of locationand time information. Research in this field involves aspects of spatio-temporal reasoning;query processing; system security; statistical inference; and more importantly; anonymizationtechniques. Several research groups have been working in recent years to identify privacyattacks and defense techniques in this domain. This state-of-the-art survey provides a …,*,2009,56
Aggregation in sensor networks with a user-provided quality of service goal,Zhen He; Byung Suk Lee; X Sean Wang,Abstract Significant research has been devoted to aggregation in sensor networks with thepurpose of optimizing its performance. Existing research has mostly concentrated onmaximizing network lifetime within a user-given error bound. In general; the greater the errorbound; the longer the lifetime. However; in some situations; it may not be realistic for theuser to provide an error bound. Instead; the user may want to provide a quality of service(QoS) goal that has a combined objective of lifetime and error. Indeed; the error tolerable bythe user may depend on how long the sensor network can last. This paper presents anaggregation protocol and related algorithms for reaching such a QoS goal. The key idea is toperiodically modify a filter threshold for each sensor in a way that is optimal within the userobjective; the key technical method being to translate the problem into a mathematical …,Information Sciences,2008,56
Pattern matching by Rs-operations: towards a unified approach to querying sequenced data,Seymour Ginsburg; Xiaoyang Wang,Abstract A family of sequence operations (rs-operations); based on pattern matching andincluding most of the “natural” operations on sequences; is introduced. In order to apply rs-operations to calculus-like query languages; a logic about sequences (SL) is defined byconverting rs-operations to special predicates. To illustrate the applicability of our conceptsto database queries; rs-operations and SL are used in an algebra and a calculus;respectively; over an extended relational data model containing sequences.,Proceedings of the eleventh ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1992,55

Temporal semantic assumptions and their use in databases,Claudio Bettini; Xiaoyang Sean  Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Data explicitly stored in a temporal database are often associated with certain semanticassumptions. Each assumption can be viewed as a way of deriving implicit information fromexplicitly stored data. Rather than leaving the task of deriving (possibly infinite) implicit datato application programs; as is the case currently; it is desirable that this be handled by thedatabase management system. To achieve this; the paper formalizes and studies two typesof semantic assumptions: point based and interval based. The point based assumptionsinclude those assumptions that use interpolation methods over values at different timeinstants; while the interval based assumptions include those that involve the conversion ofvalues across different time granularities. The paper presents techniques on:(1) howassumptions on specific sets of attributes can be automatically derived from the …,Knowledge and Data Engineering; IEEE Transactions on,1998,48

Anonymity and historical-anonymity in location-based services,Claudio Bettini; Sergio Mascetti; X Wang; Dario Freni; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract The problem of protecting user's privacy in Location-Based Services (LBS) hasbeen extensively studied recently and several defense techniques have been proposed. Inthis contribution; we first present a categorization of privacy attacks and related defenses.Then; we consider the class of defense techniques that aim at providing privacy throughanonymity and in particular algorithms achieving “historical k-anonymity” in the case of theadversary obtaining a trace of requests recognized as being issued by the same(anonymous) user. Finally; we investigate the issues involved in the experimental evaluationof anonymity based defense techniques; we show that user movement simulations based onmostly random movements can lead to overestimate the privacy protection in some casesand to overprotective techniques in other cases. The above results are obtained by …,Privacy in Location-Based Applications,2009,44
In-device spatial cloaking for mobile user privacy assisted by the cloud,Song Wang; X Sean Wang,Spatial cloaking has been proposed and studied to protect mobile user privacy when usinglocation based services (LBS). Traditional spatial cloaking methods are carried out by atrusted proxy known as location trusted server (LTS) to generate a region that contains atleast k users for every request. The LTS is assumed to know the location of all users at alltimes; and perform the cloaking for all user requests. There are a number of disadvantagesof relying on a single service for privacy preservation; including the scalability concern andthe appropriate worry that this service “knows too much”. To ameliorate this single-serviceproblem; in-device spatial cloaking may be more desirable. However; the sticky problem isthat the device does not know; at the time of the request; the locations of all other users;which are necessary to obtain an appropriate cloaked region. With cloud services; it may …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2010 Eleventh International Conference on,2010,42
Discovering temporal patterns in multiple granularities,Yingjiu Li; X Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract Many events repeat themselves as the time goes by. For example; an institute paysits employees on the first day of every month. However; events may not repeat with aconstant span of time. In the payday example here; the span of time between each twoconsecutive paydays ranges between 28 and 31 days. As a result; regularity; or temporalpattern; has to be captured with a use of granularities (such as day; week; month; and year);oftentimes multiple granularities. This paper defines the above patterns; and proposes anumber of pattern discovery algorithms. To focus on the basics; the paper assumes that a listof events with their timestamps is given; and the algorithms try to find patterns for the events.All of the algorithms repeat two possibly interleaving steps; with the first step generatingpossible (called candidate) patterns; and the second step verifying if candidate patterns …,Temporal; Spatial; and Spatio-Temporal Data Mining,2001,39
Location-aware key predistribution scheme for wide area wireless sensor networks,Katerina Simonova; Alan CH Ling; X Sean Wang,Abstract Key predistribution in wireless sensor networks refers to the problem of distributingsecret keys among sensors prior to deployment. Solutions appeared in the literature can beclassified into two categories: basic schemes that achieve fixed probability of sharing a keybetween any pair of sensors in a network and location-aware schemes that use a prioriknowledge about sensors' communication needs; such as location information; to guaranteeconnectivity only among sensors that need to and can talk. Location-aware schemesachieve performance enhancement over the basic schemes by using resources efficiently.However; existing location-aware solutions are not compatible with combinatorial methodsthat use a set of key groups to generate sensors' key rings. Combinatorial methods areappealing as they achieve deterministic performance close to optimal. Besides; existing …,Proceedings of the fourth ACM workshop on Security of ad hoc and sensor networks,2006,37
Auditing interval-based inference,Yingjiu Li; Lingyu Wang; X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract In this paper we study the feasibility of auditing interval-based inference. Sensitiveinformation about individuals is said to be compromised if an accurate enough interval;called inference interval; is obtained into which the value of the sensitive information mustfall. Compared with auditing exact inference that is traditionally studied; auditing interval-based inference is more complicated. Existing auditing methods such as audit expert do notapply to this case. Our result shows that it is intractable to audit interval-based inference forbounded integer values; while for bounded real values; the auditing problem is polynomialyet involves complicated computation of mathematical programming. To further examine thepracticability of auditing interval-based inference; we classify various auditing methods intothree categories: exact auditing; optimistic auditing; and pessimistic auditing. We analyze …,International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering,2002,37
ProvidentHider: an algorithm to preserve historical k-anonymity in lbs,Sergio Mascetti; Claudio Bettini; X Sean Wang; Dario Freni; Sushil Jajodia,One of the privacy threats recognized in the use of LBS is represented by an adversaryhaving information about the presence of individuals in certain locations; and using thisinformation together with an (anonymous) LBS request to re-identify the issuer of the requestassociating her to the requested service. Several papers have proposed techniques toprevent this; assuming that the use of the service is considered sensitive. In this paper weinvestigate the more general case in which the adversary is also able to recognize traces ofLBS requests by the same anonymous user; so that the identification of the issuer of onerequest can lead to the disclosure of the same user being in other possibly sensitivelocations at different times or using sensitive services. Using the notion of``historical k-anonymity''; this paper provides the first formalization of this class of privacy threats …,Mobile Data Management: Systems; Services and Middleware; 2009. MDM'09.

Decision-guidance management systems (DGMS): Seamless integration of data acquisition; learning; prediction and optimization,Alexander Brodsky; X Sean Wang,A decision guidance management system (DGMS) is a productivity platform for fastdevelopment of applications that require a closed-loop data acquisition; learning; prediction;and decision optimization. This paper introduces the DGMS concept; and the first DGMSdata model with its query language; DG-SQL. The DGMS data model is an extension of therelational model with probability distributions over a set of attributes as random variables.DG-SQL supports a seamless integration of (1) querying the data collection and constructionof learning sets;(2) learning from the learning sets; using parameterized transformers andoptionally defining an estimation utility; such as sum of squares of errors; to be minimized;(3)probabilistic prediction and simulation; using expressions that involve random variables;such as expectation; variance and probability of a logical formula; and (4) stochastic or …,Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences; Proceedings of the 41st Annual,2008,36
Enhancing Profiles for Anomaly Detection Using Time Granularities,Yingjiu Li; Ningning Wu; Sushil Jajodia; X Sean Wang,Abstract Recently; association rules have been used to generate profiles of “normal”behavior for anomaly detection. However; the time factor (especially in terms of multiple timegranularities) has not been utilized extensively in generation of these profiles. In reality; userbehavior during different time intervals may be very different. For example; the “normal”number and duration of FTP connections may vary from working hours to midnight; frombusiness day to weekend or holiday. Furthermore; these variations may depend on the dayof the month or the week. This paper proposes to build profiles using temporal associationrules in terms of multiple time granularities; and describes algorithms to discover theseprofiles. Because multiple time granularities are used for the profile generation; theproposed method is more flexible and precise than previous methods that use fixed …,Journal of Computer Security,2002,34
Evaluating continuous nearest neighbor queries for streaming time series via pre-fetching,Like Gao; Zhengrong Yao; X Sean Wang,Abstract For many applications; it is important to quickly locate the nearest neighbor of agiven time series. When the given time series is a streaming one; nearest neighbors mayneed to be found continuously at all time positions. Such a standing request is called acontinuous nearest neighbor query. This paper seeks fast evaluation of continuous querieson large databases. The initial strategy is to use the result of one evaluation to restrict thesearch space for the next. A more fundamental idea is to extend the existing indexingmethods; used in many traditional nearest neighbor algorithms; with pre-fetching.Specifically; pre-fetching is to predict the next value of the stream before it arrives; and toprocess the query as if the predicted value were the real one in order to load the neededindex pages and time series into the allocated cache memory. Furthermore; if the pre …,Proceedings of the eleventh international conference on Information and knowledge management,2002,33
Looking into the seeds of time: Discovering temporal patterns in large transaction sets,Yingjiu Li; Sencun Zhu; X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract This paper studies the problem of mining frequent itemsets along with theirtemporal patterns from large transaction sets. A model is proposed in which users define alarge set of temporal patterns that are interesting or meaningful to them. A temporal patterndefines the set of time points where the user expects a discovered itemset to be frequent.The model is general in that (i) no constraints are placed on the interesting patterns given bythe users; and (ii) two measures—inclusiveness and exclusiveness—are used to capturehow well the temporal patterns match the time points given by the discovered itemsets.Intuitively; these measures indicate to what extent a discovered itemset is frequent at timepoints included in a temporal pattern p; but not at time points not in p. Using these twomeasures; one is able to model many temporal data mining problems appeared in the …,Information Sciences,2006,31
A decisions query language (DQL): High-level abstraction for mathematical programming over databases,Alexander Brodsky; Mayur M Bhot; Manasa Chandrashekar; Nathan E Egge; X Sean Wang,Abstract The demonstrated; high-level decisions query language DQL combines thedecision optimization capability of mathematical programming and the data manipulationcapability of traditional database query languages. DQL benefits application developers intwo aspects. First; it avoids a conceptual impedance mismatch between mathematicalprogramming and data access and makes decision optimization functionality readilyaccessible to database programmers with no prior experience in operations research.Second; a tight integration provides unique opportunities for more efficient evaluation ascompared to a loosely coupled system. This demonstration uses an emergency responsescenario to illustrate the power of the language and its implementation.,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,29
Adaptive-size reservoir sampling over data streams,Mohammed Al-Kateb; Byung Suk Lee; X Sean Wang,Reservoir sampling is a well-known technique for sequential random sampling over datastreams. Conventional reservoir sampling assumes a fixed-size reservoir. There aresituations; however; in which it is necessary and/or advantageous to adaptively adjust thesize of a reservoir in the middle of sampling due to changes in data characteristics and/orapplication behavior. This paper studies adaptive size reservoir sampling over data streamsconsidering two main factors: reservoir size and sample uniformity. First; the paper conductsa theoretical study on the effects of adjusting the size of a reservoir while sampling is inprogress. The theoretical results show that such an adjustment may bring a negative impacton the probability of the sample being uniform (called uniformity confidence herein). Second;the paper presents a novel algorithm for maintaining the reservoir sample after the …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2007. SSBDM'07. 19th International Conference on,2007,29
Continuous similarity-based queries on streaming time series,Like Gao; Xiaoyang Sean Wang,In many applications; local or remote sensors send in streams of data; and the system needsto monitor the streams to discover relevant events/patterns and deliver instant reactioncorrespondingly. An important scenario is that the incoming stream is a continuallyappended time series; and the patterns are time series in a database. At each time when anew value arrives (called a time position); the system needs to find; from the database; thenearest or near neighbors of the incoming time series up to the time position. This paperattacks the problem by using fast Fourier transform (FFT) to efficiently find the crosscorrelations of time series; which yields; in a batch mode; the nearest and near neighbors ofthe incoming time series at many time positions. To take advantage of this batch processingin achieving fast response time; this paper uses prediction methods to predict future …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2005,29
Anontwist: Nearest neighbor querying with both location privacy and k-anonymity for mobile users,Song Wang; X Sean Wang,Protecting privacy of mobile users of location based services is a currently interestingresearch problem. Most protection techniques can be categorized into either those providinglocation privacy or those guaranteeing k-anonymity. A mobile user (i) has location privacy if;when he makes an LBS request; adversaries cannot tell his location precise enough tocause privacy concerns; and (ii) has k-anonymity if adversaries cannot distinguish him;among a group of k users; as the definite request issuer. SpaceTwist proposed recently [15]is in the former category; but makes no attempt to provide k-anonymity. The purpose of thispaper is to study a method that makes SpaceTwist provide k-anonymity in addition tolocation privacy. The extended algorithm is called AnonTwist. The major challenge is theability to make sure that at least k users are in the privacy area given in the SpaceTwist …,Mobile Data Management: Systems; Services and Middleware; 2009. MDM'09.

Risk assessment in distributed authorization,Peter Chapin; Christian Skalka; X Sean Wang,Abstract Distributed authorization takes into account several elements; including certificatesthat may be provided by non-local actors. While most trust management systems treat allassertions as equally valid up to certificate authentication; realistic considerations mayassociate risk with some of these elements; some actors may be less trusted than others;some elements may be more computationally expensive to obtain; and so forth.Furthermore; practical online authorization may require certain levels of risk to be tolerated.In this paper; we introduce a trust management logic that incorporates formal riskassessment. This formalization allows risk levels to be associated with authorizationelements; and promotes development of a distributed authorization algorithm allowingtolerable levels of risk to be precisely specified and rigorously enforced.,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM workshop on Formal methods in security engineering,2005,25
Intrusion detection in distributed systems: an abstraction-based approach,Peng Ning; Sushil Jajodia; X Sean Wang,Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are usually deployed along with other preventive securitymechanisms; such as access control and authentication; as a second line of defense thatprotects information systems. Intrusion detection complements the protective mechanisms toimprove the system security. Moreover; even if the preventive security mechanisms canprotect information systems successfully; it is still desirable to know what intrusions havehappened or are happening; so that the users can understand the security threats and risksand thus be better prepared for future attacks. Intrusion detection techniques are traditionallycategorized into two classes: anomaly detection and misuse detection. Anomaly detection isbased on the normal behavior of a subject (eg; user or a system); any action that significantlydeviates from the normal behavior is considered intrusive.

Design and implementation of a decentralized prototype system for detecting distributed attacks,Peng Ning; Sushil Jajodia; Xiaoyang Sean Wang,Abstract This paper presents the design and implementation of a decentralized researchprototype intrusion detection system (IDS) named coordinated attacks response anddetection system (CARDS); which aims at detecting distributed attacks that cannot bedetected using data collected at any single place. CARDS adopts a signature-basedapproach. It consists of three kinds of independent but cooperative components: signaturemanager; monitor; and directory service. Unlike traditional distributed IDSs; CARDSdecomposes global representations of distributed attacks into smaller units (called detectiontasks) that correspond to the distributed events indicating the attacks; and then executes andcoordinates the detection tasks in the places where the corresponding events are observed.,Computer Communications,2002,23
Semantic assumptions and query evaluation in temporal databases,Claudio Bettini; X Sean Wang; Elisa Bertino; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract When querying a temporal database; a user often makes certain semanticassumptions on stored temporal data. This paper formalizes and studies two types ofsemantic assumptions: point-based and interval-based. The point-based assumptionsinclude those assumptions that use interpolation methods; while the interval-basedassumptions include those that involve different temporal types (time granularities). Eachassumption is viewed as a way to derive certain implicit data from the explicit data stored inthe database. The database system must use all explicit as well as (possibly infinite) implicitdata to answer user queries. This paper introduces a new method to facilitate such queryevaluations. A user query is translated into a system query such that the answer of thissystem query over the explicit data is the same as that of the user query over the explicit …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1995,23
Indistinguishability: The other aspect of privacy,Chao Yao; Lingyu Wang; Sean X Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract Uncertainty and indistinguishability are two independent aspects of privacy.Uncertainty refers to the property that the attacker cannot tell which private value; among agroup of values; an individual actually has; and indistinguishability refers to the property thatthe attacker cannot see the difference among a group of individuals. While uncertainty hasbeen well studied and applied to many scenarios; to date; the only effort in providingindistinguishability has been the well-known notion of k-anonymity. However; k-anonymityonly applies to anonymized tables. This paper defines indistinguishability for generalsituations based on the symmetry among the possible private values associated withindividuals. The paper then discusses computational complexities of and provides practicalalgorithms for checking whether a set of database views provides enough …,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2006,21

Trust but verify: authorization for web services,Christian Skalka; X Sean Wang,Abstract Through web service technology; distributed applications can be built in a flexiblemanner; bringing tremendous power to applications on the web. However; this flexibilityposes significant challenges to security. In particular; an end user (be it human or machine)may access a web service directly; or through a number of intermediaries; while theseintermediaries may be formed on the fly for a particular task. Traditional access control fordistributed systems is not flexible and efficient enough in such an environment. Indeed; itmay be impossible for a web service to anticipate all possible access patterns; hence todefine an appropriate access control list beforehand. Novel solutions are needed. Thispaper introduces a trust-but-verify framework for web services authorization; and providesan implementation example. In the trust-but-verify framework; each web service maintains …,Proceedings of the 2004 workshop on Secure web service,2004,19
An XML-based Distributed Metadata Server (DIMES) supporting earth science metadata,Ruixin Yang; Xinhua Deng; Menas Kafatos; Changzhou Wang; X Sean Wang,With explosively increasing volumes of remote sensing; modelling and other Earth sciencedata available; and the popularity of the Internet; scientists are now facing challenges topublish and to find interesting data sets effectively and efficiently. Metadata has beenrecognized as a key technology to ease the searching and retrieval of Earth science data. Inthis paper; we discuss the DIMES (DIstributed MEtadata Server) prototype system. Designedto be flexible yet simple; DIMES uses XML to represent; store; retrieve and interoperatemetadata in a distributed environment. DIMES accepts metadata in any well-formed XMLformat and thus assumes the" tree" semantics of metadata entries.

Regular sequence operations and their use in database queries,Seymour Ginsburg; X Sean Wang,Abstract Operations on sequences are a basic component of database queries that extractinformation from sequenced data. This paper introduces a family of regular sequenceoperations (called rs-operations) to be used in such queries. The family is based on a simplepattern matching mechanism using regular expressions as its patterns; and includes most ofthe “natural” operations on sequences. Properties of the family are examined. In particular;operations in the family are characterized by a mechanical device called generic a-transducer; and the expressive power of the family is studied through an investigation offinite generators of the operations. The usage of the rs-operations in database queries isillustrated through an extended relational data model. Two equivalent query languages; onealgebraic and the other calculus; are given in the model. In these query languages; rs …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,1998,19
On the impact of user movement simulations in the evaluation of lbs privacy-preserving techniques,Sergio Mascetti; Dario Freni; Claudio Bettini; X Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract. The evaluation of privacy-preserving techniques for LBS is often based onsimulations of mostly random user movements that only partially capture real deploymentscenarios. We claim that benchmarks tailored to specific scenarios are needed; and wereport preliminary results on how they may be generated through an agent-basedcontextaware simulator. We consider privacy preserving algorithms based on spatialcloaking and compare the experimental results obtained on two benchmarks: the first basedon mostly random movements; and the second obtained from the context-aware simulator.The specific deployment scenario is the provisioning of a friend-finder-like service onweekend nights in a big city. Our results show that; compared to the contextaware simulator;the random user movement simulator leads to significantly different results for a spatial …,International Workshop on Privacy in Location-Based Applications,2008,18
A query facility for common intrusion detection framework,Peng Ning; X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract It is essential for intrusion detection systems to share information in order todiscover attacks involving multiple sites. Common Intrusion Detection Framework (CIDF) isan important step towards enabling different intrusion detection and response (IDR)components to interoperate with each other. Although CIDF provides an infrastructure andlanguage support that allows an IDR component to understand the information sent byanother component; it does not contain a facility for a component to request specificinformation from other components. The lack of such a facility may result in a waste ofprocessing time; storage capacity and network bandwidth. This paper proposes anextension to the Common Intrusion Specification Language (CISL); the language adoptedby CIDF; to model requests among CIDF components.

Regional co-locations of arbitrary shapes,Song Wang; Yan Huang; Xiaoyang Sean Wang,Abstract In many application domains; occurrences of related spatial features may exhibit co-location pattern. For example; some disease may be in spatial proximity of certain type ofpollution. This paper studies the problem of regional co-locations with arbitrary shapes.Regional co-locations represent regions in which two spatial features exhibit stronger orweaker co-location than that in other regions. Finding regional co-locations of arbitraryshapes is very challenging because:(1) statistical frameworks for mining regional co-locationdo not exist; and (2) testing all possible arbitrarily shaped regions is computationalprohibitive even for very small dataset. In this paper; we propose frequentist and Bayesianframeworks for mining regional co-locations and develop a probabilistic expansion heuristicto find arbitrary shaped regions.

An implementation of decentralized consensus building in sensor networks,Lei Chen; Greggory Carpenter; Sarah Greenberg; Jeff Frolik; X Sean Wang,In cognitive sensor networks; achieving consensus among the sensor nodes withoutrequiring centralized control is an important attribute that can enable quick and reliablenetwork decisions. Decentralized consensus building can be achieved through iterativeinformation exchange among sensor nodes. While much of the literature has concentratedon developing theory; minimizing the number of iterations is necessary in practice to reduceenergy consumption. In this work; we present an approach aimed at solving this practicalproblem. Specifically; the contributions of this work are fourfold. First; existing theoretical;continuous-time results are reformulated so that they can be implemented in physical;discrete-time hardware. Second; we show that the number of iterations needed to achieveconsensus can be minimized a priori for a given network topology. Third; we illustrate our …,IEEE Sensors Journal,2011,16
Mapping calendar expressions into periodical granularities,Claudio Bettini; Sergio Mascetti; X Sean Wang,An effort has been devoted in the recent years to study and formalize the concept of timegranularity and to design applications and services using the formalization. Among otherproposals; a calendar algebra has been defined to facilitate the specification of newgranularities and to perform conversions among them. This paper shows how granularitiesdefined as algebraic calendar expressions can be represented as periodical sets of instants.More precisely the paper shows how each algebraic operator changes the periodicalstructure of the granularities given as operands. These results have an immediateapplication enabling users to easily specify new granularities and using them in the onlyconstraint solver supporting time granularities that is currently available.,Temporal Representation and Reasoning; 2004.

Indexing very high-dimensional sparse and quasi-sparse vectors for similarity searches,Changzhou Wang; X Sean Wang,Abstract Similarity queries on complex objects are usually translated into searches amongtheir feature vectors. This paper studies indexing techniques for very high-dimensional (eg;in hundreds) vectors that are sparse or quasi-sparse; ie; vectors each having only a smallnumber (eg; ten) of non-zero or significant values. Based on the R-tree; the paper introducesthe xS-tree that uses lossy compression of bounding regions to guarantee a reasonableminimum fan-out within the allocated storage space for each node. In addition; the paperstudies the performance and scalability of the xS-tree via experiments.,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2001,16
Multilevel filtering for high dimensional nearest neighbor search,Changzhou Wang; X Sean Wang,Abstract Searching for nearest neighbors among a large number of vectors in a highdimensional space is usually costly and time-consuming. To support such high dimensionalnearest neighbor searches; low dimensional approximations of vectors are usually used tofilter out many vectors (and hence to reduce the search space). However; most existingstudies use only a single level approximations. This paper; instead; proposes a multilevelapproximation scheme. For each data vector; with its approximation (at any given level);both a lower bound and an upper bound can be derived on its distance from the queryvector. Distance bounds derived at a finer approximation level are tighter; but the cost toderive them is higher. The paper then presents two multilevel filtering methods using thisapproximation scheme. The coarsest level approximations; which are low in both volume …,In proceedings of ACM SIGMOD Workshop on Research Issues in Data Mining and Knowledge,2000,16

Reusing relational queries for intuitive decision optimization,Alexander Brodsky; Nathan Egge; X Sean Wang,Decision optimization is used in many applications such as those for finding the best courseof action in emergencies. However; optimization solutions require considerablemathematical expertise and effort to generate effective models. On the other hand; reportingapplications over databases are more intuitive and have long been established using themature database query technology. A decision optimization problem can be viewed as an"inverse" of the reporting problem. For example; a report may tell the total cost of a certainsupply chain given the various sourcing and transportation options used; the correspondingoptimization problem can be to select among all possible sourcing and transportationoptions to minimize the total cost.

Privacy protection through anonymity in location-based services,Claudio Bettini; Sergio Mascetti; X Sean Wang,Summary The adoption of location-based services (LBS) brings new privacy threats to users.The user location information revealed in LBS requests may be used by attackers toassociate sensitive information of the user with her identity. This contribution focuses onprivacy protection through anonymity; ie; keeping individual users indistinguishable in alarge group of people that may have issued the same request. The contribution identifiesdifferent privacy threats to LBS users; discusses techniques for protecting user privacy underdifferent threats; and gives a performance evaluation of the mentioned protection methods.,Handbook of Database Security,2008,15
Efficient evaluation of composite correlations for streaming time series,Min Wang; X Sean Wang,Abstract In applications ranging from stock trading to space mission operations; it isimportant to monitor the correlations among multiple streaming time series efficiently in orderto make timely decisions. The challenge is that both the number of streaming time series andthe number of interested correlations can be large. The straightforward way of performingthe evaluation by computing the correlation value for each relevant stream pair at each timeposition is not efficient enough in many situations. In this paper; we introduce an efficientmethod for the case where we need to monitor composite correlations; ie; conjunctions ofhigh correlations among multiple pairs of streaming time series. We use a simplemechanism to predict the correlation values of relevant stream pairs at the next time positionand rank the stream pairs carefully so that the pairs that are likely to have low correlation …,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2003,15
A pyramid data model for supporting content-based browsing and knowledge discovery,Zuotao Li; X Sean Wang; Menas Kafatos; Ruixin Yang,Remote sensing from space can provide global and continuous observations. Theassociated measurement data need to be stored and studied to understand the Earth systemprocesses. The ability of interactive content-based browsing; ie; browsing or searching thecontent to narrow-down the interesting portions of data sets prior to actually accessing orordering full data sets; is highly desirable for any Earth science data information system.However the large volumes of archived and future Earth science remote sensing data areclearly a serious challenge for an interactive browsing process. In this paper a pyramid datamodel is introduced to support interactive content-based browsing and knowledge discoveryfor a wide variety of Earth science remote sensing data sets.

Optimizing statistical queries by exploiting orthogonality and interval properties of grouping relations,Chang Li; X Sean Wang,A statistical query first manipulates source category data to build a target category in theform of a grouping relation and then performs statistical functions on the associatedmeasurement data. In this paper; the attributes in a grouping relation are partitioned into pair-wise disjoint sets; each called a dimension. A grouping relation is said to be orthogonal if itis equal to the cross product of the projections of itself on all the dimensions. Orthogonality isuseful in searching for and using pre-computed summaries on other categories. However; agrouping relation is sometimes not orthogonal; but rather k-partially orthogonal (ie; the unionof k orthogonal ones). It is shown that it is NP-complete to decide if a grouping relation is k-partially orthogonal. The paper then gives an algorithm to derive partial orthogonality. Alsoinvestigated in this paper are interval properties of grouping relations useful for optimizing …,Scientific and Statistical Database Systems; 1996.

Value range queries on earth science data via histogram clustering,Ruixin Yang; Kwang-Su Yang; Menas Kafatos; X Sean Wang,Abstract Remote sensing data as well as ground-based and model output data about theEarth system can be very large in volume. On the other hand; in order to use the dataefficiently; scientists need to search for data based on not only metadata but also actual datavalues. To answer value range queries by scanning very large volumes of data is obviouslyunrealistic. This article studies a clustering technique on histograms of data values onpredefined cells to index the cells. Through this index system; the so-called statistical rangequeries can be answered quickly and approximately together with an accuracy assessment.Examples of using this technique for Earth science data sets are given in this article.,*,2001,14
On approximation-based query evaluation; expensive predicates and constraint objects,Alexander Brodsky; X Sean Wang,Abstract The use of approximations of complex; possibly nested collection; objects canconsiderably improve the processing of queries with expensive predicates. Theimprovement is gained by (1) avoiding much of unnecessary evaluation of expensivepredicates; and (2) enabling the use of a signi cantly wider range of special-purposealgorithms; and indexing techniques working on approximations of objects. This paperdevelops a necessary query transformation infrastructure for such approximationbasedquery processing; in presence of extensible family of collection types; aggregation functions;indices and special purpose algorithms. The approximation-based ltering is formalized bythe notion of a ltering graph; whose arcs describe; intuitively; under which conditions altering predicate can be added before a predicate in a query.

revdroid: Code analysis of the side effects after dynamic permission revocation of android apps,Zheran Fang; Weili Han; Dong Li; Zeqing Guo; Danhao Guo; Xiaoyang Sean Wang; Zhiyun Qian; Hao Chen,Abstract Dynamic revocation of permissions of installed Android applications has beengaining popularity; because of the increasing concern of security and privacy in the Androidplatform. However; applications often crash or misbehave when their permissions arerevoked; rendering applications completely unusable. Even though Google has officiallyintroduced the new permission mechanism in Android 6.0 to explicitly support dynamicpermission revocation; the issue still exists. In this paper; we conduct an empirical study tounderstand the latest application practice post Android 6.0. Specifically; we design apractical tool; referred to as revDroid; to help us to empirically analyze how often theundesirable side effects; especially application crash; can occur in off-the-shelf Androidapplications.

Satisfiability of quantitative temporal constraints with multiple granularities,Claudio Bettinn; X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract Most work on temporal constraints has ignored the subtleties involved in dealingwith multiple time granularities. This paper considers a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP)where binary quantitative constraints in terms of different time granularities can be specifiedon a set of variables; and unary constraints are allowed to limit the domain of variables.Such a CSP cannot be trivially reduced to one of the known CSP problems. The main resultof the paper is a complete algorithm for checking consistency and finding a solution. Thecomplexity of the algorithm is studied in the paper under different assumptions about thegranularities involved in the CSP; and a second algorithm is proposed to improve theefficiency of the backtracking process needed to obtain all the solutions of the CSP.,International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming,1997,13
Mining partial periodic correlations in time series,Zhen He; X Sean Wang; Byung Suk Lee; Alan CH Ling,Abstract Recently; periodic pattern mining from time series data has been studiedextensively. However; an interesting type of periodic pattern; called partial periodic (PP)correlation in this paper; has not been investigated. An example of PP correlation is thatpower consumption is high either on Monday or Tuesday but not on both days. In general; aPP correlation is a set of offsets within a particular period such that the data at these offsetsare correlated with a certain user-desired strength. In the above example; the period is aweek (7 days); and each day of the week is an offset of the period. PP correlations canprovide insightful knowledge about the time series and can be used for predicting futurevalues. This paper introduces an algorithm to mine time series for PP correlations based onthe principal component analysis (PCA) method. Specifically; given a period; the …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2008,12
Expressing and optimizing similarity-based queries in SQL,Like Gao; Min Wang; X Sean Wang; Sriram Padmanabhan,Abstract Searching for similar objects (in terms of near and nearest neighbors) of a givenquery object from a large set is an essential task in many applications. Recent years haveseen great progress towards efficient algorithms for this task. This paper takes a querylanguage perspective; equipping SQL with the near and nearest search capability by addinga user-defined-predicate; called NN-UDP. The predicate indicates; among a set of objects; ifan object is a near or nearest-neighbor of a given query object. The use of the NN-UDPmakes the queries involving similarity searches intuitive to express. Unfortunately; traditionalcost-based optimization methods that deal with traditional UDPs do not work well for suchSQL queries. Better execution plans are possible with the introduction of a new operator;called NN-OP; which finds the near or nearest neighbors from a set of objects for a given …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2004,12
Improving the performance of continuous queries on fast data streams: Time series case,Like Gao; X Sean Wang,Abstract A continuous query on a data stream is a standing request that is processedwhenever a new data value arrives. For such a query; response time and throughput are twoimportant performance indicators. This paper concerns the performance of continuousqueries under different streaming rates. When the streaming rate is low and system can startevaluating the query without delay for each newly arrived data value; response time is thedominant performance indicator. When the streaming rate is high; both response time andthroughput become key issues since the query cannot get evaluated for each arrived datavalue without creating ever longer response time. This paper studies the scenario of astreaming time series. Every time a new value arrives; the query is to locate; in a time seriesdatabase; the nearest neighbor of the streaming series. The paper uses a pre-fetching …,In Workshop on Research Issues in Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery (DMKD,2002,12
Constraints Inference Channels and Secure Databases,Alexander Brodsky; Csilla Farkas; Duminda Wijesekera; X Sean Wang,Abstract This paper investigates the problem of confidentiality violations via illegal datainferences that occur when arithmetic constraints are combined with non-confidentialnumeric data to infer confidential information. The database is represented as a point in an(n+ k)-dimensional constraint space; where n is the number of numerical data items stored inthe database (extensional database) and k is the number of derivable attributes (intensionaldatabase). Database constraints over both extensional and intensional databases form an(n+ k)-dimensional constraint object. A query answer over a data item x is an interval I ofvalues along the x axis of the database such that I is correct (ie; the actual data value iswithin I) and safe (ie; users cannot infer which point within I is the actual data value). Thesecurity requirements are expressed by the accuracy with which users are allowed to …,International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming,2000,12
Free schedules for free agents in workflow systems,Claudio Bettini; X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,This paper investigates workflow systems in which the enactment and completion ofactivities have to satisfy a set of quantitative temporal constraints. Different activities areusually performed by autonomous agents; and the scheduling of activities by the enactmentservice has among its goals the minimization of communication and synchronization amongthe agents. The paper formally defines the notion of a schedule for these workflow systemsand its identifies a particularly useful class: free schedules. A schedule specifies a timerange for the enactment; duration and completion of each activity in order to satisfy all thetemporal constraints in the workflow. In a free schedule; an agent has to start its activitywithin the range specified in the schedule; but it is free to use any amount of time to finish theactivity as long as it is between a minimum and maximum time he has declared when the …,Temporal Representation and Reasoning; 2000.

An architecture for supporting interoperability among temporal databases,Claudio Bettini; X Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract A significant property of temporal data is their richness of semantics. Althoughseveral temporal data models and query languages have been designed specifically tohandle the temporal data; users must still deal with much of the implicit temporal information;which can be automatically derived from the stored data in certain situations. We propose amultidatabase architecture where an appropriate formalization of the intended semantics isassociated with each temporal relation and temporal database. This allows a temporalmediator to access the databases to retrieve implicit information in terms of time granularitiesdifferent from those used to store data. We also describe how the temporal mediator canprovide a user interface to the multidatabase system allowing temporal queries in terms ofarbitrary granularities and involving relations in different TDBMS.,Temporal Databases: Research and Practice,1998,11
Supporting movement pattern queries in user-specified scales,Yunyao Qu; Changzhou Wang; Like Gao; Xiaoyang Sean  Wang,An important investigation of moving objects involves searching for objects with specificmovement patterns; such as" going up;"" going towards southwest;" or a combination ofthese. Movement patterns can be in various scales; and larger-scale patterns usually spanover longer time periods with greater disturbances ignored. Movement pattern queries askfor moving objects which show a given movement pattern in a specific scale. This paperstudies database techniques to support fast evaluation of movement pattern queries in user-specified scales. The database is assumed to contain position information of moving objectssampled at a certain time interval. A movement pattern is defined as a regular expression ofmovement letters where each letter describes a set of movement directions. For each seriesof positions; movement directions of all scales are precomputed and results are mapped …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2003,10
Algebraic query languages on temporal databases with multiple time granularities,X Sean Wang,Abstract This paper investigates algebraic query languages on temporal databases. Thedata model used is an extension of the temporal modules introduced in [13]. A temporalmodule has a set of timestamped facts and has an associated temporal granularity(ortemporal type); and a temporal database is a set of temporal modules with possibly differenttemporal types. Temporal algebraa are proposed on this database model. Example queriesand results of the paper show that the algebras are rather expressive. The operations of thealgebras are organized into two groups: snapshot-wise operations and timestampoperations. Snapshot-wise operations are extensions of the traditional relational algebraoperations; while timestamp operations are extensions of first-order mappings fromtimestamps to timestamps. Multiple temporal types are only dealt with by these timestamp …,Proceedings of the fourth international conference on Information and knowledge management,1995,10
Supporting temporal reasoning by mapping calendar expressions to minimal periodic sets,Claudio Bettini; Sergio Mascetti; Xiaoyang Sean Wang,Abstract In the recent years several research efforts have focused on the concept of timegranularity and its applications. A first stream of research investigated the mathematicalmodels behind the notion of granularity and the algorithms to manage temporal data basedon those models. A second stream of research investigated symbolic formalisms providing aset of algebraic operators to define granularities in a compact and compositional way.However; only very limited manipulation algorithms have been proposed to operate directlyon the algebraic representation making it unsuitable to use the symbolic formalisms inapplications that need manipulation of granularities. This paper aims at filling the gapbetween the results from these two streams of research; by providing an efficient conversionfrom the algebraic representation to the equivalent low-level representation based on the …,Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research,2007,9
A predictive QoS control strategy for wireless sensor networks,Biyu Liang; Jeff Frolik; X Sean Wang,The number of active sensors in a wireless sensor network has been proposed as ameasure; albeit limited; for quality of service (QoS) for it dictates the spatial resolution of thesensed parameters. In very large sensor network applications; the number of sensor nodesdeployed may exceed the number required to provide the desired resolution. Herein wepropose a method; dubbed predictive QoS control (PQC); to manage the number of activesensors in such an over-deployed network. The strategy is shown to obtain near lifetime andvariance performance in comparison to a Bernoulli benchmark; with the added benefit of notrequiring the network to know the total number of sensors available. This benefit isespecially relevant in networks where sensors are prone to failure due to not only energyexhaustion but also environmental factors and/or those networks where nodes are …,Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems Conference; 2005.

Using triangle inequality to efficiently process continuous queries on high-dimensional streaming time series,Zhengrong Yao; Like Gao; X Sean Wang,In many applications; it is important to quickly find; from a database of patterns; the nearestneighbors of high-dimensional query points that come into the system in a streaming form.Treating each query point as a separate one is inefficient. Consecutive query points areoften neighbors in the high-dimensional space; and intermediate results in the processing ofone query should help the processing of the next. This paper extends the KD tree withtriangle inequality to deal with high-dimensional streaming time series. More specifically; thedistances calculated for earlier query points (to patterns) are used to filter out patterns thatare not possible to be the nearest neighbor of the current one. Experiments show that thisextension works well.,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2003. 15th International Conference on,2003,9
Logical design for temporal databases with multiple temporal types,X Sean Wang; Claudio Bettini; Alexander Brodsky; Sushil Jajodia,ABSTRACT The purpose of good database logical design is to eliminate data redundancyand insertion and deletion anomalies. In order to achieve this objective for temporaldatabases; the notions of temporal types and temporal functional dependencies (TFDs) areintroduced. A temporal type is a monotonic mapping from ticks of time (represented bypositive integers) to time sets (represented by subsets of reals) and is used to capturevarious standard and user-de ned calendars. A TFD is a proper extension of the traditionalfunctional dependency and takes the form X?! Y; meaning that there is a unique value for Yduring one tick of the temporal type for one particular X value. An axiomatization for TFDs isgiven. Since a nite set of TFDs usually implies an in nite number of TFDs; we introduce thenotion of and give an axiomatization for a nite closure to e ectively capture a nite set of …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems,1997,9

How anonymous is k-anonymous? look at your quasi-id,Claudio Bettini; X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract The concept of quasi-ID (QI) is fundamental to the notion of k-anonymity that hasgained popularity recently as a privacy-preserving method in microdata publication. Thispaper shows that it is important to provide QI with a formal underpinning; which; surprisingly;has been generally absent in the literature. The study presented in this paper provides a firstlook at the correct and incorrect uses of QI in k-anonymization processes and exposes theimplicit conservative assumptions when QI is used correctly. The original notions introducedin this paper include (1) k-anonymity under the assumption of a formally defined externalinformation source; independent of the QI notion; and (2) k-QI; which is an extension of thetraditional QI and is shown to be a necessary refinement. The concept of k-anonymitydefined in a world without using QI is an interesting artifact itself; but more importantly; it …,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2008,7
Feature selection for building cost-effective data stream classifiers,Like Gao; X Sean Wang,A stream classifier is a decision model that assigns a class label to a data stream; based onits arriving data. Various features of the stream can be used in the classifier; each of whichmay have different relevance to the classification task and different cost in obtaining itsvalue. As time passes by; some less costly features may become more relevant; but the timeneeded for decision may be considered as a cost. A challenge is how to balance thedifferent costs when building a cost-effective classifier. This paper proposes a new featureselection strategy that extends the traditional relief algorithm in two aspects:(1) estimate theclassification cost associated with each feature; and (2) order all the features with a scorethat combines both cost estimation and classification relevance. A classifier is then built withthe selected features using a traditional classification method. Experimental results show …,Data Mining; Fifth IEEE International Conference on,2005,7
A learning-based approach to estimate statistics of operators in continuous queries: a case study,Like Gao; Min Wang; X Sean Wang; Sriram Padmanabhan,Abstract Statistic estimation such as output size estimation of operators is a well-studiedsubject in the database research community; mainly for the purpose of query optimization.The assumption; however; is that queries are ad-hoc and therefore the emphasis has beenon capturing the data distribution. When long standing continuous queries on a changingdatabase are concerned; a more direct approach; namely building an estimation model foreach operator; is possible. In this paper; we propose a novel learning-based method. Ourmethod consists of two steps. The first step is to design a dedicated feature extractionalgorithm that can be used incrementally to obtain feature values from the underlying data.The second step is to use a data mining algorithm to generate an estimation model basedon the feature values extracted from the historical data. To illustrate the approach; this …,Proceedings of the 8th ACM SIGMOD workshop on Research issues in data mining and knowledge discovery,2003,7

Proactive and reactive multi-dimensional histogram maintenance for selectivity estimation,Zhen He; Byung Suk Lee; X Sean Wang,Abstract Many state-of-the-art selectivity estimation methods use query feedback to maintainhistogram buckets; thereby using the limited memory efficiently. However; they are “reactive”in nature; that is; they update the histogram based on queries that have come to the systemin the past for evaluation. In some applications; future occurrences of certain queries may bepredicted and a “proactive” approach can bring much needed performance gain; especiallywhen combined with the reactive approach. For these applications; this paper provides amethod that builds customized proactive histograms based on query prediction and mergersthem into reactive histograms when the predicted future arrives. Thus; the method is calledthe proactive and reactive histogram (PRHist). Two factors affect the usefulness of theproactive histograms and are dealt with during the merge process: the first is the …,Journal of Systems and Software,2008,6
Policy-driven physical attacks in sensor networks: modeling and measurement,Xun Wang; Sriram Chellappan; Wenjun Gu; Wei Yu; Dong Xuan,Sensor nodes being small in size and distributively deployed; are vulnerable to physicalattacks that attempt to physically destroy sensors in the sensor network. Generally speaking;physical attacks in sensor networks can be classified into two types: blind physical attacksand search-based physical attacks. In blind attacks; sensors are destroyed using brute-forceapproaches (like bombs/grenades etc.). The advantage here is the rapidness in destroyingsensors. The downside however; is the fact that the deployment field also suffers significantcasualties. If the attacker wishes to preserve the deployment field; the attacker will conductsearch-based attacks by searching for sensors in the field and destroying only the sensors.While this preserves the deployment field; the attack process is slow. In this paper; wepresent policy-driven physical attacks; where the bias between the twin objectives of the …,Wireless Communications and Networking Conference; 2006. WCNC 2006. IEEE,2006,6

Finding the plateau in an aggregated time series,Min Wang; X Sean Wang,Abstract Given d input time series; an aggregated series can be formed by aggregating the dvalues at each time position. It is often useful to find the time positions whose aggregatedvalues are the greatest. Instead of looking for individual top-k time positions; this paper givestwo algorithms for finding the time interval (called the plateau) in which the aggregatedvalues are close to each other (within a given threshold) and are all no smaller than theaggregated values outside of the interval. The first algorithm is a centralized one assumingthat all data are available at a central location; and the other is a distributed search algorithmthat does not require such a central location. The centralized algorithm has a linear timecomplexity with respect to the length of the time series; and the distributed algorithmemploys the Threshold Algorithm by Fagin et al. and is quite efficient in reducing the …,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2006,5

Recent years haveseen a rapid growth in system scales and the corresponding rapid increase in the amount oflog event data. At the same time; as logs are found to be a valuable information source; loganalysis tasks have become more sophisticated demanding both interactive exploratoryquery processing and batch computation. Desirable query types include selection with timeranges and value filtering criteria; join within time windows; join between log data andreference tables; and various aggregation types. In such a situation; parallel solutions arenecessary; but existing parallel and distributed solutions either support limited query typesor perform only batch computations on logs.

If thecensus microdata also contain the “Salary;” attribute; one can generate a magnitude tabledisplaying the average salary for each job type in each town.

Reasoning with advanced policy rules and its application to access control,Claudio Bettini; Sushil Jajodia; X Sean Wang; Duminda Wijesekera,Abstract This paper presents a formal framework to represent and manage advanced policyrules; which incorporate the notions of provision and obligation. Provisions are thoseconditions that need to be satisfied or actions that must be performed by a user or an agentbefore a decision is rendered; while obligations are those conditions or actions that must befulfilled by either the user or agent or by the system itself within a certain period of time afterthe decision. This paper proposes a specific formalism to express provisions and obligationswithin a policy and investigates a reasoning mechanism within this framework. A policydecision may be supported by more than one rule-based derivation; each associated with apotentially different set of provisions and obligations (called a global PO set). The reasoningmechanism can derive all the global PO sets for each specific policy decision and …,International Journal on Digital Libraries,2004,4
Condition Evaluation for Speculative Systems: a Streaming Time Series Case.,Xiaoyang Sean Wang; Like Gao; Min Wang,Abstract Application systems often need to react with certain actions whenever some presetconditions are satisfied. In many cases; the evaluation of these conditions takes long time;but some prediction of the results can be obtained rather quickly. In this situation;speculation may be a good idea. That is; the system takes predictions (speculation) toprepare (such as prefetch) for the possible reaction. Obviously; the risk is wasted efforts dueto false alarms. Higher precision prediction results in less waste; but takes longer time andmay reduce/eliminate the opportunity for speculation. A balance needs to be struck. A quality-driven prediction subsystem is thus necessary; so that the “user” of the prediction subsystemcan impose quality (in terms of precision and response-time) requirements. This paperfocuses on such a prediction subsystem with conditions on streaming time series. Two …,STDBM,2004,4

Cost-based join algorithm selection in hadoop,Jun Gu; Shu Peng; X Sean Wang; Weixiong Rao; Min Yang; Yu Cao,Abstract In recent years; MapReduce has become a popular computing framework for bigdata analysis. Join is a major query type for data analysis and various algorithms have beendesigned to process join queries on top of Hadoop. Since the efficiency of differentalgorithms differs on the join tasks on hand; to achieve a good performance; users need toselect an appropriate algorithm and use the algorithm with a proper configuration; which israther difficult for many end users. This paper proposes a cost model to estimate the cost offour popular join algorithms. Based on the cost model; the system may automatically choosethe join algorithm with the least cost; and then give the reasonable configuration values forthe chosen algorithm.

Threeoptimization algorithms; each under a different set of quality requirements; are developed inthe framework:(1) minimize the response time given accuracy requirements and without loadshedding;(2) minimize the load shedding given a response time limit and accuracyrequirements; and (3) minimize one type of accuracy errors given a response time limit andwithout load shedding.

High-dimensional nearest neighbor search with remote data centers,Changzhou Wang; Xiaoyang Sean Wang,Abstract. Many data centers have archived a tremendous amount of data and begun topublish them on the Web. Due to limited resources and large amount of service requests;data centers usually do not directly support high-cost queries. On the other hand; users areoften overwhelmed by the huge data volume and cannot afford to download the whole datasets and search them locally. To support high-dimensional nearest neighbor searches in thisenvironment; the paper develops a multi-level approximation scheme. The coarsest-levelapproximations are stored locally and searched first. The result is then refined gradually viaaccesses to remote data centers. Data centers need only to deliver data items or theirprecomputed finer level approximations by their identifiers. The searching process is usuallylong in this environment; since it involves remote sites. This paper describes an online …,Knowledge and information systems,2002,3
Semi-homogenous generalization: Improving homogenous generalization for privacy preservation in cloud computing,Xian-Mang He; Xiaoyang Sean Wang; Dong Li; Yan-Ni Hao,Abstract Data security is one of the leading concerns and primary challenges for cloudcomputing. This issue is getting more and more serious with the development of cloudcomputing. However; the existing privacy-preserving data sharing techniques either fail toprevent the leakage of privacy or incur huge amounts of information loss. In this paper; wepropose a novel technique; termed as linking-based anonymity model; which achieves K-anonymity with quasi-identifiers groups (QI-groups) having a size less than K. In themeanwhile; a semi-homogenous generalization is introduced to be against the attackincurred by homogenous generalization. To implement linking-based anonymization model;we propose a simple yet efficient heuristic local recoding method. Extensive experiments onreal datasets are also conducted to show that the utility has been significantly improved …,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2016,2
Converting spatiotemporal data among heterogeneous granularity systems,Muhao Chen; Shi Gao; X Sean Wang,Spatiotemporal data are often expressed in terms of granularities to indicate themeasurement units of the data. A granularity system usually consists of a set of granularitiesthat share a “common refined granularity”(CRG) to enable granular comparison and dataconversion within the system. However; if data from multiple granularity systems needs to beused in a unified application; it is necessary to extend the data conversion and comparisonwithin a granularity system to those for multiple granularity systems. This paper proposes aformal framework to enable such an extension. The framework involves essentially somepreconditions and properties for verifying the existence of a CRG and unifying conversionsof incongruous semantics; and supports the approach to integrate multiple systems into oneso as to process granular interoperation across systems just like in a single system …,Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE); 2016 IEEE International Conference on,2016,2
Privacy and anonymity in location data management,Claudio Bettini; Sergio Mascetti; Dario Freni; X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,A growing number of applications and services include among their parameters a spatialand temporal characterization of some of the objects that they store and process. Theseapplications are enabled by technologies; like GPS; WiFi positioning; or cellular networkbased methods; that can provide real-time data about the position of moving objects. Someapplications do not permanently store location data that is just received; processed; anddeleted. This is sometimes enforced as a privacy preserving policy in the provisioning oflocation based services (LBS). However; in most cases; location data are permanentlystored as any other data; to provide a better service (eg; to understanding direction andspeed of objects;,Privacy-aware knowledge discovery: Novel applications and new techniques,2010,2

Information release control: A learning-based architecture,Claudio Bettini; X Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract Modern information system applications involve collaboration in the form ofinformation flow through organization boundaries. Indeed; organizations have vast amountsof information that is shared with other organizations and even the general public for variouspurposes. In addition to the standard network-level protections; systems usually use someaccess control mechanisms to protect data. However; access control systems are notdesigned to deal with deliberate and accidental release of information; to which the user hasthe authority to access but is not supposed to be released. Moreover; effective accesscontrol assumes a perfect categorization of information; which is increasingly difficult in acomplex information system. Information release control is viewed as complementary toaccess control; and aims at restricting the outgoing information flow at the boundary of …,Journal on Data Semantics II,2005,2
A learning-based approach to information release control,Claudio Bettini; X Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract Controlled release of information from an organization is becoming important fromvarious considerations: privacy; competitive information protection; strategic data control;and more. In most organizations; data protection is afforded only by using access control;However; it can be argued that access control suffers from at least two problems. First;effective access control assumes a perfect categorization of information (“who can accesswhat”); which is increasingly difficult in a complex information system. Second; accesscontrol is not effective against insider attacks; where users whith legitimate access rightssend out sensitive information; either with malicious intent or by accident. Informationrelease control is viewed as complementary to access control; and aims at restricting theoutgoing information flow at the boundary of information systems.

Entity suggestion with conceptual explanation,Yi Zhang; Yanghua Xiao125; Seung-won Hwang; Haixun Wang; X Sean Wang; Wei Wang,Abstract Entity Suggestion with Conceptual Explanation (ESC) refers to a type of entityacquisition query in which a user provides a set of example entities as the query and obtainsin return not only some related entities but also concepts which can best explain the queryand the result. ESC is useful in many applications such as related-entity recommendationand query expansion. Many example based entity suggestion solutions are available inexisting literatures. However; they are generally not aware of the concepts of query entitiesthus cannot be used for conceptual explanation. In this paper; we propose two probabilisticentity suggestion models and their computation solutions. Our models and solutions fullytake advantage of the large scale taxonomies which consist of isA relations between entitiesand concepts.

Finding maximal ranges with unique topics in a text database,Zhihui Yang; Huixin Ma; Zhenying He; X Sean Wang,Abstract Recent years have witnessed the rapid growth of text data; and thus the increasingimportance of in-depth analysis of text data for various applications. Text data are oftenorganized in a database with documents labeled by attributes like time and location.Different documents manifest different topics. The topics of the documents may changealong the attributes of the documents; and such changes have been the subject of researchin the past. However; previous analyses techniques; such as topic detection and tracking;topic lifetime; and burstiness; all focus on the topic behavior of the documents in a givenattribute range without contrasting to the documents in the overall range. This paperintroduces the concept of uniquetopics; referring to those topics that only appear frequentlywithin a small range of documents but not in the whole range. These unique topics may …,World Wide Web,2017,1

Entity suggestion by example using a conceptual taxonomy,Yi Zhang; Yanghua Xiao; Seung-won Hwang; Haixun Wang; X Sean Wang; Wei Wang,Abstract: Entity suggestion by example (ESbE) refers to a type of entity acquisition query inwhich a user provides a set of example entities as the query and obtains in return someentities that best complete the concept underlying the given query. Such entity acquisitionqueries can be useful in many applications such as related-entity recommendation andquery expansion. A number of ESbE query processing solutions exist in the literature.However; they mostly build only on the idea of entity co-occurrences either in text or weblists; without taking advantage of the existence of many web-scale conceptual taxonomiesthat consist of hierarchical isA relationships between entity-concept pairs. This paperprovides a query processing method based on the relevance models between entity setsand concepts. These relevance models can be used to obtain the fine-grained concepts …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.08996,2015,1
Cost-based optimization of logical partitions for a query workload in a hadoop data warehouse,Shu Peng; Jun Gu; X Sean Wang; Weixiong Rao; Min Yang; Yu Cao,Abstract Recently; Hadoop has become a common programming framework for big dataanalysis on a cluster of commodity machines. To optimize queries on a large amount of datamanaged by the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS); it is particularly important tooptimize the reading of the data. Previous works either designed file formats to cluster databelonging to the same column; or proposed to place correlated data onto the same physicalnodes. In query-workload aware situation; a possible optimization strategy is to place datathat may not be used by the same query into different logical partitions so that not everypartition is needed for a query; while physically distribute the data in each partition evenlyacross the compute nodes. This paper proposes a condition-based partitioning scheme toimplement this optimization strategy. Experiments show that the proposed scheme not …,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2014,1
Evaluation of range queries with predicates on moving objects,Mitzi McCarthy; Zhen He; X Sean Wang,A well-studied query type on moving objects is the continuous range query. An interestingand practical situation is that instead of being continuously evaluated; the query may beevaluated at different degrees of continuity; eg every 2 seconds (close to continuous); every10 minutes or at irregular time intervals (close to snapshot). Furthermore; the range querymay be stacked under predicates applied to the returned objects. An example is the countpredicate that requires the number of objects in the range to be at least Y. The conjecture isthat these two practical considerations can help reduce communication costs. We propose asafe region-based solution that exploits these two practical considerations. An extensiveexperimental study shows that our solution can reduce communication costs by a factor of9.5 compared to an existing state-of-the-art system.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,1
Continually answering constraint k-NN queries in unstructured P2P systems,Bin Wang; Xiao-Chun Yang; Guo-Ren Wang; Ge Yu; Lei Chen; X Sean Wang; Xue-Min Lin,Abstract We consider the problem of efficiently computing distributed geographical k-NNqueries in an unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) system; in which each peer is managed by anindividual organization and can only communicate with its logical neighboring peers. Suchqueries are based on local filter query statistics; and require as less communication cost aspossible; which makes it more difficult than the existing distributed k-NN queries. Especially;we hope to reduce candidate peers and degrade communication cost. In this paper; wepropose an efficient pruning technique to minimize the number of candidate peers to beprocessed to answer the k-NN queries. Our approach is especially suitable for continuous k-NN queries when updating peers; including changing ranges of peers; dynamically leavingor joining peers; and updating data in a peer. In addition; simulation results show that the …,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2008,1
Privacy protection with uncertainty and indistinguishability,X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,In many data systems; it is important to protect individual privacy while satisfying applicationrequirements. To provide such protection; privacy disclosure must be measured in somequantitative manner; as absolute privacy is usually not a practical proposition. Privacymeasurement metrics have appeared in the literature; but they are either for single tablescenarios (eg;[17; 22; 23]); or for a more theoretical purpose (eg;[20]). This chapterintroduces two data privacy measures that can be used for general relational data releasesand that are amenable to practical applications; and outlines challenges and possiblesolutions in using these measures in applications.,Digital Privacy: Theory; Technologies; and Practices,2007,1
Trust management: Features and foundations,Peter C Chapin; Christian Skalka; X Sean Wang,Trust management systems are frameworks for authorization in modern distributed systems;allowing remotely accessible resources to be protected by providers. By allowing providersto specify policy; and access requesters to possess certain access rights; trust managementautomates the process of determining whether access should be allowed on the basis ofpolicy; rights; and an authorization semantics. In this paper we survey modern stateof-the-artin trust management; focusing on features of policy and rights languages that provide thenecessary expressiveness for modern practice. We characterize systems in light of a genericstructure that takes into account components of practical implementations. We emphasizesystems that have a formal foundation; since security properties of them can be rigorouslyguaranteed. Underlying formalisms are reviewed to provide necessary background.,*,2006,1

Identifying sensitive associations in databases for release control,Claudio Bettini; Xiaoyang Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract In a database system; authorization-based access-control is generally the first lineof defense; preventing unauthorized accesses to secret or sensitive data. However; thismechanism is susceptible to security breaches due to improper authorization (eg; thegeneral public is mistakenly granted access to a copy of sensitive data) and cannot blockinsider attacks (an authorized user accidentally or intentionally discloses secrets tooutsiders). Supplementary to access-control; the release-control mechanism is to check allthe outgoing documents for any leak of secret or sensitive information. This paper reportspreliminary results on a specific release-control task; namely; how to deal with sensitiveassociations that need to be restricted from releasing. A sensitive association refers to a pairof values whose connection involves some secrets. The disclosure of such a pair may …,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2004,1

Optimizing relational store for e-catalog queries: a data mining approach,Min Wang; X Sean Wang,Abstract A frequent use of database management systems in electronic commerce is toprovide electronic product catalogs (e-catalogs) that allow users to search for products ofinterest via constraints on attributes. An intuitively straightforward representation of e-catalogs is to use one table for the whole e-catalog as it is conceptually easy to maintain andquery. However; for any e-commerce business with a reasonably large number of productsand product types; its e-catalog usually involves a large number of attributes due to the greatvariety of the products; and at the same time; contains a large number of null values due tothe fact that each product only has values under a relatively small number of attributes.Because of these properties; the above intuitive method does not work well in currentrelational database systems. Techniques have been proposed in the literature to deal …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2002,1
Covering Bitmap with Trapezoids is Hard,Changzhou Wang; X Sean Wang,Abstract Each sub-series of a time series can be mapped to a point on a plane whose twocoordinates represent the starting time and the ending time; respectively. In certainapplications; points with similar properties are likely to be clustered in a special trapezoidshape. To save these points in a compact way; the following optimization problem needs tobe studied: find the minimum number of trapezoids which cover a given set of points. Thispaper formalizes the optimization problem as a decision problem; namely; Bitmap Coverwith special Trapezoids (BCT); and proves that BCT is NP-hard.,*,2001,1

Extending CIDF to support queries,Peng Ning; X Sean Wang; Susshil Jajodia,In order to discover Coordinated attacks involving mulhple sites; it is essential for intrusiondetection systems to shareinfomation. Common Inirusion Detection Framework (CIDF) is animportant step towards enabling different intrusion and response (IDR) components tointeroperate with each other. Although CIDF provides an infrastructure and languagesupport that allows an IDR component tounderstand the infomation that is sent by anothercomponent; it does not contain a facility for an IDR component to request specificinformationfrom another component. The lack of such a facility may result in a waste of processing time;storage capacity and netWorkbandwidth.

Temporal Semantic Assumptions and Their Use in Database Query Evaluation,Claudio Bettini; X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract Temporal data explicitly stored in a temporal database are often associated withcertain semantic assumptions. Each assumption can be viewed as a way of deriving implicitinformation from the explicitly stored data. Rather than leaving the task of deriving (possiblyinfinite) implicit data to application programs; as is the case currently; it is desirable that thisbe handled by the database management systems. To achieve this; this paper formalizesand studies two types of semantic assumptions: point-based and interval-based. The point-based assumptions include those assumptions that use interpolation methods; while theinterval-based assumptions include those that involve different temporal types (timegranularities). In order to incorporate semantic assumptions into query evaluation; this paperintroduces a translation procedure that converts a user query into a system query such …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1995,1
senDroid: Auditing Sensor Access in Android System-wide,Weili Han; Chang Cao; Hao Chen; Dong Li; Zheran Fang; Wenyuan Xu; Xiaoyang Sean Wang,Sensors are widely used in modern mobile devices (eg; smartphones; watches) and maygather information; including photos; sounds and locations; from environments as well asabout users. However; the powerful sensing abilities provide opportunities for attackers tosteal both personal sensitive data and commercial secrets. Unfortunately; the current designonly provides a coarse access control on sensors and does not have the capability to auditsensing. In this paper; we firstly leverage a hook-based track method; where the processesof applications and Android system will be hooked to track sensor accesses. Thus; sensingoperations will be intercepted and audited according to predefined audit policies.

Socialized policy administration,Zeqing Guo; Weili Han; Liangxing Liu; Wenyuan Xu; Minyue Ni; Yunlei Zhao; Xiaoyang Sean Wang,Abstract With the rapid development of mobile applications and online social networks;users often encounter a frustrating challenge to set privacy and security policies (ie;permission requests) of various applications correctly. For instance; in an Android system; itis hard for users; even programmers; to identify malicious permission requests (policies)when they install a third-party application. To simplify the task of policy management; in thispaper; we propose a novel policy administration method where the policy settings fromusers' friends will be used as a key recommendation to guide policy administration; and thesecurity of friends' privacy will be protected. We propose to let a user invite his or her friendsto help with policy setting in applications; and we call such a method socialized policyadministration (SPA for short).

Supporting Temporal Reasoning by Mapping Calendar Expressions to Minimal Periodic Sets,Claudio Bettini; Sergio Mascetti; X Sean Wang,Abstract In the recent years several research efforts have focused on the concept of timegranularity and its applications. A first stream of research investigated the mathematicalmodels behind the notion of granularity and the algorithms to manage temporal data basedon those models. A second stream of research investigated symbolic formalisms providing aset of algebraic operators to define granularities in a compact and compositional way.However; only very limited manipulation algorithms have been proposed to operate directlyon the algebraic representation making it unsuitable to use the symbolic formalisms inapplications that need manipulation of granularities. This paper aims at filling the gapbetween the results from these two streams of research; by providing an efficient conversionfrom the algebraic representation to the equivalent low-level representation based on the …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1110.2213,2011,*
Answering constrained k-NN queries in unstructured P2P systems,Bin Wang; Xiaochun Yang; Guoren Wang; Lei Chen; Sean Wang; Xuemin Lin; Ge Yu,Abstract The processing of k-NN queries has been studied extensively both in a centralizedcomputing environment and in a structured P2P environment. However; the problem over anunstructured P2P system is not well studied despite of their popularity. Communication-efficient processing of k-NN queries in such an environment is a unique challenge due to thedistribution; dynamics and large scale of the system. In this paper; we investigate theproblem of efficiently computing k-NN queries over unstructured P2P systems. We firstpropose a location-based domination model to determine a search space. We then presenttwo types of probing strategies; radius-convergence and radius-expanding. Acomprehensive performance study demonstrates that our techniques are efficient andscalable.,Databases; Information Systems; and Peer-to-Peer Computing,2007,*
Quality of Service Guarantee in Data Sharing Environment,Xiaoqing Wang; Yanxing Zheng; Meilin Shi,Summary A large variety of Web-based applications demand access and integration of up-to-date information from multiple distributed and heterogeneous information systems. Data-Sharing Environments (DSE) contribute to the achievement of information superiority whichwill enable decision dominance. The goal of DSE is to help data interaction betweendistributed and heterogeneous information sources. One challenge in Data Sharing is howto select the right data at the right time and right cost. We call this problem as quality ofservice (QoS) guarantee in DSE. In this paper; we model the problem and present anefficient mechanism to deal with QoS guarantee in DSE.,IJCSNS,2006,*
Dipartimento di Informatica e Comunicazione,Claudio Bettini; X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,The concept of k-anonymity; used in the recent literature (eg;[10; 11; 7; 5; 1]) to formallyevaluate the privacy preservation of published tables; was introduced in the seminal papersof Samarati and Sweeney [10; 11] based on the notion of quasi-identifiers (or QI for short).The process of obtaining k-anonymity for a given private table is first to recognize the QIs inthe table; and then to anonymize the QI values; the latter being called k-anonymization.While k-anonymization is usually rigorously validated by the authors; the definition of QIremains mostly informal; and different authors seem to have different interpretations of theconcept of QI. The purpose of this short note is to provide a formal underpinning of QI andexamine the correctness and incorrectness of various interpretations of QI in our formalframework.

AKSED: adaptive knowledge-based system for event detection using collaborative unmanned aerial vehicles,X Sean Wang; Byung Suk Lee; Firooz Sadjadi,Advances in sensor technology and image processing have made it possible to equipunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with economical; high-resolution; energy-efficientsensors. Despite the improvements; current UAVs lack autonomous and collaborativeoperation capabilities; due to limited bandwidth and limited on-board image processingabilities. The situation; however; is changing. In the next generation of UAVs; much imageprocessing can be carried out onboard and communication bandwidth problem will improve.More importantly; with more processing power; collaborative operations among a team ofautonomous UAVs can provide more intelligent event detection capabilities.

Extending Common Intrusion Detection Framework (CIDF) to Support Queries,Peng Ning; Sushil Jajodia; X Sean Wang,CIDF is the result of an on-going work that aims at enabling different intru- sion detection andresponse (IDR) components to interoperate and share infor- mation [Feiertag et aI.; 2000a; Kahnet aI.; 1998a; Kahn et aI.; 1998b; Porras et aI.; 1998; Tung; 1998]. The CIDF working group wasformed as a collab- oration among DARPA funded IDR projects. Although CIDF provides anin- frastructure and language support that allows an IDR component to understand the informationthat is sent by a remote IDR component; it does not contain a facility for an IDR component torequest specific information from another component. As we discussed earlier; the lack of sucha facility may result in inefficient communication between IDR components.

Decentralized Detection of Distributed Attacks,Peng Ning; Sushil Jajodia; X Sean Wang,Abstract Research efforts on scalable distributed intrusion detection have been focused onhierarchical IDSs; which organize IDSs into hierarchies and require low-level IDSs senddesignated information to high-level IDSs. The hierarchies of IDSs are usually developedaccording to administrative concerns. For example; IDSs for individual hosts are organizedunder IDSs for departments; while IDSs for departments are organized under an IDS for theentire enterprise. However; there are often mismatches between such organizations of IDSsand detection of distributed attacks. In this chapter; we present an alternative approach toorganizing autonomous but cooperative component systems to detect distributed attacks.Our approach is based on the dependency among the distributed events in a signature.Unlike the hierarchical approach; our approach organizes the cooperative IDSs …,*,2004,*
System View and Event History,Peng Ning; Sushil Jajodia; X Sean Wang,In this chapter; we propose to use an intermediate layer; which we call sys- tem view; to providea unified representation of the information provided by different types of systems. A system viewserves two purposes. First; it can hide the differences be- tween heterogeneous systems. Forexample; most of the platforms (eg; UNIX and Windows NT) have login process to authenticateusers. Though the sta- tus of the login processes on different platforms may be recorded in differentformats (eg; BSM on Solaris and Windows Event Logger on Windows); we can transform suchinformation into a unified representation on a common sys- tem view that abstracts the commonfeatures of login processes. Certainly; the correspondence between the same kind of informationon different platforms may be more complex than simple one-to-one mappings between auditrecords. However; compared with the possible attacks that we may discover and de …,*,2004,*
Discovering sequential patterns from non-uniform databases,Du Dang; X Sean Wang,Abstract Databases; when used to collect data in the dynamic world; change over time. As aconsequence; different parts of a database that come into the database at different timesmay contain activities with different characteristics. In other words; the data in the databaseare “non-uniform”. This non-uniformity of the database gives rise to the idea of a Divide andConquer strategy that divides a very large and non-uniform database into component partsfor better mining.

Constraint Reasoning,Claudio Bettini; Sushil Jajodia; X Sean Wang,Abstract We have seen in the previous chapters the impact that time granularities can havein the design and managing of temporal databases. In Chap. 4 time granularities are alsoused to perform a special kind of temporal reasoning; deriving implicit information fromexplicit temporal data. A different form of temporal reasoning involves deriving informationon the temporal distance between two events given incomplete information on the distancesamong a larger set of events. This reasoning has been particularly investigated in artificialintelligence for planning and scheduling problems; but it can find interesting applicationsalso in research areas closer to data management. In this chapter we investigate how theintroduction of a rich model for time granularities can be integrated with the knowntechniques for this form of temporal reasoning.,*,2000,*
An Application to Knowledge Discovery,Claudio Bettini; Sushil Jajodia; X Sean Wang,Abstract A huge amount of data is collected every day in the form of event time sequences.Common examples are recordings of different values of stock shares during a day; accessesto a computer via an external network; bank transactions; or events related to malfunctions inan industrial plant. These sequences register events with corresponding values of certainprocesses; and are valuable sources of information not only to search for a particular valueor event at a specific time; but also to analyze the frequency of certain events; or sets ofevents related by particular temporal relationships. These types of analyses can be veryuseful for deriving implicit information from the raw data; and for predicting the futurebehavior of the monitored process.,*,2000,*
Querying Temporal Databases with Multiple Views,Claudio Bettini; Sushil Jajodia; X Sean Wang,Abstract A prominent feature of temporal information is its richness in semantics associatedwith its temporal domain. When querying a temporal database; a user naturally assumessome “usual” semantics on stored temporal data. For instance; she expects that her bankaccount balance persists; ie; the balance stays the same unless a transaction—deposit;withdrawal; or accrual of interest—is performed. Therefore; if she wishes to find the balanceat a particular time and no balance amount is stored for that time; she looks for the balanceof the last transaction that was performed before the time in question. Semantic assumptionsmay also involve different time granularities. For example; when the user asks for theaccount holder of a certain account in a particular month and account holders are stored interms of days; she assumes that the answer is someone who is the account holder of that …,*,2000,*
Proofs,Claudio Bettini; Sushil Jajodia; X Sean Wang,Proof. We prove that for each pair of time granularities G1 and G2 ; there exist a unique leastupper bound; lub(G1 ;G2 ); and a unique greatest lower bound; glb(G1; G2 ). Before doingthat; we introduce the following notation: Given two nonempty sets 81 and 82 of elements inA; 81 « 82 holds if each number in 81 is strictly less than each number in 82. (Formally; 81 «82 if "Ix E 81 Vy E 82(x <A y).) Moreover; we say that a set S of nonempty sets of elements inA is monotonic if; for each pair of sets 81 and 82 in S; either 81 « 82 or 82 « 81 . It is easily seenthat a time granularity G can be viewed as a monotonic set of nonempty sets of elements inA; namely; {G(i)IG(i) :j:. 0}. On the other hand; a monotonic set S of nonempty sets of …C.

Temporal Mediators: Supporting Uniform Accesses to Heterogeneous Temporal Information,X SEAN WANG; SUSHIL JAJODIA; SONA MOHAVNI,In order to support uniform access to heterogeneous temporal information; we introduce theconcept of a temporal mediator. A temporal mediator consists of three components:(i) arepository for windowing functions and conversion functions;(ii) a time granularity thesaurusand (iii) a query interpreter. There are two types of windowing functions: one associateseach time point to a set of tuples; and the other associates each tuple to a set of time points.A conversion function transforms information in terms of one time granularity into that interms of another time granularity. The time granularity thesaurus stores the knowledge abouttime granularities (eg; names of time granularities and relationships among them). Userspose queries using the windowing functions and in terms of desired time granularities.(Aquery language; which can be used to form such queries; is given in the paper.)

Data Engineering,Eui-Hong Han; George Karypis; Vipin Kumar; Bamshad Mobasher; Claudio Bettini; X Sean Wang; Sushil Jajodia,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) are rapidly evolving areas ofresearch that are at the intersection of several disciplines; including statistics; databases;pattern recognition/AI; optimization; visualization; and high-performance and parallelcomputing. The increased recent attention is primarily because many more people nowhave “databases”. This is turn is driven by two factors: the ever decreasing cost of computersand storage media; and the success of database systems in becoming a mainstay of manyactivities in business; science; and government. With the widespread use of databases andthe explosive growth in their sizes; individuals and organizations are faced with the problemof making use of this data.

Moving towards personalized medicine with fluorescence imaging,Eva Sevick-Muraca; I-Chih Tan; Milton Marshall; Xuejuan Wang; John Rasmussen; Sunkuk Kwon; Kristen Adams; Melissa Aldrich,One of the promises of personalized medicine is the use of highly specific moleculartherapies tailored to the genetic and molecular basis of an individual's disease. While manyconditions are diagnosed by a tissue biopsy; this is not always possible; and diseasemarkers can vary over time or between biopsy locations; as is often the case for cancer.Compared to invasive biopsies; molecular imaging involves the non-invasive administrationof a contrast agent that targets specific disease markers in all tissues in order to track theirexpression during disease progression and therapy. Because disease markers can be seenbelow picomolar tissue concentrations; extremely sensitive imaging techniques are requiredfor personalized diagnoses.

E cient Evaluation of Composite Correlations for Streaming Time Series,Min Wang; X Sean Wang,Abstract. In applications ranging from stock trading to space mission operations; it isimportant to monitor the correlations among multiple streaming time series e ciently in orderto make timely decisions. The challenge is that both the number of streaming time series andthe number of interested correlations can be large. The straightforward way of performingthe evaluation by computing the correlation value for each relevant stream pair at each timeposition is not e cient enough in many situations. In this paper; we introduce an e cientmethod for the case where we need to monitor composite correlations; ie; conjunctions ofhigh correlations among multiple pairs of streaming time series. We use a simplemechanism to predict the correlation values of relevant stream pairs at the next time positionand rank the stream pairs carefully so that the pairs that are likely to have low correlation …,*,*,*

Universita degli Studi di Milano Dipartimento di Informatica e Comunicazione,Sergio Mascetti; Claudio Bettini; X Sean Wang; Dario Freni; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract. Privacy preservation has emerged as a major challenge in ICT. One possiblesolution to enforce privacy is to guarantee anonymity. Indeed; according to the internationalregulations; no restriction is applied in the handling of anonymous data. Consequently; inthe last years the notion of anonymity has been extensively studied by two differentcommunities: Law researchers and professionals that propose definitions of privacyregulations and the Computer Scientists that attempt to provide technical solutions toenforce the legal requirements. In this contribution we address the problem with aninterdisciplinary approach with the objective of enhancing the reciprocal understating andcollaboration between researchers in the two areas. To achieve this; we compare thedifferent notions of anonymity provided in the European data protection Law with the …,*,*,*
