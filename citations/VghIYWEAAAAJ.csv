High-performance complex event processing over streams,Eugene Wu; Yanlei Diao; Shariq Rizvi,Abstract In this paper; we present the design; implementation; and evaluation of a systemthat executes complex event queries over real-time streams of RFID readings encoded asevents. These complex event queries filter and correlate events to match specific patterns;and transform the relevant events into new composite events for the use of externalmonitoring applications. Stream-based execution of these queries enables time-criticalactions to be taken in environments such as supply chain management; surveillance andfacility management; healthcare; etc. We first propose a complex event language thatsignificantly extends existing event languages to meet the needs of a range of RFID-enabledmonitoring applications. We then describe a query plan-based approach to efficientlyimplementing this language.

Fast and memory-efficient regular expression matching for deep packet inspection,Fang Yu; Zhifeng Chen; Yanlei Diao; TV Lakshman; Randy H Katz,Packet content scanning at high speed has become extremely important due to itsapplications in network security; network monitoring; HTTP load balancing; etc. In contentscanning; the packet payload is compared against a set of patterns specified as regularexpressions. In this paper; we first show that memory requirements using traditional methodsare prohibitively high for many patterns used in packet scanning applications. We thenpropose regular expression rewrite techniques that can effectively reduce memory usage.Further; we develop a grouping scheme that can strategically compile a set of regularexpressions into several engines; resulting in remarkable improvement of regularexpression matching speed without much increase in memory usage. We implement a newDFA-based packet scanner using the above techniques. Our experimental results using …,Architecture for Networking and Communications systems; 2006. ANCS 2006.

Path sharing and predicate evaluation for high-performance XML filtering,Yanlei Diao; Mehmet Altinel; Michael J Franklin; Hao Zhang; Peter Fischer,Abstract XML filtering systems aim to provide fast; on-the-fly matching of XML-encoded datato large numbers of query specifications containing constraints on both structure andcontent. It is now well accepted that approaches using event-based parsing and Finite StateMachines (FSMs) can provide the basis for highly scalable structure-oriented XML filteringsystems. The XFilter system [Altinel and Franklin 2000] was the first published FSM-basedXML filtering approach. XFilter used a separate FSM per path query and a novel indexingmechanism to allow all of the FSMs to be executed simultaneously during the processing ofa document. Building on the insights of the XFilter work; we describe a new method; called"YFilter" that combines all of the path queries into a single Nondeterministic Finite Automaton(NFA). YFilter exploits commonality among queries by merging common prefixes of the …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2003,517
Efficient pattern matching over event streams,Jagrati Agrawal; Yanlei Diao; Daniel Gyllstrom; Neil Immerman,Abstract Pattern matching over event streams is increasingly being employed in many areasincluding financial services; RFIDbased inventory management; click stream analysis; andelectronic health systems. While regular expression matching is well studied; patternmatching over streams presents two new challenges: Languages for pattern matching overstreams are significantly richer than languages for regular expression matching.Furthermore; efficient evaluation of these pattern queries over streams requires newalgorithms and optimizations: the conventional wisdom for stream query processing (ie;using selection-join-aggregation) is inadequate. In this paper; we present a formalevaluation model that offers precise semantics for this new class of queries and a queryevaluation framework permitting optimizations in a principled way. We further analyze the …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,406
Yfilter: Efficient and scalable filtering of XML documents,Yanlei Diao; Peter Fischer; Michael J Franklin; Raymond To,Much of the data exchanged over the Internet will soon be encoded in XML; allowing forsophisticated filtering and content-based routing. We have built a filtering engine calledYFilter; which filters streaming XML documents according to XQuery or XPath queries thatinvolve both path expressions and predicates. Unlike previous work; YFilter uses a novelNFA-based execution model. We present the structures and algorithms underlying YFilter;and show its efficiency and scalability under various workloads.,Data Engineering; 2002.

Towards an internet-scale XML dissemination service,Yanlei Diao; Shariq Rizvi; Michael J Franklin,Abstract Publish/subscribe systems have demonstrated the ability to scale to large numbersof users and high data rates when providing content-based data dissemination services onthe Internet. However; their services are limited by the data semantics and queryexpressiveness that they support. On the other hand; the recent work on selectivedissemination of XML data has made significant progress in moving from XML filtering to thericher functionality of transformation for result customization; but in general has ignored thechallenges of deploying such XML-based services on an Internet-scale. In this paper; weaddress these challenges in the context of incorporating the rich functionality of XML datadissemination in a highly scalable system. We present the architectural design of ONYX; asystem based on an overlay network.

Rethinking Data Management for Storage-centric Sensor Networks.,Yanlei Diao; Deepak Ganesan; Gaurav Mathur; Prashant J Shenoy,ABSTRACT Data management in wireless sensor networks has been an area of significantresearch in recent years. Many existing sensor data management systems view sensor dataas a continuous stream that is sensed; filtered; processed; and aggregated as it “flows” fromsensors to users. We argue that technology trends in flash memories and embeddedplatforms call for re-thinking this architecture. We articulate a vision of a storage-centricsensor network where sensor nodes will be equipped with high-capacity and energy-efficient local flash storage. We argue that the data management infrastructure will needsubstantial redesign to fully exploit the presence of local storage and processing capabilityin order to reduce expensive communication. We then describe how StonesDB enables thisvision through a number of innovative features including energyefficient use of flash …,CIDR,2007,181
A platform for scalable one-pass analytics using MapReduce,Boduo Li; Edward Mazur; Yanlei Diao; Andrew McGregor; Prashant Shenoy,Abstract Today's one-pass analytics applications tend to be data-intensive in nature andrequire the ability to process high volumes of data efficiently. MapReduce is a popularprogramming model for processing large datasets using a cluster of machines. However; thetraditional MapReduce model is not well-suited for one-pass analytics; since it is gearedtowards batch processing and requires the data set to be fully loaded into the cluster beforerunning analytical queries.

Lazy-adaptive tree: An optimized index structure for flash devices,Devesh Agrawal; Deepak Ganesan; Ramesh Sitaraman; Yanlei Diao; Shashi Singh,Abstract Flash memories are in ubiquitous use for storage on sensor nodes; mobile devices;and enterprise servers. However; they present significant challenges in designing treeindexes due to their fundamentally different read and write characteristics in comparison tomagnetic disks. In this paper; we present the Lazy-Adaptive Tree (LA-Tree); a novel indexstructure that is designed to improve performance by minimizing accesses to flash. The LA-tree has three key features: 1) it amortizes the cost of node reads and writes by performingupdate operations in a lazy manner using cascaded buffers; 2) it dynamically adapts buffersizes to workload using an online algorithm; which we prove to be optimal under the costmodel for raw NAND flashes; and 3) it optimizes index parameters; memory management;and storage reclamation to address flash constraints.

Query processing for high-volume XML message brokering,Yanlei Diao; Michael Franklin,Abstract XML filtering solutions developed to date have focused on the matching ofdocuments to large numbers of queries but have not addressed the customization of outputneeded for emerging distributed information infrastructures. Support for such customizationcan significantly increase the complexity of the filtering process. In this paper; we show howto leverage an efficient; shared path matching engine to extract the specific XML elementsneeded to generate customized output in an XML Message Broker. We compare threedifferent approaches that differ in the degree to which they exploit the shared path matchingengine. We also present techniques to optimize the post-processing of the path matchingengine output; and to enable the sharing of such processing across queries. We evaluatethese techniques with a detailed performance study of our implementation.,Proceedings of the 29th international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 29,2003,139

The advent of mobileor handheld readers adds significant new challenges to RFID stream processing due to theinherent reader mobility; increased noise; and incomplete data. In this paper; we addressthe problem of translating noisy; incomplete raw streams from mobile RFID readers intoclean; precise event streams with location information. Specifically we propose aprobabilistic model to capture the mobility of the reader; object dynamics; and noisyreadings.

Quality-biased ranking of web documents,Michael Bendersky; W Bruce Croft; Yanlei Diao,Abstract Many existing retrieval approaches do not take into account the content quality ofthe retrieved documents; although link-based measures such as PageRank are commonlyused as a form of document prior. In this paper; we present the quality-biased rankingmethod that promotes documents containing high-quality content; and penalizes low-qualitydocuments. The quality of the document content can be determined by its readability; layoutand ease-of-navigation; among other factors. Accordingly; instead of using a single estimatefor document quality; we consider multiple content-based features that are directly integratedinto a state-of-the-art retrieval method. These content-based features are easy to compute;store and retrieve; even for large web collections. We use several query sets and webcollections to empirically evaluate the performance of our quality-biased retrieval method …,Proceedings of the fourth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2011,92
A comparative study of classification based personal e-mail filtering,Yanlei Diao; Hongjun Lu; Dekai Wu,Abstract This paper addresses personal E-mail filtering by casting it in the framework of textclassification. Modeled as semi-structured documents; E-mail messages consist of a set offields with predefined semantics and a number of variable length free-text fields. While mostwork on classification either concentrates on structured data or free text; the work in thispaper deals with both of them. To perform classification; a naive Bayesian classifier wasdesigned and implemented; and a decision tree based classifier was implemented. Thedesign considerations and implementation issues are discussed. Using a relatively largeamount of real personal E-mail data; a comprehensive comparative study was conductedusing the two classifiers. The importance of different features is reported. Results of otherissues related to building an effective personal E-mail classifier are presented and …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2000,91
Recognizing patterns in streams with imprecise timestamps,Haopeng Zhang; Yanlei Diao; Neil Immerman,Abstract Large-scale event systems are becoming increasingly popular in a variety ofdomains. Event pattern evaluation plays a key role in monitoring applications in thesedomains. Existing work on pattern evaluation; however; assumes that the occurrence time ofeach event is known precisely and the events from various sources can be merged into asingle stream with a total or partial order. We observe that in real-world applications eventoccurrence times are often unknown or imprecise. Therefore; we propose a temporal modelthat assigns a time interval to each event to represent all of its possible occurrence timesand revisit pattern evaluation under this model. In particular; we propose the formalsemantics of such pattern evaluation; two evaluation frameworks; and algorithms andoptimizations in these frameworks.

Complex event patterns involving Kleene closure are finding application in agrowing number of stream applications including financial services; RFID-based inventorymanagement; monitoring in healthcare; etc. While Kleene closure has been well studied forregular expression matching; Kleene closure patterns over streams have unique featuresregarding the event definition; event selection; and termination criteria; which fundamentallydistinguish them from patterns studied in conventional problems.

On complexity and optimization of expensive queries in complex event processing,Haopeng Zhang; Yanlei Diao; Neil Immerman,Abstract Pattern queries are widely used in complex event processing (CEP) systems.Existing pattern matching techniques; however; can provide only limited performance forexpensive queries in real-world applications; which may involve Kleene closure patterns;flexible event selection strategies; and events with imprecise timestamps. To support theseexpensive queries with high performance; we begin our study by analyzing the complexity ofpattern queries; with a focus on the fundamental understanding of which features makepattern queries more expressive and at the same time more computationally expensive. Thisanalysis allows us to identify performance bottlenecks in processing those expensivequeries; and provides key insights for us to develop a series of optimizations to mitigatethose bottlenecks.

Toward learning based web query processing,Yanlei Diao; Hongjun Lu; Songting Chen; Zengping Tian,Abstract In this paper; we describe a novel Web query processing approach with learningcapabilities. Under this approach; user queries are in the form of keywords and searchengines are employed to find URLs of Web sites that might contain the required information.The first few URLs are presented to the user for browsing.

Conditioning and aggregating uncertain data streams: Going beyond expectations,Thanh TL Tran; Andrew McGregor; Yanlei Diao; Liping Peng; Anna Liu,Abstract Uncertain data streams are increasingly common in real-world deployments andmonitoring applications require the evaluation of complex queries on such streams. In thispaper; we consider complex queries involving conditioning (eg; selections and group by's)and aggregation operations on uncertain data streams. To characterize the uncertainty ofanswers to these queries; one generally has to compute the full probability distribution ofeach operation used in the query. Computing distributions of aggregates given conditionedtuple distributions is a hard; unsolved problem.

Spire: Scalable processing of rfid event streams,Richard Cocci; Yanlei Diao; Prashant Shenoy,Abstract—Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is gaining acceptance in anincreasing number of applications for tracking and monitoring purposes. While RFID raisesthe potential to provide unprecedented visibility in various application domains; datamanagement techniques that are capable of handling massive amounts of data generatedby large RFID deployments are still lacking. The sheer volume of data generated in suchdeployments could easily overwhelm existing information systems. Moreover; thetransformation from raw RFID readings into meaningful; actionable information in real-timeposes another significant challenge. In this paper; we present the design of the SPIREsystem that aims to manage enormous volumes of RFID data and provide fast datainformation transformation. In addition; we outline our research plan to refine this design …,Proc. 5th RFID Academic Convocation,2007,9
SEDGE: Symbolic example data generation for dataflow programs,Kaituo Li; Christoph Reichenbach; Yannis Smaragdakis; Yanlei Diao; Christoph Csallner,Exhaustive; automatic testing of dataflow (esp. mapreduce) programs has emerged as animportant challenge. Past work demonstrated effective ways to generate small example datasets that exercise operators in the Pig platform; used to generate Hadoop map-reduceprograms. Although such prior techniques attempt to cover all cases of operator use; inpractice they often fail. Our SEDGE system addresses these completeness problems: forevery dataflow operator; we produce data aiming to cover all cases that arise in the dataflowprogram (eg; both passing and failing a filter). SEDGE relies on transforming the programinto symbolic constraints; and solving the constraints using a symbolic reasoning engine (apowerful SMT solver); while using input data as concrete aids in the solution process.

NFA-based filtering for efficient and scalable XML routing,Yanlei Diao; Hao Zhang; Michael J Franklin,Abstract Soon; much of the data exchanged over the Internet will be encoded in XML. Thisencoding can be used as the basis for sophisticated filtering and content-based routing ofdata using XML queries. Filtering systems such as XFilter represent XML path expressionsas Finite State Machines and index them; In contrast; work on continuous query processingfor database systems has focused on grouping common parts of relational-style queries. It isclear that for scalable and efficient XML filtering and routing both types of techniques will beneeded. We propose a new approach based on Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA) thatindexes path expressions and captures the overlap between queries naturally. Theapproach also has the potential of gracefully handling other problems in this environmentsuch as concurrent filtering and online updates. Preliminary experimental results show …,*,2002,8
AIDE: an automatic user navigation system for interactive data exploration,Yanlei Diao; Kyriaki Dimitriadou; Zhan Li; Wenzhao Liu; Olga Papaemmanouil; Kemi Peng; Liping Peng,Abstract Data analysts often engage in data exploration tasks to discover interesting datapatterns; without knowing exactly what they are looking for. Such exploration tasks can bevery labor-intensive because they often require the user to review many results of ad-hocqueries and adjust the predicates of subsequent queries to balance the tradeoff betweencollecting all interesting information and reducing the size of returned data. In thisdemonstration we introduce AIDE; a system that automates these exploration tasks. AIDEsteers the user towards interesting data areas based on her relevance feedback ondatabase samples; aiming to achieve the goal of identifying all database objects that matchthe user interest with high efficiency. In our demonstration; conference attendees will seeAIDE in action for a variety of exploration tasks on real-world datasets.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,6
Supporting data uncertainty in array databases,Liping Peng; Yanlei Diao,Abstract Uncertain data management has become crucial to scientific applications. Recently;array databases have gained popularity for scientific data processing due to performancebenefits. In this paper; we address uncertain data management in array databases; whichmay involve both value uncertainty within individual tuples and position uncertaintyregarding where a tuple should belong in an array given uncertain dimension attributes. Ourwork defines the formal semantics of array operations under both value and positionuncertainty. To address the new challenge raised by position uncertainty; we propose asuite of storage and evaluation strategies for array operations; with a focus on a newscheme that bounds the overhead of querying by strategically treating tuples with largevariances via replication in storage.

Supporting user-defined functions on uncertain data,Thanh TL Tran; Yanlei Diao; Charles Sutton; Anna Liu,Abstract Uncertain data management has become crucial in many sensing and scientificapplications. As user-defined functions (UDFs) become widely used in these applications;an important task is to capture result uncertainty for queries that evaluate UDFs on uncertaindata. In this work; we provide a general framework for supporting UDFs on uncertain data.Specifically; we propose a learning approach based on Gaussian processes (GPs) tocompute approximate output distributions of a UDF when evaluated on uncertain input; withguaranteed error bounds. We also devise an online algorithm to compute such outputdistributions; which employs a suite of optimizations to improve accuracy and performance.Our evaluation using both real-world and synthetic functions shows that our proposed GPapproach can outperform the state-of-the-art sampling approach with up to two orders of …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,4

The required information is often not contained in the Web pages whose URLs arereturned by a search engine. FACT is capable of navigating in the neighborhood of thesepages to find those that really contain the queried segments. The system does not require aprior knowledge about users such as user profiles [1] or preprocessing of Web pages suchas wrapper generation [2]. A prototype system has been implemented using the approach.

A manual dataexploration process is labor intensive and time-consuming. In the new paradigm of system-aided interactive data exploration; the Database Management System presents the samplesto the user and engages the user in an interactive exploration process to identify the userinterest.

In this emerging distributed infrastructure; XML message brokers will play a key role ascentral exchange points for messages sent between applications and/or users. Users(equivalently; applications; or organizations) subscribe to the message broker by providingprofiles expressing their data interests. After arriving at the message broker; these profilesbecome “standing queries;” which are executed on all incoming data.

In this chapter; we first describe the typical patterns used in packet-scanningapplications and show that for some of these patterns the memory requirements can beprohibitively high when traditional matching methods are used. We then review techniquesfor efficient regular expression matching and explore regular expression rewrite techniquesthat can significantly reduce memory usage.

Initial Sampling for Automatic Interactive Data Exploration,Wenzhao Liu; Yanlei Diao; Anna Liu,In many real world applications; users might not know the queries to send to a database inorder to retrieve data in the user-interested areas. Users can apply a trial and error methodto discover the queries. However; as the data set is usually quite large; the discovery ofqueries will take a long time and the whole process is labor-intensive. We want to build adiscovery-oriented; interactive data exploration system; that guides users to their interesteddata areas through interactive sample labeling process. In each iteration; the system willstrategically select some sample points to present to users for feedback; as relevant orirrelevant; and finally converge to a query that is able to retrieve all the data in the user-interested area.

Interactive data exploration based on user relevance feedback,Kyriaki Dimitriadou; Olga Papaemmanouil; Yanlei Diao,Interactive Data Exploration (IDE) applications typically involve users that aim to discoverinteresting objects by it-eratively executing numerous ad-hoc exploration queries. Therefore;IDE can easily become an extremely labor and resource intensive process. To support theseapplications; we introduce a framework that assists users by automatically navigating themthrough the data set and allows them to identify relevant objects without formulating dataretrieval queries. Our approach relies on user relevance feedback on data samples to modeluser interests and strategically collects more samples to refine the model while minimizingthe user effort. The system leverages decision tree classifiers to generate an effective usermodel that balances the trade-off between identifying all relevant objects and reducing thesize of final returned (relevant and irrelevant) objects.

Exploratory Analytics for RDF Data,Yanlei Diao; Ioana Manolescu,Context: RDF and the Semantic Web The “Web of Data” vision behind the initial World WideWeb project has found its most recent incarnation through the Semantic Web. More andmore data sources are being exported or produced as triples; using the ResourceDescription Format (or RDF; in short) model standardized by the W3C [3]. To exploit thiswealth of data; the SPARQL query language has been defined [4]; and recently enriched tosupport complex querying using regular path expressions; grouping and aggregation etc.RDF graph structure tends to be complex. In a given graph; different resources may havedifferent sets of properties; a given property may have zero; one or several values; resourcesmay or may not have types. This makes it difficult for users to get acquainted with the contentand structure of a large RDF graph.,*,*,*
CLARO: Modeling and Processing of High-Volume Uncertain Data Streams,Thanh Tran; Liping Peng; Boduo Li; Yanlei Diao; Anna Liu,ABSTRACT Uncertain data streams; where data is incomplete; imprecise; and evenmisleading; have been observed in a variety of environments. Feeding uncertain datastreams to existing stream systems can produce results of unknown quality; which is ofparamount concern to monitoring applications. In this paper; we present the Claro systemthat supports uncertain data stream processing for data that is naturally captured usingcontinuous random variables. The Claro system employs a unique data model that is flexibleand allows efficient computation. Built on this model; we develop evaluation techniques forcomplex relational operators; including aggregates and joins; by exploring advancedstatistical theory and approximation techniques. Our evaluation results show that ourtechniques can achieve high performance in stream processing while satisfying accuracy …,*,*,*

Shared Processing for XML Filtering and Customization,Yanlei Diao; Michael J Franklin,ABSTRACT XML is emerging as the common wire format for data. As a result; there recentlyhave been significant advances in XML filtering. To date; solutions have focused onidentifying the queries that match incoming documents; and possibly identifying the specificmatching elements within such documents. These solutions have not; however; addressedthe additional processing required to support the customization of output needed in manyemerging scenarios; such as application integration; web services; and personalizedinformation delivery. This customization can significantly increase the complexity of thematching process. We have developed a system that leverages an efficient; shared; pathmatching engine to extract the specific document components needed to generatecustomized output for large numbers of filtering queries. In this paper; we describe our …,*,*,*

Improved memory management for XML Data Stream Processing,Ravishankar Rajamony; Yanlei Diao,ABSTRACT Running XPath queries on XML documents with minimum memory usage is achallenge. YFilter 1.0 stores the entire document in memory. The extensions to YFilterapplied in [3] are limited as they discuss memory management techniques for a limitedtaxonomy of queries. They do not handle cases where data is being shared betweenqueries. We implemented a basic algorithm which extended [3] to incorporate sharing ofdata among queries. However; this implementation also faced a problem of delayed pruningof data from the memory along with the overhead involved in maintaining additional datastructures. We propose a novel algorithm YCompact which has a buffer manager thathandles pruning of irrelevant information. This is achieved with reduced overhead in termsof data structures. This resulted in significant memory improvement as compared to the …,*,*,*
SPIRE: Efficient Data Interpretation and Compression over RFID Streams,Richard Cocci; Yanming Nie; Yanlei Diao; Prashant Shenoy,Abstract—Despite its promise; RFID technology presents numerous challenges; includingincomplete data; lack of location and containment information; and very high volumes. In thiswork; we present a novel data interpretation and compression substrate over RFID streamsto address these challenges. Our substrate employs a time-varying graph model to efficientlycapture possible object locations and inter-object relationships such as containment fromraw RFID streams. It then employs a probabilistic algorithm to estimate the most likelylocation and containment for each object. By performing such online interpretation; itenables online compression that recognizes and removes redundant information from theoutput stream of this substrate. We have implemented a prototype of our interpretation andcompression substrate and evaluated it using synthetic RFID streams emulating a …,*,*,*
