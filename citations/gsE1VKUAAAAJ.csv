Direct imaging of stochastic domain-wall motion driven by nanosecond current pulses,Guido Meier; Markus Bolte; René Eiselt; Benjamin Krüger; Dong-Hyun Kim; Peter Fischer,Abstract Magnetic transmission x-ray microscopy is used to directly visualize the influence ofa spin-polarized current on domain walls in curved permalloy wires. Pulses of nanosecondduration and of high current density up to 1.0× 10 12 A/m 2 are used to move and to deformthe domain wall. The current pulse drives the wall either undisturbed; ie; as compositeparticle through the wire; or causes structural changes of the magnetization. Repetitive pulsemeasurements reveal the stochastic nature of current-induced domain-wall motion.,Physical review letters,2007,243

Direct observation of stochastic domain-wall depinning in magnetic nanowires,Mi-Young Im; Lars Bocklage; Peter Fischer; Guido Meier,Abstract The stochastic field-driven depinning of a domain wall pinned at a notch in amagnetic nanowire is directly observed using magnetic x-ray microscopy with high lateralresolution down to 15 nm. The depinning-field distribution in Ni 80 Fe 20 nanowiresconsiderably depends on the wire width and the notch depth. The difference in themultiplicity of domain-wall types generated in the vicinity of a notch is responsible for theobserved dependence of the stochastic nature of the domain-wall depinning field on thewire width and the notch depth. Thus the random nature of the domain-wall depinningprocess is controllable by an appropriate design of the nanowire.,Physical review letters,2009,130

Magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements show first a small change in themagnetization due to a reversible rotation of the magnetic spins in the antidot rows; followedby a large change due to reversal of the antidot array columns parallel to the applied field.Employing x-ray photoemission electron microscopy and transmission x-ray microscopy; thelatter irreversible process was observed as a nucleation and propagation of discrete domainchains. The propagating chain ends are blocked by perpendicular chains present in theantidot rows via various mechanisms revealed by micromagnetic simulations.,Physical Review B,2006,98

Symmetry breaking in the formation of magnetic vortex states in a permalloy nanodisk,Mi-Young Im; Peter Fischer; Keisuke Yamada; Tomonori Sato; Shinya Kasai; Yoshinobu Nakatani; Teruo Ono,Abstract The magnetic vortex in nanopatterned elements is currently attracting enormousinterest. A priori; one would assume that the formation of magnetic vortex states shouldexhibit a perfect symmetry; because the magnetic vortex has four degenerate states. Herewe show the first direct observation of an asymmetric phenomenon in the formation processof vortex states in a permalloy nanodisk using high-resolution full-field magnetictransmission soft X-ray microscopy. Micromagnetic simulations confirm that the intrinsicDzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction; which arises from the spin-orbit coupling due to the lackof inversion symmetry near the disk surface; as well as surface-related extrinsic factors; isdecisive for the asymmetric formation of vortex states.,Nature communications,2012,65

Spin‐dependent x‐ray absorption in Co/Pt multilayers,S Rüegg; G Schütz; P Fischer; R Wienke; WB Zeper; H Ebert,Spin‐dependent absorption spectroscopy or circular magnetic x‐ray dichroism studies at theL 2; 3 edges of 5 d atoms in ferromagnetic hosts have been used to investigate the spin‐density distribution of the empty d‐projected states and thus the local magnetic moment ofthe absorbing 5 d atoms. This method was applied to study the average polarization of the Ptatom in Co/Pt multilayers with different modulation lengths. The spin‐dependent absorptionprofiles for vapor‐deposited [25 (4 Å Co+ x Å Pt); x= 9; 16; 23; 30; 40] multilayers indicate asignificant average Pt polarization decreasing with the layer thickness.

Time-resolved imaging of current-induced domain-wall oscillations,Lars Bocklage; Benjamin Krüger; René Eiselt; Markus Bolte; Peter Fischer; Guido Meier,Abstract Current-induced domain-wall dynamics is investigated via high-resolution soft x-raytransmission microscopy by a stroboscopic pump-and-probe measurement scheme at atemporal resolution of 200 ps. A 180 domain wall in a restoring potential of a permalloymicrostructure is displaced from its equilibrium position by nanosecond current pulsesleading to oscillations with velocities up to 325 m/s. The motion of the wall is described withan analytical model of a rigid domain wall in a nonharmonic potential allowing one todetermine the mass of the domain wall. We show that Oersted fields dominate the domain-wall dynamics in our geometry.,Physical Review B,2008,54

Study of in-plane magnetic domains with magnetic transmission X-ray microscopy,P Fischer; T Eimüller; G Schütz; M Köhler; G Bayreuther; G Denbeaux; D Attwood,Magnetic transmission x-ray microscopy is a novel technique to image element specificallymagnetic domain structures. A lateral resolution down to 25 nm is provided by the Fresnelzone plates used as optical elements in soft x-ray microscopy. The magnetic contrast isgiven by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism; ie; large magnetic contributions up to 25% to theabsorption cross section of circularly polarized x rays that occur in the vicinity of; eg; the Fe L3; 2 edges (706 and 719 eV) and depend on the relative orientation of the projection of themagnetization of the sample onto the photon propagation direction. Thus; both in-plane andout-of-plane contributions to the magnetization are accessible. Here we present images ofthe magnetic domain structure of a (3 nm Cr/50 nm Fe/6 nm Cr) thin film system with apreferentially in-plane magnetization recorded at the Fe L edges.

By using the resonant x-ray excitation process and coherent x-rayscattering; we show that linearly polarized soft x rays can be used to image both theamplitude and the phase of magnetic domain structures.

Magnetism in curved geometries,Robert Streubel; Peter Fischer; Florian Kronast; Volodymyr P Kravchuk; Denis D Sheka; Yuri Gaididei; Oliver G Schmidt; Denys Makarov,Abstract Extending planar two-dimensional structures into the three-dimensional space hasbecome a general trend in multiple disciplines; including electronics; photonics; plasmonicsand magnetics. This approach provides means to modify conventional or to launch novelfunctionalities by tailoring the geometry of an object; eg its local curvature. In a genericelectronic system; curvature results in the appearance of scalar and vector geometricpotentials inducing anisotropic and chiral effects. In the specific case of magnetism; even inthe simplest case of a curved anisotropic Heisenberg magnet; the curvilinear geometrymanifests two exchange-driven interactions; namely effective anisotropy and antisymmetricexchange; ie Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya-like interaction. As a consequence; a family of novelcurvature-driven effects emerges; which includes magnetochiral effects and topologically …,Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics,2016,40
Detection of the filarial parasite Mansonella streptocerca in skin biopsies by a nested polymerase chain reaction-based assay.,Peter Fischer; DW Büttner; Jotham Bamuhiiga; Steven A Williams,To differentiate the skin-dwelling filariae Mansonella streptocerca and Onchocerca volvulus;a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed from small amounts ofparasite material present in skin biopsies. One nonspecific and one specific pair of primerswere used to amplify the 5S rDNA spacer region of M. streptocerca. Biopsies with differentmicrofilaria densities obtained from 104 Ugandans living in an area endemic for M.streptocerca were tested using both the nested PCR assay and standard parasitologicassessment of microfilariae. All 82 samples from microfilaria carriers were positive whentested using the nested PCR assay. In addition; M. streptocerca DNA could be detected in16 samples thought to be microfilaria negative. Furthermore; six days following ivermectintreatment; M. streptocerca DNA was found in 12 of 14 microfilaria-negative biopsies …,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,1998,38
Spin-dependence of the rare earth L2; 3 absorption in (RE) 2Co17,P Fischer; G Schütz; G Wiesinger,Abstract Spin dependence of the absorption of x-rays at the L 2; 3-edges of the rare earth(RE) component in the compounds (RE) 2 Co 17 (RE= Ce; Pr; Nd; Sm; Gd; Tb; Ho; Er andTm) has been studied with circularly polarized synchrotron radiation in the energy range of5.7–9.7 keV. The spin-dependent profiles have amplitudes of some percent. The differencesbetween the L 2-and L 3-spin dependence seem to depend on the angular momentum ofthe 4f core. The systematics of the spin dependent L 2; 3 absorption indicate that thecorrelation of the sign of the spin-dependent L 2; 3 absorption and the orientation of the rareearth moment is much more complicated than found for the 5d-impurities in ferromagnetic 3dhosts.,Solid state communications,1990,37
Pinning induced by inter-domain wall interactions in planar magnetic nanowires,TJ Hayward; MT Bryan; PW Fry; PM Fundi; MRJ Gibbs; M-Y Im; P Fischer; DA Allwood,We have investigated pinning potentials created by inter-domain wall magnetostaticinteractions in planar magnetic nanowires. We show that these potentials can take the formof an energy barrier or an energy well depending on the walls' relative monopole moments;and that the applied magnetic fields required to overcome these potentials are significant.Both transverse and vortex wall pairs are investigated and it is found that transverse wallsinteract more strongly due to dipolar coupling between their magnetization structures.Simple analytical models which allow the effects of inter-domain wall interactions to beestimated are also presented.,Applied Physics Letters,2010,36
X-ray imaging of vortex cores in confined magnetic structures,Peter Fischer; Mi-Young Im; Shinya Kasai; Keisuke Yamada; Teruo Ono; André Thiaville,Abstract Cores of magnetic vortices in micron-sized NiFe disk structures; with thicknessesbetween 150 and 50 nm; were imaged and analyzed by high-resolution magnetic soft x-raymicroscopy. A decrease of the vortex-core radius was observed from approximately 38 to 18nm with decreasing disk thickness. By comparing with full three-dimensional micromagneticsimulations showing the well-known barrel structure; we obtained excellent agreement;taking into account instrumental broadening and a small perpendicular anisotropy. Theproven magnetic spatial resolution of better than 25 nm was sufficient to identify a negativedip close to the vortex core; originating from stray fields of the core. Magnetic vortexstructures can serve as test objects for evaluating sensitivity and spatial resolution ofadvanced magnetic microscopy techniques.,Physical review B,2011,33
Investigation of the systematics of CMXD at the L 2; 3 edges in (RE) 2Co17,P Fischer; G Schütz; S Stähler; G Wiesinger,We have performed systematic investigations of the circular magnetic x‐ray dichroism; ie;the spin‐dependent absorption of circularly polarized x rays at the L 2; 3 edges of the 4 felements in the compound (RE) 2Co17. In all systems significant CMXD signals with relativelarge amplitudes of some percent have been found. It is expected; that the spin‐dependentabsorption profile reflects the spin‐density of d‐like unoccupied states at the Fermi level andthus contains information on the orientation of the 4 f moment. The ratio of the CMXD signalat the L 2 and L 3 edges depends strongly on the angular momentum of the 4 f core andindicates in case of Ce2Co17; that the 4 f electrons are of itinerant character with almostquenched angular momentum; as theoretically expected for similar Ce systems.,Journal of Applied Physics,1991,32

Here we demonstrate the visualization and reconstruction of magneticdomain structures in a 3D curved magnetic thin films with tubular shape by means of full-field soft X-ray microscopies. The 3D arrangement of the magnetization is retrieved from aset of 2D projections by analysing the evolution of the magnetic contrast with varyingprojection angle.

Distribution of magnetic moments in Co/Pt and Co/Pt/Ir/Pt multilayers detected by magnetic x‐ray absorption,G Schütz; S Stähler; M Knülle; P Fischer; S Parkin; H Ebert,Circular magnetic x‐ray dichroism (CMXD) was observed at the Pt and Ir L 2; 3 edges in themultilayered structures 25⋅(4 Å Co+ 30 Å Pt) and 25⋅(4 Å Co+ 11 Å Pt+ 8 Å Ir+ 11 Å Pt).The samples were prepared by sputtering and show a large perpendicular anisotropy. Themagnetic absorption at the Pt and Ir L 2; 3 edges was measured in an external magneticfield of 0.15 T perpendicular to the surface. The results indicate a significant spinpolarization of the Pt and Ir layers. By comparison with the corresponding CMXD signals ofPt and Ir impurities in a ferromagnetic iron host we estimated the local spin and orbitalmoments. The results show that the innermost three monolayers in both systems coupleferromagnetically to the Co layers with an average magnetic moment of about 0.01 μ B.,Journal of applied physics,1993,31
Field-and current-induced domain-wall motion in permalloy nanowires with magnetic soft spots,Andreas Vogel; Sebastian Wintz; Theo Gerhardt; Lars Bocklage; Thomas Strache; Mi-Young Im; Peter Fischer; Jürgen Fassbender; Jeffrey McCord; Guido Meier,We study field-and current-induced domain-wall motion in permalloy nanowires containing asquare-shaped magnetically softened region. Implantation of chromium ions is used toinduce pinning sites via a local reduction in the saturation magnetization. Micromagneticsimulations; magnetic transmission soft x-ray microscopy; and electrical measurements areemployed to characterize the pinning potential which significantly differs for transverse andvortex walls.

Tuning of the nucleation field in nanowires with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy,Judith Kimling; Theo Gerhardt; André Kobs; Andreas Vogel; Sebastian Wintz; Mi-Young Im; Peter Fischer; Hans Peter Oepen; Ulrich Merkt; Guido Meier,We report on domain nucleation in nanowires consisting of Co/Pt multilayers withperpendicular magnetic anisotropy that are patterned by electron-beam lithography; sputterdeposition; and lift-off processing. It is found that the nucleation field can be tuned bychanging the geometry of the wire ends. A reduction of the nucleation field by up to 60% isachieved when the wire ends are designed as tips. This contrasts with the behavior of wireswith in-plane anisotropy where the nucleation field increases when triangular-pointed endsare used. In order to clarify the origin of the reduction of the nucleation field; micromagneticsimulations are employed. The effect cannot be explained by the lateral geometricalvariation but is attributable to a local reduction of the perpendicular anisotropy caused byshadowing effects due to the resist mask during sputter deposition of the multilayer.,Journal of Applied Physics,2013,22

X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (X-MCD) was used as a large; element-specificand quantitative magnetic contrast mechanism in the soft X-ray microscopes at BESSY I(Berlin) and the ALS (Berkeley). The present state and potential of magnetic transmission X-ray microscopy (MTXM) is outlined. The possibility to record images in varying magneticfields and the high spatial resolution down to 25 nm were used to image out-of-planemagnetized (4 ÅFe/4 ÅGd)× 75 systems. Magnetic domains could be studied in arrays ofcircular and square dots with lateral dimensions down to 180 nm. Hysteresis loops ofindividual dots were deduced using the direct proportionality of the X-MCD contrast to thesample magnetization.

Influence of interface exchange coupling in perpendicular anisotropy [Pt/Co] 50/TbFe bilayers,S Mangin; Thomas Hauet; P Fischer; DH Kim; JB Kortright; K Chesnel; E Arenholz; Eric E Fullerton,Abstract We present the magnetization evolution of perpendicular anisotropy TbFe and[Co/Pt] 50 thin films either in direct contact resulting in antiferromagnetic interfacial couplingor separated by a thick decoupling Pt layer. Magnetometry and x-ray magnetic circulardichroism spectroscopy determine the spatially averaged magnetic properties. Resonantmagnetic x-ray small-angle scattering and magnetic soft x-ray transmission microscopyprobed the domain configurations and correlations in the reversal processes. While theCo/Pt multilayer reverses by domain propagation; the TbFe magnetization reversal wasdominated either by coherent magnetization reversal processes or by lateral domainformation depending on the interface exchange coupling. In the presence of lateral domains;dipolar field induced domain replication phenomena were observed.,Physical Review B,2008,21
Direct observation of individual Barkhausen avalanches in nucleation-mediated magnetization reversal processes,Mi-Young Im; Peter Fischer; Dong-Hyun Kim; Sung-Chul Shin,We report the scaling behavior of Barkhausen avalanches [H. Barkhausen; Z. Phys. 20; 401(1919).] along the hysteresis loop of a CoCrPt alloy film with perpendicular magneticanisotropy for every field step of 200 Oe. Individual Barkhausen avalanches are directlyobserved via soft x-ray microscopy with a spatial resolution of 15 nm. The Barkhausenavalanches exhibit a power-law scaling behavior; where the scaling exponent of the power-law distribution drastically changes from 1±0.04 to 1.47±0.03 as the applied fieldapproaches the coercivity of the CoCrPt film. We infer that this is due to the coupling ofadjacent domains.,Applied Physics Letters,2009,20

Magnetic X-ray absorption spectroscopy,Cz Kapusta; P Fischer; G Schütz,Abstract Basic principles of the magnetisation dependent effects of the absorption ofcircularly polarised X-rays are discussed. At the inner core absorption edges the effect ismanifested in a difference of absorption coefficients for the right and left circularly polarisedquanta in ferromagnetic media and is called X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). Itoriginates from the interplay of spin orbit interaction in the initial state and angularmomentum conservation in the absorption process and reflects the local spin and orbitalpolarisation of the final states. An outstanding feature of XMCD is the applicability of the so-called 'sum rules' which can be used to determine spin and orbital contributions to the localmagnetic moments separately. Its inherent element selectivity and a high sensitivity makes itespecially useful in a study of technologically important multicomponent materials …,Journal of alloys and compounds,1999,20
Stochastic formation of magnetic vortex structures in asymmetric disks triggered by chaotic dynamics,Mi-Young Im; Ki-Suk Lee; Andreas Vogel; Jung-Il Hong; Guido Meier; Peter Fischer,Abstract The non-trivial spin configuration in a magnetic vortex is a prototype forfundamental studies of nanoscale spin behaviour with potential applications in magneticinformation technologies. Arrays of magnetic vortices interfacing with perpendicular thinfilms have recently been proposed as enabler for skyrmionic structures at room temperature;which has opened exciting perspectives on practical applications of skyrmions. An importantmilestone for achieving not only such skyrmion materials but also general applications ofmagnetic vortices is a reliable control of vortex structures. However; controlling magneticprocesses is hampered by stochastic behaviour; which is associated with thermalfluctuations in general. Here we show that the dynamics in the initial stages of vortexformation on an ultrafast timescale plays a dominating role for the stochastic behaviour …,Nature communications,2014,19
Domain-wall pinning and depinning at soft spots in magnetic nanowires,Andreas Vogel; Sebastian Wintz; Judith Kimling; Markus Bolte; Thomas Strache; Monika Fritzsche; Mi-Young Im; Peter Fischer; Guido Meier; Jürgen Fassbender,The local modification of magnetic properties by ion irradiation opens the possibility tocreate pinning sites for domain walls in magnetic nanowires without geometric constrictions.Implantation of chromium ions into Ni 80 Fe 20 nanowires is used to cause a local reductionof the saturation magnetization Ms and thus a decrease of the energy associated with thedomain wall. Field-driven pinning and depinning of a domain wall at the here so-calledmagnetic soft spots is directly observed using magnetic transmission soft X-ray microscopy.The pinning rate and the depinning field considerably depend on the wire width and thechromium fluence.,IEEE Transactions on Magnetics,2010,19

The field-dependent evolution of sub-100 nm out-of-plane magnetized domains; ie; the transition fromstripe into bubble domains; could be observed in detail. It has been shown that critical fieldslike the bubble collapse field can be described by a wall energy model. Contrary to theassumption of the theory; the magnetization does not remain perpendicular to the film planein all cases. This is only true inside the bubbles.

Magnetic imaging with soft X-ray microscopy,Peter Fischer; Greg Denbeaux; T Eimuller; Dagmar Goll; G Schutz,Recent achievements in magnetic transmission soft X-ray microscopy are reviewed. Themagnetic contrast is given by X-ray magnetic circular dichroism; ie; the dependence of theabsorption coefficient of circularly polarized X-rays on the projection of the magnetization ina ferromagnetic system onto the photon propagation direction.

Magnetic circular x‐ray dichroism studies of Fe/Tb multilayers,K Attenkofer; S Stähler; M Knülle; P Fischer; G Schütz; G Wiesinger; B Scholz,The local magnetic structure of TbFe multilayers with various layer thicknesses of Tb (26 Å)and Fe (10; 20; 30 and 35 Å) has been investigated by circular magnetic x‐ray dichroism(CMXD) studies. From the dichroic signal at the L 3 edge both the local magnetic Tb momentand the anisotropic behavior of the Tb compound could be deduced. The magnetic spectraat the Tb L 2 edge and the Fe K edge; which are known to be sensitive to the local chemicalenvironment; have been used to obtain information on the binding characters of themagnetized atoms in the various TbFe compositions. Significant deviations of the CMXDspectra compared to the corresponding spectra in the pure Fe and Tb metals have beenobserved. This indicates significant contributions to the magnetism from an interface region;whose chemical structure resembles strongly those of the intermetallic TbFe2 compounds.,Journal of applied physics,1993,16
Asymmetric magnetization reversal in dipolarly coupled spin valve structures with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy,M Gottwald; M Hehn; D Lacour; Thomas Hauet; F Montaigne; S Mangin; P Fischer; M-Y Im; A Berger,Abstract Magnetization reversal has been studied in a Co 74 Tb 26/Cu/Co 88 Tb 12 system;which is a perpendicularly magnetized ferrimagnetic bilayer separated by a nonmagneticlayer. The Co 88 Tb 12 (soft) layer (SL) exhibits a switching field much lower than the Co 74Tb 26 (hard) layer (HL); which enabled us to study the magnetization reversal of the SL fordifferent magnetic states of the HL. We found an asymmetric hysteresis loop for the SL; whenthe HL is not fully saturated. Using careful analysis of magnetic force microscopymeasurements we conclude that the asymmetry originates from magnetic domains formed inthe HL that affect the SL reversal. A simple model based on magnetic dipolar interactionbetween the two layers is found to be in good agreement with the experimental data.,Physical Review B,2012,15

Distribution of magnetic moments in Co/Pt and Co/Pt/Ir/Pt multilayers detected by magnetic X-ray absorption,S Stähler; G Schütz; P Fischer; M Knülle; S Rüegg; S Parkin; H Ebert; WB Zeper,Abstract Measurements of the spin-dependent absorption have been performed at the L 2; 3edges in Pt and Ir in the multilayered structures 4ÅCo+ χÅPt (χ= 9; 16; 23; 30; 40) and4ÅCo+ 11ÅPt+ 8ÅIr+ 11ÅPt. The samples were prepared by sputtering and evaporating;respectively; and show a large perpendicular anisotropy. The measured circular magnetic X-ray dichroism (CMXD) profiles indicate a significant spin polarization of the Pt and the Irinterlayer. The results show that the moments of the Pt interlayers as well as of the innermostIr layers couple ferromagnetically to the Co layers. The experimental findings are comparedwith the magnetic moment distribution for sharp interfaces obtained from linear muffin tinorbital (LMTO) band structure calculations.,Journal of magnetism and magnetic materials,1993,14

This radiation is collected by alarge'(9 mm diameter) fresnelcondenser zone plate which projects light through a pinhole and illuminates the sample. Theradiation transmitted through the sample is then focused and magnified by a high-precisionobjective micro zone plate and recorded by a soft x-ray CCD camera. Our condenser zoneplate and pinhole combination serves ad our adjustable monochromator for selecting thedesired photon energy; giving us a (lambda)/(Delta)(lambda) of 700.

Toward sub-10-nm resolution zone plates using the overlay nanofabrication processes,Weilun Chao; Erik H Anderson; Peter Fischer; Dong-Hyun Kim,Soft x-ray zone plate microscopy has proven to be a valuable imaging technique fornanoscale studies. It complements nano-analytic techniques such as electron and scanningprobe microscopies. One of its key features is high spatial resolution. We developed anoverlay nanofabrication process which allows zone plates of sub-20 nm zone widths to befabricated. Zone plates of 15 nm outer zones were successfully realized using this process;and sub-15 nm resolution was achieved with these zone plates. We extend the overlayprocess to fabricating zone plates of 12 nm outer zones; which is expected to achieve 10 nmresolution. In addition; we have identified a pathway to realizing sub-10 nm resolution; highefficiency zone plates with tilted zones using the overlay process.,Advanced Fabrication Technologies for Micro/Nano Optics and Photonics,2008,11

Magnetic domains and magnetization reversal of ion-induced magnetically patterned Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida-coupled Ni 81 Fe 19∕ Ru∕ Co 90 Fe 10 films,J Fassbender; L Bischoff; R Mattheis; P Fischer,Pure magnetic patterning by means of ion-beam irradiation of magnetic thin films andmultilayers often results from a postdeposition local modification of the interface structurewith only minor effects on the film topography. In the study presented here a 60 keV fine-focused Co ion beam was used to change the coupling in a Ni 81 Fe 19∕ Ru∕ Co 90 Fe 10structure from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic on a micron scale. Thereby an artificialstructure with locally varying interlayer exchange coupling and therefore magnetizationalignment is produced. High-resolution full-field x-ray microscopy is used to determine themagnetic domain configuration during the magnetization reversal process locally and layerresolved due to the element-specific contrast in circular x-ray dichroism.

Long-lasting reduction of Brugia timori microfilariae following a single dose of diethylcarbamazine combined with albendazole,Peter Fischer; Yenny Djuardi; Is S Ismid; Paul Rückert; Mark Bradley; Taniawati Supali,Abstract The long-term effect of a single oral dose of 6 mg/kg bodyweight ofdiethylcarbamazine (DEC) combined with 400 mg albendazole (ALB) on the microfilariae(mf) of the lymphatic filarial parasite Brugia timori was studied on Alor island; Indonesia fromApril 2001 to April 2002. Before treatment the geometric mean of the mf density in 96infected study subjects was 150 mf/mL night blood (range 1–5696 mf/mL). One year aftertreatment 69 subjects (72%) were mf-negative and the overall geometric mean mf densityreduced to 3 mf/mL (0–2456 mf/mL). The reduction of mf was more pronounced 1 year aftertreatment compared with 6 months after treatment. It can be concluded that a single dose ofDEC+ ALB leads to a long-term and progressive suppression of B. timori mf for at least 1year. Therefore; DEC+ ALB can be recommended as an effective strategy to control B …,Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,2003,11

Temperature dependence of the circular magnetic x‐ray dichroism in the Invar alloy Fe72Pt28,S Stähler; M Knülle; G Schütz; P Fischer; S Welzel‐Gerth; B Buchholz,The method of spin‐dependent absorption has been used to examine the temperaturedependence of the circular magnetic x‐ray dichroism (CMXD) of the (disordered) Invar alloyfcc Fe72Pt28. At the Fe K edge the difference of the transmission for the reversedmagnetization direction was determined with an accuracy of 10− 5. By comparing thedichroic effects at 110 and at 410 K evidence was found for a temperature‐dependentchange of the magnetic absorption profile different from the pure amplitude reduction due tothe reduced magnetization. It indicates a change of the spin splitting in the low‐lyingunoccupied p states. The polarization‐averaged absorption spectrum shows also a smallvariation between 4 and 11 eV above the threshold indicating that the p‐like electron densitydrops when the sample is heated. The experimental CMXD profiles are compared with …,Journal of applied physics,1993,10

Using soft x-raytransmission microscopy we observed the time-averaged dynamic response of a magneticvortex core in a 2 μm diameter; 100 nm thick permalloy (Ni 80Fe20) disk as a function of theamplitude and frequency of an applied RF magnetic field. At lower amplitude fields a singleresonance was observed; but two distinct resonances; above and below the low amplituderesonance frequency; were observed when higher amplitude fields were applied.

Magnetic soft x-ray microscopy of the domain wall depinning process in permalloy magnetic nanowires,Mi-Young Im; Lars Bocklage; Guido Meier; Peter Fischer,Abstract Full-field magnetic transmission x-ray microscopy at high spatial resolution down to20 nm is used to directly observe field-driven domain wall motion in notch-patternedpermalloy nanowires. The depinning process of a domain wall around a notch exhibits astochastic nature in most nanowires. The stochasticity of the domain wall depinningsensitively depends on the geometry of the nanowire such as the wire thickness; the wirewidth; and the notch depth. We propose an optimized design of the nanowire fordeterministic domain wall depinning field at a notch.,Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter,2011,9

After demagnetization;a stable one-dimensional ferromagnetic (FM) stripe domain phase (tiger-tail phase) for athick sample (X= 7) is imaged; while metastable sharp antiferromagnetic domain walls areobserved in the remanent state for a thinner stack sample (X= 6). When applying an externalmagnetic field the sharp domain walls of the thinner sample gradually transform into the FMphase via separate nucleation of many isolated FM domains all along the domain boundary.We present energy calculations that reveal the underlying energetics driving the overallreversal mechanism.,Applied Physics Letters,2008,9
Real space observation of dipolar interaction in arrays of Fe microelements,Markus Bolte; René Eiselt; Guido Meier; Dong-Hyun Kim; Peter Fischer,Square lattice arrays of thin microelements of Fe are investigated by magnetic transmissionx-ray microscopy. The influence of dipole interaction is analyzed by varying the interelementdistance. For comparison isolated elements are prepared on the same sample. Themagnetostatic field caused by interelement interaction leads to a substantial stabilization ofthe elements in the center of the array comparable to the magnetization process previouslyfound by numerical solution of the Landau-Lifshitz equation for magnetic dot arrays.Micromagnetic simulations show that for high field strengths the dipolar interaction iscollinear with the external field while in the low-field regime the strayfields have significantperpendicular components leading to a complex reversal mechanism.,Journal of applied physics,2006,9
Undulation instabilities in laterally structured magnetic multilayers,T Eimüller; M Scholz; P Guttmann; M Köhler; G Bayreuther; G Schmahl; P Fischer; G Schütz,Undulation instabilities of magnetic domains have been observed in nanostructured strips ofa ferromagnetic Fe/Gd multilayer. The novel technique of magnetic transmission x-raymicroscopy; which is based on the x-ray magnetic circular dichroism; was used for imaging.Below a critical magnetic field; sinus-like modulations of the magnetic domains could beobserved. At a higher rate of field induced strain rectangular patterns occur. They seem to becharacteristic for the reduced lateral width of the magnetic system and are in contrast tochevron patterns observed in extended systems. The domain morphologies found indifferent magnetic fields H; and in nanowires of various widths L z; have been summarizedin a H–L z “phase” diagram. An analogy with theoretical predictions for extended systemscould be found.,Journal of applied physics,2002,9

Magnetization dynamics of imprinted non-collinear spin textures,Robert Streubel; Peter Fischer; Martin Kopte; Oliver G Schmidt; Denys Makarov,We study the magnetization dynamics of non-collinear spin textures realized via imprint ofthe magnetic vortex state in soft permalloy into magnetically hard out-of-plane magnetizedCo/Pd nanopatterned heterostructures. Tuning the interlayer exchange coupling betweensoft-and hard-magnetic subsystems provides means to tailor the magnetic state in the Co/Pdstack from being vortex-to donut-like with different core sizes. While the imprinted vortex spintexture leads to the dynamics similar to the one observed for vortices in permalloy disks; thedonut-like state causes the appearance of two gyrofrequencies characteristic of the earlyand later stages of the magnetization dynamics. The dynamics are described using theThiele equation supported by the full scale micromagnetic simulations by taking into accountan enlarged core size of the donut states compared to magnetic vortices.,Applied Physics Letters,2015,8

Magnetic force microscopy and magnetic transmission soft X-ray microscopy are usedto image the core polarizations and the chiralities which are both found to be randomlydistributed. The resonance frequency of vortex-core motion strongly depends on themagnetostatic coupling between the disks. The parameter describing the relativebroadening of the absorption peak observed in the FMR transmission spectra for a givennormalized center-to-center distance between the elements is shown to depend on the sizeof the array.,IEEE Transactions on Magnetics,2011,8

Spin Polarization of PT in Pt/Co Multilayers Studied by X-Ray Absorption,G Schütz; H Ebert; P Fischer; S Rüegg; WB Zeper,The spin-dependent absorption or MXD (Magnetic X-ray Dichroism) for circularly polarized photonsat inner-shell absorption edges supplies a direct experimental element- selective probe for localmagnetic properties [1]-[23]. The spin-dependent absorption spectra; ie the energy-dependentdifference for the absorption of circularly polarized photons in matter; magnetized parallel andantiparallel with respect to the photon spin; is correlated to the spin structure of electronic statesat the Fermi level. In case of 5d impurities in a ferromagnetic iron host it has been verified thata simple correlation between the MXD signal and the local magnetic d-moment exists [14;24].

Quantitative x-ray magnetic circular dichroism mapping with high spatial resolution full-field magnetic transmission soft x-ray spectro-microscopy,MacCallum J Robertson; Christopher J Agostino; Alpha T N'Diaye; Gong Chen; Mi-Young Im; Peter Fischer,The spectroscopic analysis of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD); which serves asstrong and element-specific magnetic contrast in full-field magnetic transmission soft x-raymicroscopy; is shown to provide information on the local distribution of spin (S) and orbital(L) magnetic moments down to a spatial resolution of 25 nm limited by the x-ray optics usedin the x-ray microscope. The spatially resolved L/S ratio observed in a multilayered (Co 0.3nm/Pt 0.5 nm)× 30 thin film exhibiting a strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy decreasessignificantly in the vicinity of domain walls; indicating a non-uniform spin configuration in thevertical profile of a domain wall across the thin film.

Magnetic coupling of vortices in a two-dimensional lattice,D Nissen; D Mitin; O Klein; SSPK Arekapudi; S Thomas; MY Im; P Fischer; M Albrecht,Abstract We investigated the magnetization reversal of magnetic vortex structures in a two-dimensional lattice. The structures were formed by permalloy (Py) film deposition onto largearrays of self-assembled spherical SiO 2-particles with a diameter of 330 nm. We present thedependence of the nucleation and annihilation field of the vortex structures as a function ofthe Py layer thickness (aspect ratio) and temperature. By increasing the Py thickness up to90 nm or alternatively by lowering the temperature the vortex structure becomes more stableas expected. However; the increase of the Py thickness results in the onset of strongexchange coupling between neighboring Py caps due to the emergence of Py bridgesconnecting them. In particular; we studied the influence of magnetic coupling locally by in-field scanning magneto-resistive microscopy and full-field magnetic soft x-ray microscopy …,Nanotechnology,2015,6

The direction of the Oersted field withrespect to the nanowire is varied by the polarity of the voltage pulses as well by thealignment between the stripline and the nanowire. The results show that by using a tiltedstripline and short current pulses domain walls with defined chirality and type can begenerated.,Applied Physics Letters,2014,5
Focused ion beam patterned Fe thin films: A study by selective area Stokes polarimetry and soft x-ray microscopy,PJ Cook; TH Shen; PJ Grundy; M-Y Im; P Fischer; SA Morton; ALD Kilcoyne,A combination of analytical techniques; with special emphasis on selective area Stokespolarimetry; has been used to explore the structural properties and magnetic behavior offocused ion beam patterned Fe thin films under controlled Ga+ ion irradiation. Ion irradiationat doses ranging from 7.7× 1015 to 5.2× 1016 Ga ions cm− 2 did not noticeably alter thechemical properties of the Fe; but changes to the film structure and increased coercivity wereobserved even after the lowest doses.

Depth-resolved soft x-ray photoelectron emission microscopy in nanostructures via standing-wave excited photoemission,F Kronast; R Ovsyannikov; A Kaiser; C Wiemann; S-H Yang; DE Bürgler; R Schreiber; F Salmassi; P Fischer; HA Dűrr; CM Schneider; W Eberhardt; CS Fadley,We extend conventional laterally-resolved soft x-ray photoelectron emission microscopy toprovide depth resolution along the surface normal down to a few angstroms. This isachieved by using standing-wave excitation. The sample is a Ag/Co/Au trilayer; grown on aSi/MoSi 2 multilayer mirror; with the bottom Ag layer in a wedge profile. Tuning the incident x-ray to the mirror Bragg angle sets up a standing x-ray wave field in the multilayer and thetrilayer wedge structure. We demonstrate the resulting depth resolution by imaging thestanding-wave fields as they move through the trilayer wedge structure.,Applied physics letters,2008,5

X-ray magnetic circular dichroism used to image magnetic domains,P Fischer; T Eimüller; R Kalchgruber; G Schütz; G Schmahl; P Guttmann; G Bayreuther,A new technique to image magnetic domain structures has been established by thecombination of the high resolution transmission X-ray microscope (TXM) at BESSY I basedon the zone plate technique with the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (X-MCD) providing ahuge magnetic contrast. A lateral spatial resolution down to 30 nm could be achieved. Basicfeatures of X-MCD are the inherent element-specificity and the potential to gain informationon the local spin and orbital moments of the absorbing species applying magneto-opticalsum rules. Key results at the Fe L3; 2 edges of Fe in a layered GdFe system and at the Co Lsedge of a PtCo layered system demonstrate the potential of this microscopy. The images canbe recorded in varying magnetic fields which allows to study the evolution of magneticdomains within a complete hysteresis loop.,Journal of synchrotron radiation,1999,4

In the honeycomblattice; we observe at remanence an ordered phase of alternating circulations; whereas inthe hexagonal lattice; small regions of alternating lines form. A variation in the edge-to-edgedistance shows that the size of those regions scales with the magnetostatic interaction.Micromagnetic simulations reveal that the patterns result from the formation of flux closurestates during the nucleation process.,Applied Physics Letters,2017,3
Suppression of stochastic pinning in magnetic nanowire devices using “virtual” domain walls,MPP Hodges; MT Bryan; PW Fry; M-Y Im; P Fischer; TJ Hayward,We have investigated the pinning and depinning of “virtual” domain walls in planar magneticnanowires. Such virtual walls are created when a conventional domain wall becomesannihilated at a narrow gap between two segments of a discontinuous nanowire. By usingfocused magneto-optical Kerr effect magnetometry to study the repeatability of theirdepinning; we show that virtual walls exhibit single-mode depinning distributions;characterized by remarkably low; sub-Oersted standard deviations. This is in stark contrastto the depinning of domain walls from conventional notch-shaped defects; which typicallyexhibit multi-mode depinning field distributions spanning tens to hundreds of Oersteds. High-resolution magnetic soft x-ray microscopy measurements are used to reveal that this highlevel of repeatability is the result of a simple mediated-nucleation process; which …,Journal of Applied Physics,2014,3
Planar organic spin valves using nanostructured Ni80Fe20 magnetic contacts,Hadi AlQahtani; Matthew T Bryan; Thomas J Hayward; Matthew P Hodges; M-Y Im; Peter Fischer; Martin Grell; Dan A Allwood,Abstract Planar organic spin valves were fabricated by evaporating organic semiconductorPTCDI-C 13 onto pairs of patterned Ni 80 Fe 20 magnetic nanowires separated by 120 nm.Control over the relative alignment of magnetisation in the nanowires was achieved byincluding a domain wall 'nucleation pad'at the end of one of the wires to ensure a largeseparation in magnetic switching fields. Switching behaviour was investigated by optical andX-ray magnetic imaging. Room temperature organic magnetoresistance of− 0.35% wasobserved; which is large compared to that achieved in vertical spin valves with similarmaterials. We attribute the enhanced performance of the planar geometry to the depositionof the semiconductor on top of the metal; which improves the quality of metal–semiconductorinterfaces compared to the metal-on-semiconductor interfaces in vertical spin valves.,Organic Electronics,2014,3

Bending magnet X-ray polarization modulation for magnetic full field soft X-ray transmission microscopy,Bo-Sun Kang; Peter Fischer; Dong-Hyun Kim; David Attwood; Erik Anderson; Gyuseong Cho,Full field soft X-ray transmission microscopy is a powerful tool to image at high spatialresolution and with element specific magnetic contrast magnetic microstructures in lowdimensional magnetic systems that are currently discussed both for fundamental andapplied studies. Circularly polarized x-rays are required for magnetic X-ray microscopy sinceX-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD); ie; the dependence of the photoabsorption crosssection at element-specific binding energies on the relative orientation between photon spinand magnetic moments serves as the magnetic contrast mechanism.

Micromagnetic simulations enable directcomparison of the experimental results and give additional information which is not directlyaccessible experimentally. As a case study we investigate the stray-field interaction ofmicroelements prepared on thin Si 3 N 4 membranes with magnetic-transmission X-raymicroscopy and magnetic-force microscopy.

SPEXAFS at the L 2; 3 edges of Eu3Fe5O12; Gd and Tb metal and the alloy HoGd,M Knülle; P Fischer; R Frahm; G Schütz; S Stähler,Systematic studies of the magnetic or spin‐dependent EXAFS (SPEXAFS) were performedat the L 2/3 edges of Eu3Fe5O12; Gd and Tb metal and the alloy Ho20Gd80. The magneticabsorption exhibits distinct EXAFS structure; more pronounced than the nonmagneticEXAFS.

Despite the fact that we do not have a direct sense for magnetism;knowledge about the amazing properties of loadstones and their first technical applications;such as the use of compasses; dates back to ancient China. As the magnetic propertiescould not be explained; magnetism was considered to be one of the mystic components innature during the medieval times. A more practical approach to magnetism started with theindustrial revolution where magnetic materials became major components; for example; inthe development of electric motors and generators.

By high-resolution magnetic imagingusing photo-excitation electron microscopy (XPEEM) and magnetometry measurements; thedeflection of the ferromagnet from its equilibrium state is visualized.

Stochastic nature of domain nucleation process in magnetization reversal,Mi-Young Im; S-H Lee; D-H Kim; Peter Fischer; S-C Shin,Whether domain configurations that occur during magnetization reversal processes on ananoscale are deterministic or nondeterministic is both fundamentally of great interest andtechnologically of utmost relevance [1]. However; due to the limited spatial resolution of themicroscopic measurement techniques employed so far; no direct observation on thestochastic behavior of local domain nucleation during magnetization reversal in real spaceat the nanometer scale has yet been reported. In this work; we have investigated astochastic nature of domain nucleation process during magnetization reversal by utilizingmagnetic soft X-ray trasmission microscopy with high spatial resolution of 15 nm [2]. Thesample used in our study is CoCrPt alloy film; which is the promising candidate for high-density perpendicular magnetic recording media. Typical domain configurations of …,*,2007,*

Towards a deeper insight into strongly correlated electron systems-the symbiosis between experiment and theory,Peter Fischer,It is generally accepted that many of the fundamental properties of the solid state–inparticular electronic; magnetic and thermal properties–ultimately depend on electroniccorrelations. Strongly correlated electron systems give rise to metal-insulator transitions;halfmetallicity; heavy fermion systems etc.; all of which are lively topics of research inmodern solid state physics. Scientists are fascinated by the variety of features that solid statematerials exhibit; such as ferromagnetism or superconductivity which challenge afundamental explanation; but have also a huge technological impact. Ferromagneticmaterials can be seen as a prototype of applied nanoscience which everybody experiencesin the form of common ultrahigh density magnetic storage media.

The amorphous magnetic material is depositedby electron beam evaporation onto a polyimid substrate exhibiting a pronouncedperpendicular magnetic anisotropy.

Observation of thermomagnetically recorded domains with high-resolution magnetic soft x-ray microscopy,S Tsunashima; Nayuki Takagi; Atushi Yamaguchi; Minoru Kume; P Fischer; M Kumazawa,Magnetic domains were thermomagnetically recorded on TbFeCo films using laser pulsedmagnetic field modulation (LP-MFM) and light intensity modulation (LIM). The domains wereobserved with high resolution magnetic transmission X-ray microscopy (M-TXM) before andafter the heat treatment in order to clarify the recording characteristics and the thermalstability of recorded domains. From the results of M-TXM images; it was found that isolatedsingle marks whose lengths are much smaller than 100 nm can be recorded by LP-MFM buttheir mark lengths become often longer than designed.

The compounds belong to the family of the „colossalmagnetoresistive “(CMR) materials which exhibit a huge decrease of their electricalresistivity at the applied magnetic field in the vicinity of their magnetic ordering temperatures.The double exchange interaction (DE); which couples parallel the adjacent Mn3+ and Mn4+spins with a fast hopping hole (electron) gives rise to ferromagnetism and a „metallic“conductivity below TC. The stoichiometry La0. 67Ca0. 33MnO3 corresponds to the highestmagnetic ordering temperature TC of 270 K in the La-Ca system.

High resolution imaging of magnetic domains in TbFeCo MO disks with M-TXM at XM-1,P Fischer; T Eimüller; G Schütz; S Tsunashima; M Kumazawa; N Takagi; GP Denbeaux; AE Lucero; DT Attwood,Nowadays the magnetism in systems of low dimensionality as ultrathin magnetic films;multilayers or magnetic nanostructures attracts increasing interest in technologicalapplications like current developments in information storage technology as magneto-optics;the use of GMR/CMR based read-out technologies; magnetic sensors or magneto-electronics (MRAM) combining semiconductor physics and magnetism. In all these fieldsthere is a rapid decrease of the relevant length scales of the magnetic structures down to thesub-100nm range. However; serious questions arise about the physical limitation in theminiaturisation process or the relation between the observed or tailored macroscopicbehaviour and the microscopic domain structure. A variety of techniques to image magneticdomains have been developed in the past including both electron (eg SEMPA; Lorentz …,*,*,*
Magnetic soft X-ray spectromicroscopy: From nanoscale behavior to mesoscale phenomena,Peter Fischer,Over the last decade magnetism research focused on a fundamental understanding andcontrolling spins on a nanoscale. Recently; it has been recognized; that the next stepbeyond the nanoscale will be governed by mesoscale phenomena [1]; since those aresupposed to add complexity and functionality; which are essential parameters to meet futurechallenges in terms of speed; size and energy efficiency of spin driven devices. Thedevelopment and application of multidimensional visualization techniques; such astomographic magnetic imaging and investigations of fast and ultrafast spin dynamics downto fundamental magnetic length and time scales with elemental sensitivity in emerging multi-component materials will be crucial to achieve mesoscience goals.

Report HE830: Imaging of Magnetic Domains in GdFe systems at ID21,Peter Fischer,Results As this was the first experiment on magnetic imaging on ID21 several commisioningtasks had to be handled. a) Undulator/Ring As the helical undulator (HU52) was operatingfor the first time for user experiments; the parameters of the required gaps to obtain circularlypolarized light had to be determined. There is an asymmetric field distribution between x-and z-magnet arrays. Gap scans in x-and z-direction were performed and gave optimumvalues of x= 9.6 mm and z= 13.5 mm. The encoder of the undulator allowed only values upto±12.46 mm. A direct proof of the emission of circularly polarized light by detecting the X-MCD effect could not be obtained. Beam instabilities that occurred during that period fromtime to time did not allow accurate spectroscopic scans; which even could not be removedby proper normalization procedure. This might be due to angular deviations of the beam.,*,*,*
X-ray imaging the dynamics of nanoscale spin structures,Peter Fischer,Magnetism is one of the dominant physical phenomena used in modern technology; such asfor magnetic storage and sensing. Although known since ancient times; its fundamentalprinciples are still not fully understood. At the beginning of the 20th century; the electron spin(and its quantum-mechanical behavior) was identified as the basic quantity definingmagnetism. Nanomagnetism aims to understand and tailor magnetic properties down tofundamental length and time scales; which are defined by the strengths of competinginteractions between the spins (such as exchange and anisotropy). Spin electronicsconsiders the spin as the new degree of freedom. Novel ways to manipulate spins onnanoscales; such as through spin currents; electric; or photonic control are currently beingexplored. 1 Synthesis of advanced magnetic materials involves elemental composition in …,*,*,*

Materials Science and Engineering Seminar Series,Peter Fischer,The manipulation of spins on the nanoscale is of both fundamental and technologicalinterest. Advances in synthesis of magnetic nanostructures and analytical tools are key toprovide a fundamental insight into the physical processes involved. Magnetic microscopiesare faced with the challenge to provide both spatial resolution in the nanometer regime; atime resolution on a ps to fs scale and elemental specificity to be able to study novelmulticomponent and multifunctional magnetic nanostructures and their ultrafast spindynamics. Magnetic soft X-ray microscopy is a unique analytical technique combining X-raymagnetic circular dichroism (X-MCD) as element specific magnetic contrast mechanism withhigh spatial and temporal resolution. Fresnel zone plates used as X-ray optical elementsprovide a spatial resolution down to currently 10nm [1; 2] thus approaching fundamental …,*,*,*

Soft X-Ray Imaging of spin dynamics at high spatial and temporal resolution,Peter Fischer; Dong-Hyun Kim; Brooke L Mesler; Erik H Anderson; Weilun Chao,Studies of ultrafast spin dynamics are of both fundamental and technological interest.Combining magnetic soft X-ray microscopy which is capable of providing a spatial resolutionin the near-10 nanometer regime with the inherent time structure of current synchrotronsources allowing for a time resolution on a sub-70ps scale provides a unique opportunity toaddress spin dynamics in nanosize magnetic structures; such as studies of vortex dynamicsor spin current induced phenomena in nanowires. The full field soft x-ray microscope; XM1;at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) shown in Fig 1 has been upgraded to allow for timeresolved studies during the “two bunch” operational mode in order to meet these challenges.Due to the limited number of photons per electron bunch which is not sufficient to obtainsnapshot single images a stroboscopic pump and probe scheme is used (Fig. 2).

Imaging magnetic nanostructures with soft X-ray microscopy at the XM-1,P Fischer; T Eimüller; G Schütz; G Bayreuther; S Tsunashima; N Takagi; G Denbeaux; A Pearson; W Bates; M LeGros; D Attwood,The occurence of magnetic domains on a sub-micrometer length scale is intimately relatedwith fundamental ferromagnetic parameters like exchange and anisotropy constants.Magnetic systems with reduced dimensions as eg multilayered or laterally nanostructuredthin films are furthermore of outstanding technological relevance in current developmentslike magneto-optics; GMR based sensor systems or future devices in MRAM technology. Tostudy both the fundamental physics of ferromagnetism and to understand the functionality ofreal magnetic devices imaging techniques should provide both high lateral resolution on ananometer scale; a large magnetic contrast connected with high sensitivity; a chemicalselectivity and the capability to work in varying applied fields.

A magnetic tunnel junction consisting of a wedge-shaped Fe/MgO bilayer grownon a synthetic Si/Mo multilayer mirror and capped with a protective Al2O3 layer was studiedby observing standingwave-induced modulations of core-level and valence-bandphotoemission intensities; together with magnetic circular dichroism of the Fe2p peaks.Depth-dependent compositional; magnetic and electronic properties of the system weredetermined by analyzing the standing-wave wedge (SWedge) data using x-ray opticaltheoretical calculations.
