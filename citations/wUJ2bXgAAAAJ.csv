Data structures and algorithms,John E Hopcroft; Jeffrey D Ullman,We have expanded that coverage and have added material on algorithms for externalstorage and memory management. As a consequence; this book should be suitable as a textfor a first course on data structures and algorithms. The only prerequisite we assume isfamiliarity with some high-level programming language such as Pascal. We have attemptedto cover data structures and algorithms in the broader context of solving problems usingcomputers. We use abstract data types informally in the description and implementation ofalgorithms. Although abstract data types are only starting to appear in widely availableprogramming languages; we feel they are a useful tool in designing programs; no matterwhat the language.,*,1983,4101

Dynamic itemset counting and implication rules for market basket data,Sergey Brin; Rajeev Motwani; Jeffrey D Ullman; Shalom Tsur,Abstract We consider the problem of analyzing market-basket data and present severalimportant contributions. First; we present a new algorithm for finding large itemsets whichuses fewer passes over the data than classic algorithms; and yet uses fewer candidateitemsets than methods based on sampling. We investigate the idea of item reordering; whichcan improve the low-level efficiency of the algorithm. Second; we present a new way ofgenerating “implication rules;” which are normalized based on both the antecedent and theconsequent and are truly implications (not simply a measure of co-occurrence); and weshow how they produce more intuitive results than other methods. Finally; we show howdifferent characteristics of real data; as opposed by synthetic data; can dramatically affect theperformance of the system and the form of the results.,Acm Sigmod Record,1997,2607
Formal languages and their relation to automata,John E Hopcroft; Jeffrey D Ullman,The study of formal languages constitutes an important subarea of computer science. Thisarea sprang to life around 1956 when Noam Chomsky gave a mathematical model of agrammar in connection with his study of natural languages. Shortly afterwards; the conceptof a grammar was found to be of great importance to the programmer when the syntax of theprogramming language ALGOL was defined by a context-free grammar. This developmentled naturally to syntax-directed compiling and the concept of a compiler compiler. Since thena considerable flurry of activity has taken place; the results of which have related formallanguages and automata theory to such an extent that it is impossible to treat the areasseparately. By now; no serious study of computer science would be complete without aknowledge of the techniques and results from language and automata theory. This book …,*,1969,2314
Implementing data cubes efficiently,Venky Harinarayan; Anand Rajaraman; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract Decision support applications involve complex queries on very large databases.Since response times should be small; query optimization is critical. Users typically view thedata as multidimensional data cubes. Each cell of the data cube is a view consisting of anaggregation of interest; like total sales. The values of many of these cells are dependent onthe values of other cells in the data cube. A common and powerful query optimizationtechnique is to materialize some or all of these cells rather than compute them from raw dataeach time. Commercial systems differ mainly in their approach to materializing the datacube. In this paper; we investigate the issue of which cells (views) to materialize when it istoo expensive to materialize all views. A lattice framework is used to express dependenciesamong views. We present greedy algorithms that work off this lattice and determine a …,Acm Sigmod Record,1996,1960

Protection in operating systems,Michael A Harrison; Walter L Ruzzo; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract A model of protection mechanisms in computing systems is presented and itsappropriateness is argued. The “safety” problem for protection systems under this model isto determine in a given situation whether a subject can acquire a particular right to an object.In restricted cases; it can be shown that this problem is decidable; ie there is an algorithm todetermine whether a system in a particular configuration is safe. In general; and undersurprisingly weak assumptions; it cannot be decided if a situation is safe. Variousimplications of this fact are discussed.,Communications of the ACM,1976,1468

Magic sets and other strange ways to implement logic programs,Francois Bancilhon; David Maier; Yehoshua Sagiv; Jeffrey D Ullman,ABSTRACT Several methods for implementing database queries expressed as logical rulesare given and they are compared for efficiency. One method; called “magic sets;” is ageneral algorithm for rewriting logical rules so that they may be implemented bottom-UP (=forward chaining) in a way that cuts down on the irrelevant facts that are generated. Theadvantage of this scheme is that by working bottom-up; we can take advantage of efficientmethods for doing massive joins. Two other methods are ad hoc ways of implementing“linear” rules; ie; rules where at most one predicate in any body is recursive. These methodsare,Proceedings of the fifth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD symposium on Principles of database systems,1985,1026
Information integration using logical views,Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract A number of ideas concerning information-integration tools can be thought of asconstructing answers to queries using views that represent the capabilities of informationsources.

Worst-case performance bounds for simple one-dimensional packing algorithms,David S.  Johnson; Alan Demers; Jeffrey D.  Ullman; Michael R Garey; Ronald L.

The first-fit algorithm placeseach number; in succession; into the first bin in which it fits. The best-fit algorithm placeseach number; in succession; into the most nearly full bin in which it fits. We show that neitherthe first-fit nor the best-fit algorithm will ever use more than 1710L^*+2 bins. Furthermore; weoutline a proof that; if L is in decreasing order; then neither algorithm will use more than …,SIAM Journal on Computing,1974,935
Universality of data retrieval languages,Alfred V Aho; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract We consider the question of how powerful a relational query language should beand state two principles that we feel any query language should satisfy. We show thatalthough relational algebra and relational calculus satisfy these principles; there are certainqueries involving least fixed points that cannot be expressed by these languages; yet thatalso satisfy the principles. We then consider various extensions of relational algebra toenable it to answer such queries. Finally; we discuss our extensions to relational algebra interms of a new programming language oriented model for queries.,Proceedings of the 6th ACM SIGACT-SIGPLAN symposium on Principles of programming languages,1979,880

The transitive reduction of a directed graph,Alfred V.  Aho; Michael R Garey; Jeffrey D.  Ullman,We consider economical representations for the path information in a directed graph. Adirected graph G^t is said to be a transitive reduction of the directed graph G provided that (i)G^t has a directed path from vertex u to vertex v if and only if G has a directed path fromvertex u to vertex v; and (ii) there is no graph with fewer arcs than G^t satisfying condition (i).Though directed graphs with cycles may have more than one such representation; we selecta natural canonical representative as the transitive reduction for such graphs. It is shown thatthe time complexity of the best algorithm for finding the transitive reduction of a graph is thesame as the time to compute the transitive closure of a graph or to perform Boolean matrixmultiplication.,SIAM Journal on Computing,1972,709
Index selection for OLAP,Himanshu Gupta; Venky Harinarayan; Anand Rajaraman; Jeffrey D Ullman,On-line analytical processing (OLAP) is a recent and important application of databasesystems. Typically; OLAP data is presented as a multidimensional" data cube." OLAPqueries are complex and can take many hours or even days to run; if executed directly onthe raw data. The most common method of reducing execution time is to precompute someof the queries into summary tables (subcubes of the data cube) and then to build indexes onthese summary tables. In most commercial OLAP systems today; the summary tables thatare to be precomputed are picked first; followed by the selection of the appropriate indexeson them. A trial-and-error approach is used to divide the space available between thesummary tables and the indexes. This two-step process can perform very poorly. Since bothsummary tables and indexes consume the same resource-space-their selection should …,Data Engineering; 1997. Proceedings. 13th International Conference on,1997,643
Finding interesting associations without support pruning,Edith Cohen; Mayur Datar; Shinji Fujiwara; Aristides Gionis; Piotr Indyk; Rajeev Motwani; Jeffrey D Ullman; Cheng Yang,Association-rule mining has heretofore relied on the condition of high support to do its workefficiently. In particular; the well-known a priori algorithm is only effective when the only rulesof interest are relationships that occur very frequently. However; there are a number ofapplications; such as data mining; identification of similar Web documents; clustering; andcollaborative filtering; where the rules of interest have comparatively few instances in thedata. In these cases; we must look for highly correlated items; or possibly even causalrelationships between infrequent items. We develop a family of algorithms for solving thisproblem; employing a combination of random sampling and hashing techniques.

The theory of joins in relational databases,Alfred V Aho; Catriel Beeri; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract Answering queries in a relational database often requires that the natural join of twoor more relations be computed. However; the result of a join may not be what one expects. Inthis paper we give efficient algorithms to determine whether the join of several relations hasthe intuitively expected value (is lossless) and to determine whether a set of relations has asubset with a lossy join. These algorithms assume that all data dependencies are functional.We then discuss the extension of our techniques to the case where data dependencies aremultivalued.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1979,514
Principles of optimal page replacement,Alfred V Aho; Peter J Denning; Jeffrey D Ullman,ABSTP~ CT. A formal model is presented for paging algorithms under/-order nonstationaryassumptions about program behavior. When processing a program under paging in a givenmemory; a given paging policy generates a certain (expected) number of page calls; ie; its"cost." Under usual assumptions about memory system organization; minimum cost is alwaysachieved by a demand paging algorithm. The minimum cost for/-order program behaviorassumptions is expressed as a dynamic programming problem whose solution yields anoptimal replacement algorithm. Solutions are exhibited in several 0-order cases of interest.Paging algorithms that implement and approximate the minimum cost are discussed.,Journal of the ACM (JACM),1971,514

First we consider the problem of updatingarbitrary theories by inserting into them or deleting from them arbitrary sentences. Thesolution involves two key ideas when replacing an old theory by a new one we wish tominimize the change in the theory; and when there are several theories that involve minimalchanges; we look for a new theory that reflects that ambiguity. The methodology is alsoadapted to updating databases; where different facts can carry different priorities; and toupdating user views.,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD symposium on Principles of database systems,1983,493
Implementation of logical query languages for databases,Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract We examine methods of implementing queries about relational databases in thecase where these queries are expressed in first-order logic as a collection of Horn clauses.Because queries may be defined recursively; straightforward methods of query evaluationdo not always work; and a variety of strategies have been proposed to handle subsets ofrecursive queries. We express such query evaluation techniques as “capture rules” on agraph representing clauses and predicates. One essential property of capture rules is thatthey can be applied independently; thus providing a clean interface for query-evaluationsystems that use several different strategies in different situations. Another is that there be anefficient test for the applicability of a given rule. We define basic capture rules correspondingto application of operators from relational algebra; a top-down capture rule corresponding …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1985,492
Computing Iceberg Queries Efficiently.,Min Fang; Narayanan Shivakumar; Hector Garcia-Molina; Rajeev Motwani; Jeffrey D Ullman,Many applications compute aggregate functions (such as COUNT; SUM) over an attribute(or set of attributes) to find aggregate values above some specified threshold. We call suchqueries iceberg queries because the number of above-threshold results is often very small(the tip of an iceberg); relative to the large amount of input data (the iceberg). Such icebergqueries are common in many applications; including data warehousing; information-retrieval; market basket analysis in data mining; clustering and copy detection. We proposeefficient algorithms to evaluate iceberg queries using very little memory and significantlyfewer passes over data; as compared to current techniques that use sorting or hashing.

Monotone data flow analysis frameworks,John B Kam; Jeffrey D Ullman,Summary We consider a generalization of Kildall's lattice theoretic approach to data flowanalysis; which we call monotone data flow analysis frameworks. Many flow analysisproblems which appear in practice meet the monotonicity condition but not Kildall's conditioncalled distributivity. We show that the maximal fixed point solution exists for every instance ofevery monotone framework; and that it can be obtained by Kildall's algorithm. However;whenever the framework is monotone but not distributive; there are instances in which thedesired solution—the “meet over all paths solution”—differs from the maximal fixed point.Finally; we show the nonexistence of an algorithm to compute the meet over all pathssolution for monotone frameworks.,Acta Informatica,1977,465
Equivalences among relational expressions,Alfred V.  Aho; Yehoshua Sagiv; Jeffrey D.

This paper studies the equivalence problem for these relationalexpressions; with expression optimization in mind. A matrix; called a tableau; is proposed asa natural representative for the value of an expression. It is shown how tableaux can bemade to reflect functional dependencies among attributes. A polynomial time algorithm ispresented for the equivalence of tableaux that correspond to an important subset ofexpressions; although the equivalence problem is shown to be NP-complete under slightlymore general circumstances.,SIAM Journal on Computing,1979,424

Optimizing joins in a map-reduce environment,Foto N Afrati; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract Implementations of map-reduce are being used to perform many operations on verylarge data. We examine strategies for joining several relations in the map-reduceenvironment. Our new approach begins by identifying the" map-key;" the set of attributes thatidentify the Reduce process to which a Map process must send a particular tuple. Eachattribute of the map-key gets a" share;" which is the number of buckets into which its valuesare hashed; to form a component of the identifier of a Reduce process. Relations have theirtuples replicated in limited fashion; the degree of replication depending on the shares forthose map-key attributes that are missing from their schema. We study the problem ofoptimizing the shares; given a fixed number of Reduce processes.

In another direction; Hecht and Ullman gave a strongupper bound on the number of iterations required for propagation algorithms when the datais represented by bit vectors and depth-first ordering of the flow graph is used. The presentpaper combines the ideas of these two papers by considering conditions under which thebound of Hecht and Ullman applies to the depth-first version of Kildall's general datapropagation algorithm. It is shown that the following condition is necessary and sufficient: Letƒ and g be any two functions which could be associated with blocks of a flow graph; let x bean arbitrary lattice element; and let 0 be the lattice zero. Then (*)(∀ ƒ; g; x)[ƒ g (0)≥ g (0)∧ƒ (x)∧ x]. Then it is shown that several of the particular instances of the techniques Kildall …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),1976,379

The generation of optimal code for arithmetic expressions,Ravi Sethi; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract The problem of evaluating arithmetic expressions on a machine with N≥ 1 generalpurpose registers is considered. It is initially assumed that no algebraic laws apply to theoperators and operands in the expression. An algorithm for evaluation of expressions underthis assumption is proposed; and it is shown to take the shortest possible number ofinstructions. It is then assumed that certain operators are commutative or both commutativeand associative. In this case a procedure is given for finding an expression equivalent to agiven one and having the shortest possible evaluation sequence. It is then shown that thealgorithms presented here also minimize the number of storage references in the evaluation.,Journal of the ACM (JACM),1970,361

This paper discusses the difficulty of optimizing queries based on therelational algebra operations select; project; and join. A matrix; called a tableau; is proposedas a useful device for representing the value of a query; and optimization of queries iscouched in terms of finding a minimal tableau equivalent to a given one. Functionaldependencies can be used to imply additional equivalences among tableaux. Although theoptimization problem is NP-complete; a polynomial time algorithm exists to optimizetableaux that correspond to an important subclass of queries.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1979,344
Scalable techniques for mining causal structures,Craig Silverstein; Sergey Brin; Rajeev Motwani; Jeff Ullman,Abstract Mining for association rules in market basket data has proved a fruitful area ofresearch. Measures such as conditional probability (confidence) and correlation have beenused to infer rules of the form “the existence of item A implies the existence of item B.”However; such rules indicate only a statistical relationship between A and B. They do notspecify the nature of the relationship: whether the presence of A causes the presence of B;or the converse; or some other attribute or phenomenon causes both to appear together.

While distinguishing causality from correlation is a trulydifficult problem; recent work in statistics and Bayesian learning provide some avenues ofattack.

We then extend our results to allowarithmetic comparisons in the given query and in the templates.,Proceedings of the fourteenth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1995,339

The circularity problem for a grammar is to determine whether the semantics forall possible sentences (programs) in fact will be well defined. It is proved that this problem is;in general; computationally intractable. Specifically; it is shown that any deterministicalgorithm which solves the problem must for infinitely many cases use an exponentialamount of time. An improved version of Knuth's circularity testing algorithm is also given;which actually solves the problem within exponential time.,Communications of the,1961,323
A simplied universal relation assumption and its properties,Ronald Fagin; Alberto O Mendelzon; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract One problem concerning the universal relation assumption is the inability of knownmethods to obtain a database scheme design in the general case; where the real-worldconstraints are given by a set of dependencies that includes embedded multivalueddependencies. We propose a simpler method of describing the real world; where constraintsare given by functional dependencies and a single join dependency. The relationshipbetween this method of defining the real world and the classical methods is exposed. Wecharacterize in terms of hypergraphs those multivalued dependencies that are theconsequence of a given join dependency.

We clarify the assumptions underlying it and explore the approachessuggested for implementing it. The essential idea of the universal relation model is thataccess paths are embedded in attribute names. Thus attribute names must play unique“roles.” Furthermore; it assumes that for every set of attributes there is a basic relationshipthat the user has in mind. The user's queries refer to these basic relationships rather than tothe underlying database. Two fundamentally different approaches to the universal relationmodel have been taken. According to the first approach; the user's view of the database is auniversal relation or many universal relations; about which the user poses queries.

Bounds on the complexity of the longest common subsequence problem,JD Ullman; AV Aho; DS Hirschberg,Abstract The problem of finding a longest common subsequence of two strings is discussed.This problem arises in data processing applications such as comparing two files and ingenetic applications such as studying molecular evolution. The difficulty of computing alongest common subsequence of two strings is examined using the decision tree model ofcomputation; in which vertices represent “equal-unequal” comparisons. It is shown thatunless a bound on the total number of distinct symbols is assumed; every solution to theproblem can consume an amount of time that is proportional to the product of the lengths ofthe two strings. A general lower bound as a function of the ratio of alphabet size to stringlength is derived. The case where comparisons between symbols of the same string areforbidden is also considered and it is shown that this problem is of linear complexity for a …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),1976,294

Querying semistructured heterogeneous information,Dallan Quass; Anand Rajaraman; Yehoshua Sagiv; Jeffrey Ullman; Jennifer Widom,Abstract Semistructured data has no absolute schema fixed in advance and its structure maybe irregular or incomplete. Such data commonly arises in sources that do not impose a rigidstructure (such as the World-Wide Web) and when data is combined from severalheterogeneous sources. Data models and query languages designed for well structureddata are inappropriate in such environments. Starting with a “lightweight” object modeladopted for the TSIMMIS project at Stanford; in this paper we describe a query languageand object repository designed specifically for semistructured data. Our language providesmeaningful query results in cases where conventional models and languages do not: whensome data is absent; when data does not have regular structure; when similar concepts arerepresented using different types; when heterogeneous sets are present; and when …,International Conference on Deductive and Object-Oriented Databases,1995,274
A query translation scheme for rapid implementation of wrappers,Yannis Papakonstantinou; Ashish Gupta; Hector Garcia-Molina; Jeffrey Ullman,Abstract Wrappers provide access to heterogeneous information sources by convertingapplication queries into source specific queries or commands. In this paper we present awrapper implementation toolkit that facilitates rapid development of wrappers. We focus onthe query translation component of the toolkit; called the converter. The converter takes asinput a Query Description and Translation Language (QDTL) description of the queries thatcan be processed by the underlying source. Based on this the converter decides if anapplication query is (a) directly supported; ie; it can be translated to a query of the underlyingsystem following instructions in the QDTL description;(b) logically supported; ie; logicallyequivalent to a directly supported query;(c) indirectly supported; ie; it can be computed byapplying a filter; automatically generated by the converter; to the result of a directly …,International Conference on Deductive and Object-Oriented Databases,1995,266
Introduction to automata theory; languages; and computation,John E Hopcroft; Rajeev Motwani; Jeffrey D Ullman,In the preface from the 1979 predecessor to thOR book; Hopcroft and U11man marveled atthe fact that the subject of automata had exploded; compared with its state at the time theywrote their first book; in 1969. Truly; the 1979 book contained many topics not found in theearlier work and was about twice its size. If you compare this book with the 1979 book; youwill find that; like the automobiles of the 1970's; this book is" larger on the outside; butsmaller on the inside." That sounds like a retrograde step; but we are happy with thechanges for several reasons. First; in 1979; automata and language theory was still an areaof active research. A purpose of that book was to encourage mathematically inclinedstudents to make new contributions to the field. Today; there is little direct research inautomata theory (as opposed to its applications); and thus little motivation for us to ret~ n …,Acm Sigact News,2001,252
Representative objects: Concise representations of semistructured; hierarchical data,Svetlozar Nestorov; Jeffrey Ullman; Janet Wiener; Sudarashan Chawathe,Introduces the concept of representative objects; which uncover the inherent schema (s) insemi-structured; hierarchical data sources and provide a concise description of the structureof the data. Semi-structured data; unlike data stored in typical relational or object-orienteddatabases; does not have a fixed schema that is known in advance and stored separatelyfrom the data. With the rapid growth of the World Wide Web; semi-structured hierarchicaldata sources are becoming widely available to the casual user. The lack of external schemainformation currently makes browsing and querying these data sources inefficient at best;and impossible at worst. We show how representative objects make schema discoveryefficient and facilitate the generation of meaningful queries over the data.,Data Engineering; 1997.

Flow graph reducibility,Matthew S Hecht; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract The structure of programs can often be described by a technique called “intervalanalysis” on their flow graphs. Here; we characterize the set of flow graphs that can beanalyzed in this way in terms of two very simple transformation on graphs. We then give anecessary and sufficient condition for analyzability and apply it to “goto-less programs;”showing that they all meet the criterion.,Proceedings of the fourth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,1972,235
Query flocks: A generalization of association-rule mining,Dick Tsur; Jeffrey D Ullman; Serge Abiteboul; Chris Clifton; Rajeev Motwani; Svetlozar Nestorov; Arnon Rosenthal,Abstract Association-rule mining has proved a highly successful technique for extractinguseful information from very large databases. This success is attributed not only to theappropriateness of the objectives; but to the fact that a number of new query-optimizationideas; such as the “a-priori” trick; make association-rule mining run much faster than mightbe expected. In this paper we see that the same tricks can be extended to a much moregeneral context; allowing efficient mining of very large databases for many different kinds ofpatterns. The general idea; called “query flocks;” is a generate-and-test model for data-mining problems. We show how the idea can be used either in a general-purpose miningsystem or in a next generation of conventional query optimizers.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1998,234
On notions of information transfer in VLSI circuits,Alfred V Aho; Jeffrey D Ullman; Mihalis Yannakakis,Abstract Several papers have recently dealt with techniques for proving area-time lowerbounds for VLSI computation by “crossing sequence” methods. A number of naturalquestions are raised by these definitions. 1. Is the fooling set approach the most powerfulway to get information-transfer-based lower bounds? We shall show it is not; and offer acandidate for the title “most powerful.” Of course; without a precise definition of “informationtransfer argument;” there could be other contenders. 2. Are the notions of the three paperscited equivalent? We shall exhibit certain inequivalences among the three notions; althoughopen questions remain. However; we can resolve an open question of Papadimitriou andSipser [PS] concerning the relationship between nondeterministic and deterministiccommunication complexity.,Proceedings of the fifteenth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,1983,228
Information integration using logical views,Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract A number of ideas concerning information-integration tools can be thought of asconstructing answers to queries using views that represent the capabilities of informationsources. We review the formal basis of these techniques; which are closely related tocontainment algorithms for conjunctive queries and/or Datalog programs. Then we comparethe approaches taken by AT&T Labs'“Information Manifold” and the Stanford “Tsimmis”project in these terms.,Theoretical Computer Science,2000,223

Translations on a context free grammar,Alfred V Aho; Jeffrey D Ullman,Two schemes for the specification of translations on a context-free grammar are proposed.The first scheme; called a generalized syntax directed translation (GSDT); consists of acontext free grammar with a set of semantic rules associated with each production of thegrammar. In a GSDT an input word is parsed according to the underlying context freegrammar; and at each node of the tree; a finite number of translation strings are computed interms of the translation strings defined at the descendants of that node. The functionalrelationship between the length of input and length of output for translations defined byGSDT's is investigated. The second method for the specification of translations is in terms oftree automata—finite automata with output; walking on derivation trees of a context freegrammar. It is shown that tree automata provide an exact characterization for those …,Information and Control,1971,222
Code generation for expressions with common subexpressions,Alfred V Aho; Stephen C Johnson; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract Easy as the task may seem; many compilers generate rather inefficient code. Someof the difficulty of generating good code may arise from the lack of realistic models forprogramming language and machine semantics. In this paper we show that thecomputational complexity of generating efficient code in realistic situations may also be amajor cause of difficulty in the design of good compilers. We consider the problem ofgenerating optimal code for a set of expressions. If the set of expressions has no commonsub-expressions; then a number of efficient optimal code generation algorithms are knownfor wide classes of machines [SU; AJ; BL].,Proceedings of the 3rd ACM SIGACT-SIGPLAN symposium on Principles on programming languages,1976,215

Characterizations of reducible flow graphs,Matthew S Hecht; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract It is established that if G is a reducible flow graph; then edge (n; m) is backward (aback latch) if and only if either n= m or m dominates n in G. Thus; the backward edges of areducible flow graph are unique. Further characterizations of reducibility are presented. Inparticular; the following are equivalent:(a) G=(N; E; n 0) is reducible.(b) The “dag” of G isunique.(A dag of a flow graph G is a maximal acyclic flow graph which is a subgraph ofG.)(c) E can be partitioned into two sets E 1 and E 2 such that E 1 forms a dag D of G andeach (n; m) in E 2 has n= m or m dominates n in G.(d) Same as (c); except each (n; m) in E 2has n= m or m dominates n in D.(e) Same as (c); except E 2 is the back edge set of a depth-first spanning tree for G.(f) Every cycle of G has a node which dominates the other nodes ofthe cycle.

On finding lowest common ancestors in trees,Alfred V Aho; John E Hopcroft; Jeffrey D Ullman,Trees in an n-node forest are merged according to instructions in a given sequence; whileother instructions in the sequence ask for the lowest common ancestor of pairs of nodes. Weshow that any sequence of O(n) such instructions can be processed “on-line” in O(n\logn)steps on a random access computer. If we can accept our answer “off-line”; that is; noanswers need to be produced until the entire sequence of instructions has been seen; thenwe may perform the task in O(nα(n)) steps; where α(n) is the very slowly growing inverseAckermann function defined in 14. A third algorithm solves a problem of intermediatecomplexity. We require the answers on-line; but we assume that all tree merging instructionsprecede the information requests. This algorithm requires O(n\log\logn) time. We apply thefirst on-line algorithm to a problem in code optimization; that of computing immediate …,SIAM Journal on computing,1976,202

Maximal objects and the semantics of universal relation databases,David Maier; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract The universal relation concept is intended to provide the database user with asimplified model in which he can compose queries without regard to the underlying structureof the relations in the database. Frequently; the lossless join criterion provides the queryinterpreter with the clue needed to interpret the query as the user intended. However; someexamples exist where interpretation by the lossless-join rule runs contrary to our intuition. Tohandle some of these cases; we propose a concept called maximal objects; which modifiesthe universal relation concept in exactly those situations where it appears to go awry—whenthe underlying relational structure has “cycles.” We offer examples of how the maximalobject concept provides intuitively correct interpretations. We also consider how one mightconstruct maximal objects mechanically from purely syntactic structural information—the …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1983,193

A device called the pushdown assembler is defined; and itis shown capable of performing exactly the syntax-directed translations.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,1969,193

However; efficient implementationof constraint checking is difficult. In this paper we explore techniques for assuring constraintsatisfaction without performing a complete evaluation of the constraints. We considermethods that use only constraint definitions; methods that use constraints and updates; andmethods that use constraints; updates; and “local” data.,Proceedings of the thirteenth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1994,182
Optimizing multiway joins in a map-reduce environment,Foto N Afrati; Jeffrey D Ullman,Implementations of map-reduce are being used to perform many operations on very largedata. We examine strategies for joining several relations in the map-reduce environment.Our new approach begins by identifying the “map-key;” the set of attributes that identify theReduce process to which a Map process must send a particular tuple. Each attribute of themap-key gets a “share;” which is the number of buckets into which its values are hashed; toform a component of the identifier of a Reduce process. Relations have their tuplesreplicated in limited fashion; the degree of replication depending on the shares for thosemap-key attributes that are missing from their schema. We study the problem of optimizingthe shares; given a fixed number of Reduce processes. An algorithm for detecting and fixingproblems where a variable is mistakenly included in the map-key is given.

A simple algorithm for global data flow analysis problems,Matthew S Hecht; Jeffrey D Ullman,A simple; iterative bit propagation algorithm for solving global data flow analysis problemssuch as “available expressions” and “live variables” is presented and shown to be quitecomparable in speed to the corresponding interval analysis algorithm. This comparison isfacilitated by a result relating two parameters of a reducible flow graph (rfg). Namely; if G isan rfg; d is the largest number of back edges found in any cycle-free path in G; and k is thelength of the interval derived sequence of G; then k\geqqd.(Intuitively; k is the maximumnesting depth of loops in a computer program; while d is a measure of the maximum loop-interconnectedness.) The node ordering employed by the simple algorithm is the reverse ofthe order in which a node is last visited while growing any depth-first spanning tree of theflow graph. In addition; a dominator algorithm for an rfg is presented which takes O …,SIAM Journal on Computing,1975,173
Properties of acyclic database schemes,Catriel Beeri; Ronald Fagin; David Maier; Alberto Mendelzon; Jeffrey Ullman; Mihalis Yannakakis,Abstract There is a class of database descriptions; involving one “acyclic” join dependencyand a collection of functional dependencies; and nothing else; that appears powerfulenough to describe most any real-world body of data in relational database terms. Further;this class has many desirable properties. Some properties make operations like updatesand the selection of joins to implement a query over a universal relation especially easy.Other properties of interest were studied by other researchers who described the same classin radically different terms; and found desirable properties in their own contexts. It is thepurpose of this paper to define the class formally; to give its important properties and theequivalences with the other classes mentioned; and to explain the importance of eachproperty.

Parallel complexity of logical query programs,Jeffrey D Ullman; Allen Van Gelder,Abstract We consider the parallel time complexity of logic programs without functionsymbols; called logical query programs; or Datalog programs. We give a PRAM algorithm forcomputing the minimum model of a logical query program; and show that for programs withthe “polynomial fringe property;” this algorithm runs in time that is logarithmic in the inputsize; assuming that concurrent writes are allowed if they are consistent. As a result; the“linear” and “piecewise linear” classes of logic programs are in NC. Then we examineseveral nonlinear classes in which the program has a single recursive rule that is an“elementary chain.” We show that certain nonlinear programs are related to GSM mappingsof a balanced parentheses language; and that this relationship implies the “polynomialfringe property;” hence such programs are in NC Finally; we describe an approach for …,Algorithmica,1988,169

A discussion of the ways NAIL! semanticsdiffers from Prolog is followed by an exposition of the principal ideas in the system design.These points include the partition of predicates into strongly connected components torepresent the structure of recursions and the “capture rule” organization for selecting queryprocessing strategies. Other ideas include the way distinctions between bound and freearguments are capitalized upon and the persistence of previously discovered facts about theway to handle certain queries. We also survey the recent work on the processing ofrecursively defined queries conducted by the NAIL! group and others with similar …,International Conference on Logic Programming,1986,167

Worst-case analysis of memory allocation algorithms,Michael R Garey; Ronald L Graham; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract Various memory allocation problems can be modeled by the following abstractproblem. Given a list A &equil;(&agr; 1; &agr; 2;... &agr; n;) of real numbers in the range (0;1]; place these in a minimum number of “bins” so that no bin holds numbers summing tomore than 1. We let A* be the smallest number of bins into which the numbers of list A maybe placed. Since a general placement algorithm for attaining A* appears to be impractical; itis important to determine good heuristic methods for assigning numbers of bins. Weconsider four such simple methods and analyze the worst-case performance of each; closelybounding the maximum of the ratio of the number of bins used by each method applied to listA to the optimal quantity A*.,Proceedings of the fourth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,1972,165
Bottom-up beats top-down for datalog,Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract We show that for any safe datalog program P 1 and any query Q (predicate of P 1with some bound arguments); there is another safe datalog program P 2 that produces theanswer to Q and takes no more time when evaluated by semi-naive evaluation than when P1 is evaluated topdown.,Proceedings of the eighth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1989,160
Efficient tests for top-down termination of logical rules,Jeffrey D Ullman; Allen Van Gelder,Abstract Considered is the question of whether top-down (Prolog-like) evaluation of a set oflogical rules can be guaranteed to terminate. The NAIL! system is designed to processprograms consisting of logical rules and to select; for each fragment of the program; the bestfrom among many possible strategies for its evaluation. In the context of such a system; it isessential that termination tests be fast. Thus; the “uniqueness” property of logical rules isintroduced. This property is satisfied by many of the common examples of rules and is easilyrecognized. For rules with this property; a set of inequalities; whose satisfaction is sufficientfor termination of the rules; can be generated in polynomial time. Then a polynomial test forsatisfaction of constraints generated by this process is given.,Journal of the ACM (JACM),1988,160

Optimal partial-match retrieval when fields are independently specified,Alfred V Aho; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract This paper considers the design of a system to answer partial-match queries from afile containing a collection of records; each record consisting of a sequence of fields. Apartial-match query is a specification of values for zero or more fields of a record; and theanswer to a query is a listing of all records in the file whose fields match the specified values.A design is considered in which the file is stored in a set of bins. A formula is derived for theoptimal number of bits in a bin address to assign to each field; assuming the probability thata given field is specified in a query is independent of what other fields are specified.Implications of the optimality criterion on the size of bins are also discussed.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1979,153

High-probability parallel transitive-closure algorithms,Jeffrey D Ullman; Mihalis Yannakakis,There is a straightforward algorithm for computing the transitive-closure of an n-node graphin O(\log^2n) time on an EREW-PRAM; using n^3/\logn processors; or indeed withM(n)/\logn processors if serial matrix multiplication in M(n) time can be done. This algorithmis within a log factor of optimal in work (processor-time product); for solving the all-pairstransitive-closure problem for dense graphs. However; this algorithm is far from optimalwhen either (a) the graph is sparse; or (b) we want to solve the single-source transitive-closure problem. It would be ideal to have an NC algorithm for transitive-closure that tookabout e processors for the single-source problem on a graph with n nodes and e\geqqnarcs; or about en processors for the all-pairs problem on the same graph.

System/U: a database system based on the universal relation assumption,Henry F Korth; Gabriel M Kuper; Joan Feigenbaum; Allen Van Gelder; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract System/U is a universal relation database system under development at StandfordUniversity which uses the language C on UNIX. The system is intended to test the use of theuniversal view; in which the entire database is seen as one relation. This paper describesthe theory behind System/U; in particular the theory of maximal objects and the connectionbetween a set of attributes. We also describe the implementation of the DDL (DataDescription Language) and the DML (Data Manipulation Language); and discuss in detailhow the DDL finds maximal objects and how the DML determines the connection betweenthe attributes that appear in a query.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1984,145
Answering queries using limited external query processors,Alon Y Levy; Anand Rajaraman; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract When answering queries using external information sources; the contents of thequeries can be described by views. To answer a query; we must rewrite it using the set ofviews presented by the sources. When the external information sources also have the abilityto answer some (perhaps limited) sets of queries that require performing operations on theirdata; the set of views presented by the source may be infinite (albeit encoded in some finitefashion). Previous work on answering queries using views has only considered the casewhere the set of views is finite. In order to exploit the ability of information sources to answermore complex queries; we consider the problem of answering conjunctive queries usinginfinite sets of conjunctive views. Our first result is that an infinite set of conjunctive views canbe partitioned into a finite number of equivalence classes; such that picking one view from …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,1999,138
Computing capabilities of mediators,Ramana Yerneni; Chen Li; Hector Garcia-Molina; Jeffrey Ullman,Abstract Existing data-integration systems based on the mediation architecture employ avariety of mechanisms to describe the query-processing capabilities of sources. However;these systems do not compute the capabilities of the mediators based on the capabilities ofthe sources they integrate. In this paper; we proposed a framework to capture a rich varietyof query-processing capabilities of data sources and mediators.

Equivalence of relational database schemes,Catriel Beeri; Alberto O Mendelzon; Yehoshua Sagiv; Jeffrey D Ullman,We investigate the question of when two database schemes embody the same information.We argue that this question reduces to the equivalence of the sets of fixed points of theproject-join mappings associated with the two database schemes in question. When datadependencies are given; we need only consider those fixed points that satisfy thedependencies. A polynomial algorithm to test the equivalence of database schemes; whenthere are no dependencies; is given. We also provide an exponential algorithm to handlethe case where there are functional and/or multivalued dependencies. Furthermore; we givea polynomial time test to determine whether a project-join mapping preserves a set offunctional dependencies; and a polynomial time algorithm for equivalence of databaseschemes whose project-join mappings do preserve the given set of functional …,SIAM Journal on Computing,1981,127
Polynomial complete scheduling problems,Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract We show that the problem of finding an optimal schedule for a set of jobs ispolynomial complete even in the following two restricted cases.(1) All jobs require one timeunit.(2) All jobs require one or two time units; and there are only two processors. As aconsequence; the general preemptive scheduling problem is also polynomial complete.These results are tantamount to showing that the scheduling problems mentioned areintractable.,ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review,1973,127
Fast algorithms for the elimination of common subexpressions,Jeffrey D Ullman,Summary We give two algorithms for computing the set of available expressions at entranceto the nodes of a flow graph. The first takes O (mn) isteps on a program flow graph (one inwhich no node has more than two successors); where n is the number of nodes and m thenumber of expressions which are ever computed. A modified version of this algorithmrequires O (n 2) steps of an extended type; where bit vector operations are regarded as onestep. We present another algorithm which works only for reducible flow graphs. It requires O(n log n) extended steps.,Acta Informatica,1973,125

A communication-time tradeoff,Christos H Papadimitriou; Jeffrey D Ullman,We show a nontrivial tradeoff between the communication c and time t required to compute acollection of values whose dependencies form a grid; ie; value (i;j) depends on the values (i-1;j) and (i;j-1). No matter how we share the responsibility for computing the nodes of the n*ngrid among processors; the law (c+n)t=Ω(n^3) must hold. Further; there must be a singlepath through the grid along which there are t communication steps; where (d+1)t=Ω(n^2).Depending on the machine organization; either law may be the more significant.,SIAM Journal on Computing,1987,122
Some results on tape-bounded Turing machines,John E Hopcroft; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract Classes of tape-bounded Turing machines similar to the on-line and off-line Turingmachines; but without the restrictions that each machine halt and be deterministic; arestudied. It is shown that the lower bounds on tape complexity of [1] depend on neither thehalting assumption nor determinism. The existence of a dense hierarchy of complexityclasses likewise does not depend on the halting assumption; and it is shown that below logn tape complexity there exists a dense hierarchy of complexity classes for two-waynondeterministic devices. It is also shown that the complexity classes of one-way;nondeterministic machines below linear large complexity are not closed undercomplementation and are larger that the corresponding deterministic complexity class.,Journal of the ACM (JACM),1969,119
Upper and lower bounds on the cost of a map-reduce computation,Anish Das Sarma; Foto N Afrati; Semih Salihoglu; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract In this paper we study the tradeoff between parallelism and communication cost in amap-reduce computation. For any problem that is not" embarrassingly parallel;" the finer wepartition the work of the reducers so that more parallelism can be extracted; the greater willbe the total communication between mappers and reducers. We introduce a model ofproblems that can be solved in a single round of map-reduce computation. This modelenables a generic recipe for discovering lower bounds on communication cost as a functionof the maximum number of inputs that can be assigned to one reducer. We use the model toanalyze the tradeoff for three problems: finding pairs of strings at Hamming distance d;finding triangles and other patterns in a larger graph; and matrix multiplication. For findingstrings of Hamming distance 1; we have upper and lower bounds that match exactly. For …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,118

Database theory—past and future,Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract We briefly sketch the development of the various branches of database theory. Oneimportant branch is the theory of relational databases; including such areas as dependencytheory; universal-relation theory; and hypergraph theory. A second important branch is thetheory of concurrency control and distributed databases. Two other branches have not in thepast been given the attention they deserve. One of these is “logic and databases;” and thesecond is “object-oriented database systems;” which to my thinking includes systems basedon the network or hierarchical data models. Both these areas are going to be moreinfluential in the future.,Proceedings of the sixth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1987,116

Efficient evaluation of right-; left-; and multi-linear rules,Jeffrey F Naughton; Raghu Ramakrishnan; Yehoshua Sagiv; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract We present an algorithm for the efficient evaluation of a useful subset of recursivequeries. Like the magic sets transformation; the algorithm consists of a rewriting phasefollowed by semi-naive bottom-up evaluation of the resulting rules. We prove that on a widerange of recursions; this algorithm achieves a factor of &Ogr;(n) speedup over magic sets.Intuitively; the transformations in this algorithm achieve their performance by reducing thearity of the recursive predicates in the transformed rules.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1989,113
Flexible relation: An approach for integrating data from multiple; possibly inconsistent databases,Shailesh Agarwal; Arthur M Keller; Gio Wiederhold; Krishna Saraswat,In this work we address the problem of dealing with data inconsistencies while integratingdata sets derived from multiple autonomous relational databases. The fundamentalassumption in the classical relational model is that data is consistent and hence no supportis provided for dealing with inconsistent data. Due to this limitation of the classical relationalmodel; the semantics for detecting; representing; and manipulating inconsistent data have tobe explicitly encoded in the applications by the application developer. In this paper; wepropose the flexible relational model; which extends the classical relational model byproviding support for inconsistent data. We present a flexible relation algebra; whichprovides semantics for database operations in the presence of potentially inconsistent data.Finally; we discuss issues raised for query optimization when the data may be …,Data Engineering; 1995.

A model of statistical database their security,John B Kam; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract Considered here; for a particular model of databases in which only informationabout relatively large sets of records can be obtained; is the question of whether one canfrom statistical information obtain information about individuals. Under the assumption thatthe data in the database is taken from arbitrary integers; it is shown that essentially nothingcan be inferred. It is also shown that when the values are known to be imprecise in somefixed range; one can often deduce the values of individual records.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1977,107
Universal single transition time asynchronous state assignments,Arthur D Friedman; Ronald L Graham; Jeffrey D Ullman,In this paper we consider the problem of deriving upper bounds on the number of statevariables required for an n-state universal asynchronous state assignment (ie; a stateassignment which is valid for any n-state asynchronous sequential function). We willconsider a special class of state assignments called SST assignments which were firstderived by Liu [1] and later extended by Tracey [2]. In these assignments all variables whichmust change in a given transition are allowed to change simultaneously without criticalraces. The best universal bound known so far has been developed by Liu and requires 2so-1 state variables; where S0=[log2n]; n being the number of states; and [x] being the leastinteger> x. We shall show how this bound can be substantially improved. We further showthat; by generalizing the state assignment to allow multiple codings for states; the bounds …,IEEE Transactions on Computers,1969,106

Optimal wiring between rectangles,Danny Dolev; Kevin Karplus; Alan Siegel; Alex Strong; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract We consider the problem of wiring together two parallel rows of points under avariety of conditions. The options include whether we allow the rows to slide relative to oneanother; whether we use only rectilinear wires or arbitrary wires; and whether we can usewires in one layer or several layers. In almost all of these combinations of conditions; we canprovide a polynomial-time algorithm to minimize the distance between the parallel rows ofpoints. We also compare two fundamentally different wiring approaches; where one and twolayers are used. We show that although the theoretical model implies that there can be greatgains for the two-layer strategy; even in cases where no crossovers are required; when weconsider typical design rules for laying out VLSI circuits there is no substantial advantage tothe two-layer approach over the one-layer approach.,Proceedings of the thirteenth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,1981,100

On protection in operating systems,Michael A Harrison; Walter L Ruzzo; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract A model of protection mechanisms in computing systems is presented and itsappropriateness is demonstrated. The “safety” problem for protection systems under ourmodel is to determine in a given situation whether a subject can acquire a particular right toan object. In restricted cases; one can show that this problem is decidable; ie; there is analgorithm to determine whether a system in a particular configuration is safe. In general; andunder surprisingly weak assumptions; one cannot decide if a situation is safe. Variousimplications of this fact are discussed.,ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review,1975,96

Time and tape complexity of pushdown automaton languages,Alfred V Aho; John E Hopcroft; Jeffrey D Ullman,A pushdown store is a list in which information can be accessed only on a last-in first-outprinciple of operation. The use of pushdown stores is an important technique in theconstruction of compilers and other language processing devices. Of particular interest fromboth practical and theoretical considerations is how the time and memory required toprocess a language is functionally related to the length of the input sentence underconsideration. In this paper we consider languages defined by pushdown store systems andwe investigate how much time and memory is needed in order to determine whether anarbitrary input sentence belongs or does not belong to some language in this class.,Information and Control,1968,95

First; we shall taxonomize the varieties of ideasthat are sometimes called the" universal relation assumption." Then; we consider some ofthe arguments pro and con. In some cases; the arguments against were expressedprematurely; and solutions to the problems they expose have since been found. In othercases; the arguments against are simply fallacious. In still other cases; the problems pointedout are real; but simply serve to point out that the advantages of the universal relation are notgotten for free. We shall conclude the paper with a description of the algorithm used tointerpret queries in System/U; and the reasoning behind it.,Proceedings of the 1st ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD symposium on Principles of database systems,1982,93

An approach to a unified theory of automata,John E Hopcroft; Jeffrey D Ullman,An automaton called the balloon automaton is defined. The balloon automaton comes infour varieties; depending on whether the device is deterministic or nondeterministic; andwhether the input head can move in one or two directions. Subsets of the balloon automataof each variety; called closed classes are defined. Almost all the known types of automataare equivalent to some closed class of balloon automata. Properties of closed classes aregiven. For example; whatever the variety; the languages accepted by a closed class areclosed under intersection with a regular set. For a given organization of storage; closedclasses of the four varieties can be defined. These four classes are said to form a family. Aclass may be recursive or not; and the emptiness problem may be solvable or unsolvable.Some surprising relationships exist between the recursiveness and solvability of …,Switching and Automata Theory; 1967.

A comparison between deductive and object-oriented database systems,Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract The author will not pretend to be unbiased in the matter of comparing the deductiveand object-oriented approaches to new database systems; he believes that despite someimportant concepts originating with the object-oriented approach; the deductive family ofsystems will ultimately dominate. We shall explore some of the reasons why the twoapproaches do not mix well. Fortunately; most of the features of object-oriented databasesystems can be incorporated in deductive systems (but not vice-versa). Then we argue thatdeclarativeness is important for at least some of the new applications; and that declarativelanguages cannot be object-oriented in a nontrivial way. We next contrast the approacheswith regard to the way they classify data elements. We close with an examination of theprospects for “classless” data; which is motivated by the prospect of databases where the …,International Conference on Deductive and Object-Oriented Databases,1991,87
Deadlock-free packet switching networks,Sam Toueg; Jeffrey D Ullman,Deadlock states have been observed in existing computer networks; emphasizing the needfor carefully designed flow control procedures (controllers) to avoid deadlocks. Such adeadlock-free controller is readily found if we allow it global information about the overallnetwork state. Generally; this assumption is not realistic; and we must resort to deadlock-freelocal controllers using only packet and node information. We present here several types ofsuch controllers; we study their relationship and give a proof of their optimality with respectto deadlock-free controllers using the same set of local parameters.,SIAM Journal on Computing,1981,87

A central problem is that recursive taskscannot deliver their output only at the end; which makes recovery from failures much morecomplicated than in map-reduce and its nonrecursive extensions. We propose severalalgorithmic ideas for efficient implementation of recursions in the map-reduce environmentand discuss several alternatives for supporting recovery from failures without restarting theentire job.,Proceedings of the 14th international conference on extending database technology,2011,85
Analysis of a simple algorithm for global data flow problems,Matthew S Hecht; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract There is an ordering of the nodes of a flow graph G which topologically sorts thedominance relation and can be found in 0 (edges) steps. This ordering is the reverse of theorder in which a node is last visited while growing any depth-first spanning tree of G.Moreover; if G is reducible; then this ordering topologically sorts the" dag" of G. Thus; for areducible flow graph (rfg) there is a simple algorithm to compute the dominators of eachnode in 0 (edges) bit vector steps. The main result of this paper relates two parameters of anrfg. If G is reducible; d is the largest number of back edges found in any cycle-free path in G;and k is the length of the interval derived sequence of G; then k≥ d. From this result itfollows that there is a very simple bit propagation algorithm (indeed; the obvious one) whichalso uses the above ordering; and is at least as good as the interval algorithm for solving …,Proceedings of the 1st annual ACM SIGACT-SIGPLAN symposium on Principles of programming languages,1973,85
Properties of syntax directed translations,Alfred V.  Aho; Jeffrey D.  Ullman,Translations that can be expressed as generalizations of context free grammars andpushdown automata are defined. The types of translations defined are ordered according topower. For each type; certain necessary conditions that a translation be of that type aregiven. It is shown that T is a simple syntax directed translation if and only if there is a contextfree language L and homomorphisms h 1 and h 2 such that T={(h 1 (w); h 2 (w))‖ w is in L}.Every syntax directed translation with one input symbol and one output symbol can bedefined by a sequential transducer. For every syntax directed translation T; there is aconstant c; such that for all w≠ ε in the domain of T; there exists (w; x) in T; with| x|≤ c| w|. Acontext free language is unambiguous if and only if it is the domain of a translation definedby a deterministic pushdown recognizer (pushdown automation with two input tapes).,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,1969,85
Generating efficient plans for queries using views,Foto N Afrati; Chen Li; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract We study the problem or generating efficient; equivalent rewritings using views tocompute the answer to a query. We take the closed-world assumption; in which views arematerialized from base relations; rather than views describing sources in terms of abstractpredicates; as is common when the open-world assumption is used. In the closed-worldmodel; there can be an infinite number of different rewritings that compute the same answer;yet have quite different performance. Query optimizers take a logical plan (a rewriting of thequery) as an input; and generate efficient physical plans to compute the answer. Thus ourgoal is to generate a small subset of the possible logical plans without missing an optimalphysical plan. We first consider a cost model that counts the number of subgoals in aphysical plan; and show a search space that is guaranteed to include an optimal rewriting …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,84

Enumerating subgraph instances using map-reduce,Foto N Afrati; Dimitris Fotakis; Jeffrey D Ullman,The theme of this paper is how to find all instances of a given “sample” graph in a larger“data graph;” using a single round of map-reduce. For the simplest sample graph; thetriangle; we improve upon the best known such algorithm. We then examine the generalcase; considering both the communication cost between mappers and reducers and the totalcomputation cost at the reducers. To minimize communication cost; we exploit thetechniques of [1] for computing multiway joins (evaluating conjunctive queries) in a singlemap-reduce round. Several methods are shown for translating sample graphs into a union ofconjunctive queries with as few queries as possible. We also address the matter ofoptimizing computation cost.

This paper proposes and evaluates several algorithms forfinding all pairs of elements from an input set that meet a similarity threshold. Thecomputation model is a single MapReduce job. Because we allow only one MapReduceround; the Reduce function must be designed so a given output pair is produced by only onetask; for many algorithms; satisfying this condition is one of the biggest challenges. We breakthe cost of an algorithm into three components: the execution cost of the mappers; theexecution cost of the reducers; and the communication cost from the mappers to reducers.The algorithms are presented first in terms of Hamming distance; but extensions to editdistance and Jaccard distance are shown as well.

Integrating information by outerjoins and full disjunctions,Anand Rajaraman; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract Our motivation is the piecing together of tidbits of information found on the“web” intoa usable information structure. The problem is related to that of computing the naturalouterjoin of many relations in a way that preserves all possible connections among facts.Such a computation has been termed a “full disjunction” by Galindo-Legaria. We are thusled to ask the question of when a full disjunction can be computed by some sequence ofnatural outerjoins. The answer involves a concept of from Fagin[1983] called“~-acyclichypergraphs.” We prove that there is a natural outerjoin sequence producing the fulldisjunction if and only if the set of relation schemes forms a connected;-y-acyclichypergraph.,Proceedings of the fifteenth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1996,76

Weattempt to justify these requirements and show why they are independent assumptions. Nextthe question of what operators on sets play the role of+;− and* for arithmetic languages isexplored; and several theorems allowing us recursively to detect induction variables in aloop are given. It is shown that most of the usual set operations do fit nicely into the theoryand help form induction variables.

Proof-tree transformation theorems and their applications,Raghu Ramakrishnan; Yehoshua Sagiv; Jeffrey D Ullman; Moshe Y Vardi,Abstract For certain sets of logical rules; one can demonstrate that for every proof tree thereis another tree proving the same fact and having a special form. One technique for detectingsuch opportunities is to reduce the question to one of conjunctive-query containment. Amore powerful technique is to test whether one conjunctive query is contained in the infiniteunion of conjunctive queries formed by expanding a set of recursive rules. We discuss twoapplications of these techniques. First; we give tests for commutativity of linear rules. Whenlinear rules commute; we can reduce the complexity of “counting” methods for queryevaluation from exponential to polynomial; commutativity also implies separability in thesense of Naughton. A second application is the discovery of linear rules that are equivalentto given nonlinear rules.,Proceedings of the eighth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1989,75

In thispaper; we study the problem of finding feasible and efficient query plans for mediatorsystems. We consider conjunctive queries on mediators and model the source capabilitiesthrough attribute-binding adornments. We use a simple cost model that focuses on the majorcosts in mediation systems; those involved with sending queries to sources and gettinganswers back. Under this metric; we develop two algorithms for source query sequencing-one based on a simple greedy strategy and another based on a partitioning scheme.

The result has an interpretation for relational databases that theuniversal relations described by acyclic join dependencies are exactly those for which theconnections among attributes are defined uniquely. We also exhibit a relationship betweenthe process of Graham reduction (Graham; 1979) of hypergraphs and the process of tableaureduction (Aho; Sagiv and Ullman; 1979) that holds only for acyclic hypergraphs.,Theoretical Computer Science,1984,70

A model for such a channel will be proposed; and a lower and upperbound on the redundancy necessary to correct a given error rate will be derived. We willconsider the case of single synchronization error correction in detail; and stronger boundswill be derived for that case. We will consider multiple adjacent synchronization errors as aspecial case; and show that the bounds can be tightened in this case as well.,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1967,69

Parallel skyline queries,Foto N Afrati; Paraschos Koutris; Dan Suciu; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract In this paper; we design and analyze parallel algorithms for skyline queries. Theskyline of a multidimensional set consists of the points for which no other point exists that isat least as good along every dimension. As a framework for parallel computation; we useboth the MP model proposed in Koutris and Suciu (2011); which requires that the data isperfectly load-balanced; and a variation of the model in Afrati and Ullman (2010); the GMPmodel; which demands weaker load balancing constraints.

Node listings for reducible flow graphs,Alfred V Aho; Jeffrey D Ullman,K. Kennedy recently conjectured that for every n node reducible flow graph; there is asequence of nodes (with repetitions) of length O (n log n) such that all acyclic paths aresubsequences thereof. Such a sequence would; if it could be found easily; enable one to dovarious kinds of global data flow analyses quickly. We show that for all reducible flow graphssuch a sequence does exist; even if the number of edges is much larger than n. If thenumber of edges is O (n); the node listing can be found in O (n log n) time.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,1976,56

The input/output complexity of transitive closure,Jeffrey D Ullman; Mihalis Yannakakis,Abstract Suppose a directed graph has its arcs stored in secondary memory; and we wish tocompute its transitive closure; also storing the result in secondary memory. We assume thatan amount of main memory capable of holding s “values” is available; and that s liesbetween n; the number of nodes of the graph; and e; the number of arcs. The cost measurewe use for algorithms is the I/O complexity of Kung and Hong; where we count 1 every time avalue is moved into main memory from secondary memory; or vice versa. In the dense case;where e is close to n 2; we show that I/O equal to O (n 3/√ s) is sufficient to compute thetransitive closure of an n-node graph; using main memory of size s. Moreover; it is necessaryfor any algorithm that is “standard;” in a sense to be defined precisely in the paper.Roughly;“standard” means that paths are constructed only by concatenating arcs and …,Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence,1991,55

A note on the efficiency of hashing functions,Jeffrey D Ullman,ABSTRACT. Hashing functions are considered which store data" randomly" in a fixed sizehash table with no auxiliary storage. It is known that if k out of the N locations have beenpreviously filled randomly; then the expected number of locations which must be looked atuntil an empty one is found is 1 qk/(N--kb 1). It is shown that there exist nonrandom hashingfunctions which are more efficient for certain values of k and N. However; it is shown that the1+ k/(N-k+ 1) figure is a" lower bound" on hashing performance in the following sense. If h isany hashing function such that the expected number of trials to insert the (kb 1) st item into atable of size N is C (k; N); and if for some k; C (k; N)< 1+ k/(Nkb 1); then there exists k'< ksuch that C (k'; N)> 1-bk/(N--k 4-1). Finally; it is shown that randomness is a sufficient but notnecessary condition for attainment of the 1 4-k/(N--k-4-1) performance for all k; and a …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),1972,50
Near-optimal; single-synchronization-error-correcting code,J Ullman,A synchronization error is said to occur when either a bit which does not belong is detectedin a channel between bits which were transmitted; or a bit which was transmitted is neverdetected at the output. A block code which corrects a single synchronization error per blockis presented; and it is shown that this code has; at most; three bits more redundancy thanthat of an optimal code for this class of errors. The code has the beneficial property that it ispossible to separate the information positions from the check positions; and an appropriatemethod of encoding is shown.,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1966,50

Minimizing view sets without losing query-answering power,Chen Li; Mayank Bawa; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract The problem of answering queries using views has been studied extensively due toits relevance in a wide variety of data-management applications. In these applications; weoften need to select a subset of views to maintain due to limited resources. In this paper; weshow that traditional query containment is not a good basis for deciding whether or not aview should be selected. Instead; we should minimize the view set without losing its query-answering power. To formalize this notion; we first introduce the concept of “p-containment.”That is; a view set V is p-contained in another view set W; if W can answer all the queriesthat can be answered by V. We show that p-containment and the traditional querycontainment are not related. We then discuss how to minimize a view set while retaining itsquery-answering power. We develop the idea further by considering p-containment of two …,International Conference on Database Theory,2001,44

Nonerasing stack automata,John E.  Hopcroft; Jeffrey D.  Ullman,Abstract The stack automaton has been recently introduced into the literature as a model fora compiler. The stack automaton has a two-way input tape; a finite control and a stack. Thestack is similar to a push-down store; in that writing and erasing occur only at the top.However; the stack head may also move up or down the stack in a read only mode. Here;nonerasing stack automata only; are considered. These are stack automata that never erasea symbol from their stack. It is shown that the deterministic; nonerasing stack automaton isequivalent to a deterministic; off-line Turing machine whose storage tape never growsbeyond n log 2 n cells where n is the length of the input. Also; it is shown that thenondeterministic; nonerasing stack automaton is equivalent to a nondeterministic off-lineTuring machine whose tape never grows beyond n 2 cells.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,1967,44
Foundations of uncertain-data integration,Parag Agrawal; Anish Das Sarma; Jeffrey Ullman; Jennifer Widom,Abstract There has been considerable past work studying data integration and uncertaindata in isolation. We develop the foundations for local-as-view (LAV) data integration whenthe sources being integrated are uncertain. We motivate two distinct settings for uncertain-data integration. We then define containment of uncertain databases in these settings; whichallows us to express uncertain sources as views over a virtual mediated uncertain database.Next; we define consistency of a set of uncertain sources and show intractability ofconsistency-checking. We identify an interesting special case for which consistency-checking is polynomial. Finally; the notion of certain answers from traditional LAV dataintegration does not generalize to the uncertain setting; so we define a corresponding notionof correct answers.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,43
A complete axiomatization for a large class of dependencies in relational datatbases,Fereidoon Sadri; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract Relational database theory has discovered complete axiomatizations for functionaland multivalued dependencies. However; a database design system that makes use ofdependencies declared by the user must deal with some more general kinds ofdependencies than these—at least with embedded multivalued dependencies. Yet noaxiomatization for embedded multivalued dependencies is known. In this paper; we define amore general class of dependencies; called “template dependencies” and give a completeaxiomatization for these. We then discuss the interaction between functional dependenciesand template dependencies.,Proceedings of the twelfth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,1980,43

A general theory of translation,Alfred V.  Aho; John E.  Hopcroft; Jeffrey D.  Ullman,Abstract The concept of a translation is fundamental to any theory of compiling. Formally; atranslation is any set of pairs of words. Classes of finitely describable translations areconsidered in general; from the point of view of balloon automata [17; 18; 19]. A translationcan be defined by a transducer; a device with an input tape and an output terminal. If; withinput x; the string y appears at the output terminal; then (x; y) is in the translation defined bythe transducer. One can also define a translation by a two input tape recognizer. If x and yare placed on the two tapes; the recognizer tells if (x; y) is in the defined translation. One candefine closed classes of transducers and recognizers by:(1) restricting the way in whichinfinite storage may be used (pushdown structure; stack structure; etc.);(2) allowing the finitecontrol to be nondeterministic or deterministic;(3) allowing one way or two way motion on …,Mathematical Systems Theory,1969,42

On the complexity of LR (k) testing,Harry B Hunt III; Thomas G Szymanski; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract The problem of determining whether an arbitrary context-free grammar is a memberof some easily parsed subclass of grammars such as the LR (k) grammars is considered.The time complexity of this problem is analyzed both when k is considered to be a fixedinteger and when k is considered to be a parameter of the test. In the first case; it is shownthat for every k there exists an O (n k+ 2) algorithm for testing the LR (k) property; where n isthe size of the grammar in question. On the other hand; if both k and the subject grammarare problem parameters; then the complexity of the problem depends very strongly on therepresentation chosen for k. More specifically; it is shown that this problem is NP-completewhen k is expressed in unary. When k is expressed in binary the problem is complete fornondeterministic exponential time.

Transitive closure and recursive datalog implemented on clusters,Foto N Afrati; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract Implementing recursive algorithms on computing clusters presents a number of newchallenges. In particular; we consider the endgame problem: later rounds of a recursionoften transfer only small amounts of data; causing high overhead for interprocessorcommunication. One way to deal with the endgame problem is to use an algorithm thatreduces the number of rounds of the recursion. Especially; in an application like transitiveclosure (" TC") there are several recursive-doubling algorithms that use a logarithmic; ratherthan linear; number of rounds. Unfortunately; recursive-doubling algorithms can deducemany more facts than the linear TC algorithms; which could negate the cost savings from theelimination of the overhead due to the proliferation of small files. We are thus led to considerTC algorithms that; like the linear algorithms; have the unique decomposition property …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2012,35

Code-generation for machines with multiregister operations,Alfred V Aho; Stephen C Johnson; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract Previous work on optimal code generation has usually assumed that the underlyingmachine has identical registers and that all operands fit in a single register or memorylocation. This paper considers the more realistic problem of generating optimal code forexpressions involving single and double length operands; using several models of register-pair machines permitting both single and double word instructions. With register-pairmachines a new phenomenom arises that is not present in optimal code generation forsingle register machines: In an optimal evaluation of an expression it may be necessary tooscillate back and forth between evaluating subexpressions of the expression. A linear-timeoptimal code generation algorithm is derived for a register-pair machine in which allregisters are interchangeable. The algorithm is based on showing that for this model …,Proceedings of the 4th ACM SIGACT-SIGPLAN symposium on Principles of programming languages,1977,32

On Kent's “Consequences of assuming a universal relation”(Technical correspondance),Jeffrey D Ullman,This is a remarkably strong statement; one that could only be justified by a proof that therewere one or more flaws inherent in the concept; flaws that ruled out the use of the idea forany theoretical or practical purpose and that could not be circumvented by any devicewhatsoever; short of rejecting the whole concept. In this note we shall try to indicate why;rather than being a moribund concept; the universal relation idea is an important directionfor database research. The concept leads to systems that free us from logical navigation (therequirement to specify jumps from relation to relation) in the same way that the relationalmodel freed us from physical navigation. We thus have an opportunity to take another leapforward toward systems that are friendly to the user; a leap as great as that fromnonrelational systems to relational ones. However; this step cannot be taken without …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1983,31

We define severalkinds of {\em horizonal} FDs and {\em vertical} FDs; each of which is consistent withconventional FDs when an uncertain relation doesn't contain any uncertainty.

Logical query optimization by proof-tree transformation,Raghu Ramakrishnan; Yehoshua Sagiv; Jeffrey D Ullman; Moshe Y Vardi,Abstract For certain sets of logical rules; one can demonstrate that for every proof tree thereis another tree proving the same fact and having a special “normal” form and therebyestablish several useful properties of programs. Such a demonstration can be carried out intwo parts: first establish that some containment holds between pieces of proof trees; andthen show that repeated application of a transformation based on this containment convertsevery proof tree to the normal form. In this paper; we explore the power of arguments basedon such proof-tree transformations and show that they provide a general tool for programoptimization. We develop techniques to demonstrate useful proof-tree containments andshow how certain program properties can be tested by using these containments in normal-form arguments.

Fragments of relations,David Maier; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract We develop a theory of relations that are constructed by the union and selectionoperations from fragment relations. Algorithms for inserting and deleting from relations thatare composed of physical fragments are discussed; and we show when such insertions anddeletions are meaningful. We also show how to find an access set for a relation; that is; a setof fragments sufficient to produce the relation; and we apply the test to the question of howthe fragmentation of relations interacts with a query on the relation; showing that a selectionon the relation can be implemented by retrieving a set of physical fragments that forms anaccess set for another particular relation.,ACM SIGMOD Record,1983,25
A formal approach to code optimization,Alfred V Aho; Ravi Sethi; JD Ullman,Abstract We examine from a formal point of view some problems which arise in codeoptimization and present some of the results which can come from such an approach.Specifically; a set of transformations which characterize optimization algorithms for straightline code is presented. Then we present an algorithm which produces machine code forevaluating arithmetic expressions on machines with N≥ 1 general purpose registers. Wecan prove that this algorithm produces optimal code when the cost criterion is the length ofmachine code generated.,ACM SIGPLAN Notices,1970,25
A characterization of two-way deterministic of classes languages,Alfred V Aho; Jeffrey D Ullman,It is shown that a class of languages is defined by a class of two-way deterministic balloonautomata if and only if that class is closed under marked union; marked Kleene closure andthe inverse mappings performed by GSM's that move two ways on the input.

Operations on sparse relations,Harry B Hunt III; JD Ullman; TG Szymanski,Abstract Various computations on relations; Boolean matrices; or directed graphs; such asthe computation of precedence relations for a context-free grammar; can be done by apractical algorithm that is asymptotically faster than those in common use. For example; howto compute operator precedence or Wirth-Weber precedence relations in O (n 2) steps isshown; as well as how to compute linear precedence functions in O (n) steps; where n is thesize of a grammar. The heart of the algorithms is a general theorem giving sufficientconditions under which an expression whose operands are sparse relations and whoseoperators are composition; transitive closure; union; and inverse; can be computedefficiently.,Communications of the ACM,1977,24
Vision paper: towards an understanding of the limits of map-reduce computation,Foto N Afrati; Anish Das Sarma; Semih Salihoglu; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract: A significant amount of recent research work has addressed the problem of solvingvarious data management problems in the cloud. The major algorithmic challenges in map-reduce computations involve balancing a multitude of factors such as the number ofmachines available for mappers/reducers; their memory requirements; and communicationcost (total amount of data sent from mappers to reducers). Most past work provides customsolutions to specific problems; eg; performing fuzzy joins in map-reduce; clustering; graphanalyses; and so on. While some problems are amenable to very efficient map-reducealgorithms; some other problems do not lend themselves to a natural distribution; and haveprovable lower bounds. Clearly; the ease of" map-reducability" is closely related to whetherthe problem can be partitioned into independent pieces; which are distributed across …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1204.1754,2012,23
Using views to generate efficient evaluation plans for queries,Foto N Afrati; Chen Li; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract We study the problem of generating efficient; equivalent rewritings using views tocompute the answer to a query. We take the closed-world assumption; in which views arematerialized from base relations; rather than views describing sources in terms of abstractpredicates; as is common when the open-world assumption is used. In the closed-worldmodel; there can be an infinite number of different rewritings that compute the same answer;yet have quite different performance. Query optimizers take a logical plan (a rewriting of thequery) as an input; and generate efficient physical plans to compute the answer. Thus ourgoal is to generate a small subset of the possible logical plans without missing an optimalphysical plan. We first consider a cost model that counts the number of subgoals in aphysical plan; and show a search space that is guaranteed to include an optimal rewriting …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2007,23

Understanding sources of ineffciency in general-purpose chips,Rehan Hameed; Wajahat Qadeer; Megan Wachs; Omid Azizi; Alex Solomatnikov; Benjamin C Lee; Stephen Richardson; Christos Kozyrakis; Mark Horowitz,Abstract Scaling the performance of a power limited processor requires decreasing theenergy expended per instruction executed; since energy/op* op/second is power. To betterunderstand what improvement in processor efficiency is possible; and what must be done tocapture it; we quantify the sources of the performance and energy overheads of a 720p HDH. 264 encoder running on a general-purpose four-processor CMP system. The initialoverheads are large: the CMP was 500 x less energy efficient than an Application SpecificIntegrated Circuit (ASIC) doing the same job. We explore methods to eliminate theseoverheads by transforming the CPU into a specialized system for H. 264 encoding. Broadlyapplicable optimizations like single instruction; multiple data (SIMD) units improve CMPperformance by 14 x and energy by 10x; which is still 50x worse than an ASIC.

Evaluating; combining and generalizing recommendations with prerequisites,Aditya G Parameswaran; Hector Garcia-Molina; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract We consider the problem of recommending the best set of k items when there is aninherent ordering between items; expressed as a set of prerequisites (eg; themovie'Godfather I'is a prerequisite of'Godfather II'). Since this general problem iscomputationally intractable; we develop 3 approximation algorithms to solve this problem forvarious prerequisite structures (eg; chain graphs; AND graphs; AND-OR graphs). We deriveworst-case bounds for these algorithms for these structures; and experimentally evaluatethese algorithms on synthetic data. We also develop an algorithm to combine solutions inorder to generate even better solutions; and compare the performance of this algorithm withthe other three.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,22
Complexity of a top-down capture rule,Yehoshua Sagiv; Jeffrey D Ullman,ABSTRACT Capture rules were introduced in [U] as a method for planning the evaluation ofa query expressed in first-order logic. We examine a capture rule that is substantiated by asimple top-down implementation of restricted Horn clause logic. A necessary and sufficientcondition for the top-down algorithm to converge is shown. It is proved that; provided there isa bound on the number of arguments of predicates; the test can be performed in polynomialtime; however; if the arity of predicates is made part of the input; then the problem ofdeciding whether the top-down algorithm converges is NP-hard. We then considerrelaxation of some of our constraints on the form of the logic; showing that success of the top-down algorithm can still be tested in polynomial time if the number of arguments is limitedand in exponential time if not.,*,1984,22
Experience with a regular expression compiler,Anna R Karlin; Howard W Trickey; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract: The language of regular expressions is a useful one for specifying certainsequential processes at a very high level. They allow easy modification of designs forcircuits; like controllers; that are described by patterns of events they must recognize and theresponses they must make to those patterns. This paper discusses the compilation of suchexpressions into reasonably compact layouts. The translation of regular expressions intonondeterministic automata by two different methods is discussed; along with the advantagesof each method. A major part of the compilation problem is selection of good state codes forthe nondeterministic automata; one successful strategy is explained in the paper.Descriptors:* Compilers;* High level languages; Modification; Automatic; Coding;Sequences; Strategy; Symbols; Methodology; Comparison Subject Categories: Computer …,*,1983,22

Tools for template dependencies,Ronald Fagin; David Maier; Jeffrey D Ullman; Mihalis Yannakakis,Template dependencies (TD's) are a class of data dependencies that include multivaluedand join dependencies and embedded versions of these. A collection of techniques;examples and results about TD's are presented. The principal results are: 1) Finiteimplication (implication over relations with a finite number of tuples) is distinct fromunrestricted implication for TD's. 2) There are; for TD's over three or more attributes; infinitechains of increasingly weaker and increasingly stronger full TD's. 3) However; there areweakest (nontrivial) and strongest full TD's over any given set of attributes. 4) Over twoattributes; there are only three distinct TD's. 5) There is no weakest (not necessarily full) TDover any set of three or more attributes. 6) There is a finite relation that obeys every strictlypartial TD but no full TD. 7) The conjunction of each finite set of full TD's is equivalent to a …,SIAM Journal on Computing,1983,21

Dynamic miss-counting algorithms: Finding implication and similarity rules with confidence pruning,Shinji Fujiwara; Jeffrey D Ullman; Rajeev Motwani,Dynamic miss-counting (DMC) algorithms are proposed which find all implication andsimilarity rules with confidence pruning but without support pruning. To handle data sets witha large number of columns; we propose dynamic pruning techniques that can be appliedduring data scanning. DMC counts the numbers of rows in which each pair of columnsdisagree instead of counting the number of hits. DMC deletes a candidate as soon as thenumber of misses exceeds the maximum number of misses allowed for that pair. We alsopropose several optimization techniques that reduce the required memory size significantly.We evaluated our algorithms by using four data sets; viz. Web access logs; a Web page-linkgraph; news documents and a dictionary. These data sets have between 74;000 and700;000 items.

Operations on sparse relations and efficient algorithms for grammar problems,Harry B Hunt; Thomas G Szymanski; Jeffrey D Ullman,various operations on graphs; matrices; or relations can be executed more quickly when thearguments are" sparse"(ie; if e≪≪ v2where e is the number of edges and v the number ofvertices) than when they are" dense"(ie; e≈ v2). Fast algorithms are presented for a largeclass of operations on sparse relations. These algorithms are used to produce the bestknown methods for solving a variety of grammar problems relevant to parsing.

Such systems rely on wrappers that providerelational or other structured interfaces to websites.

A version numbering scheme with a useful lexicographical order,Arthur M Keller; Jeffrey D Ullman,We describe a numbering scheme for versions with alternatives that has a usefullexicographical ordering. The version hierarchy is a tree. By inspection of the versionnumbers; we can easily determine whether one version is an ancestor of another. If so; wecan determine the version sequence between these two versions. If not; we can determinethe most recent common ancestor to these two versions (ie; the least upper bound; lub).Sorting the version numbers lexicographically results in a version being followed by alldescendants and preceded by all its ancestors. We use a representation of nonnegativeintegers that is self delimiting and whose lexicographical ordering matches the ordering byvalue.,Data Engineering; 1995.

Correcting faults in write-once memory,Danny Dolev; David Maier; Ilarry Mairson; Jeffrey Ullman,We consider codes for write-once memory in tile presence of stuck-agO and stuebat--1faults. Such fault.-tolerant codes generally require less redundancy than error-correctingcodes; as faults detected during the writing process can affect subsequent behavior of thatprocess. We present pointer codes; which use part of a codeword to point to faults in otherparts of the codeword. A pointer code can encode n-bit messages in the presence of f faultswith only f (log 2 n+ o (1)) redundancy. We derive a lower bound on the redundancy of sucha fault-tolerant code of slightly less than f log n. We also examine some models where allstuck-at inforIlmtion is known in advance; and analyze the expected redundancy of pointercodes.,Proceedings of the sixteenth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,1984,16

We show that for fastsorting and minimal area; nets must connect at least√ n nodes each; if the network has nnodes.

In this briefarticle; I outline some of the ways the teaching of a college course in database systemscould be made more efficient; and staff time used more productively. These ideas carry overto other programming-oriented courses; and many of them apply to any academic subjectwhatsoever. After proposing a number of things that could be done; I concentrate here on asystem under development; called OTC (On-line Testing Center); and on its methodology of"root questions." These questions encourage students to do homework of the long-answertype; yet we can have their work checked and graded automatically by a simple multiple-choice-question grader. OTC also offers some improvement in the way we handle SQLhomework; and could be used with other languages as well.,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,15

Twodifferent definitions of “the same” error detection capability are considered. The first; called“exact equivalence”; permits only useless parts of the precedence matrix to be modified. Thesecond; called simply “equivalence”; allows the modified matrix to perform some reductions;but never to shift an input symbol; after the original has detected an error. We give necessaryand sufficient conditions for a modified precedence parser to be equivalent or exactlyequivalent to the canonical parser. We then consider the interesting case where themodification is caused by replacing the precedence matrix by linear precedence functions.

Datalog execution presents several unusualissues for this enviroment. We discuss the best way to execute a round of seminaiveevaluation on a computing cluster using the map-reduce. Using transitive closure as anexample; we examine the cost of executing recursions in several different ways. Recursiveprocesses such as evaluation of a recursive Datalog program do not fit the key map-reduceassumption that tasks deliver output only when they are completed.

Acomplete set of equivalence preserving transformations on programs is found for the case inwhich programs are equivalent if and only if their output functions are identical. This result isextended to the case in which programs are deemed equivalent if their output functions canbe shown equivalent under a fixed set of algebraic laws. It is also shown that in the noalgebra case and in cases where certain types of algebraic identities are allowed theproblem of finding optimal code under a reasonable cost function can be reduced to findinga desired sequence of topological and algebraic transformations on programs.,Proceedings of the second annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,1970,13

Matching bounds for the all-pairs MapReduce problem,Foto Afrati; Jeffrey Ullman,Abstract The all-pairs problem is an input-output relationship where each outputcorresponds to a pair of inputs; and each pair of inputs has a corresponding output. Itmodels similarity joins where no simplification of the search for similar pairs; eg; locality-sensitive hashing; is possible; and each input must be compared with every other input todetermine those pairs that are" similar." When implemented by a MapReduce algorithm;there was a gap; a factor of 2; between the lower bound on necessary communication andthe communication required by the best known algorithm. In this brief paper we show thatthe lower bound can essentially be met.,Proceedings of the 17th International Database Engineering & Applications Symposium,2013,12
Argument reduction by factoring,Jeffrey F Naughton; R Ramakrishnana; Yehoshua Sagiv; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract We identify a useful property of a program with respect to a predicate;calledfactoring. While we prove that detecting factorability is undecidable in general; weshow that for a large class of programs; the program obtained by applying the Magic Setstransformation is factorable with respect to the recursive predicate. When the factoringproperty holds; a simple optimization of the program generated by the Magic Setstransformation results in a new program that is never less efficient than the Magic Setsprogram and is often dramatically more efficient; due to the reduction of the arity of therecursive predicate. We show that the concept of factoring generalizes some previouslyidentified special cases of recursions; including separable recursions and right-and left-linear recursions.,Theoretical Computer Science,1995,12

We develop techniques for partially deciding which template and functionaldependencies are logically implied by a set of template and functional dependencies. Sincetemplate dependencies include all dependencies; besides functional dependencies; knownto us (such as multivalued; join; mutual; generalized mutual; and subset dependencies; andtheir embedded versions); the results of this paper enable us to apply the techniques fromSadri and Ullman [1979] to any set of data dependencies.,Proceedings of the 1980 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,1980,12
Finding the depth of a flow graph,Amelia C Fong; Jeffrey D Ullman,The depth of a flow graph is the maximum number of back edges in an acyclic path; where aback edge is defined by some depth-first spanning tree for the flow graph. In the case of areducible graph; the depth is independent of the depth-first spanning tree chosen. We showthat the computation of the depth of a reducible flow graph requires polynomial time. Ouralgorithm is O (ne) on a flow graph of n nodes and e edges. Since e≤ 2n for normal flowgraphs; our algorithm is really O (n 2). While even an O (n 2) algorithm is not likely to beacceptable; it is suggestive of the possibility of a more efficient algorithm. Finally; we showthat the general problem of computing the depth of an arbitrary flow graph is NP-complete.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,1977,12
Decidable and undecidable questions about automata,John E Hopcroft; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract Four types of balloon automata (defined by one-or two-way input and deterministicor nondeterministic finite control) and closed classes of balloon automata were previouslydefined by the authors. A set of closed classes; one for each of the four types; is called afamily if the classes use their infinite storage in the same way. The recursiveness andsolvability of the emptiness problem for closed classes are investigated in the present paper.It is shown that in many cases the solvability of one of these questions for one closed classin a family implies that some other question are solvable for the closed classes of that family.,Journal of the ACM (JACM),1968,12

Querying semistructured heterogeneous information,Dallan Quass; Anand Rajaraman; Jeffrey Ullman; Jennifer Widom; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract Semistructured data has no absolute schema fixed in advance and its structure maybe irregular or incomplete. Such data commonly arises in sources that do not impose a rigidstructure (such as the World-Wide Web) and when data is combined from severalheterogeneous sources. Data models and query languages designed for well structureddata are inappropriate in such environments. Starting with a “lightweight” object modeladopted for the TSIMMIS project at Stanford; in this paper we describe a query languageand object repository designed specifically for semistructured data. Our language providesmeaningful query results in cases where conventional models and languages do not: whensome data is absent; when data does not have regular structure; when similar concepts arerepresented using different types; when heterogeneous sets are present; and when …,Journal of Systems Integration,1997,11

Designing good algorithms for MapReduce and beyond,Foto N Afrati; Magdalena Balazinska; Anish Das Sarma; Bill Howe; Semih Salihoglu; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract As MapReduce/Hadoop grows in importance; we find more exotic applicationsbeing written this way. Not every program written for this platform performs as well as wemight wish. There are several reasons why a MapReduce program can underperformexpectations. One is the need to balance the communication cost of transporting data fromthe mappers to the reducers against the computation done at the mappers and reducersthemselves. A second important issue is selecting the number of rounds of MapReduce. Athird issue is that of skew. If wall-clock time is important; then using many different reduce-keys and many compute nodes may minimize the time to finish the job. Yet if the data isuncooperative; and no provision is made to distribute the data evenly; much of the work isdone by a single node.,Proceedings of the Third ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing,2012,10

The interface between language theory and database theory,Jeffrey D Ullman,ABSTRACT Two of the great themes in the work of Seymour Ginsburg are language theoryand database theory. When I worked for SG at System Development Corp. in 1965; he wasin the process of formulating the material of language theory: closure properties; decidabilityproperties; and structure of subclasses. These were summarized in the book Ginsburg[1966]; which I had the opportunity to read in note form. Much later; SG and I both becameinterested in database theory; and it is interesting to see how ideas from language theorycarry over to an important area of database theory: logical rules and queries. In this paper;we shall summarize the relationship between languages and logical rules. There is a naturalreduction from context-free grammars to a special case of logical rules called “chain rules.”We are able to answer difficult questions about logical queries through language …,*,1992,10
On the convergence of query evaluation,Foto Afrati; Christos H Papadimitriou; George Papageorgiou; Athena Roussou; Yehoshua Sagiv; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract We propose a “sideways information passing” method for evaluating Horn clausequeries in the presence of monotonicity constraints on the database relations. We give anecessary and sufficient condition for its convergence and show that testing for the conditionis polynomial when the arity of the relations is bounded; and PSPACE-complete otherwise.We also prove a related condition for the case of downward finite domains (eg; Herbranduniverses); thus improving an algorithm by Naish for a class of Prolog programs.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,1989,10

The revenge of the JD,David Maier; Jeffrey D Ullman; Moshe Y Vardi,Abstract Manifestations of the" universal relation assumption" can be seen either asdefinitions of a one-relation user view of data; or as algorithms for answering queries aboutarbitrary sets of attributes. In this paper we explore equivalences between these two pointsof view. We show that if the user's view is the representative instance; then our ability toanswer queries about the universal relation; by applying relational algebra to the actualdatabase; is equivalent to a" boundedness" condition on the dependencies of the databasescheme. Further; whenever this condition holds; there is a finite union of lossless tableaumappings that produces the desired relation.,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD symposium on Principles of database systems,1983,10

Assignment problems of different-sized inputs in MapReduce,Foto Afrati; Shlomi Dolev; Ephraim Korach; Shantanu Sharma; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract A MapReduce algorithm can be described by a mapping schema; which assignsinputs to a set of reducers; such that for each required output there exists a reducer thatreceives all the inputs participating in the computation of this output. Reducers have acapacity that limits the sets of inputs they can be assigned. However; individual inputs mayvary in terms of size. We consider; for the first time; mapping schemas where input sizes arepart of the considerations and restrictions. One of the significant parameters to optimize inany MapReduce job is communication cost between the map and reduce phases. Thecommunication cost can be optimized by minimizing the number of copies of inputs sent tothe reducers. The communication cost is closely related to the number of reducers ofconstrained capacity that are used to accommodate appropriately the inputs; so that the …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2016,9
Bounds for Overlapping Interval Join on MapReduce.,Foto N Afrati; Shlomi Dolev; Shantanu Sharma; Jeffrey D Ullman,ABSTRACT We consider the problem of 2-way interval join; where we want to find all pairsof overlapping intervals; ie; intervals that share at least one point in common. We presentlower and upper bounds on the replication rate for this problem when it is implemented inMapReduce. We study three cases; where intervals in the input are:(i) unit-length andequally-spaced;(ii) variable-length and equally-spaced; and (iii) equally-spaced with specificdistribution of the various lengths. Our algorithms offer intuition as how to build algorithms forother cases; especially when we have some statistical knowledge about the distribution ofthe lengths of the intervals. Eg; if mostly large intervals interact with small intervals and notwithin themselves; then we believe our techniques can be extended to achieve betterreplication rate.,EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2015,9

A survey of association-rule mining,Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract The standard model for association-rule mining involves a set of “items” and a set of“baskets.” The baskets contain items that some customer has purchased at the same time.The problem is to find pairs; or perhaps larger sets; of items that frequently appear togetherin baskets. We mention the principal approaches to efficient; large-scale discovery of thefrequent itemsets; including the a-priori algorithm; improvements using hashing; and one-and two-pass probabilistic algorithms for finding frequent itemsets.

Efficient and complete tests for database integrity constraint checking,Ashish Gupta; Yehoshua Sagiv; Jeffrey D Ullman; Jennifer Widom,An important feature of modem database management systems is the automatic checking ofintegrity constraints. An integrity constraint is a predicate or query such that if the predicateholds on a state of the data; or equivalently if the query produces an empty answer; then thedatabase is considered valid. When an integrity constraint is violated; ie; when the predicatedoes not hold or the query produces a non-empty answer; then the update creating theundesirable database state must be rejected or some other compensating action must betaken. We are interested in efficient methods for checking integrity constraints (hereaftercalled constraints) as a database is updated. Here; general efficiency is measured both inthe amount of data that needs to be accessed in order to check a constraint; and in whetherthe check can be performed by submitting a query to the database system (rather than …,*,1994,9

Equivalence of programs with structured variables,Alfred V.  Aho; Jeffrey D.  Ullman,We consider a class of straight line programs admitting structured variables. It is easy toassociate with each program a set of expressions which reflects the natural meaning of astructured variable such as an array. However; the question of whether two suchexpressions are equivalent depends on what is assumed about the possible initial values ofthe variables and what algebraic laws are assumed to apply. We give necessary andsufficient conditions for two such assumptions to yield the same equivalences amongexpressions. The assumption which gives the smallest set of equivalences is exhibited. Thisassumption plays the role of “strong equivalence;” since it implies equivalence under anypossible interpretation of the model which preserves the interpretation of “structure”; as wedefine it.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,1972,9

Anchor points algorithms for hamming and edit distance,Foto Afrati; Anish Das Sarma; Anand Rajaraman; Pokey Rule; Semih Salihoglu; Jeffrey Ullman,Algorithms for computing similarity joins in MapReduce were offered in [2]. Similarity joinsask to find input pairs that are within a certain distance d according to some distancemeasure. Here we explore the``anchor-points algorithm''of [2]. We continue looking atHamming distance; and show that the method of that paper can be improved; in particular; ifwe want to find strings within Hamming distance d; and anchor points are chosen so thatevery possible input is within Hamming distance k of some anchor point; then it is sufficientto send each input to all anchor points within distance (d/2)+ k; rather than d+ k as wassuggested in the earlier paper. This improves on the communication cost of the MapReducealgorithm; ie; reduces the amount of data transmitted among machines. Further; the sameholds for edit distance; provided inputs all have the same length n and either the length of …,*,2014,8

Maximum H-colourable subdigraphs and constraint optimization with arbitrary weights,Peter Jonsson; Andrei Krokhin,Abstract In the maximum constraint satisfaction problem (Max CSP); one is given a finitecollection of positive-weight constraints on overlapping sets of variables; and the goal is toassign values from a given domain to the variables so that the total weight of satisfiedconstraints is maximized. We consider this problem and its variant Max AW CSP where theweights are allowed to be both positive and negative; and study how the complexity of theproblems depends on the allowed constraint types. We prove that Max AW CSP over anarbitrary finite domain exhibits a dichotomy: it is either polynomial-time solvable or NP-hard.Our proof builds on two results that may be of independent interest: one is that the problemof finding a maximum H-colourable subdigraph in a given digraph is either NP-hard or trivialdepending on H; and the other a dichotomy result for Max CSP with a single allowed …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2007,8

On the computational power of pushdown automata,Alfred V.  Aho; Jeffrey D.  Ullman; John E.

Specifically; let Lbe a language accepted by a nondeterministic off-line Turing machine T. Let T have a t-symbol storage-tape alphabet. If for all but a finite number of n; T uses no more than log 2t nstorage cells when given an input of length n; then L is accepted by a twowaynondeterministic pushdown automaton. Thus; any nondeterministic tape complexity class L(n) such that sup n→∞(L (n)/logn))= 0 is a subfamily of the two-way nondeterministicpushdown automaton languages.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,1970,8

We optimize on communication cost; ie; theamount of data that is transferred from the mappers to the reducers. We identify joinattributes values that appear very frequently; Heavy Hitters (HH). We distribute HH valuedrecords to reducers avoiding skew by using an adaptation of the Shares~\cite {AfUl}algorithm to achieve minimum communication cost. Our algorithm is implemented forexperimentation and is offered as open source software. Furthermore; we investigate a classof multiway joins for which a simpler variant of the algorithm can handle skew.

Storing and querying tree-structured records in dremel,Foto N Afrati; Dan Delorey; Mosha Pasumansky; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract In Dremel; data is stored as nested relations. The schema for a relation is a tree; allof whose nodes are attributes; and whose leaf attributes hold values. We explore filter andaggregate queries that are given in the Dremel dialect of SQL. Complications arise becauseof repeated attributes; ie; attributes that are allowed to have more than one value. We focuson the common class of Dremel queries that are processed on column-stored data in a waythat results in query processing time that is linear on the size of the relevant data; ie; data inthe columns that participate in the query. We formally define the data model; the querylanguage and the algorithms for query processing in column-stored data. The concepts ofrepetition context and semi-flattening are introduced here and play a central role inunderstanding this class of queries and their algorithms.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,5
A new computation model for cluster computing,Foto N Afrati; Jeffrey D Ullman,Implementations of map-reduce are being used to perform many operations on very largedata. We explore alternative ways that a system could use the environment and capabilitiesof map-reduce implementations such as Hadoop; yet perform operations that are notidentical to map-reduce. The centerpiece of this exploration is a computational model thatcaptures the essentials of the environment in which systems like Hadoop operate. Files areunordered sets of tuples that can be read and/or written in parallel; processes are limited inthe amount of input/output they can perform; and processors are available in essentiallyunlimited supply. We develop; in this model; an algorithm for sorting that has a worst-caserunning time better than the obvious implementations of parallel sorting.,*,2009,5

The theory of functional and template dependencies,Fereidoon Sadri; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract Template dependencies were introduced by Sadri and Ullman [17] to generalizeexisting forms of data dependencies. It was hoped that by studying a large and natural classof dependencies; we could solve the inference problem for these dependencies; while thatproblem was elusive for restricted subsets of the template dependencies; such asembedded multivalued dependencies. At about the same time; other generalizations ofknown dependency forms were developed; such as the implicational dependencies of Fagin[11] and the algebraic dependencies of Yannakakis and Papadimitriou [20]. Unlike thetemplate dependencies; the latter forms include the functional dependencies as specialcases. In this paper we show that no nontrivial functional dependency follows from templatedependencies; and we characterize those template dependencies that follow from …,Theoretical Computer Science,1982,5
Evaluating relational expressions with dense and sparse arguments,Thomas G.  Szymanski; Jeffrey D.  Ullman,We consider expressions whose arguments are relations and whose operators are chosenfrom among ∪;∘;^*; and ^-1. We further assume that operands may be designated “sparse”or “dense”; in a manner to be made formal subsequently. Our aim is to determine whetherthe evaluation of such an expression is (a) as hard as general transitive closure;(b) as hardas transitive closure for sparse graphs;(c) as hard as finding connected components of anundirected graph.,SIAM Journal on Computing,1977,5

Linear precedence functions for weak precedence grammars,AV Aho; JD Ullman,Linear precedence functions can be used to compress the information of certain precedencematrices. While saving space; the method applied to Wirth-Weber precedence matricescauses the detection of errors to be occasionally delayed. When shift-reduce decisions arebased on a weak precedence grammar; however; it is often possible to find linear pre-cedence functions which preserve some of the error checking capability of the matrix. Whilethe maximization of the amount of error checking is a large combinatorial problem;algorithms to reduce the search time can be given.,International Journal of Computer Mathematics,1972,4
Characterizations and extensions of pushdown translations,Alfred V.  Aho; Jeffrey D.  Ullman,Abstract A device called a pushdown assembler has been recently introduced and has beenshown capable of defining exactly the syntax directed translations (SDT's). The outputoperation of the pushdown assembler can be extended in a natural way to obtain a morepowerful device called a type B pushdown assembler (or B-machine). A B-machine candefine SDT's more simply and directly than the original pushdown assembler. B-machinescan also define many interesting translations which are not SDT's. In this paper the B-machine is defined and compared with the original pushdown assembler. The properties ofB-machine translations are investigated and it is shown that; as with SDT's; there exists anatural infinite hierarchy of B-machine translations.,Mathematical systems theory,1971,4

Computing marginals using MapReduce,Foto N Afrati; Shantanu Sharma; Jonathan R Ullman; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract We consider the problem of computing data-cube marginals by a single round ofMapReduce; focusing on the relationship between the reducer size and the replication rate.Initially; we simplify the problem by making the extent of each dimension the same. Severalrecursive constructions meet or come close to the minimum possible replication rate for agiven reducer size. These ideas extend in two directions. We relax the assumption that theextents are all equal; and we consider how to compute marginals from lower-ordermarginals rather than from the raw data cube.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2017,3
Efficient and private approximations of distributed databases calculations,Philip Derbeko; Shlomi Dolev; Ehud Gudes; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract: In recent years; an increasing amount of data is collected in different and often; notcooperative; databases. The problem of privacy-preserving; distributed calculations overseparated databases and; a relative to it; issue of private data release were intensivelyinvestigated. However; despite a considerable progress; computational complexity; due toan increasing size of data; remains a limiting factor in real-world deployments; especially incase of privacy-preserving computations. In this paper; we present a general method fortrade off between performance and accuracy of distributed calculations by performing datasampling. Sampling was a topic of extensive research that recently received a boost ofinterest. We provide a sampling method targeted at separate; non-collaborating; verticallypartitioned datasets.

Meta-MapReduce: A technique for reducing communication in MapReduce computations,Foto Afrati; Shlomi Dolev; Shantanu Sharma; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract: MapReduce has proven to be one of the most useful paradigms in the revolution ofdistributed computing; where cloud services and cluster computing become the standardvenue for computing. The federation of cloud and big data activities is the next challengewhere MapReduce should be modified to avoid (big) data migration across remote (cloud)sites. This is exactly our scope of research; where only the very essential data for obtainingthe result is transmitted; reducing communication; processing and preserving data privacyas much as possible. In this work; we propose an algorithmic technique for MapReducealgorithms; called Meta-MapReduce; that decreases the communication cost by allowing usto process and move metadata to clouds and from the map phase to reduce phase. In Meta-MapReduce; the reduce phase fetches only the required data at required iterations; which …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1508.01171,2015,3
MapReduce Algorithms,Jeff Ullman,Abstract We begin with a sketch of how MapReduce works and how MapReduce algorithmsdiffer from general parallel algorithms. While algorithm analysis usually centers on the serialor parallel running time of the algorithms that solve a given problem; in the MapReduceworld; the critical issue is a tradeoff between interprocessor communication and the parallelrunning time. We examine a fundamental problem; in which the output depends oncomparison of all pairs of inputs (the" all-pairs" problem); and show matching upper andlower bounds for the communication/time tradeoff. Finally; we consider special cases of all-pairs; where only a subset of the pairs of inputs are of interest; an example is the problem ofsimilarity join.,Proceedings of the 2nd IKDD Conference on Data Sciences,2015,3

Automated training and evaluation,*,In order to provide improved training and testing; a solution to a given problem is acceptedfrom a user. The solution is tested to ensure that it is syntactically and semantically correct. Ifit is not; then information is displayed to the user regarding the problems. Evaluation casesare used to test semantic correctness. When an evaluation case indicates that a semanticproblem has been encountered; the evaluation case is not presented to the user. Rather asimilar training case is presented which is calculated to demonstrate the same semanticproblem as the evaluation case. Thus; the user can be helped to understand the issuewithout being provided with the evaluation cases on which the solution is being tested.,*,2005,3

Logic and database systems,Jeffrey D Ullman,I could cite the progression from assembly language to Fortran or Fortran to APL asexamples; but let's concentrate on the history of databases; which I see as: (1) The early systems(network etc.) gave the user the ability to program navigation through data; (2) Good ways toimplement queries were understood and used in the implementation of relational systems;(3) Relational systems replaced earlier systems in many applications. I see another exampleof the cycle beginning in the area of logic and databases. The need for logic-oriented languagesthat provide more power than relational query languages has been perceived; and exam- ples(eg; Prolog); that provide the capability to the programmer wil- ling to master the navigationalaspects; have been built.

Pushdown automata with bounded backtrack,Jeffrey Ullman,Abstract: The report considers two classes of pushdown automata (pda); and the languagesaccepted by them. These pda accept their languages rapidly because they reread the inputword a limited number of times; hence; such languages are particularly useful asprogramming languages. The first class; strong bounded backtrack pda; read input wordsfrom left to right; and jump from right to left (backtrack). The languages accepted by suchautomata will be shown to be equivalent to the finite unions of deterministic languages. Thesecond class; weak bounded backtrack an arbitrary number of times. The device reads aword from left to right; simulating the action of the pda. Every time the pda reaches a totalconfiguration (state and pushdown tape) in which it is possible to read another input letter;that configuration is stored.

Adverse Event Profiles for Multi-drug Combinations,Srinivasan Iyer; Kushal Tayal; Siddhi Soman; Jeff Ullman,The practice of polypharmacy has become widespread today and it is well known that thisleads to an increased risk of adverse events. It is infeasible for drug manufacturers to testexhaustively for adverse events caused by interaction of drugs with other co-prescribedmedications owing to the sheer number of combinations. Owing to this; most interactions arerealized after the drug has been in use for some time and it is vital that such reactions beidentified and acted upon quickly. At present; drug interaction effects are primarily availablein the form of voluntary reports through Spontaneous Reporting Systems (SRS) such asFDA's AERS and these report are subject to various biases [1].

Some pairs problems,Jeffrey D Ullman; Jonathan Ullman,Abstract A common form of MapReduce application involves discovering relationshipsbetween certain pairs of inputs. Similarity joins serve as a good example of this type ofproblem; which we call a" some-pairs" problem. In the framework of [4]; algorithms aremeasured by the tradeoff between reducer size (maximum number of inputs a reducer canhandle) and the replication rate (average number of reducers to which an input must besent. There are two obvious approaches to solving some-pairs problems in general. Weshow that no general-purpose MapReduce algorithm can beat both of these two algorithmsin the worst case. We then explore a recursive algorithm for solving some-pairs problemsand heuristics for beating the lower bound on common instances of the some-pairs class ofproblems.,Proceedings of the 3rd ACM SIGMOD Workshop on Algorithms and Systems for MapReduce and Beyond,2016,1

However; ensuring an identical location of data and mappers-reducers cannot always be guaranteed. On the other hand; it may be possible that a user …,Stabilization; Safety; and Security of Distributed Systems: 17th International Symposium; SSS 2015; Edmonton; AB; Canada; August 18-21; 2015; Proceedings,2015,1
Handling skew in multiway joins in parallel processing,Foto N Afrati; Jeffrey D Ullman; Angelos Vasilakopoulos,Abstract: Handling skew is one of the major challenges in query processing. In distributedcomputational environments such as MapReduce; uneven distribution of the data to theservers is not desired. One of the dominant measures that we want to optimize in distributedenvironments is communication cost. In a MapReduce job this is the amount of data that istransferred from the mappers to the reducers. In this paper we will introduce a noveltechnique for handling skew when we want to compute a multiway join in one MapReduceround with minimum communication cost. This technique is actually an adaptation of theShares algorithm [Afrati et. al; TKDE 2011].,arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.03247,2015,1
Brief Announcement: Assignment of Different-Sized Inputs in MapReduce⋆,Foto Afrati; Shlomi Dolev; Ephraim Korach; Shantanu Sharma; Jeffrey D Ullman,Reducer Capacity. An important parameter to be considered in MapReduce algorithms isthe “reducer capacity.” A reducer is an application of the reduce function to a single key andits associated list of values. The reducer capacity is an upper bound on the sum of the sizesof the values that are assigned to the reducer. For example; we may choose the reducercapacity to be the size of the main memory of the processors on which the reducers run. Weassume that all the reducers have an identical capacity; denoted by q. Motivation andExamples. We demonstrate a new aspect of the reducer capacity in the scope of severalspecial cases. One useful special case is where an output depends on exactly two inputs.We present two examples where each output depends on exactly two inputs and define twoproblems that are based on these examples.,Distributed,2014,1

A survey of new directions in database systems,Jeffrey D Ullman,Summary form only given; as follows. As database system research evolves; there areseveral enduring themes. One; of course; is how we deal with the largest possible amountsof data. A less obvious theme is optimization¿ it is an essential ingredient of all modernforms of database system. Because we deal with large volumes of data; we are often forcedto process that data in regular ways. But when operations are uniform; there is anopportunity for the use of very-high-level languages; of which SQL is the primary example.However; to make a very-high-level language effective; we need to optimize it well; that is;produce effective query plans from all sorts of queries. In this talk; we shall review theprincipal directions in which modern database research is going; and in each case talk a bitabout the optimization problems.

An approach to processing queries in a logic-based query language,Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract We summarize the “capture rule” approach to planning queries in a rule-orienteddatabase management system. Selecting from among strategies for the application of logicalrules to data may be viewed as an advanced form of query optimization. Capture rulesprovide a framework within which a system can make such decisions. They also assist in thedevelopment of a theory of optimal strategies for logic processing. This paper surveys someof the known capture rules and suggests how they can be fit together into a system thatprovides “knowledge processing” with database management.,*,1986,1

Data Science Education: We're Missing the Boat; Again,Bill Howe; Michael Franklin; Laura Haas; Tim Kraska; Jeffrey Ullman,In the first wave of data science education programs; data engineering topics (systems;scalable algorithms; data management; integration) tended to be de-emphasized in favor ofmachine learning and statistical modeling. The anecdotal evidence suggests this was amistake: data scientists report spending most of their time grappling with data far upstream ofmodeling activities. A second wave of data science education is emerging; one withincreased emphasis on practical issues in ethics; legal compliance; scientific reproducibility;data quality; and algorithmic bias. The data engineering community has a second chance toinfluence these programs beyond just providing a set of tools.

Computing Marginals Using MapReduce: Keynote talk paper,Foto N Afrati; Shantanu Sharma; Jeffrey D Ullman; Jonathan R Ullman,Abstract We consider the problem of computing the data-cube marginals of a fixed order k(ie; all marginals that aggregate over k dimensions); using a single round of MapReduce.The focus is on the relationship between the reducer size (number of inputs allowed at asingle reducer) and the replication rate (number of reducers to which an input is sent). Weshow that the replication rate is minimized when the reducers receive all the inputsnecessary to compute one marginal of higher order. That observation lets us view theproblem as one of covering sets of k dimensions with sets of a larger size m; a problem thathas been studied under the name" covering numbers." We offer a number of constructionsthat; for different values of k and m meet or come close to yielding the minimum possiblereplication rate for a given reducer size.,Proceedings of the 20th International Database Engineering & Applications Symposium,2016,*
Portrait of an Indexer—Computing Pointers Into Instructional Videos,Andrew Lamb; Jose Hernandez; Jeffrey Ullman; Andreas Paepcke,We examine algorithms for creating indexes into ordered series of instructional lecture videotranscripts. The goal is for students and industry practitioners to use the indexes towardsreview or reference. Lecture videos differ from often-examined document collections such asnewspaper articles in that the transcript ordering generally reflects pedagogical intent. Onechallenge is therefore to identify where a concept is primarily introduced; and where theresulting index should thus direct students. The typically applied TF-IDF approach getstricked in this context by artifacts such as worked examples whose associated vocabularymay dominate a lecture; but should not be included in a good index. We contrast the TF-IDFapproach with algorithms that consult Wikipedia documents to vouch for term importance.This method helps filter the harmful artifacts.

The reducer capacity is an upper bound on thesum of the sizes of the inputs that are assigned to the reducer. We consider; for the first time;the different sizes of the inputs; which are sent to the reducers. Another significant parameterin a MapReduce job is" communication cost"--the total amount of data transferred--betweenthe map and reduce phases. The communication cost can be minimized by minimizing thenumber of copies of inputs sent to the reducers.,Proceedings of the 8th ACM International Systems and Storage Conference,2015,*

Department of Computer Science Stanford University,Jeffrey D Ullman,ABSTRACT Two of the great themes in the work of Seymour Ginsburg are language theoryand database theory. When I worked for SG at System Development Corp. in 1965; he wasin the process of formulating the material of language theory: closure properties; decidabilityproperties; and struc-ture of subclasses. These were summarized in the book Ginsburg[1966]. which I had the opportunity to read in note form. Much later; SG and I both becameinterested in database theory; and it is interesting to see how ideas from language theorycarry over to an important area of database theory: logical rules and queries. In this paper;we shall summarize the relationship between languages and logical rules. There is a naturalreduction from context-free grammars to a special case of logical rules called “chain rules.”We are able to answer difficult questions about logical queries through language …,Theoretical Studies in Computer Science,2014,*

As can be seen from the previous chapter;deterministic finite automata (DFA) cannot accept even very simple languages such as\left{x^ ny^ n\left| n ∈ N\right.\right\}; but fortunately; there exists a more powerful machine; push-down automata; which can accept it. Just as DFA and nondeterministic finite automata(NFA); there are also two types of push-down automata: deterministic push-down automata(DPDA) and non-deterministic push-down automata (NPDA). The languages which can beaccepted by PDA are called context-free languages (CFL); denoted by LCF.Diagrammatically; a PDA is a finite state automaton (see Fig. 5.1); with memories (push-down stacks).

Foundations of Databases</title,Serge Abiteboul; Victor Vianu; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract. In this paper; we first rephrase the notion of extended tuple as a sentence from aregular language generated by a grammar G where the nonterminal symbols of thegrammar are the attribute names of the tuple. Finite sets of extended tuples play the role ofextended relation instances. Then we introduce the dual language; which generates theaccepted tuple-types of the extended relation. We define the syntactical form of functionaldependencies for extended relation on the graph of the finite state automaton associated tothe dual language. Using this model we can handle extended relations generated byrecursive regular expressions too. The implication problem of our class of dependencies isdecidable by a version of Chase algorithm specified on the graph of the associated FSA.,Foundations of Information and Knowledge Systems,2002,*

Generating Efficient Plans for Queries Using Views (Full Version),Foto Afrati; Chen Li; Jeff Ullman,We study the problem of generating efficient; equivalent rewritings using views to computethe answer to a query. We take the closed-world assumption; in which views arematerialized from base relations; rather than views describing sources in terms of abstractpredicates; as is common when the open-world assumption is used. In the closed-worldmodel; there can be an infinite number of different rewritings that compute the same answer;yet have quite different performance. Query optimizers take a logical plan (a rewriting of thequery) as an input; and generate efficient physical plans to compute the answer. Thus ourgoal is to generate a small subset of the possible logical plans without missing an optimalphysical plan. We first consider a cost model that counts the number of subgoals in aphysical plan; and show a search space that is guaranteed to include an optimal rewriting …,*,2001,*

Some Advances in Data-Mining Techniques,Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract Research in the MIDAS project at Stanford explores new ideas in data-mining. Oneearly result was a new algorithm for Web search; that resulted in a recently turnedcommercial search engine; called Google. A second area of interest is in generalizing thetechniques such as “a-priori;” which were developed by Rakesh Agrawal and his associatesat IBM Research in Almaden to allow “market-basket analysis;” or “association-rule mining.”The latter problem deals with finding items that customers frequently buy together. We havedeveloped a framework called “query flocks.” In this system; we can phrase highly complexdata-mining queries; including many that are not handled well by commercial SQL systems.We then compile the “query flock” into a sequence of SQL queries that are simple enough tobe optimized by commercial systems.

Query Flocks: A Generalization of Association-Rule Mining,Jeffrey D Ullman; Rajeev Motwani; Svetlozar Nestorov,Abstract Association-rule mining has proved a highly successful tech-nique for extractinguseful information from very large databases. This success is attributed not only to theappropriateness of the objectives; but to the fact that a number of new query-optimizationideas; such as the “a-priori” trick; make association-rule mining run much faster than mightbe expected. In this paper we see that the same tricks can be extended to a much moregeneral context; allowing efficient mining of very large databases for many different kinds ofpatterns.

Efficient Management of Active Databases,Jeffrey D Ullman; Jennifer Widom,Abstract: We have made advances in the following areas: Data cubes: these recent data-warehouse products need a way to optimize the use of space by selecting some views tomaintain permanently. We have identified the'monotonicy'property choosing one viewcannot increase the value of materializing another view as guaranteeing the existence of apolynomial-time competitive (guaranteed to come within a constant fraction of optimum)solution. In one important nonmonotone case; data cubes with indexes on views; weshowed how to find a polynomial competitive algorithm. Self Maintenance of views: We havetechniques for deciding whether or not a view that is defined by a conjunctive query can bemaintained in the face of an update to a base relation; without issuing queries to one ormore base relations.

Moving database theory into database practice,Jeff Ullman,While I waver periodically about the importance of logic; datalog; etc; in database research;right now I'm very optimistic. The technology is beginning to see the light of day incommercial ventures; there is a new SQL3 standard for recursion based onthe``datalog''approach; and there are some new and very exciting applications in theintegration/warehousing area that exploit the core datalog technology in surprising and veryuseful ways.

Research Into Multimedia Database Systems,Jeffrey Ullman,Abstract There is no doubt that the use of multimedia information is growing rapidly. The firstquestion to ask is to what extent database research and/or expertise should be expected toprovide solutions to the problems related to multimedia information. We identify severalareas where we can be optimistic that database technology will be important: Managementof tertiary storage; Development of type systems for special kinds of information; Querysystems for multimedia information (including user interfaces); and support for varyingqualities of service. In each of these areas we shall consider the prospects for researchachievements and breakthroughs.,11. SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES,1995,*

Research into the Design and Implementation of Knowledge Base Systems,Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract: The general goal of the work has been to develop the techniques needed toprocess queries; expressed as logic programs; efficiently. A system called NAIL wasdeveloped; bu mid-1989; to test out our ideas. It was fully declarative; which we found aninteresting challenge; and its implementation exposed a number of issues that lead toimportant new ideas and research. However; the full declarativeness proved too much of aburden in writing some applications that we hoped would be facilitated by a logic/databaselanguage; and NAIL was abandoned in favor of a new language; called GLUE; that islogical; but that allows for controlled-flow; sets as data values; aggregation operators suchas sums of average. NAIL now serves as the view facility for GLUE; and we are in theprocess of writing a NAIL-to-GLUE translator that will offer both nondeclarative …,*,1990,*

17 _ 27 Caching,AV Aho; JE Hopcroft; JD Ullman,Abstract When searching a goal tree; an unbounded amount of work can be wasted solvingthe same problem over and over. Even worse; an unbounded amount of work can be wastedin an infinite recursion. The Standard technique of caching previous results can solve bothproblems. The cache is indexed by goal; normally implemented as a hash table. Each goalis associated with its current Solution status—either it is solved (in which case the answer isstored); it has failed; or it is still open. Whenever a goal is to be proved; the cache issearched first. If it is not there; a cache entry marked open should be created. If the cachedgoal has succeeded or failed just use the stored answer. In the special case of depth-firstsearch< 61>; infinite recursion occurs when an open cached goal is re-encountered; in thisSituation; the goal should be treated as though it has failed; though it should not be …,*,1990,*

Algorithms for the compilation of regular expressions into PLAs,Anna R Karlin; Howard W Trickey; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract The language of regular expressions is a useful one for specifying certainsequential processes at a very high level. They allow easy modification of designs forcircuits; like controllers; that are described by patterns of events they must recognize and theresponses they must make to those patterns. This paper discusses the compilation of suchexpressions into specifications for programmable logic arrays (PLAs) that will implement therequired function. A regular expression is converted into a nondeterministic finite automaton;and then the automaton states are encoded as values on wires that are inputs and outputs ofa PLA. The translation of regular expressions into nondeterministic automata by two differentmethods is discussed; along with the advantages of each method. A major part of thecompilation problem is selection of good state codes for the nondeterministic automata; …,Algorithmica,1987,*

Universal Relation Database Systems.,Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract: The query facility for their universal relation database system is now working. Thefundamental paper unifying ideas on what a UR system can and should be has beenpublished. A paper surveying developments in the field of universal relation systems wasinvited for the triennial IFIP Congress and was delivered in September. Some initial resultson logical theories applied to the problem of updating views have been obtained. Therehave been a number of developments concerning inference of inclusion dependencies andon the complexity of deciding certain properties of data base schemes. Some interestingresults on the difficulty of obtaining hash functions that work well for particular sets of datahave been obtained and won an award.(Author) Descriptors:* Data management;* Databases; Computer logic; Semantics; Parsers; Systems engineering; Information retrieval …,*,1983,*

The Equivalence of Universal Relation Definitions.,Jeffrey D Ullman; Moshe Y Vardi; David Maier,Abstract: The universal relation model aims at achieving complete access pathindependence by relieving the user of the need for logical navigation among relations. Itassumes that for every set of attributes there is a basic relationship that the user has in mind.Two fundamentally different approaches to the universal relation model have been taken.The first approach sees the universal relation as a user view; about which he poses queries.Specifically; a representative instance is constructed; and queries are answered based onits non-null part. The second approach sees the model as having query-processingcapabilities that relieve the user of the need to specify the logical access path. Therelationship between the user's view and the computation answering a query is a centralissue that systems supporting a universal view of data must handle. We introduce …,*,1982,*
Design of a Universal Relation Database System.,Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract: While the relational model removes some of the task of navigation in the databasefrom the user; it still leaves navigational responsibility with the user when multirelationalqueries are involved. To remove this responsibility from the user; the authors have begunimplementing a universal relation user interface; that allows the user to see the data as onelarge relation; ie; table; over all the attributes. Since there may be more than one connectionamong the attributes mentioned in a query; they have developed a fairly complex theory toallow the database designer to force certain connections to be taken by the database systemand to aid him by suggesting connections that the authors believe to be natural. This theoryincludes the hypergraph representation of databases; explored last year; and the notion ofacyclic hypergraphs; which are those with unique connections among attributes.(Author) …,*,1982,*

R69-19 On the Elimination of Endmarkers,JD Ullman,This paper is written by automata theorists for automata theorists. In numerous definitions ofautomata; there is an" input head" which is expected to be positioned at one square of an"input tape" at all times. There is often the possibility that the automaton might cause the inputhead to move right; say; from the rightmost input square; before theautomaton has had achance to do all the computation it wanted to do. Thus;" endmarkers"—special symbols thatappear on the leftmost and rightmost input squares but are not otherwise considered part ofthe input-are often part of the automaton definition. This paper demonstrates that in severalcases the endmarkers are unnecessary in that a class of automata with end markersrecognizes only languages that are recognizable by the analogous classes of automatawithout one or both of the endmarkers.,IEEE Transactions on Computers,1969,*

The author indicates in the preface that he hasintended to cover the topic of the interrelation of numerical mathematics and computerscience. The topics treated are well balanced between rigorous mathematical proofs; andthe limitations placed on solving these mathematical problems due to the characteristics of acomputer. The material in this book is considerably more mathematically oriented than wasVolume I; which has been previously reviewed by WJ Worlton [Nucl. Sci. Eng.; 34; 198(1968)]. This series of books is perhaps the most ambitious undertaking in this field to date.The first of the two chapters deals with random numbers which; as the author points out; is asubject often not fully understood by many of the people using random numbers.

A recognition algorithm for pushdown store systems,Alfred V Aho; John E Hopcroft; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract A pushdown store is a list in which information can be accessed only on a last-infirst-out principle of operation. The use of pushdown stores is an important technique in theconstruction of compilers and other language-processing devices. Of particular interest fromboth practical and theoretical considerations is how the time and memory required toprocess a language is functionally related to the length of the input sentence underconsideration. In this paper we consider languages which can be defined by pushdownstore systems. To obtain quantitative results; a two-way (off-line) nondeterministic pushdownautomaton (2N PDA; for short) is used as an analytical model of a pushdown store system;and the two-way deterministic push-down automaton (2D PDA; for short) is also consideredas a special case.,Proceedings of the 1968 23rd ACM national conference,1968,*
An Approach to a Unified Theory of Automata,JD Ullman; JE Hopcroft,Abstract A model of an automaton; called a balloon automaton is proposed; It consists of afinite control; which may be deterministic or nondeterministic; an input tape which may beone way or two way; and an abstract; infinite memory; called the balloon; which can enterany of a countable number of states. There is assumed to be a recursive function whichmanipulates the state of the balloon; and another which passes a finite amount ofinformation from the balloon to the finite control.,Bell Labs Technical Journal,1967,*

Crossroads The ACM Magazine for Students,Jeffrey D Ullman,If you are familiar with" big data;" you are probably familiar with the MapReduce approach toimplementing parallelism on computing clusters [1]. A cluster consists of many computenodes; which are processors with their associated memory and disks. The compute nodesare connected by Ethernet or switches so they can pass data from node to node.Like anyother programming model; MapReduce needs an algorithm-design theory. The theory is notjust the theory of parallel algorithms—MapReduce requires we coordinate parallelprocesses in a very specific way. A MapReduce job consists of two functions written by theprogrammer; plus some magic that happens in the middle:,*,*,*

1.1 What is Data Mining?,Jure Leskovec; Anand Rajaraman; Jeffrey David Ullman,Statisticians were the first to use the term “data mining.” Originally;“data mining” or “datadredging” was a derogatory term referring to attempts to extract information that was notsupported by the data. Section 1.2 illustrates the sort of errors one can make by trying toextract what really isn't in the data. Today;“data mining” has taken on a positive meaning.Now; statisticians view data mining as the construction of a statistical model; that is; anunderlying distribution from which the visible data is drawn. example 1.1 Suppose our datais a set of numbers. This data is much simpler than data that would be data-mined; but it willserve as an example. A statistician might decide that the data comes from a Gaussiandistribution and use a formula to compute the most likely parameters of this Gaussian. Themean and standard deviation of this Gaussian distribution completely characterize the …,*,*,*

Operating RS Gaines Systems Editor Protection in Operating Systems,Michael A Harrison; Walter L Ruzzo; Jeffrey D Ullman,Abstract A model of protection mechanisms in computing systems is presented and itsappropriateness is argued. The &quot; safety &quot; problem for protection systems underthis model is to determine in a given situation whether a subject can acquire a particularright to an object. In restricted cases; it can be shown that this problem is decidable; ie thereis an algorithm to determine whether a system in a particular configuration is safe. Ingeneral; and under surprisingly weak assumptions; it cannot be decided if a situation is safe.Various implications of this fact are discussed.,*,*,*

We introduce a distributed and generalized version of Yannakakis's algorithm;called GYM. GYM takes as input any generalized hypertree decomposition (GHD) of a queryof width w and depth d; and computes the query in O (d+ log (n)) rounds and O (n (INw+OUT) 2,*,*,*
9th Annual Symposium on Switching and Automata Theory (swat 1968),Fred L Luconi; Philip M Spira; Sheila Greibach,A checking automaton is equivalent to a one-way nonerasing stack automaton which; once itenters its stack; never again writes on its stack. The checking automaton languages (cal)form a full AFL closed under substitution. If L⊆ a* is an infinite cal; then L contains an infiniteregular set. Consequently; there are one-way nonerasing stack languages (such as (an2|n≥ 1|)) which are not cal. Let L be...,*,*,*

We need software that (1)translates and communicates project data dynamically; overcoming both logical barriers(differing views of overlapping data) and physical barriers (data distribution); and (2) detects;analyzes; and manages changes efficiently during concurrent design processes. We have asoftware prototype; KADBASE; that addresses the distributed query problem. In addition; weare adapting and applying a high-level constraint language to support distributed constraintprocessing for preliminary design.,*,*,*
TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAT MUNCHEN,Manfred Groh,Abstract The subject of this work is the evaluation of the discovery potential of the ATLASdetector at the Large Hadron Collider for the Standard Model Higgs boson in vector-bosonfusion production and a subsequent decay into a τ-lepton pair. This is one of the mostpromising discovery channels of the Higgs boson in the low mass range; which is the massrange favored from precision measurements of the electroweak interaction. The decaymodes where both τ leptons decay leptonically and where one τ lepton decays leptonicallyand the other one hadronically are studied in this thesis. The main objective was toinvestigate possible improvements upon earlier cut-based analyses by using additionaldiscriminating variables as well as by applying multivariate analysis methods which take intoaccount correlations between the variables. The variables are carefully selected in order …,*,*,*
