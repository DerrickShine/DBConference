The complexity of causality and responsibility for query answers and non-answers,Alexandra Meliou; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Katherine F Moore; Dan Suciu,Abstract An answer to a query has a well-defined lineage expression (alternatively calledhow-provenance) that explains how the answer was derived. Recent work has also shownhow to compute the lineage of a non-answer to a query. However; the cause of an answer ornon-answer is a more subtle notion and consists; in general; of only a fragment of thelineage. In this paper; we adapt Halpern; Pearl; and Chockler's recent definitions of causalityand responsibility to define the causes of answers and non-answers to queries; and theirdegree of responsibility. Responsibility captures the notion of degree of causality and servesto rank potentially many causes by their relative contributions to the effect. Then; we studythe complexity of computing causes and responsibilities for conjunctive queries. It is knownthat computing causes is NP-complete in general. Our first main result shows that all …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,118
Fusing data with correlations,Ravali Pochampally; Anish Das Sarma; Xin Luna Dong; Alexandra Meliou; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract Many applications rely on Web data and extraction systems to accomplishknowledge-driven tasks. Web information is not curated; so many sources provideinaccurate; or conflicting information. Moreover; extraction systems introduce additionalnoise to the data. We wish to automatically distinguish correct data and erroneous data forcreating a cleaner set of integrated data. Previous work has shown that a naive votingstrategy that trusts data provided by the majority or at least a certain number of sources maynot work well in the presence of copying between the sources. However; correlationbetween sources can be much broader than copying: sources may provide data fromcomplementary domains (negative correlation); extractors may focus on different types ofinformation (negative correlation); and extractors may apply common rules in extraction …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,74
Causality in databases,Alexandra Meliou; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Joseph Y Halpern; Christoph Koch; Katherine F Moore; Dan Suciu,Abstract Provenance is often used to validate data; by verifying its origin and explaining itsderivation. When searching for “causes” of tuples in the query results or in generalobservations; the analysis of lineage becomes an essential tool for providing suchjustifications. However; lineage can quickly grow very large; limiting its immediate use forproviding intuitive explanations to the user. The formal notion of causality is a more refinedconcept that identifies causes for observations based on user-defined criteria; and thatassigns to them gradual degrees of responsibility based on their respective contributions. Inthis paper; we initiate a discussion on causality in databases; give some simple definitions;and motivate this formalism through a number of example applications.,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2010,72
Lifted inference seen from the other side: The tractable features,Abhay Jha; Vibhav Gogate; Alexandra Meliou; Dan Suciu,Abstract Lifted inference algorithms for representations that combine first-order logic andprobabilistic graphical models have been the focus of much recent research. All liftedalgorithms developed to date are based on the same underlying idea: take a standardprobabilistic inference algorithm (eg; variable elimination; belief propagation etc.) andimprove its efficiency by exploiting repeated structure in the first-order model. In this paper;we propose an approach from the other side in that we use techniques from logic forprobabilistic inference. In particular; we define a set of rules that look only at the logicalrepresentation to identify models for which exact efficient inference is possible. We show thatour rules yield several new tractable classes that cannot be solved efficiently by any of theexisting techniques.,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,2010,72

Data gathering tours in sensor networks,Alexandra Meliou; David Chu; Carlos Guestrin; Joseph Hellerstein; Wei Hong,A basic task in sensor networks is to interactively gather data from a subset of the sensornodes. When data needs to be gathered from a selected set of nodes in the network; existingcommunication schemes often behave poorly. In this paper; we study the algorithmicchallenges in efficiently routing a fixed-size packet through a small number of nodes in asensor network; picking up data as the query is routed. We show that computing the optimalrouting scheme to visit a specific set of nodes is NP-complete; but we develop approximationalgorithms that produce plans with costs within a constant factor of the optimum. Weenhance the robustness of our initial approach to accommodate the practical issues oflimited-sized packets as well as network link and node failures; and examine how differentapproaches behave with dynamic changes in the network topology.

Tiresias: the database oracle for how-to queries,Alexandra Meliou; Dan Suciu,Abstract How-To queries answer fundamental data analysis questions of the form:" Howshould the input change in order to achieve the desired output". As a Reverse DataManagement problem; the evaluation of how-to queries is harder than their" forward"counterpart: hypothetical; or what-if queries. In this paper; we present Tiresias; the firstsystem that provides support for how-to queries; allowing the definition and integratedevaluation of a large set of constrained optimization problems; specifically Mixed IntegerProgramming problems; on top of a relational database system. Tiresias generates theproblem variables; constraints and objectives by issuing standard SQL statements; allowingfor its integration with any RDBMS.,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,43
Why so? or why no? functional causality for explaining query answers,Alexandra Meliou; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Katherine F Moore; Dan Suciu,Abstract: In this paper; we propose causality as a unified framework to explain queryanswers and non-answers; thus generalizing and extending several previously proposedapproaches of provenance and missing query result explanations. We develop ourframework starting from the well-studied definition of actual causes by Halpern and Pearl.After identifying some undesirable characteristics of the original definition; we proposefunctional causes as a refined definition of causality with several desirable properties. Theseproperties allow us to apply our notion of causality in a database context and apply ituniformly to define the causes of query results and their individual contributions in severalways:(i) we can model both provenance as well as non-answers;(ii) we can defineexplanations as either data in the input relations or relational operations in a query plan …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0912.5340,2009,39
Tracing data errors with view-conditioned causality,Alexandra Meliou; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Suman Nath; Dan Suciu,Abstract A surprising query result is often an indication of errors in the query or theunderlying data. Recent work suggests using causal reasoning to find explanations for thesurprising result. In practice; however; one often has multiple queries and/or multipleanswers; some of which may be considered correct and others unexpected. In this paper; wefocus on determining the causes of a set of unexpected results; possibly conditioned onsome prior knowledge of the correctness of another set of results. We call this problem View-Conditioned Causality. We adapt the definitions of causality and responsibility for the case ofmultiple answers/views and provide a non-trivial algorithm that reduces the problem offinding causes and their responsibility to a satisfiability problem that can be solved withexisting tools. We evaluate both the accuracy and effectiveness of our approach on a real …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,38
Approximating sensor network queries using in-network summaries,Alexandra Meliou; Carlos Guestrin; Joseph M Hellerstein,Abstract In this work we present new in-network techniques for communication efficientapproximate query processing in wireless sensornets. We use a model-based approach thatconstructs and maintains a spanning tree within the network; rooted at the basestation. Thetree maintains compressed summary information for each link that is used to “stub out”traversal during query processing. Our work is based on a formal model of the in-networktree construction task framed as an optimization problem. We demonstrate hardness resultsfor that problem; and develop efficient approximation algorithms for subtasks that are tooexpensive to compute exactly. We also propose efficient heuristics to accommodate a widerset of workloads; and empirically evaluate their performance and sensitivity to modelchanges.,Proceedings of the 2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks,2009,31
Reverse data management,Alexandra Meliou; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Dan Suciu,ABSTRACT Database research mainly focuses on forward-moving data flows: source data issubjected to transformations and evolves through queries; aggregations; and viewdefinitions to form a new target instance; possibly with a different schema. This ForwardParadigm underpins most data management tasks today; such as querying; data integration;data mining; etc. We contrast this forward processing with Reverse Data Management(RDM); where the action needs to be performed on the input data; on behalf of desiredoutcomes in the output data. Some data management tasks already fall under this paradigm;for example updates through views; data generation; data cleaning and repair. RDM is; bynecessity; conceptually more difficult to define; and computationally harder to achieve.Today; however; as increasingly more of the available data is derived from other data …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,29
Data x-ray: A diagnostic tool for data errors,Xiaolan Wang; Xin Luna Dong; Alexandra Meliou,Abstract A lot of systems and applications are data-driven; and the correctness of theiroperation relies heavily on the correctness of their data. While existing data cleaningtechniques can be quite effective at purging datasets of errors; they disregard the fact that alot of errors are systematic; inherent to the process that produces the data; and thus will keepoccurring unless the problem is corrected at its source. In contrast to traditional datacleaning; in this paper we focus on data diagnosis: explaining where and how the errorshappen in a data generative process. We develop a large-scale diagnostic framework calledDATA X-RAY. Our contributions are three-fold. First; we transform the diagnosis problem tothe problem of finding common properties among erroneous elements; with minimal domain-specific assumptions. Second; we use Bayesian analysis to derive a cost model that …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,20
Causality and explanations in databases,Alexandra Meliou; Sudeepa Roy; Dan Suciu,Abstract With the surge in the availability of information; there is a great demand for tools thatassist users in understanding their data. While today's exploration tools rely mostly on datavisualization; users often want to go deeper and understand the underlying causes of aparticular observation. This tutorial surveys research on causality and explanation for data-oriented applications. We will review and summarize the research thus far into causality andexplanation in the database and AI communities; giving researchers a snapshot of thecurrent state of the art on this topic; and propose a unified framework as well as directions forfuture research. We will cover both the theory of causality/explanation and someapplications; we also discuss the connections with other topics in database research likeprovenance; deletion propagation; why-not queries; and OLAP techniques.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,17
Data debugging with continuous testing,Kıvanç Muşlu; Yuriy Brun; Alexandra Meliou,Abstract Today; systems rely as heavily on data as on the software that manipulates thosedata. Errors in these systems are incredibly costly; annually resulting in multi-billion dollarlosses; and; on multiple occasions; in death. While software debugging and testing havereceived heavy research attention; less effort has been devoted to data debugging:discovering system errors caused by well-formed but incorrect data. In this paper; wepropose continuous data testing: using otherwise-idle CPU cycles to run test queries; in thebackground; as a user or database administrator modifies a database. This techniquenotifies the user or administrator about a data bug as quickly as possible after that bug isintroduced; leading to at least three benefits:(1) The bug is discovered quickly and can befixed before it is likely to cause a problem.(2) The bug is discovered while the relevant …,Proceedings of the 2013 9th Joint Meeting on Foundations of Software Engineering,2013,17
The complexity of resilience and responsibility for self-join-free conjunctive queries,Cibele Freire; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Neil Immerman; Alexandra Meliou,Abstract Several research thrusts in the area of data management have focused onunderstanding how changes in the data affect the output of a view or standing query.Example applications are explaining query results; propagating updates through views; andanonymizing datasets. An important aspect of this analysis is the problem of deleting aminimum number of tuples from the input tables to make a given Boolean query false; whichwe refer to as" the resilience of a query." In this paper; we study the complexity of resiliencefor self-join-free conjunctive queries with arbitrary functional dependencies. The cornerstoneof our work is the novel concept of triads; a simple structural property of a query that leads tothe several dichotomy results we show in this paper.

Bringing Provenance to Its Full Potential Using Causal Reasoning.,Alexandra Meliou; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Dan Suciu,Abstract Provenance information is often used to explain query results and outcomes; exploitresults of prior reasoning; and establish trust in data. The generality of the notion makes itapplicable in a variety of domains; including data warehousing [7]; curated databases [4];and various scientific applications. The recent introduction of causal reasoning in adatabase setting exploits provenance in ways that expand its applicability to more complexproblems; and establish new directions; making a step towards achieving provenance's fullpotential. In this paper we explore through a variety of examples how causality improves onprovenance information; discuss the challenges of building causality able systems; andpropose some new directions.,TaPP,2011,13
Preventing data errors with continuous testing,Kıvanç Muşlu; Yuriy Brun; Alexandra Meliou,Abstract Today; software systems that rely on data are ubiquitous; and ensuring the data'squality is an increasingly important challenge as data errors result in annual multi-billiondollar losses. While software debugging and testing have received heavy research attention;less effort has been devoted to data debugging: identifying system errors caused by well-formed but incorrect data. We present continuous data testing (CDT); a low-overhead; delay-free technique that quickly identifies likely data errors. CDT continuously executes domain-specific test queries; when a test fails; CDT unobtrusively warns the user or administrator.We implement CDT in the ConTest prototype for the PostgreSQL database managementsystem.

Scalable package queries in relational database systems,Matteo Brucato; Juan Felipe Beltran; Azza Abouzied; Alexandra Meliou,Abstract Traditional database queries follow a simple model: they define constraints thateach tuple in the result must satisfy. This model is computationally efficient; as the databasesystem can evaluate the query conditions on each tuple individually. However; manypractical; real-world problems require a collection of result tuples to satisfy constraintscollectively; rather than individually. In this paper; we present package queries; a new querymodel that extends traditional database queries to handle complex constraints andpreferences over answer sets. We develop a full-fledged package query system;implemented on top of a traditional database engine. Our work makes several contributions.First; we design PaQL; a SQL-based query language that supports the declarativespecification of package queries. We prove that PaQL is at least as expressive as integer …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,9
QFix: Diagnosing errors through query histories,Xiaolan Wang; Alexandra Meliou; Eugene Wu,Abstract Data-driven applications rely on the correctness of their data to function properlyand effectively. Errors in data can be incredibly costly and disruptive; leading to loss ofrevenue; incorrect conclusions; and misguided policy decisions. While data cleaning toolscan purge datasets of many errors before the data is used; applications and usersinteracting with the data can introduce new errors. Subsequent valid updates can obscurethese errors and propagate them through the dataset causing more discrepancies. Evenwhen some of these discrepancies are discovered; they are often corrected superficially; ona case-by-case basis; further obscuring the true underlying cause; and making detection ofthe remaining errors harder. In this paper; we propose QFix; a framework that derivesexplanations and repairs for discrepancies in relational data; by analyzing the effect of …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,5
PackageBuilder: From tuples to packages,Matteo Brucato; Rahul Ramakrishna; Azza Abouzied; Alexandra Meliou,Abstract In this demo; we present PackageBuilder; a system that extends database systemsto support package queries. A package is a collection of tuples that individually satisfy baseconstraints and collectively satisfy global constraints. The need for package support arises ina variety of scenarios: For example; in the creation of meal plans; users are not onlyinterested in the nutritional content of individual meals (base constraints); but also care tospecify daily consumption limits and control the balance of the entire plan (globalconstraints). We introduce PaQL; a declarative SQL-based package query language; andthe interface abstractions which allow users to interactively specify package queries andeasily navigate through their results. To efficiently evaluate queries; the system employspruning and heuristics; as well as state-of-the-art constraint optimization solvers. We …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,4

Modeling and manipulating the structure of hierarchical schemas for the web,Theodore Dalamagas; Alexandra Meliou; Timos Sellis,Abstract The Semantic Web is the next step of the current Web where information willbecome more machine-understandable to support effective data discovery and integration.Hierarchical schemas; either in the form of tree-like structures (eg; DTDs; XML schemas); orin the form of hierarchies on a category/subcategory basis (eg; thematic hierarchies of portalcatalogs); play an important role in this task. They are used to enrich semantically theavailable information. Up to now; hierarchical schemas have been treated rather as sets ofindividual elements; acting as semantic guides for browsing or querying data. Under thatview; queries like “find the part of a portal catalog which is not present in another catalog”can be answered only in a procedural way; specifying which nodes to select and how to getthem. For this reason; we argue that hierarchical schemas should be treated as full …,Information Sciences,2008,4
Default-all is dangerous!,Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Alexandra Meliou; Dan Suciu,Abstract We show that the default-all propagation scheme for database annotations isdangerous. Dangerous here means that it can propagate annotations to the query outputwhich are semantically irrelevant to the query the user asked. This is the result ofconsidering all relationally equivalent queries and returning the union of their where-provenance in an attempt to define a propagation scheme that is insensitive to queryrewriting. We propose an alternative query-rewrite-insensitive (QRI) where-provenancecalled minimal propagation. It is analogous to the minimal witness basis for whyprovenance;straight-forward to evaluate; and returns all relevant and only relevant annotations.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1105.4395,2011,3
Fairness testing: testing software for discrimination,Sainyam Galhotra; Yuriy Brun; Alexandra Meliou,Abstract This paper defines software fairness and discrimination and develops a testing-based method for measuring if and how much software discriminates; focusing on causalityin discriminatory behavior. Evidence of software discrimination has been found in modernsoftware systems that recommend criminal sentences; grant access to financial products;and determine who is allowed to participate in promotions. Our approach; Themis;generates efficient test suites to measure discrimination. Given a schema describing validsystem inputs; Themis generates discrimination tests automatically and does not require anoracle. We evaluate Themis on 20 software systems; 12 of which come from prior work withexplicit focus on avoiding discrimination. We find that (1) Themis is effective at discoveringsoftware discrimination;(2) state-of-the-art techniques for removing discrimination from …,Proceedings of the 2017 11th Joint Meeting on Foundations of Software Engineering,2017,2
A consumer-centric market for database computation in the cloud,Yue Wang; Alexandra Meliou; Gerome Miklau,Abstract: The availability of public computing resources in the cloud has revolutionized dataanalysis; but requesting cloud resources often involves complex decisions for consumers.Under the current pricing mechanisms; cloud service providers offer several service optionsand charge consumers based on the resources they use. Before they can decide whichcloud resources to request; consumers have to estimate the completion time and cost of theircomputational tasks for different service options and possibly for different service providers.This estimation is challenging even for expert cloud users. We propose a new market-basedframework for pricing computational tasks in the cloud. Our framework introduces an agentbetween consumers and cloud providers. The agent takes data and computational tasksfrom users; estimates time and cost for evaluating the tasks; and returns to consumers …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.02104,2016,2

However; while traditional data cleaning techniquescan be effective at identifying several data discrepancies; they disregard the fact that manyerrors are systematic; inherent to the process that produces the data; and thus will keepoccurring unless the root cause is identified and corrected. In this demonstration; we willpresent a large-scale diagnostic framework called D ata XR ay.

Tiresias: a demonstration of how-to queries,Alexandra Meliou; Yisong Song; Dan Suciu,Abstract In this demo; we will present Tiresias; the first how-to query engine. How-to queriesrepresent fundamental data analysis questions of the form:" How should the input change inorder to achieve the desired output". They exemplify an important Reverse DataManagement problem: solving constrained optimization problems over data residing in aDBMS. Tiresias; named after the mythical oracle of Thebes; has complex under-workings;but includes a simple interface that allows users to load datasets and interactively designoptimization problems by simply selecting actions; key performance indicators; andobjectives. The user choices are translated into a declarative query; which is then processedby Tiresias and translated into a Mixed Integer Program: we then use an MIP solver to find asolution. The solution is then presented to the user as an interactive data instance. The …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,2
Multiresolution Cube Estimators for Sensor Network Aggregate Queries,Alexandra Meliou; Carlos Guestrin; Joseph M Hellerstein,Abstract: In this work we present in-network techniques to improve the efficiency of spatialaggregate queries. Such queries are very common in a sensornet setting; demanding moretargeted techniques for their handling. Our approach constructs and maintains multi-resolution cube hierarchies inside the network; which can be constructed in a distributedfashion. In case of failures; recovery can also be performed with in-network decisions. In thispaper we demonstrate how in-network cube hierarchies can be used to summarize sensordata; and how they can be exploited to improve the efficiency of spatial aggregate queries.We show that query plans over our cube summaries can be computed in polynomial time;and we present a PTIME algorithm that selects the minimum number of data requests thatcan compute the answer to a spatial query. We further extend our algorithm to handle …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1007.3781,2010,2

Modeling and manipulating the structure of portal catalogs,Theodore Dalamagas; Alexandra Meliou; Timos Sellis,Abstract Portal catalog sites are Web information nodes that provide querying and browsingcapabilities on data organized in a thematic hierarchy. Up to now; portal catalogs have notbeen treated as full-fledged objects so as to allow for their manipulation. A major challengeis thus to complement catalog search and browsing with operations that manipulatestructural information from similar vertical portal catalog sites; that is sites of a specificsubject or domain. This work proposes models and operators that allow for structuralmanipulation of vertical portal catalog sites; considering them as first-class citizens in theinformation search space. First; we explore the algebraic properties of trees representinghierarchies of portal catalogs; and define a lattice algebraic structure on them.

Even when data is cleaned; new errors canbe introduced by applications and users who interact with the data.

A Scalable Execution Engine for Package Queries,Matteo Brucato; Azza Abouzied; Alexandra Meliou,Abstract Many modern applications and real-world problems involve the design of itemcollections; or packages: from planning your daily meals all the way to mapping theuniverse. Despite the pervasive need for packages; traditional data management does notoffer support for their definition and computation. This is because traditional databasequeries follow a powerful; but very simple model: a query defines constraints that each tuplein the result must satisfy. However; a system tasked with the design of packages cannotconsider items independently; rather; the system needs to determine if a set of itemscollectively satisfy given criteria. In this paper; we present package queries; a new querymodel that extends traditional database queries to handle complex constraints andpreferences over answer sets.

Improving package recommendations through query relaxation,Matteo Brucato; Azza Abouzied; Alexandra Meliou,Abstract Recommendation systems aim to identify items that are likely to be of interest tousers. In many cases; users are interested in package recommendations as collections ofitems. For example; a dietitian may wish to derive a dietary plan as a collection of recipesthat is nutritionally balanced; and a travel agent may want to produce a vacation package asa coordinated collection of travel and hotel reservations. Recent work has exploredextending recommendation systems to support packages of items.

PackageBuilder: Querying for packages of tuples,Kevin Fernandes; Matteo Brucato; Rahul Ramakrishna; Azza Abouzied; Alexandra Meliou,Abstract PackageBuilder is a system that extends query engines to support packagegeneration. A package is a collection of tuples with certain global properties defined on thecollection as a whole. In contrast to traditional query answers where each answer tupleneeds to satisfy the query predicates; each answer package needs to satisfy globalconstraints on the collection of tuples: eg; a package of recipes that collectively do notexceed 2;200 calories. PackageBuilder introduces simple extensions to the SQL languageto support package-level predicates; and includes a simple interface that allows users toload datasets and interactively specify package queries.

Lifted inference seen from the other side,Abhay Jha; Vibhav Gogate; Alexandra Meliou; Dan Suciu,Abstract Lifted Inference algorithms for representations that combine first-order logic andgraphical models have been the focus of much recent research. All lifted algorithmsdeveloped to date are based on the same underlying idea: take a standard probabilisticinference algorithm (eg; variable elimination; belief propagation etc.) and improve itsefficiency by exploiting repeated structure in the first-order model. In this paper; we proposean approach from the other side in that we use techniques from logic for probabilisticinference. In particular; we define a set of rules that look only at the logical representation toidentify models for which exact efficient inference is possible. Our rules yield new tractableclasses that could not be solved efficiently by any of the existing techniques.,24th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2010; NIPS 2010,2010,*
Parallel Earthquake Simulation,George Petropoulos; Shawn Jeffery; Alexandra Meliou,Abstract The simulation of structural and geotechnical systems is a critical step in theirdesign and assessment. The purpose of an earthquake simulation is to estimate theperformance of the system under seismic excitation or loads that represent the effects of anearthquake. Structural and geotechnical simulation has a long history of development inearthquake engineering. The computation required to perform large scale simulations;however; is not suitable to be handled sequentially. Parallelization is therefore a crucial stepin earthquake simulation analysis. Here; we present an analysis of the current state-of-the-art earthquake simulation package; OpenSees; suitably extended for parallel processing.,*,2005,*

The Power of How-To Queries,Alexandra Meliou,Informally; a data transformation consists of a function from an input data source to a targetoutput. The natural evolution of data follows the directionality of the transformations; ie; fromsource to target. Database research mainly focuses on forward-moving data flows: Sourcedata is subjected to transformations and evolves through queries; aggregations; and viewdefinitions to form a new target instance; possibly with a different schema. This forwardparadigm underpins most data management tasks today; such as querying; data integration;data mining; etc. In contrast; in reverse data management [11]; one needs to act on the inputdata in order to achieve a desired effect in the output. Some data management tasks alreadyfall under this paradigm. Examples include updating through views [7]; data generation [5];causality computation [10]; data cleaning [2]. All these problems share a common premise …,*,*,*
