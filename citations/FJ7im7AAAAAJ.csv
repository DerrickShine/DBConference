Utility-driven data acquisition in participatory sensing,Mehdi Riahi; Thanasis G Papaioannou; Immanuel Trummer; Karl Aberer,Abstract Participatory sensing (PS) is becoming a popular data acquisition means forinteresting emerging applications. However; as data queries from these applicationsincrease; the sustainability of this platform for multiple concurrent applications is at stake. Inthis paper; we consider the problem of efficient data acquisition in PS when queries ofdifferent types come from different applications. We effectively deal with the issues related toresource constraints; user privacy; data reliability; and uncontrolled mobility. We formulatethe problem as multi-query optimization and propose efficient heuristics for its effectivesolution for the various query types and mixes that enable sustainable sensing. Based onsimulations with real and artificial data traces; we found that our heuristic algorithmsoutperform baseline approaches in a multitude of settings considered.,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,37
Cost-optimal outsourcing of applications into the clouds,Immanuel Trummer; Frank Leymann; Ralph Mietzner; Walter Binder,Commercial services for provisioning software components and virtual infrastructure in thecloud are emerging. For customers; this creates a multitude of possibilities for outsourcingpart of the IT-stack to third parties in order to run their applications. These possibilities areassociated with different running costs; so cloud customers have to determine the optimalsolution. In this paper; we present and experimentally evaluate an algorithm that solves thecorresponding optimization problem. We assume that applications are described astemplates; fixing the deployment structure and constraining the properties of the used soft-and hardware components. Different parts of the application may be outsourced to differentproviders and several levels of outsourcing can be considered. However; dependenciesbetween different parts of the application have to be respected.

Multi-objective quality-driven service selection—a fully polynomial time approximation scheme,Immanuel Trummer; Boi Faltings; Walter Binder,The goal of multi-objective quality-driven service selection (QDSS) is to find serviceselections for a workflow whose quality-of-service (QoS) values are Pareto-optimal. Weconsider multiple QoS attributes such as response time; cost; and reliability. A selection isPareto-optimal if no other selection has better QoS values for some attributes and at leastequivalent values for all others. Exact algorithms have been proposed that find all Pareto-optimal selections. They suffer however from exponential complexity. Randomizedalgorithms scale well but do not offer any formal guarantees on result precision. We presentthe first approximation scheme for QDSS. It aims at the sweet spot between exact andrandomized algorithms: It combines polynomial complexity with formal result precisionguarantees. A parameter allows to seamlessly trade result precision against efficiency …,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,2014,21
Approximation Schemes for Many-Objective Query Optimization,Immanuel Trummer; Christoph Koch,Abstract The goal of multi-objective query optimization (MOQO) is to find query plans thatrealize a good compromise between conflicting objectives such as minimizing executiontime and minimizing monetary fees in a Cloud scenario. A previously proposed exhaustiveMOQO algorithm needs hours to optimize even simple TPC-H queries. This is why wepropose several approximation schemes for MOQO that generate guaranteed near-optimalplans in seconds where exhaustive optimization takes hours. We integrated all MOQOalgorithms into the Postgres optimizer and present experimental results for TPC-H queries;we extended the Postgres cost model and optimize for up to nine conflicting objectives in ourexperiments. The proposed algorithms are based on a formal analysis of typical costfunctions that occur in the context of MOQO. We identify properties that hold for a broad …,SIGMOD 2014,2014,21
Multi-objective parametric query optimization,Immanuel Trummer; Christoph Koch,Abstract Classical query optimization compares query plans according to one cost metricand associates each plan with a constant cost value. In this paper; we introduce the Multi-Objective Parametric Query Optimization (MPQ) problem where query plans are comparedaccording to multiple cost metrics and the cost of a given plan according to a given metric ismodeled as a function that depends on multiple parameters. The cost metrics may forinstance include execution time or monetary fees; a parameter may represent the selectivityof a query predicate that is unspecified at optimization time. MPQ generalizes parametricquery optimization (which allows multiple parameters but only one cost metric) and multi-objective query optimization (which allows multiple cost metrics but no parameters). Weformally analyze the novel MPQ problem and show why existing algorithms are …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,20
An incremental anytime algorithm for multi-objective query optimization,Immanuel Trummer; Christoph Koch,Abstract Query plans offer diverse tradeoffs between conflicting cost metrics such asexecution time; energy consumption; or execution fees in a multi-objective scenario. It isconvenient for users to choose the desired cost tradeoff in an interactive process;dynamically adding constraints and finally selecting the best plan based on a continuouslyrefined visualization of optimal cost tradeoffs. Multi-objective query optimization (MOQO)algorithms must possess specific properties to support such an interactive process: First;they must be anytime algorithms; generating multiple result plan sets of increasing qualitywith low latency between consecutive results. Second; they must be incremental; meaningthat they avoid regenerating query plans when being invoked several times for the samequery but with slightly different user constraints. We present an incremental anytime …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,15
Multiple query optimization on the D-Wave 2X adiabatic quantum computer,Immanuel Trummer; Christoph Koch,Abstract The D-Wave adiabatic quantum annealer solves hard combinatorial optimizationproblems leveraging quantum physics. The newest version features over 1000 qubits andwas released in August 2015. We were given access to such a machine; currently hosted atNASA Ames Research Center in California; to explore the potential for hard optimizationproblems that arise in the context of databases. In this paper; we tackle the problem ofmultiple query optimization (MQO). We show how an MQO problem instance can betransformed into a mathematical formula that complies with the restrictive input formataccepted by the quantum annealer. This formula is translated into weights on and betweenqubits such that the configuration minimizing the input formula can be found via a processcalled adiabatic quantum annealing.

Mining subjective properties on the web,Immanuel Trummer; Alon Halevy; Hongrae Lee; Sunita Sarawagi; Rahul Gupta,Abstract Even with the recent developments in Web search of answering queries fromstructured data; search engines are still limited to queries with an objective answer; such asEUROPEAN CAPITALS or WOODY ALLEN MOVIES. However; many queries are subjective;such as SAFE CITIES; or CUTE ANIMALS. The underlying knowledge bases of searchengines do not contain answers to these queries because they do not have a ground truth.We describe the Surveyor system that mines the dominant opinion held by authors of Webcontent about whether a subjective property applies to a given entity. The evidence on whichSURVEYOR relies is statements extracted from Web text that either support the property orclaim its negation. The key challenge that SURVEYOR faces is that simply counting thenumber of positive and negative statements does not suffice; because there are multiple …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,9
Towards self-organizing service-oriented architectures,Walter Binder; Daniele Bonetta; Cesare Pautasso; Achille Peternier; Diego Milano; Heiko Schuldt; Nenad Stojnic; Boi Faltings; Immanuel Trummer,Service-oriented architectures (SOAs) provide a successful model for structuring complexdistributed software systems; as they reduce the cost of ownership and ease the creation ofnew applications by composing existing services. However; currently; the development ofservice-oriented applications requires many manual tasks and prevailing infrastructure isoften based on centralized components that are central points of failure and easily becomebottlenecks. In this paper; we promote self-organizing SOA as a new approach to overcomethese limitations. Self-organizing SOA integrates research results in the areas of autonomicand service oriented computing. We consider self-organizing features for the whole life-cycleof a service-oriented application; from the creation to the execution; optimization; andmonitoring.,Services (SERVICES); 2011 IEEE World Congress on,2011,7
A Fast Randomized Algorithm for Multi-Objective Query Optimization,Immanuel Trummer; Christoph Koch,Abstract Query plans are compared according to multiple cost metrics in multi-objectivequery optimization. The goal is to find the set of Pareto plans realizing optimal cost tradeoffsfor a given query. So far; only algorithms with exponential complexity in the number of querytables have been proposed for multi-objective query optimization. In this work; we presentthe first algorithm with polynomial complexity in the query size. Our algorithm is randomizedand iterative. It improves query plans via a multi-objective version of hill climbing that appliesmultiple transformations in each climbing step for maximal efficiency. Based on a locallyoptimal plan; we approximate the Pareto plan set within the restricted space of plans withsimilar join orders. We maintain a cache of Pareto-optimal plans for each potentially usefulintermediate result to share partial plans that were discovered in different iterations.

Optimizing the tradeoff between discovery; composition; and execution cost in service composition,Immanuel Trummer; Boi Faltings,Quality-aware service composition starts from an abstract workflow. The tasks of theworkflow are associated with functional types for which concrete services can be retrievedfrom a registry. Abstract tasks have to be mapped to concrete services before the workflow isexecuted. The goal is to maximize the workflow quality by choosing the right combination ofservices. Spending more time in discovery and composition will increase the quality of theresulting workflow. Restricted resources motivate however the question about the optimaltradeoff between composition effort and solution quality. In this paper; we aggregate thethree phases discovery; composition; and execution into a common cost metric. We motivatewhy this cost metric may dynamically change depending on the system state and theproperties of the workflow at hand. We present and analyze an iterative algorithm that …,Web Services (ICWS); 2011 IEEE International Conference on,2011,4
Parallelizing query optimization on shared-nothing architectures,Immanuel Trummer; Christoph Koch,Abstract Data processing systems offer an ever increasing degree of parallelism on thelevels of cores; CPUs; and processing nodes. Query optimization must exploit high degreesof parallelism in order not to gradually become the bottleneck of query evaluation. We showhow to parallelize query optimization at a massive scale. We present algorithms for parallelquery optimization in left-deep and bushy plan spaces. At optimization start; we divide theplan space for a given query into partitions of equal size that are explored in parallel byworker nodes. At the end of optimization; each worker returns the optimal plan in its partitionto the master which determines the globally optimal plan from the partition-optimal plans. Nosynchronization or data exchange is required during the actual optimization phase.

Method for multi-objective quality-driven service selection,*,This invention relates to the field of multi-objective workflow optimization. Certain exemplaryembodiments of the invention are applicable in cases where workflow descriptions containchoice variables relating for instance to the selection of a specific service provider out ofseveral service providers that provide similar services; to the selection of human workers; orto the selection between alternative subworkflows. A binding represents a combination ofchoices; binding the choice variables to specific values. Bindings induce specific cost and/orquality properties to the workflow; a binding being Pareto-optimal if no other binding existsthat is at least as good for every cost and/or quality property and better for at least oneproperty. Certain exemplary embodiments relate to a system and/or computer-implementedmethod for computing an approximation of the set of Pareto-optimal bindings such that …,*,2013,3
The magazine archive includes every article published in Communications of the ACM for over the past 50 years.,Guy Kindler; Anup Rao; Ryan O'Donnell; Avi Wigderson,Foam problems are about how to best partition space into bubbles of minimal surface area.We investigate the case where one unit-volume bubble is required to tile d-dimensionalspace in a periodic fashion according to the standard; cubical lattice. While a cube requiressurface area 2d; we construct such a bubble having surface area very close to that of asphere; that is; proportional to cacm5510_b. gif (the minimum possible even without theconstraint of being periodic). Our method for constructing this" spherical cube" is inspired byfoundational questions in the theory of computation related to the concept of hardnessamplification. Our methods give new algorithms for" coordinated discretization" of high-dimensional data points; which have near-optimal noise resistance. We also provide themost efficient known cubical foam in three dimensions.,Communications of the ACM,*,3
Probably Approximately Optimal Query Optimization,Immanuel Trummer; Christoph Koch,Abstract: Evaluating query predicates on data samples is the only way to estimate theirselectivity in certain scenarios. Finding a guaranteed optimal query plan is not a reasonableoptimization goal in those cases as it might require an infinite number of samples. Wetherefore introduce probably approximately optimal query optimization (PAO) where the goalis to find a query plan whose cost is near-optimal with a certain probability. We will justifywhy PAO is a suitable formalism to model scenarios in which predicate sampling andoptimization need to be interleaved. We present the first algorithm for PAO. Our algorithm isnon-intrusive and uses standard query optimizers and sampling components as sub-functions. It is generic and can be applied to a wide range of scenarios. Our algorithm isiterative and calculates in each iteration a query plan together with a region in the …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.01782,2015,2
Dynamically selecting composition algorithms for economical composition as a service,Immanuel Trummer; Boi Faltings,Abstract Various algorithms have been proposed for the problem of quality-driven servicecomposition. They differ by the quality of the resulting executable processes and by theirprocessing costs. In this paper; we study the problem of service composition from aneconomical point of view and adopt the perspective of a Composition as a Service provider.Our goal is to minimize composition costs while delivering executable workflows of aspecified average quality. We propose to dynamically select different composition algorithmsfor different workflow templates based upon template structure and workflow priority. Forevaluating our selection algorithm; we consider two classic approaches to quality-drivencomposition; genetic algorithms and integer linear programming with different parametersettings.

Data vocalization: optimizing voice output of relational data,Immanuel Trummer; Jiancheng Zhu; Mark Bryan,Abstract Research on data visualization aims at finding the best way to present data viavisual interfaces. We introduce the complementary problem of" data vocalization". Our goalis to present relational data in the most efficient way via voice output. This problem setting ismotivated by emerging tools and devices (eg; Google Home; Amazon Echo; Apple's Siri; orvoice-based SQL interfaces) that communicate data primarily via audio output to their users.We treat voice output generation as an optimization problem. The goal is to minimizespeaking time while transmitting an approximation of a relational table to the user.

Solving the Join Ordering Problem via Mixed Integer Linear Programming,Immanuel Trummer; Christoph Koch,Abstract We transform join ordering into a mixed integer linear program (MILP). This allowsto address query optimization by mature MILP solver implementations that have evolvedover decades and steadily improved their performance. They offer features such as anytimeoptimization and parallel search that are highly relevant for query optimization. We present aMILP formulation for searching left-deep query plans. We use sets of binary variables torepresent join operands and intermediate results; operator implementation choices or thepresence of interesting orders. Linear constraints restrict value assignments to the onesrepresenting valid query plans. We approximate the cost of scan and join operations vialinear functions; allowing to increase approximation precision up to arbitrary degrees.

From Massive Parallelization to Quantum Computing: Seven Novel Approaches to Query Optimization,Immanuel Trummer,Abstract The goal of query optimization is to map a declarative query (describing data togenerate) to a query plan (describing how to generate the data) with optimal execution cost.Query optimization is required to support declarative query interfaces. It is a core problem inthe area of database systems and has received tremendous attention in the researchcommunity; starting with an initial publication in 1979. In this thesis; we revisit the queryoptimization problem. This visit is motivated by several developments that change thecontext of query optimization. That change is not reflected in prior literature. First; advancesin query execution platforms and processing techniques have changed the context of queryoptimization.

Along with discoveriesand civilization evolution; some words disappear and others emerge. Moreover; the 21stcentury is characterized by secondary source documents that influence us in our way ofexpressing ourselves. Thus; our study tries to define the features that could prove that thereis a linguistic drift and to quantify the changes with a metric.

The RADO approach to Quality-Driven Service Composition-Approximating the Pareto-Frontier in Polynomial Time,Immanuel Trummer; Boi Faltings,ABSTRACT In Quality-Driven Service Composition; tasks from an abstract workflow areassigned to concrete services such that workflow QoS are optimized. The following threeproperties are desirable for a corresponding algorithm. First; the run time is ideally boundedby a polynomial in the number of workflow tasks and service candidates. Second; thealgorithm provides formal guarantees on how close the returned solution is to the optimalone. Third; the algorithm is able to return a representative set of Pareto-optimal solutionsinstead of only one. The user can choose among them or apply arbitrary filter or sortoperations in successive steps. We present the first algorithm that has all three features. Weanalyze its formal properties and evaluate the algorithm experimentally. We find that ouralgorithm is competitive from the theoretical as well as from the practical perspective.,*,2012,*

DA_Trummer2,Immanuel Trummer,In a Software as a Service (SaaS) scenario; customers use software that is hosted andmanaged by a third party; the SaaS provider. Typically this software is run in a remote datacenter and accessed via the Internet. Customers may subscribe and unsubscribe to such anapplication and pay only for the actual use of the software. The SaaS provider on the otherhand can exploit economies of scale by offering the same application to many customers.The process by which an application is made available to customers is called provisioning.For provisioning an application; SaaS providers can exploit resources that are already inuse by other customers; create new resources on their own premises or outsource part of theapplication again to a third party.
