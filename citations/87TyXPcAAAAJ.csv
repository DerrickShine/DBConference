Thinking about computational thinking,James J Lu; George HL Fletcher,Abstract Jeannette Wing's call for teaching Computational Thinking (CT) as a formative skillon par with reading; writing; and arithmetic places computer science in the category of basicknowledge. Just as proficiency in basic language arts helps us to effectively communicateand in basic math helps us to successfully quantitate; proficiency in computational thinkinghelps us to systematically and efficiently process information and tasks. But while teachingeveryone to think computationally is a noble goal; there are pedagogical challenges.Perhaps the most confounding issue is the role of programming; and whether we canseparate it from teaching basic computer science. How much programming; if any; should berequired for CT proficiency? We believe that to successfully broaden participation incomputer science; efforts must be made to lay the foundations of CT long before students …,ACM SIGCSE Bulletin,2009,145
Identifying a result responsive to a current location of a client device,*,A method for identifying a result responsive to a current location of a client device includesreceiving; form a client device and at a host; a search query that includes a point of interestand a current location of the client device. The method also includes automatically updatingthe search query as the current location of the client device changes and instructing the hostto identify a potential location associated with the point of interest and located within a user-defined proximity from the current location of the client device.,*,2010,81
Unstructured peer-to-peer networks: Topological properties and search performance,George HL Fletcher; Hardik A Sheth; Katy Börner,Abstract Performing efficient decentralized search is a fundamental problem in Peer-to-Peer(P2P) systems. There has been a significant amount of research recently on developingrobust self-organizing P2P topologies that support efficient search. In this paper we discussfour structured and unstructured P2P models (CAN; Chord; PRU; and Hypergrid) and threecharacteristic search algorithms (BFS; k-Random Walk; and GAPS) for unstructurednetworks. We report on the results of simulations of these networks and providemeasurements of search performance; focusing on search in unstructured networks. We findthat the proposed models produce small-world networks; and yet none exhibit power-lawdegree distributions. Our simulations also suggest that random graphs supportdecentralized search more effectively than the proposed unstructured P2P models. We …,International Workshop on Agents and P2P Computing,2004,66
Scalable indexing of RDF graphs for efficient join processing,George HL Fletcher; Peter W Beck,Abstract Current approaches to RDF graph indexing suffer from weak data locality; ie;information regarding a piece of data appears in multiple locations; spanning multiple datastructures. Weak data locality negatively impacts storage and query processing costs.Towards stronger data locality; we propose a Three-way Triple Tree (TripleT) secondarymemory indexing technique to facilitate flexible and efficient join evaluation on RDF data.The novelty of TripleT is that the index is built over the atoms occurring in the data set; ratherthan at a coarser granularity; such as whole triples occurring in the data set; and; the atomsare indexed regardless of the roles (ie; subjects; predicates; or objects) they play in thetriples of the data set. We show through extensive empirical evaluation that TripleT exhibitsmultiple orders of magnitude improvement over the state-of-the-art; in terms of both …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,59
Mapping data sources to xes in a generic way,JCAM Buijs,Abstract Information systems are taking a prominent place in today's business processexecution. Since most systems are complex; enterprise-wide systems; very few users; if any;have a clear and complete view of the overall process. In the area of process mining severaltechniques have been developed to reverse engineer information about a process from arecording of its execution. To apply process mining analysis on process-aware informationsystems; an event log is required. An event log contains information about cases and theevents that are executed on them. Although many systems produce event logs; mostsystems use their own event log format. Furthermore; the information contained in theseevent logs is not always suitable for process mining. However; since much data is stored inthe data storage of the information system; it is often possible to reconstruct an event log …,Maters Thesis,2010,52
Education Human computing skills: rethinking the K-12 experience,George HL Fletcher; James J Lu,While being educated implies proficiency in basic language and quantitative skills; it doesnot imply knowledge of or the ability to carry out scholarly English and mathematics. Indeed;for those students interested in pursuing higher-level English and mathematics; there existmilestone courses to help make the critical intellectual leaps necessary to shift from thedevelopment of useful skills to the academic study of these subjects. Analogously; webelieve the same dichotomy exists between CT; as a skill; and computer science as anacademic subject. Our thesis is this: Programming is to CS what proof construction is tomathematics and what literary analysis is to English. The shift to the study of CS as anacademic subject cannot; of course; be achieved without intense immersion in craftingprograms. In this respect; the traditional programming-first curriculum is appropriate …,Communications of the ACM,2009,52
Relative expressive power of navigational querying on graphs,George HL Fletcher; Marc Gyssens; Dirk Leinders; Dimitri Surinx; Jan Van den Bussche; Dirk Van Gucht; Stijn Vansummeren; Yuqing Wu,Abstract Motivated by both established and new applications; we study navigational querylanguages for graphs (binary relations). The simplest language has only the two operatorsunion and composition; together with the identity relation. We make more powerfullanguages by adding any of the following operators: intersection; set difference; projection;coprojection; converse; and the diversity relation. All these operators map binary relations tobinary relations. We compare the expressive power of all resulting languages. We do thisnot only for general path queries (queries where the result may be any binary relation) butalso for boolean or yes/no queries (expressed by the nonemptiness of an expression). Forboth cases; we present the complete Hasse diagram of relative expressiveness. In particularthe Hasse diagram for boolean queries contains some nontrivial separations and a few …,Information sciences,2015,45
A structural approach to indexing triples,François Picalausa; Yongming Luo; George HL Fletcher; Jan Hidders; Stijn Vansummeren,Abstract As an essential part of the W3C's semantic web stack and linked data initiative; RDFdata management systems (also known as triplestores) have drawn a lot of researchattention. The majority of these systems use value-based indexes (eg; B+-trees) for physicalstorage; and ignore many of the structural aspects present in RDF graphs. Structuralindexes; on the other hand; have been successfully applied in XML and semi-structureddata management to exploit structural graph information in query processing. In thosesettings; a structural index groups nodes in a graph based on some equivalence criterion;for example; indistinguishability with respect to some query workload (usually XPath).Motivated by this body of work; we have started the SAINT-DB project to study and develop anative RDF management system based on structural indexes. In this paper we present a …,Extended Semantic Web Conference,2012,43
Structural characterizations of the semantics of XPath as navigation tool on a document,Marc Gyssens; Jan Paredaens; Dirk Van Gucht; George HL Fletcher,Abstract Given a document D in the form of an unordered labeled tree; we study theexpressibility on D of various fragments of XPath; the core navigational language on XMLdocuments. We give characterizations; in terms of the structure of D; for when a binaryrelation on its nodes is definable by an XPath expression in these fragments. Since eachpair of nodes in such a relation represents a unique path in D; our results therefore capturethe sets of paths in D definable in XPath. We refer to this perspective on the semantics ofXPath as the" global view." In contrast with this global view; there is also a" local view" whereone is interested in the nodes to which one can navigate starting from a particular node inthe document. In this view; we characterize when a set of nodes in D can be defined as theresult of applying an XPath expression to a given node of D. All these definability results …,Proceedings of the twenty-fifth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2006,40
Storing and indexing massive RDF datasets,Yongming Luo; François Picalausa; George HL Fletcher; Jan Hidders; Stijn Vansummeren,Abstract The resource description framework (RDF for short) provides a flexible method formodeling information on the Web [34; 40].

gMark: schema-driven generation of graphs and queries,Guillaume Bagan; Angela Bonifati; Radu Ciucanu; George HL Fletcher; Aurélien Lemay; Nicky Advokaat,Massive graph data sets are pervasive in contemporary application domains. Hence; graphdatabase systems are becoming increasingly important. In the experimental study of thesesystems; it is vital that the research community has shared solutions for the generation ofdatabase instances and query workloads having predictable and controllable properties. Inthis paper; we present the design and engineering principles of gMark; a domainand querylanguage-independent graph instance and query workload generator. A core contribution ofgMark is its ability to target and control the diversity of properties of both the generatedinstances and the generated workloads coupled to these instances. Further noveltiesinclude support for regular path queries; a fundamental graph query paradigm; and schema-driven selectivity estimation of queries; a key feature in controlling workload chokepoints …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2017,25
On the expressive power of the relational algebra on finite sets of relation pairs,George HL Fletcher; Marc Gyssens; Jan Paredaens; Dirk Van Gucht,We give a language-independent characterization of the expressive power of the relationalalgebra on finite sets of source-target relation instance pairs. The associated decisionproblem is shown to be co-graph-isomorphism hard and in co NP. The main result is alsoapplied in providing a new characterization of the generic relational queries.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2009,23
Efficient inclusion for a class of XML types with interleaving and counting,Dario Colazzo; Giorgio Ghelli; Carlo Sartiani,Abstract Inclusion between XML types is important but expensive; and is much moreexpensive when unordered types are considered. We prove here that inclusion for XMLtypes with interleaving and counting can be decided in polynomial time in the presence oftwo important restrictions: no element appears twice in the same content model; and Kleenestar is only applied to disjunctions of single elements. Our approach is based on thetransformation of each such content model into a set of constraints that completelycharacterizes the generated language. We then reduce inclusion checking to constraintimplication. We exhibit a quadratic algorithm to perform inclusion checking on a RAMmachine.,Information Systems,2009,22
A methodology for coupling fragments of XPath with structural indexes for XML documents,George HL Fletcher; Dirk Van Gucht; Yuqing Wu; Marc Gyssens; Sofía Brenes; Jan Paredaens,Abstract We introduce a new methodology for coupling language-induced partitions andindex-induced partitions on XML documents that is aimed for the benefit of efficientevaluation of XPath queries. In particular; we identify XPath fragments which are ideallycoupled with the newly introduced P (k)-partition which has its definition grounded in thewell-known A (k) structural index and its associated partition. We then utilize these couplingsto investigate fundamental questions about the use of structural indexes in XPath queryevaluation.,Information Systems,2009,22
Towards a theory of search queries,George HL Fletcher; Jan Van den Bussche; Dirk Van Gucht; Stijn Vansummeren,Abstract The need to manage diverse information sources has triggered the rise of veryloosely structured data models; known as dataspace models. Such information managementsystems must allow querying in simple ways; mostly by a form of searching. Motivated bythese developments; we propose a theory of search queries in a general model ofdataspaces. In this model; a dataspace is a collection of data objects; where each dataobject is a collection of data items. Basic search queries are expressed using filters on dataitems; following the basic model of Boolean search in information retrieval. We characterizesemantically the class of queries that can be expressed by searching. We apply our theory toclassical relational databases; where we connect search queries to the known class of fullygeneric queries; and to dataspaces where data items are formed by attribute-value pairs …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2010,21
Efficient external-memory bisimulation on DAGs,Jelle Hellings; George HL Fletcher; Herman Haverkort,Abstract In this paper we introduce the first efficient external-memory algorithm to computethe bisimilarity equivalence classes of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). DAGs are commonlyused to model data in a wide variety of practical applications; ranging from XML documentsand data provenance models; to web taxonomies and scientific workflows. In the study ofefficient reasoning over massive graphs; the notion of node bisimilarity plays a central role.For example; grouping together bisimilar nodes in an XML data set is the first step in manysophisticated approaches to building indexing data structures for efficient XPath queryevaluation. To date; however; only internal-memory bisimulation algorithms have beeninvestigated. As the size of real-world DAG data sets often exceeds available main memory;storage in external memory becomes necessary. Hence; there is a practical need for an …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,19
Data mapping as search,George HL Fletcher; Catharine M Wyss,Abstract In this paper; we describe and situate the tupelo system for data mapping inrelational databases. Automating the discovery of mappings between structured datasources is a long standing and important problem in data management. Starting from userprovided example instances of the source and target schemas; tupelo approaches mappingdiscovery as search within the transformation space of these instances based on a set ofmapping operators. tupelo mapping expressions incorporate not only data-metadatatransformations; but also simple and complex semantic transformations; resulting insignificantly wider applicability than previous systems. Extensive empirical validation oftupelo; both on synthetic and real world datasets; indicates that the approach is both viableand effective.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,19
Bridging sql and nosql,John Roijackers; G Fletcher,Abstract A recent trend towards the use of non-relational NoSQL databases raises thequestion where to store application data when part of it is perfectly relational. Dividing dataover separate SQL and NoSQL databases implies manual work to manage multiple datasources. We bridge this gap between SQL and NoSQL via an abstraction layer over bothdatabases that behaves as a single database. We transform the NoSQL data to a tripleformat and incorporate these triples in the SQL database as a virtual relation. Via a series ofself joins the original NoSQL data can be reconstructed from this triple relation. To avoid thetedious task of writing the self joins manually for each query; we develop an extension toSQL that includes a NoSQL query pattern in the query. This pattern describes conditions onthe NoSQL data and lets the rest of the SQL query refer to the corresponding NoSQL data …,Master's thesis; Eindhoven University of Technology,2012,18
External memory k-bisimulation reduction of big graphs,Yongming Luo; George HL Fletcher; Jan Hidders; Yuqing Wu; Paul De Bra,Abstract In this paper; we present; to our knowledge; the first known I/O efficient solutions forcomputing the k-bisimulation partition of a massive directed graph; and performingmaintenance of such a partition upon updates to the underlying graph. Ubiquitous in thetheory and application of graph data; bisimulation is a robust notion of node equivalencewhich intuitively groups together nodes in a graph which share fundamental structuralfeatures. k-bisimulation is the standard variant of bisimulation where the topological featuresof nodes are only considered within a local neighborhood of radius k> 0. The I/O cost of ourpartition construction algorithm is bounded by O (k· sort}(| E t|)+ k· scan (| N t|)+ sort (| N t|));while our maintenance algorithms are bounded by O (k· sort}(| E t|)+ k· scan (| N t|). Thespace complexity bounds are O (| N t|+| E t|) $ and O (k·| N t|+ k·| E t|); resp.

On bridging relational and document-centric data stores,John Roijackers; George HL Fletcher,Abstract Big Data scenarios often involve massive collections of nested data objects;typically referred to as “documents.” The challenges of document management at web scalehave stimulated a recent trend towards the development of document-centric “NoSQL” datastores. Many query tasks naturally involve reasoning over data residing across NoSQL andrelational “SQL” databases. Having data divided over separate stores currently implies labor-intensive manual work for data consumers. In this paper; we propose a general framework toseamlessly bridge the gap between SQL and NoSQL. In our framework; documents arelogically incorporated in the relational store; and querying is performed via a novel NoSQLquery pattern extension to the SQL language. These patterns allow the user to describeconditions on the document-centric data; while the rest of the SQL query refers to the …,British National Conference on Databases,2013,15
Bisimulation reduction of big graphs on mapreduce,Yongming Luo; Yannick de Lange; George HL Fletcher; Paul De Bra; Jan Hidders; Yuqing Wu,Abstract Computing the bisimulation partition of a graph is a fundamental problem whichplays a key role in a wide range of basic applications. Intuitively; two nodes in a graph arebisimilar if they share basic structural properties such as labeling and neighborhoodtopology. In data management; reducing a graph under bisimulation equivalence is a crucialstep; eg; for indexing the graph for efficient query processing. Often; graphs of interest in thereal world are massive; examples include social networks and linked open data. Foranalytics on such graphs; it is becoming increasingly infeasible to rely on in-memory or evenI/O-efficient solutions. Hence; a trend in Big Data analytics is the use of distributedcomputing frameworks such as MapReduce. While there are both internal and externalmemory solutions for efficiently computing bisimulation; there is; to our knowledge; no …,British National Conference on Databases,2013,13
Towards Well-Behaved Schema Evolution.,Rada Chirkova; George HL Fletcher,ABSTRACT We study the problem of schema evolution in the RDF data model. RDF and theRDFS schema language are W3C standards for flexibly modeling and sharing data on theweb. Although schema evolution has been intensively studied in the database andknowledge-representation communities; only recently has progress been made on the studyof RDFS schema evolution. Indeed; the flexible nature of RDF poses novel challenges. Inparticular; since the data model does not strictly distinguish data from metadata; schemaevolution is intimately related to data updates. A major issue encountered during RDFSdatabase updates is a certain type of “nondeterminism” exhibited during schema evolution.In current solutions; such nondeterminism is handled by extralogical rules or heuristics. Is itpossible to characterize the class of RDFS updates which are well-behaved; that is; with a …,WebDB,2009,13
A methodology for coupling fragments of XPath with structural indexes for XML documents,George HL Fletcher; Dirk Van Gucht; Yuqing Wu; Marc Gyssens; Sofía Brenes; Jan Paredaens,Abstract Supporting efficient access to XML data using XPath [3] continues to be animportant research problem [6; 12]. XPath queries are used to specify nodelabeled treeswhich match portions of the hierarchical XML data. In XPath query evaluation; indices similarto those used in relational database systems-namely; value indices on tags and text values-are first used; together with structural join algorithms [1; 2; 19]. This approach turns out to besimple and efficient. However; the structural containment relationships native to XML dataare not directly captured by value indices.,International Symposium on Database Programming Languages,2007,13
Generating flexible workloads for graph databases,Guillaume Bagan; Angela Bonifati; Radu Ciucanu; George HL Fletcher; Aurélien Lemay; Nicky Advokaat,Abstract Graph data management tools are nowadays evolving at a great pace. Key driversof progress in the design and study of data intensive systems are solutions for syntheticgeneration of data and workloads; for use in empirical studies. Current graph generators;however; provide limited or no support for workload generation or are limited to fixed use-cases. Towards addressing these limitations; we demonstrate gMark; the first domain-andquery language-independent framework for synthetic graph and query workload generation.Its novel features are:(i) fine-grained control of graph instance and query workloadgeneration via expressive user-defined schemas;(ii) the support of expressive graph querylanguages; including recursion among other features; and;(iii) selectivity estimation of thegenerated queries. During the demonstration; we will showcase the highly tunable …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,12
Towards a general framework for effective solutions to the data mapping problem,George HL Fletcher; Catharine M Wyss,Abstract Automating the discovery of mappings between structured data sources is a longstanding and important problem in data management. We discuss the rich history of theproblem and the variety of technical solutions advanced in the database community over theprevious four decades. Based on this discussion; we develop a basic statement of the datamapping problem and a general framework for reasoning about the design space of systemsolutions to the problem. We then concretely illustrate the framework with the Tupelo systemfor data mapping discovery; focusing on the important common case of relational datasources. Treating mapping discovery as example-driven search in a space oftransformations; Tupelo generates queries encompassing the full range of structural andsemantic heterogeneities encountered in relational data mapping. Hence; Tupelo is …,*,2009,12
The impact of transitive closure on the expressiveness of navigational query languages on unlabeled graphs,George HL Fletcher; Marc Gyssens; Dirk Leinders; Jan Van den Bussche; Dirk Van Gucht; Stijn Vansummeren; Yuqing Wu,Abstract Several established and novel applications motivate us to study the expressivepower of navigational query languages on graphs; which represent binary relations. Ourbasic language has only the operators union and composition; together with the identityrelation. Richer languages can be obtained by adding other features such as intersection;difference; projection and coprojection; converse; and the diversity relation. The expressivepower of the languages thus obtained cannot only be evaluated at the level of path queries(queries returning binary relations); but also at the level of Boolean or yes/no queries(expressed by the nonemptiness of an expression). For the languages considered above;adding transitive closure augments the expressive power not only at the level of pathqueries but also at the level of Boolean queries; for the latter provided that multiple input …,Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence,2015,11
The impact of transitive closure on the boolean expressiveness of navigational query languages on graphs,George HL Fletcher; Marc Gyssens; Dirk Leinders; Jan Van den Bussche; Dirk Van Gucht; Stijn Vansummeren; Yuqing Wu,Abstract Several established and novel applications motivate us to study the expressivepower of navigational query languages on graphs; which represent binary relations. Ourbasic language has only the operators union and composition; together with the identityrelation. Richer languages can be obtained by adding other features such as other setoperators; projection and coprojection; converse; and the diversity relation. In this paper; weshow that; when evaluated at the level of boolean queries with an unlabeled input graph (ie;a single relation); adding transitive closure to the languages with coprojection addsexpressive power; while this is not the case for the basic language to which none; one; orboth of projection and the diversity relation are added.

Similarity and bisimilarity notions appropriate for characterizing indistinguishability in fragments of the calculus of relations,George HL Fletcher; Marc Gyssens; Dirk Leinders; Jan Van den Bussche; Dirk Van Gucht; Stijn Vansummeren,Motivated by applications in databases; this article considers various fragments of thecalculus of binary relations. The fragments are obtained by leaving out; or keeping in; someof the standard operators; along with some derived operators such as set difference;projection; coprojection and residuation. For each considered fragment; a characterization isobtained for when two given binary relational structures are indistinguishable byexpressions in that fragment. The characterizations are based on appropriately adaptednotions of simulation and bisimulation.,Journal of Logic and Computation,2015,10

Regularities and dynamics in bisimulation reductions of big graphs,Yongming Luo; George HL Fletcher; Jan Hidders; Paul De Bra; Yuqing Wu,Abstract Bisimulation is a basic graph reduction operation; which plays a key role in a widerange of graph analytical applications. While there are many algorithms dedicated tocomputing bisimulation results; to our knowledge; little work has been done to analyze theresults themselves. Since data properties such as skew can greatly influence theperformances of data-intensive tasks; the lack of such insight leads to inefficient algorithmand system design. In this paper we take a close look into various aspects of bisimulationresults on big graphs; from both real-world scenarios and synthetic graph generators; withgraph size varying from 1 million to 1 billion edges. We make the following observations:(1)A certain degree of regularity exists in real-world graphs' bisimulation results. Specifically;power-law distributions appear in many of the results' properties.(2) Synthetic graphs fail …,First International Workshop on Graph Data Management Experiences and Systems,2013,9
Relative expressive power of navigational querying on graphs using transitive closure,Dimitri Surinx; George HL Fletcher; Marc Gyssens; Dirk Leinders; Jan Van den Bussche; Dirk Van Gucht; Stijn Vansummeren; Yuqing Wu,Abstract Motivated by both established and new applications; we study navigational querylanguages for graphs (binary relations).

Efficient regular path query evaluation using path indexes,George HL Fletcher; Jeroen Peters; Alexandra Poulovassilis,We demonstrate the use of localized path indexes in generating efficient execution plans forregular path queries. This study is motivated by both the practicality of this class of queriesand by the current dearth of scalable solutions for their evaluation.

Principles of guarded structural indexing,François Picalausa; George HL Fletcher; Jan Hidders; Stijn Vansummeren,ABSTRACT We present a new structural characterization of the expressive power of theacyclic conjunctive queries in terms of guarded simulations; and give a finite preservationtheorem for the guarded simulation invariant fragment of first order logic. We discuss therelevance of these results as a formal basis for constructing so-called guarded structuralindexes. Structural indexes were first proposed in the context of semistructured querylanguages and later successfully applied as an XML indexation mechanism for XPath-likequeries on trees and graphs. Guarded structural indexes provide a generalization ofstructural indexes from graph databases to relational databases.,stud,2014,7
I/O-efficient algorithms for localized bisimulation partition construction and maintenance on massive graphs,Yongming Luo; George HL Fletcher; Jan Hidders; Yuqing Wu; Paul De Bra,Bisimulation is a robust notion of node equivalence which is ubiquitous in the theory andapplication of graph data. It defines an intuitive notion of nodes in a graph sharingfundamental structural features. In data management; for instance; bisimulation partitioning(ie; grouping together bisimilar nodes) is often a basic step in indexing semi-structureddatasets [6]; and also finds fundamental applications in RDF [7] and general graph data (eg;compression [1; 3]; query processing [4]; data analytics [2]). Inspired by these applications; inthis talk; we consider the problem of computation and maintenance of k-bisimulation; whichis the standard variant of bisimulation where the topological features of nodes are onlyconsidered within a local neighborhood of radius k⩾ 0.,CoRR; abs/1210.0748,2012,7
Enabling identification of online identities between different messaging services,*,A method and system for populating identities in a message service involves registering auser of a first messaging service with a second messaging service. User identities for usersother than the registered user may be identified. These user identities may be associatedwith the first messaging service and may be stored in a list associated with the registereduser. It is determined if each identified user identity has a matching user identity associatedwith the second messaging service. If so; a database associated with the second messagingservice is populated with the matching user identities. Determining whether a matching useridentity exists may be performed; for example; by making character strings comparisonsbetween user identities or using a database that stores a mapping of first messaging serviceuser identities to second messaging service user identities.

Mining exceptional relationships with grammar-guided genetic programming,Jose Maria Luna; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Sebastian Ventura,Abstract Given a database of records; it might be possible to identify small subsets of datawhich distribution is exceptionally different from the distribution in the complete set of datarecords. Finding such interesting relationships; which we call exceptional relationships; inan automated way would allow discovering unusual or exceptional hidden behaviour. In thispaper; we formulate the problem of mining exceptional relationships as a special case ofexceptional model mining and propose a grammar-guided genetic programming algorithm(MERG3P) that enables the discovery of any exceptional relationships. In particular;MERG3P can work directly not only with categorical; but also with numerical data.

Our approach to automating datamap discovery utilizes heuristic search within a space delineated by basic relationaltransformation operators. A novelty of our approach is that these operators include data tometadata transformations (and vice versa). This approach leverages new perspectives onthe data mapping problem; and generalizes previous approaches such as token-based …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,6
Enabling Identification of Online Identities Between Different Messaging Service,*,A method and system for populating identities in a message service involves registering auser of a first messaging service with a second messaging service. User identities for usersother than the registered user may be identified. These user identities may be associatedwith the first messaging service and may be stored in a list associated with the registereduser. It is determined if each identified user identity has a matching user identity associatedwith the second messaging service. If so; a database associated with the second messagingservice is populated with the matching user identities. Determining whether a matching useridentity exists may be performed; for example; by making character strings comparisonsbetween user identities or using a database that stores a mapping of first messaging serviceuser identities to second messaging service user identities. The mapping database may …,*,2013,5
MIQIS: Modular integration of queryable information systems,Catharine M Wyss; George HL Fletcher; Fulya Erdinc; Jeremy T Engle,Abstract Information integration is not a new problem. By all accounts; language has alwaystaken a multitude of forms; thus the need for translating between different representations ofour world has been acute throughout history. With the advent of the World Wide Web;however; this need takes on hitherto unseen dimensions in terms of both difficulty andpromise. Automated; webbased integration could offer unparalleled access to worldwideperspectives; but the range of difference among sources is formidable—even in the case ofa single underlying representational model. The MIQIS project aims to provide a highlevellogic for reasoning about integration scenarios and their fundamental properties. A keycontribution of this perspective is the unification of the semantic; syntactic; and effectiveaspects of information integration. Within MIQIS we research foundational properties of …,Proc.

Systems and methods for facilitating the sharing of digital bundles of services between users,*,Systems and methods are disclosed for allowing a primary user to share a digital service; ina bundle of services implemented by a plurality of different service providers; with asecondary user. In accordance with one implementation; a method includes receiving arequest from the primary user to share a first service in the bundle of services with thesecondary user. The method also includes generating; using at least one processor; a firsttoken that associates the secondary user with the first service. The method further includessending the first token to one of the plurality of different service providers for the first service.Additionally; the method includes modifying a status of the primary user to restrict access tothe first service by the primary user while the first service is being shared with the secondaryuser.,*,2017,4
Regular path query evaluation using path indexes,Jeroen Peters; GHL Fletcher; A Poulovassilis; PME De Bra; O Türetken,Abstract Graph structured data has lately become a bigger part of our lives. Not only in socialnetwork structures; but in many other areas we also see the rise of graph structured data.With the upcoming of this type of data; come different techniques and problems in order touse and analyse the data. One of those problems is the regular path query (RPQ). Here;regular expressions over edge labels are used in order to define a path; for which the begin-and endnode need to be found. Though various different approaches exist for RPQevaluation; path indexes have never been used before. Path indexes store all the paths (upto length k). With path indexes; paths are pre-computed; increasing RPQ evaluation speed.,*,2015,4
Efficient and scalable trie-based algorithms for computing set containment relations,Yongming Luo; George HL Fletcher; Jan Hidders; Paul De Bra,Computing containment relations between massive collections of sets is a fundamentaloperation in data management; for example in graph analytics and data mining applications.Motivated by recent hardware trends; in this paper we present two novel solutions forcomputing set-containment joins over massive sets: the Patricia Trie-based Signature Join(PTSJ) and PRETTI+; a Patricia trie enhanced extension of the state-of-the-art PRETTI join.The compact trie structure not only enables efficient use of main-memory; but alsosignificantly boosts the performance of both approaches. By carefully analyzing thealgorithms and conducting extensive experiments with various synthetic and real-worlddatasets; we show that; in many practical cases; our algorithms are an order of magnitudefaster than the state-of-the-art.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,4
Efficient RDFS entailment in external memory,Wouter J Haffmans; George HL Fletcher,Abstract The entailment of an RDF graph under the RDF Schema standard can easilybecome too costly to compute and maintain. It is often more desirable to compute on-demand whether a triple exists in the entailment. This is a non-trivial task likely to incur I/Ocosts; since RDF graphs are often too large to fit in internal memory. As disk I/O is expensivein terms of time; I/O costs should be minimized to achieve better performance. Weinvestigate three physical indexing methods for RDF storage on disk; comparing them usingthe state of the art RDF Schema entailment algorithm of Muñoz et al. In particular; the I/Obehavior during entailment checking over these graph representations is studied. Extensiveempirical analysis shows that an enhanced version of the state of the art indexing method;which we propose here; yields in general the best I/O performance.,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2011,4
On guarded simulations and acyclic first-order languages.,George HL Fletcher; Jan Hidders; Stijn Vansummeren; Yongming Luo; François Picalausa; Paul De Bra,ABSTRACT An exact structural characterization of the expressive power of the acyclicconjunctive queries is given in terms of guarded simulations. The study of this fragment offirst order logic is motivated by the central role it plays in query languages across a widerange of data models. The study of a structural characterization of the language is motivatedby the applications of such characterizations; for example; in the design of efficient indexingand query processing strategies. In addition to a presentation of our main result; we discussthe results of a small empirical study which indicate the practicality of guarded simulationbased reductions of database instances.,DBPL,2011,4
A role-free approach to indexing large RDF data sets in secondary memory for efficient SPARQL evaluation,George HL Fletcher; Peter W Beck,Abstract: Massive RDF data sets are becoming commonplace. RDF data is typicallygenerated in social semantic domains (such as personal information management) whereina fixed schema is often not available a priori. We propose a simple Three-way Triple Tree(TripleT) secondary-memory indexing technique to facilitate efficient SPARQL queryevaluation on such data sets. The novelty of TripleT is that (1) the index is built over theatoms occurring in the data set; rather than at a coarser granularity; such as whole triplesoccurring in the data set; and (2) the atoms are indexed regardless of the roles (ie; subjects;predicates; or objects) they play in the triples of the data set. We show through extensiveempirical evaluation that TripleT exhibits multiple orders of magnitude improvement over thestate of the art on RDF indexing; in terms of both storage and query processing costs.,arXiv preprint arXiv:0811.1083,2008,4
Structural characterizations of the navigational expressiveness of relation algebras on a tree,George HL Fletcher; Marc Gyssens; Jan Paredaens; Dirk Van Gucht; Yuqing Wu,Abstract We study the expressiveness on a given document of various fragments of XPath;the core navigational language on XML documents. Viewing these languages as fragmentsof Tarski's relation algebra; we give characterizations for when a binary relation on thedocument's nodes (ie; a set of paths) is definable by an expression in these algebras. Incontrast with this “global view” on language semantics; there is also a “local view” whereone is interested in the nodes to which one can navigate starting from a particular node. Inthis view; we characterize when a set of nodes can be defined as the result of applying anexpression to a given node. All of these global and local definability results are obtainedusing a two-step methodology; which consists of first characterizing when two nodes cannotbe distinguished by an expression in the language; and then bootstrapping these …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2016,3
Controlling diversity in benchmarking graph databases,Guillaume Bagan; Angela Bonifati; Radu Ciucanu; George HL Fletcher; Aurélien Lemay; Nicky Advokaat,ABSTRACT Massive graph data sets are pervasive in contemporary application domains.Hence; graph database systems are becoming increasingly important. In the study of thesesystems; it is vital that the research community has shared benchmarking solutions for thegeneration of database instances and query workloads having predictable and controllableproperties. Similarly to TPC benchmarks for relational databases; benchmarks for graphdatabases have been important drivers for the Semantic Web and graph data managementcommunities. Current benchmarks; however; are either limited to fixed graphs or graphschemas; or provide limited or no support for generating tailored query workloads toaccompany graph instances. To move the community forward; a benchmarking approachwhich overcomes these limitations is crucial. In this paper; we present the design and …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.08386,2015,3
Relative expressive power of downward fragments of navigational query languages on trees and chains,Jelle Hellings; Marc Gyssens; Yuqing Wu; Dirk Van Gucht; Jan Van den Bussche; Stijn Vansummeren; George HL Fletcher,Abstract Motivated by the continuing interest in the tree data model; we study the expressivepower of downward fragments of navigational query languages on trees. The basicnavigational query language we consider expresses queries by building binary relationsfrom the edge relations and the identity relation; using composition and union. We study theeffects on the expressive power when we add transitive closure; projections; coprojections;intersection; and difference. We study expressiveness at the level of boolean queries andpath queries; on labeled and unlabeled trees; and on labeled and unlabeled chains. In allthese cases; we are able to present the complete Hasse diagram of relative expressiveness.In particular; we were able to decide; for each fragment of the navigational query languagesthat we study; whether it is closed under difference and intersection when applied on …,Proceedings of the 15th Symposium on Database Programming Languages,2015,3
An Extensible Framework for Query Optimization on TripleT-based RDF Stores.,Bart GJ Wolff; George HL Fletcher; James J Lu,ABSTRACT The RDF data model is a key technology in the Linked Data vision. Given itsgraph structure; even relatively simple RDF queries often involve a large number of joins.Join evaluation poses a significant performance challenge on all state-of-the-art RDFengines. TripleT is a novel RDF index data structure; demonstrated to be competitive withthe current state-of-the-art for join processing. Query optimization on TripleT; however; hasnot been systematically studied up to this point. In this paper we investigate how the use of(i) heuristics and (ii) data statistics can contribute towards a more intelligent way ofgenerating query plans over TripleT-based RDF stores. We propose a generic framework forquery optimization; and show through an extensive empirical study that our frameworkconsistently produces efficient query evaluation plans.,EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2015,3

Constraint processing in relational database systems: From theory to implementation,James J Lu; Sebastien Siva; Ojas Parekh; George HL Fletcher; Hantao Zhang,Abstract Constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) are frequently solved over data residing inrelational database systems. In such scenarios; the database is typically just used as a datastorage back end. However; there exist important advantages; such as the wide availabilityof database practices and tools for modeling; to having database systems that are capableof natively modeling and solving CSPs. This paper introduces general concepts andtechniques to extend a database system with constraint processing capabilities. Input CSPsare modeled via SQL; augmented with a non-deterministic guess operator as introduced byCadoli and Mancini (TPLP 2007). Problems are represented with a combination of internalrelations and parse trees; and are translated to a flexible intermediate problemrepresentation that is subsequently translated into several common representations for …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2010,3
On the data mapping problem,George HL Fletcher,Abstract The emerging networked world promises new possibilities for information sharingand collaboration between autonomous data sources. Facilitating technologies; however;have not successfully addressed the most difficult forms of data heterogeneity which arise inthese collaborations; such as differences in the structuring of data and semantic pluralism inthe interpretation of data. At the heart of overcoming data heterogeneity is the data mappingproblem: automating the discovery of effective mappings between autonomous structureddata sources. The data mapping problem is one of the longest standing issues in datamanagement. Fully automating the discovery of mappings is generally recognized as an" AI-complete" problem in the sense that it is as hard as the hardest problems of ArtificialIntelligence. Consequently; data mapping solutions have typically focused on discovering …,*,2007,3
Declarative Graph Querying in Practice and Theory.,George HL Fletcher; Hannes Voigt; Nikolay Yakovets,ABSTRACT With the recent resurgence of interest in graph data management; there hasbeen a flurry of research on the design and engineering of graph query languages. On thedesign side; there is a large body of theoretical results that have been obtained regardinggraph languages. On the engineering side; many sophisticated scalable solutions for graphquery processing have been developed and put into practice. While both areas are focusingon the study of graph query languages; there has been relatively little work bridging theresults on both sides. This tutorial will survey the state of the art in this landscape with aparticular focus on uncovering and highlighting indicative research issues that are ripe forcollaboration and cross-fertilization between the engineering and theoretical studies ofgraph database systems.,EDBT,2017,2
Stability notions in synthetic graph generation: a preliminary study.,Wilco van Leeuwen; Angela Bonifati; George HL Fletcher; Nikolay Yakovets,ABSTRACT With the rise in adoption of massive graph data; it becomes increasinglyimportant to design graph processing algorithms which have predictable behavior as thegraph scales. This work presents an initial study of stability in the context of a schema-drivensynthetic graph generation. Specifically; we study the design of algorithms which generatehigh-quality sequences of graph instances. Some desirable features of these sequencesinclude monotonic containment of graph instances as they grow in size and consistency ofstructural properties across the sequence. Such stability features are important inunderstanding and explaining the scalability of many graph algorithms which havecrossinstance dependencies (eg; solutions for role detection in dynamic networks and graphquery processing).

On structure preserving sampling and approximate partitioning of graphs,Wouter van Heeswijk; George HL Fletcher; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Abstract Massive graphs are becoming increasingly common in a variety of domains such associal networks and web analytics. One approach to overcoming the challenges of size is tosample the graph; and perform analytics on the smaller graph. However; to be useful; thesample must maintain the properties of interest in the original graph. In this paper; weanalyze the quality of five representative sampling algorithms in how well they preservegraph structure; the bisimulation structure of graphs in particular. As part of this study; wealso develop a new scalable algorithm for computing bisimulation partitions of massivegraphs. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of our new algorithm in bothsequential and distributed settings.,Proceedings of the 31st Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2016,2

A framework for query optimization on value-based RDF indexes,BGJ Wolff; GHL Fletcher,Abstract Growth of RDF datasets presents a challenge for the performance of queryevaluation. By its nature even relatively simple RDF queries (eg “find all authors who havewritten at least one crime novel”) often already involve a large number of joins. Joinevaluation poses a significant performance challenge on all current state-of-the-art RDFengines; which often fail to deliver interactive response times when faced with real querieson real-world datasets with hundreds of millions or even billions of triples. The Three-wayTriple Tree (TripleT) is a proposal for a secondary-memory RDF store and a novel value-based; role-free indexing technique. It is a current state-of-the-art for join processing.

In this way; we covera whole spectrum of different levels of “structuredness” of data. At one end of the spectrum;there is data that; although only loosely structured; can still be organized in some way. At theother end; there are data streams that come in at such a fast pace that even storing them isno longer a valid option.

Discovering complex mapping expressions with the TUPELO data mapping system,George HL Fletcher; Catharine M Wyss,Overcoming data heterogeneity is a long standing problem in the database [3] and artificialintelligence [9] research communities. A general framework for data sharing betweenautonomous systems must account for differences in the representation; structure; andinterpretation of data. These differences arise naturally in the development and evolution ofindependently created and maintained systems. Data mapping is at the heart of solutions forbridging this heterogeneity and has a wide variety of manifestations; eg; schema matching[11] and mapping [8] in database systems; ontology alignment on the semantic web [4]; andmodel matching in generic model management [10]. In general; each of these mappingnotions take data structured under a source schema and translate that data into the structureof a target schema. The general Data Mapping Problem is defined as follows:,Proceedings of the first international workshop on Interoperability of heterogeneous information systems,2005,2
Approaches to Parallel Generic Programming in the STL Framework,George Fletcher; Sriram Sankaran,Abstract While tremendous progress has been made in developing parallel algorithms; therehas not been as much success in developing language support for programming theseparallel algorithms. The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) provides an opportunity forextending the concept of generic programming to the parallel realm. This paper discussesthe basic requirements for extending STL to provide support for data-parallelism in C++. Theultimate goal is to implement a parallel library that is built within the existing framework ofSTL and exploits parallelism in existing sequential algorithms and also provides a set ofparallel algorithms.,Unpublished.

Decentralized object location in dynamic peer-to-peer distributed systems,George Fletcher,One of the key requirements for global level scalability of distributed systems isdecentralization of control. At this level; systems with a few points of concentrated control;such as those based on the client/server model; suffer from poor performance and faulttolerance. A system with decentralized control and decision making; however; is more robustin a “real-world” setting where failures and dynamic system membership are common place.Recent developments in peer-to-peer (P2P) systems have attempted to address this keyissue. A P2P distributed system can be viewed as a virtual network overlay on top of anunderlying network (eg; the Internet). In such a system; each node can serve as a clientwhen requesting services; as a server when providing services; and as a router whenpassing along messages within the system.

Landmark Indexing for Evaluation of Label-Constrained Reachability Queries,Lucien DJ Valstar; George HL Fletcher; Yuichi Yoshida,Abstract Consider a directed edge-labeled graph; such as a social network or a citationnetwork. A fundamental query on such data is to determine if there is a path in the graphfrom a given source vertex to a given target vertex; using only edges with labels in arestricted subset of the edge labels in the graph. Such label-constrained reachability (LCR)queries play an important role in graph analytics; for example; as a core fragment of the so-called regular path queries which are supported in practical graph query languages such asthe W3C's SPARQL 1.1; Neo4j's Cypher; and Oracle's PGQL. Current solutions for LCRevaluation; however; do not scale to large graphs which are increasingly common in a broadrange of application domains. In this paper we present the first practical solution for efficientLCR evaluation; leveraging landmark-based indexes for large graphs.

Node classification in dynamic social networks,Yulong Pei; Jianpeng Zhang; George HL Fletcher; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Abstract. Classifying nodes in networks is different from traditional classification tasks sincethe iid assumption does not hold. In a dynamic scenario; nodes/edges may change duringtime which makes node classification more difficult. There have been a number of studies onnode classification in networks in recent years but one limitation exists: how to make use ofthe temporal information. In this paper; we propose the dynamic Factor Graph Model(dFGM); which is an extension of Factor Graph Models; for the problem of node classificationin dynamic social networks. dFGM can capture not only node attributes and correlations butalso the temporal information for node classification. We conduct experiments on a real-world data set and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposedmethod.,Proceedings of AALTD 2016: Second ECML/PKDD International Workshop on Advanced Analytics and Learning on Temporal Data,2016,1

Structural measures of clustering quality on graph samples,Jianpeng Zhang; Yulong Pei; George HL Fletcher; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Due to the growing presence of large-scale and streaming graphs such as social networks;graph sampling and clustering play an important role in many real-world applications. Onekey aspect of graph clustering is the evaluation of cluster quality. However; little attentionhas been paid to evaluation measures for clustering quality on samples of graphs. As firststeps towards appropriate evaluation of clustering methods on sampled graphs; in this workwe present two novel evaluation measures for graph clustering called δ-precision and δ-recall. These measures effectively reflect the match quality of the clusters in the sampledgraph with respect to the ground-truth clusters in the original graph. We show in extensiveexperiments on various benchmarks that our proposed metrics are practical and effective forgraph clustering evaluation.,Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM); 2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on,2016,1

Empirical evaluation of guarded structural indexing.,Erik Agterdenbos; George HL Fletcher; Chee-Yong Chan; Stijn Vansummeren,ABSTRACT Traditional indices in relational databases are designed for queries that areselective by value. However; queries can also retrieve records on their relational structure. Inour research; we found that traditional indices are ineffective for structurally selectivequeries. To accelerate such queries; socalled 'structural indices' have been applied in graphdatabases. These indices group together structurally similar nodes to obtain a compactrepresentation of the graph structure. We studied how structural indices can be applied inrelational databases and evaluated their performance. Guarded bisimulation groupstogether relational tuples with similar structure; which we use to obtain a guarded structuralindex. Our solution requires significantly less space than traditional indices. At the sametime; it can offer several orders of magnitude faster query evaluation performance.,EDBT,2016,1

Incontrast with the large amount of data being stored in databases; the retrieved information isoften small and may be derived from a fraction of the data. Retrieving valuable informationfrom a large collection of data can be like 'finding the needle in a haystack'. Indexingtechniques enable fast random access to the desired information. Data can directly belocated by ordering or hashing records on their attributes. However; sometimes we want toretrieve records based on their relational structure. Structural indexing has been used in thepast for accelerating graph databases and RDF-databases to solve this problem and it mayalso be suitable for relational databases.,*,2015,1
On reflection in linked data management,George HL Fletcher,The Linked Data (LD) initiative promotes the use of international standards for data sharingon the web. The flexible Resource Description Framework (RDF) graph data model is acentral LD technology. Much of RDF's flexibility is due to its blurring of the traditionaldistinction between data and metadata. A particularly powerful form of metadata is queryexpressions. A query language is called reflective if it can interpret expressions of thelanguage stored as data both as “active” data and as regular “static” data. Fundamentalapplications of reflection are found in diverse domains such as security; informationintegration; and data quality. Consequently; a variety of RDF representations of active datahave been proposed. However; RDF query languages; while bridging the data-metadatabarrier; continue to maintain a divide between active and static data. Hence; applications …,Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,1
MapReduce based algorithms for localized bisimulation,Y de Lange; BF van Dongen; GHL Fletcher,Abstract Intuitively; two nodes in a graph are bisimilar if they share basic structural propertiessuch as labelling and neighbourhood topology. The node set of a graph can be partitionedbased on this equivalence relation. Computing the bisimulation partition of a graph is afundamental problem which can play a key role in a wide range of applications; includingimproving performance of XML or RDF indexing; graph compression; query processing anddata analytics. Moreover; graphs which are of interest typically are massive and can containbillions of nodes and edges such as social networks or linked open data. So in order toanalyse this data; in-memory solutions are infeasible and even I/O-efficient solutions do notscale well with these massive graphs. Hence; we look for parallel or distributed solutions toprocess these big graphs. In this thesis we present; to our knowledge; the first efficient …,Master's thesis; Eindhoven University of Technology,2013,1
Containment queries on nested sets,A Ibrahim; GHL Fletcher,Abstract In this thesis we study the problem of containment queries on nested sets of atomicobjects. A nested set is a set that contains non-trivial sets as elements; as opposed to a flatset; a set that only contains atomic elements. In general; given two sets of nested sets R andS; the containment join of R in S is defined as:,*,2012,1
An XPath Algebraic Characterization of A (k) and P (k) Indices with Applications to Query Processing,George HL Fletcher; Dirk Van Gucht; Yuqing Wu; Marc Gyssens; Jan Paredaens,Abstract Recent studies have proposed structural summary techniques for path queryevaluation on semi-structured data sources. One major line of this research has been theintroduction of the DataGuide; 1-index; 2-index; and A (k) indices; and subsequentinvestigations and generalizations. Another recent study has considered structuralcharacterizations of fragments of XPath; the standard path navigation language for XMLdocuments. In this paper we provide a new perspective on XPath query processing whichbrings together these two areas of research on structural indices and query languages. Inparticular; we give a precise characterization of the A (k) and P (k) indices in terms of certainalgebraic fragments of XPath. With an eye towards applying this result to XPath queryprocessing; we (1) show how expressions in these fragments can be evaluated directly …,*,2006,1
Comparing Downward Fragments of the Relational Calculus with Transitive Closure on Trees,Jelle Hellings; Marc Gyssens; Yuqing Wu; Dirk Van Gucht; Jan Van den Bussche; Stijn Vansummeren; George HL Fletcher,Abstract: Motivated by the continuing interest in the tree data model; we study the expressivepower of downward navigational query languages on trees and chains. Basic navigationalqueries are built from the identity relation and edge relations using composition and union.We study the effects on relative expressiveness when we add transitive closure; projections;coprojections; intersection; and difference; this for boolean queries and path queries onlabeled and unlabeled structures. In all cases; we present the complete Hasse diagram. Inparticular; we establish; for each query language fragment that we study on trees; whether itis closed under difference and intersection.

G-CORE: A Core for Future Graph Query Languages,Renzo Angles; Marcelo Arenas; George HL Fletcher; Claudio Gutierrez; Tobias Lindaaker; Marcus Paradies; Stefan Plantikow; Juan Sequeda; Oskar van Rest; Hannes Voigt,Abstract: We report on a community effort between industry and academia to shape thefuture of graph query languages. We argue that existing graph database managementsystems should consider supporting a query language with two key characteristics. First; itshould be composable; meaning; that graphs are the input and the output of queries.Second; the graph query language should treat paths as first-class citizens. Our result is G-CORE; a powerful graph query language design that fulfills these goals; and strikes a carefulbalance between path query expressivity and evaluation complexity. Subjects: Databases(cs.

Clustering-structure representative sampling from graph streams,Jianpeng Zhang; Kaijie Zhu; Yulong Pei; George Fletcher; Mykola Pechenizkiy,Abstract Most existing sampling algorithms on graphs (ie; network-structured data) focus onsampling from memory-resident static graphs and assume the entire graphs are alwaysavailable. However; the graphs encountered in modern applications are often too largeand/or too dynamic to be processed with limited memory. Furthermore; existing samplingtechniques are inadequate for preserving the inherent clustering structure; which is anessential property of complex networks. To tackle these problems; we propose a newsampling algorithm that dynamically maintains a representative sample and is capable ofretaining clustering structure in graph streams at any time. Performance of the proposedalgorithm is evaluated through empirical experiments using real-world networks. Theexperimental results have shown that our proposed CPIES algorithm can produce …,International Workshop on Complex Networks and their Applications,2017,*

Landmark indexing for scalable evaluation of label-constrained reachability queries,Lucien Valstar; George Fletcher; Yuichi Yoshida,Abstract Our world today is generating huge amounts of graph data such as social networks;biological networks; and the semantic web. Many of these real-world graphs are edge-labelled graphs; ie each edge has a label that denotes the relationship between the twovertices connected by the edge. A fundamental research problem on these is how to handlereachability in these kinds of graphs: can vertex u reach vertex v using only edges withparticular labels? There has not been very much research on this topic yet. Hence we havecome up with our own solution based on an index. We dealt with the problem by looking forseveral algorithms that can deal with these queries. We ran several experiments to examinetheir performance relative to a baseline algorithm. The results show that there is a clearperformance improvement by building the index we develop here.,*,2016,*
Efficient regular path query evaluation in PGX,Xuming Meng,Nowadays; available data on the Internet grows extremely rapidly in terms of volume;velocity and variety. Efficient management of such huge amount of data has appealed toboth industry and academia. However; the data model used by traditional relationaldatabase management system does not fit in all user cases; such as semantic web [7]; socialnetwork [5; 49; 42]; biological network [39; 40]. The relational model [43] represents data astuples; groups them into relations. Each relation has unique primary/-foreign key used toindicate hidden data connections. The major drawback of this model is expensive discoveryof data connection via join operation. Usually; queries involving many link discovery tend tobe processed inefficiently. Another downside of relational data model is lack of explicitrepresentation of connection between data items; resulting in limits on expressiveness of …,*,2016,*
Structural measures of clustering quality on graph samples,GHL Fletcher; J Zhang; Y Pei; M Pechenizkiy,Abstract Due to the growing presence of large-scale and streaming graphs such as socialnetworks; graph sampling and clustering play an important role in many real-worldapplications. One key aspect of graph clustering is the evaluation of cluster quality.However; little attention has been paid to evaluation measures for clustering quality onsamples of graphs. As first steps towards appropriate evaluation of clustering methods onsampled graphs; in this work we present two novel evaluation measures for graph clusteringcalled δ-precision and δ-recall. These measures effectively reflect the match quality of theclusters in the sampled graph with respect to the ground-truth clusters in the original graph.We show in extensive experiments on various benchmarks that our proposed metrics arepractical and effective for graph clustering evaluation.< br/>,*,2016,*

Identifying regrettable messages on social networks,SPG Patelski; Mykola Pechenizkiy; Aristides Gionis; George Fletcher; Dragan Bosnacki,Abstract The things you post on the internet can stay there for years; or maybe even forever.People often forget that their posts on online social networks can be read by more peoplethan they think. Even things that are posted privately to a group of friends may leak to alarger audience when the post is spread further by one of the friends. According to onestudy; 41% of Twitter users regret placing certain tweets. When such a tweet is posted; only11% realizes immediately after posting that it was a mistake. This may cause harm to theircareers or relationships. Therefore it is reasonable to say that social network users coulduse a little help with determining what to show on the social network. Our study makes a firststep towards finding a methodology that enables users to detect regrettable messages onsocial networks.

Object recognition framework using information retrieval and machine learning techniques,R Moonen; M Moonen; GHL Fletcher,Abstract This thesis describes the creation of a framework for object recognition based oninformation retrieval and machine learning techniques. The framework can process anannotated dataset of images to produce a classifier that can predict the presence or absenceof an object in a new image. This classifier can be used as an extension in otherapplications. The framework is not fixed to any domain logic; making it a reusable tool tolearn different objects in different domains for different applications. The framework canhandle class hierarchies making it possible to create classifiers for different levels of abstractor detailed classes of objects. Local features where used for the processing of images intocollections of individually comparable points of reference. Several algorithms are discussedthat can produce these local features.

Bisimulation partitioning and partition maintenance,Jelle Hellings,ABSTRACT The combination of graphs and node bisimulation is widely used within andoutside of computer science. One example of this combination is constructing indices forspeeding up queries on XML documents. Thereby XML documents can be represented bytrees and many index types for indexing XML documents utilize the notion of bisimulation.Thereby the notion of bisimulation is used to relate nodes that have equivalent behavior withrespect to queries performed on the XML documents. By replacing these bisimilar nodesone can reduce the size of the XML document and as such speed up queries.

Coupling fragments of XPath with XML indexing and query decomposition,George HL Fletcher; Dirk Van Gucht; Yuqing Wu; Marc Gyssens; Jan Paredaens,Recent studies have proposed structural summary techniques for pathquery evaluation onsemi-structured data sources. One major line of this research has been the introduction ofthe DataGuide; 1-index; 2-index; and A (k) indices; and subsequent investigations andgeneralizations. Another recent study has considered structural characterizations offragments of XPath; the standard path navigation language for XML documents. In this paperwe provide a methodology on XPath query processing that couples these two areas ofresearch on structural indices and query languages. To illustrate this methodology; we applyit to couple an upward-only XPath fragment with the A (k) and P (k) structural indices. Withan eye towards applying this result to XPath query processing; we (1) show how upward-only XPath expressions can be evaluated directly on the corresponding indices and (2) …,*,2007,*

preliminary study,WJ van Leeuwen; GHL Fletcher; N Yakovets; A Bonifati,ABSTRACT With the rise in adoption of massive graph data; it becomes increasinglyimportant to design graph processing algorithms which have predictable behavior as thegraph scales. This work presents an initial study of stability in the context of a schema-drivensynthetic graph generation. Specifically; we study the design of algorithms which generatehigh-quality sequences of graph instances. Some desirable features of these sequencesinclude monotonic containment of graph instances as they grow in size and consistency ofstructural properties across the sequence. Such stability features are important inunderstanding and explaining the scalability of many graph algorithms which havecrossinstance dependencies (eg; solutions for role detection in dynamic networks and graphquery processing). We implement a preliminary approach in the recently proposed …,*,*,*
Indexing Triples with SAINT DB,Yongming Luo; François Picalausa; George HL Fletcher; Jan Hidders; Stijn Vansummeren; Paul De Bra,In this talk; we introduce a native RDF database system that we have been developing latelycalled SAINT DB. Resource Description Framework (RDF) is becoming the de factostandard data model for publishing and exchanging information on the web. As an essentialpart of the W3C's semantic web stack and linked data initiative; RDF data managementsystems (also known as triplestores) have drawn a lot of attention from the databaseresearch community. Various systems have been developed; accompanied by a growingliterature. The majority of these systems use value-based indexes (eg; B-Tree) as theirstorage back ends; without considering many of the structural aspects of RDF datasets.Structural indexes have been successfully applied in XML data management. In theseapproaches; nodes in a graph are indexed based on some equivalence criteria; for …,*,*,*
gMark: Controlling Workload Diversity in Benchmarking Graph Databases,Guillaume Bagan; Angela Bonifati; Radu Ciucanu; George HL Fletcher; Aurélien Lemay; Nicky Advokaat,Abstract—Massive graph data sets are pervasive in contemporary application domains.Hence; graph database systems are becoming increasingly important. In the study of thesesystems; it is vital that the research community has shared benchmarking solutions for thegeneration of database instances and query workloads having predictable and controllableproperties. Similarly to TPC benchmarks for relational databases; benchmarks for graphdatabases have been important drivers for the Semantic Web and graph data managementcommunities. In this paper; we present the design and engineering principles of gMark; adomain-and query language-independent graph benchmark exhibiting flexible schema andworkload chokepoints. A core contribution of gMark is its ability to target and control thediversity of properties of both the generated graph instances and the generated query …,*,*,*
Iterative Preprocessing of Event Logs,BF van Dongen; JCAM Buijs; GHL Fletcher,Abstract Information systems; nowadays; play a large role within organizations in supportingbusiness processes. Typically; all events that are handled by the system are recorded.These records of activities handled by the information system are called event logs. Ideally;an event log contains all events that have occurred; although this is not guaranteed to be thecase. In the area of process mining; we investigate these event logs. There is a certainamount of data available in an event log; such as event name; resource and date and time ofexecution. We then use algorithms to mine all kinds of information; such as process models;social networks and performance data. However; for these algorithms to function asexpected; they need to make certain assumptions. Preprocessing is used to prepare theevent log for the conditions specified by the analysis algorithm. Furthermore; different …,*,*,*

Towards a valid object model,MGJ van den Brand; I Barosan; FAI Peeters; GHL Fletcher; D Joosten,Abstract The system development life cycle (SDLC) encounters several issues such aschanging requirements. Changes in the requirements are inevitable and are caused byinternal factors; which may be under the control of the project team or external factors; whichare outside the control of the project team. A change in the requirements propagatesthroughout the phases; and requires that the activities in each phase must be executed onceagain. This produces new deliverables. If the system development life cycle has a limitedbudget and time frame; certain activities may be neglected. Neglecting certain activities maydecrease the quality of the software system. Therefore; a new method must be defined thatwill allow the activities to be executed in a manner that ensures and maintains the quality ofthe software system. We propose the 'Towards a valid object model'method; which …,*,*,*

On Teaching Computational Thinking,James J Lu; George HL Fletcher,ABSTRACT Jeannette Wing's call for teaching Computational Thinking (CT) as a formativeskill on par with reading; writing; and arithmetic places computer science in the category ofbasic knowledge. Just as proficiency in basic language arts helps us to effectivelycommunicate and in basic math helps us to successfully quantitate; proficiency incomputational thinking helps us to systematically and efficiently process information andtasks. But while teaching everyone to think computationally is a noble goal; there arepedagogical challenges. Perhaps the most confounding issue is the role of programming;and whether we can separate it from teaching basic computer science. How muchprogramming; if any; should be required for CT proficiency? We believe that to successfullybroaden participation in computer science; efforts must be made to lay the foundations of …,*,*,*
