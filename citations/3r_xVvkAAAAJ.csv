Locating objects in mobile computing,Evaggelia Pitoura; George Samaras,In current distributed systems; the notion of mobility is emerging in many forms andapplications. Mobility arises naturally in wireless computing since the location of userschanges as they move. Besides mobility in wireless computing; software mobile agents areanother popular form of moving objects. Locating objects; ie; identifying their currentlocation; is central to mobile computing. We present a comprehensive survey of the variousapproaches to the problem of storing; querying; and updating the location of objects inmobile computing. The fundamental techniques underlying the proposed approaches areidentified; analyzed; and classified along various dimensions.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2001,361
Business models and transactions in mobile electronic commerce: requirements and properties,Aphrodite Tsalgatidou; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Advances in wireless network technology and the continuously increasing numberof users of hand-held terminals make the latter a possible channel for offering personalizedservices to mobile users and give pace to the rapid development of mobile electroniccommerce (MEC). MEC operates partially in a different environment than Internet e-commerce due to the special characteristics and constraints of mobile terminals andwireless networks and the context; situations and circumstances in which people use theirhand-held terminals. In this paper; we discuss the business models in MEC and transactionmodeling issues pertinent for the business models and the environment.,Computer Networks,2001,302
Maintaining consistency of data in mobile distributed environments,Evaggelia Pitoura; Bharat Bhargava,To deal with the frequent; foreseeable and variable disconnections that occur in a mobileenvironment; we introduce a flexible; two-level consistency model. Semantically related orclosely located data are grouped together to form a cluster. While all data inside a clusterare mutually consistent; degrees of inconsistency are allowed among data at differentclusters. To take advantage of the predictability of disconnections; and to accommodatemobility; the cluster configuration is dynamic. We allow transactions to exhibit certaindegrees of tolerance for inconsistencies by introducing strict and weak operations. Weakoperations are operations that can be executed under weaker consistency requirements. Wedefine correctness criteria for schedules that involve weak operations and compare themwith traditional serializability criteria. Finally; we argue that our model is appropriate for a …,Distributed Computing Systems; 1995.; Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on,1995,276
Object orientation in multidatabase systems,Evaggelia Pitoura; Omran Bukhres; Ahmed Elmagarmid,Abstract A multidatabase system (MDBS) is a confederation of preexisting distributed;heterogeneous; and autonomous database systems. There has been a recent proliferationof research suggesting the application of object-oriented techniques to facilitate the complextask of designing and implementing MDBSs. Although this approach seems promising; thelack of a general framework impedes any further development. The goal of this paper is toprovide a concrete analysis and categorization of the various ways in which objectorientation has affected the task of designing and implementing MDBSs. We identify threedimensions in which the object-oriented paradigm has influenced this task: the generalsystem architecture; the schema architecture; and the heterogeneous transactionmanagement. Then we provide a classification and a comprehensive analysis of the …,ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR),1995,216
Content-based routing of path queries in peer-to-peer systems,Georgia Koloniari; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems are gaining increasing popularity as a scalable meansto share data among a large number of autonomous nodes. In this paper; we consider thecase in which the nodes in a P2P system store XML documents. We propose a fullydecentralized approach to the problem of routing path queries among the nodes of a P2Psystem based on maintaining specialized data structures; called filters that efficientlysummarize the content; ie; the documents; of one or more node. Our proposed filters; calledmulti-level Bloom filters; are based on extending Bloom filters so that they maintaininformation about the structure of the documents. In addition; we advocate building ahierarchical organization of nodes by clustering together nodes with similar content.Similarity between nodes is related to the similarity between the corresponding filters.

Data consistency in intermittently connected distributed systems,Evaggelia Pitoura; Bharat Bhargava,Mobile computing introduces a new form of distributed computation in which communicationis most often intermittent; low-bandwidth; or expensive; thus providing only weakconnectivity. We present a replication scheme tailored for such environments. Boundedinconsistency is defined by allowing controlled deviation among copies located at weaklyconnected sites. A dual database interface is proposed that in addition to read and writeoperations with the usual semantics supports weak read and write operations. In contrast tothe usual read and write operations that read consistent values and perform permanentupdates; weak operations access only local and potentially inconsistent copies and performupdates that are only conditionally committed. Exploiting weak operations supportsdisconnected operation since mobile clients can employ them to continue to operate even …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,1999,165
Peer-to-peer management of XML data: issues and research challenges,Georgia Koloniari; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Peer-to-peer (p2p) systems are attracting increasing attention as an efficient meansof sharing data among large; diverse and dynamic sets of users. The widespread use ofXML as a standard for representing and exchanging data in the Internet suggests using XMLfor describing data shared in a p2p system. However; sharing XML data imposes newchallenges in p2p systems related to supporting advanced querying beyond simple keyword-based retrieval. In this paper; we focus on data management issues for processing XML datain a p2p setting; namely indexing; replication; clustering and query routing and processing.For each of these topics; we present the issues that arise; survey related research andhighlight open research problems.,ACM Sigmod Record,2005,153
A survey on representation; composition and application of preferences in database systems,Kostas Stefanidis; Georgia Koutrika; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Preferences have been traditionally studied in philosophy; psychology; andeconomics and applied to decision making problems. Recently; they have attracted theattention of researchers in other fields; such as databases where they capture soft criteria forqueries. Databases bring a whole fresh perspective to the study of preferences; bothcomputational and representational. From a representational perspective; the centralquestion is how we can effectively represent preferences and incorporate them in databasequerying. From a computational perspective; we can look at how we can efficiently processpreferences in the context of database queries. Several approaches have been proposedbut a systematic study of these works is missing. The purpose of this survey is to provide aframework for placing existing works in perspective and highlight critical open challenges …,ACM Trans. Database Syst,2011,140

Active Data Warehousing refers to a new trend where data warehouses areupdated as frequently as possible; to accommodate the high demands of users for freshdata. In this paper; we propose a framework for the implementation of active datawarehousing; with the following goals:(a) minimal changes in the software configuration ofthe source;(b) minimal overhead for the source due to the active nature of datapropagation;(c) the possibility of smoothly regulating the overall configuration of theenvironment in a principled way.

Weaddress the problem of ensuring the consistency and currency of client read-onlytransactions in the presence of updates. To this end; additional control information isbroadcast. A suite of methods is proposed that vary in the complexity and volume of thecontrol information transmitted and subsequently differ in response times; degrees ofconcurrency; and space and processing overheads. The proposed methods are combinedwith caching to improve query latency. The relative advantages of each method aredemonstrated through both simulation results and qualitative arguments.

Exploiting versions for handling updates in broadcast disks,Evaggelia Pitoura; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract Recently; broadcasting has attracted considerable attention as a means ofdisseminating information to large client populations in both wired and wireless settings. Inthis paper; we exploit versions to increase the concurrency of client transactions in thepresence of updates. We consider three alternative mediums for storing versions:(a) the air:older versions are broadcast along with current data;(b) the client's local cache: olderversions are maintained in cache; and (c) a local database or warehouse at the client: part ofthe server's database is maintained at the client in the form of a multiversion materializedview. The proposed techniques are scalable in that they provide consistency without anydirect communication from clients to the server. Performance results show that the overheadof maintaining versions can be kept low; while providing a considerable increase in …,Proceedings of the International Conference on Very Large Data Bases,1999,111
Adding context to preferences,Kostas Stefanidis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panos Vassiliadis,To handle the overwhelming amount of information currently available; personalizationsystems allow users to specify the information that interests them through preferences. Mostoften; users have different preferences depending on context. In this paper; we introduce amodel for expressing such contextual preferences. Context is modeled as a set ofmultidimensional attributes. We formulate the context resolution problem as the problem of(a) identifying those preferences that qualify to encompass the context state of a query and(b) selecting the most appropriate among them. We also propose an algorithm for contextresolution that uses a data structure; called the profile tree; that indexes preferences basedon their associated context. Finally; we evaluate our approach from two perspectives:usability and performance.,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007. IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,106

Mobile agents for wireless computing: the convergence of wireless computational models with mobile-agent technologies,Constantinos Spyrou; George Samaras; Evaggelia Pitoura; Paraskevas Evripidou,Abstract Wireless mobile computing breaks the stationary barrier and allows users tocompute and access information from anywhere and at anytime. However; this new freedomof movement does not come without new challenges. The mobile computing environment isconstrained in many ways. Mobile elements are resource-poor and unreliable. Their networkconnectivity is often achieved through low-bandwidth wireless links. Furthermore;connectivity is frequently lost for variant periods of time. The difficulties raised by theseconstraints are compounded by mobility that induces variability in the availability of bothcommunication and computational resources. These severe restrictions have a great impacton the design and structure of mobile computing applications and motivate the developmentof new software models. To this end; a number of extensions to the traditional distributed …,Mobile Networks and Applications,2004,94
Disc diversity: result diversification based on dissimilarity and coverage,Marina Drosou; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Recently; result diversification has attracted a lot of attention as a means to improvethe quality of results retrieved by user queries. In this paper; we propose a new; intuitivedefinition of diversity called DisC diversity. A DisC diverse subset of a query result containsobjects such that each object in the result is represented by a similar object in the diversesubset and the objects in the diverse subset are dissimilar to each other. We show thatlocating a minimum DisC diverse subset is an NP-hard problem and provide heuristics for itsapproximation. We also propose adapting DisC diverse subsets to a different degree ofdiversification. We call this operation zooming. We present efficient implementations of ouralgorithms based on the M-tree; a spatial index structure; and experimentally evaluate theirperformance.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,77
Supporting read-only transactions in wireless broadcasting,Evaggelia Pitoura,Wireless communications support a new form of data delivery in which servers broadcastdata to a number of clients that listen to the broadcast channel and retrieve data of interestas they arrive on the channel. We address the problem of ensuring the consistency andcurrency of read-only transactions when the values of broadcast data change. We identify aset of criteria that methods for ensuring consistency in wireless mobile computing mustsatisfy. We then present a number of such methods and evaluate the degree at which theyfulfill the criteria set. Consistency is ensured without contacting the server.,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 1998. Proceedings. Ninth International Workshop on,1998,77
Multiversion data broadcast,Evaggelia Pitoura; Panos K.

In this paper; weconsider broadcasting multiple versions of data items to increase the concurrency of clienttransactions in the presence of updates. We introduce various techniques for organizingmultiple versions on the broadcast channel. Performance results show that the overhead ofsupporting multiple versions can be kept low while providing a considerable increase inconcurrency. Besides increasing the concurrency of client transactions; multiversionbroadcast provides clients with the possibility of accessing multiple server states in a singlebroadcast cycle. Furthermore; multiversioning increases the tolerance of client transactionsof disconnections from the broadcast channel.,Computers; IEEE Transactions on,2002,75

On the performance of flooding-based resource discovery,Vassilios V Dimakopoulos; Evaggelia Pitoura,We consider flooding-based resource discovery in distributed systems. With flooding; a nodesearching for a resource contacts its neighbors in the network; which in turn contact theirown neighbors and so on until a node possessing the requested resource is located.Flooding assumes no knowledge about the network topology or the resource distributionthus offering an attractive means for resource discovery in dynamically evolving networkssuch as peer-to-peer systems. We provide analytical results for the performance of a numberof flooding-based approaches that differ in the set of neighbors contacted at each step. Theperformance metrics we are interested in are the probability of locating a resource and theaverage number of steps and messages for doing so. We study both uniformly randomresource requests and requests in the presence of popular (hot) resources. Our analysis …,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2006,62
CoWSAMI: Interface-aware context gathering in ambient intelligence environments,Dionysis Athanasopoulos; Apostolos V Zarras; Valerie Issarny; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panos Vassiliadis,Abstract In this paper we present CoWSAMI; a middleware infrastructure that enablescontext awareness in open ambient intelligence environments; consisting of mobile usersand context sources that become dynamically available as the users move from one locationto another. A central requirement in such dynamic scenarios is to be able to integrate newcontext sources and users at run-time. CoWSAMI exploits a novel approach towards thisgoal. The proposed approach is based on utilizing Web services as interfaces to contextsources and dynamically updatable relational views for storing; aggregating and interpretingcontext. Context rules are employed to provide mappings that specify how to populatecontext relations; with respect to the different context sources that become dynamicallyavailable.

A framework for providing consistent and recoverable agent-based access to heterogeneous mobile databases,Evaggelia Pitoura; Bharat Bhargava,Abstract Information applications are increasingly required to be distributed amongnumerous remote sites through both wireless and wired links. Traditional models ofdistributed computing are inadequate to overcome the communication barrier this generatesand to support the development of complex applications. In this paper; we advocate anapproach based on agents. Agents are software modules that encapsulate data and code;cooperate to solve complicated tasks; and run at remote sites with minimum interaction withthe user. We define an agent-based framework for accessing mobile heterogeneousdatabases. We then investigate concurrency control and recovery issues and outlinepossible solutions. Agent-based computing advances database transaction and control flowmanagement concepts and remote programming techniques.,ACM Sigmod Record,1995,50
Fast contextual preference scoring of database tuples,Kostas Stefanidis; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract To provide users with only relevant data from the huge amount of availableinformation; personalization systems utilize preferences to allow users to express theirinterest on specific pieces of data. Most often; user preferences vary depending on thecircumstances. For instance; when with friends; users may like to watch thrillers; whereas;when with their kids; they may prefer to watch cartoons. Contextual preference systemsaddress this challenge by supporting preferences that depend on the values of contextualattributes such as the surrounding environment; time or location. In this paper; we addressthe problem of finding interesting data items based on contextual preferences that assigninterest scores to pieces of data based on context. To this end; we propose a number of pre-processing steps. Instead of pre-computing scores for all data items under all potential …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,47
PerK: personalized keyword search in relational databases through preferences,Kostas Stefanidis; Marina Drosou; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Keyword-based search in relational databases allows users to discover relevantinformation without knowing the database schema or using complicated queries. However;such searches may return an overwhelming number of results; often loosely related to theuser intent. In this paper; we propose personalizing keyword database search by utilizinguser preferences. Query results are ranked based on both their relevance to the query andtheir preference degree for the user. To further increase the quality of results; we considertwo new metrics that evaluate the goodness of the result as a set; namely coverage of manyuser interests and content diversity. We present an algorithm for processing preferencequeries that uses the preferential order between keywords to direct the joining of relevanttuples from multiple relations. We then show how to reduce the complexity of this …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,46

An efficient hierarchical scheme for locating highly mobile users,Evaggelia Pitoura; Ioannis Fudos,Abstract To accommodate the increase in user population in future personal communicationsystems; hierarchical architectures of location databases have been proposed. In this paper;a scheme based on forwarding pointers is presented; that re-duces the cost of the overallnetwork and database traffic generated by frequent location updates in such hierarchicalarchitectures. To reduce the number of forwarding pointers that need to be traversed tolocate a user; auxiliary caching techniques are presented. Various conditions for purging thechain of forwarding pointers and updating the database are also introduced. Special care isgiven so that the scheme correctly supports the concurrent execution of updates andlookups. The applicability of the scheme and the performance of the caching techniques aredemonstrated through a number of experiments for a range of call to mobility ratios and …,Proceedings of the seventh international conference on Information and knowledge management,1998,46

Cooperative xpath caching,Kostas Lillis; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Motivated by the fact that XML is increasingly being used in distributed applications;we propose building a cooperative caching scheme for XML documents. Our scheme allowssharing cache content among a number of peers. To facilitate sharing; a distributed prefix-based index is built based on the queries whose results are cached. In the loosely-coupledsharing approach; each peer stores in its local cache results of its own queries and justpublishes the associated queries to the index. In the tightly-coupled approach; each peer isassigned a specific part of the query space and stores in its local cache the results of thecorresponding queries. Both approaches result in a dynamic organization of content thatevolves over time based on the query load; the number of peers and the overall storageavailable.

Typically; in such systems;all subscriptions are considered equally important. However; due to the abundance ofinformation; users may receive overwhelming amounts of events. In this paper; we proposeusing a ranking mechanism based on user preferences; so that only top-ranked events aredelivered to each user. Since many times top-ranked events are similar to each other; wealso propose increasing the diversity of delivered events. Furthermore; we examine anumber of different delivering policies for forwarding ranked events to users; namely aperiodic; a sliding-window and a history-based one.

On using histograms as routing indexes in peer-to-peer systems,Yannis Petrakis; Georgia Koloniari; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Peer-to-peer systems offer an efficient means for sharing data among autonomousnodes. A central issue is locating the nodes with data matching a user query. Adecentralized solution to this problem is based on using routing indexes which are datastructures that describe the content of neighboring nodes. Each node uses its routing indexto route a query towards those of its neighbors that provide the largest number of results. Weconsider using histograms as routing indexes. We describe a decentralized procedure forclustering similar nodes based on histograms. Similarity between nodes is defined based onthe set of queries they match and related with the distance between their histograms. Ourexperimental results show that using histograms to cluster similar nodes and to routequeries increases the number of results returned for a given number of nodes visited.,Databases; Information Systems; and Peer-to-Peer Computing,2005,41

Creating and maintaining replicas in unstructured peer-to-peer systems,Elias Leontiadis; Vassilios Dimakopoulos; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract In peer-to-peer systems; replication is an important issue as it improves searchperformance and data availability. It has been shown that optimal replication is attainedwhen the number of replicas per item is proportional to the square root of their popularity. Inthis paper; we focus on updates in the case of optimal replication. In particular; we propose anew practical strategy for achieving square root replication called pull-then-push replication(PtP). With PtP; after a successful search; the requesting node enters a replicate-push phasewhere it transmits copies of the item to its neighbors. We show that updating the replicas canbe significantly improved through an update-push phase where the node that created thecopies propagates any updates it has received using similar parameters as in replicate-push. Our experimental results show that replicate-push coupled with an update-push …,Euro-Par 2006 Parallel Processing,2006,38

Whereas previous research has mainly considered the static version of theproblem; in this paper; we exploit the dynamic case in which the result set changes overtime; as for example; in the case of notification services. We define the Continuous k-Diversity Problem along with appropriate constraints that enforce continuity requirements onthe diversified results. Our proposed approach is based on cover trees and supportsdynamic item insertion and deletion.

A peer-to-peer approach to resource discovery in multi-agent systems,Vassilios Dimakopoulos; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract A multi-agent system is a network of software agents that cooperate to solveproblems. In open multi-agent systems; the agents that need resources provided by otheragents are not aware of which agents provide the particular resources. We propose a fullydistributed approach to this resource discovery problem. Each agent A maintains a limitedsize local cache in which it keeps information about k different resources; that is; for each ofthe k resources; it stores the contact information of one agent that provides it. The agents inthe cache of agent A are called A's neighbors. An agent searching for a resource contacts itslocal cache and if there is no information for the resource; it contacts its neighbors; which inturn contact their neighbors and so on until the resource is found in some cache. Weconsider variations of this flooding-based search and develop and verify by simulation …,Cooperative Information Agents VII,2003,32
Modeling and storing context-aware preferences,Kostas Stefanidis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panos Vassiliadis,Abstract Today; the overwhelming volume of information that is available to an increasinglywider spectrum of users creates the need for personalization. In this paper; we consider adatabase system that supports context-aware preference queries; that is; preference querieswhose result depends on the context at the time of their submission. We use data cubes tostore the associations between context-dependent preferences and database relations andOLAP techniques for processing context-aware queries; thus allowing the manipulation ofthe captured context data at different levels of abstractions. To improve query performance;we use an auxiliary data structure; called context tree; which indexes the results ofpreviously computed preference-aware queries based on their associated context. We showhow these cached results can be used to process both exact and approximate context …,Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2006,31
Distributed location databases for tracking highly mobile objects,Evaggelia Pitoura; Ioannis Fudos,Abstract In current distributed systems; the notion of mobility is emerging in many forms andapplications. Increasingly many users are not tied to a fixed access point but instead usewireless communications or dial-up services to access data independent of their physicallocation. Furthermore; mobile software; a popular example being mobile agents; isfrequently used as a new form of building distributed network-centric applications. Trackingmobile objects; ie identifying their current location; is central to such settings. In this paper;we exploit the use of hierarchical distributed location databases; where each database sitecovers a specific geographical region and contains location information about all objectsresiding in it. For highly mobile objects; a scheme based on forwarding pointers enhancedwith auxiliary caching techniques is presented; to reduce the cost of the overall network …,The Computer Journal,2001,31

Content-based overlay networks for XML peers based on multi-level bloom filters,Georgia Koloniari; Yannis Petrakis; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Peer-to-peer systems are gaining popularity as a means to effectively share huge;massively distributed data collections. In this paper; we consider XML peers; that is; peersthat store XML documents. We show how an extension of traditional Bloom filters; calledmulti-level Bloom filters; can be used to route path queries in such a system. In addition; wepropose building content-based overlay networks by linking together peers with similarcontent. The similarity of the content (ie; the local documents) of two peers is defined basedon the similarity of their filters. Our experimental results show that overlay networks builtbased on filter similarity are very effective in retrieving a large number of relevantdocuments; since peers with similar content tend to be clustered together.,Databases; Information Systems; and Peer-to-Peer Computing,2004,30
Bloom-based filters for hierarchical data,Georgia Koloniari; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract. In this paper; we present two novel hash-based indexing structures; based onBloom filters; called breadth and depth Bloom filters; which in contrast to traditional hashbased indexes; are able to represent hierarchical data and support path expression queries.We describe how these structures can be used for resource discovery in peer-to-peernetworks. We have implemented both structures and our experiments show that they bothoutperform the traditional Bloom filters in discovering the appropriate resources.,Proc. 5th Workshop on Distributed Data and Structures (WDAS),2003,29
Concept-based discovery of mobile services,Chara Skouteli; George Samaras; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract In this paper; we consider semantic service discovery in a global computingenvironment. We propose creating a dynamic overlay network by grouping togethersemantically related services. Each such group of services is termed a community.Communities are organized in a global taxonomy whose nodes are related contextually. Thetaxonomy can be seen as an expandable distributed semantic index over the systemservices; which aims at improving service discovery. Our performance results indicate that incertain cases; our service discovery mechanism outperforms even the case in which serviceindexes are fully replicated at all system sites.,Proceedings of the 6th international conference on Mobile data management,2005,28
Keep your data safe and available while roaming,Yolanda Villate; Arantza Illarramendi; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract The possibility of accessing and/or receiving local or remote data anywhere and atanytime constitutes an important advantage in many business environments. However;when working with mobile devices; users face many problems; such as:(1) devise exposureproblems–mobile devices are more vulnerable and fragile than stationary devices; becausethey can be easily stolen; lost or damaged;(2) media problems–wireless communicationsare often unstable; asymmetric and expensive; and (3) availability problems–mobile devicesstay disconnected for long periods of time. To alleviate these problems; we present aservice; Data Lockers; which offers to its users first; the possibility of keeping their data in asecure and safe space in a proxy; thus alleviating the device exposure problem. Next; datastored in a data locker are available even when the mobile device is disconnected; thus …,Mobile Networks and Applications,2002,28
Managing contextual preferences,Kostas Stefanidis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panos Vassiliadis,Abstract To handle the overwhelming amount of information currently available;personalization systems allow users to specify through preferences which pieces of datainterest them. Most often; users have different preferences depending on context. In thispaper; we introduce a model for expressing such contextual preferences. Context ismodeled using a set of hierarchical attributes; thus allowing context specification at variouslevels of detail. We formulate the context resolution problem as the problem of selectingappropriate preferences based on context for personalizing a query. We also proposealgorithms for context resolution based on data structures that index preferences byexploiting the hierarchical nature of the context attributes. Finally; we evaluate our approachfrom two perspectives: usability and performance. Usability evaluates the overheads …,Information Systems,2011,27
Metadata modeling in a global computing environment,Dieter Pfoser; Evaggelia Pitoura; Nectaria Tryfona,Abstract Emerging computational paradigms such as global and ubiquitous computingrequire some rethinking and innovative research ideas in many computer science areas. Inthis work; we aim at studying a mobile computing scenario from the database perspective.Given a global computing environment in which data is kept in a number of small-scale; data-charged; mobile devices that use; eg; wireless networks; for communication; we want toassess the overall data scenario. We use an example to abstract the requirements to such acomputing environment and to outline the various existing types of data. Included here aresome metadata proposals related to the actual data stored in the device (content data) aswell as to the data necessary to the functioning of the device within the computingenvironment (profile data).

Data organization issues for location-dependent queries in mobile computing,Sanjay Madria; Bharat Bhargava; Evaggelia Pitoura; Vijay Kumar,Abstract We consider queries which originate from a mobile unit and whose result dependson the location of the user who initiates the query. Example of such a query is How manypeople are living in the region I am currently in?” We execute such queries based onlocation-dependent data involved in their processing. We build concept hierarchies basedon the location data. These hierarchies define mapping among different granularities oflocations. One such hierarchy is to generate domain knowledge about the cities that belongto a state. The hierarchies are used as distributed directories to assist in finding thedatabase or relation that contains the values of the location-dependent attribute in aparticular location. We extend concept hierarchies to include spatial indexes on the location-dependent attributes. Finally; we discuss how to partition and replicate relations based on …,Current Issues in Databases and Information Systems,2000,25
Digital library services in mobile computing,Bharat Bhargava; Melliyal Annamalai; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Digital libraries bring about the integration; management; and communication ofgigabytes of multimedia data in a distributed environment. Digital library systems currentlyenvision users as being static when they access information. But it is expected in the nearfuture that tens of millions of users will have access to a digital library through wirelessaccess. Providing digital library services to users whose location is constantly changing;whose network connections are through a wireless medium; and whose computing power islow necessitates modifications to existing digital library systems. In this paper; we identify theissues that arise when users are mobile; classify queries that are specific to mobile usersand introduce an architecture that supports flexible and transparent access to digital librariesfor mobile users. The main features of the architecture include a layered data …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1995,25
The PaCMAn Metacomputer: parallel computing with Java mobile agents,Paraskevas Evripidou; George Samaras; Christoforos Panayiotou; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract The PaCMAn (parallel computing with Java mobile agents) Metacomputer launchesmultiple Java mobile agents that communicate and cooperate to solve problems in parallel.Each mobile agent can travel anywhere in the Web to perform its tasks. A number ofbrokers/load forecasters keep track of the available resources and provide load forecast tothe clients. The clients select the servers that they will utilize based on the specific resourcerequirements and the load forecast. The PaCMAn mobile agents are modular; the mobileshell is separated from the specific task code of the target application. To this end; weintroduce the concept of TaskHandlers which are Java objects capable of implementing aparticular task of the target application. TaskHandlers are dynamically assigned toPaCMAn's mobile agents. We have developed and tested a prototype system with several …,Future Generation Computer Systems,2001,24
Performance analysis of distributed search in open agent systems,Vassilios V Dimakopoulos; Evaggelia Pitoura,In open multi-agent systems agents need resources provided by other agents but they arenot aware of which agents provide the particular resources. Most solutions to this problemare based on a central directory that maintains a mapping between agents and resources.However; such solutions do not scale well since the central directory becomes a bottleneckin terms of both performance and reliability. In this paper; we introduce a different approach:each agent maintains a limited size local cache in which it keeps information about kdifferent resources; that is; for each of k resources; it stores the contact information of oneagent that provides it. This creates a directed network of caches. We address the followingfundamental problem: how can an agent that needs a particular resource find an agent thatprovides it by navigating through this network of caches? We propose and analytically …,Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium; 2003. Proceedings. International,2003,23
Parallel computing using Java mobile agents,Christoforos Panayiotou; George Samaras; Evaggelia Pitoura; Paraskevas Evripidou,We propose a mobile-agent parallel processing framework that uses multiple Java mobileagents; each one of which utilizes multithreading. A mobile agent can travel at any Web siteto perform its tasks. We also introduce the concept of task handlers; which are Java objectscapable of implementing a particular task of the target application. TaskHandlers aredynamically assigned to mobile agents. We have developed and tested a prototypeapplication for parallel Web querying as a proof of concept of our proposed framework.Boosted by the inherited benefits of using Java and mobile agents; our proposedmethodology brakes the barriers of heterogeneity and provides the means for the paralleldeployment of the available on the World Wide Web computational resources.,EUROMICRO Conference; 1999.

Caching and replication in mobile data management,Evaggelia Pitoura; Panos K Chrysanthis,Abstract Mobile data management has been an active area of research for the past fifteenyears. Besides dealing with mobility itself; issues central in data management for mobilecomputing include low bandwidth; intermittent network connectivity and scarcity of resourceswith emphasis on power management. In this article; we focus on how caching andreplication in mobile data management address these challenges. We consider twoantagonistic criteria; that of ensuring quality of data in terms of consistency and coherencyand that of achieving quality of service in terms of response time and availability.,IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin,2007,22
Cache updates in a peer-to-peer network of mobile agents,Elias Leontiadis; Vassilios V Dimakopoulos; Evaggelia Pitoura,In open multi-agent systems; agents need resources provided by other agents but they arenot aware of which agents provide particular resources. We consider a peer-to-peerapproach; in which each agent maintains a local cache with information about k resources;that is for each of the k resources; an agent that provides it. However; when an agent or aresource moves; cache entries become obsolete. We propose a suite of cache updatepolicies that combine pull-based invalidation that is initiated by the agent that maintains thecache with push-based invalidation that is initiated by the agent that moves. We study andcompare variations of oblivious flooding-based push/pull along with an informed pushapproach where each agent maintains a list of the agents that have it cached. Ourexperimental results indicate that a novel variation of flooding for push where a moving …,Peer-to-Peer Computing; 2004. Proceedings. Proceedings. Fourth International Conference on,2004,22
Filters for XML-based service discovery in pervasive computing,Georgia Koloniari; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Pervasive computing refers to an emerging trend towards numerous casuallyaccessible devices connected to an increasingly ubiquitous network infrastructure. Animportant challenge in this context is discovering the appropriate data and services. In thispaper; we assume that services and data are described using hierarchically structuredmetadata. There is no centralized index for the services; instead; appropriately distributedfilters are used to route queries to the appropriate nodes. We propose two new types of filterthat extend Bloom filters for hierarchical documents. Two alternative ways are considered forbuilding overlay networks of nodes: one based on network proximity and one based oncontent similarity. Content similarity is derived from the similarity among filters. Ourexperimental results show that networks based on content similarity outperform those …,The Computer Journal,2004,22

Ymaldb: exploring relational databases via result-driven recommendations,Marina Drosou; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract The typical user interaction with a database system is through queries. However;many times users do not have a clear understanding of their information needs or the exactcontent of the database. In this paper; we propose assisting users in database explorationby recommending to them additional items; called Ymal (“You May Also Like”) results; that;although not part of the result of their original query; appear to be highly related to it. Suchitems are computed based on the most interesting sets of attribute values; called faSets; thatappear in the result of the original query. The interestingness of a faSet is defined based onits frequency in the query result and in the database. Database frequency estimations relyon a novel approach of maintaining a set of representative rare faSets.

Such architectures are part of anincreasing number of emerging applications in wireless mobile computing systems; theyalso provide a scalable means to deliver information in web-based applications; for examplein publish-subscribe systems. We introduce various forms of temporal and semanticcoherency applicable to such architectures and present a framework to precisely de. neprotocols for enforcing them.,Database Theory—ICDT 2003,2002,21
On pattern occurrences in a random text,Ioannis Fudos; Evaggelia Pitoura; Wojciech Szpankowski,Abstract Consider a given pattern H and a random text T of length n. We assume thatsymbols in the text occur independently; and various symbols have different probabilities ofoccurrence (ie; the so-called asymmetric Bernoulli model). We are concerned with theprobability of exactly r occurrences of H in the text T. We derive the generating function ofthis probability; and show that asymptotically it behaves as αn r ϱ H n− r− 1; where α is anexplicitly computed constant; and ϱ H< 1 is the root of an equation depending on thestructure of the pattern. We then extend these findings to random patterns.,Information processing letters,1996,21
On supporting context-aware preferences in relational database systems,Kostas Stefanidis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panos Vassiliadis,Abstract. A context-aware system is a system that uses context to provide relevantinformation or services to its users. While there has been a variety of context middlewareinfrastructures and context-aware applications; little work has been done in integratingcontext into database management systems. In this paper; we consider a preference systemthat facilitates context-aware OLAP queries; that is OLAP queries whose result depends onthe context at the time of their submission. We propose using data cubes to store thedependencies between context and database relations and OLAP techniques for themanipulation of context-aware queries.,International Workshop on Managing Context Information in Mobile and Pervasive Environments,2005,20
Speeding-up cache lookups in wireless ad-hoc routing using bloom filters,Evangelos Papapetrou; Evaggelia Pitoura; Kostas Lillis,On demand routing protocols that exploit local caches have received a lot of attention latelyin wireless ad-hoc networking. In this paper; we specifically address cache management; anissue that has been a main source of criticism for the applicability of such protocols. Inparticular; we tackle the problem of accessing the cache content efficiently. To this end; wepropose summarizing the cache content so that we achieve efficient lookups. This not onlysaves both the restrictive resources of the wireless devices such as computational powerand energy but also improves the overall protocol performance. We use Bloom filters assummaries. Our experimental results using the ns simulator show that both resource savingsand performance improvements are attained when such filters are integrated within the DSRprotocol which is one the most widely used instance of an on demand protocol,Personal; Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications; 2005.

Wireless computational models: Mobile agents to the rescue,Constantinos Spyrou; George Samaras; Evaggelia Pitoura; Paraskevas Evripidou,Wireless mobile computing breaks the stationary barrier and allows users to compute andaccess information anywhere and anytime. However; this new freedom of movement doesnot come without new challenges. The mobile computing environment is constrained inmany ways. Mobile elements are resource-poor and unreliable. Their network connectivity isoften achieved through low-bandwidth wireless links. Furthermore; connectivity is frequentlylost for variant periods of time. The difficulties raised by these constraints are compoundedby mobility that induces variability in the availability of both communication andcomputational resources. These severe restrictions have a great impact on the design andstructure of mobile computing applications and motivate the development of new computingmodels. To this end; a number of extensions to the traditional distributed system …,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 1999. Proceedings. Tenth International Workshop on,1999,18
Selecting shortcuts for a smaller world,Nikos Parotsidis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract The small world phenomenon is a desirable property of social networks; since itguarantees short paths between the nodes of the social graph and thus efficient informationspread on the network. It is thus in the benefit of both network users and network owners toenforce and maintain this property. In this work; we study the problem of finding a subset of kedges from a set of candidate edges whose addition to a network leads to the greatestreduction in its average shortest path length. We formulate the problem as a combinatorialoptimization problem; and show that it is NP-hard and that known approximation techniquesare not applicable. We describe an efficient method for computing the exact effect of a singleedge insertion on the average shortest path length; as well as several heuristics forefficiently estimating this effect.

TimeReach: Historical Reachability Queries on Evolving Graphs.,Konstantinos Semertzidis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Kostas Lillis,ABSTRACT Since most graphs evolve over time; it is useful to be able to query their history.We consider historical reachability queries that ask for the existence of a path in some timeinterval in the past; either in the whole duration of the interval (conjunctive queries); or in atleast one time instant in the interval (disjunctive queries). We study both alternatives ofstoring the full transitive closure of the evolving graph and of performing an online traversal.Then; we propose an appropriate reachability index; termed TimeReach index; that exploitsthe fact that most real-world graphs contain large strongly connected components. Finally;we present an experimental evaluation of all approaches; for different graph sizes; historicalquery types and time granularities.,EDBT,2015,17
Contextual Database Preferences.,Evaggelia Pitoura; Kostas Stefanidis; Panos Vassiliadis,Abstract As both the volume of data and the diversity of users accessing them increase; userpreferences offer a useful means towards improving the relevance of the query results to theinformation needs of the specific user posing the query. In this article; we focus onenhancing preferences with context. Context may express conditions on situations externalto the database or related to the data stored in the database. We outline models forexpressing both types of preferences. Then; given a user query and its surrounding context;we consider the problem of selecting related preferences to personalize the query.,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2011,16

Query workload-aware overlay construction using histograms,Georgia Koloniari; Yannis Petrakis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Thodoris Tsotsos,Abstract Peer-to-peer (p2p) systems over an efficient means of data sharing among adynamically changing set of a large number of a tonomous nodes. Each node in a p2psystem is connected with a small number of other nodes thus creating an overlay network ofnodes. A query posed at a node is routed through the overlay network towards nodeshosting data items that satisfy it. In this paper; we consider building overlays that exploit thequery workload so that nodes are clustered based on their results to a given query workload.The motivation is to create overlays where nodes that match a large number of similarqueries are a fewlinks apart. Query frequency is also taken into account so that popularqueries have a greater effect on the formation of the overlay than unpopular ones. We focuson range selection queries and se histograms to estimate the query results of each node …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2005,15

On relaxing contextual preference queries,Kostas Stefanidis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panos Vassiliadis,Personalization systems exploit preferences for providing users with only relevant data fromthe huge volume of information that is currently available. We consider preferences thatdependent on context; such as the location of the user. We model context as a set ofattributes; each taking values from hierarchical domains. Often; the context of the query maybe too specific to match any of the given preferences. In this paper; we consider possibleexpansions of the query context produced by relaxing one or more of its context attributes. Ahierarchical attribute may be relaxed upwards by replacing its value by a more general one;downwards by replacing its value by a set of more specific values or sideways by replacingits value by sibling values in the hierarchy. We present an algorithm based on a prefix-basedrepresentation of context for identifying the preferences whose context matches the …,Mobile Data Management; 2007 International Conference on,2007,14
On constructing small worlds in unstructured peer-to-peer systems,Yannis Petrakis; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Peer-to-peer systems have evolved as a means to share large amounts of dataamong autonomous nodes. A central issue in this context is locating nodes with datamatching a user query. In this paper; we consider building peer-to-peer systems with small-world properties; that is; connecting the nodes to each other so that:(i) the distance betweenany two nodes is small and (ii) relevant nodes are connected to each other. Relevancebetween nodes is defined based on the probability that the two nodes match similar queries.We propose decentralized procedures for constructing small worlds based on routingindexes that describe the content of neighboring nodes. Our experimental results show thatsmall-world peer-to-peer systems built with these procedures increase recall; that is; thepercentage of relevant results returned.,Current Trends in Database Technology-EDBT 2004 Workshops,2005,14

Providing Database Interoperability through Object-Oriented Language Constructs,Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Seamless access to resources and services provided by distributed; autonomous;and heterogeneous systems is central to many advanced applications. Building anintegrated system to provide such uniform access and cooperation among underlyingheterogeneous systems is both an increasing necessity and a formidable challenge. Animportant component of such a complex integrated system is a unified language that servesboth as a data definition and as a data manipulation tool. Special requirements are posed inthe instance of an integrated system which includes database systems among itscomponents. In this paper; we introduce the necessary constructs that an object-orientedprogramming language should provide for being adopted as the language of the integratedsystem in such a setting.

Durable graph pattern queries on historical graphs,Konstantinos Semertzidis; Evaggelia Pitoura,In this paper; we focus on labeled graphs that evolve over time. Given a sequence of graphsnapshots representing the state of the graph at different time instants; we seek to find themost durable matches of an input graph pattern query; that is; the matches that exist for thelongest period of time. The straightforward way to address this problem is by running a state-of-the-art graph pattern algorithm at each snapshot and aggregating the results. However;for large networks this approach is computationally expensive; since all matches have to begenerated at each snapshot; including those appearing only once. We propose a newapproach that uses a compact representation of the sequence of graph snapshots;appropriate time indexes to prune the search space and a threshold on the duration of thepattern to determine the search order. We also present experimental results using real …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,12
ReDRIVE: result-driven database exploration through recommendations,Marina Drosou; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Typically; users interact with database systems by formulating queries. However;many times users do not have a clear understanding of their information needs or the exactcontent of the database; thus; their queries are of an exploratory nature. In this paper; wepropose assisting users in database exploration by recommending to them additional itemsthat are highly related with the items in the result of their original query. Such items arecomputed based on the most interesting sets of attribute values (or faSets) that appear in theresult of the original user query. The interestingness of a faSet is defined based on itsfrequency both in the query result and in the database instance. Database frequencyestimations rely on a novel approach that employs an e-tolerance closed rare faSetsrepresentation.

Centrality-aware link recommendations,Nikos Parotsidis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Link recommendations are critical for both improving the utility and expediting thegrowth of social networks. Most previous approaches focus on suggesting links that arehighly likely to be adopted. In this paper; we add a different perspective to the problem byaiming at recommending links that also improve specific properties of the network. Inparticular; our goal is to recommend to users links that if adopted would improve theircentrality in the network. Specifically; we introduce the centrality-aware link recommendationproblem as the problem of recommending to a user u; k links from a pool of recommendedlinks so as to maximize the expected decrease of the sum of the shortest path distances of $u $ to all other nodes in the network. We show that the problem is NP-hard; but ouroptimization function is monotone and sub-modular which guarantees a constant …,Proceedings of the Ninth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2016,11
Multiple radii disc diversity: Result diversification based on dissimilarity and coverage,Marina Drosou; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Recently; result diversification has attracted a lot of attention as a means to improvethe quality of results retrieved by user queries. In this article; we introduce a novel definitionof diversity called DisC diversity. Given a tuning parameter r; which we call radius; weconsider two items to be similar if their distance is smaller than or equal to r. A DisC diversesubset of a result contains items such that each item in the result is represented by a similaritem in the diverse subset and the items in the diverse subset are dissimilar to each other.We show that locating a minimum DisC diverse subset is an NP-hard problem and providealgorithms for its approximation. We extend our definition to the multiple radii case; whereeach item is associated with a different radius based on its importance; relevance; or otherfactors. We also propose adapting DisC diverse subsets to a different degree of …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2015,11
Partial view selection for evolving social graphs,Georgia Koloniari; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract In this paper; we deal with the problem of historical query evaluation over evolvingsocial graphs. Historical queries are queries about the social graph in the past. Thestraightforward way of executing such a query is by first reconstructing the whole socialgraph at the given time instance or interval; and then; evaluating the query on thereconstructed graph. Since social graphs are large; the cost of a complete graph snapshotreconstruction would dominate the cost of historical query execution. Given that manyqueries are user-centric; ie; node-centric queries that require access only of a targetedsubgraph; we propose deploying partial view instead of full snapshot construction anddefine conditions that determine when a partial view can be used to evaluate a query. Wealso propose using a cache of partial views to further reduce the query evaluation cost …,First International Workshop on Graph Data Management Experiences and Systems,2013,11
A game-theoretic approach to the formation of clustered overlay networks,Georgia Koloniari; Evaggelia Pitoura,In many large-scale content sharing applications; participants or nodes are connected witheach other based on their content or interests; thus forming clusters. In this paper; we modelthe formation of such clustered overlays as a strategic game; where nodes determine theircluster membership with the goal of improving the recall of their queries. We study theevolution of such overlays both theoretically and experimentally in terms of stability;optimality; load balance; and the required overhead. We show that; in general; decisionsmade independently by each node using only local information lead to overall cost-effectivecluster configurations that are also dynamically adaptable to system updates such as churnand query or content changes.,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2012,11

Tracker: A universal location management system for mobile agents,George Samaras; Constantinos Spyrou; Evaggelia Pitoura; Marios Dikaiakos,ABSTRACT This paper presents TRAcKER;* a distributed “location management”middleware which has the ability to manage the location of mobile agents that travelindependently the Internet in search of useful information. A major goal for this middlewareis to be flexible and effective; to respond to the demands posed by the environment it aims toassist: an environment that deals with users that are accessing the Internet via static ormobile units of limited resources (eg; palmtops; handheld devices; WAP-phones) andutilizing mobile agents that are moving “autonomously” and asynchronously around theInternet with small; medium and in many cases high moving frequency. The mechanism wepropose is modular; simple; of low overhead and able to serve all the Java based mobileagent platforms. In addition; is quite generic able to dynamically incorporate various …,European Wireless; Feb,2002,11
DBGlobe: A data-centric approach to global computing,Alexandros Karakasidis; Evaggelia Pitoura,In the near future; there will be increasingly powerful computers in smart cards; telephones;and other information appliances.

The SMart autonomous storage (SmAS) system,VV Dimakopoulos; A Kinalis; S Mastrogiannakis; E Pitoura,The increasing demand for storage capacity and throughput has generated a need forstorage architectures that scale their processing power with the growing size of datasets. Inthis paper; we give an overview of the SmAS system that employs network attached diskswith processing capabilities. In the SmAS system; users can deploy and execute code at thedisk. At-the-disk executed application code is written in a stream-based language thatenforces code security and bounds the code's memory requirements. The SmAS disk'ssystem software provides basic support for process scheduling and memory management.We present an initial implementation of the system and report performance results thatvalidate our approach.,Communications; Computers and signal Processing; 2001.

Recommending packages to groups,Shuyao Qi; Nikos Mamoulis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panayiotis Tsaparas,The success of recommender systems has made them the focus of a massive research effortin both industry and academia. Recent work has generalized recommendations to suggestpackages of items to single users; or single items to groups of users. However; to the best ofour knowledge; the interesting problem of recommending a package to a group of users(P2G) has not been studied to date. This is a problem with several practical applications;such as recommending vacation packages to tourist groups; entertainment packages togroups of friends; or sets of courses to groups of students. In this paper; we formulate theP2G problem; and we propose probabilistic models that capture the preference of a grouptowards a package; incorporating factors such as user impact and package viability. We alsoinvestigate the issue of recommendation fairness. This is a novel consideration that arises …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on,2016,10
Distributed in-memory processing of all k nearest neighbor queries,Georgios Chatzimilioudis; Constantinos Costa; Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Wang-Chien Lee; Evaggelia Pitoura,A wide spectrum of Internet-scale mobile applications; ranging from social networking;gaming and entertainment to emergency response and crisis management; all requireefficient and scalable All k Nearest Neighbor (AkNN) computations over millions of movingobjects every few seconds to be operational. Most traditional techniques for computingAkNN queries are centralized; lacking both scalability and efficiency. Only recently;distributed techniques for shared-nothing cloud infrastructures have been proposed toachieve scalability for large datasets. These batch-oriented algorithms are sub-optimal dueto inefficient data space partitioning and data replication among processing units. In thispaper; we present Spitfire; a distributed algorithm that provides a scalable and high-performance AkNN processing framework.

One is enough: distributed filtering for duplicate elimination,Georgia Koloniari; Nikos Ntarmos; Evaggelia Pitoura; Dimitris Souravlias,Abstract The growth of online services has created the need for duplicate elimination in high-volume streams of events. The sheer volume of data in applications such as pay-per-clickclickstream processing; RSS feed syndication and notification services in social sites suchTwitter and Facebook makes traditional centralized solutions hard to scale. In this paper; wepropose an approach based on distributed filtering. To this end; we introduce a suite ofdistributed Bloom filters that exploit different ways of partitioning the event space. To addressthe continuous nature of event delivery; the filters are extended to support sliding windowsemantics. Moreover; we examine locality-related tradeoffs and propose a tree-basedarchitecture to allow for duplicate elimination across geographic locations.

A recall-based cluster formation game in peer-to-peer systems,Georgia Koloniari; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract In many large-scale content sharing applications; participants or peers are groupedtogether forming clusters based on their content or interests. In this paper; we deal with themaintenance of such clusters in the presence of updates. We model the evolution of thesystem as a strategic game; where peers determine their cluster membership based on autility function of the query recall. Peers are guided either by selfish or altruistic motives:selfish peers aim at improving the recall of their own queries; whereas altruistic peers aim atimproving the recall of the queries of other peers. We study the evolution of such clustersboth theoretically and experimentally under a variety of conditions. We show that; in general;local decisions made independently by each peer enable the system to adapt to changesand maintain the overall recall of the query workload.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,10
Recall-based cluster reformulation by selfish peers,Georgia Koloniari; Evaggelia Pitoura,Recently; clustered overlays in which peers are grouped based on the similarity of theircontent or interests have been proposed to improve performance in peer-to-peer systems.Since such systems are highly dynamic; the overlay network needs to be updated frequentlyto cope with changes. In this paper; we introduce an approach for updating a clusteredoverlay based on local decisions made by individual peers. We model the cluster-reformulation problem as a game where peers determine their cluster membership based onpotential gains in the recall of their queries. We also define global criteria for the overallquality of the system and propose strategies for peer relocation that consider differentbehavioral patterns for the peers. Our preliminary experimental evaluation shows that ourstrategies cope well with changes in the overlay network.,Data Engineering Workshop; 2008. ICDEW 2008.

Adaptive multiversion data broadcast organizations,Oleg Shigiltchoff; Panos K Chrysanthis; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Broadcasting provides an efficient means for disseminating information in bothwired and wireless setting. In this paper; we propose a suite of broadcast organizationschemes for multiversion data broadcast; ie; data broadcast in which more than one value isbroadcast per data item. Besides increasing the concurrency of client transactions;multiversion broadcast provides clients with the possibility of accessing multiple serverstates. For example; such a functionality is essential to support applications that requireaccess to data sequences and have limited local memory to store the previous versions;such as in the case of sensor networks. We identify two basic multiversion organizations;namely vertical and horizontal broadcasts and propose an efficient compression schemeapplicable to both. We also consider a multiversion client data cache and introduce …,Information Systems,2004,10
An access control mechanism for large scale data dissemination systems,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Evaggelia Pitoura,Automatic data dissemination systems are becoming increasingly relevant in Internet-basedinformation systems. In such systems; users subscribe to the dissemination service byproviding interest profiles. These profiles are then used to determine which informationshould be delivered to which users; whenever new information is entered into the system. Amain shortcoming of existing dissemination systems is the lack of any access controlmechanisms; enabling selective information dissemination based for example on security orother regulatory policies. We present an access control model suitable for disseminationsystems. The model is based on user profiles containing both user interests and usercredentials (ie; a set of attributes characterizing users for access control purposes).Information is then filtered before being delivered to users on the basis of both the user …,Research Issues in Data Engineering; 2001.

Diverse set selection over dynamic data,Marina Drosou; Evaggelia Pitoura,Result diversification has recently attracted considerable attention as a means of increasinguser satisfaction in recommender systems; as well as in web and database search. In thispaper; we focus on the problem of selecting the k-most diverse items from a result set.Whereas previous research has mainly considered the static version of the problem; in thispaper; we exploit the dynamic case in which the result set changes over time; as forexample; in the case of notification services. We define the CONTINUOUS k-DIVERSITYPROBLEM along with appropriate constraints that enforce continuity requirements on thediversified results. Our proposed approach is based on cover trees and supports dynamicitem insertion and deletion.

How people describe themselves on Twitter,Konstantinos Semertzidis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Twitter; being both a micro-blogging service and a social network; has become oneof the primary means of communicating and disseminating information online. As such;significant amount of research has been devoted to analyzing the Twitter graph; the tweets;and the behavior of its users. In this work; we undertake a study of the user profile bios onTwitter. The goal of our study is two-fold: first; to understand what Twitter users choose toexpose about themselves in their profile bio; and second; to investigate if it is possible toexploit the information in the user bio for tasks such as predicting connections betweenTwitter users.,Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD Workshop on Databases and Social Networks,2013,9
Preferential publish/subscribe,Marina Drosou; Evaggelia Pitoura; Kostas Stefanidis,ABSTRACT In publish/subscribe systems; subscribers express their interests in specificevents and get notified about all published events that match their interests. As the amountof information generated increases rapidly; to control the amount of data delivered to users;we propose enhancing publish/subscribe systems with a ranking mechanism; so that onlythe top-ranked matching events are delivered. Ranking is based on letting users expresstheir preferences on events by ordering the associated subscriptions. To avoid the blockingof new notifications by top-ranked old ones; we associate with each notification an expirationtime. We have fully implemented our approach in SIENA; a popular publish/subscribemiddleware system.,Proceeding of the 2nd International Workshop on Personalized Access; Profile Management and Context Awareness: Databases (PersDB 2008); in conjunction with the VLDB 2008 Conference,2008,9
Mobile agent-based services for view materialization,Kyriakos Karenos; George Samaras; Panos K Chrysanthis; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Mobile agents are ideal for mobile computing environments because of their abilityto support asynchronous communication and disconnected data processing.

Multiversion data broadcast organizations,Oleg Shigiltchoff; Panos Chrysanthis; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract In recent years broadcasting attracted considerable attention as a promisingtechnique of disseminating information to large number of clients in wireless environment aswell as in the web. In this paper; we study different schemes of multiversion broadcast andshow that the way broadcast is organized has an impact on performance; as different kind ofclients needs different types of data. We identify two basic multiversion organizations;namely Vertical and Horizontal broadcasts; and propose an efficient compression schemeapplicable to both. The compression can significantly reduce the size of the broadcast andconsequently; the average access time; while it does not require costly decompression. Bothorganizations and the compression scheme were evaluated using simulation.,Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2002,9

Along with the results ofeach user query; YmalDB computes and presents to the users additional results; calledYmal (ie;" You May Also Like") results; that are highly related with the results of their originalquery. Such results are computed using the most interesting sets of attribute values; calledfaSets; that appear either in the results of the original query or in the results of anappropriately expanded one. The interestingness of a faSet is based on its frequency both inthe query result and in the database.,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,8
Distributed structural relaxation of XPath queries,Georgia Koloniari; Evaggelia Pitoura,Due to the structural heterogeneity of XML; queries are often interpreted approximately. Thisis achieved by relaxing the query and ranking the results based on their relevance to theoriginal query. Query relaxation over distributed XML repositories may incur largecommunication costs; since partial result lists from different sites need to be gathered andranked to assembly the overall top-k results. To process such queries efficiently; we proposeusing a distributed clustered index to group documents based on their structural similarity.The clustered index proves to be very effective in reducing the sizes of the partial lists thatneed to be combined. Furthermore; it can be used as the basis of a pay-as-you-goapproach; where clusters of documents are accessed gradually providing the user withincreasingly improving results.

Timely provisioning of mobile services in critical pervasive environments,Filippos Papadopoulos; Apostolos Zarras; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panos Vassiliadis,Abstract Timeliness in conventional real-time systems is addressed by employing well-known scheduling techniques that guarantee the execution of a number of tasks withincertain deadlines. However; these classical scheduling techniques do not take into accountbasic features that characterize today's critical pervasive computing environments. In thispaper; we revisit the issue of timeliness in the context of pervasive computing environments.We propose a middleware service that addresses the timely provisioning of services; whiletaking into account both the mobility of the entities that constitute pervasive computingenvironments and the existence of multiple alternative entities; providing semanticallycompatible services.

Tracking Mobile Users Using Hierarchical Location Databases,Evaggelia Pitoura; Ioannis Fudos,Abstract To accommodate the increase in user population in future personal communicationsystems; hierarchical architectures of location databases have been proposed. In this paper;a scheme based on forwarding pointers is presented; that reduces the cost of network anddatabase tra c generated by frequent location updates in such hierarchical architectures. Toavoid the building up of long chains of forwarding pointers; various purging strategies arealso introduced. We comparatively study the communication and database cost of the nonforwarding and of the forwarding schemes along with a set of di erent purging strategies fora range of call to mobility ratios and for users with di erent moving and calling behaviors. Anadaptive scheme is then proposed that takes advantage of these studies.

Preference-based query personalization,Georgia Koutrika; Evaggelia Pitoura; Kostas Stefanidis,Abstract In the context of database queries; computational methods for handling preferencescan be broadly divided into two categories. Query personalization methods consider thatuser preferences are provided as a user profile separately from the query and dynamicallydetermine how this profile will affect the query results. On the other hand; preferential queryanswering methods consider that preferences are explicitly expressed within queries. Thefocus of this chapter is on query personalization methods. We will first describe howpreferences can be represented and stored in user profiles. Then; we will discuss howpreferences are selected from a user profile and applied to a query.,*,2013,7

Context-aware query processing in ad-hoc environments of peers,Nikolaos Folinas; Panos Vassiliadis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Evangelos Papapetrou; Apostolos Zarras,Abstract In this article; we deal with context-aware query processing in ad-hoc peer-to-peernetworks. Each peer in such an environment has a database over which users executequeries. This database involves (a) relations which are locally stored and (b) virtualrelations; all the tuples of which are collected from peers that are present in the network atthe time when a query is posed. The objective of our work is to perform query processing insuch an environment and; to this end; we start with a formal definition of the system model.Next; we formally define SQLP; an extension of SQL that covers the termination of queries;the failure of individual peers and the semantic characteristics of the peers of such anetwork. Moreover; we present a query execution algorithm as well as the formal definitionof all the operators that take place in a query execution plan.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT],Journal of Electronic Commerce in Organizations,2008,6

In this paper; we assume that we are given thehistory of a graph in the form of a sequence of graph snapshots. Our goal is to define thedifferent types of queries that one can ask regarding the graph history and present an initialapproach to storing graph snapshots and processing historical queries in a native graphdatabase. We define three general types of historical queries; namely; historical graphqueries; historical time queries and historical top-k queries. We present two representationsof graph snapshots that use either a single or a multi-edge approach. We evaluate the twoapproaches experimentally for various types of historical reachability queries.,EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2016,5
Diffusion maximization in evolving social networks,Nathalie TH Gayraud; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Diffusion in social networks has been studied extensively in the past few years.Most previous work assumes that the underlying network is a static object that remainsunchanged as the diffusion process progresses. However; there are several real-lifenetworks that change dynamically over time. In this paper; we study diffusion on suchevolving networks and extend the popular Independent Cascade and Linear Thresholdmodels to account for network evolution. In particular; we introduce two natural variations; apersistent and a transient one; to capture diffusions of different types. We consider theproblem of influence maximization where the goal is to select a few influential nodes toinitiate a diffusion with maximum spread.

Goodness is determined by the relevance of thedocuments in the collection to the query. We consider keyword queries and support LowestCommon Ancestor (LCA) semantics for defining query results; where the relevance of eachdocument to a query is determined by properties of the LCA of those nodes in the XMLdocument that contain the query keywords. To avoid evaluating queries against eachdocument in a collection; we propose maintaining in a preprocessing phase; informationabout the LCAs of all pairs of keywords in a document and use it to approximate theproperties of the LCA-based results of a query.

Geometric-similarity retrieval in large image bases,Ioannis Fudos; Leonidas Palios; Evaggelia Pitoura,We propose a novel approach to shape-based image retrieval that builds upon a similaritycriterion which is based on the average point set distance. Compared to traditionaltechniques; such as dimensionality reduction; our method exhibits better behavior in that itmaintains the average topology of shapes independently of the number of points used torepresent them and is more resilient to noise. An efficient algorithm is presented based onan incremental" fattening;" of the query shape until the best match is discovered. Thealgorithm uses simplex range search techniques and fractional cascading to provide anaverage polylogarithmic time complexity on the total number of shape vertices. Thealgorithm is extended to perform additional fast approximate matching; when there is noimage sufficiently similar to the query image. We present techniques for the efficient …,Data Engineering; 2002. Proceedings. 18th International Conference on,2002,5

Replication routing indexes for xml documents,Panos Skyvalidas; Evaggelia Pitoura; V Dimakopoulos,Abstract. Peer-to-peer systems have attracted considerable attention as a means of sharingcontent among large and dynamic communities of nodes. In this paper; we consider sharingof XML documents. We propose a simple yet efficient replication method that is based onreplication routing indexes. A replication routing index for a node is a path-based XML indexthat summarizes access information for each of the links of the node. The replication routingindexes are used for determining both the granularity of the XML fragments to be replicatedas well as the appropriate sites for placing the fragments. We also present experimentalresults of the deployment of our indexes in a dynamic unstructured peer-to-peer system.,DBISP2P Workshop,2007,4
On accessing GSM-enabled mobile sensors,Zissis K Plitsis; Joannis Fudos; Evaggelia Pitoura; Apostolos Zarras,In this paper; we propose a middleware framework that unifies access to GSM-enabledsensor devices in a global computing environment. Typically; communication with mobilesensors relies on proprietary protocols; involving the exchange of SMS and MMS messages.In the proposed framework; we use XML-based control descriptions that abstractly specifythese protocols to generate proxies and corresponding WEB-based (HTML; WAP and WEBservices) interfaces that realize them. Thus; we provide access transparency over differentkinds of mobile sensors. Besides the overall architecture of the proposed framework; wediscuss a particular instance where a GSM-enabled camera with temperature; and motiondetection sensors is incorporated into our global computing environment.

Query management over ad-hoc communities of web services,Apostolos Zarras; Panos Vassiliadis; Evaggelia Pitoura,In this paper; we present CONSERV-a middleware infrastructure for the development ofvirtual databases in pervasive computing environments. CONSERV provides an SQL front-end for posing and processing queries on information provided by ad-hoc communities ofWeb services hosted by peers that arbitrarily join and leave the system. The cornerstone ofthe proposed infrastructure is the fact that we replace the traditional treatment of databasesas persistent collections of records by the assumption that a database relation is a collectionof records dynamically compiled from such ad-hoc sets of peers. Each peer offers data to therelations through a workflow of Web services. Another aspect of our approach is that weconfine query processing over specific sets of peers that we call communities.

Broadcast data organizations and client side cache,Oleg Shigiltchoff; Panos K Chrysanthis; Evaggelia Pitoura,Broadcasting provides an efficient means for disseminating information in both wired andwireless setting. In this paper; we study different client side cache organizations for varioustypes of multiversion data broadcast; ie; data broadcast in which more than one value isbroadcast per data item. Besides increasing the concurrency of client transactions;multiversion broadcast provides clients with the possibility of accessing multiple serverstates. For example; such a functionality is essential to support applications that requireaccess to data sequences and have limited local memory to store the previous versions;such as in the case of sensor networks.,Distributed Computing Systems Workshops; 2003.

Extending an object-oriented programming language to support the integration of heterogeneous database systems,Evaggelia Pitoura,Many advanced applications need to access and integrate resources and services providedby distributed; autonomous; and heterogeneous systems. Building an integrated system toprovide uniform access and cooperation among these underlying heterogeneous systems isboth an increasing necessity and a formidable challenge. An important component of such acomplex integrated system is a language that would serve both as a data definition and as adata manipulation tool. Special requirements are posed in the instance of an integratedsystem which includes database systems among its components. In this paper; we presentthe necessary constructs that an object-oriented programming language should provide forbeing adopted as the language of the integrated system in such a setting.,System Sciences; 1995.

Troll vulnerability in online social networks,Paraskevas Tsantarliotis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Trolling describes a range of antisocial online behaviors that aim at disrupting the normaloperation of online social networks and media. Combating trolling is an important problem inthe online world. Existing approaches rely on human-based or automatic mechanisms foridentifying trolls and troll posts. In this paper we take a novel approach to the trollingproblem: our goal is to identify the targets of the trolls; so as to prevent trolling before ithappens. We thus define the troll vulnerability prediction problem; where given a post weaim at predicting whether it is vulnerable to trolling. Towards this end; we define a novel trollvulnerability metric of how likely a post is to be attacked by trolls; and we construct modelsfor predicting troll-vulnerable posts; using features from the content and the history of thepost.

Topic Detection Using a Critical Term Graph on News-Related Tweets.,Paraskevas Tsantarliotis; Evaggelia Pitoura,ABSTRACT Social media and online social networks are playing an increasingly importantrole in our lives; as they attract millions of users around the world. Twitter; one of the mostpopular micro-blogging services; holds a special position among them; since informationshared through this service spreads faster than it would have been possible with traditionalsources. There are many interesting works analyzing the information that flows throughTwitter. Most of such research focuses on trending topic detection; ie what are the peopletalking about right now. We propose a new method to detect topics using a graph; wherenodes correspond to terms and edges correspond to co-occurrence of the two terms in thetweet stream. Dense subgraphs; of this graph; pose special interest; as the nodes that arehighly connected share a special relation. Thus; the corresponding terms potentially …,EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2015,3
Identifying Converging Pairs of Nodes on a Budget.,Konstantina Lazaridou; Konstantinos Semertzidis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panayiotis Tsaparas,ABSTRACT In this paper; we consider large graphs that evolve over time; such as graphsthat model social networks. Given two instances of the graph at two points in time; we ask toidentify the top pairs of nodes whose shortest path distance has decreased the most. We callthese pairs converging. The straightforward way to address this problem is by computing theshortest path distances of all pairs at both instances and keeping the ones with the largestdifferences. Since for large networks this is computationally infeasible; we consider abudgeted version of the problem; where given a fixed budget of single-source shortest pathcomputations; we seek to identify nodes that participate in as many converging pairs aspossible. We evaluate a number of different approaches for our problem; that employcentrality-based; dispersion-based; and landmark-based distance estimation metrics. We …,EDBT,2015,3
Rapid aknn query processing for fast classification of multidimensional data in the cloud,Nikolaos Nodarakis; Spyros Sioutas; Dimitrios Tsoumakos; Giannis Tzimas; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract: A $ k $-nearest neighbor ($ k $ NN) query determines the $ k $ nearest points;using distance metrics; from a specific location. An all $ k $-nearest neighbor (A $ k $ NN)query constitutes a variation of a $ k $ NN query and retrieves the $ k $ nearest points foreach point inside a database. Their main usage resonates in spatial databases and theyconsist the backbone of many location-based applications and not only (ie $ k $ NN joins indatabases; classification in data mining). So; it is very crucial to develop methods thatanswer them efficiently. In this work; we propose a novel method for classifyingmultidimensional data using an A $ k $ NN algorithm in the MapReduce framework.

Query optimization,Evaggelia Pitoura,In general; the term Quadtree refers to a class of representations of geometric entities (suchas points; line segments; polygons; regions) in a space of two (or more) dimensions; thatrecursively decompose the space containing these entities into blocks until the data in eachblock satisfy some condition (with respect; for example; to the block size; the number of blockentities; the characteristics of the block entities; etc.). In a more restricted sense; the termQuadtree (Octree) refers to a tree data-structure in which each internal node has four (eight)children and is used for the representation of geometric entities in a two (three) dimensionalspace.

A Clustered Index Approach to Distributed XPath Processing,Georgia Koloniari; Evaggelia Pitoura,Supporting top-k queries over distributed collections of schemaless XML data poses twochallenges. While XML supports expressive query languages such as XPath and XQuery;these languages require schema knowledge so as to write an appropriate query which maynot be available in distributed systems with autonomous and dynamic sources. Thus; thereis a need for approximate query processing. Furthermore; retrieving the top-k results incurslarge communication and processing cost; since partial result lists from numerous sites needto be combined and ranked to assembly the top-k answers. To address both of these issues;we present an approach for approximate XPath processing over distributed collections ofXML data based on a clustered path index; where data is grouped based on structuralinformation.

Mostprevious work addresses the influence maximization problem of selecting an appropriate setof seed nodes to initiate the diffusion process so that the largest number of nodes isreached. Since the seed selection problem is NP hard; most solutions are sub-optimal.Furthermore; there may be settings in which the seed nodes are predetermined. Thus; anatural question that arise is: given a set of seed nodes; can we select a small set of nodessuch that if we improve their reaction to the diffusion process; the largest increase indiffusion spread is achieved? We call this problem; the boost set selection problem.

The DisC Diversity Model.,Marina Drosou; Evaggelia Pitoura,1. DISC DIVERSITY Diversification has attracted considerable attention; often as a means ofenhancing the quality of the query results presented to users [3]. Most diversification approachesrely on assigning a diversity score to each data item and then selecting as diverse either thek items with the largest score for a given k (eg; [1]); or the items with score larger than some predefinedthreshold (eg; [9]). In our work [4; 5]; we address diversity through a different perspective andaim at selecting a representative subset that contains items that are both dissimilar with eachother and cover the whole result set. Let P be a set of items. We define similarity between twoitems using a distance metric d.

Tohelp users find interesting items from this huge volume of available information;personalization systems allow users to directly or indirectly indicate preferences. Suchpreferences may depend on context; for instance; on the device used to access information.In this paper; we consider a preference model that allows users to assign interest scores topieces of data based on context.

Data replication in p2p systems,Vassilios V Dimakopoulos; Spiridoula Margariti; Mirto Ntetsika; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Maintaining multiple copies of data items is a commonly used mechanism forimproving the performance and fault-tolerance of any distributed system. By placing copiesof data items closer to their requesters; the response time of queries can be improved. Anadditional reason for replication is load balancing. For instance; by allocating many copiesto popular data items; the query load can be evenly distributed among the servers that holdthese copies. Similarly; by eliminating hotspots; replication can lead to a better distribution ofthe communication load over the network links. Besides performance-related reasons;replication improves system availability; since the larger the number of copies of an item; themore site failures can be tolerated. In this chapter we survey replication methods applicableto p2p systems. Although there exist some general techniques; methodologies are …,*,2010,1
Data broadcasting; caching and replication in mobile computing,Panos K Chrysanthis; Evaggelia Pitoura,realized using such logical structures. For example; in tree based data acquisition protocols;a collection tree is built that is rooted at the data collection center such as the sink node [8].The dissemination of the data requests from the participating nodes and collection of datafrom the sensor nodes are accomplished using this tree. A cluster based data acquisitionmechanism has been proposed in [3]. As shown in Fig. 1; nodes are organized into a fixednumber of clusters; and nodes within each cluster dynamically elect a cluster head. The dataacquisition is carried out in two phases. In the first phase; cluster heads collect data fromtheir cluster nodes. In the second phase; cluster heads send collected data to the nodes thathave subscribed to the data. The cluster heads are re-elected to balance energyconsumption among the nodes in the cluster. Zhang et al.[13] have proposed an adaptive …,*,2009,1
A recall-based cluster formation game in peer-to-peer systems (extended version),Georgia Koloniari; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract In many large-scale content sharing applications; participants or peers are groupedtogether forming clusters based on their content or interests. In this paper; we deal with themaintenance of such clusters in the presence of updates. We model the evolution of thesystem as a game; where peers determine their cluster membership based on a utilityfunction of the query recall. Peers are guided either by selfish or altruistic motives: selfishpeers aim at improving the recall of their own queries; whereas altruistic peers aim atimproving the recall of the queries of other peers. We study the evolution of such clustersboth theoretically and experimentally under a variety of conditions. We show that; in general;local decisions made independently by each peer enable the system to adapt to changesand maintain the overall recall of the query workload.,*,2009,1
Related Work on Context-Aware Systems,Kostas Stefanidis; Evaggelia Pitoura,Schilit [1] notes that three important aspects of context are: where you are; who you are with;and what resources are nearby. Context encompasses more than just the user's location;because other things of interest are also mobile and changing. Context includes lighting;noise level; network connectivity; communication costs; communication bandwidth; andeven the social situation; eg; whether you are with your manager or with a co-worker.Context has been tied to ubiquitous computing; although the term has had several meaningsthat differ subtly. One challenge of mobile distributed computing is to exploit the changingenvironment with a new class of applications that are aware of the context in which they arerun. Such context-aware software adapts according to the location of use; the collection ofnearby people; hosts; and accessible devices; as well as to changes to such things over …,*,2004,1
Mobile computing,Omran Bukhres; Evaggelia Pitoura; Arkady Zaslavsky,Abstract Mobile computing has emerged as a convergence of wireless communications andcomputer technologies.

Recommending packages with validity constraints to groups of users,Shuyao Qi; Nikos Mamoulis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract The success of recommender systems has made them the focus of a massiveresearch effort in both industry and academia. Recent work has generalizedrecommendations to suggest packages of items to single users; or single items to groups ofusers. However; to the best of our knowledge; the interesting problem of recommending apackage to a group of users (P2G) has not been studied to date. This is a problem withseveral practical applications; such as recommending vacation packages to tourist groups;entertainment packages to groups of friends or sets of courses to groups of students. In thispaper; we formulate the P2G problem; and we propose probabilistic models that capture thepreference of a group toward a package; incorporating factors such as user impact andpackage viability.

HiNode: an asymptotically space-optimal storage model for historical queries on graphs,Andreas Kosmatopoulos; Kostas Tsichlas; Anastasios Gounaris; Spyros Sioutas; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Most modern networks are perpetually evolving and can be modeled by graph datastructures. By collecting and indexing the state of a graph at various time instances we areable to perform queries on its entire history and thus gain insight into its fundamentalfeatures and attributes. This calls for advanced solutions for graph history storing andindexing that are capable of supporting application queries efficiently while coping with theaggravated space requirements. To this end; we advocate a purely vertex-centric storagemodel that is asymptotically space-optimal and more space efficient than any other proposalto date. In addition to space efficiency; the model's purely vertex-centric approach showsgreat promise with respect to the efficiency and functionality of update and query operations.Furthermore; we make a qualitative comparison with other general methods for graph …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2017,*
Defining and predicting troll vulnerability in online social media,Paraskevas Tsantarliotis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Trolling describes a range of antisocial online behaviors that aim at disrupting thenormal operation of online social networks and media. Existing approaches to combatingtrolling rely on human-based or automatic mechanisms for identifying trolls and troll posts. Inthis paper; we take a novel approach to the problem: our goal is to identify troll vulnerableposts; that is; posts that are potential targets of trolls; so as to prevent trolling before ithappens. To this end; we define three natural axioms that a troll vulnerability metric mustsatisfy and introduce metrics that satisfy them. We then define the troll vulnerabilityprediction problem; where given a post we aim at predicting whether it is vulnerable totrolling. We construct models that use features from the content and the history of the post forthe prediction. Our experiments with real data from Reddit demonstrate that our approach …,Social Network Analysis and Mining,2017,*
Historical Traversals in Native Graph Databases,Konstantinos Semertzidis; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Since most graph data; such as data from social; citation and computer networksevolve over time; it is useful to be able to query their history. In this paper; we focus onsupporting traversals of such graphs using a native graph database. We assume that we aregiven the history of an evolving graph as a sequence of graph snapshots representing thestate of the graph at different time instances. We introduce models for storing suchsnapshots in the graph database and we propose algorithms for supporting various types ofhistorical reachability and shortest path queries. Finally; we experimentally evaluate andcompare the various models and algorithms using both real and synthetic datasets.,Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2017,*

Sentiment-Based Topic Suggestion for Micro-Reviews.,Ziyu Lu; Nikos Mamoulis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Location-based social sites; such as Foursquare or Yelp; are gaining increasingpopularity. These sites allow users to check in at venues and leave a short commentary inthe form of a micro-review. Micro-reviews are rich in content as they offer a distilled andconcise account of user experience. In this paper we consider the problem of predicting thetopic of a micro-review by a user who visits a new venue. Such a prediction can help usersmake informed decisions; and also help venue owners personalize users' experiences.However; topic modeling for micro-reviews is particularly difficult; due to their short andfragmented nature. We address this issue using pooling strategies; which aggregate micro-reviews at the venue or user level; and we propose novel probabilistic models based onLatent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for extracting the topics related to a user-venue pair.

Iterator,Evaggelia Pitoura,An example of index oriented towards human navigation is the web directory. In such anindex; links to sites are organized into hierarchical categories; according to the sites'contents. In web directories; normally the tasks of collecting and categorizing pages arecarried out under supervision of human editors. An example of index not oriented to humansis a hidden list of metadata. Metadata are data about data. As a mean of assisting a searchengine to locate content or an information entity; they can be used to describe that content orentity. While not visible to humans; this information can provide contextual clues to automaticalgorithms used by search engines.,Encyclopedia of Database Systems,2009,*

Selectivity estimation,Evaggelia Pitoura,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,*,2009,*

Pipelining,Evaggelia Pitoura,P/FDM [5–7] integrated a functional data model with the logic programming language Prologfor general-purpose computation. The data model can be seen as an Entity-Relationshipdiagram with sub-types; much like a UML Class Diagram. The idea was for the user to beable to define a computation over objects in the diagram; instead of just using it as a schemadesign aid.

Access Path,Evaggelia Pitoura,1. Software non-determinism: A software system is non-deterministic if; when re-executed; itresults in a different execution path than a prior execution. Non-determinism can arise when;for example; paths are determined by relative processor speed or the sequence of externalevents. Such software bugs have been called ''Heisenbugs''(hard failures being ''Bohrbugs'').2. Soft hardware failures: Hardware can also suffer from ''Heisenbugs.''For example; atransient hardware failure may be triggered by an environmental cause; such as a cosmicray changing a memory bit; etc. 3. Operator failures: Systems occasionally require operatorintervention. Operators; being human; make mistakes. An operator is unlikely to make thesame mistake at the same point in a subsequent execution.,*,2009,*
A Clustered Index Approach to Distributed XPath,Georgia Koloniari; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract-Supporting top-k queries over distributed collections of schemaless XML dataposes two challenges. While XML supports expressive query languages such as XPath andXQuery; these languages require schema knowledge so as to write an appropriate querywhich may not be available in distributed systems with autonomous and dynamic sources.Thus; there is a need for approximate query processing. Furthermore; retrieving the top-kresults incurs large communication and processing cost; since partial result lists fromnumerous sites need to be combined and ranked to assembly the top-k answers. To addressboth of these issues; we present an approach for approximate XPath processing overdistributed collections of XML data based on a clustered path index; where data is groupedbased on structural information.

Context aware query processing in Ad-Hoc environments of peers,P Vassiliadis; N Folinas; E Pitoura; E Papapetrou; A Zarras,In this article; we deal with context-aware query processing in ad-hoc peer-to-peer networks.Each peer in such an environment has a database over which users execute queries. Thisdatabase involves (a) relations which are locally stored and (b) virtual relations; all thetuples of which are collected from peers that are present in the network at the time when aquery is posed. The objective of our work is to perform query processing in such anenvironment and; to this end; we start with a formal definition of the system model. Next; weformally define SQLP; an extension of SQL that covers the termination of queries; the failureof individual peers and the semantic characteristics of the peers of such a network.Moreover; we present a query execution algorithm as well as the formal definition of all theoperators that take place in a query execution plan.,*,2008,*

In this paper; we assume that aservice provider has several servers over which web service operations can be deployed.Then; given a workflow of Web services and the topology of the servers; the most efficientmopping of operations to servers must be discovered. Efficiency is measured in terms of twocost functions that concern the execution lime of the workflow and the fairness of the loaddistribution among the servers. We study different topologies for the workflow structure andthe server connectivity and propose a suite of greedy algorithms for each combination.,Data Engineering Workshop; 2007 IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,*

Preference Queries in Context: An Overview,Kostas Stefanidis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panos Vassiliadis,ABSTRACT To handle the overwhelming amount of information currently available;personalization systems allow users to specify the information that interests them throughpreferences. In general; users may have different preferences depending on context; forinstance; on the current weather; time or location. In this paper; we define a model forexpressing contextual preferences. We model context as an ordered set of multidimensionalattributes. Then; user preferences can be specified as functions over these context attributes.We formulate the problem of identifying the preferences that are most relevant to a queryand present an algorithm that locates them. We also introduce index structures that exploitcontextual information for (a) storing preferences and (b) caching the results of queriesbased on their context.,Hellenic Data Management Symposium (HDMS),2006,*
Workload-aware clustering of xml peers,Georgia Koloniari; Evaggelia Pitoura,ABSTRACT Peer-to-peer (p2p) systems are attracting increasing attention as an efficientmeans of sharing data among large; diverse and dynamic sets of users. Clustering in p2psystems aims at improving query processing performance by reducing communication costs;through placing similar data at neighboring peers. In this paper; we present a distributedprocedure for p2p clustering in a system where peers share collections of XML documents.Peer clustering is based on the use of rules that associate the existence of path patterns in apeer's data to its likelihood of belonging to a given cluster. The patterns that form the rulesare selected both from the content of the peers and the query workload of the systemaccording to their popularity. Furthermore; we describe how these rules adapt to reflectchanges in the content of the peers and the local query workload of each cluster.,International Conference on Intelligent Systems And Computing: Theory And Applications,2006,*

04441 Executive Summary-Mobile Information Management.,Margaret H Dunham; Birgitta König-Ries; Evaggelia Pitoura; Peter L Reiher; Can Türker,Abstract From October; 25th until 29th; 2004; a Dagstuhl seminar on mobile informationmanagement took place. The seminar was attended by 34 researchers from Europe andNorth America with backgrounds ranging from database systems; mobile informationsystems; geographic information systems and business informatics to wireless networks andsecurity. The goal of the seminar was to bring together researchers; especially from the areaof databases and information systems; to identify open problems and new challenges indata; service; and user management in mobile information processing environments. We areparticulary interested to provide a forum for discussing the consequences of the mobility ofusers and devices on today's and future data management systems. The first aim of thisdiscussions was to clearly identify these consequences. The second and more …,Mobile Information Management,2004,*

A Peer-to-Реег Aproach to Resource Discovery in Mulit-Agent Systems (extended version),Vassilios V Dimakopoulos; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract In open multi-agent systems; agents need resources provided by other agents; butthey are not aware of which agents provide the particular resources. Most solutions to thisproblem are based on a central directory that maintains a mapping between agents andresources-However; such solutions do not scale well; since the central directory becomes abottleneck in terms of both performance and reliability. In this paper; we introduce a differentapproach: each agent m aiutai us a limited size local cache in which it keeps informationabout к different resources; that isT for each of к resources^ it stores the contact informationof one agent that provides it. This creates a directed network of caches. We address thefollowing fundamental problem: how can an agent that needs a particular resource; find anagent that provides it by navigating tlirough this network of caches. We propose and …,*,2003,*
Data engineering for mobile and wireless access,Panos K Chrysanthis; Vijay Kumar; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Together with wireless communication technologies; portable computers and hand-held devices provide a pervasive base for mobile computing. Mobile computing involvesmobility of users; hardware; software and data. In addition to advances in communicationsand hardware; mobile and wireless access requires innovative theories and paradigms indata management and new data engineering techniques in order to cope with the inherentlimitations of the mobile environment while satisfying the users' new expectations andneeds. This seminar aims at covering such data engineering aspects along twodimensions:(a) the wireless network perspective; and (b) the information processingperspective.

Routing Path Queries in Peer-to-Peer Systems,Georgia Koloniari; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Peer-to-peer systems are gaining popularity as a means to effectively share huge;massively distributed data collections. An important challenge in this context is discoveringthe appropriate data and services. In this paper; we consider peers that store XMLdocuments. We show how an extension of traditional Bloom filters; called multi-level Bloomfilters; can be used to route path queries in such a system. Two alternative ways areconsidered for building overlay networks of peers: one based on network proximity and onebased on content similarity. Content similarity is derived from the similarity among filters. Ourexperimental results show that networks based on content similarity outperform thoseformed based on network proximity for finding all matching documents.,HDMS,2003,*

System-Level Support,Evaggelia Pitoura; George Samaras,Abstract The focus of this chapter is on techniques for providing system-level support formobile operation. In particular; we discuss support for:■ Disconnections: Wirelesscomputers are only intermittently connected to a network. Thus; support for disconnectedoperation—autonomous operation of a mobile host during disconnection—is crucial.■Weak connectivity: Operation should be tuned for communication environmentscharacterized by low bandwidth; high latency; and expensive prices.■ Mobility: Support formobility may be as simple as establishing new communication links or as complicated asmigrating executing processes and database transactions in progress.■ Failure recovery:Since mobile elements are prone to hard failures; methods for failure handling and recoveryare important.,*,1998,*
Software Architectures,Evaggelia Pitoura; George Samaras,Abstract The mobile computing environment is constrained in many ways. Mobile elementsthemselves are resource-poor and unreliable. Their network connectivity is often achievedthrough low-bandwidth wireless links. Furthermore; connectivity is frequently lost for variantperiods of time. The difficulties raised by these constraints are compounded by mobility thatinduces variability in the availability of both communication and computational resources.These severe restrictions have a great impact on the design and structure of mobilecomputing applications and motivate the development of new computing models. Thesemobile computing models must provide efficient access to both existing and newapplications which is a key requirement for the wide acceptance of mobile computing.,*,1998,*
Location Management,Evaggelia Pitoura; George Samaras,Abstract For future Personal Communication Systems (PCSs) with high user populationsand numerous customer services; the signaling and database traffic for locating users isexpected to increase dramatically [172]. Thus; deriving efficient strategies for locationmanagement is an issue central to mobile computing research. PCSs can involve two typesof mobility: terminal and personal mobility [119]. Terminal mobility allows a terminal to beidentified by a unique terminal identifier independent of its point of attachment to thenetwork. Personal mobility allows a PCS user to make and receive calls independently ofboth the network point of attachment and a specific PCS terminal. The presentation in thischapter is applicable to both types of mobility.,*,1998,*
On relaxing serializability by constraining transaction readsets,Evaggelia Pitoura; Aidong Zhang; Bharat Bhargava,Abstract Although; concurrency control in database systems is primarily based onserializability; many recent applications have rendered traditional serializability-basedcriteria inefficient or inappropriate.

Transaction management for mobile heterogeneous computing,Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract Information applications are increasingly required to be distributed amongnumerous remote sites through both wireless and wired links. In this thesis; traditionaltransactions are revised for this new form of distributed computing. A weak consistencymodel is introduced based on extending the database interface with weak operations. Themodel allows disconnected operation and adaptive use of bandwidth. Formal correctnesscriteria for weak database consistency are defined. Conditions on transaction executions aredeveloped and proved to be sufficient for maintaining weak consistency. Graph-based testsand protocols for ensuring this new form of consistency are also presented. An analyticalmodel for a mobile database environment is developed based on coupling data andresource contention. The model is used to measure the performance of the weak …,*,1996,*

A view-based approach to relaxing global serializability in a multidatabase system,Evaggelia Pitoura; Aidong Zhang; Bharat Bhargava,A multidatabase system is a high-level confederation of a number of pre-existing;autonomous and possibly heterogeneous databases. In this environment; transactionmanagement is performed at two levels; at a local level by the transaction managers (LTMs)of the pre-existing databases; and at a global level by a global transaction manager (GTM).There are two types of data; local data that correspond to data that existed prior to theintegration and are related with integrity constraints to data located at the same database;and global data that are created after the integration and may be related with integrityconstraints to local data at the same database or to global data at the same or di erentdatabases. We distinguish two types of transactions; local and global transactions.

Distribution; decentralization and selforganization are the basic underlyingconcepts facilitating these advantages.

Replication Routing Indexes for XML,Panos Skyvalidas; Evaggelia Pitoura; Vassilios V Dimakopoulos; Georgia Koloniari,Abstract. Peer-to-peer systems have attracted considerable attention as a means of sharingcontent among large and dynamic communities of peers. In this paper; we consider sharingof XML documents. We propose a simple yet efficient replication method based onreplication routing indexes. A replication routing index for a peer is a path-based XML. 1 1..E. E 1 E 1 1. 1 E 1 peer. These indexes are used for determining both the granularity of theXML fragments to be replicated as well as appropriate peers for placing the fragments. Wealso present experimental results of the deployment of our indexes in a dynamicunstructured peer-to-peer system.,*,*,*

A Universal and MASIF Compliant Location Management Middleware for Mobile Agents,George Samaras; Constantinos Spyrou; Evaggelia Pitoura; Marios Dikaiakos; Demosthenis Georgiades; Evgenios Charalambous,Abstract This paper presents TRAcKER; a distributed “location management” middlewarewhich has the ability to manage the location of mobile agents that travel autonomously theInternet in search of useful information. Being MASIF compliant and based on pure JAVAallows TRAcKER to be independent of the semantics of the various Java based mobileagent platforms and thus able to serve each one of them seamlessly. Major advantages forthis middleware are the ability (a) to manage the location of any mobile agent and (b) toallow agents to locate other agents; independent of their native execution environment. Themechanism we propose is modular; simple; of low overhead and quite generic able todynamically incorporate various location mechanisms.,*,*,*

However; such searchesmay return an overwhelming number of results. In this paper; we propose personalizing keyworddatabase search by allowing users to express preferences. User preferences depend oncontext. Given the context of a keyword query; the related preferences are selected and usedto rank the results. We present an algorithm for incorporating preferences in computing thetop-k most pertinent to the user results. The algorithm uses the keyword appearances in the preferencesto direct the joining of relevant tuples from multiple relations. We then extend this baseline algorithmto: (i) enhance the diversity of its results and (ii) improve its performance by sharing computationalsteps.

Preference Queries in Context,Kostas Stefanidis; Evaggelia Pitoura; Panos Vassiliadis,ABSTRACT To handle the overwhelming amount of information currently available;personalization systems allow users to specify the information that interests them throughpreferences. In general; users may have different preferences depending on context; forinstance; on the current weather; time or location. In this paper; we define a model forexpressing contextual preferences. We model context as an ordered set of multidimensionalattributes. Then; user preferences can be specified as functions over these context attributes.We formulate the problem of identifying the preferences that are most relevant to a queryand present an algorithm that locates them. We also introduce index structures that exploitcontextual information for (a) storing preferences and (b) caching the results of queriesbased on their context.,*,*,*
A Game Theoretic Approach to the Formation of Clustered Overlay Networks (Extended Version),Georgia Koloniari; Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract In many large-scale content sharing applications; participants or peers are groupedtogether forming clusters based on their content or interests. In this paper; we deal with themaintenance of such clusters in the presence of updates. We model the evolution of thesystem as a game; where peers determine their cluster membership based on a utilityfunction of the query recall. Peers are guided either by selfish or altruistic motives: selfishpeers aim at improving the recall of their own queries; whereas altruistic peers aim atimproving the recall of the queries of other peers. We study the evolution of such clustersboth theoretically and experimentally under a variety of conditions. We show that; in general;local decisions made independently by each peer enable the system to adapt to changesand maintain the overall recall of the query workload.,*,*,*

An importantcomponent of such a complex integrated system is a language that would serve both as adata definition and as a data manipulation tool. Special requirements are posed in theinstance of an integrated system which includes database systems among its components.In this paper; we present the necessary constructs that an object-oriented programminglanguage should provide for being adopted as the language of the integrated system in sucha setting. We adopt a modular; object-based approach to integration. Each component …,*,*,*

ViSMA: Implementation of an Extendible Mobile-Agent Based System for the Materialization and Maintenance of Personalized and Shareable Web Views,George Samaras; Kyriakos Karenos; Panos K Chrysanthis; Evaggelia Pitoura,ABSTRACT ViSMA (Views Supported by Mobile Agents) is an implementation of a flexibleand extendible mobile-agent based system that allows the definition; materialization;maintenance and sharing of distributed views created over remote webaccessibledatabases. The ViSMA architectural components can be distinguished into ViSMA Serverside components; Database side components and Client side components. We haveimplemented three mobile client types based on the user's resource availability andsupporting software. We will demonstrate the functionality of the system includingdatasource definition; shareable and personalized view creation; monitoring; view updatingand deletion. Finally; we will exhibit how view mobility is achieved.,*,*,*

Locating Objects in Mobile Computing* Evaggelia Pitoura Department of Computer Science University of Ioannina GR 45110 Ioannina; Greece,Evaggelia Pitoura,Abstract In current distributed systems; the notion of mobility is emerging in many forms andapplications. Mobility arises naturally in wireless computing; since the location of userschanges as they move. Besides mobility in wireless computing; software mobile agents areanother popular form of moving objects. Locating objects; ie; identifying their currentlocation; is central to mobile computing. In this paper; we present a comprehensive survey ofthe various approaches to the problem of storing; querying; and updating the location ofobjects in mobile computing. The fundamental techniques underlying the proposedapproaches are identified; analyzed and classified along various dimensions.,*,*,*
ReDRIVE: Result-Driven Database Exploration through Recommendations (Extended Version),Marina Drosou; Evaggelia Pitoura,ABSTRACT Typically; users interact with database systems by formulating queries.However; many times users do not have a clear understanding of their information needs orthe exact content of the database; thus; their queries are of an exploratory nature. In thispaper; we propose assisting users in database exploration by recommending to themadditional items that are highly related with the items in the result of their original query.Such items are computed based on the most interesting sets of attribute values (or faSets)that appear in the result of the original user query. The interestingness of a faSet is definedbased on its frequency both in the query result and in the database instance. Databasefrequency estimations rely on a novel approach that employs an ǫ-tolerance closed rarefaSets representation. We report evaluation results of the efficiency and effectiveness of …,*,*,*
