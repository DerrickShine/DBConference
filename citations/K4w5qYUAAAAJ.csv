Graphsig: A scalable approach to mining significant subgraphs in large graph databases,Sayan Ranu; Ambuj K Singh,Graphs are being increasingly used to model a wide range of scientific data. Suchwidespread usage of graphs has generated considerable interest in mining patterns fromgraph databases. While an array of techniques exists to mine frequent patterns; we still lacka scalable approach to mine statistically significant patterns; specifically patterns with low p-values; that occur at low frequencies. We propose a highly scalable technique; calledGraphSig; to mine significant subgraphs from large graph databases. We convert eachgraph into a set of feature vectors where each vector represents a region within the graph.Domain knowledge is used to select a meaningful feature set. Prior probabilities of featuresare computed empirically to evaluate statistical significance of patterns in the feature space.Following analysis in the feature space; only a small portion of the exponential search …,Data Engineering; 2009.

Recommendations to boost content spread in social networks,Vineet Chaoji; Sayan Ranu; Rajeev Rastogi; Rushi Bhatt,Abstract Content sharing in social networks is a powerful mechanism for discovering contenton the Internet. The degree to which content is disseminated within the network depends onthe connectivity relationships among network nodes. Existing schemes for recommendingconnections in social networks are based on the number of common neighbors; similarity ofuser profiles; etc. However; such similarity-based connections do not consider the amount ofcontent discovered. In this paper; we propose novel algorithms for recommendingconnections that boost content propagation in a social network without compromising on therelevance of the recommendations. Unlike existing work on influence propagation; in ourenvironment; we are looking for edges instead of nodes; with a bound on the number ofincident edges per node. We show that the content spread function is not submodular …,Proceedings of the 21st international conference on World Wide Web,2012,72
Graph querying; graph motif mining and the discovery of clusters,*,A method for analyzing; querying; and mining graph databases using subgraph andsimilarity querying. An index structure; known as a closure tree; is defined for topologicalsummarization of a set of graphs. In addition; a significance model is created in which thegraphs are transformed into histograms of primitive components. Finally; connectedsubstructures or clusters; comprising paths or trees; are detected in networks found in thegraph databases using a random walk technique and a repeated random walk technique.,*,2011,41
Mining statistically significant molecular substructures for efficient molecular classification,Sayan Ranu; Ambuj K Singh,The increased availability of large repositories of chemical compounds has created newchallenges in designing efficient molecular querying and mining systems. Molecularclassification is an important problem in drug development where libraries of chemicalcompounds are screened and molecules with the highest probability of success against agiven target are selected. We have developed a technique called GraphSig to minesignificantly over-represented molecular substructures in a given class of molecules.GraphSig successfully overcomes the scalability bottleneck of mining patterns at a lowfrequency. Patterns mined by GraphSig display correlation with biological activities andserve as an excellent platform on which to build molecular analysis tools.

Answering top-k representative queries on graph databases,Sayan Ranu; Minh Hoang; Ambuj Singh,Abstract Given a function that classifies a data object as relevant or irrelevant; we considerthe task of selecting k objects that best represent all relevant objects in the underlyingdatabase. This problem occurs naturally when analysts want to familiarize themselves withthe relevant objects in a database using a small set of k exemplars. In this paper; we solvethe problem of top-k representative queries on graph databases. While graph databasesmodel a wide range of scientific data; solving the problem in the context of graphs presentsus with unique challenges due to the inherent complexity of matching structures.Furthermore; top-k representative queries map to the classic Set Cover problem; making itNP-hard. To overcome these challenges; we develop a greedy approximation withtheoretical guarantees on the quality of the answer set; noting that a better approximation …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,17
Indexing and matching trajectories under inconsistent sampling rates,Sayan Ranu; P Deepak; Aditya D Telang; Prasad Deshpande; Sriram Raghavan,Quantifying the similarity between two trajectories is a fundamental operation in analysis ofspatio-temporal databases. While a number of distance functions exist; the recent shift in thedynamics of the trajectory generation procedure violates one of their core assumptions; aconsistent and uniform sampling rate. In this paper; we formulate a robust distance functioncalled Edit Distance with Projections (EDwP) to match trajectories under inconsistent andvariable sampling rates through dynamic interpolation. This is achieved by deploying theidea of projections that goes beyond matching only the sampled points while aligningtrajectories. To enable efficient trajectory retrievals using EDwP; we design an indexstructure called TrajTree. TrajTree derives its pruning power by employing the uniquecombination of bounding boxes with Lipschitz embedding.

Further; asubset of edges is determined from the samples of edges based on gain corresponding toeach edge. Also; each node of the subset of edges is having at least one of less than 'K'orequal to 'K'incoming edges. Further; the probability of each edge; of the subset of edges;may be incremented. Furthermore; a final set of edges may be determined by ensuring'K'incoming edges.

Debunking the myths of influence maximization: An in-depth benchmarking study,Akhil Arora; Sainyam Galhotra; Sayan Ranu,Abstract Influence maximization (IM) on social networks is one of the most active areas ofresearch in computer science. While various IM techniques proposed over the last decadehave definitely enriched the field; unfortunately; experimental reports on existing techniquesfall short in validity and integrity since many comparisons are not based on a commonplatform or merely discussed in theory. In this paper; we perform an in-depth benchmarkingstudy of IM techniques on social networks. Specifically; we design a benchmarking platform;which enables us to evaluate and compare the existing techniques systematically andthoroughly under identical experimental conditions. Our benchmarking results analyze anddiagnose the inherent deficiencies of the existing approaches and surface the openchallenges in IM even after a decade of research.

Inferring uncertain trajectories from partial observations,Prithu Banerjee; Sayan Ranu; Sriram Raghavan,The explosion in the availability of GPS-enabled devices has resulted in an abundance oftrajectory data. In reality; however; majority of these trajectories are collected at a lowsampling rate and only provide partial observations on their actually traversed routes.Consequently; they are mired with uncertainty. In this paper; we develop a technique calledInfer Tra to infer uncertain trajectories from network-constrained partial observations. Ratherthan predicting the most likely route; the inferred uncertain trajectory takes the form of anedge-weighted graph and summarizes all probable routes in a holistic manner. Fortrajectory inference; Infer Tra employs Gibbs sampling by learning a Network Mobility Model(NMM) from a database of historical trajectories. Extensive experiments on real trajectorydatabases show that the graph-based approach of Infer Tra is up to 50% more accurate …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2014 IEEE International Conference on,2014,14
Mining discriminative subgraphs from global-state networks,Sayan Ranu; Minh Hoang; Ambuj Singh,Abstract Global-state networks provide a powerful mechanism to model the increasingheterogeneity in data generated by current systems. Such a network comprises of a series ofnetwork snapshots with dynamic local states at nodes; and a global network state indicatingthe occurrence of an event. Mining discriminative subgraphs from global-state networksallows us to identify the influential sub-networks that have maximum impact on the globalstate and unearth the complex relationships between the local entities of a network and theircollective behavior. In this paper; we explore this problem and design a technique calledMINDS to mine minimally discriminative subgraphs from large global-state networks. Tocombat the exponential subgraph search space; we derive the concept of an edit map andperform Metropolis Hastings sampling on it to compute the answer set.

Probabilistic Substructure Mining From Small‐Molecule Screens,Sayan Ranu; Bradley T Calhoun; Ambuj K Singh; S Joshua Swamidass,Abstract Identifying the overrepresented substructures from a set of molecules with similaractivity is a common task in chemical informatics. Existing substructure miners aredeterministic; requiring the activity of all mined molecules to be known with high confidence.In contrast; we introduce pGraphSig; a probabilistic structure miner; which effectively minesstructures from noisy data; where many molecules are labeled with their probability of beingactive. We benchmark pGraphSig on data from several small-molecule high throughputscreens; finding that it can more effectively identify overrepresented structures than adeterministic structure miner.,Molecular Informatics,2011,13
Answering top-k queries over a mixture of attractive and repulsive dimensions,Sayan Ranu; Ambuj K Singh,Abstract In this paper; we formulate a top-k query that compares objects in a database to auser-provided query object on a novel scoring function. The proposed scoring functioncombines the idea of attractive and repulsive dimensions into a general framework toovercome the weakness of traditional distance or similarity measures. We study theproperties of the proposed class of scoring functions and develop efficient and scalableindex structures that index the isolines of the function. We demonstrate various scenarioswhere the query finds application. Empirical evaluation demonstrates a performance gain ofone to two orders of magnitude on querying time over existing state-of-the-art top-ktechniques. Further; a qualitative analysis is performed on a real dataset to highlight thepotential of the proposed query in discovering hidden data characteristics.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,12
Commit: A scalable approach to mining communication motifs from dynamic networks,Saket Gurukar; Sayan Ranu; Balaraman Ravindran,Abstract A fundamental problem in behavioral analysis of human interactions is tounderstand how communications unfold. In this paper; we study this problem by miningCommunication motifs from dynamic interaction networks. A communication motif is arecurring subgraph that has a similar sequence of information flow. Mining communicationmotifs requires us to explore the exponential subgraph search space where existingtechniques fail to scale. To tackle this scalability bottleneck; we develop a technique calledCOMMIT. COMMIT converts a dynamic graph into a database of sequences. Through carefulanalysis in the sequence space; only a small portion of the exponential search space isaccessed to identify regions embedding communication motifs. Extensive experiments onthree different social networks show COMMIT to be up to two orders of magnitude faster …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,11

The primary goal in analysis of molecular databases is toidentify structural patterns that can predict biological activity. Two of the most popularapproaches to representing molecular topologies are graphs and 3D geometries. As aresult; the problem of indexing and mining structural patterns map to indexing and miningpatterns from graph and 3D geometric databases. In this tutorial; we will first introduce theproblem of drug discovery and how computer science plays a critical role in that process. Wewill then proceed by introducing the problem of performing subgraph and similarity searcheson large graph databases.

As cellular networks embrace heterogeneous technologies (including long range3G/4G and short range WiFi; Femto-cells; etc.); most traffic generated by static users getsabsorbed by the short-range technologies; thereby increasingly leaving mobile user traffic tomacro-cells. To this end; we consider a novel approach that factors in the trajectories ofmobile users as well as the impact of city geographies and their associated road networksfor macro-cell planning. Given a budget k of base-stations that can be upgraded; ourapproach selects a deployment that improves the most number of user trajectories.

People In Motion: Spatio-temporal Analytics on Call Detail Records,Vinay Kolar; Sayan Ranu; Anand Prabhu Subramainan; Yedendra Shrinivasan; Aditya Telang; Ravi Kokku; Sriram Raghavan,The data about how people move in a city can be potentially used by various enterprisesand government organizations to strategically optimize their operations and maximize theirrevenue. However; fine-grained and real-time data is currently unavailable to theenterprises. We believe that Cellular Network operators can deliver such data and insightsto enterprises. Call records collected in the networks embed a wealth of information aboutwhere; when and how a large fraction of the city moves.

Novel method for pharmacophore analysis by examining the joint pharmacophore space,Sayan Ranu; Ambuj K Singh,We propose a novel method for pharmacophore analysis by examining the JointPharmacophore Space of chemical compounds; targets; and chemical/biological properties.The proposed approach is a notable deviation from existing techniques that analyzecompounds on a target-by-target basis; aimed at extracting and optimizing a specificpharmacophore. The underlying geometry of the pharmacophores is responsible for bindingbetween compounds and targets as well as properties of compounds such as Blood BrainBarrier permeability.

Entity linking for web search queries,P Deepak; Sayan Ranu; Prithu Banerjee; Sameep Mehta,Abstract We consider the problem of linking web search queries to entities from a knowledgebase such as Wikipedia. Such linking enables converting a user's web search session to afootprint in the knowledge base that could be used to enrich the user profile. Traditionalmethods for entity linking have been directed towards finding entity mentions in textdocuments such as news reports; each of which are possibly linked to multiple entitiesenabling the usage of measures like entity set coherence. Since web search queries arevery small text fragments; such criteria that rely on existence of a multitude of mentions donot work too well on them. We propose a three-phase method for linking web search queriesto wikipedia entities.

Geo-social clustering of places from check-in data,Shivam Srivastava; Shiladitya Pande; Sayan Ranu,In this paper; we develop an algorithm to cluster places not only based on their locations butalso their semantics. Specifically; two places are considered similar if they are spatially closeand visited by people of similar communities. With the explosion in the availability of location-tracking technologies; it has become easy to track locations and movements of usersthrough user" check-ins". These check-ins provide insights into the community structure ofpeople visiting a place; which is leveraged and integrated into the proposed geo-socialclustering framework called GeoScop. While community detection is typically done on socialnetworks; in our problem; we lack any network data. Rather; two people belong to the samecommunity if they visit similar geo-social clusters.

Predicting novel metabolic pathways through subgraph mining,Aravind Sankar; Sayan Ranu; Karthik Raman,Abstract Motivation The ability to predict pathways for biosynthesis of metabolites is veryimportant in metabolic engineering. It is possible to mine the repertoire of biochemicaltransformations from reaction databases; and apply the knowledge to predict reactions tosynthesize new molecules. However; this usually involves a careful understanding of themechanism and the knowledge of the exact bonds being created and broken. There is aneed for a method to rapidly predict reactions for synthesizing new molecules; which reliesonly on the structures of the molecules; without demanding additional information such asthermodynamics or hand-curated reactant mapping; which are often hard to obtainaccurately.

This has been a challenging question to address experimentally as single-molecule studies are constrained by the limited number of observed folding events whileensemble measurements; by definition; report only an average and not the distribution of thequantity under study.

Mantra: a scalable approach to mining temporally anomalous sub-trajectories,Prithu Banerjee; Pranali Yawalkar; Sayan Ranu,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of mining temporally anomalous sub-trajectorypatterns from an input trajectory in a scalable manner. Given the prevailing road conditions;a sub-trajectory is temporally anomalous if its travel time deviates significantly from theexpected time. Mining these patterns requires us to delve into the sub-trajectory space;which is not scalable for real-time analytics. To overcome this scalability challenge; wedesign a technique called MANTRA. We study the properties unique to anomalous sub-trajectories and utilize them in MANTRA to iteratively refine the search space into a disjointset of sub-trajectory islands. The expensive enumeration of all possible sub-trajectories isperformed only on the islands to compute the answer set of maximal anomalous sub-trajectories.

SkyGraph: retrieving regions of interest using skyline subgraph queries,Shiladitya Pande; Sayan Ranu; Arnab Bhattacharya,Abstract Several services today are annotated with points of interest (PoIs) such as" coffeeshop";" park"; etc. A region of interest (RoI) is a neighborhood that contains PoIs relevant tothe user. In this paper; we study the scenario where a user wants to identify the best RoI in acity. The user expresses relevance through a set of keywords denoting PoIs. Ideally; the RoIshould be small enough in size such that the user can conveniently explore the PoIs. On theother hand; it should be as relevant as possible. How does one balance the importance ofsize versus relevance? To a user exploring the RoI on foot; size is more critical. However; fora user equipped with a vehicle; relevance is a more important factor.

Applications of Top-k Representative Queries,Sayan Ranu; Minh Hoang; Ambuj Singh,Abstract Top-k queries find a list of k objects that have the largest scores based on someuser-provided relevance function. In practice; objects in the top-k list are often similar to eachother and are thus informationally redundant. This possibility of information redundancy hasignited much interest in the problem of diversity-aware top-k queries. In diversity-awarequeries; the goal is to maximize the diversity of the answer set; which in turn enhances theoverall information content by representing a wider spectrum of the high scoring objects. Inthis paper; we demonstrate that the information content in the top-k answer set can be furtherenhanced by favoring the representative power of the answer set instead of diversity.,Proceedings of Semantic Web Information Management on Semantic Web Information Management,2014,*

The first solid implementation of a DLP system is called DLV(Datalog with Vel). In this paper we offer three strategies to produce optimal solutions in DLVfor the well-known Bridge Crossing Problem. These strategies are a piggyback strategy; anon-piggyback strategy; and a mixed strategy. An analysis to determine the number of timesteps required for an optimal solution using these strategies is provided. We alsocharacterize and prove the conditions under which a particular strategy should be used toobtain an optimal solution. These strategies are implemented in the form of optimizationrules in a DLV program for the bridge crossing problem. Preliminary results indicate a drasticreduction in execution time when compared to other DLV programs for bridge crossing …,*,2006,*

Mining Significant Chemical Substructures in 2D and 3D Spaces,Sayan Ranu; Ambuj K Singh,Abstract: We present scalable and efficient techniques to mine molecular repositories basedon their representation in the 2D and 3D spaces. Both techniques show immense potentialin molecular classification and activity prediction. Empirical evaluation has confirmed thepotential of these techniques. Increased availability of large repositories of chemicalcompounds has created new challenges and opportunities for the application of data-miningtechniques to problems in chemical informatics. Often chemical compounds are representedas graphs where the nodes represent atoms and the edges represent covalent bondsbetween them. Mining statistically significant subgraphs from such graph databases enableus to isolate over-represented molecular substructures in a database. These over-represented substructures are highly information rich and find application in classification …,*,*,*
Debunking the Myths of Influence Maximization,Akhil Arora; Sainyam Galhotra; Sayan Ranu,ABSTRACT Influence maximization (IM) on social networks is one of the most active areas ofresearch in computer science. While various IM techniques proposed over the last decadehave definitely enriched the field; unfortunately; experimental reports on existing techniquesfall short in validity and integrity since many comparisons are not based on a commonplatform or merely discussed in theory. In this paper; we perform an in-depth benchmarkingstudy of IM techniques on social networks. Specifically; we design a benchmarking platform;which enables us to evaluate and compare the existing techniques systematically andthoroughly under identical experimental conditions. Our benchmarking results analyze anddiagnose the inherent deficiencies of the existing approaches and surface the openchallenges in IM even after a decade of research. More fundamentally; we unearth and …,*,*,*

GCspy for JikesRVM,Vishwakarma Singh; Sayan Ranu,Garbage collection is an automatic mechanism in the implementation of a language forreclaiming memory garbage on behalf of a programmer. That ensures that the programmerdoesn't need to deal with deallocation of memory and it prevents errors like danglingpointers and memory leaks. However; Garbage collectors are very complex. It's hard tocomprehend their complex and sometimes chaotic behavior; as a small change in theprogram can alter its performance. Thus; a tool that helps to track memory usage andvisualize the internal workings of the garbage collectors will be of great help. The GCspyframework lets us visualize the heap. However; we may need detailed information thanwhat's supported by existing GCspy. We extend JikesRVM-GCspy to display moreinformation per tile in the GCspy. Further we also integrate JikesRVM MarkSweep …,*,*,*
CoBRa: Content Based Ranking for Documents,Vishwakarma Singh; Sayan Ranu,ABSTRACT We propose a new self learning model to rank a set of related documents basedon their content. We create a model for each document and learn a parent model. All thedocuments are ranked based on their similarity with the parent model. We use this to re-ranktop-k results generated by a search engine for a key word. It dramatically improves theranking of content rich pages with a very small computation time of 10 ms.,*,*,*
