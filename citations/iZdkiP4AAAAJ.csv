Investigation and Implementation of a Robust Temperature Control Algorithm for Friction Stir Welding,Kenneth A Ross,Abstract In friction stir welding; the temperature of the process zone affects the properties ofthe resulting weld and has a dramatic effect on tool life in PCBN (polycrystalline cubic boronnitride) tools. Therefore an active control system that changes process parameters to controlweld temperature is desirable. Mayfield and Sorensen proposed a two-stage control modelthat contains an inner loop that controls the spindle speed to keep power constant and anouter loop for setting the desired power based on weld temperature. This work contains theanalysis and implementation of a temperature control method based on their work. Thisresearch shows that power input to the stir zone leads tool temperature. Due to the inertiaassociated with the spindle; power control is best achieved by commanding torque ratherthan spindle speed. Heat transfer in the tool and stir zone is explored and analytical …,*,2012,10
Advances in Temperature Control for FSP,Kenneth Ross; Carl Sorensen,Abstract A temperature control algorithm has been developed that contains an inner loop tocontrol power and an outer loop to command power based on temperature feedback. Thefoundation of the control algorithm used in this work is the fact that spindle power leads tooltemperature. This fact will be proven through analytical models and experimental data.Commanding spindle power to control temperature is a significant paradigm shift for somemembers of the friction stir processing (FSP) community. The anticipated benefits oftemperature control during FSP include: decreased variation in properties throughout thelength of the weld; increased repeatability; increased tool life and extension of theapplication of FSP. This paper summarizes previous research; and investigates theoryrelevant to temperature control in FSP. Subsequently; the current state of temperature …,Friction Stir Welding and Processing VII,2013,6
Paradigm Shift in Control of the Spindle Axis,Kenneth Ross; Carl Sorensen,Abstract Previous work has demonstrated the value of a cascaded control loop to control tooltemperature; with an inner high-speed loop controlling spindle power; and an outer; low-speed loop controlling temperature by adjusting the power setpoint. Such control schemeshave demonstrated the ability to control process temperature. Traditional power controlschemes produce a relatively noisy power signal; which potentially decreases the stability ofthe control scheme and leads to unnecessary stress on the FSP tool and equipment.Rethinking the fundamental physics of power control has led to a revised power control loop.The revised loop has much less noise and provides improved temperature control of theprocess. This paper presents the revised power control method; along with the modelsupporting it. It also presents both analytical and experimental demonstration that the …,Friction Stir Welding and Processing VII,2013,5
Investigation of methods to control friction stir weld power with spindle speed changes,Kenneth Ross; Carl Sorensen,Abstract Process zone temperatures in FSW determine the properties of the resulting weldand dramatically affect tool life in PCBN tools. Therefore an active control system to adjustweld temperature is desirable. Spindle power is a key factor in temperature control becauseit is the primary power input to the stir zone. Temperature control is achieved by using anouter control loop to set the desired power based on temperature feedback and an innerloop to adjust spindle speed to achieve the desired power. Torque feedback can be used tochange spindle speed to achieve the desired power. Alternatively a feed forward derivativecontrol model can be used. The two control models and steady state results are presented.Both models adjust power with negligible steady state error and produce temperature trendsindicating the dual loop temperature control system will be successful.,Proceedings of Friction Stir Welding and Processing VI; San Diego; USA,2011,5

Friction Stir Processing of Degraded Austenitic Stainless Steel Nuclear Fuel Dry Cask Storage System Canisters,Ben Sutton; Ken Ross; Glenn Grant; Gary Cannell; Greg Frederick; Robert Couch,Abstract Chloride-induced stress corrosion cracking (CISCC) of austenitic stainless steel drycask storage system (DCSS) canisters has been identified as an industry concern. TypicalDCSS canisters are constructed from Types 304 or 316 stainless steel or their variants viaconventional fusion welding processes. The presence of residual tensile stress and Cr-carbide precipitation within the weld heat affected zone (HAZ) places canisters near salt-bearing environments at an elevated risk for CISCC. The current study evaluates thesuitability of friction stir processing (FSP) to repair stress corrosion cracking (SCC) andremediate sensitized fusion weld HAZs. FSP was applied to furnace sensitized Type 304specimens containing laboratory-generated SCC and evaluated using liquid penetrantinspection; phased array ultrasonic inspection; and optical microscopy.

Solid-State Joining of Thick-Section Dissimilar Materials Using a New Friction Stir Dovetailing (FSD) Process,Md. Reza-E-Rabby; Ken Ross; Scott Whalen; Yuri Hovanski; Martin McDonnell,Abstract Solid-state joining of thick section aluminum to steel plate has been achieved usinga new process called friction stir dovetailing (FSD). In FSD; a custom designed pin tool isused to flow a lower melting point material (AA6061) into dovetail grooves machined into thesurface of an underlying material that has a higher melting point (rolled homogeneous armor[RHA]). Repeating dovetails form a mechanical interlocking structure akin to metallic Velcro.In this study; 38.1 mm (1.5 in.) thick AA6061 was joined to 12.7 mm (0.5 in.) thick RHAplates. The effectiveness of FSD is demonstrated through tensile test data that showsspecimens failing in the processed aluminum rather than at the joint interface. Numericalsimulations that highlight the importance of optimizing dovetail geometry are presented. Theeffect of process parameters on joint strength and microstructure also are discussed.,Friction Stir Welding and Processing IX,2017,1

Joining thick section aluminum to steel with suppressed FeAl intermetallic formation via friction stir dovetailing,Md Reza-E-Rabby; Kenneth Ross; Nicole R. Overman; Matthew J. Olszta; Martin McDonnell; Scott A. Whalen,Abstract A new solid-phase technique called friction stir dovetailing (FSD) has beendeveloped for joining thick section aluminum to steel. In FSD; mechanical interlocks areformed at the aluminum-steel interface and are reinforced by metallurgical bonds whereintermetallic growth has been uniquely suppressed. Lap shear testing shows superiorstrength and extension at failure compared to friction stir approaches where metallurgicalbonding is the only joining mechanism.

Simultaneous Independent Control of Tool Axial Force and Temperature in Friction Stir Processing,Ken Ross; Glenn Grant; Jens Darsell; David Catalini,Abstract Maintaining consistent tool depth relative to the part surface is a critical requirementfor many friction stir processing (FSP) applications. Force control is often used with the goalof obtaining a constant weld depth. When force control is used; if weld temperaturedecreases; flow stress increases and the tool is pushed up. If weld temperature increases;flow stress decreases and the tool dives. These variations in tool depth and weldtemperature cause various types of weld defects. Robust temperature control for FSPmaintains a commanded temperature through control of the spindle axis only. Robusttemperature control and force control are completely decoupled in control logic and machinemotion. This results in stable temperature; force and tool depth despite the presence ofgeometric and thermal disturbances. Performance of this control method is presented for …,Friction Stir Welding and Processing IX,2017,*
