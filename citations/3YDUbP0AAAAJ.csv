Type less; find more: fast autocompletion search with a succinct index,Holger Bast; Ingmar Weber,Abstract We consider the following full-text search autocompletion feature. Imagine a user ofa search engine typing a query. Then with every letter being typed; we would like an instantdisplay of completions of the last query word which would lead to good hits. At the sametime; the best hits for any of these completions should be displayed. Known indexing datastructures that apply to this problem either incur large processing times for a substantialclass of queries; or they use a lot of space. We present a new indexing data structure thatuses no more space than a state-of-the-art compressed inverted index; but with 10 timesfaster query processing times. Even on the large TREC Terabyte collection; which comprisesover 25 million documents; we achieve; on a single machine and with the index on disk;average response times of one tenth of a second. We have built a full-fledged; interactive …,Proceedings of the 29th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2006,213
Personalized; interactive tag recommendation for flickr,Nikhil Garg; Ingmar Weber,Abstract We study the problem of personalized; interactive tag recommendation for Flickr:While a user enters/selects new tags for a particular picture; the system suggests relatedtags to her; based on the tags that she or other people have used in the past along with(some of) the tags already entered. The suggested tags are dynamically updated with everyadditional tag entered/selected. We describe a new algorithm; called Hybrid; which can beapplied to this problem; and show that it outperforms previous algorithms. It has only a singletunable parameter; which we found to be very robust. Apart from this new algorithm and itsdetailed analysis; our main contributions are (i) a clean methodology which leads toconservative performance estimates;(ii) showing how classical classification algorithms canbe applied to this problem;(iii) introducing a new cost measure; which captures the effort …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM conference on Recommender systems,2008,185
Ester: efficient search on text; entities; and relations,Holger Bast; Alexandru Chitea; Fabian Suchanek; Ingmar Weber,Abstract We present ESTER; a modular and highly efficient system for combined full-text andontology search. ESTER builds on a query engine that supports two basic operations: prefixsearch and join. Both of these can be implemented very efficiently with a compact index; yetin combination provide powerful querying capabilities. We show how ESTER can answerbasic SPARQL graph-pattern queries on the ontology by reducing them to a small number ofthese two basic operations. ESTER further supports a natural blend of such semanticqueries with ordinary full-text queries. Moreover; the prefix search operation allows for a fullyinteractive and proactive user interface; which after every keystroke suggests to the userpossible semantic interpretations of his or her query; and speculatively executes the mostlikely of these interpretations. As a proof of concept; we applied ESTER to the English …,Proceedings of the 30th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2007,162
Web search queries can predict stock market volumes,Ilaria Bordino; Stefano Battiston; Guido Caldarelli; Matthieu Cristelli; Antti Ukkonen; Ingmar Weber,We live in a computerized and networked society where many of our actions leave a digitaltrace and affect other people's actions. This has lead to the emergence of a new data-drivenresearch field: mathematical methods of computer science; statistical physics andsociometry provide insights on a wide range of disciplines ranging from social science tohuman mobility. A recent important discovery is that search engine traffic (ie; the number ofrequests submitted by users to search engines on the www) can be used to track and; insome cases; to anticipate the dynamics of social phenomena. Successful examples includeunemployment levels; car and home sales; and epidemics spreading. Few recent worksapplied this approach to stock prices and market sentiment. However; it remains unclear iftrends in financial markets can be anticipated by the collective wisdom of on-line users on …,PloS one,2012,159
The CompleteSearch engine: Interactive; efficient; and towards IR & DB integration,Holger Bast; Ingmar Weber,Zusammenfassung We describe CompleteSearch; an interactive search engine that offersthe user a variety of complex features; which at first glance have little in common; yet are allprovided via one and the same highly optimized core mechanism. This mechanism answersqueries for what we call context-sensitive prefix search and completion: given a set ofdocuments and a word range; compute all words from that range which are contained in oneof the given documents; as well as those of the given documents which contain a word fromthe given range. Among the supported features are:(i) automatic query completion; forexample; find all completions of the prefix “seman” that occur in the context of the word“ontology”; as well as the best hits for any such completion;(ii) semi-structured (XML)retrieval; for example; find all emailmessages with “dbworld” in the subject line;(iii) …,Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR),2007,159
A large-scale sentiment analysis for Yahoo! answers,Onur Kucuktunc; B Barla Cambazoglu; Ingmar Weber; Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu,Abstract Sentiment extraction from online web documents has recently been an activeresearch topic due to its potential use in commercial applications. By sentiment analysis; werefer to the problem of assigning a quantitative positive/negative mood to a short bit of text.Most studies in this area are limited to the identification of sentiments and do not investigatethe interplay between sentiments and other factors. In this work; we use a sentimentextraction tool to investigate the influence of factors such as gender; age; education level;the topic at hand; or even the time of the day on sentiments in the context of a large onlinequestion answering site. We start our analysis by looking at direct correlations; eg; weobserve more positive sentiments on weekends; very neutral ones in the Science &Mathematics topic; a trend for younger people to express stronger sentiments; or people …,Proceedings of the fifth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2012,136
The demographics of web search,Ingmar Weber; Carlos Castillo,Abstract How does the web search behavior of" rich" and" poor" people differ? Do men andwomen tend to click on difffferent results for the same query? What are some queries almostexclusively issued by African Americans? These are some of the questions we address inthis study. Our research combines three data sources: the query log of a major US-basedweb search engine; profile information provided by 28 million of its users (birth year; genderand ZIP code); and US-census information including detailed demographic informationaggregated at the level of ZIP code. Through this combination we can annotate each querywith; eg the average per-capita income in the ZIP code it originated from. Thoughconceptually simple; this combination immediately creates a powerful user modeling tool.,Proceedings of the 33rd international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2010,134
Purely URL-based topic classification,Eda Baykan; Monika Henzinger; Ludmila Marian; Ingmar Weber,Abstract Given only the URL of a web page; can we identify its topic? This is the questionthat we examine in this paper. Usually; web pages are classified using their content; but aURL-only classifier is preferable;(i) when speed is crucial;(ii) to enable content filteringbefore an (objection-able) web page is downloaded;(iii) when a page's content is hidden inimages;(iv) to annotate hyperlinks in a personalized web browser; without fetching the targetpage; and (v) when a focused crawler wants to infer the topic of a target page beforedevoting bandwidth to download it. We apply a machine learning approach to the topicidentification task and evaluate its performance in extensive experiments on categorizedweb pages from the Open Directory Project (ODP). When training separate binary classifiersfor each topic; we achieve typical F-measure values between 80 and 85; and a typical …,Proceedings of the 18th international conference on World wide web,2009,128
You tweet what you eat: Studying food consumption through twitter,Sofiane Abbar; Yelena Mejova; Ingmar Weber,Abstract Food is an integral part of our lives; cultures; and well-being; and is of major interestto public health. The collection of daily nutritional data involves keeping detailed diaries orperiodic surveys and is limited in scope and reach. Alternatively; social media is infamousfor allowing its users to update the world on the minutiae of their daily lives; including theireating habits. In this work we examine the potential of Twitter to provide insight into US-widedietary choices by linking the tweeted dining experiences of 210K users to their interests;demographics; and social networks. We validate our approach by relating the caloric valuesof the foods mentioned in the tweets to the state-wide obesity rates; achieving a Pearsoncorrelation of 0.77 across the 50 US states and the District of Columbia. We then build amodel to predict county-wide obesity and diabetes statistics based on a combination of …,Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2015,92
Who uses web search for what: and how,Ingmar Weber; Alejandro Jaimes,Abstract We analyze a large query log of 2.3 million anonymous registered users from a web-scale US search engine in order to jointly analyze their on-line behavior in terms of who theymight be (demographics); what they search for (query topics); and how they search (sessionanalysis). We examine basic demographics from registration information provided by theusers; augmented with US census data; analyze basic session statistics; classify queries intotypes (navigational; informational; transactional) based on click entropy; classify queries intotopic categories; and cluster users based on the queries they issued. We then examine theresulting clusters in terms of demographics and search behavior. Our analysis of the datasuggests that there are important differences in search behavior across differentdemographic groups in terms of the topics they search for; and how they search (eg; white …,Proceedings of the fourth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2011,92

Who watches (and shares) what on youtube? and when?: using twitter to understand youtube viewership,Adiya Abisheva; Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella; David Garcia; Ingmar Weber,Abstract By combining multiple social media datasets; it is possible to gain insight into eachdataset that goes beyond what could be obtained with either individually. In this paper wecombine user-centric data from Twitter with video-centric data from YouTube to build a richpicture of who watches and shares what on YouTube. We study 87K Twitter users; 5.6million YouTube videos and 15 million video sharing events from user-; video-and sharing-event-centric perspectives. We show that features of Twitter users correlate with YouTubefeatures and sharing-related features. For example; urban users are quicker to share thanrural users. We find a superlinear relationship between initial Twitter shares and the finalamounts of views. We discover that Twitter activity metrics play more role in video popularitythan mere amount of followers. We also reveal the existence of correlated behavior …,Proceedings of the 7th ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2014,53
Inferring international and internal migration patterns from twitter data,Emilio Zagheni; Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella; Ingmar Weber,Abstract Data about migration flows are largely inconsistent across countries; typicallyoutdated; and often inexistent. Despite the importance of migration as a driver ofdemographic change; there is limited availability of migration statistics. Generally;researchers rely on census data to indirectly estimate flows. However; little can be inferredfor specific years between censuses and for recent trends. The increasing availability ofgeolocated data from online sources has opened up new opportunities to track recent trendsin migration patterns and to improve our understanding of the relationships between internaland international migration. In this paper; we use geolocated data for about 500;000 users ofthe social network website" Twitter". The data are for users in OECD countries during theperiod May 2011-April 2013. We evaluated; for the subsample of users who have posted …,Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on World Wide Web,2014,51
An analysis of factors used in search engine ranking,Albert Carles Bifet Figuerol; Carlos Castillo; Paul-Alexandru Chirita; Ingmar Weber,Abstract This paper investigates the influence of different page features on the ranking ofsearch engine results. We use Google (via its API) as our testbed and analyze the resultrankings for several queries of different categories using statistical methods. We reformulatethe problem of learning the underlying; hidden scores as a binary classification problem. Tothis problem we then apply both linear and non-linear methods. In all cases; we split thedata into a training set and a test set to obtain a meaningful; unbiased estimator for thequality of our predictor. Although our results clearly show that the scoring function cannot beapproximated well using only the observed features; we do obtain many interesting insightsalong the way and discuss ways of obtaining a better estimate and main limitations in tryingto do so.,*,2005,50
What and how children search on the web,Sergio Duarte Torres; Ingmar Weber,Abstract The Internet has become an important part of the daily life of children as a source ofinformation and leisure activities. Nonetheless; given that most of the content available onthe web is aimed at the general public; children are constantly exposed to inappropriatecontent; either because the language goes beyond their reading skills; their attention spandiffers from grown-ups or simple because the content is not targeted at children as is thecase of ads and adult content. In this work we employed a large query log sample from acommercial web search engine to identify the struggles and search behavior of children ofthe age of 6 to young adults of the age of 18. Concretely we hypothesized that the large andcomplex volume of information to which children are exposed leads to ill-defined searchesand to disorientation during the search process. For this purpose; we quantified their …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,47
Secular vs. islamist polarization in egypt on twitter,Ingmar Weber; Venkata R Kiran Garimella; Alaa Batayneh,Abstract We use public data from Twitter; both in English and Arabic; to study thephenomenon of secular vs. Islamist polarization in Twitter. Starting with a set of prominentseed Twitter users from both camps; we follow retweeting edges to obtain an extendednetwork of users with inferred political orientation. We present an in-depth description of themembers of the two camps; both in terms of behavior on Twitter and in terms of offlinecharacteristics such as gender. Through the identification of partisan users; we compute avalence on the secular vs. Islamist axis for hashtags and use this information both to analyzetopical interests and to quantify how polarized society as a whole is at a given point in time.For the last 12 months; large values on this" polarization barometer" coincided with periodsof violence.

A comprehensive study of features and algorithms for URL-based topic classification,Eda Baykan; Monika Henzinger; Ludmila Marian; Ingmar Weber,Abstract Given only the URL of a Web page; can we identify its topic? We study this problemin detail by exploring a large number of different feature sets and algorithms on severaldatasets. We also show that the inherent overlap between topics and the sparsity of theinformation in URLs makes this a very challenging problem. Web page classification withouta page's content is desirable when the content is not available at all; when a classification isneeded before obtaining the content; or when classification speed is of utmost importance.For our experiments we used five different corpora comprising a total of about 3 million(URL; classification) pairs. We evaluated several techniques for feature generation andclassification algorithms. The individual binary classifiers were then combined via boostinginto metabinary classifiers. We achieve typical F-measure values between 80 and 85; and …,ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB),2011,46
# foodporn: Obesity patterns in culinary interactions,Yelena Mejova; Hamed Haddadi; Anastasios Noulas; Ingmar Weber,Abstract We present a large-scale analysis of Instagram pictures taken at 164;753restaurants by millions of users. Motivated by the obesity epidemic in the United States; ouraim is three-fold:(i) to assess the relationship between fast food and chain restaurants andobesity;(ii) to better understand people's thoughts on and perceptions of their daily diningexperiences; and (iii) to reveal the nature of social reinforcement and approval in the contextof dietary health on social media. When we correlate the prominence of fast food restaurantsin US counties with obesity; we find the Foursquare data to show a greater correlation at0.424 than official survey data from the County Health Rankings would show. Our analysisfurther reveals a relationship between small businesses and local foods with better dietaryhealth; with such restaurants getting more attention in areas of lower obesity.

Content and network dynamics behind Egyptian political polarization on Twitter,Javier Borge-Holthoefer; Walid Magdy; Kareem Darwish; Ingmar Weber,Abstract There is little doubt about whether social networks play a role in modern protests.This agreement has triggered an entire research avenue; in which social structure andcontent analysis have been central-but are typically exploited separately. Here; we combinethese two approaches to shed light on the opinion evolution dynamics in Egypt during thesummer of 2013 along two axes (Islamist/Secularist; pro/anti-military intervention). We intendto find traces of opinion changes in Egypt's population; paralleling those in the internationalcommunity-which oscillated from sympathetic to condemnatory as civil clashes grew. Wefind little evidence of people" switching" sides but observe clear changes in volume withboth pro-and anti-military camps becoming more active at different stages.,Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing,2015,44

You are where you e-mail: using e-mail data to estimate international migration rates,Emilio Zagheni; Ingmar Weber,Abstract International migration is one of the major determinants of demographic change.Although efforts to produce comparable statistics are underway; estimates of demographicflows are inexistent; outdated; or largely inconsistent; for most countries. We estimate ageand gender-specific migration rates using data extracted from a large sample of Yahoo! e-mail messages. Self-reported age and gender of anonymized e-mail users were linked tothe geographic locations (mapped from IP addresses) from where users sent e-mailmessages over time (2009-2011). The users' country of residence over time was inferred asthe one from where most e-mail messages were sent. Our estimates of age profiles ofmigration are qualitatively consistent with existing administrative data sources.

Personalized tag suggestion for flickr,Nikhil Garg; Ingmar Weber,Abstract We present a system for personalized tag suggestion for Flickr: While the user isentering/selecting new tags for a particular picture; the system is suggesting related tags toher; based on the tags that she or other people have used in the past along with (some of)the tags already entered. The suggested tags are dynamically updated with every additionaltag entered/selected. We describe three algorithms which can be applied to this problem. Inexperiments; our best-performing method yields an improvement in precision of 10-15%over a baseline method very similar to the system currently used by Flickr. Our system isaccessible at http://ltaa5. epfl. ch/flickr-tags/.

Efficient interactive query expansion with complete search,Holger Bast; Debapriyo Majumdar; Ingmar Weber,Abstract We present an efficient realization of the following interactive search engine feature:as the user is typing the query; words that are related to the last query word and that wouldlead to good hits are suggested; as well as selected such hits. The realization has threeparts:(i) building clusters of related terms;(ii) adding this information as artificial words to theindex such that (iii) the described feature reduces to an instance of prefix search andcompletion. An efficient solution for the latter is provided by the CompleteSearch engine;with which we have integrated the proposed feature. For building the clusters of relatedterms we propose a variant of latent semantic indexing that; unlike standard approaches; iscompletely transparent to the user. By experiments on two large test-collections; wedemonstrate that the feature is provided at only a slight increase in query processing time …,Proceedings of the sixteenth ACM conference on Conference on information and knowledge management,2007,44
# FailedRevolutions: Using Twitter to study the antecedents of ISIS support,Walid Magdy; Kareem Darwish; Ingmar Weber,Abstract: Within a fairly short amount of time; the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) hasmanaged to put large swaths of land in Syria and Iraq under their control. To manyobservers; the sheer speed at which this" state" was established was dumbfounding. Tobetter understand the roots of this organization and its supporters we present a study usingdata from Twitter. We start by collecting large amounts of Arabic tweets referring to ISIS andclassify them into pro-ISIS and anti-ISIS. This classification turns out to be easily done simplyusing the name variants used to refer to the organization: the full name and the descriptionas" state" is associated with support; whereas abbreviations usually indicate opposition. Wethen" go back in time" by analyzing the historic timelines of both users supporting andopposing and look at their pre-ISIS period to gain insights into the antecedents of support …,First Monday,2016,42
Web page language identification based on URLs,Eda Baykan; Monika Henzinger; Ingmar Weber,Abstract Given only the URL of a web page; can we identify its language? This is thequestion that we examine in this paper. Such a language classifier is; for example; useful forcrawlers of web search engines; which frequently try to satisfy certain language quotas.

With URL-based languageclassifiers these redundant downloads can be avoided.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,42
Mining web query logs to analyze political issues,Ingmar Weber; Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella; Erik Borra,Abstract We present a novel approach to using anonymized web search query logs toanalyze and visualize political issues. Our starting point is a list of politically annotated blogs(left vs. right). We use this list to assign a numerical political leaning to queries leading toclicks on these blogs. Furthermore; we map queries to Wikipedia articles and to fact-checkedstatements from politifact. com; as well as applying sentiment analysis to search results. Withthis rich; multi-faceted data set we obtain novel graphical visualizations of issues anddiscover connections between the different variables. Our findings include (i) an interest in"the other side" where queries about Democrat politicians have a right leaning and viceversa;(ii) evidence that" lies are catchy" and that queries pertaining to false statements aremore likely to attract large volumes; and (iii) the observation that the more right-leaning a …,Proceedings of the 4th Annual ACM Web Science Conference,2012,37

The stability of the h-index,Monika Henzinger; Jacob Suñol; Ingmar Weber,Abstract Over the last years the h-index has gained popularity as a measure for comparingthe impact of scientists. We investigate if ranking according to the h-index is stable withrespect to (i) different choices of citation databases;(ii) normalizing citation counts by thenumber of authors or by removing self-citations;(iii) small amounts of noise created byrandomly removing citations or publications and (iv) small changes in the definition of theindex. In experiments for 5;283 computer scientists and 1;354 physicists we show thatalthough the ranking of the h-index is stable under most of these changes; it is unstablewhen different databases are used. Therefore; comparisons based on the h-index shouldonly be trusted when the rankings of multiple citation databases agree.,Scientometrics,2010,33

Analysis of search and browsing behavior of young users on the web,Sergio Duarte Torres; Ingmar Weber; Djoerd Hiemstra,Abstract The Internet is increasingly used by young children for all kinds of purposes.Nonetheless; there are not many resources especially designed for children on the Internetand most of the content online is designed for grown-up users. This situation is problematic ifwe consider the large differences between young users and adults since their topic interests;computer skills; and language capabilities evolve rapidly during childhood. There is littleresearch aimed at exploring and measuring the difficulties that children encounter on theInternet when searching for information and browsing for content. In the first part of this work;we employed query logs from a commercial search engine to quantify the difficulties childrenof different ages encounter on the Internet and to characterize the topics that they search for.We employed query metrics (eg; the fraction of queries posed in natural language) …,ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB),2014,30
Gender asymmetries in reality and fiction: The bechdel test of social media,David Garcia; Ingmar Weber; Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella,Abstract The subjective nature of gender inequality motivates the analysis and comparisonof data from real and fictional human interaction. We present a computational extension ofthe Bechdel test: A popular tool to assess if a movie contains a male gender bias; by lookingfor two female characters who discuss about something besides a man. We provide the toolsto quantify Bechdel scores for both genders; and we measure them in movie scripts andlarge datasets of dialogues between users of MySpace and Twitter. Comparing movies andusers of social media; we find that movies and Twitter conversations have a consistent malebias; which does not appear when analyzing MySpace. Furthermore; the narrative of Twitteris closer to the movies that do not pass the Bechdel test than to those that pass it. We link theproperties of movies and the users that share trailers of those movies. Our analysis …,International Conference on Weblogs and Social Media (ICWSM),2014,30
Answers; not links: extracting tips from yahoo! answers to address how-to web queries,Ingmar Weber; Antti Ukkonen; Aris Gionis,Abstract We investigate the problem of mining" tips" from Yahoo! Answers and displayingthose tips in response to related web queries. Here; a" tip" is a short; concrete and self-contained bit of non-obvious advice such as" To zest a lime if you don't have a zester: use acheese grater." First; we estimate the volume of web queries with" how-to" intent; whichcould be potentially addressed by a tip. Second; we analyze how to detect such queriesautomatically without solely relying on literal" how to*" patterns. Third; we describe how toderive potential tips automatically from Yahoo! Answers; and we develop machine-learningtechniques to remove low-quality tips. Finally; we discuss how to match web queries with"how-to" intent to tips. We evaluate both the quality of these direct displays as well as the sizeof the query volume that can be addressed by serving tips.,Proceedings of the fifth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining,2012,30
An expressive mechanism for auctions on the web,Paul Dütting; Monika Henzinger; Ingmar Weber,Abstract Auctions are widely used on the Web. Applications range from internet advertisingto platforms such as eBay. In most of these applications the auctions in use are single/multi-item auctions with unit demand. The main drawback of standard mechanisms for this type ofauctions; such as VCG and GSP; is the limited expressiveness that they offer to the bidders.The General Auction Mechanism (GAM) of [1] is taking a first step towards addressing theproblem of limited expressiveness by computing a bidder optimal; envy free outcome forlinear utility functions with identical slopes and a single discontinuity per bidder-item pair.We show that in many practical situations this does not suffice to adequately model thepreferences of the bidders; and we overcome this problem by presenting the first mechanismfor piece-wise linear utility functions with non-identical slopes and multiple discontinuities …,Proceedings of the 20th international conference on World wide web,2011,30

Automated Hate Speech Detection and the Problem of Offensive Language,Thomas Davidson; Dana Warmsley; Michael Macy; Ingmar Weber,Abstract: A key challenge for automatic hate-speech detection on social media is theseparation of hate speech from other instances of offensive language. Lexical detectionmethods tend to have low precision because they classify all messages containing particularterms as hate speech and previous work using supervised learning has failed to distinguishbetween the two categories. We used a crowd-sourced hate speech lexicon to collect tweetscontaining hate speech keywords. We use crowd-sourcing to label a sample of these tweetsinto three categories: those containing hate speech; only offensive language; and those withneither. We train a multi-class classifier to distinguish between these different categories.Close analysis of the predictions and the errors shows when we can reliably separate hatespeech from other offensive language and when this differentiation is more difficult.

Sociolinguistic analysis of Twitter in multilingual societies,Suin Kim; Ingmar Weber; Li Wei; Alice Oh,Abstract In a multilingual society; language not only reflects culture and heritage; but alsohas implications for social status and the degree of integration in society. Differentlanguages can be a barrier between monolingual communities; and the dynamics oflanguage choice could explain the prosperity or demise of local languages in aninternational setting. We study this interplay of language and network structure in diverse;multi-lingual societies; using Twitter. In our analysis; we are particularly interested in the roleof bilinguals. Concretely; we attempt to quantify the degree to which users are the" bridge-builders" between monolingual language groups; while monolingual users cluster together.Also; with the revalidation of English as a lingua franca on Twitter; we reveal users of thenative non-English language have higher influence than English users; and the language …,Proceedings of the 25th ACM conference on Hypertext and social media,2014,23
Political hashtag trends,Ingmar Weber; Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella; Asmelash Teka,Abstract Political Hashtag Trends (PHT) is an analysis tool for political left-vs.-rightpolarization of Twitter hashtags. PHT computes a leaning for trending; political hashtags in agiven week; giving insights into the polarizing US American issues on Twitter. The leaning ofa hashtag is derived in two steps. First; users retweeting a set of “seed users” with a knownpolitical leaning; such as Barack Obama or Mitt Romney; are identified and thecorresponding leaning is assigned to retweeters.

Is Twitter a public sphere for online conflicts? A cross-ideological and cross-hierarchical look,Zhe Liu; Ingmar Weber,Abstract The rise in popularity of Twitter has led to a debate on its impact on public opinions.The optimists foresee an increase in online participation and democratization due to socialmedia's personal and interactive nature. Cyber-pessimists; on the other hand; explain howsocial media can lead to selective exposure and can be used as a disguise for those inpower to disseminate biased information. To investigate this debate empirically; we evaluateTwitter as a public sphere using four metrics: equality; diversity; reciprocity and quality.Using these measurements; we analyze the communication patterns between individuals ofdifferent hierarchical levels and ideologies. We do this within the context of three diverseconflicts: Israel-Palestine; US Democrats-Republicans; and FC Barcelona-Real Madrid. Inall cases; we collect data around a central pair of Twitter accounts representing the two …,International Conference on Social Informatics,2014,22
Get Back! You Don't Know Me Like That: The Social Mediation of Fact Checking Interventions in Twitter Conversations.,Aniko Hannak; Drew Margolin; Brian Keegan; Ingmar Weber,Abstract The prevalence of misinformation within social media and online communities canundermine public security and distract attention from important issues. Fact-checkinginterventions; in which users cite fact-checking websites such as Snopes. com andFactCheck. org; are a strategy users can employ to refute false claims made by their peers.While laboratory research suggests such interventions are not effective in persuadingpeople to abandon false ideas; little work considers how such interventions are actuallydeployed in real-world conversations. Using approximately 1;600 interventions observed onTwitter between 2012 and 2013; we examine the contexts and consequences of fact-checking interventions. We focus in particular on the social relationship between theindividual who issues the fact-check and the individual whose facts are challenged. Our …,ICWSM,2014,22
Analyzing the Targets of Hate in Online Social Media,Leandro Silva; Mainack Mondal; Denzil Correa; Fabrício Benevenuto; Ingmar Weber,Abstract Social media systems allow Internet users a congenial platform to freely expresstheir thoughts and opinions. Although this property represents incredible and uniquecommunication opportunities; it also brings along important challenges. Online hate speechis an archetypal example of such challenges. Despite its magnitude and scale; there is asignificant gap in understanding the nature of hate speech on social media. In this paper; weprovide the first of a kind systematic large scale measurement study of the main targets ofhate speech in online social media. To do that; we gather traces from two social mediasystems: Whisper and Twitter. We then develop and validate a methodology to identify hatespeech on both these systems. Our results identify online hate speech forms and offer abroader understanding of the phenomenon; providing directions for prevention and …,International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM),2016,21
Diversifying user comments on news articles,Giorgos Giannopoulos; Ingmar Weber; Alejandro Jaimes; Timos Sellis,Abstract In this paper we present an approach for diversifying user comments on newsarticles. In our proposed framework; we analyse user comments wrt four different criteria inorder to extract the respective diversification dimensions in the form of feature vectors. Thesecriteria involve content similarity; sentiment expressed within comments; article's namedentities also found within comments and commenting behavior of the respective users. Then;we apply diversification on comments; utilizing the extracted features vectors. The outcomeof this process is a subset of the initial comments that contains heterogeneous comments;representing different aspects of the news article; different sentiments expressed; as well asdifferent user categories; wrt their commenting behavior. We perform a preliminaryqualitative analysis showing that the diversity criteria we introduce result in distinctively …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2012,21
Political Insights: Exploring partisanship in Web search queries,Erik Borra; Ingmar Weber,Abstract We developed Political Insights; an online searchable database of politicallycharged queries; which allows you to obtain topical insights into partisan concern. In thispaper we demonstrate how you can discover such political queries and how to lay barewhich issues are most salient to political audiences. We employ anonymized search enginequeries resulting in a click on US political blogs to calculate the probability that a query willland on blogs of a particular leaning. We are thus able to 'charge'queries politically and togroup them along opposing partisan lines. Finally; by comparing the zip codes of userssubmitting these queries with election results; we find that the leaning of blogs people readcorrelates well with their likely voting behavior.,First Monday,2012,21
Output-sensitive autocompletion search,Holger Bast; Christian W Mortensen; Ingmar Weber,Abstract We consider the following autocompletion search scenario: imagine a user of asearch engine typing a query; then with every keystroke display those completions of the lastquery word that would lead to the best hits; and also display the best such hits. The followingproblem is at the core of this feature: for a fixed document collection; given a set D ofdocuments; and an alphabetical range W of words; compute the set of all word-in-documentpairs (w; d) from the collection such that w∈ W and d∈ D. We present a new data structurewith the help of which such autocompletion queries can be processed; on the average; intime linear in the input plus output size; independent of the size of the underlying documentcollection. At the same time; our data structure uses no more space than an inverted index.Actual query processing times on a large test collection correlate almost perfectly with our …,Information Retrieval,2008,21
Characterizing the demographics behind the# blacklivesmatter movement,Alexandra Olteanu; Ingmar Weber; Daniel Gatica-Perez,Abstract The debates on minority issues are often dominated by or held among theconcerned minorities: gender equality debates have often failed to engage men; while thoseabout race fail to engage the dominant group. To test this observation; we study the#BlackLivesMatter movement and hashtag on Twitter—that has emerged and gained tractionafter a series of events typically involving the death of African-Americans as a result of policebrutality—aiming to quantify the population biases across user types (individuals vs.organizations); and (for individuals) across 3 demographics factors (race; gender and age).Our results suggest that more African-Americans engage with the hashtag; and that they arealso more active than other demographic groups. We also discuss ethical caveats withbroader implications for studies on sensitive topics (eg mental health or religion) that …,Observational Studies through Social Media and Other Human-Generated Content (OSSM),2016,19
From “I love you babe” to “leave me alone”-Romantic Relationship Breakups on Twitter,Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella; Ingmar Weber; Sonya Dal Cin,Abstract We use public data from Twitter to study the breakups of the romantic relationshipsof 661 couples. Couples are identified through profile references such as@ user1 writing “@user2 is the best boyfriend ever!!”. Using this data set we find evidence for a number ofexisting hypotheses describing psychological processes including (i) pre-relationshipcloseness being indicative of post-relationship closeness;(ii)“stonewalling”; ie; ignoringmessages by a partner; being indicative of a pending breakup; and (iii) post-breakupdepression. We also observe a previously undocumented phenomenon of “batch un-friending and being un-friended” where users who break up experience sudden drops of 15-20 followers and friends. Our work shows that public Twitter data can be used to gain newinsights into psychological processes surrounding relationship dissolutions; something …,International Conference on Social Informatics,2014,19
Learning to question: leveraging user preferences for shopping advice,Mahashweta Das; Gianmarco De Francisci Morales; Aristides Gionis; Ingmar Weber,Abstract We present ShoppingAdvisor; a novel recommender system that helps users inshopping for technical products. ShoppingAdvisor leverages both user preferences andtechnical product attributes in order to generate its suggestions. The system elicits userpreferences via a tree-shaped flowchart; where each node is a question to the user. At eachnode; ShoppingAdvisor suggests a ranking of products matching the preferences of theuser; and that gets progressively refined along the path from the tree's root to one of its leafs.In this paper we show (i) how to learn the structure of the tree; ie; which questions to ask ateach node; and (ii) how to produce a suitable ranking at each node. First; we adapt theclassical top-down strategy for building decision trees in order to find the best user attributeto ask at each node. Differently from decision trees; ShoppingAdvisor partitions the user …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,19

The mesh of civilizations in the global network of digital communication,Patrick Park; Ingmar Weber; Michael Macy,Conflicts fueled by popular religious mobilization have rekindled the controversysurrounding Samuel Huntington's theory of changing international alignments in the Post-Cold War era. In The Clash of Civilizations; Huntington challenged Fukuyama's “end ofhistory” thesis that liberal democracy had emerged victorious out of Post-war ideological andeconomic rivalries. Based on a top-down analysis of the alignments of nation states;Huntington famously concluded that the axes of international geo-political conflicts hadreverted to the ancient cultural divisions that had characterized most of human history. Untilrecently; however; the debate has had to rely more on polemics than empirical evidence.Moreover; Huntington made this prediction in 1993; before social media connected theworld's population.

When you’re lost for words: Faceted search with autocompletion,Holger Bast; Ingmar Weber,ABSTRACT In this paper; we show how the autocompletion data structure of [2] can be usedto answer faceted-search queries efficiently. Specifically; we have built a fully-functionalbrowserbased search engine that can index collections with arbitrary category informationand that; after each keystroke from the user; computes and displays the followinginformation:(i) words or phrases that begin with the last query word and would lead to goodhits;(ii) the most relevant categories for those hits;(iii) any category names that match thequery as typed so far;(iv) the most relevant hits for the query as typed so far. By appropriatelyrewriting the faceted-search queries as autocompletion queries according to [2]; we obtainvery fast query processing times; improving those obtained by standard approaches by anorder of magnitude.

You Are What Apps You Use: Demographic Prediction Based on User's Apps,Eric Malmi; Ingmar Weber,Abstract Understanding the demographics of app users is crucial; for example; for appdevelopers; who wish to target their advertisements more effectively. Our work addressesthis need by studying the predictability of user demographics based on the list of a user'sapps which is readily available to many app developers. We extend previous work on theproblem on three frontiers:(1) We predict new demographics (age; race; and income) andanalyze the most informative apps for four demographic attributes included in our analysis.The most predictable attribute is gender (82.3% accuracy); whereas the hardest to predict isincome (60.3% accuracy).(2) We compare several dimensionality reduction methods forhigh-dimensional app data; finding out that an unsupervised method yields superior resultscompared to aggregating the apps at the app category level; but the best results are …,International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM),2016,15
Persistent sharing of fitness app status on twitter,Kunwoo Park; Ingmar Weber; Meeyoung Cha; Chul Lee,Abstract As the world becomes more digitized and interconnected; information that was onceconsidered to be private such as oneâ s health status is now being shared publicly. Tounderstand this new phenomenon better; it is crucial to study what types of healthinformation are being shared on social media and why; as well as by whom. In this paper;we study the traits of users who share their personal health and fitness related informationon social media by analyzing fitness status updates that MyFitnessPal users have shared viaTwitter. We investigate how certain features like user profile; fitness activity; and fitnessnetwork in social media can potentially impact the long-term engagement of fitness appusers. We also discuss implications of our findings to achieve a better retention of theseusers and to promote more sharing of their status updates.,ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing (CSCW),2016,15
Piggybacking on social networks,Aristides Gionis; Flavio Junqueira; Vincent Leroy; Marco Serafini; Ingmar Weber,Abstract The popularity of social-networking sites has increased rapidly over the lastdecade. A basic functionalities of social-networking sites is to present users with streams ofevents shared by their friends. At a systems level; materialized per-user views are a commonway to assemble and deliver such event streams on-line and with low latency. Access to thedata stores; which keep the user views; is a major bottleneck of social-networking systems.We propose to improve the throughput of these systems by using social piggybacking; whichconsists of processing the requests of two friends by querying and updating the view of athird common friend. By using one such hub view; the system can serve requests of the firstfriend without querying or updating the view of the second. We show that; given a socialgraph; social piggybacking can minimize the overall number of requests; but computing …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,15
International gender differences and gaps in online social networks,Gabriel Magno; Ingmar Weber,Abstract Article 1 of the United Nations Charter claims “human rights” and “fundamentalfreedoms”“without distinction as to [...] sex”. Yet in 1995 the Human Development Reportcame to the sobering conclusion that “in no society do women enjoy the same opportunitiesas men”. Today; gender disparities remain a global issue and addressing them is a toppriority for organizations such as the United Nations Population Fund. To track progress inthis matter and to observe the effect of new policies; the World Economic Forum annuallypublishes its Global Gender Gap Report. This report is based on a number of offlinevariables such as the ratio of female-to-male earned income or the percentage of women inexecutive office over the last 50 years. In this paper; we use large amounts of network datafrom Google+ to study gender differences in 73 countries and to link online indicators of …,International Conference on Social Informatics,2014,14
Inferring audience partisanship for youtube videos,Ingmar Weber; Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella; Erik Borra,Abstract Political campaigning and the corresponding advertisement money are increasinglymoving online. Some analysts claim that the US~ elections were partly won through a smartuse of (i) targeted advertising and (ii) social media. But what type of information dopoliticized users consume online? And; the other way around; for a given content; eg aYouTube video; is it possible to predict its political audience? To address this latter question;we present a large scale study of anonymous YouTube video consumption of politicizedusers; where political orientation is derived from visits to" beacon pages"; namely; politicalpartisan blogs. Though our techniques are relevant for targeted political advertising; webelieve that our findings are also of a wider interest.,Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web,2013,14
Query recommendation for children,Sergio Duarte Torres; Djoerd Hiemstra; Ingmar Weber; Pavel Serdyukov,Abstract One of the biggest problems that children experience while searching the weboccurs during the query formulation process. Children have been found to struggleformulating queries based on keywords given their limited vocabulary and their difficulty tochoose the right keywords. In this work we propose a method that utilizes tags from socialmedia to suggest queries related to children topics. Concretely we propose a simple yeteffective approach to bias a random walk defined on a bipartite graph of web resources andtags through keywords that are more commonly used to describe resources for children.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,14
Learning cross-modal embeddings for cooking recipes and food images,Amaia Salvador; Nicholas Hynes; Yusuf Aytar; Javier Marin; Ferda Ofli; Ingmar Weber; Antonio Torralba,Abstract In this paper; we introduce Recipe1M; a new large-scale; structured corpus of over1m cooking recipes and 800k food images. As the largest publicly available collection ofrecipe data; Recipe1M affords the ability to train high-capacity models on aligned; multi-modal data. Using these data; we train a neural network to find a joint embedding of recipesand images that yields impressive results on an image-recipe retrieval task. Additionally; wedemonstrate that regularization via the addition of a high-level classification objective bothimproves retrieval performance to rival that of humans and enables semantic vectorarithmetic. We postulate that these embeddings will provide a basis for further exploration ofthe Recipe1M dataset and food and cooking in general. Code; data and models are publiclyavailable 1.,Training,2017,13
Sponsored search; market equilibria; and the Hungarian Method,Paul Dütting; Monika Henzinger; Ingmar Weber,Abstract Matching markets play a prominent role in economic theory. A prime example ofsuch a market is the sponsored search market. Here; as in other markets of that kind; marketequilibria correspond to feasible; envy free; and bidder optimal outcomes. For settingswithout budgets such an outcome always exists and can be computed in polynomial-time bythe so-called Hungarian Method. Moreover; every mechanism that computes such anoutcome is incentive compatible. We show that the Hungarian Method can be modified sothat it finds a feasible; envy free; and bidder optimal outcome for settings with budgets. Wealso show that in settings with budgets no mechanism that computes such an outcome canbe incentive compatible for all inputs. For inputs in general position; however; the presentedmechanism—as any other mechanism that computes such an outcome for settings with …,Information Processing Letters,2013,13
Drawing a data-driven portrait of Wikipedia editors,Robert West; Ingmar Weber; Carlos Castillo,Abstract While there has been a substantial amount of research into the editorial andorganizational processes within Wikipedia; little is known about how Wikipedia editors(Wikipedians) relate to the online world in general. We attempt to shed light on this issue byusing aggregated log data from Yahoo!'s browser toolbar in order to analyze Wikipedians'editing behavior in the context of their online lives beyond Wikipedia. We broadlycharacterize editors by investigating how their online behavior differs from that of otherusers; eg; we find that Wikipedia editors search more; read more news; play more games;and; perhaps surprisingly; are more immersed in popular culture. Then we inspect howeditors' general interests relate to the articles to which they contribute; eg; we confirm theintuition that editors are more familiar with their active domains than average users …,Proceedings of the Eighth Annual International Symposium on Wikis and Open Collaboration,2012,13

Inthis paper we analyze the query log of a large US web search engine to determine whetherthe same queries are performed by different demographic groups at different times;particularly when there are query bursts. We obtain aggregate demographic features fromuser-provided registration information (gender; birth year; ZIP code); US census data; andelection results. Given certain queries; we examine trends (from high to low and vice versa)and changes in the statistical spread of the demographic features of users that issue thequeries over time periods that include query bursts. Our analysis shows that for certain typesof queries (movies and news) distinct demographic groups perform searches at different …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,13
# greysanatomy vs.# yankees: Demographics and Hashtag Use on Twitter,Jisun An; Ingmar Weber,Abstract: Demographics; in particular; gender; age; and race; are a key predictor of humanbehavior. Despite the significant effect that demographics plays; most scientific studies usingonline social media do not consider this factor; mainly due to the lack of such information. Inthis work; we use state-of-the-art face analysis software to infer gender; age; and race fromprofile images of 350K Twitter users from New York. For the period from November 1; 2014to October 31; 2015; we study which hashtags are used by different demographic groups.Though we find considerable overlap for the most popular hashtags; there are also manygroup-specific hashtags.,International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM),2016,12

360-degree quantified self,Hamed Haddadi; Ferda Ofli; Yelena Mejova; Ingmar Weber; Jaideep Srivastava,Wearable devices with a wide range of sensors have contributed to the rise of the QuantifiedSelf movement; where individuals log everything ranging from the number of steps theyhave taken; to their heart rate; to their sleeping patterns. Sensors do not; however; typicallysense the social and ambient environment of the users; such as general life style attributesor information about their social network. This means that the users themselves; and themedical practitioners; privy to the wearable sensor data; only have a narrow view of theindividual; limited mainly to certain aspects of their physical condition. In this paper wedescribe a number of use cases for how social media can be used to complement the check-up data and those from sensors to gain a more holistic view on individuals' health; aperspective we call the 360° Quantified Self.

As more religious leaders andorganizations as well as believers start using social networking sites (eg; Twitter; Facebook);online activities become important extensions to traditional religious rituals and practices.However; there has been lack of research on religiosity in online social networks. This papertakes a step toward the understanding of several important aspects of religiosity on Twitter;based on the analysis of more than 250k US users who self-declared their religions/belief;including Atheism; Buddhism; Christianity; Hinduism; Islam; and Judaism. Specifically;(i) weexamine the correlation of geographic distribution of religious people between Twitter andoffline surveys.(ii) We analyze users' tweets and networks to identify discriminative …,International Conference on Social Informatics,2014,12
Predicting ideological friends and foes in Twitter conflicts,Zhe Liu; Ingmar Weber,Abstract The rise in popularity of Twitter in recent years has in parallel led to an increase inonline controversies. To monitor and control such conflicts early on; we design and evaluatea language-agnostic classifier to tell pairs of ideological friends from foes. We build theclassifier using features from four different aspects: user-based; interaction-based;relationship-based and conflict-based. By experimenting with three large data setscontaining diverse conflicts; we demonstrate the effectiveness of language-agnosticclassification of ideological relation; achieving satisfactory results across all three data sets.Such a classifier potentially enables studies of diverse conflicts on Twitter on a large scale.,Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on World Wide Web,2014,12
A comprehensive study of techniques for URL-based web page language classification,Eda Baykan; Monika Henzinger; Ingmar Weber,Abstract Given only the URL of a Web page; can we identify its language? In this article weexamine this question. URL-based language classification is useful when the content of theWeb page is not available or downloading the content is a waste of bandwidth and time. Webuilt URL-based language classifiers for English; German; French; Spanish; and Italian byapplying a variety of algorithms and features. As algorithms we used machine learningalgorithms which are widely applied for text classification and state-of-art algorithms forlanguage identification of text. As features we used words; various sized n-grams; andcustom-made features (our novel feature set). We compared our approaches with twobaseline methods; namely classification by country code top-level domains andclassification by IP addresses of the hosting Web servers.,ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB),2013,12
A Long-Term Analysis of Polarization on Twitter,Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella; Ingmar Weber,Abstract: Social media has played an important role in shaping political discourse over thelast decade. At the same time; it is often perceived to have increased political polarization;thanks to the scale of discussions and their public nature. In this paper; we try to answer thequestion of whether political polarization in the US on Twitter has increased over the lasteight years. We analyze a large longitudinal Twitter dataset of 679;000 users and look atsigns of polarization in their (i) network-how people follow political and media accounts;(ii)tweeting behavior-whether they retweet content from both sides; and (iii) content-howpartisan the hashtags they use are. Our analysis shows that online polarization has indeedincreased over the past eight years and that; depending on the measure; the relative changeis 10%-20%.

Inferring nationalities of Twitter users and studying inter-national linking,Wenyi Huang; Ingmar Weber; Sarah Vieweg,Abstract Twitter user profiles contain rich information that allows researchers to inferparticular attributes of users' identities. Knowing identity attributes such as gender; age;and/or nationality are a first step in many studies which seek to describe various phenomenarelated to computational social science. Often; it is through such attributes that studies ofsocial media that focus on; for example; the isolation of foreigners; become possible.However; such characteristics are not often clearly stated by Twitter users; so researchersmust turn to other means to ascertain various categories of identity. In this paper; we discussthe challenge of detecting the nationality of Twitter users using rich features from theirprofiles. In addition; we look at the effectiveness of different features as we go about thistask.

Easily-obtainable geolocation data resulting from repeated logins to thesame website offer the possibility of observing long-term patterns of mobility for a largenumber of individuals. We use data on the geographic locations from where over 100 millionanonymized users log into Yahoo!~ services to generate the first global map of short-andmedium-term mobility flows. We develop a protocol to identify anonymized users who; over aone-year period; had spent more than 3 months in a different country from their statedcountry of residence (" migrants"); and users who spent less than a month in another country(" tourists"). We compute aggregate estimates of migration propensities between countries;as inferred from a user's location over the observed period.

Crowdsourcing health labels: Inferring body weight from profile pictures,Ingmar Weber; Yelena Mejova,Abstract To use social media for health-related analysis; one key step is the detection ofhealth-related labels for users. But unlike transient conditions like flu; social media users areless vocal about chronic conditions such as obesity; as users might not tweet``I'm stilloverweight''. As; however; obesity-related conditions such as diabetes; heart disease;osteoarthritis; and even cancer are on the rise; this obese-or-not label could be one of themost useful for studies in public health. In this paper we investigate the feasibility of usingprofile pictures to infer if a user is overweight or not. We show that this is indeed possibleand further show that the fraction of labeled-as-overweight users is higher in US countieswith higher obesity rates. Going from public to individual health analysis; we then finddifferences both in behavior and social networks; for example finding users labeled as …,Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Digital Health Conference,2016,9
Insights from machine-learned diet success prediction,Ingmar Weber; Palakorn Achananuparp,To support people trying to lose weight and stay healthy; more and more fitness apps havesprung up including the ability to track both calories intake and expenditure. Users of suchapps are part of a wider “quantified self” movement and many opt-in to publicly share theirlogged data. In this paper; we use public food diaries of more than 4;000 long-term activeMyFitnessPal users to study the characteristics of a (un-) successful diet. Concretely; wetrain a machine learning model to predict repeatedly being over or under self-set dailycalories goals and then look at which features contribute to the model's prediction. Ourfindings include both expected results; such as the token “mcdonalds” or the category“dessert” being indicative for being over the calories goal; but also less obvious ones suchas the difference between pork and poultry concerning dieting success; or the use of the “ …,Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing,2016,9
Understanding musical diversity via online social media,Minsu Park; Ingmar Weber; Mor Naaman; Sarah Vieweg,Abstract Musicologists and sociologists have long been interested in patterns of musicconsumption and their relation to socioeconomic status. In particular; the Omnivore Thesisexamines the relationship between these variables and the diversity of music a personconsumes. Using data from social media users of Last. fm and Twitter; we design andevaluate a measure that reasonably captures diversity of musical tastes. We use thatmeasure to explore associations between musical diversity and variables that capturesocioeconomic status; demographics; and personal traits such as openness and degree ofinterest in music (into-ness). Our musical diversity measure can provide a useful means forstudies of musical preferences and consumption. Also; our study of the Omnivore Thesisprovides insights that extend previous survey and interview-based studies.,International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM),2016,9
Co-following on Twitter,Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella; Ingmar Weber,Abstract We present an in-depth study of co-following on Twitter based on the observationthat two Twitter users whose followers have similar friends are also similar; even though theymight not share any direct links or a single mutual follower. We show how this observationcontributes to (i) a better understanding of language-agnostic user classification onTwitter;(ii) eliciting opportunities for Computational Social Science; and (iii) improving onlinemarketing by identifying cross-selling opportunities. We start with a machine learningproblem of predicting a user's preference among two alternative choices of Twitter friends.We show that co-following information provides strong signals for diverse classification tasksand that these signals persist even when the most discriminative features are removed.Going beyond mere classification performance optimization; we present applications of …,Proceedings of the 25th ACM conference on Hypertext and social media,2014,9
Query recommendation in the information domain of children,Sergio Duarte Torres; Djoerd Hiemstra; Ingmar Weber; Pavel Serdyukov,Abstract Children represent an increasing group of web users. Some of the key problemsthat hamper their search experience is their limited vocabulary; their difficulty in using theright keywords; and the inappropriateness of their general-purpose query suggestions. Inthis work; we propose a method that uses tags from social media to suggest queries relatedto children's topics. Concretely; we propose a simple yet effective approach to bias a randomwalk defined on a bipartite graph of web resources and tags through keywords that are morecommonly used to describe resources for children. We evaluate our method using a largequery log sample of queries submitted by children. We show that our method outperforms bya large margin the query suggestions of modern search engines and state-of-the art querysuggestions based on random walks. We improve further the quality of the ranking by …,Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology,2014,8
Bidder optimal assignments for general utilities,Paul Dütting; Monika Henzinger; Ingmar Weber,Abstract We study the problem of matching bidders to items where each bidder i hasgeneral; strictly monotonic utility functions ui; j (pj) expressing her utility of being matched toitem j at price pj. For this setting we prove that a bidder optimal outcome always exists; evenwhen the utility functions are non-linear and non-continuous. Furthermore; we give analgorithm to find such a solution. Although the running time of this algorithm is exponential inthe number of items; it is polynomial in the number of bidders.,International Workshop on Internet and Network Economics,2009,8
Semantic full-text search with ESTER: scalable; easy; fast,Holger Bast; Fabian Suchanek; Ingmar Weber,We present a demo of ESTER; a search engine that combines the ease of use; speed andscalability of full-text search with the powerful semantic capabilities of ontologies. ESTERsupports full-text queries; ontological queries and combinations of these; yet its interface isas easy as can be: A standard search field with semantic information provided interactivelyas one types. ESTER works by reducing all queries to two basic operations: prefix searchand join; which can be implemented very efficiently in terms of both processing time andindex space. We demonstrate the capabilities of ESTER on a combination of the EnglishWikipedia with the Yago ontology; with response times below 100 milliseconds for mostqueries; and an index size of about 4 GB. The system can be run both stand-alone and as aWeb application.,Data Mining Workshops; 2008. ICDMW'08. IEEE International Conference on,2008,8
Don’t compare averages,Holger Bast; Ingmar Weber,Abstract We point out that for two sets of measurements; it can happen that the average ofone set is larger than the average of the other set on one scale; but becomes smaller after anon-linear monotone transformation of the individual measurements. We show that theinclusion of error bars is no safeguard against this phenomenon. We give a theorem;however; that limits the amount of “reversal” that can occur; as a by-product we get two non-standard one-sided tail estimates for arbitrary random variables which may be ofindependent interest. Our findings suggest that in the not infrequent situation where morethan one cost measure makes sense; there is no alternative other than to explicitly compareaverages for each of them; much unlike what is common practice.,International Workshop on Experimental and Efficient Algorithms,2005,8
Face-to-bmi: Using computer vision to infer body mass index on social media,Enes Kocabey; Mustafa Camurcu; Ferda Ofli; Yusuf Aytar; Javier Marin; Antonio Torralba; Ingmar Weber,Abstract: A person's weight status can have profound implications on their life; ranging frommental health; to longevity; to financial income. At the societal level;" fat shaming" and otherforms of" sizeism" are a growing concern; while increasing obesity rates are linked to everraising healthcare costs. For these reasons; researchers from a variety of backgrounds areinterested in studying obesity from all angles. To obtain data; traditionally; a person wouldhave to accurately self-report their body-mass index (BMI) or would have to see a doctor tohave it measured. In this paper; we show how computer vision can be used to infer aperson's BMI from social media images. We hope that our tool; which we release; helps toadvance the study of social aspects related to body weight.,ICWSM,2017,7
Algorithms and criteria for diversification of news article comments,Giorgos Giannopoulos; Marios Koniaris; Ingmar Weber; Alejandro Jaimes; Timos Sellis,Abstract In this paper; we introduce an approach for diversifying user comments on newsarticles. We claim that; although content diversity suffices for the keyword search setting; asproven by existing work on search result diversification; it is not enough when it comes todiversifying comments of news articles. Thus; in our proposed framework; we definecomment-specific diversification criteria in order to extract the respective diversificationdimensions in the form of feature vectors. These criteria involve content similarity; sentimentexpressed within comments; named entities; quality of comments and combinations of them.Then; we apply diversification on comments; utilizing the extracted features vectors. Theoutcome of this process is a subset of the initial set that contains heterogeneous comments;representing different aspects of the news article; different sentiments expressed; different …,Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,2015,7
Insights from viewing ranked retrieval as rank aggregation,Holger Bast; Ingmar Weber,We view a variety of established methods for ranked retrieval from a common angle; namelyas a process of combining query-independent rankings that were precomputed for certainattributes. Apart from a general insight into what effectively distinguishes various schemesfrom each other; we obtain three specific results concerned with concept-based retrieval.First; we prove that latent semantic indexing (LSI) can be implemented to answer queries intime proportional to the number of words in the query; which improves over the standardimplementation by an order of magnitude; a similar result is established for LSI'sprobabilistic sibling PLSI. Second; we give a simple and precise characterization of theextent; to which latent semantic indexing (LSI) can deal with polysems; and when it fails todo so. Third; we demonstrate that the recombination of the intricate; yet relatively cheap …,Web Information Retrieval and Integration; 2005. WIRI'05. Proceedings.

Quote rts on twitter: usage of the new feature for political discourse,Kiran Garimella; Ingmar Weber; Munmun De Choudhury,Abstract Social media platforms provide several social interactional features. Due to thelarge scale reach of social media; these interactional features help enable various types ofpolitical discourse. Constructive and diversified discourse is important for sustaining healthycommunities and reducing the impact of echo chambers. In this paper; we empiricallyexamine the role of a newly introduced Twitter feature;'quote retweets'(or'quote RTs') inpolitical discourse; specifically whether it has led to improved; civil; and balanced exchange.Quote RTs allow users to quote the tweet they retweet; while adding a short comment. Ouranalysis using content; network and crowd labeled data indicates that the feature hasincreased political discourse and its diffusion; compared to existing features. We discuss theimplications of our findings in understanding and reducing online polarization.,Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Web Science,2016,6
From Migration Corridors to Clusters: The Value of Google+ Data for Migration Studies,Johnnatan Messias; Fabricio Benevenuto; Ingmar Weber; Emilio Zagheni,Recently; there have been considerable efforts to use online data to investigate internationalmigration. These efforts show that Web data are valuable for estimating migration rates andare relatively easy to obtain. However; existing studies have only investigated flows ofpeople along migration corridors; ie between pairs of countries. In our work; we use dataabout “places lived” from millions of Google+ users in order to study migrationclusters'; iegroups of countries in which individuals have lived sequentially. For the first time; weconsider information about more than two countries people have lived in. We argue thatthese data are very valuable because this type of information is not available in traditionaldemographic sources which record country-to-country migration flows independent of eachother. We show that migration clusters of country triads cannot be identified using …,International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM),2016,6
Whom should we sense in “social sensing”-analyzing which users work best for social media now-casting,Jisun An; Ingmar Weber,Abstract Given the ever increasing amount of publicly available social media data; there isgrowing interest in using online data to study and quantify phenomena in the offline “real”world. As social media data can be obtained in near real-time and at low cost; it is often usedfor “now-casting” indices such as levels of flu activity or unemployment. The term “socialsensing” is often used in this context to describe the idea that users act as “sensors”; publiclyreporting their health status or job losses. Sensor activity during a time period is thentypically aggregated in a “one tweet; one vote” fashion by simply counting. At the same time;researchers readily admit that social media users are not a perfect representation of theactual population. Additionally; users differ in the amount of details of their personal livesthat they reveal. Intuitively; it should be possible to improve now-casting by assigning …,EPJ Data Science,2015,6
Why do you ask this?,Giovanni Gardelli; Ingmar Weber,Abstract We use Yahoo!~ Toolbar data to gain insights into why people use Q&A sites. Forthis purpose we look at tens of thousands of questions asked on both Yahoo!~ Answers andon Wiki Answers. We analyze both the pre-question behavior of users as well as theirgeneral online behavior. Using an existing approach (Harper et al.); we classify questionsinto" informational" vs." conversational". Finally; for a subset of users on Yahoo! Answers wealso integrate age and gender into our analysis. Our results indicate that there is a one-dimensional spectrum of users ranging from" social users" to" informational users". In termsof demographics; we found that both younger and female users are more" social" on thisscale; with older and male users being more" informational".

Sponsored search; market equilibria; and the Hungarian Method,Paul Dütting; Monika Henzinger; Ingmar Weber,Two-sided matching markets play a prominent role in economic theory. A prime example ofsuch a market is the sponsored search market where n advertisers compete for theassignment of one of k sponsored search results; also known as" slots"; for certain keywordsthey are interested in. Here; as in other markets of that kind; market equilibria correspond tostable matchings. In this paper; we show how to modify Kuhn's Hungarian Method (Kuhn;1955) so that it finds an optimal stable matching between advertisers and advertising slots insettings with generalized linear utilities; per-bidder-item reserve prices; and per-bidder-itemmaximum prices. The only algorithm for this problem presented so far (Aggarwal et al.; 2009)requires the market to be in" general position". We do not make this assumption.,27th International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science-STACS 2010,2010,6
Characterizing Awareness of Schizophrenia Among Facebook Users by Leveraging Facebook Advertisement Estimates,Koustuv Saha; Ingmar Weber; Michael L Birnbaum; Munmun De Choudhury,Background Schizophrenia is a rare but devastating condition; affecting about 1% of theworld's population and resulting in about 2% of the US health care expenditure. Majorimpediments to appropriate and timely care include misconceptions; high levels of stigma;and lack of public awareness. Facebook offers novel opportunities to understand publicawareness and information access related to schizophrenia; and thus can complementsurvey-based approaches to assessing awareness that are limited in scale; robustness; andtemporal and demographic granularity. Objective The aims of this study were to (1) constructan index that measured the awareness of different demographic groups aroundschizophrenia-related information on Facebook;(2) study how this index differed acrossdemographic groups and how it correlated with complementary Web-based (Google …,Journal of medical Internet research,2017,5
Is Saki# delicious? The Food Perception Gap on Instagram and Its Relation to Health,Ferda Ofli; Yusuf Aytar; Ingmar Weber; Raggi al Hammouri; Antonio Torralba,Abstract Food is an integral part of our life and what and how much we eat crucially affectsour health. Our food choices largely depend on how we perceive certain characteristics offood; such as whether it is healthy; delicious or if it qualifies as a salad. But theseperceptions differ from person to person and one person's" single lettuce leaf" might beanother person's" side salad". Studying how food is perceived in relation to what it actually istypically involves a laboratory setup. Here we propose to use recent advances in imagerecognition to tackle this problem. Concretely; we use data for 1.9 million images fromInstagram from the US to look at systematic differences in how a machine would objectivelylabel an image compared to how a human subjectively does. We show that this difference;which we call the" perception gap"; relates to a number of health outcomes observed at …,World Wide Web (WWW),2017,5
Visualizing User-Defined; Discriminative Geo-Temporal Twitter Activity.,Ingmar Weber; Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella,Abstract We present a system that visualizes geo-temporal Twitter activity. Thedistinguishing features our system offers include;(i) a large degree of user freedom inspecifying the subset of data to visualize and (ii) a focus on discriminative patterns ratherthan high volume patterns. Tweets with precise GPS co-ordinates are assigned togeographical cells and grouped by (i) tweet language;(ii) tweet topic;(iii) day of week; and(iv) time of day. The spatial resolutions of the cells is determined in a data-driven mannerusing quad-trees and recursive splitting. The user can then choose to see data for; say;English tweets on weekend evenings for the topic “party”. This system has beenimplemented for 1.8 million geo-tagged tweets from Qatar (http://qtr. qcri. org/) and for 4.8million geotagged tweets from New York City (http://nyc. qcri. org/) and can be easily …,ICWSM,2014,5

For this setting we prove that a bidder optimal outcome always exists; evenwhen the utility functions are non-linear and non-continuous. We give sufficient conditionsunder which every mechanism that finds a bidder optimal outcome is incentive compatible.We also give a mechanism that finds a bidder optimal outcome if the conditions for incentivecompatibility are satisfied. The running time of this mechanism is exponential in the numberof items; but polynomial in the number of bidders.,Theoretical Computer Science,2013,5

A data-driven sketch of Wikipedia editors,Robert West; Ingmar Weber; Carlos Castillo,Abstract Who edits Wikipedia? We attempt to shed light on this question by usingaggregated log data from Yahoo!'s browser toolbar in order to analyze Wikipedians' editingbehavior in the context of their online lives beyond Wikipedia. We broadly characterizeeditors by investigating how their online behavior differs from that of other users; eg; we findthat Wikipedia editors search more; read more news; play more games; and; perhapssurprisingly; are more immersed in pop culture. Then we inspect how editors' generalinterests relate to the articles to which they contribute; eg; we confirm the intuition that editorsshow more expertise in their active domains than average users. Our results are relevant asthey illuminate novel aspects of what has become many Web users' prevalent source ofinformation and can help in recruiting new editors.,Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on World Wide Web,2012,5
Leveraging Facebooks Advertising Platform to Monitor Stocks of Migrants,Emilio Zagheni; Ingmar Weber; Krishna Gummadi,GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE of demographic data for monitoring development; the lack ofappropriate sources and indicators for measuring progress toward the achievement oftargets—like the United Nations'“2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”—is asignificant cause of uncertainty. As part of a larger effort to tackle the issue; in 2014 theUnited Nations asked an independent expert advisory group to make recommendations tobring about a data revolution in sustainable development. 1 Data innovation; like new digitaltraces from a variety of technologies; is seen as a significant opportunity to inform policyevaluation and to improve estimates and projections. In this article; we contribute to thedevelopment of tools and methods that leverage new data sources for demographicresearch.

The effect of social feedback in a reddit weight loss community,Tiago Oliveira Cunha; Ingmar Weber; Hamed Haddadi; Gisele L Pappa,Abstract It is generally accepted as common wisdom that receiving social feedback is helpfulto (i) keep an individual engaged with a community and to (ii) facilitate an individual'spositive behavior change. However; quantitative data on the effect of social feedback oncontinued engagement in an online health community is scarce. In this work we applyMahalanobis Distance Matching (MDM) to demonstrate the importance of receivingfeedback in the" loseit" weight loss community on Reddit. Concretely we show that (i) evenwhen correcting for differences in word choice; users receiving more positive feedback ontheir initial post are more likely to return in the future; and that (ii) there are diminishingreturns and social feedback on later posts is less important than for the first post. We alsogive a description of the type of initial posts that are more likely to attract this valuable …,Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Digital Health Conference,2016,4
Bridges into the unknown: Personalizing connections to little-known countries,Yelena Mejova; Javier Borge-Holthoefer; Ingmar Weber,Abstract How are you related to Malawi? Do recent events on the Comoros effect you in anysubtle way? Who in your extended social network is in Croatia? We seldom ask ourselvesthese questions; yet a" long tail" of content beyond our everyday knowledge is waiting to beexplored. In this work we propose a recommendation task of creating interest in little-knowncontent by building personalized" bridges" to users. We consider an example task ofinteresting users in little-known countries; and propose a system which aggregates a user'sTwitter profile; network; and tweets to create an interest model; which is then matched to alibrary of knowledge about the countries.

Using Co-Following for Personalized Out-of-Context Twitter Friend Recommendation.,Ingmar Weber; Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella,Abstract We present two demos that give personalized “out-of-context” recommendations ofTwitter users to follow. By out-of-context we mean that a user wants to receiverecommendation on; say; musicians to follow even though the user's tweets' contents andsocial links have no connection to the “context” of music. In this setting; where a user hasnever expressed interest in the context of music; many existing methods fail. Our approachexploits co-following information and hidden correlations where; say; a user's politicalpreference might actually provide clues about their likely music preference. For example; auser u might be recommended a particular music band b because u also follows a set ofpoliticians P; and other users who follow members of P tend to follow b; rather than analternative b0. We implement this framework in two very distinct settings: one for …,ICWSM,2014,4
PLEAD 2013: politics; elections and data,Ingmar Weber; Ana-Maria Popescu; Marco Pennacchiotti,Abstract What is the role of the internet in politics general and during campaigns inparticular? And what is the role of large amounts of user data in all of this? In the 2008 and2012 US presidential campaigns the Democrats were far more successful than theRepublicans in utilizing online media for mobilization; co-ordination and fundraising. Yearover year; social media and the Internet plays a fundamental role in political campaigns.However; technical research in this area is still limited and fragmented. The goal of thisworkshop is to bring together researchers working at the intersection of social networkanalysis; computational social science and political science; to share and discuss their ideasin a common forum; and to inspire further developments in this growing; fascinating field.,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Conference on information & knowledge management,2013,4
Maximizing revenue from strategic recommendations under decaying trust,Paul Dütting; Monika Henzinger; Ingmar Weber,Abstract Suppose your sole interest in recommending a product to me is to maximize theamount paid to you by the seller for a sequence of recommendations. How should yourecommend optimally if I become more inclined to ignore you with each irrelevantrecommendation you make? Finding an answer to this question is a key challenge in allforms of marketing that rely on and explore social ties; ranging from personalrecommendations to viral marketing. We prove that even if the recommendee regains herinitial trust on each successful recommendation; the expected revenue the recommendercan make over an infinite period due to payments by the seller is bounded. This can only beovercome when the recommendee also incrementally regains trust during periods withoutany recommendation. Here; we see a connection to" banner blindness;" suggesting that …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,4
Efficient index structures for and applications of the CompleteSearch engine,Ingmar Weber,Traditional search engines; such as Google; offer response times well under one second;even for a corpus with more than a billion documents. They achieve this by making use of a(parallelized) inverted index. However; the inverted index is primarily designed to efficientlyprocess simple key word queries; which is why search engines rarely offer support forqueries which cannot be (re-) formulated in this manner; possibly using" special key words';.We have contrived data structures for the CompleteSearch engine; a search engine;developed at the Max-Planck Institute for Computer Science; which supports a far greater setof query types; without sacrificing the efficiency. It is built on top of a context-sensitive prefixsearch and completion mechanism. This mechanism is; on the one hand; simple enough tobe efficiently realized by appropriate algorithms; and; on the other hand; powerful enough …,*,2007,4
Sequences characterizing k-trees,Zvi Lotker; Debapriyo Majumdar; NS Narayanaswamy; Ingmar Weber,Abstract A non-decreasing sequence of n integers is the degree sequence of a 1-tree (ie; anordinary tree) on n vertices if and only if there are least two 1's in the sequence; and the sumof the elements is 2 (n–1). We generalize this result in the following ways. First; a naturalgeneralization of this statement is a necessary condition for k-trees; and we show that it isnot sufficient for any k> 1. Second; we identify non-trivial sufficient conditions for the degreesequences of 2-trees. We also show that these sufficient conditions are almost necessaryusing bounds on the partition function p (n) and probabilistic methods. Third; we generalizethe characterization of degrees of 1-trees in an elegant and counter-intuitive way to yieldinteger sequences that characterize k-trees; for all k.,International Computing and Combinatorics Conference,2006,4
Using Twitter Data to Estimate the Relationship between Short-term Mobility and Long-term Migration,Lee Fiorio; Guy Abel; Jixuan Cai; Emilio Zagheni; Ingmar Weber; Guillermo Vinué,Abstract Migration estimates are sensitive to definitions of time interval and duration. Forexample; when does a tourist become a migrant? As a result; harmonizing across differentkinds of estimates or data sources can be difficult. Moreover in countries like the UnitedStates; that do not have a national registry system; estimates of internal migration typicallyrely on survey data that can require over a year from data collection to publication. Inaddition; each survey can ask only a limited set questions about migration (eg; where didyou live a year ago? where did you live five years ago?). We leverage a sample of geo-referenced Twitter tweets for about 62;000 users; spanning the period between 2010 and2016; to estimate a series of US internal migration flows under varying time intervals anddurations.

Based on work on hate speech; cyberbullying; and onlineabuse we propose a typology that captures central similarities and differences betweensubtasks and we discuss its implications for data annotation and feature construction. Weemphasize the practical actions that can be taken by researchers to best approach theirabusive language detection subtask of interest.,ACL Workshop on Abusive Language,2017,3
A large-scale study of online shopping behavior,Soroosh Nalchigar; Ingmar Weber; Parisa Lak; Ayse Bener,Abstract The continuous growth of e-commerce has stimulated great interest in generatingtheories and models for online consumer behavior. While studies on online consumerbehavior are widespread; research on relating Internet browsing activities to onlineshopping behavior are scarce. This paper provides an exploratory analysis on therelationship between online browsing habits and consumers' pre-shopping effort; as one ofthe indicators of shopping behavior. The data used in this study was extracted from 88;637users with more than half a million shopping instances from two large online retailers;Amazon and Walmart. Our findings provide insights for scholars to form hypotheses anddesign models or theories to explain online consumer behavior. Practitioners may also usethe results of this study to make strategic decisions.,Proceedings of the 20th International Database Engineering & Applications Symposium,2016,3
Extracting Food Substitutes From Food Diary via Distributional Similarity,Palakorn Achananuparp; Ingmar Weber,Abstract: In this paper; we explore the problem of identifying substitute relationship betweenfood pairs from real-world food consumption data as the first step towards the healthier foodrecommendation. Our method is inspired by the distributional hypothesis in linguistics.Specifically; we assume that foods that are consumed in similar contexts are more likely tobe similar dietarily. For example; a turkey sandwich can be considered a suitable substitutefor a chicken sandwich if both tend to be consumed with french fries and salad. To evaluateour method; we constructed a real-world food consumption dataset from MyFitnessPal'spublic food diary entries and obtained ground-truth human judgements of food substitutesfrom a crowdsourcing service. The experiment results suggest the effectiveness of themethod in identifying suitable substitutes.,HealthRecSys,2016,3
Camera brand congruence and camera model propagation in the Flickr social graph,Adish Singla; Ingmar Weber,Abstract Given that my friends on Flickr use cameras of brand X; am I more likely to also usea camera of brand X? Given that one of these friends changes her brand; am I likely to dothe same? Do new camera models pop up uniformly in the friendship graph? Or do earlyadopters then “convert” their friends? Which factors influence the conversion probability of auser? These are the kind of questions addressed in this work. Direct applications involvepersonalized advertising in social networks. For our study; we crawled a completeconnected component of the Flickr friendship graph with a total of 67M edges and 3.9 Musers. 1.2 M of these users had at least one public photograph with valid model metadata;which allowed us to assign camera brands and models to users and time slots.

Offline file assignments for online load balancing,Paul Dütting; Monika Henzinger; Ingmar Weber,Abstract We study a novel load balancing problem that arises in web search engines. Theproblem is a combination of an offline assignment problem; where files need to be (copiedand) assigned to machines; and an online load balancing problem; where requests ask forspecific files and need to be assigned to a corresponding machine; whose load is increasedby this. We present simple deterministic algorithms for this problem and exhibit aninteresting trade-off between the available space to make file copies and the obtainablemakespan. We also give non-trivial lower bounds for a large class of deterministicalgorithms and present a randomized algorithm that beats these bounds with highprobability.,Information Processing Letters,2011,3
Tagging and navigability,Adish Singla; Ingmar Weber,Abstract We consider the problem of optimal tagging for navigational purposes in one's owncollection. What is the best that a forgetful user can hope for in terms of ease of retrieving alabeled object? We prove that the number of tags has to increase logarithmically in thecollection size to maintain a manageable result set. Using Flickr data we then show thatusers do indeed apply more and more tags as their collection grows and that this is not dueto a global increase in tagging activity. However; as the additional terms applied are notstatistically independent; users of large collections still have to deal with larger and largerresult sets; even when more tags are used as search terms. We pose optimal tag suggestionfor navigational purposes as an open problem.,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,3
How much is your personal recommendation worth?,Paul Dütting; Monika Henzinger; Ingmar Weber,Abstract Suppose you buy a new laptop and; simply because you like it so much; yourecommend it to friends; encouraging them to purchase it as well. What would be anadequate price for the vendor of the laptop to pay for your recommendation? Personalrecommendations like this are of considerable commercial interest; but unlike in sponsoredsearch auctions there can be no truthful prices. Despite this" lack of truthfulness" the vendorof the product might still decide to pay you for recommendation eg because she wants to (i)provide you with an additional incentive to actually recommend her or to (ii) increase yoursatisfaction and/or brand loyalty. This leads us to investigate a pricing scheme based on theShapley value [5] that satisfies certain" axioms of fairness".

The aimof this study was to assess knowledge about this new public health threat to personsresiding in a Middle Eastern country. We conducted a survey at several internationaluniversities in Qatar to assess knowledge and awareness about this disease. An adaptedversion of the survey was also conducted using online channels from Qatar. The medianage of the 446 participants; was 25 years; 280 (63%) were females; and 32% were from GulfCooperation Council (GCC) or other Middle East countries. Based upon their knowledgeabout availability of a vaccine; role of mosquitoes and other modes of transmission; anddisease complications; we classified respondent's knowledge as “poor”(66%);“basic”(27 …,BMC infectious diseases,2017,2
Fertility and its Meaning: Evidence from Search Behavior,Jussi Ojala; Emilio Zagheni; Francesco C Billari; Ingmar Weber,Abstract: Fertility choices are linked to the different preferences and constraints of individualsand couples; and vary importantly by socio-economic status; as well by cultural andinstitutional context. The meaning of childbearing and child-rearing; therefore; differsbetween individuals and across groups. In this paper; we combine data from GoogleCorrelate and Google Trends for the US with ground truth data from the AmericanCommunity Survey to derive new insights into fertility and its meaning. First; we show thatGoogle Correlate can be used to illustrate socio-economic differences on the circumstancesaround pregnancy and birth: eg; searches for" flying while pregnant" are linked to highincome fertility; and" paternity test" are linked to non-marital fertility. Second; we combineseveral search queries to build predictive models of regional variation in fertility …,ICWSM,2017,2
Computational Approaches Toward Integrating Quantified Self Sensing and Social Media,Munmun De Choudhury; Mrinal Kumar; Ingmar Weber,Abstract The growing amount of data collected by quantified self tools and social media holdgreat potential for applications in personalized medicine. Whereas the first includes health-related physiological signals; the latter provides insights into a user's behavior. However; thetwo sources of data have largely been studied in isolation. We analyze public data fromusers who have chosen to connect their MyFitnessPal and Twitter accounts. We show that auser's diet compliance success; measured via their self-logged food diaries; can bepredicted using features derived from social media: linguistic; activity; and social capital. Wefind that users with more positive affect and a larger social network are more successful insucceeding in their dietary goals.

The Road to Popularity: The Dilution of Growing Audience on Twitter,Przemyslaw A Grabowicz; Mahmoudreza Babaei; Juhi Kulshrestha; Ingmar W Weber,Abstract On social media platforms; like Twitter; users are often interested in gaining moreinfluence and popularity by growing their set of followers; aka their audience. Severalstudies have described the properties of users on Twitter based on static snapshots of theirfollower network. Other studies have analyzed the general process of link formation. Here;rather than investigating the dynamics of this process itself; we study how the characteristicsof the audience and follower links change as the audience of a user grows in size on theroad to user's popularity. To begin with; we find that the early followers tend to be more eliteusers than the late followers; ie; they are more likely to have verified and expert accounts.Moreover; the early followers are significantly more similar to the person that they follow thanthe late followers. Namely; they are more likely to share time zone; language; and topics …,International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM),2016,2
I like ISIS; but I want to watch Chris Nolan's new movie: Exploring ISIS Supporters on Twitter,Walid Magdy; Kareem Darwish; Ingmar Weber,Abstract The recent rise of the" Islamic State of Iraq and Syria"(ISIS) has sparked significantinterest in the group. We explored the tweets of a large number of Twitter users whofrequently comment on this subject by either showing support or opposition. ISIS supportersdedicate on average 20% of their tweets to ISIS related content; compared to 4.5% for thosewho oppose ISIS. Thus; the vast majority of tweets for both groups are on general topics;covering many aspects in life; including politics; religion; and even jokes and funny photos.Our demo allows users to search and explore 123 million tweets of 57 thousands Twitterusers who have declared explicit positions towards ISIS. Given a query; our system displaysa comparative report that shows the difference in views between supporters and opponentsof ISIS on the search topic.

Quantifying politics using online data: Introduction,Yelena Mejova; Ingmar Weber,Large web-based data sets make possible political studies at a scale inconceivable just adecade ago. Everything from personal opinions to popular political movements leaves afootprint online and provides a firsthand account of both everyday and historic events. Thesedata are; however; unstructured and full of noise requiring new approaches—quantitativemethods developed in the realms of political and social science; but also in data analysisand mining. Applied to online data; these make possible language modeling; topic tracking;novelty detection; social network mining; and many more types of analyses; all providingnew insights into social and political realities. The works compiled below are a sample ofapproaches to quantify political phenomena using online data. All articles underwent a peer-review process by experts from both computer science and/or political/social science. The …,Social Science Computer Review,2014,2
Information retrieval for children: search behavior and solutions,Sergio Duarte Torres,Abstract Nowadays; children of very young ages and teenagers use the Internet extensivelyfor entertainment and educational purposes. The number of active young users in theInternet is increasing everyday as the Internet is more accessible at home; schools and evenon a mobile basis through cellphones and tablets. The most popular search engines aredesigned for adults and they do not provide customize tools for young users. Given thatyoung and adult users have different interests and search strategies; research aimed atunderstanding the activities that young users carried out on the Internet; the way the searchfor information; and the difficulties that they encounter with state-of-the-art search engines;are urgently needed. The first contribution of this thesis addresses these research aims byproviding a characterization; on a large scale; of the search behavior of young users. The …,*,2014,2
Rethinking email message and people search,Sebastian Michel; Ingmar Weber,Abstract We show how a number of novel email search features can be implemented withoutany kind of natural language processing (NLP) or advanced data mining. Our approachinspects the email headers of all messages a user has ever sent or received and it createssimple per-contact summaries; including simple information about the message exchangehistory; the domain of the sender or even the sender's gender. With these summariesadvanced questions/tasks such as" Who do I still need to reply to?" or" Find'fun'messagessent by friends." become possible. As a proof of concept; we implemented a Mozilla-Thunderbird extension; adding powerful people search to the popular email client.,Proceedings of the 18th international conference on World wide web,2009,2

We combined CompleteSearch with ourinstitute's helpdesk system and carried out a small user study with some of the staffoperating the helpdesk. Participants were asked to process ten typical helpdesk requests;alternatingly using CompleteSearch and the off-the-shelf Google Desktop Search. Allparticipants preferred CompleteSearch over Google Desktop; mainly because of its speed;the feeling of being in power; and the enhanced search facilities.,4th Conference on Professional Knowledge Management,2007,2
Who watches (and shares) what on YouTube,Adiya Abisheva; VRK Garimella; David Garcia; Ingmar Weber,ABSTRACT We combine user-centric data from Twitter with video-centric data from YouTubeto analyze who watches and shares what on YouTube. The combination of these data sets1; with around 87k Twitter users; 5.6 million YouTube videos and 15 million video sharingevents; allows rich analysis that goes beyond what could be obtained with either of the twodata sets individually. For Twitter; we generate user features that relate to (i) activity;(ii)interests; and (iii) demographics. For YouTube; we obtain video features for (i) the topic;(ii)the popularity; and (iii) the polarization. These two feature sets are then combined throughsharing events for YouTube URLs on Twitter. This combination is done both in a user-centric; a video-centric and a sharing-event-centric manner. For the user-centric analysis; weshow how Twitter user features correlate both with YouTube features and with sharing …,And when,*,2
Implementing 360° Quantified Self for childhood obesity: feasibility study and experiences from a weight loss camp in Qatar,Luis Fernandez-Luque; Meghna Singh; Ferda Ofli; Yelena A Mejova; Ingmar Weber; Michael Aupetit; Sahar Karim Jreige; Ahmed Elmagarmid; Jaideep Srivastava; Mohamed Ahmedna,The explosion of consumer electronics and social media are facilitating the rise of theQuantified Self (QS) movement where millions of users are tracking various aspects of theirdaily life using social media; mobile technology; and wearable devices. Data from mobilephones; wearables and social media can facilitate a better understanding of the healthbehaviors of individuals. At the same time; there is an unprecedented increase in childhoodobesity rates worldwide. This is a cause for grave concern due to its potential long-termhealth consequences (eg; diabetes or cardiovascular diseases). Childhood obesity is highlyprevalent in Qatar and the Gulf Region. In this study we examine the feasibility of capturingquantified-self data from social media; wearables and mobiles within a weight lost camp foroverweight children in Qatar.

Political Fact-Checking on Twitter: When Do Corrections Have an Effect?,Drew B Margolin; Aniko Hannak; Ingmar Weber,Research suggests that fact checking corrections have only a limited impact on the spread offalse rumors. However; research has not considered that fact-checking may be sociallycontingent; meaning there are social contexts in which truth may be more or less preferred.In particular; we argue that strong social connections between fact-checkers and rumorspreaders encourage the latter to prefer sharing accurate information; making them morelikely to accept corrections. We test this argument on real corrections made on Twitterbetween Janurary 2012 and April; 2014. As hypothesized; we find that individuals whofollow and are followed by the people who correct them are significantly more likely toaccept the correction than individuals confronted by strangers. We then replicate ourfindings on new data drawn from November 2015 to February; 2016. These findings …,Political Communication,2017,1
A Warm Welcome Matters! The Link Between Social Feedback and Weight Loss in/r/loseit,Tiago O Cunha; Ingmar Weber; Gisele L Pappa,Abstract Social feedback has long been recognized as an important element of successfulhealth-related behavior change. How-ever; most of the existing studies look at the effect thatoffline social feedback has. This paper fills gaps in the literature by proposing a framework tostudy the causal effect that receiving social support in the form of comments in an onlineweight loss community has on (i) the probability of the user to return to the forum; and; moreimportantly; on (ii) the weight loss reported by the user. Using a matching approach forcausal inference we observe a difference of 9 lbs lost between users who do or do notreceive comments. Surprisingly; this effect is mediated by neither an increase in lifetime inthe community nor by an increased activity level of the user. Our results show the importancethat a" warm welcome" has when using online support forums to achieve health outcomes.,World Wide Web (WWW),2017,1

Using Facebook Ads Audiences for Global Lifestyle Disease Surveillance: Promises and Limitations,Matheus Araujo; Yelena Mejova; Ingmar Weber; Fabricio Benevenuto,Abstract Every day; millions of users reveal their interests on Facebook; which are thenmonetized via targeted advertisement marketing campaigns. In this paper; we explore theuse of demographically rich Facebook Ads audience estimates for tracking non-communicable diseases around the world. Across 47 countries; we compute the audiencesof marker interests; and evaluate their potential in tracking health conditions associated withtobacco use; obesity; and diabetes; compared to the performance of placebo interests.Despite its huge potential; we find that; for modeling prevalence of health conditions acrosscountries; differences in these interest audiences are only weakly indicative of thecorresponding prevalence rates. Within the countries; however; our approach providesinteresting insights on trends of health awareness across demographic groups. Finally …,ACM WebScience,2017,1
# Sleep_as_Android: Feasibility of Using Sleep Logs on Twitter for Sleep Studies,Fatema Akbar; Ingmar Weber,Social media enjoys a growing popularity as a platform to seek and share personal healthinformation. For sleep studies using data from social media; most researchers focused oninferring sleep-related artifacts from self-reported anecdotal pointers to sleep patterns orissues such as insomnia. The data shared by" quantified-selfers" on social media presentsan opportunity to study more quantitative and objective measures of sleep. We propose andvalidate the approach of collecting and analyzing sleep logs that are generated and sharedthrough a sleep-tracking mobile application. We highlight the value of this data by combiningit with users' social media data. The results provide a validation of using social media forsleep studies as the collected sleep data is aligned with sleep data from other sources. Theresults of combining social media data with sleep data provide preliminary evidence that …,IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI),2016,1

The social name-letter effect on online social networks,Farshad Kooti; Gabriel Magno; Ingmar Weber,Abstract The Name-Letter Effect states that people have a preference for brands; places; andeven jobs that start with the same letter as their own first name. So Sam might like Snickersand live in Seattle. We use social network data from Twitter and Google+ to replicate thiseffect in a new environment. We find limited to no support for the Name-Letter Effect onsocial networks. We do; however; find a very robust Same-Name Effect where; say; Michaelswould be more likely to link to other Michaels than Johns. This effect persists whenaccounting for gender; nationality; race; and age. The fundamentals behind these effectshave implications beyond psychology as understanding how a positive self-image istransferred to other entities is important in domains ranging from studying homophily topersonalized advertising and to link formation in social networks.,International Conference on Social Informatics,2014,1
Cross-hierarchical communication in Twitter conflicts,Zhe Liu; Ingmar Weber,Abstract Social hierarchy plays an important role in shaping the way individuals interactingwith each other. In this study; we propose three metrics: equality; diversity; and reciprocity toevaluate the social hierarchical differences in cross-ideological communication on Twitter.We do this within the context of three diverse conflicts: Israel-Palestine; US Democrats-Republicans; and FC Barcelona-Real Madrid. In all cases; we collect data around a centralpair of Twitter accounts representing the two main parties. Our results show in a quantitativemanner that social hierarchy can be considered a factor that impacts individual'scommunication in Twitter conflicts. As one of the first literatures in this area; we demonstratesocial hierarchy's effect in online environments.,Proceedings of the 25th ACM conference on Hypertext and social media,2014,1

Political polarization of web search queries and hashtags by Ingmar Weber; with Martin Vesely as coordinator,Ingmar Weber,Abstract What can user-generated online data tell us about political issues and partisanpolitics? How polarized is a web search query such as" climategate 2.0" and can we quantifythe leaning of the hashtag# climatechange? We summarize recent work that studies USpolitics using web search logs and Twitter data from the angle of political left-vs.-rightpolarization. With a simple yet effective methodology we discover a number of interestingfindings. For example; we show a tendency for web search queries with a right leaning tosurface more results with a negative sentiment; and we give a description of politicalhashtag hijacking where one political camp tries to\jam the frequency" of the other one.,ACM SIGWEB Newsletter,2013,1
Using toolbar data to understand Yahoo!: answers usage,Giovanni Gardelli; Ingmar Weber,Abstract We use Yahoo! Toolbar data to gain insights into why people use Q&A sites. Welook at questions asked on Yahoo! Answers and analyze both the pre-question behavior ofusers as well as their general online behavior. Our results indicate that there is a one-dimensional spectrum of users ranging from" social users" to" informational users" and thatweb search and Q&A sites complement each other; rather than compete. Concerning the pre-question behavior; users who first issue a question-related query are more likely to issueinformational questions; rather than conversational ones; and such questions are less likelyto attract an answer. Finally; we only find weak evidence for topical congruence between auser's questions and his web queries.,Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on World Wide Web,2012,1
On the pricing of recommendations and recommending strategically,Paul Dütting; Monika Henzinger; Ingmar Weber,Abstract: If you recommend a product to me and I buy it; how much should you be paid bythe seller? And if your sole interest is to maximize the amount paid to you by the seller for asequence of recommendations; how should you recommend optimally if I become moreinclined to ignore you with each irrelevant recommendation you make? Finding an answerto these questions is a key challenge in all forms of marketing that rely on and explore socialties; ranging from personal recommendations to viral marketing. In the first part of this paper;we show that there can be no pricing mechanism that is" truthful" with respect to the seller;and we use solution concepts from coalitional game theory; namely the Core; the ShapleyValue; and the Nash Bargaining Solution; to derive provably" fair" prices for settings with oneor multiple recommenders. We then investigate pricing mechanisms for the setting where …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0911.1619,2009,1
Studying Migrant Assimilation Through Facebook Interests,Antoine Dubois; Emilio Zagheni; Kiran Garimella; Ingmar Weber,Abstract: Migrants' assimilation is a major challenge for European societies; in part becauseof the sudden surge of refugees in recent years and in part because of long-termdemographic trends. In this paper; we use Facebook's data for advertisers to study the levelsof assimilation of Arabic-speaking migrants in Germany; as seen through the interests theyexpress online. Our results indicate a gradient of assimilation along demographic lines;language spoken and country of origin. Given the difficulty to collect timely migration data; inparticular for traits related to cultural assimilation; the methods that we develop and theresults that we provide open new lines of research that computational social scientists arewell-positioned to address.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.09430,2018,*
Professional Gender Gaps Across US Cities,Karri Haranko; Emilio Zagheni; Kiran Garimella; Ingmar Weber,Abstract: Gender imbalances in work environments have been a long-standing concern.Identifying the existence of such imbalances is key to designing policies to help overcomethem. In this work; we study gender trends in employment across various dimensions in theUnited States. This is done by analyzing anonymous; aggregate statistics that wereextracted from LinkedIn's advertising platform. The data contain the number of male andfemale LinkedIn users with respect to (i) location;(ii) age;(iii) industry and (iv) certain skills.We studied which of these categories correlate the most with high relative male or femalepresence on LinkedIn. In addition to examining the summary statistics of the LinkedIn data;we model the gender balance as a function of the different employee features using linearregression. Our results suggest that the gender gap varies across all feature types; but the …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.09429,2018,*

Cultural Fault Lines and Political Polarization,Yongren Shi; Kai Mast; Ingmar Weber; Agrippa Kellum; Michael Macy,Abstract Survey research reveals deep partisan divisions in the US that extend beyondpolitics to include cultural tastes; lifestyle choices; and consumer preferences. We show howco-following on Twitter can be used to measure the extent to which these divisions are alsoevident in social media. We measure political alignment (location on the red-blue spectrum);relevance (overlap between cultural and political interests); and polarization (internaldivision) in music; movies; hobbies; sports; vehicles; food and drink; technology; universities;religions; and business. The results provide compelling evidence that" Tesla liberals"{and"bird hunting conservatives" are stereotypes grounded in empirical reality.,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Web Science Conference,2017,*
Understanding Para Social Breakups on Twitter,Kiran Garimella; Jonathan Cohen; Ingmar Weber,Abstract Celebrity and fandom have been studied extensively in real life. Perceived virtualrelationships; commonly known as para-social relationships (PSR) have been shown toexist between celebrities and fans (Horton and Wohl; 1956). The end of such relationships;para-social breakups (PSB); have also been studied (Eyal and Cohen; 2006). However; withmore and more celebrities using social media; the dynamics of PSR and PSB havechanged. Using data from 57;000 fans for the top followed celebrities on Twitter; we try tounderstand how para-social breakups manifest on Twitter. We hypothesize that a PSB onTwitter happens as an act of unfollowing the celebrity and study the differences in engagingin a PSB between various types of fans. We find that; surprisingly; the most devoted fans aremore likely to be involved in a para-social breakup. Given our scale and dependence on …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Web Science Conference,2017,*
Digital Demography,Ingmar Weber,Abstract Demography is the science of human populations and; at its most basic; focuses onthe processes of (i) fertility;(ii) mortality and (iii) mobility. Whereas modern states are typicallyin a reasonable position to keep records on both fertility and mortality; through birth anddeath registrations; as well as through censuses; measuring the mobility of populationsrepresents a particular challenge due to reasons ranging from inconsistencies in officialdefinitions across countries; to the difficulty of quantifying illegal migration. At the same time;mere numbers; whether on births; deaths or migration events; shed little light on theunderlying causes; hence providing insufficient information to policy makers.

Inferring Regional and Temporal Eating Habits from Social Media Images,Yusuf Aytar; Antonio Torralba; Mehmet Efe Akengin; Ingmar Weber; Ferda Ofli; Raji Alhammouri,Understanding population level food consumption; which has considerable influence onpopulation health; is a major challenge. For instance; obesity; which is particularly pressingin the Gulf region; is largely driven by changes in food consumption. Many other widespreaddiseases; such as diabetes; heart disease; and high blood pressure; are directly or indirectlyaffected by eating habits. Understanding food consumption generally involves surveys andself reporting which introduce certain biases; latency and substantial cost. Social mediaoffers new possibilities to passively monitor and study eating behaviors; and track them inreal-time across regions and time.

Obesity has taken an epidemicproportion in such fast-developing countries; and we show that; for example; for Arabic-speakers posting from restaurants strongly correlates with posting from sweets shops.Furthermore; posts in Arabic attract almost three times as much liking and commenting asposts in English. However; we also show that social media has substantial limitations inaccurately reflecting the expat population; with languages of India and Nepal--whose expatpopulations outnumber the locals--being drastically under-represented.,Healthcare Informatics (ICHI); 2015 International Conference on,2015,*

Structural And Semantic Evolution Of Egyptian Political Polarization On Twitter,Javier Borge-holthoefer; Walid Magdy; Kareem Darwish; Ingmar Weber,At this point there is little question about whether online social networks have occupied (andoccupy) a central spot as the backbone of modern civil protests. This agreement hastriggered a whole research avenue; in which social structure (who is friends with whom) andcontent analysis (what is said online) have been central-though generally approachedseparately.

Relate-me: Making News More Relevant,Tamim Jabban; Bachelor Of Science; Computer Science; Ingmar Weber,To get readers of international news stories interested and engaged; it is important to showhow a piece of far-away news relates to them and how it might affect their own country. As astep in this direction; we have developed a tool to automatically create textual relationsbetween news articles and readers. To produce such connections; the first step is to detectthe countries mentioned in the article. Many news sites; including Al Jazeera (http://www.aljazeera. com); use automated tools such as OpenCalais (http://opencalais. com) to detectplace references in a news article and list those as a list of countries in a dedicated sectionat the bottom (say; List A:[Syria; Germany]). If not already included; relevant countries couldbe detected using existing tools and dictionaries. The second step is to use the reader's IPaddress to infer the country they are currently located in (say; Country B: Qatar). Knowing …,Qatar Foundation Annual Research Conference,2014,*
Building Tools For Dietary Health Monitoring: Studying Food Consumption Through Twitter,Yelena Mejova; Sofiane Abbar; Ingmar Weber,Food is an integral part of our lives; cultures; and well-being; and is of major interest topublic health. According to the International Diabetes Federation; 23% of adults in Qatar haddiabetes in 2013; being third most affected country in the Middle East and North Africaregion. Diet; as a major cause of such diseases; is thus an important subject of study both onpersonal and societal levels. However; the collection of daily nutritional data involveskeeping detailed diaries or periodic surveys and is limited in scope and reach. Alternatively;social media is infamous for allowing its users to update the world on the minutiae of theirdaily lives; including their eating habits. In this work we examine the potential of Twitter toprovide insight into US-wide dietary choices by linking the tweeted dining experiences of210K users to their interests; demographics; and social networks.

Visualizing life in Qatar through the lens of twitter,Ingmar Weber,In this interactive poster (a set of public web demos) we present insights into the socio-cultural activity in Qatar as seen on Twitter. Our starting point is the identification of around70;000 active Twitter users that are; either permanently or temporarily; based in Qatar. Thisidentification is done using a number of features such as (i) the self-stated location;(ii) thegeo-tagged position of tweets from geo-enabled mobile devices; and (iii) a large amount ofinterest (= following) in local Twitter accounts such as@ dohanews (" Doha News"); or@qatarevents (" I love Qatar"). Comparing to estimates from the Arab Social Media Reportcompiled by the Dubai School of Government we are confident that our sample includes themajority of active Twitter users in Qatar. For this user population we regularly obtain all theirpublic tweets using the public Twitter API and annotate them with geographic co …,Qatar Foundation Annual Research Conference,2013,*

From Republicans to Teenagers–Group Membership and Search (GRUMPS),Ingmar Weber; Djoerd Hiemstra; Pavel Serdyukov,Abstract In the early years of information retrieval; the focus of research was on systemsaspects such as crawling; indexing; and relevancy ranking. Over the years; more and moreuser-related information such as click information or search history has entered the equationcreating more and more personalized search experiences; though still within the scope ofthe same overall system. Though fully personalized search is probably desirable; thisindividualistic perspective does not exploit the fact that a lot of a users behavior can beexplained through their group membership. Children; despite individual differences; sharemany challenges and needs; as do men; Republicans; Chinese or any user group.

Advice for young Jedi knights and PhD students,Ingmar Weber,Abstract This talk will look at the task of pursuing a PhD with both a humorous and a seriouseye--while checking Facebook with yet another one. The goal is threefold: to give practicaladvice; to take a step back and look at the meaning at it all; and to entertain in doing so. Wewill give tips on how to choose an advisor and a thesis topic. We will look at differentsuccessful approaches to doing research and to publishing. In all of this the" human angle"is not lost and we will analyze common psychological hurdles. The practical advice will bebased on a mix of personal experience; books on the topic and a multitude of webresources. Zooming out; we will look at whether education can contribute to personalhappiness; and at financial incentives from the job market. Also" from a distance"; we willlook at studies of PhD attrition rates to better understand potential obstacles. Finally; there …,Proceedings of the 5th Ph.

Social piggybacking: leveraging common friends to generate event streams,Aristides Gionis; Flavio Junqueira; Vincent Leroy; Marco Serafini; Ingmar Weber,Abstract Social networking systems present users with online event streams that includerecent activities of their friends. Materialized per-user views are a common way to generatesuch event streams on-line and with low latency. We propose improving throughput by usingsocial piggybacking: process the requests of two friends by just querying and updating theview of a third common friend. By using one such hub view; the system can serve requests ofthe first friend without querying nor updating the view of the second. This reduces the overallload on views; and can be implemented with minimal adaptations by existing socialnetworking architectures. We show that; given a social graph; there exist hub-basedschedules that minimize the overall number of view requests; but computing them is NP-hard. We propose a heuristic to solve the problem and evaluate it using samples from the …,Proceedings of the Fifth Workshop on Social Network Systems,2012,*

Smart but Fun: A Data-Driven Portrait of Wikipedia Editors,Robert West; Ingmar Weber; Carlos Castillo,ABSTRACT While there has been a substantial amount of research into the editorial andorganizational processes within Wikipedia; little is known about how Wikipedia editors(Wikipedians) relate to the online world in general. We attempt to shed light on this issue byusing aggregated log data from Yahoo!'s browser toolbar in order to analyze Wikipedians'editing behavior in the context of their online lives beyond Wikipedia. We broadlycharacterize editors by investigating how their online behavior differs from that of otherusers; eg; we find that Wikipedia editors search more; read more news; play more games;and; perhaps surprisingly; are more immersed in pop culture. Then we inspect how editors'general interests relate to the articles to which they contribute; eg; we confirm the intuitionthat editors show more expertise in their active domains than average users.

of Proceedings: String Processing and Information Retrieval: 13th International Conference; SPIRE 2006,Holger Bast; Christian Worm Mortensen; Ingmar Weber,Abstract/Description: We consider the following autocompletion search scenario: imagine auser of a search engine typing a query; then with every keystroke display those completionsof the last query word that would lead to the best hits; and also display the best such hits.The following problem is at the core of this feature: for a fixed document collection; given aset D of documents; and an alphabetical range W of words; compute the set of all word-in-document pairs (w; d) from the collection such that w∈ W and d∈ D. We present a new datastructure with the help of which such autocompletion queries can be processed; on theaverage; in time linear in the input plus output size; independent of the size of the underlyingdocument collection. At the same time; our data structure uses no more space than aninverted index. Actual query processing times on a large test collection correlate almost …,*,2006,*
Ultrasound Technology and ‘Missing Women’in India: Analyses and Now-casts Based on Google Searches,Ridhi Kashyap; Francesco Billari; Nicolo Cavalli; Eric Qian; Ingmar Weber,Abstract In contexts of entrenched cultural preference for male offspring; such as in parts ofnorthwest and central India; growing access to prenatal sex determination throughultrasound has enabled the practice of sex-selective abortion. This practice has led to'missing women'; with the sex ratio at birth (SRB) becoming distorted with unnaturally moreboys born relative to girls. SRB distortions and their variations across different states in Indiahave been widely documented; but data on state-level trends are often erratic and not up-to-date. Moreover; the timeline of diffusion of ultrasound technology is less documented; andso is the role of online information in shaping the decision to practice sex-selective abortion.We use information on Google searches related to ultrasound and sonography; both at thenational level and at the level of Indian states; to assess whether these data track the …,*,*,*
Optimizing Fagin’s TA algorithms (OFTA),Holger Bast; Ingmar Weber; Debapriyo Majumdar,1. Fagin's top-k algorithms are designed for generic aggregation functions; the onlyrequirement being that they are monotone; for specific functions; these algorithms mayperform unnecessary operations. Our project will try to assess whether it is possible to tweakthe algorithms for two specific aggregation functions (to be chosen from max; max1+ max2and median) in such way that they perform better than the generic versions; and try tocompare the time required and memory consumption. The first part will consist of a closerstudy of the literature about the use of particular aggregation functions for these top-kalgorithms and their possible extensions. The second part will be dedicated to the analysis;design and implementation of the chosen algorithm versions; followed by testing andinterpretation of results.,*,*,*

Searching with Autocompletion: An Indexing Scheme with Provably Fast Response Time,Holger Bast; Christian W Mortensen; Ingmar Weber,Abstract. We study the following autocompletion problem; which is at the core of a new full-text search technology that we have developed over the last year. The problem is; for agiven document collection; to precompute a data structure using as little space as possiblesuch that queries of the following kind can be processed as quickly as possible: given arange of words and an arbitrary set of documents; compute the set of those words from thegiven range; which occur in at least one of the given documents; as well as the subset of thegiven documents; which contain at least one of these words. With a standard inverted index;one inverted list has to be processed for each word from the given range. We propose a newindexing scheme that without using more space than an inverted index has a guaranteedquery processing time that is independent of the size of the given word range …,*,*,*
