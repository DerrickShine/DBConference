The politics of democratization in Hong Kong,Shiu-hing Lo,The dynamics of democratisation in Hong Kong have varied with time. Institutional reform in 1982was not due to the China factor; but to administrative decentralisation. But the China factor becameinfluential in 1984 when Britain introduced democratic reforms in order to protect HongKong''s autonomy vis-a-vis China after 1997. China''s Tiananmen incident in 1989 triggered an"explosion of civil society" in Hong Kong and changed the British policy towards the colony. WhileBritain is like a soft-liner in support of Hong Kong''s democratisation; China remains a hard-lineropposing any drastic political change in the territory. Since 1984; China has become both a stimulusand an obstacle to democratisation in Hong Kong … The case study of Hong Kong offers severallessons on the processes of democratisation.

The dynamics of Beijing-Hong Kong relations: A model for Taiwan?,Sonny Shiu-Hing Lo,This book critically assesses the implementation of the" one country; two systems" in theHong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) from the political; judicial; legal;economic and societal dimensions. The author contends that there has been a gradualprocess of mainlandization of the HKSAR; meaning that Hong Kong is increasinglyeconomically dependent on the People's Republic of China (PRC); politically deferent to thecentral government on the scope and pace of democratic reforms; socially more patriotictoward the motherland and more prone to media self-censorship; and judicially morevulnerable to the interpretation of the Basic Law by the National People's Congress.

Casino politics; organized crime and the post-colonial state in Macau,Shiu Hing Lo,Organized crime and politics have been traditionally intertwined in Macau. During thecolonial era; the Portuguese administration was characterized by bureaucratic corruptionand a cozy relationship with casino capitalists. The colonial state had limited autonomy vis-à-vis the casino capitalists. With the growth of tourism and the associated casino industry inMacau during the 1990s; organized crime groups penetrated various casinos and emergedas a baffling problem. Yet; neither the Portuguese administration nor the casino capitalistshad the capability to contain the use of violence by organized crime groups. As Macauapproached the end of the Portuguese colonial rule; the People's Republic of China (PRC)decided to intervene in the rapidly deteriorating law and order.

Casino capitalism and its legitimacy impact on the politico-administrative state in Macau,Sonny Lo,Abstract Casino capitalism has its dialectical tendencies in Macau. On the one hand; itstimulates economic growth; provides employment; and strengthens the post-colonial statein Macau during the period of economic boom. On the other hand; casino capitalism canwiden the income gap between the rich and the poor; generate addictive gambling; and de-legitimize the post-colonial state in Macau during the global and regional economicdownturn. The weaknesses of the politico-administrative state in Macau; including theabsence of institutional checks and balances; the frail civil society and the relatively docilemass media; have magnified the negative impacts of casino capitalism on Macau. Inresponse to the negative ramifications; the Macau government has taken measures to bemore interventionist; to enhance social welfare; and to prepare contingency plans that …,Journal of Current Chinese Affairs,2009,33

Macau in transition: the politics of decolonization,Herbert S Yee; Sonny SH Lo,Decolonization is a process in which colonial policymakers delegate more administrativeand political power to indigenous peoples. Usually this process is marked by moreautonomy for local insti-tutions; such as a legislature; and by recruiting local people into thecivil service. In other words; political autonomy and localization of the civil service can beregarded as the essence of decolonization. Macau is no ex-ception to this rule. Portugal'sparliament in February 1990 approved revisions to Macau's constitution; the Organic Statute;drafted by the territory's Legislative Assembly. One major purpose of the revisions; accordingto former Macau Governor Carlos Melancia; was to give Macau more" autonomy" in enactingits own laws. 1 Macau's political autonomy has been partly enhanced by strengthening theLegislative Assembly and its representation through the addition of six Assembly seats …,Asian Survey,1991,24

The Chief Executive; Edmund Ho; has implemented a multiplicity of reformstrategies for the sake of consolidating his legitimacy. The twilight of the Portuguese colonialera was plagued by a rapid deterioration in law and order and the persistence in publicmaladministration; thus weakening the departing colonial regime's performance legitimacyseriously. As such; the political environment was conducive to Ho's herculean efforts atestablishing his performance legitimacy.

One formula; two experiences: political divergence of Hong Kong and Macao since retrocession,Sonny Shiu-Hing Lo,Since the return of Hong Kong's sovereignty to the People's Republic of China; the territory'spolitical development has diverged from that of Macao. The poverty of leadership; state–society confrontations; deinstitutionalization and Beijing's explicit intervention have markedHong Kong's political development from 1997 to 2004. Since April 2004; the Hong Konggoverning style has converged with that of Macao in terms of its pragmatism. AlthoughMacao's political development is characterized by leadership finesse; state–societypartnership and institutionalization; its relatively weak civil society and lack of democraticreforms are by no means an attractive 'one country; two systems' model to Taiwan; nor doesHong Kong's 'one country; two systems' appeal to the Republic of China.

Analytically; a typologyshowing several different categories of'pro-China''elite can be identified.

The politics of policing the anti-WTO protests in Hong Kong,Sonny Lo Shiu-hing,Abstract The confrontations between anti-World Trade Organisation (WTO) protestors andHong Kong police proved that their earlier encounters brought about uncompromisingattitudes and escalating activities on both sides. As a result; riots on the penultimate day ofthe WTO meeting were inevitable. Applying David Waddington's flashpoint model; this articleshows that other factors at the structural; political/ideological; cultural; contextual andsituational levels were at play; creating an environment conducive to violence. Waddington'smodel provides a useful framework for us to comprehend the interactional dynamics of theanti-WTO protests in Hong Kong. However; it has neglected the possibility of an interactivebond between protestors and the public. The contextual uniqueness of forging a dynamicrelationship between protestors and the public can enrich Waddington's analytical …,Asian Journal of Political Science,2006,15

Bureaucratic corruption and its control in Macao,Shiu-hing Lo,Bureaucratic corruption was a hallmark of Macao's public administration from the 1960s tothe 1980s. Although an anti-corruption commission was established in 1991; its role has notbeen clearly defined and its power has been limited. There is strong opposition toanticorruption work both inside and outside the government. The politicized bureaucrats;conservative-minded legislators; local judges; and business leaders are reluctant to confersubstantial power to the anti-corruption commission. The fight against corruption in Macaobecomes ineffective without the support and cooperation of the ruling and societal elites. AsMacao is economically integrated into China where bureaucratic corruption is rampant;corruption in Macao will remain a problem that needs to be tackled urgently.,Asian Journal of Public Administration,1993,15
The Tibet question and the Hong Kong experience,Barry Sautman; Shiu-hing Lo,The two parts of China's periphery discussed in this monograph; Tibet and Hong Kong; havecaused much ink to flow in the 1980s and 1990s. Hong Kong has been a center of attentionbecause; with one two-hundredth the population of the mainland; it has an aggregate wealthabout one-fourth that of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The territory is also in aunique position: long a colony; it is nevertheless not about to become independent.Burdened by protracted and detailed negotiations; it is to revert to the mother country fromwhose control it was wrested; while retaining a" high degree of autonomy" in futuregovernance.

Beijing's relations with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: an inferential framework for the post-1997 arrangement,Jae Ho Chung; Shiu-hing Lo,This article explores the post-1997 relationship between Beijing and the Hong Kong SpecialAdministrative Region from a central-local relations perspective. At the same time;inferences are made from the trends emerging from China's current dealing with Hong Kongduring the transition period. The article posits and inferential framework adopting four areasof interaction: planning and coordination; fiscal arrangements; personnel management andpolicy implementation. It concludes that the transition and post-transition arrangements canbe viewed as a gradual and incremental process of learning and mutual adaptation by bothsides. Moreover; administrative decentralization in China will coexist with Beijing'spenetrative capacity in exerting political control over Hong Kong. Yet; Beijing will continue toselectively allow autonomy of post-1997 Hong Kong as long as the expanded autonomy …,Pacific Affairs,1995,12
Colonial policy-makers; capitalist class and China: Determinants of electoral reform in Hong Kong's and Macau's legislatures,Shiu-hing Lo,One-fifth of the members in Hong Kong's Legislative Council will be directly elected bycitizens in future geographical constituencies in 1991. However; one third of the members inMacau's Legislative Assembly were directly elected by citizens in 1976. In comparison withMacau; the pace of introducing directly elected seats to the colonial legislature was slow inHong Kong from the 1970s to 1988. Unlike the Portuguese administrators in Macau; theBritish policy-makers in Hong Kong lacked the political will and missed several opportunitiesto democratize the colonial legislature. Moreover; the split within the capitalist classaccounted for the early implementation of electoral reform in Macau's legislature. In bothHong Kong and Macau; a triple alliance between the colonial policy-makers; the capital istclass and the People's Republic of China determined the way in which electoral reform …,Pacific Affairs,1989,11

Political Parties; Élite—Mass Gap and Political Instability in Hong Kong,Lo Shiu Hing,Political parties play a stabilizing role in any regime through articulation and aggregation ofthe interests of citizens. In the case of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region(HKSAR); however; political parties that are popularly supported by citizens have minimalinfluence on the government. The HKSAR Government is increasingly dominated byclientelist parties and élites without strong grass-roots support. As the economic gapbetween the haves and have-nots becomes increasingly serious; and Hong Kong peopleare not satisfied with many livelihood issues such as housing; the unrepresentative andclient-dominated polity will widen the gap between the government and ordinary citizens;with the potential danger of political instability.,Contemporary Southeast Asia,1998,9

In 1992; ae" pro-China" political partynamed the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB) was formed. TheDAB tested its political strength in a by-election held for the Regional Council (Regco) inAugust 1993.

Theweak anticrime apparatus and civil servants' and politicians' lack of ethical behavior providefertile ground for political corruption to persist. Clean government's defenders include mostprosecutors; court judges; media professionals; and social activists. But civil servants needto be educated on the values of public accountability; financial propriety; and personalethics.

There was understandable confusionabout the intentions of the PRC. While Beijing was not slow to respond to the Hong Kongcrisis; the responses of its numerous agencies were different and their intelligence andunderstanding of the situation were so diverse that outsiders did not get a sense of who wasreally in command. From July to November 2003; various delegations from the mainlandwere sent to Hong Kong at both the central level and various provincial levels; discussingthe way forward with Hong Kong democrats.

Although the British have succeeded inprojecting an image of standing up for fair and open elections in Hong Kong; their failure toreach an agreement with China will result in a backlash—giving more room to the Chineseside to shape; control and recolonize aspects of Hong Kong's polity after 1997.

The political culture of Beijing constantly clashes with that of the pro-democracyHong Kong people; who regard themselves as politically mature enough to enjoy the luxuryof Western-style democracy. The collision between the two political cultures came to a headin December 2005; when the pro-democracy legislators rejected the political reformblueprint proposed by the Hong Kong government.

Party penetration of society in Hong Kong: The role of mutual aid committees and political parties,Lo Shiu Hing,Party penetration of society can be illuminated by the study of how political parties in HongKong have been infiltrating Mutual Aid Committees (MACs); which are housingorganisations in private and public buildings. While “administrative absorption of politics”was viewed as a hallmark of Hong Kong under British rule during the 1970s; politicalpenetration of local administration has emerged as the feature of the body politic since the1990s. The colonial government's neglect of the MACs in the 1990s has been inherited bythe post‐colonial administration since the transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty in 1997. Onthe other hand; some MACs have penetrated political parties because they find that thegovernment has swept them under the carpet and that parties can deliver various constituentservices.

Casino interests; Fujian Tongxianghui and electoral politics in Macao,Sonny Shiu-Hing Lo; Eric King-Man Chong,ABSTRACT The study of hometown associations has been traditionally focused on theirsocial and cultural activities; but little research has been conducted on their political andelectoral participation. The direct elections held for the Legislative Assembly in September2013 in the Macao Special Administrative Region were characterised by the emergence of aclear triangular relationship between casino interests; Fujianese tongxianghui (a hometownassociation or an interest group with members sharing the same locality ties) and electoralpolitics. The prominent victory of an electoral group led by the Fujianese tongxianghui andrepresented under the umbrella of the United Citizens Association of Macao (UCAM) wasunprecedented in Macao's political participation and historical development.

Political Distrust; Governability and Institutional Deadlock in Hong Kong.,Sonny Shiu Hing Lo,Abstract Since the reversion of its sovereignty from Britain to China on 1 July 1997; HongKong has witnessed a serious crisis of legitimacy in terms of both performance andprocedural aspects. In terms of performance; the Hong Kong government has beenconstantly criticized by an assertive mass media; an active civil society; and the ideology ofpopulism; which sees public opinion as of paramount importance. The problem ofgovernability in Hong Kong reveals deep political distrust and institutional deadlock in thespecial administrative region. Although the Hong Kong government; with the support of thecentral government in Beijing; tries to tackle the governability problem by considering andpromising political reforms; notably the direct election of the Chief Executive in 2017;citizens' deep political distrust of the government does not bode well for the prospects of …,Journal of Youth Studies (10297847),2014,3
The changing context and content of policing in China and Hong Kong: policy transfer and modernisation,Sonny Shiu-Hing Lo,Despite the different policing environment between mainland China and the Hong KongSpecial Administrative Region (HKSAR); the mainland police have been learning from theHong Kong experience in the area of operation. To enhance the manpower of mainlandpolice; private security companies have been legalised while residents' anti-crime groupshave been partially incorporated into the regular police force. The auxiliary police force hasbecome an experiment in some mainland cities; whereas the Hong Kong practice of policehandbooks is viewed as a model for the mainland. The mainland police have beenimplementing various reform measures; such as the mass line concept; the visitationscheme; the heightened sensitivity toward 'radical'individual and mass action in publicplaces; the improved quality and quantity of police officers; and the recognition of the …,Policing and Society,2012,3
Globalization; State Autonomy and the Fight against Cross-Border Crime: Greater China's Cooperation with the World,Sonny Lo,Abstract Although globalization has stimulated the rise in cross-border crime; it does notreally undermine the autonomy of the mainland Chinese state; the Taiwan state; and the city-states of Hong Kong and Macao. Instead; through cooperation with law-enforcementagencies in other countries; the law-enforcement agencies of these four places; notably thepolice and customs; have ensured the persistence of state autonomy vis-à-vis cross-bordercriminal groups and individuals. In the case of Greater China (mainland China; Taiwan;Hong Kong and Macao); interstate cooperation involving the police and customs canmaintain state autonomy vis-à-vis criminal groups and individuals. The mechanisms of suchinterstate and intergovernmental cooperation embrace the sharing of criminal intelligence;the occurrence of anti-crime joint operations; the holding of seminars and conferences …,Asian Journal of Political Science,2009,3
SARS and avian influenza in China and Canada: the politics of controlling infectious disease,Sonny Shiu-Hing Lo,Since the outbreak of avian influenza in Hong Kong in December 1997; infectious diseasehas become a human and national security threat to the Asia Pacific region (Osterholm2005). In Asian cities where population density is high; such as Hong Kong; Singapore; andMacao; the emergence of any influenza pandemic endangers the lives of all citizens. Ingeographically spacious countries; notably the People's Republic of China (PRC) andIndonesia; any looming pandemic would be socially destabilising and politicallydelegitimising. In the United States the Spanish influenza that broke out in 1918 resulted incivil disorder and riots in some cities (Garrett 2005).

Guest Editors' Introduction: The 2004 Legislative Council Elections in Hong Kong: The Triumph of China's United Front Work After the July 2003 and 2004 Protests,Sonny Lo; Yu Wing Yat; Kwong Kam Kwan; Wong Wai Kwok,The results of the Legislative Council elections on September 12; 2004; could be seen asthe triumph of the united front work conducted by the People's Republic of China (PRC) onthe Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). 1 Despite the fact that almost half amillion protestors took to the streets to demonstrate against the political incompetence andmaladministration of the Tung Chee Hwa government on July 1; 2003; and July 1; 2004; 2the election results demonstrated that the pan-democratic camp in the HKSAR failed tocapture a majority of the sixty-member Legislative Council. From the perspective of thePRC's political control over Hong Kong; the tide of the pan-democratic forces was stemmedand the ability of the Tung government to maintain its executive dominance remainedsecure; at least in the short run.

The politics of sustaining; reversing and constraining private democratisation in Hong Kong,Lo Shiu Hing,Democratisation in Hong Kong has proceeded in four phases:• a stagnant period before theSino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong's future was initialled in September 1984;• aperiod of sustaining democratisation from September 1984 to the end of the Britishsovereignty at midnight on 30 June 1997;• a period of reverse democratisation in HongKong from 1995 to June 1997 which was triggered by the People's Republic of China (PRC)in response to the political reforms implemented by Governor Christopher Patten;• a periodof constrained democratisation since the establishment of the Hong Kong SpecialAdministrative Region (HKSAR) on 1 July 1997.

The politics of localisation of the civil service in Hong Kong and Macau,Lo Shiu Hing,The pattern of decolonisation in the former British colonies in Africa and Asia was verydifferent from that in the former Portuguese colonies. While localisation of the civil servicebecame the hallmark of British decolonisation; there was no attempt to localise thebureaucracy as the Portuguese left their colonies in Africa rapidly and chaotically.'Africanisation'of the civil service had begun shortly after the Second World War; when theBritish developed secondary and tertiary education in order to groom Africans to assumesenior government posts. 1 Even prior to the onset of decolonisation; some degreeof'Africanisation'of the bureaucracy could be seen in British Africa where'indirect rule'throughthe political dominance of different ethnic groups in different localities served the purpose ofstabilising colonial governance. 2 In contrast to the British'indirect rule'in their former …,Journal of Commonwealth & Comparative Politics,1995,3

Factionalism and Chinese-style democracy: the 2017 Hong Kong Chief Executive election,Sonny Shiu-Hing Lo,The 2017 Chief Executive election in Hong Kong demonstrated the severity of factionalpolitics in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region; where the pro-democracy factionhas been struggling for power against the pro-Beijing camp. It also showed MainlandChina's emphasis on the centralist aspect of the principle of democratic centralism in whichthe Hong Kong Chief Executive was elected by a relatively small group of elites; most ofwhom were under the influence of Beijing. The Chinese-style of democracy was reflected inthe desire of Mainland officials and the pro-Beijing press to ensure the easy victory of CarrieLam; who was the only candidate from the pro-Beijing faction. The efforts of Beijing and itsagents to secure Lam's victory pervaded the pre-nomination; nomination; campaign andelection; and post-election stages of the electoral process.

Can the legislature in a half-baked democracy serve the public?,Dennis Ka Kuen Leung; Sonny Shiu Hing Lo,In ideal democracies; the legislature serves as the political representative of the people;making laws to promote the public's interests. But in Hong Kong; the powers of theLegislative Council (LegCo) are always questionable; for two reasons. First; as prescribedby the Basic Law; the political system of Hong Kong is designed to be executive-led innature. The government alone holds the power to initiate policy changes; while the LegCo isjust offered powers to monitor and challenge the government; and thus is perceived by somemembers of the community as being 'destructive'rather than 'constructive'. Second; thefunction of the LegCo as the people's representative is hampered by its own undemocraticnature; with only half of its members elected by popular vote; the other half mainly bycorporate vote manipulated by vested business interests.

Since the 1990s; the proliferation of Master of PublicAdministration (MPA) programmes in both the Hong Kong and Macao Special AdministrativeRegions can be explained by the demand for local people to govern the two places inaccordance with the principle of 'one country; two systems'. The content of various MPAprogrammes also reflects the changing political and administrative circumstances; its publicadministration focus has been accompanied by core courses training students from a varietyof disciplines; ranging from public finance to economics; from public policy analyses to …,Asian Journal of Political Science,2014,1

SinceChinese leaders have repeatedly rejected Western-style democracyor multipartycompetition for China; the extent to which the Hong Kong experiencewould serve as amodel for political developments on the mainland isclearly limited. Nonetheless; politicalchanges in Hong Kong has to be seen aspart of China's experience following their reunion.Under the" one country; twosystems" formula; Hong Kong is given the freedom to conduct itsown internalaffairs as a Special Administrative Region (SAR); but the formation of anelectedlegislature that is formally part of the PRC is still a significant event in thepoliticalhistory of the country.,Chinese Law and Government,1999,1

Comparative grand corruption and protection pacts among elites: the cases of Ao Man Long in Macao and Hui Si-Yan in Hong Kong,Sonny Shiu-hing Lo,ABSTRACT Although Transparency International has consistently ranked the governmentsof both the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and Macao SpecialAdministrative Region (MSAR); both under the sovereignty of the People's Republic ofChina (PRC); much higher on the clean governance scale than the PRC itself; the reality isthat the two special administrative regions witnessed two prominent cases of politicalcorruption comparable to the mainland corruption. These were the Ao Man Long case inMacao and the Rafael Hui Si-yan scandal in Hong Kong. This paper examines the twocases of political corruption in both Macao and Hong Kong and makes comparisons andcontrasts between them.
