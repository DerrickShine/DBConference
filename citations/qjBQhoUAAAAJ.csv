Graph model based indoor tracking,Christian S Jensen; Hua Lu; Bin Yang,The tracking of the locations of moving objects in large indoor spaces is important; as itenables a range of applications related to; eg; security and indoor navigation and guidance.This paper presents a graph model based approach to indoor tracking that offers a uniformdata management infrastructure for different symbolic positioning technologies; eg;Bluetooth and RFID. More specifically; the paper proposes a model of indoor space thatcomprises a base graph and mappings that represent the topology of indoor space atdifferent levels. The resulting model can be used for one or several indoor positioningtechnologies. Focusing on RFID-based positioning; an RFID specific reader deploymentgraph model is built from the base graph model. This model is then used in severalalgorithms for constructing and refining trajectories from raw RFID readings. Empirical …,Mobile Data Management: Systems; Services and Middleware; 2009. MDM'09.

Probabilistic threshold k nearest neighbor queries over moving objects in symbolic indoor space,Bin Yang; Hua Lu; Christian S Jensen,Abstract The availability of indoor positioning renders it possible to deploy location-basedservices in indoor spaces. Many such services will benefit from the efficient support for knearest neighbor (kNN) queries over large populations of indoor moving objects. However;existing kNN techniques fall short in indoor spaces because these differ from Euclidean andspatial network spaces and because of the limited capabilities of indoor positioningtechnologies. To contend with indoor settings; we propose the new concept of minimalindoor walking distance (MIWD) along with algorithms and data structures for distancecomputing and storage; and we differentiate the states of indoor moving objects based on apositioning device deployment graph; utilize these states in effective object indexingstructures; and capture the uncertainty of object locations. On these foundations; we study …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,83
Indexing the trajectories of moving objects in symbolic indoor space,Christian Jensen; Hua Lu; Bin Yang,Abstract Indoor spaces accommodate large populations of individuals. With appropriateindoor positioning; eg; Bluetooth and RFID; in place; large amounts of trajectory data resultthat may serve as a foundation for a wide variety of applications; eg; space planning; wayfinding; and security. This scenario calls for the indexing of indoor trajectories. Based on anappropriate notion of indoor trajectory and definitions of pertinent types of queries; the paperproposes two R-tree based structures for indexing object trajectories in symbolic indoorspace. The RTR-tree represents a trajectory as a set of line segments in a space spanned bypositioning readers and time. The TP 2 R-tree applies a data transformation that yields arepresentation of trajectories as points with extension along the time dimension. The paperdetails the structure; node organization strategies; and query processing algorithms for …,Advances in Spatial and Temporal Databases,2009,70
Query processing of massive trajectory data based on mapreduce,Qiang Ma; Bin Yang; Weining Qian; Aoying Zhou,Abstract With the development of positioning technologies and the boosting deployment ofinexpensive location-aware sensors; large volumes of trajectory data have emerged.However; efficient and scalable query processing over trajectory data remains a bigchallenge. We explore a new approach to this target in this paper; presenting a newframework for query processing over trajectory data based on MapReduce. Traditionaltrajectory data partitioning; indexing; and query processing technologies are extended sothat they may fully utilize the highly parallel processing power of large-scale clusters. Wealso show that the append-only scheme of MapReduce storage model can be a nice basefor handling updates of moving objects. Preliminary experiments show that this frameworkscales well in terms of the size of trajectory data set. It is also discussed the limitation of …,Proceeding of the first international workshop on Cloud data management,2009,67
Travel cost inference from sparse; spatio temporally correlated time series using markov models,Bin Yang; Chenjuan Guo; Christian S Jensen,Abstract The monitoring of a system can yield a set of measurements that can be modeledas a collection of time series. These time series are often sparse; due to missingmeasurements; and spatiotemporally correlated; meaning that spatially close time seriesexhibit temporal correlation. The analysis of such time series offers insight into theunderlying system and enables prediction of system behavior. While the techniquespresented in the paper apply more generally; we consider the case of transportation systemsand aim to predict travel cost from GPS tracking data from probe vehicles. Specifically; eachroad segment has an associated travel-cost time series; which is derived from GPS data. Weuse spatio-temporal hidden Markov models (STHMM) to model correlations among differenttraffic time series. We provide algorithms that are able to learn the parameters of an …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,55
Indoor—A New Data Management Frontier,Christian S Jensen; Hua Lu; Bin Yang,Abstract Much research has been conducted on the management of outdoor moving objects.In contrast; relatively little research has been conducted on indoor moving objects. Theindoor setting differs from outdoor settings in important ways; including the following two.First; indoor spaces exhibit complex topologies. They are composed of entities that areunique to indoor settings; eg; rooms and hallways that are connected by doors. As a result;conventional Euclidean distance and spatial network distance are inapplicable in indoorspaces. Second; accurate; GPS-like positioning is typically unavailable in indoor spaces.Rather; positioning is achieved through the use of technologies such as Bluetooth; Infrared;RFID; or Wi-Fi. This typically results in much less reliable and accurate positioning. Thispaper covers some preliminary research that explicitly targets an indoor setting …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull,2010,53
Stochastic skyline route planning under time-varying uncertainty,Bin Yang; Chenjuan Guo; Christian S Jensen; Manohar Kaul; Shuo Shang,Different uses of a road network call for the consideration of different travel costs: in routeplanning; travel time and distance are typically considered; and green house gas (GHG)emissions are increasingly being considered. Further; travel costs such as travel time andGHG emissions are time-dependent and uncertain. To support such uses; we proposetechniques that enable the construction of a multi-cost; time-dependent; uncertain graph(MTUG) model of a road network based on GPS data from vehicles that traversed the roadnetwork. Based on the MTUG; we define stochastic skyline routes that consider multiplecosts and time-dependent uncertainty; and we propose efficient algorithms to retrievestochastic skyline routes for a given source-destination pair and a start time.

EcoMark: evaluating models of vehicular environmental impact,Chenjuan Guo; Yu Ma; Bin Yang; Christian S Jensen; Manohar Kaul,Abstract The reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation is essentialfor achieving politically agreed upon emissions reduction targets that aim to combat globalclimate change. So-called eco-routing and eco-driving are able to substantially reduce GHGemissions caused by vehicular transportation. To enable these; it is necessary to be able toreliably quantify the emissions of vehicles as they travel in a spatial network. Thus; a numberof models have been proposed that aim to quantify the emissions of a vehicle based on GPSdata from the vehicle and a 3D model of the spatial network the vehicle travels in. Wedevelop an evaluation framework; called EcoMark; for such environmental impact models. Inaddition; we survey all eleven state-of-the-art impact models known to us. To gain insightinto the capabilities of the models and to understand the effectiveness of the EcoMark; we …,Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2012,45
Harvesting facts from textual web sources by constrained label propagation,Yafang Wang; Bin Yang; Lizhen Qu; Marc Spaniol; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract There have been major advances on automatically constructing large knowledgebases by extracting relational facts from Web and text sources. However; the world isdynamic: periodic events like sports competitions need to be interpreted with their respectivetimepoints; and facts such as coaching a sports team; holding political or business positions;and even marriages do not hold forever and should be augmented by their respectivetimespans. This paper addresses the problem of automatically harvesting temporal facts withsuch extended time-awareness. We employ pattern-based gathering techniques for factcandidates and construct a weighted pattern-candidate graph. Our key contribution is asystem called PRAVDA based on a new kind of label propagation algorithm with ajudiciously designed loss function; which iteratively processes the graph to label good …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,45
Scalable continuous range monitoring of moving objects in symbolic indoor space,Bin Yang; Hua Lu; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Indoor spaces accommodate large populations of individuals. The continuousrange monitoring of such objects can be used as a foundation for a wide variety ofapplications; eg; space planning; way finding; and security. Indoor space differs fromoutdoor space in that symbolic locations; eg; rooms; rather than Euclidean positions orspatial network locations are important. In addition; positioning based on presence sensingdevices; rather than; eg; GPS; is assumed. Such devices report the objects in their activationranges. We propose an incremental; query-aware continuous range query processingtechnique for objects moving in this setting. A set of critical devices is determined for eachquery; and only the observations from those devices are used to continuously maintain thequery result. Due to the limitations of the positioning devices; queries contain certain and …,Proceeding of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,44
Personalized route recommendation using big trajectory data,Jian Dai; Bin Yang; Chenjuan Guo; Zhiming Ding,When planning routes; drivers usually consider a multitude of different travel costs; eg;distances; travel times; and fuel consumption. Different drivers may choose different routesbetween the same source and destination because they may have different drivingpreferences (eg; time-efficient driving vs fuel-efficient driving). However; existing routingservices support little in modeling multiple travel costs and personalization-they usuallydeliver the same routes that minimize a single travel cost (eg; the shortest routes or thefastest routes) to all drivers. We study the problem of how to recommend personalized routesto individual drivers using big trajectory data. First; we provide techniques capable ofmodeling and updating different drivers' driving preferences from the drivers' trajectorieswhile considering multiple travel costs. To recommend personalized routes; we provide …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,42
Building Accurate 3D Spatial Networks to Enable Next Generation Intelligent Transportation Systems,Manohar Kaul; Bin Yang; Christian S Jensen,The use of accurate 3D spatial network models can enable substantial improvements invehicle routing. Notably; such models enable eco-routing; which reduces the environmentalimpact of transportation. We propose a novel filtering and lifting framework that augments astandard 2D spatial network model with elevation information extracted from massive aeriallaser scan data and thus yields an accurate 3D model. We present a filtering technique thatis capable of pruning irrelevant laser scan points in a single pass; but assumes that the 2Dnetwork fits in internal memory and that the points are appropriately sorted. We also providean external-memory filtering technique that makes no such assumptions. During lifting; atriangulated irregular network (TIN) surface is constructed from the remaining points. The 2Dnetwork is projected onto the TIN; and a 3D network is constructed by means of …,International Conference on Mobile Data Management,2013,41
Using incomplete information for complete weight annotation of road networks,Bin Yang; Manohar Kaul; Christian S Jensen,We are witnessing increasing interests in the effective use of road networks. For example; toenable effective vehicle routing; weighted-graph models of transportation networks areused; where the weight of an edge captures some cost associated with traversing the edge;eg; greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or travel time. It is a precondition to using a graphmodel for routing that all edges have weights. Weights that capture travel times and GHGemissions can be extracted from GPS trajectory data collected from the network. However;GPS trajectory data typically lack the coverage needed to assign weights to all edges. Thispaper formulates and addresses the problem of annotating all edges in a road network withtravel cost based weights from a set of trips in the network that cover only a small fraction ofthe edges; each with an associated ground-truth travel cost.

Toward personalized; context-aware routing,Bin Yang; Chenjuan Guo; Yu Ma; Christian S Jensen,Abstract A driver's choice of a route to a destination may depend on the route's length andtravel time; but a multitude of other; possibly hard-to-formalize aspects; may also factor intothe driver's decision. There is evidence that a driver's choice of route is context dependent;eg; varies across time; and that route choice also varies from driver to driver. In contrast;conventional routing services support little in the way of context dependence; and theydeliver the same routes to all drivers. We study how to identify context-aware drivingpreferences for individual drivers from historical trajectories; and thus how to providefoundations for personalized navigation; but also professional driver education and trafficplanning. We provide techniques that are able to capture time-dependent and uncertainproperties of dynamic travel costs; such as travel time and fuel consumption; from …,The VLDB Journal,2015,34

Searching and analysingmassive and frequently updated social media data brings significant and diverse rewardsacross many different application domains; from politics and business to social science andepidemiology. A notable proportion of social media data comes with explicit or implicitspatial annotations; and almost all social media data has temporal metadata.

EcoMark 2.0: empowering eco-routing with vehicular environmental models and actual vehicle fuel consumption data,Chenjuan Guo; Bin Yang; Ove Andersen; Christian S Jensen; Kristian Torp,Abstract Eco-routing is a simple yet effective approach to substantially reducing theenvironmental impact; eg; fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; ofvehicular transportation. Eco-routing relies on the ability to reliably quantify theenvironmental impact of vehicles as they travel in a spatial network. The procedure ofquantifying such vehicular impact for road segments of a spatial network is called eco-weight assignment. EcoMark 2.0 proposes a general framework for eco-weight assignmentto enable eco-routing. It studies the abilities of six instantaneous and five aggregatedmodels to estimating vehicular environmental impact. In doing so; it utilizes travelinformation derived from GPS trajectories (ie; velocities and accelerations) and actual fuelconsumption data obtained from vehicles. The framework covers analyses of actual fuel …,GeoInformatica,2015,32
Ecotour: Reducing the environmental footprint of vehicles using eco-routes,Ove Andersen; Christian S Jensen; Kristian Torp; Bin Yang,Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from transportation is essential in combating globalwarming and climate change. Eco-routing enables drivers to use the most eco-friendlyroutes and is effective in reducing vehicle emissions. The EcoTour system assigns eco-weights to a road network based on GPS and fuel consumption data collected from vehiclesto enable ecorouting. Given an arbitrary source-destination pair in Denmark; EcoTourreturns the shortest route; the fastest route; and the eco-route; along with statistics for thethree routes.

Spatio-temporal joins on symbolic indoor tracking data,Hua Lu; Bin Yang; Christian S Jensen,To facilitate a variety of applications; positioning systems are deployed in indoor settings.For example; Bluetooth and RFID positioning are deployed in airports to support real-timemonitoring of delays as well as off-line flow and space usage analyses. Such deploymentsgenerate large collections of tracking data. Like in other data management applications;joins are indispensable in this setting. However; joins on indoor tracking data call for noveltechniques that take into account the limited capabilities of the positioning systems as wellas the specifics of indoor spaces. This paper proposes and studies probabilistic; spatio-temporal joins on historical indoor tracking data. Two meaningful types of join are defined.They return object pairs that satisfy spatial join predicates either at a time point or during atime interval.

Finding top-k local users in geo-tagged social media data,Jinling Jiang; Hua Lu; Bin Yang; Bin Cui,Social network platforms and location-based services are increasingly popular in people'sdaily lives. The combination of them results in location-based social media where peopleare connected not only through the friendship in the social network but also by theirgeographical locations in reality. This duality makes it possible to query and make use ofsocial media data in novel ways. In this work; we formulate a novel and useful problemcalled top-k local user search (TkLUS for short) from tweets with geo-tags. Given a locationq; a distance r; and a set of keywords W; the TkLUS query finds the top-k users who haveposted tweets relevant to the desired keywords in W at a place within the distance r from q.TkLUS queries are useful in many application scenarios such as friend recommendation;spatial decision; etc. We design a set of techniques to answer such queries efficiently …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,25

Eco-routing; which enables drivers touse eco-friendly routes; is a simple and effective approach to reducing emissions fromtransportation. We present EcoSky; a system that annotates edges of a road network withtime dependent and uncertain eco-weights using GPS data and that supports different typesof eco-routing. Basic eco-routing returns the most eco-friendly routes; skyline eco-routingtakes into account not only fuel consumption but also travel time and distance whencomputing eco-routes; and personalized eco-routing considers each driver's past behaviorand accordingly suggests different routes to different drivers.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,21
Discovery of Path Nearby Clusters in Spatial Networks,Shuo Shang; Kai Zheng; Christian S Jensen; Bin Yang; Panos Kalnis; Guohe Li; J-R Wen,The discovery of regions of interest in large cities is an important challenge. We propose andinvestigate a novel query called the path nearby cluster (PNC) query that finds regions ofpotential interest (eg; sightseeing places and commercial districts) with respect to a user-specified travel route. Given a set of spatial objects O (eg; POIs; geo-tagged photos; or geo-tagged tweets) and a query route q; if a cluster c has high spatial-object density and isspatially close to q; it is returned by the query (a cluster is a circular region defined by acenter and a radius). This query aims to bring important benefits to users in popularapplications such as trip planning and location recommendation. Efficient computation of thePNC query faces two challenges: how to prune the search space during query processing;and how to identify clusters with high density effectively. To address these challenges; a …,*,*,21

Path cost distribution estimation using trajectory data,Jian Dai; Bin Yang; Chenjuan Guo; Christian S Jensen; Jilin Hu,Abstract With the growing volumes of vehicle trajectory data; it becomes increasinglypossible to capture time-varying and uncertain travel costs in a road network; includingtravel time and fuel consumption. The current paradigm represents a road network as aweighted graph; it blasts trajectories into small fragments that fit the under-lying edges toassign weights to edges; and it then applies a routing algorithm to the resulting graph. Wepropose a new paradigm; the hybrid graph; that targets more accurate and more efficientpath cost distribution estimation. The new paradigm avoids blasting trajectories into smallfragments and instead assigns weights to paths rather than simply to the edges. We showhow to compute path weights using trajectory data while taking into account the travel costdependencies among the edges in the paths.

Network-Matched Trajectory-Based Moving-Object Database: Models and Applications,Zhiming Ding; Bin Yang; RH Guting; Yaguang Li,Tracking and managing the locations of moving objects are essential in modern intelligenttransportation systems (ITSs). However; a number of limitations in existing methods makethem unsuitable for real-world ITS applications. In particular; Euclidean-based methods arenot accurate enough in representing locations and in analyzing traffic; unless the locationsare frequently updated. Network-based methods require either digital maps to be installed inmoving objects or transmission of prediction policies; which inevitably increase the cost. Tosolve these problems; we propose a network-matched trajectory-based moving-objectdatabase (NMTMOD) mechanism and a traffic flow analysis method using the NMTMOD. Inthe NMTMOD; the locations of moving objects are tracked through a dense sampling andbatch uploading strategy; and a novel edge-centric network-matching method; which is …,*,*,13
Efficient top-k spatial locality search for co-located spatial web objects,Qiang Qu; Siyuan Liu; Bin Yang; Christian S Jensen,In step with the web being used widely by mobile users; user location is becoming anessential signal in services; including local intent search. Given a large set of spatial webobjects consisting of a geographical location and a textual description (eg; Online businessdirectory entries of restaurants; bars; and shops); how can we find sets of objects that areboth spatially and textually relevant to a query? Most of existing studies solve the problem byrequiring that all query keywords are covered by the returned objects and then rank the setsby spatial proximity. The needs for identifying sets with more textually relevant objectsrender these studies inapplicable. We propose locality Search; a query that returns top-ksets of spatial web objects and integrates spatial distance and textual relevance in oneranking function.

Enabling Time-Dependent Uncertain Eco-Weights For Road Networks,Yu Ma; Bin Yang; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation is an essentialpart of the efforts to prevent global warming and climate change. Eco-routing; which enablesdrivers to use the most environmentally friendly routes; is able to substantially reduce GHGemissions from vehicular transportation. The foundation of eco-routing is a weighted-graphrepresentation of a road network in which road segments; or edges; are associated with eco-weights that capture the GHG emissions caused by traversing the edges. Due to thedynamics of traffic; the eco-weights are best modeled as being time dependent anduncertain. We formalize the problem of assigning a time-dependent; uncertain eco-weight toeach edge in a road network based on historical GPS records. In particular; a sequence ofhistograms is employed to describe the uncertain eco-weight of an edge at different time …,Proceedings of Workshop on Managing and Mining Enriched Geo-Spatial Data,2014,11

Web data areessentially heterogeneous data; and may change schema frequently; traditional relationaldata model is inappropriate for web data management. A new data model; called WideTable (or WT for simplicity); was introduced for this task. There are several characteristics ofthe WT model. First; WT is usually highly sparsely populated so that most data can be fit intoa line or record.

Finding shortest paths on terrains by killing two birds with one stone,Manohar Kaul; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Bin Yang; Christian S Jensen,Abstract With the increasing availability of terrain data; eg; from aerial laser scans; themanagement of such data is attracting increasing attention in both industry and academia. Inparticular; spatial queries; eg; k-nearest neighbor and reverse nearest neighbor queries; inEuclidean and spatial network spaces are being extended to terrains. Such queries all relyon an important operation; that of finding shortest surface distances. However; shortestsurface distance computation is very time consuming. We propose techniques that enableefficient computation of lower and upper bounds of the shortest surface distance; whichenable faster query processing by eliminating expensive distance computations.

Efficient and Accurate Path Cost Estimation Using Trajectory Data,Jian Dai; Bin Yang; Chenjuan Guo; Christian S Jensen,Abstract: Using the growing volumes of vehicle trajectory data; it becomes increasinglypossible to capture time-varying and uncertain travel costs in a road network; includingtravel time and fuel consumption. The current paradigm represents a road network as agraph; assigns weights to the graph's edges by fragmenting trajectories into small piecesthat fit the underlying edges; and then applies a routing algorithm to the resulting graph. Wepropose a new paradigm that targets more accurate and more efficient estimation of thecosts of paths by associating weights with sub-paths in the road network. The paperprovides a solution to a foundational problem in this paradigm; namely that of computing thetime-varying cost distribution of a path. The solution consists of several steps. We first learn aset of random variables that capture the joint distributions of sub-paths that are covered …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1510.02886,2015,7
iPark: identifying parking spaces from trajectories,Bin Yang; Nicolas Fantini; Christian S Jensen,Abstract A wide variety of desktop and mobile Web applications involve geo-tagged content;eg; photos and (micro-) blog postings. Such content; often called User Generated Geo-Content (UGGC); plays an increasingly important role in many applications. However; agreat demand also exists for" core" UGGC where the geo-spatial aspect is not just a tag onother content; but is the primary content; eg; a city street map with up-to-date roadconstruction data. Along these lines; the iPark system aims to turn volumes of GPS dataobtained from vehicles into information about the locations of parking spaces; thus enablingeffective parking search applications. In particular; we demonstrate how iPark helps ordinaryusers annotate an existing digital map with two types of parking; on-street parking andparking zones; based on vehicular tracking data.,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,6
Finding non-dominated paths in uncertain road networks,Saad Aljubayrin; Bin Yang; Christian S Jensen; Rui Zhang,Abstract With the rapidly growing availability of vehicle trajectory data; travel costs such astravel time and fuel consumption can be captured accurately as distributions (eg; travel timedistributions) instead of deterministic values (eg; average travel times). We study a new pathfinding problem in uncertain road networks; where paths have travel cost distributions. Givena source and a destination; we find optimal; non-dominated paths connecting the sourceand the destination; where the optimality is defined in terms of the stochastic dominanceamong cost distributions of paths. We first design an A based framework that utilizes theuncertain graph to obtain the most accurate cost distributions while finding the candidatepaths. Next; we propose a three-stage dominance examination method that employsextreme values in each candidate path's cost distribution for early detection of dominated …,Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2016,5
Finding Top-k Shortest Paths with Diversity,Huiping Liu; Cheqing Jin; Bin Yang,The classical K Shortest Paths (KSP) problem; which identifies the $ k $ shortest simplepaths in a directed graph; plays an important role in many application domains; such asproviding alternative paths for vehicle routing services. However; the returned $ k $ shortestpaths may be highly similar; ie; sharing significant amounts of edges; thus adverselyaffecting service qualities. In this paper; we formalize the K Shortest Paths with Diversity(KSPD) problem that identifies top-$ k $ shortest simple paths such that the paths aredissimilar with each other and the total length of the paths is minimized. We first prove thatthe KSPD problem is NP-hard and then propose a generic greedy framework to solve theKSPD problem. The core of the framework includes the use of two judiciously designedlower bounds; where one is dependent on and the other one is independent on the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,4
PACE: a PAth-CEntric paradigm for stochastic path finding,Bin Yang; Jian Dai; Chenjuan Guo; Christian S Jensen; Jilin Hu,Abstract With the growing volumes of vehicle trajectory data; it becomes increasinglypossible to capture time-varying and uncertain travel costs; eg; travel time; in a road network.The current paradigm for doing so is edge-centric: it represents a road network as aweighted graph and splits trajectories into small fragments that fit the underlying edges toassign time-varying and uncertain weights to edges. It then applies path finding algorithmsto the resulting; weighted graph. We propose a new PA th-CE ntric paradigm; PACE; thattargets more accurate and more efficient path cost estimation and path finding. By assigningweights to paths; PACE avoids splitting trajectories into small fragments. We solve twofundamental problems to establish the PACE paradigm:(i) how to compute accurately thetravel cost distribution of a path and (ii) how to conduct path finding for a source …,The VLDB Journal,2017,4
Moir/uots: Trip recommendation with user oriented trajectory search,Kuien Liu; Bin Yang; Shuo Shang; Yaguang Li; Zhiming Ding,Trajectory search plays an important role in various applications such as trip planning andrecommendation. However; most existing studies only focus on spatial proximity but ignoreindividual users' preferences. For example; it is inappropriate to recommend a routecontaining gravel roads to travelers without off-road vehicles. To accommodate various userpreferences; we develop MOIR/UOTS; a trip recommendation system that supports UserOriented Trajectory Search (UOTS)[5];[7] based on our previous MOIR platform [2];[4].Meanwhile; MOIR/UOTS also functions as a test-bed system for exploring and evaluatingnovel trajectory searching algorithms. In particular; we demonstrate how ordinary users caninteract with MOIR/UOTS to search for trajectories with their preferences; and howMOIR/UOTS helps researchers to evaluate the performance of various algorithms.,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on,2013,4

Risk-aware path selection with time-varying; uncertain travel costs: a time series approach,Jilin Hu; Bin Yang; Chenjuan Guo; Christian S Jensen,Abstract We address the problem of choosing the best paths among a set of candidate pathsbetween the same origin–destination pair. This functionality is used extensively whenconstructing origin–destination matrices in logistics and flex transportation. Because the costof a path; eg; travel time; varies over time and is uncertain; there is generally no single bestpath. We partition time into intervals and represent the cost of a path during an interval as arandom variable; resulting in an uncertain time series for each path. When facinguncertainties; users generally have different risk preferences; eg; risk-loving or risk-averse;and thus prefer different paths. We develop techniques that; for each time interval; are ableto find paths with non-dominated lowest costs while taking the users' risk preferences intoaccount. We represent risk by means of utility function categories and show how the use …,The VLDB Journal,2018,2
Using Incomplete Information for Complete Weight Annotation of Road Networks--Extended Version,Bin Yang; Manohar Kaul; Christian S Jensen,Abstract: We are witnessing increasing interests in the effective use of road networks. Forexample; to enable effective vehicle routing; weighted-graph models of transportationnetworks are used; where the weight of an edge captures some cost associated withtraversing the edge; eg; greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or travel time. It is a preconditionto using a graph model for routing that all edges have weights. Weights that capture traveltimes and GHG emissions can be extracted from GPS trajectory data collected from thenetwork. However; GPS trajectory data typically lack the coverage needed to assign weightsto all edges. This paper formulates and addresses the problem of annotating all edges in aroad network with travel cost based weights from a set of trips in the network that cover onlya small fraction of the edges; each with an associated ground-truth travel cost. A general …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1308.0484,2013,2
Efficient approximate similarity search using random projection learning,Peisen Yuan; Chaofeng Sha; Xiaoling Wang; Bin Yang; Aoying Zhou,Abstract Efficient similarity search on high dimensional data is an important research topic indatabase and information retrieval fields. In this paper; we propose a random projectionlearning approach for solving the approximate similarity search problem. First; the randomprojection technique of the locality sensitive hashing is applied for generating the highquality binary codes. Then the binary code is treated as the labels and a group of SVMclassifiers are trained with the labeled data for predicting the binary code for the similarityqueries. The experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our method substantiallyoutperforms the existing work in terms of preprocessing time and query processing.,Web-Age Information Management,2011,2

Learning to Route with Sparse Trajectory Sets---Extended Version,Chenjuan Guo; Bin Yang; Jilin Hu; Christian S Jensen,Abstract: Motivated by the increasing availability of vehicle trajectory data; we propose learn-to-route; a comprehensive trajectory-based routing solution. Specifically; we first construct agraph-like structure from trajectories as the routing infrastructure. Second; we enabletrajectory-based routing given an arbitrary (source; destination) pair. In the first step; given aroad network and a collection of trajectories; we propose a trajectory-based clusteringmethod that identifies regions in a road network. If a pair of regions are connected bytrajectories; we maintain the paths used by these trajectories and learn a routing preferencefor travel between the regions. As trajectories are skewed and sparse; many region pairs arenot connected by trajectories. We thus transfer routing preferences from region pairs withsufficient trajectories to such region pairs and then use the transferred preferences to …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.07980,2018,*
Finding Top-k Optimal Sequenced Routes--Full Version,Huiping Liu; Cheqing Jin; Bin Yang; Aoying Zhou,Abstract: Motivated by many practical applications in logistics and mobility-as-a-service; westudy the top-k optimal sequenced routes (KOSR) querying on large; general graphs wherethe edge weights may not satisfy the triangle inequality; eg; road network graphs with traveltimes as edge weights. The KOSR querying strives to find the top-k optimal routes (ie; withthe top-k minimal total costs) from a given source to a given destination; which must visit anumber of vertices with specific vertex categories (eg; gas stations; restaurants; andshopping malls) in a particular order (eg; visiting gas stations before restaurants and thenshopping malls). To efficiently find the top-k optimal sequenced routes; we propose twoalgorithms PruningKOSR and StarKOSR. In PruningKOSR; we define a dominancerelationship between two partially-explored routes.

Assessing the Accuracy Benefits of On-the-Fly Trajectory Selection in Fine-Grained Travel-Time Estimation,Robert Waury; Jilin Hu; Bin Yang; Christian S Jensen,Today's one-size-fits-all approach to travel-time computation in spatial networks proceeds intwo steps. In a preparatory off-line step; a set of distributions; eg; one per hour of the day; iscomputed for each network segment. Then; when a path and a departure time are provided;a distribution for the path is computed on-line from pertinent pre-computed distributions.Motivated by the availability of massive trajectory data from vehicles; we propose acompletely on-line approach; where distributions are computed from trajectories on-the-fly;ie; when a query arrives. This new approach makes it possible to use arbitrary sets ofunderlying trajectories for a query. Specifically; we study the potential for accuracyimprovements over the one-size-fits-all approach that can be obtained using the on-the-flyapproach and report findings from an empirical study that suggest that the on-the-fly …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2017 18th IEEE International Conference on,2017,*
