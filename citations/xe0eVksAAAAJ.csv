Simplification envelopes,Jonathan Cohen; Amitabh Varshney; Dinesh Manocha; Greg Turk; Hans Weber; Pankaj Agarwal; Frederick Brooks; William Wright,Abstract We propose the idea of simplification envelopes for generating a hierarchy of level-of-detail approximations for a given polygonal model. Our approach guarantees that allpoints of an approximation are within a user-specifiable distance from the original modeland that all points of the original model are within a distance from the approximation.Simplification envelopes provide a general framework within which a large collection ofexisting simplification algorithms can run. We demonstrate this technique in conjunction withtwo algorithms; one local; the other global. The local algorithm provides a fast method forgenerating approximations to large input meshes (at least hundreds of thousands oftriangles). The global algorithm provides the opportunity to avoid local “minima” andpossibly achieve better simplifications as a result. Each approximation attempts to …,Proceedings of the 23rd annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques,1996,805

Indexing moving points,Pankaj K Agarwal; Lars Arge; Jeff Erickson,Abstract We propose three indexing schemes for storing a set S of N points in the plane;each moving along a linear trajectory; so that any query of the following form can beanswered quickly: Given a rectangle R and a real value t; report all K points of S that lieinside R at time t. We first present an indexing structure that; for any given constant ε> 0;uses O (N/B) disk blocks and answers a query in O ((N/B) 1/2+ ε+ K/B) I/Os; where B is theblock size. It can also report all the points of S that lie inside R during a given time interval. Apoint can be inserted or deleted; or the trajectory of a point can be changed; in O (log B 2 N)I/Os. Next; we present a general approach that improves the query time if the queries arrivein chronological order; by allowing the index to evolve over time. We obtain a tradeoffbetween the query time and the number of times the index needs to be updated as the …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2003,404
A Monte Carlo algorithm for fast projective clustering,Cecilia M Procopiuc; Michael Jones; Pankaj K Agarwal; TM Murali,Abstract We propose a mathematical formulation for the notion of optimal projective cluster;starting from natural requirements on the density of points in subspaces. This allows us todevelop a Monte Carlo algorithm for iteratively computing projective clusters. We prove thatthe computed clusters are good with high probability. We implemented a modified version ofthe algorithm; using heuristics to speed up computation. Our extensive experiments showthat our method is significantly more accurate than previous approaches. In particular; weuse our techniques to build a classifier for detecting rotated human faces in clutteredimages.,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,399

Geometric approximation via coresets,Pankaj K Agarwal; Sariel Har-Peled; Kasturi R Varadarajan,Abstract. The paradigm of coresets has recently emerged as a powerful tool for efficientlyapproximating various extent measures of a point set P. Using this paradigm; one quicklycomputes a small subset Q of P; called a coreset; that approximates the original set P andand then solves the problem on Q using a relatively inefficient algorithm. The solution for Qis then translated to an approximate solution to the original point set P.

Range Searching.,Pankaj K Agarwal,Abstract: Range searching is one of the central problems in computational geometry;because it arises in many applications and a wide variety of geometric problems can beformulated as a range-searching problem. Range counting and range reporting are just twoinstances of range-searching queries. Typically; the canonical subsets are organized in atree-like data structure; each of whose node V is associated with a canonical subset A; Vstores the weight w (A) and some auxiliary information. A query is answered by searchingthe tree in a top-down fashion; using the auxiliary information to guide the search.Descriptors:* MATHEMATICAL MODELS; ALGORITHMS; DATA MANAGEMENT; LINEARPROGRAMMING; INPUT OUTPUT PROCESSING; ALGEBRAIC TOPOLOGY; RANGEFINDING; ORTHOGONALITY; PLANE GEOMETRY.,*,1996,186
Resolving the biodiversity paradox,James S Clark; Mike Dietze; Sukhendu Chakraborty; Pankaj K Agarwal; Ines Ibanez; Shannon LaDeau; Mike Wolosin,Abstract The paradox of biodiversity involves three elements;(i) mathematical models predictthat species must differ in specific ways in order to coexist as stable ecologicalcommunities;(ii) such differences are difficult to identify; yet (iii) there is widespread evidenceof stability in natural communities. Debate has centred on two views. The first explanationinvolves tradeoffs along a small number of axes; including 'colonization-competition';resource competition (light; water; nitrogen for plants; including the 'successional niche');and life history (eg high-light growth vs. low-light survival and few large vs. many smallseeds). The second view is neutrality; which assumes that species differences do notcontribute to dynamics. Clark et al.(2004) presented a third explanation; that coexistence isinherently high dimensional; but still depends on species differences. We demonstrate …,Ecology Letters,2007,166
The resilience of WDM networks to probabilistic geographical failures,Pankaj K Agarwal; Alon Efrat; Shashidhara K Ganjugunte; David Hay; Swaminathan Sankararaman; Gil Zussman,Telecommunications networks; and in particular optical WDM networks; are vulnerable tolarge-scale failures in their physical infrastructure; resulting from physical attacks (such asan electromagnetic pulse attack) or natural disasters (such as solar flares; earthquakes; andfloods). Such events happen at specific geographical locations and disrupt specific parts ofthe network; but their effects cannot be determined exactly in advance. Therefore; weprovide a unified framework to model network vulnerability when the event has aprobabilistic nature; defined by an arbitrary probability density function. Our frameworkcaptures scenarios with a number of simultaneous attacks; when network componentsconsist of several dependent subcomponents; and in which either a 1+ 1 or a 1: 1 protectionplan is in place.

Constructing levels in arrangements and higher order Voronoi diagrams,Pankaj K Agarwal; Mark De Berg; Jirí Matousek; Otfried Schwarzkopf,We give simple randomized incremental algorithms for computing the Amk-level in anarrangement of n lines in the plane or in an arrangement of n planes in \Reals^3. Theexpected running time of our algorithms is O(nk+nα(n)\logn) for the planarcase and O (nk2+n log3n) for the three-dimensional case. Both bounds are optimal unless k is very small. Thealgorithm generalizes to computing the Amk-level in an arrangement of discs or x-monotoneJordan curves in the plane. Our approach can also compute the k-level; this yields arandomized algorithm for computing the order-k Voronoi diagram of n points in the plane inexpected time O (k (nk) log n+ n log3n).,SIAM journal on computing,1998,142

On linear time minor tests with depth-first search,Hans L.  Bodlaender,Abstract Recent results on graph minors make it desirable to have efficient algorithms that;for a fixed set of graphs {H 1;...; H c}; test whether a given graph G contains at least onegraph H i as a minor. In this paper we show the following result: if at least one graph H i; is aminor of a 2× k grid graph; and at least one graph H i is a minor of a circus graph; then onecan test in O (n) time whether a given graph G contains at least one graph H∈{H 1;...; H c}as a minor. This result generalizes a result of Fellows and Langston. The algorithm is basedon depth-first search and on dynamic programming on graphs with bounded treewidth. As acorollary; it follows that the MAXIMUM LEAF SPANNING TREE problem can be solved inlinear time for fixed k.

Deformable free-space tilings for kinetic collision detection,Pankaj K Agarwal; Julien Basch; Leonidas J Guibas; John Hershberger; Li Zhang,We present kinetic data structures for detecting collisions between a set of polygons that aremoving continuously. Unlike classical collision detection methods that rely on boundingvolume hierarchies; our method is based on deformable tilings of the free space surroundingthe polygons. The basic shape of our tiles is that of a pseudo-triangle; a shape sufficientlyflexible to allow extensive deformation; yet structured enough to make detection of self-collisions easy. We show different schemes for maintaining pseudo-triangulations as akinetic data structure; and we analyze their performance. Specifically; we first describe analgorithm for maintaining a pseudo-triangulation of a point set; and show that the pseudo-triangulation changes only quadratically many times if points move along algebraic arcs ofconstant degree. In addition; by refining the pseudo-triangulation; we show triangulations …,The International Journal of Robotics Research,2002,130

Near-linear time approximation algorithms for curve simplification,Pankaj K Agarwal; Sariel Har-Peled; Nabil H Mustafa; Yusu Wang,Abstract We consider the problem of approximating a polygonal curve P under a given errorcriterion by another polygonal curve P'whose vertices are a subset of the vertices of P. Thegoal is to minimize the number of vertices of P'while ensuring that the error between P'and Pis below a certain threshold. We consider two different error measures: Hausdorff andFrechet. For both error criteria; we present near-linear time approximation algorithms that;given a parameter ε> 0; compute a simplified polygonal curve P'whose error is less than εand size at most the size of an optimal simplified polygonal curve with error ε/2.

Inferring pathways from gene lists using a literature-derived network of biological relationships,Dilip Rajagopalan; Pankaj Agarwal,Abstract Motivation: A number of omic technologies such as transcriptional profiling;proteomics; literature searches; genetic association; etc. help in the identification of sets ofimportant genes. A subset of these genes may act in a coordinated manner; possiblybecause they are part of the same biological pathway. Interpreting such gene lists andrelating them to pathways is a challenging task. Databases of biological relationshipsbetween thousands of mammalian genes can help in deciphering omics data. Therelationships between genes can be assembled into a biological network with each proteinas a node and each relationship as an edge between two proteins (or nodes). This networkmay then be searched for subnetworks consisting largely of interesting genes from the omicsexperiment. The subset of genes in the subnetwork along with the web of relationships …,Bioinformatics,2004,119

Motion planning for a steering-constrained robot through moderate obstacles,Pankaj K Agarwal; Prabhakar Raghavan; Hisao Tamaki,Abstract Most mobile robots use steering mechanisms to guide their motion. Suchmechanisms have stops that constrain the rate at which the robot can change its direction.We study apoint robot in the plane subject to such constraints; in the presence of a class ofobstacles we call moderate obstacles. We consider the case in which the robot has areverse gear that allows it to back up; as well asthe case when it does not; All our algorithmsrun in polynomial time and produce paths whose lengths are either optimal or within anadditive constant of optimal.,Proceedings of the twenty-seventh annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,1995,105
Bkd-tree: A dynamic scalable kd-tree,Octavian Procopiuc; Pankaj K Agarwal; Lars Arge; Jeffrey Scott Vitter,Abstract In this paper we propose a new index structure; called the Bkd-tree; for indexinglarge multi-dimensional point data sets. The Bkd-tree is an I/O-efficient dynamic datastructure based on the kd-tree. We present the results of an extensive experimental studyshowing that unlike previous attempts on making external versions of the kd-tree dynamic;the Bkd-tree maintains its high space utilization and excellent query and updateperformance regardless of the number of updates performed on it.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2003,104
Ray shooting and other applications of spanning trees with low stabbing number,Pankaj K Agarwal,This paper considers the following problem: Given a set G of n (possibly intersecting) linesegments in the plane; preprocess it so that; given a query ray ρ emanating from a point p;one can quickly compute the intersection point Φ(G;ρ) of ρ with a segment of G that liesnearest to p. The paper presents an algorithm that preprocesses G; in time O(n^3/2\log^ωn);into a data structure of size O(nα(n)\log^4n); so that for a query ray ρ; Φ(G;ρ) can becomputed in time O(nα(n)\log^2n); where ω is a constant <4.33 and α(n) is a functionalinverse of Ackermann's function. If the given segments are nonintersecting; the storage goesdown to O(n\log^3n) and the query time becomes O(\sqrtn\log^2n). The main tool used isspanning trees (on the set of segment endpoints) with low stabbing number; ie; with theproperty that no line intersects more than O(\sqrtn) edges of the tree. Such trees make it …,SIAM Journal on Computing,1992,101
Efficient searching with linear constraints,Pankaj K Agarwal; Lars Arge; Jeff Erickson; Paulo G Franciosa; Jeffrey Scott Vitter,Abstract We show how to preprocess a set S of points in R d into an external memory datastructure that efficiently supports linear-constraint queries. Each query is in the form of alinear constraint xd⩽ a 0+∑ d− 1 i= 1 aixi; the data structure must report all the points of Sthat satisfy the constraint. This problem is called halfspace range searching in thecomputational geometry literature. Our goal is to minimize the number of disk blocksrequired to store the data structure and the number of disk accesses (I/Os) required toanswer a query. For d= 2; we present the first data structure that uses linear space andanswers linear-constraint queries using an optimal number of I/Os in the worst case. For d=3; we present a near-linear-size data structure that answers queries using an optimalnumber of I/Os on the average. We present linear-size data structures that can answer d …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2000,100
Efficient algorithms for approximating polygonal chains,Pankaj K Agarwal; Kasturi R Varadarajan,Abstract. We consider the problem of approximating a polygonal chain C by anotherpolygonal chain C'whose vertices are constrained to be a subset of the set of vertices of C.The goal is to minimize the number of vertices needed in the approximation C'.

Vertical decomposition of shallow levels in 3-dimensional arrangements and its applications,Pankaj K Agarwal; Alon Efrat; Micha Sharir,Let \calF be a collection of n bivariate algebraic functions of constant maximum degree. Weshow that the combinatorial complexity of the vertical decomposition of the (≤k)-level of thearrangement \A(\calF) is O(k^3+εψ(n/k)) for any ε>0; where ψ(r) is the maximum complexityof the lower envelope of a subset of at most r functions of \calF.

Performance investigation of neural-network-based unified power-quality conditioner,Vadirajacharya G Kinhal; Promod Agarwal; Hari Oam Gupta,The application of artificial intelligence is growing fast in the area of power electronics anddrives. The artificial neural network (ANN) is considered as a new tool to design controlcircuitry for power-quality (PQ) devices. In this paper; the ANN-based controller is designedfor the current control of the shunt active power filter and trained offline using data from theconventional proportional-integral controller. A digital-signal-processor-basedmicrocontroller is used for the real-time simulation and implementation of the controlalgorithm. An exhaustive simulation study is carried out to investigate the performance of theANN controller and compare its performance with the conventional PI controller results. Thesystem performance is also verified experimentally on a prototype model developed in thelaboratory.,IEEE transactions on power delivery,2011,86
Box-trees and R-trees with near-optimal query time,M Hammar; HJ Haverkort,Abstract A box-tree is a bounding-volume hierarchy that uses axis-aligned boxes asbounding volumes. The query complexity of a box-tree with respect to a given type of queryis the maximum number of nodes visited when answering such a query. We describeseveral new algorithms for constructing box-trees with small worst-case query complexitywith respect to queries with axis-parallel boxes and with points. We also prove lower boundson the worst-case query complexity for box-trees; which show that our results are optimal orclose to optimal. Finally; we present algorithms to convert box-trees to R-trees; resulting in R-trees with (almost) optimal query complexity.,Discrete & Computational Geometry,2002,85

We present a randomized algorithm that computes thevertices; edges; and 2-faces of the lower envelope (ie; pointwise minimum) of \calF inexpected time O(n^d+ϵ) for any ϵ>0.

A deterministic versionof our procedure runs in time &Ogr;(n 3/2 log 5/2 n). Both versions improve the previouslybest known upper bound of &Ogr;(n 9/5 log 4/5 n) by Chazelle [Ch]. A simple &Ogr;(n log n)time algorithm for computing an approximation of the median distance is also presented.,Proceedings of the sixth annual symposium on Computational geometry,1990,85
K-means projective clustering,Pankaj K Agarwal; Nabil H Mustafa,Abstract In many applications it is desirable to cluster high dimensional data along varioussubspaces; which we refer to as projective clustering. We propose a new objective functionfor projective clustering; taking into account the inherent trade-off between the dimension ofa subspace and the induced clustering error. We then present an extension of the k-meansclustering algorithm for projective clustering in arbitrary subspaces; and also proposetechniques to avoid local minima. Unlike previous algorithms; ours can choose thedimension of each cluster independently and automatically. Furthermore; experimentalresults show that our algorithm is significantly more accurate than the previous approaches.,Proceedings of the twenty-third ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2004,83

Star unfolding of a polytope with applications,Pankaj K Agarwal; Boris Aronov; Joseph O'Rourke; Catherine A Schevon,We introduce the notion of a star unfolding of the surface \calP of a three-dimensionalconvex polytope with n vertices; and use it to solve several problems related to shortestpaths on \calP. The first algorithm computes the edge sequences traversed by shortest pathson \calP in time O(n^6β(n)\logn); where β(n) is an extremely slowly growing function. A muchsimpler O(n^6) time algorithm that finds a small superset of all such edge sequences is alsosketched. The second algorithm is an O(n^8\logn) time procedure for computing thegeodesic diameter of \calP: the maximum possible separation of two points on \calP with thedistance measured along \calP. Finally; we describe an algorithm that preprocesses \calPinto a data structure that can efficiently answer the queries of the following form:" Given twopoints; what is the length of the shortest path connecting them?"

Indexing uncertain data,Pankaj K Agarwal; Siu-Wing Cheng; Yufei Tao; Ke Yi,Abstract Querying uncertain data has emerged as an important problem in datamanagement due to the imprecise nature of many measurement data. In this paper we studyanswering range queries over uncertain data. Specifically; we are given a collection P of npoints in R; each represented by its one-dimensional probability density function (pdf). Thegoal is to build an index on P such that given a query interval I and a probability threshold τ;we can quickly report all points of P that lie in I with probability at least τ. We present variousindexing schemes with linear or near-linear space and logarithmic query time. Our schemessupport pdf's that are either histograms or more complex ones such as Gaussian orpiecewise algebraic. They also extend to the external memory model in which the goal is tominimize the number of disk accesses when querying the index.,Proceedings of the twenty-eighth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2009,80
Mergeable summaries,Pankaj K Agarwal; Graham Cormode; Zengfeng Huang; Jeff M Phillips; Zhewei Wei; Ke Yi,Abstract We study the mergeability of data summaries. Informally speaking; mergeabilityrequires that; given two summaries on two datasets; there is a way to merge the twosummaries into a single summary on the two datasets combined together; while preservingthe error and size guarantees. This property means that the summaries can be merged in away akin to other algebraic operators such as sum and max; which is especially useful forcomputing summaries on massive distributed data. Several data summaries are triviallymergeable by construction; most notably all the sketches that are linear functions of thedatasets. But some other fundamental ones; like those for heavy hitters and quantiles; arenot (known to be) mergeable. In this article; we demonstrate that these summaries areindeed mergeable or can be made mergeable after appropriate modifications …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2013,79
Lenses in arrangements of pseudo-circles and their applications,Pankaj K Agarwal; Eran Nevo; János Pach; Rom Pinchasi; Micha Sharir; Shakhar Smorodinsky,Abstract A collection of simple closed Jordan curves in the plane is called a family of pseudo-circles if any two of its members intersect at most twice. A closed curve composed of twosubarcs of distinct pseudo-circles is said to be an empty lens if the closed Jordan region thatit bounds does not intersect any other member of the family. We establish a linear upperbound on the number of empty lenses in an arrangement of n pseudo-circles with theproperty that any two curves intersect precisely twice. We use this bound to show that anycollection of n x-monotone pseudo-circles can be cut into O (n 8/5) arcs so that any twointersect at most once; this improves a previous bound of O (n 5/3) due to Tamaki andTokuyama. If; in addition; the given collection admits an algebraic representation by threereal parameters that satisfies some simple conditions; then the number of cuts can be …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2004,79
Approximation algorithms for curvature-constrained shortest paths,Pankaj K Agarwal; Hongyan Wang,Let B be a point robot in the plane; whose path is constrained to have curvature of at most 1;and let Ω be a set of polygonal obstacles with n vertices. We study the collision-free; optimalpath-planning problem for B. Given a parameter ε; we present an O((n^2/\eps^4)\logn)-timealgorithm for computing a collision-free; curvature-constrained path between two givenpositions; whose length is at most (1+ε) times the length of an optimal path; provided it isrobust.(Roughly speaking; a path is robust if it remains collision-free even if certain positionson the path are perturbed). Our algorithm thus runs significantly faster than the previouslybest known algorithm by Jacobs and Canny whose running time is O((n+L\eps^2)^2+n^2(n+L\eps^2)\logn); where L is the total edge length of the obstacles. More importantly; therunning time of our algorithm does not depend on the size of obstacles. The path returned …,SIAM Journal on Computing,2001,79

We describe TERRASTREAM; a"pipelined" solution that consists of four main stages: construction of a digital elevation model(DEM); hydrological conditioning; extraction of river networks; and construction of awatershed hierarchy. Our approach has several advantages over existing methods. First; wedesign and implement the pipeline so that each stage is scalable to massive data sets; asingle non-scalable stage would create a bottleneck and limit overall scalability.

Thediscrete Fréchet distance replaces the dog and its owner by a pair of frogs that can onlyreside on m and n specific stones; respectively. The stones are in fact sequences of points;typically sampled from the respective curves f and g.

Nearest-neighbor searching under uncertainty ii,Pankaj K Agarwal; Boris Aronov; Sariel Har-Peled; Jeff M Phillips; Ke Yi; Wuzhou Zhang,Abstract Nearest-neighbor search; which returns the nearest neighbor of a query point in aset of points; is an important and widely studied problem in many fields; and it has a widerange of applications. In many of them; such as sensor databases; location-based services;face recognition; and mobile data; the location of data is imprecise. We therefore studynearest-neighbor queries in a probabilistic framework in which the location of each inputpoint is specified as a probability distribution function. We present efficient algorithms for (i)computing all points that are nearest neighbors of a query point with nonzero probability and(ii) estimating the probability of a point being the nearest neighbor of a query point; eitherexactly or within a specified additive error.,ACM Transactions on Algorithms (TALG),2016,71

Davenport–Schinzel sequences and their geometric applications,Pankaj K Agarwal; Micha Sharir,Abstract An (n; s) Davenport–Schinzel sequence; for positive integers n and s; is a sequencecomposed of n distinct symbols with the properties that no two adjacent elements are equal;and that it does not contain; as a (possibly non-contiguous) subsequence; any alternationa⋯ b⋯ a⋯ b⋯ a⋯ b⋯ a⋯ b⋯ of length s+ 2 between two distinct symbols a and b. The closerelationship between Davenport–Schinzel sequences and the combinatorial structure oflower envelopes of collections of functions make the sequences very attractive because avariety of geometric problems can be formulated in terms of lower envelopes. A near-linearbound on the maximum length of Davenport–Schinzel sequences enable us to derive sharpbounds on the combinatorial structure underlying various geometric problems; which in turnyields efficient algorithms for these problems.,*,2000,70

We first describe a data structure for maintaining the smallestorthogonal rectangle containing the point set. We then use this data structure to maintain theapproximate diameter; smallest enclosing disk; width; and smallest area or perimeterbounding rectangle of a set of moving points in R 2 so that the number of events is only aconstant. This contrasts with &OHgr;(n 2) events that data structures for the maintenance ofthose exact properties have to handle.,Proceedings of the twelfth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms,2001,68
Cylindrical static and kinetic binary space partitions,Pankaj K Agarwal; Leonidas J Guibas; TM Murali; Jeffrey Scott Vitter,Abstract We describe the first known algorithm for efficiently maintaining a Binary SpacePartition (BSP) for n continuously moving segments in the plane; whose interiors remaindisjoint throughout the motion. Under reasonable assumptions on the motion; we show thatthe total number of times this BSP changes is O (n 2); and that we can update the BSP in O(log n) expected time per change. Throughout the motion; the expected size of the BSP is O(n log n). We also consider the problem of constructing a BSP for n static triangles withpairwise-disjoint interiors in R 3. We present a randomized algorithm that constructs a BSPof size O (n 2) in O (n 2 log 2 n) expected time.

I/O-efficient algorithms for contour-line extraction and planar graph blocking,Pankaj K Agarwal; Lars Arge; TM Murali; Kasturi R Varadarajan; Jeffrey Scott Vitter,Abstract For a polyhedral terrain E; the contour at z-coordinate ft; denoted Ch; is defined tobe the intersection of the plane z= h with S. In this paper; we study the contour-line extractionproblem; where we want to preprocess E into a data structure so that given a query z-coordinate h; we can report Ch quickly. This is a central problem that arises in geographicinformation systems (GIS); where terrains are often stored as Triangular Irregular Networks(TINs). We present an I/O-optimal algorithm for this problem which stores a terrain£ with TVvertices using O (N/B) blocks; where B is the size of a disk block; so that for any query h; thecontour Ch can be computed using O (logs N+\Ch\/B) I/O operations; where\Ch\denotes thesize of Ch-We also present an improved algorithm for a more general problem of blockingbounded-degree planar graphs such as TINs (ie; storing them on disk so that any graph …,SODA,1998,66

Several efficient algorithmsare presented for detecting an intersection between an arc of \bfΓ and an arc of \bfΓ^′.(i) Ifthe arcs of \bfΓ^′ form the boundary of a simply connected region; then the following can bedetected: a “red-blue” intersection in time O(λ_s(m)\log^2m+(λ_s(m)+n)\log(n+m)) whereλ_s(m) is the (almost-linear) maximum length of (m;s) Davenport–Schinzel sequences; andwhere s is a fixed parameter; depending on the shape of the given arcs. Another case wherean intersection in close to linear time can be detected is when the union of the arcs of \bfΓand the union of the arcs of \bfΓ^′ are both connected.(ii) In the most general case; anintersection in time O((mλ_s(n)+nλ_s(m))\log^1.5(m+n)) can be detected.

Streaming geometric optimization using graphics hardware,Pankaj K Agarwal; Shankar Krishnan; Nabil H Mustafa; Suresh Venkatasubramanian,Abstract In this paper we propose algorithms for solving a variety of geometric optimizationproblems on a stream of points in ℝ 2 or ℝ 3. These problems include various extentmeasures (eg diameter; width; smallest enclosing disk); collision detection (penetrationdepth and distance between polytopes); and shape fitting (minimum width annulus;circle/line fitting). The main contribution of this paper is a unified approach to solving all ofthe above problems efficiently using modern graphics hardware. All the above problems canbe approximated using a constant number of passes over the data stream. Our algorithmsare easily implemented; and our empirical study demonstrates that the running times of ourprograms are comparable to the best implementations for the above problems. Anothersignificant property of our results is that although the best known implementations for the …,European Symposium on Algorithms,2003,64
Vertical decomposition of shallow levels in 3-dimensional arrangements and its applications,Pankaj K Agarwal; Alon Efrat; Micha Sharir,Let 3 be a collection of n bivariate algebraic functions of constant maximum degree.

Can visibility graphs be represented compactly?,Pankaj K Agarwal; Noga Alon; Boris Aronov; Subhash Suri,Abstract We consider the problem of representing the visibility graph of line segments as aunion of cliques and bipartite cliques. Given a graph G; a family G={G 1; G 2;...; G k} is calleda clique cover of G if (i) each G i is a clique or a bipartite clique; and (ii) the union of G i is G.The size of the clique cover G is defined as∑ i= 1 kni; where ni is the number of vertices in Gi. Our main result is that there are visibility graphs of n nonintersecting line segments in theplane whose smallest clique cover has size Ω (n 2/log 2 n). An upper bound of O (n 2/log n)on the clique cover follows from a well-known result in extremal graph theory. On the otherhand; we show that the visibility graph of a simple polygon always admits a clique cover ofsize O (n log 3 n); and that there are simple polygons whose visibility graphs require a cliquecover of size Ω (n log n).,Discrete & Computational Geometry,1994,63
Pipes; cigars; and kreplach: The union of Minkowski sums in three dimensions,Pankaj K Agarwal; Micha Sharir,Abstract. Let Ω be a set of pairwise-disjoint polyhedral obstacles in R 3 with a total of nvertices; and let B be a ball in R 3. We show that the combinatorial complexity of the freeconfiguration space F of B amid Ω:; ie;(the closure of) the set of all placements of B at whichB does not intersect any obstacle; is O (n 2+ ε); for any ε> 0; the constant of proportionalitydepends on ε. This upper bound almost matches the known quadratic lower bound on themaximum possible complexity of F. The special case in which Ω is a set of lines is studiedseparately. We also present a few extensions of this result; including a randomizedalgorithm for computing the boundary of F whose expected running time is O (n 2+ ε).,Discrete & Computational Geometry,2000,61
Processing a large number of continuous preference top-k queries,Albert Yu; Pankaj K Agarwal; Jun Yang,Abstract Given a set of objects; each with multiple numeric attributes; a (preference) top-kquery retrieves the k objects with the highest scores according to a user preference; definedas a linear combination of attribute values. We consider the problem of processing a largenumber of continuous top-k queries; each with its own preference. When objects or userpreferences change; the query results must be updated. We present a dynamic index thatsupports the reverse top k query; which is of independent interest. Combining this index withanother one for top-k queries; we develop a scalable solution for processing manycontinuous top-k queries that exploits the clusteredness in user preferences. We also definean approximate version of the problem and present a solution significantly more efficientthan the exact one with little loss in accuracy.,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD international conference on management of data,2012,58

The combinatorial complexity of the unionU (C) of C is the total number of faces of all dimensions; of the arrangement of theboundaries of the objects; which lie on its boundary. We survey the known upper bounds onthe complexity of the union of n geometric objects satisfying various natural conditions.These problems play a central role in the design and analysis of many geometric algorithmsarising in robotics; molecular modeling; solid modeling; and shape matching; and thetechniques used for their solutions are interesting in their own right.,Computational Geometry: Twenty Years Later,2007,55
Practical methods for shape fitting and kinetic data structures using coresets,Hai Yu; Pankaj K Agarwal; Raghunath Poreddy; Kasturi R Varadarajan,Abstract The notion of ε-kernel was introduced by Agarwal et al.(J. ACM 51: 606–635; 2004)to set up a unified framework for computing various extent measures of a point set Papproximately. Roughly speaking; a subset Q⊆ P is an ε-kernel of P if for every slab Wcontaining Q; the expanded slab (1+ ε) W contains P. They illustrated the significance of ε-kernel by showing that it yields approximation algorithms for a wide range of geometricoptimization problems. We present a simpler and more practical algorithm for computing theε-kernel of a set P of points in ℝ d. We demonstrate the practicality of our algorithm byshowing its empirical performance on various inputs. We then describe an incrementalalgorithm for fitting various shapes and use the ideas of our algorithm for computing ε-kernels to analyze the performance of this algorithm.

A depth order of K; if it exists;is a linear order< of the objects in K such that if K; L ϵ K and K lies vertically below L then K<L. We present a new technique for computing depth orders; and apply it to several specialclasses of objects. Our results include:(i) If K is a set of n triangles whose xy-projections areall 'fat'; then a depth order for K can be computed in time O (n log 5 n).(ii) If K is a set of nconvex and simply-shaped objects whose xy-projections are all 'fat'and their sizes are withina constant ratio from one another; then a depth order for K can be computed in time O (nλ s 12 (n) log 4 n); where s is the maximum number of intersections between the boundaries ofthe xy-projections of any pair of objects in K; and λ s (n) is the maximum length of (n; s)Davenport-Schinzel sequences.,Computational Geometry,1995,53
CRB-tree: An efficient indexing scheme for range-aggregate queries,Sathish Govindarajan; Pankaj K Agarwal; Lars Arge,Abstract We propose a new indexing scheme; called the CRB-tree; for efficiently answeringrange-aggregate queries. The range-aggregate problem is defined as follows: Given a set ofweighted points in R d; compute the aggregate of weights of points that lie inside ad-dimensional query rectangle. In this paper we focus on range-COUNT; SUM; AVGaggregates. First; we develop an indexing scheme for answering two-dimensional range-COUNT queries that uses O (N/B) disk blocks and answers a query in O (log NB) I/O s;where N is the number of input points and B is the disk block size. This is the first optimalindex structure for the 2D range-COUNT problem. The index can be extended to obtain anear-linear-size structure for answering range-SUM queries using O (log NB) I/O s.

Approximation and exact algorithms for minimum-width annuli and shells,Pankaj K Agarwal; Boris Aronov; Sariel Har-Peled; Micha Sharir,Let S be a set of n points in Rd. The “roundness” of S can be measured by computing thewidth w'(S) of the thinnest spherical shell (or annulus in R') that contains S. This papercontains four main results related to computing w*(S):(i) For d= 2; we can compute in O (nlog n) time an annulus containing S whose width is at most 2w'(S).(ii) For d= 2 we cancompute; for any given parameter e> 0; an annulus containing S whose width is at most (1+c) w*(S); in time O (nlogn+ n/s').(iii) For d> 3; given a parameter c> 0; we can compute a shellcontaining S of width at most (1+ s) w*(S) in time 0 (ffdog($ g)) or 0 (($+?

The recent work of Arora 2] gives a Monte-Carlo algorithm forthis problem that with probability at least 1= 2 returns a solution that is within (1+") of theoptimal; the running time of the algorithm is O (nlogO (1=") n). We present a Monte-Carloalgorithm that also returns; with probability at least 1= 2; a solution with (1+") of the optimal;the running time of our algorithm is O (nlog6 n=" 3). Thus; the running time of our algorithm ispolynomial in 1=" in contrast to Arora's algorithm.

Detecting non-adjoining correlations with signals in DNA,Pankaj Agarwal; Vineet Bafna,Abstract We describe a general technique for modeling and identifying biological signals;such as the start of protein translation in eukaryotic &A. The usual techniques for thisproblem either assume that each position of the signal is independently distributed; or allowfor limited dependencies among different positions. We provide a statistical model thatgeneralizes earlier methods; and captures all signi&& high-order dependencies amongdifferent base positions. Additionally; re describe two techniques that allow reliableestimation of the signal in-spite of limited data.

Computing approximate shortest paths on convex polytopes,Pankaj K Agarwal; Sariel Har-Peled; Meetesh Karia,Abstract The algorithms for computing a shortest path on a polyhedral surface are slow;complicated; and numerically unstable. We have developed and implemented a robust andefficient algorithm for computing approximate shortest paths on a convex polyhedral surface.Given a convex polyhedral surface P in\reals 3; two points s; t∈ P; and a parameter\eps> 0;it computes a path between s and t on P whose length is at most (1+\eps) times the length ofthe shortest path between those points. It constructs in time O (n/\sqrt\eps) a graph of size O(1/\eps 4); computes a shortest path on this graph; and projects the path onto the surface inO (n/\eps) time; where n is the number of vertices of P. In the postprocessing step we haveadded a heuristic that considerably improves the quality of the resulting path.,Algorithmica,2002,51
A low leakage and SNM free SRAM cell design in deep sub micron CMOS technology,Sanjeev K Jain; Pankaj Agarwal,As the IC process technology scales; the oxide thickness and operating voltage continues todecrease. The gate oxide thickness in recent and future IC process technology hasapproached the limit when direct tunneling causes gate leakage in both on state and offstate of MOSFET transistor operation modes. Also; lower operating voltage will lower thestability of SRAM cell resulting in lower value of static noise margin. In this paper; a novelread'0'static noise margin (SNM) free eight transistors (8T) SRAM cell is proposed thatreduces gate leakage power in the zero state; taking into consideration the fact that inordinary program most of the bits stored in caches are zeros for both the data and instructionstreams.

From point cloud to grid DEM: A scalable approach,Pankaj K Agarwal; Lars Arge; Andrew Danner,Abstract Given a set S of points in ℝ 3 sampled from an elevation function H: ℝ 2→ ℝ; wepresent a scalable algorithm for constructing a grid digital elevation model (DEM). Ouralgorithm consists of three stages: First; we construct a quad tree on S to partition the pointset into a set of non-overlapping segments. Next; for each segment q; we compute the set ofpoints in q and all segments neighboring q. Finally; we interpolate each segmentindependently using points within the segment and its neighboring segments. Data setsacquired by LIDAR and other modern mapping technologies consist of hundreds of millionsof points and are too large to fit in main memory. When processing such massive data sets;the transfer of data between disk and main memory (also called I/O); rather than the CPUtime; becomes the performance bottleneck. We therefore present an I/O-efficient algorithm …,*,2006,50
Kinetic medians and kd-trees,Pankaj K Agarwal; Jie Gao; Leonidas J Guibas,Abstract We propose algorithms for maintaining two variants of kd-trees of a set of movingpoints in the plane. A pseudo kd-tree allows the number of points stored in the two childrento differ by a constant factor. An overlapping kd-tree allows the bounding boxes of twochildren to overlap. We show that both of them support range search operations in O (n1/2+∈) time; where∈ only depends on the approximation precision. As the points move; weuse event-based kinetic data structures to update the tree when necessary. Both treesundergo only a quadratic number of events; which is optimal; and the update cost for eachevent is only polylogarithmic. To maintain the pseudo kd-tree; we develop algorithms forcomputing an approximate median level of a line arrangement; which itself is of greatinterest.

Let w∗ be the smallest value so that S can be covered by k slabs (respectively d-cylinders); each of width (respectively diameter) at most w∗. This paper contains three mainresults:(i) For d= 2; we present a randomized algorithm that computes O (klogk) strips ofwidth at most w∗ that cover S. Its expected running time is O (nk 2 log 4 n) if k 2 logk⩽ n; forlarger values of k; the expected running time is O (n 2/3 k 8/3 log 14/3 n).(ii) For d= 3; a coverof S by O (klogk) slabs of width at most w∗ can be computed in expected time O (n 3/2 k 9/4polylog (n)).(iii) We compute a cover of S⊂ R d by O (dklogk) d-cylinders of diameter at …,Journal of Algorithms,2003,47

I/O-efficient construction of constrained Delaunay triangulations,Pankaj K Agarwal; Lars Arge; Ke Yi,Abstract In this paper; we designed and implemented an I/O-efficient algorithm forconstructing constrained Delaunay triangulations. If the number of constraining segments issmaller than the memory size; our algorithm runs in expected O(NB\rmlog_M/BNB) I/Os fortriangulating N points in the plane; where M is the memory size and B is the disk block size.If there are more constraining segments; the theoretical bound does not hold; but in practicethe performance of our algorithm degrades gracefully.

Collision detection for deforming necklaces,Pankaj Agarwal; Leonidas Guibas; An Nguyen; Daniel Russel; Li Zhang,Abstract In this paper; we propose to study deformable necklaces—flexible chains of balls;called beads; in which only adjacent balls may intersect. Such objects can be used to modelmacro-molecules; muscles; ropes; and other linear objects in the physical world. We exploitthis linearity to develop geometric structures associated with necklaces that are useful forcollision detection in physical simulations. We show how these structures can beimplemented efficiently and maintained under necklace deformation. In particular; we studya bounding volume hierarchy based on spheres which can be used for collision and self-collision detection of deforming and moving necklaces. As our theoretical and experimentalresults show; such a hierarchy is easy to compute and; more importantly; is also easy tomaintain when the necklace deforms. Using this hierarchy; we achieve a collision …,Computational Geometry,2004,46

In order to effectively quantify the impact of metastatic tumor involvement in thespine; accurate segmentation of the vertebra is required. Manual segmentation can beaccurate but involves extensive and time-consuming user interaction. Potential solutions toautomating segmentation of metastatically involved vertebrae are demons deformableimage registration and level set methods. The purpose of this study was to develop asemiautomated method to accurately segment tumor-bearing vertebrae using theaforementioned techniques.

I/O-efficient batched union-find and its applications to terrain analysis,Pankaj K Agarwal; Lars Arge; Ke Yi,Abstract Despite extensive study over the last four decades and numerous applications; noI/O-efficient algorithm is known for the union-find problem. In this paper we present an I/O-efficient algorithm for the batched (off-line) version of the union-find problem. Given anysequence of N union and find operations; where each union operation joins two distinct sets;our algorithm uses O (sort (N))= O (N/Blog M/BN/B) I/Os; where M is the memory size and Bis the disk block size. This bound is asymptotically optimal in the worst case. If there areunion operations that join a set with itself; our algorithm uses O (sort (N)+ mst (N)) I/Os;where mst (N) is the number of I/Os needed to compute the minimum spanning tree of agraph with N edges. We also describe a simple and practical O (sort (N) log (N/M))-I/Oalgorithm for this problem; which we have implemented. We are interested in the union …,Proceedings of the twenty-second annual symposium on Computational geometry,2006,45

We also develop a static structure for the two-dimensionalcase that answers queries in O (log B N+ T/B) memory transfers using O (N log 2 2 N) space.The analysis of the latter structure requires that B= 2 2 c for some non-negative integerconstant c.,Proceedings of the nineteenth annual symposium on Computational geometry,2003,45

In addition; themethod is extended to obtain tight bounds on the maximum number of faces on theboundary of all nonconvex cells in an arrangement of triangles in ℝ 3. We also present asimpler proof of the O (m 2/3 nd/3+ nd− 1) bound on the number of incidences between nhyperplanes in ℝ d and m vertices of their arrangement.,Discrete & Computational Geometry,1992,44
Unit distances in three dimensions,Haim Kaplan; Jiří Matoušek; Zuzana Safernová; Micha Sharir,Abstract We show that the number of unit distances determined by n points in ℝ 3 is O (n3/2); slightly improving the bound of Clarkson; Edelsbrunner; Guibas; Sharir and Welzl [5];established in 1990. The new proof uses the recently introduced polynomial partitioningtechnique of Guth and Katz [12]. While this paper was still in a draft stage; a similar proof ofour main result was posted to the arXiv by Joshua Zahl [28].,Combinatorics; Probability and Computing,2012,43
A framework for index bulk loading and dynamization,Pankaj K Agarwal; Lars Arge; Octavian Procopiuc; Jeffrey Scott Vitter,Abstract In this paper we investigate automated methods for externalizing internal memorydata structures. We consider a class of balanced trees that we call weight-balancedpartitioning trees (or wp-trees) for indexing a set of points in ℝ d. Well-known examples ofwp-trees include k d-trees; BBD-trees; pseudo-quad-trees; and BAR-trees. Given an efficientexternal wp-tree construction algorithm; we present a general framework for automaticallyobtaining a dynamic external data structure. Using this framework together with a newgeneral construction (bulk loading) technique of independent interest; we obtain datastructures with guaranteed good update performance in terms of I/O transfers. Our approachgives considerably improved construction and update I/O bounds for eg external k d-treesand BBD-trees.,International Colloquium on Automata; Languages; and Programming,2001,43

We study the collision-free; optimal path-planning problem for B moving between two conjgurations inside P (aconfiguration specifies both a location and a direction of travel). We present an O (n” log n)time algorithm for determining whethx a collision-t&e path esists for B between two givenconfigurations. If such a path esists; the algorithm returns a shortest one. We provide 3detaikd classification of curvahue-constrained shortest paths inside a convex polygon andprove severaI properties of them; which xe interesting in their own right. Some of theproperties are quite gcned and shed some light on curvature-constrained shortest pathsamid obstacles.,Proceedings of the fourteenth annual symposium on Computational geometry,1998,43
The cell programming language,Pankaj Agarwal,In developmental biology; modeling and simulation play an important role in understandingcellular behavior. This article includes a review of the general models of development thatare based on cellular interaction. Inspired by these models; we suggest a simple language;the Cell Programming Language (CPL); to write computer programs to describe thisdevelopmental behavior. These programs are an estimate of the minimal informationneeded to model realistically such developmental systems. Using these programs; it ispossible to simulate and visualize cell behavior. We have employed CPL to model thefollowing: aggregation in cellular slime mold in response to a chemotactic agent; cellularsegregation and engulfment due to differential adhesion; and precartilage formation invertebrate limbs. We believe CPL is a useful tool for developing; understanding; and …,Artificial Life,1994,43
Range searching in categorical data: Colored range searching on grid,Pankaj K Agarwal; Sathish Govindarajan; S Muthukrishnan,Abstract Range searching; a fundamental problem in numerous applications areas; hasbeen widely studied in computational geometry and spatial databases. Given a set ofgeometric objects; a typical range query asks for reporting all the objects that intersect aquery object. However in many applications; including databases and network routing; inputobjects are partitioned into categories and a query asks for reporting the set of categories ofobjects that intersect a query object. Moreover in many such applications; objects lie on agrid. We abstract the category of an object by associating a color with each object. In thispaper; we present efficient data structures for solving the colored range-searching andcolored point-enclosure problem on U x U grid. Our data structures use near-linear spaceand answer a query in O (log log U+ k) time; where k is the output size. As far as we know …,European Symposium on Algorithms,2002,42
Geometric partitioning and its applications,KP Agarwal,Abstract\indent In this survey paper we review some results related to {\em geometricpartitioning}; ie given a set of objects in ${\bf R}^{d} $; partition the space into few regions sothat each region intersects a small number of objects.

We then discuss several applications of geometric partitioning.,*,1991,42
Approximation algorithms for k-line center,Pankaj K Agarwal; Cecilia M Procopiuc; Kasturi R Varadarajan,Abstract Given a set P of n points in ℝ d and an integer k≥ 1; let w* denote the minimumvalue so that P can be covered by k cylinders of radius at most w*. We describe an algorithmthat; given P and an ɛ> 0; computes k cylinders of radius at most (1+ ɛ) w* that cover P. Therunning time of the algorithm is O (n log n); with the constant of proportionality depending onk; d; and ɛ. We first show that there exists a small “certificate” Q⊆ P; whose size does notdepend on n; such that for any k-cylinders that cover Q; an expansion of these cylinders by afactor of (1+ ɛ) covers P. We then use a well-known scheme based on sampling and iteratedre-weighting for computing the cylinders.,European Symposium on Algorithms,2002,41

Computing the writhing number of a polygonal knot,Pankaj K Agarwal; Herbert Edelsbrunner; Yusu Wang,Abstract The writhing number measures the global geometry of a closed space curve orknot. We show that this measure is related to the average winding number of its Gauss map.Using this relationship; we give an algorithm for computing the writhing number for apolygonal knot with n edges in time roughly proportional to n 1.6. We also implement adifferent; simple algorithm and provide experimental evidence for its practical efficiency.,Discrete & Computational Geometry,2004,40
A simple and efficient algorithm for high-quality line labeling,Alexander Wolff; Lars Knipping; MJ van Kreveld; Tycho Strijk; Pankaj K Agarwal,The interest in algorithms that automatically place labels on maps; graphs; or diagrams hasincreased with the advance in type-setting technology and the amount of information to bevisualized. However; though manually labeling a map is estimated to take fifty percent oftotal map production time (Morrison; 1980); most geographic information systems (GIS) offeronly very basic label-placement features. In practice; a GIS user is still forced to investseveral hours in order to eliminate manually all label-label and label-feature intersections ona map. In this chapter; we suggest an algorithm that labels one of the three classes of mapobjects; namely polygonal chains; such as rivers or streets. Our method is simple andefficient. At the same time; it produces results of high aesthetical quality. It is the first thatfulfills both of the following two requirements: it allows curved labels and runs in O (n2) …,*,2002,40

Symmetric current balancing circuit for multiple DC loads,Sungjin Choi; Pankaj Agarwal; Teahoon Kim; Joonhyun Yang; Baikhee Han,One of the key challenges in driving multiple parallel loads using a single circuit is to ensurethat each load share the same current. Current imbalance occurs because these loads havevarying individual characteristics; which surface due to inevitable deviations in massproduction. Lighting is one representative application where multiple lamps such as LED(light-emitting diode) arrays need some sort of current balancing mechanism. While resistivebalancing technique can be highly inefficient; current balancing using dedicated control ICfor each channel significantly increases the cost and circuit complexity. In this paper; a novelcurrent balancing circuit for multiple DC loads is proposed. A smart combination of aninherent symmetry of circuit and capacitive balancing mechanism enables an efficient andcost-effective current balancing.

Digital predictive feed-forward controller for a DC–DC converter in plasma display panel,Suyong Chae; Byungchul Hyun; Pankaj Agarwal; Woosup Kim; Bohyung Cho,This paper describes a new digital control method to enhance the dynamic performance of adc-dc converter used in plasma display panel (PDP). A simple digital PID compensator withduty ratio feed-forward control is proposed to minimize the output voltage variation while theload current is continuously changing. The duty ratio feed-forward is calculated using noise-free load current information which is predicted by the available video data of the PDP. Noseparate current sensing circuit is required. A small signal z-domain feed-forward model isderived for the performance analysis and controller design. The proposed control method isexperimentally verified on an asymmetrical half bridge dc-dc converter which suppliespower to a 42 in PDP.,IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics,2008,38
The Repeat Pattern Toolkit (RPT): analyzing the structure and evolution of the C. elegans genome.,Pankaj Agarwal,Abstract Over 3.6 million bases of DNA sequence from chromosome III of the C. eleganshave been determined. The availability of this extended region of contiguous sequence hasallowed us to analyze the nature and prevalence of repetitive sequences in the genome of aeukaryotic organism with a high gene density. We have assembled a Repeat Pattern Toolkit(RPT) to analyze the patterns of repeats occurring in DNA. The tools include identifyingsignificant local alignments (utilizing both two-way and three-way alignments); dividing theset of alignments into connected components (signifying repeat families); computingevolutionary distance between repeat family members; constructing minimum spanningtrees from the connected components; and visualizing the evolution of the repeat families.Over 7000 families of repetitive sequences were identified.

Hausdorff distance under translation for points and balls,Pankaj K Agarwal; Sariel Har-Peled; Micha Sharir; Yusu Wang,Abstract We study the shape matching problem under the Hausdorff distance and itsvariants. Specifically; we consider two sets A; B of balls in R d; d= 2; 3; and wish to find atranslation t that minimizes the Hausdorff distance between A+ t; the set of all balls in Ashifted by t; and B. We consider several variants of this problem. First; we extend the notionof Hausdorff distance from sets of points to sets of balls; so that each ball has to be matchedwith the nearest ball in the other set. We also consider the problem in the standard setting;by computing the Hausdorff distance between the unions of the two sets (as point sets).Second; we consider either all possible translates t (as is the standard approach); orconsider only translations that keep the balls of A+ t disjoint from those of B. We proposeseveral exact and approximation algorithms for these problems. Since the Hausdorff …,Proceedings of the nineteenth annual symposium on Computational geometry,2003,36

Lower bounds for kinetic planar subdivisions,Pankaj K Agarwal; Julien Basch; Mark De Berg; Leonidas J Guibas; John Hershberger,Abstract. We revisit the notion of kinetic efficiency for noncanonically defined discreteattributes of moving data; like binary space partitions and triangulations. Under reasonablecomputational models; we obtain lower bounds on the minimum amount of work required tomaintain any binary space partition of moving segments in the plane or any Steinertriangulation of moving points in the plane. Such lower bounds—the first to be obtained inthe kinetic context—are necessary to evaluate the efficiency of kinetic data structures whenthe attribute to be maintained is not canonically defined.,Discrete & Computational Geometry,2000,34

Our data structure uses O (N/B) disk blocks to store amonotone subdivision of size N; where B is the size of a disk block.

Motion planning for a convex polygon in a polygonal environment,Pankaj K Agarwal; Boris Aronov; Micha Sharir,Abstract. We study the motion-planning problem for a convex m-gon P in a planar polygonalenvironment Q bounded by n edges. We give the first algorithm that constructs the entire freeconfiguration space (the three-dimensional space of all free placements of P in Q) in timethat is near-quadratic in mn; which is nearly optimal in the worst case. The algorithm is alsoconceptually simple. Previous solutions were incomplete; more expensive; or produced onlypart of the free configuration space. Combining our solution with parametric searching; weobtain an algorithm that finds the largest placement of P in Q in time that is also near-quadratic in mn. In addition; we describe an algorithm that preprocesses the computed freeconfiguration space so that reachability queries can be answered in polylogarithmic time.,Discrete & Computational Geometry,1999,32

We also give constructions showing that μ (n 2)combinatorial changes are possible in these extent functions even when the points move onstraight lines with constant velocities. We give a similar construction and upper bound for theconvex hull; improving known results.,Workshop on Algorithms and Data Structures,1997,31
Ray shooting amidst convex polygons in 2D,Pankaj K Agarwal; Micha Sharir,Abstract We consider the problem of ray shooting in a two-dimensional scene consistingofmconvex polygons with a total ofnedges. We present a data structure that requiresO (mnlog m) space and preprocessing time and that answers a ray shooting query inO (log 2 m log2 n) time. If the polygons are pairwise disjoint; the space and preprocessing time can beimproved toO ((m 2+ n) log m) andO ((m 2+ n log n) log m); respectively. Our algorithm alsoworks for a collection of disjoint simple polygons. We also show that if we allow onlyO (n)space; a ray shooting query among a collection of disjoint simple polygons can be answeredin timeO (⌈ m/[formula]⌉ 1+ ε log 2 n) time; for any ε> 0.,Journal of Algorithms,1996,31

Coarse and reliable geometric alignment for protein docking,Yusu Wang; Pankaj K Agarwal; Paul Brown; Herbert Edelsbrunner; Johannes Rudolph,Abstract We present an efficient algorithm for generating a small set of coarse alignmentsbetween interacting proteins using meaningful features on their surfaces. The proteins aretreated as rigid bodies; but the results are more generally useful as the producedconfigurations can serve as input to local improvement algorithms that allow for proteinflexibility. We apply our algorithm to a diverse set of protein complexes from the Protein DataBank; demonstrating the effectivity of our algorithm; both for bound and for unbound proteindocking problems.,*,2005,30

Embeddings of surfaces; curves; and moving points in euclidean space,Pankaj K Agarwal; Sariel Har-Peled; Hai Yu,Abstract In this paper we show that dimensionality reduction (ie; Johnson-Lindenstrausslemma) preserves not only the distances between static points; but also between movingpoints; and more generally between low-dimensional flats; polynomial curves; curves withlow winding degree; and polynomial surfaces. We also show that surfaces with boundeddoubling dimension can be embedded into low dimension with small additive error. Finally;we show that for points with polynomial motion; the radius of the smallest enclosing ball canbe preserved under dimensionality reduction.,Proceedings of the twenty-third annual symposium on Computational geometry,2007,29
Binary space partitions for fat rectangles,Pankaj K Agarwal; Edward F Grove; TM Murali; Jeffrey Scott Vitter,We consider the practical problem of constructing binary space partitions (BSPs) for a set Sof n orthogonal; nonintersecting; two-dimensional rectangles in \BbbR^3 such that theaspect ratio of each rectangle in S is at most α; for some constant α≧1. We present ann2^O(\logn)-time algorithm to build a binary space partition of size n2^O(\logn) for S. Wealso show that if m of the n rectangles in S have aspect ratios greater than α; we canconstruct a BSP of size nm2^O(\logn) for S in nm2^O(\logn) time. The constants ofproportionality in the big-oh terms are linear in \logα. We extend these results to cases inwhich the input contains nonorthogonal or intersecting objects.,SIAM Journal on Computing,2000,28
Comparative accuracy of methods for protein sequence similarity search.,Pankaj Agarwal; David J.  States,Abstract MOTIVATION: Searching a protein sequence database for homologs is a powerfultool for discovering the structure and function of a sequence. Two new methods forsearching sequence databases have recently been described: Probabilistic Smith-Waterman (PSW); which is based on Hidden Markov models for a single sequence using astandard scoring matrix; and a new version of BLAST (WU-BLAST2); which uses Sumstatistics for gapped alignments. RESULTS: This paper compares and contrasts theeffectiveness of these methods with three older methods (Smith-Waterman: SSEARCH;FASTA and BLASTP). The analysis indicates that the new methods are useful; and oftenoffer improved accuracy. These tools are compared using a curated (by Bill Pearson)version of the annotated portion of PIR 39. Three different statistical criteria are utilized …,Bioinformatics (Oxford; England),1998,28
Circle shooting in a simple polygon,Pankaj K Agarwal; Micha Sharir,Abstract Consider the following problem: Given a simple n-gon P; preprocess it so that for aquery circle π and a point s on π; one can quickly compute Φ (P; π; s); the first intersectionpoint between P and π as we follow π from s in clockwise direction. We show that P can bepreprocessed; in time O (n log 3 n); into a data structure of size O (n log 3 n); so that; for aquery circle π; Φ (P; π; s) can be computed in O (log 4 n) time.

Streaming algorithms for extent problems in high dimensions,Pankaj K Agarwal; R Sharathkumar,Abstract We develop (single-pass) streaming algorithms for maintaining extent measures ofa stream S of n points in R d. We focus on designing streaming algorithms whose workingspace is polynomial in d (poly (d)) and sublinear in n. For the problems of computingdiameter; width and minimum enclosing ball of S; we obtain lower bounds on the worst-caseapproximation ratio of any streaming algorithm that uses poly (d) space. On the positive side;we introduce the notion of blurred ball cover and use it for answering approximate farthest-point queries and maintaining approximate minimum enclosing ball and diameter of S.

Robust shape fitting via peeling and grating coresets,Pankaj K Agarwal; Sariel Har-Peled; Hai Yu,Abstract Let P be a set of n points in ℝ d. A subset S of P is called a (k; ε)-kernel if for everydirection; the directional width of S ε-approximates that of P; when k “outliers” can be ignoredin that direction. We show that a (k; ε)-kernel of P of size O (k/ε (d− 1)/2) can be computed intime O (n+ k 2/ε d− 1). The new algorithm works by repeatedly “peeling” away (0; ε)-kernelsfrom the point set. We also present a simple ε-approximation algorithm for fitting variousshapes through a set of points with at most k outliers. The algorithm is incremental andworks by repeatedly “grating” critical points into a working set; till the working set providesthe required approximation. We prove that the size of the working set is independent of n;and thus results in a simple and practical; near-linear ε-approximation algorithm for shapefitting with outliers in low dimensions. We demonstrate the practicality of our algorithms by …,Discrete & Computational Geometry,2008,27

Convex hulls under uncertainty,Pankaj K Agarwal; Sariel Har-Peled; Subhash Suri; Hakan Yıldız; Wuzhou Zhang,Abstract We study the convex-hull problem in a probabilistic setting; motivated by the needto handle data uncertainty inherent in many applications; including sensor databases;location-based services and computer vision. In our framework; the uncertainty of each inputpoint is described by a probability distribution over a finite number of possible locationsincluding a null location to account for non-existence of the point. Our results include bothexact and approximation algorithms for computing the probability of a query point lyinginside the convex hull of the input; time–space tradeoffs for the membership queries; aconnection between Tukey depth and membership queries; as well as a new notion of β β-hull that may be a useful representation of uncertain hulls.,Algorithmica,2017,26
Toward computational fact-checking,You Wu; Pankaj K Agarwal; Chengkai Li; Jun Yang; Cong Yu,Abstract Our news are saturated with claims of" facts" made from data. Database researchhas in the past focused on how to answer queries; but has not devoted much attention todiscerning more subtle qualities of the resulting claims; eg; is a claim" cherry-picking"? Thispaper proposes a framework that models claims based on structured data as parameterizedqueries. A key insight is that we can learn a lot about a claim by perturbing its parametersand seeing how its conclusion changes. This framework lets us formulate practical fact-checking tasks---reverse-engineering (often intentionally) vague claims; and counteringquestionable claims---as computational problems. Along with the modeling framework; wedevelop an algorithmic framework that enables efficient instantiations of" meta" algorithmsby supplying appropriate algorithmic building blocks.

Natural neighbor interpolation based grid DEM construction using a GPU,Alex Beutel; Thomas Mølhave; Pankaj K Agarwal,Abstract With modern LiDAR technology the amount of topographic data; in the form ofmassive point clouds; has increased dramatically. One of the most fundamental GIS tasks isto construct a grid digital elevation model (DEM) from these 3D point clouds. In this paper wepresent a simple yet very fast algorithm for constructing a grid DEM from massive pointclouds using natural neighbor interpolation (NNI). We use a graphics processing unit (GPU)to significantly speed up the computation. To handle the large data sets and to deal withgraphics hardware limitations clever blocking schemes are used to partition the point cloud.For example; using standard desktop computers and graphics hardware; we construct ahigh-resolution grid with 150 million cells from two billion points in less than thirty-sevenminutes.

Kinetic and dynamic data structures for closest pair and all nearest neighbors,Pankaj K Agarwal; Haim Kaplan; Micha Sharir,Abstract We present simple; fully dynamic and kinetic data structures; which are variants of adynamic two-dimensional range tree; for maintaining the closest pair and all nearestneighbors for a set of n moving points in the plane; insertions and deletions of points arealso allowed. If no insertions or deletions take place; the structure for the closest pair uses O(n log n) space; and processes O (n 2 β s+ 2 (n) log n) critical events; each in O (log 2 n)time. Here s is the maximum number of times where the distances between any two specificpairs of points can become equal; β s (q) &equals; λ s (q)/q; and λ s (q) is the maximumlength of Davenport-Schinzel sequences of order s on q symbols. The dynamic version ofthe problem incurs a slight degradation in performance: If m≥ n insertions and deletions areperformed; the structure still uses O (n log n) space; and processes O (mnβ s+ 2 (n) log 3 …,ACM Transactions on Algorithms (TALG),2008,26
Near-linear algorithms for geometric hitting sets and set covers,Pankaj K Agarwal; Jiangwei Pan,Abstract Given a finite range space Σ=(X; R); with N=| X|+| R|; we present two simplealgorithms; based on the multiplicative-weight method; for computing a small-size hitting setor set cover of Σ. The first algorithm is a simpler variant of the Brönnimann-Goodrichalgorithm but more efficient to implement; and the second algorithm can be viewed assolving a two-player zero-sum game. These algorithms; in conjunction with some standardgeometric data structures; lead to near-linear algorithms for computing a small-size hittingset or set cover for a number of geometric range spaces. For example; they lead to O (Npolylog (N)) expected-time randomized O (1)-approximation algorithms for both hitting setand set cover if X is a set of points and ℜ a set of disks in R2.,Proceedings of the thirtieth annual symposium on Computational geometry,2014,25
Continuum formulation for non-equilibrium shock structure calculation,Kun Xu; Eswar Josyula,Are extensions to continuum formulations for solving fluid dynamic problems in the transition-to-rarefied regimes viable alternatives to particle methods? It is well known that forincreasingly rarefied flow fields; the predictions from continuum formulation; such as theNavier-Stokes equations lose accuracy. These inaccuracies are attributed primarily to thelinear approximations of the stress and heat flux terms in the Navier-Stokes equations. Theinclusion of higher-order terms; such as Burnett or high-order moment equations; couldimprove the predictive capabilities of such continuum formulations; but there has beenlimited success in the shock structure calculations; especially for the high Mach numbercase. Here; after reformulating the viscosity and heat conduction coefficients appropriate forthe rarefied flow regime; we will show that the Navier-Stokes-type continuum formulation …,Communications in computational physics,2006,25
Advances in indexing for mobile objects,Pankaj K.  Agarwal; Cecilia Magdalena  Procopiuc,With the rapid advances in positioning systems; such as GPS; ad-hoc networks; andwireless communication; it is becoming increasingly feasible to track and record thechanging position of continuously moving objects. Several areas such as digital battlefields;air-traffic control; mobile communication; navigation system; and geographic informationsystems need the capability to index moving objects; so that various queries on them can beanswered in real time. The queries might relate either to the current configuration of objects;to a past configuration; or to a future configuration—in the last case; we are asked to predictthe behavior based on the current information. However; most existing database systemsassume that the data is constant unless it is explicitly modified. Such systems are notsuitable for representing; storing; and querying continuously moving objects; since …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2002,25

The novel feature of our data structures is that the number of I/Osrequired to answer a query depends not only on the size of the data set and on the numberof points in the answer but also on the difference between tq and the current time; queriesclose to the current time are answered fast; while queries that are far away in the future or inthe past may take more time.,Workshop on Algorithms and Data Structures,2001,25

Antiparallel coiled-coil–mediated dimerization of myosin X,Qing Lu; Fei Ye; Zhiyi Wei; Zilong Wen; Mingjie Zhang,Abstract Processive movements of unconventional myosins on actin filaments generallyrequire motor dimerization. A commonly accepted myosin dimerization mechanism is viaformation of a parallel coiled-coil dimer by a stretch of amino acid residues immediatelycarboxyl-terminal to the motor's lever-arm domain. Here; we discover that the predictedcoiled-coil region of myosin X forms a highly stable; antiparallel coiled-coil dimer (anti-CC).Disruption of the anti-CC either by single-point mutations or by replacement of the anti-CCwith a parallel coiled coil with a similar length compromised the filopodial induction activityof myosin X. We further show that the anti-CC and the single α-helical domain of myosin Xare connected by a semirigid helical linker. The anti-CC–mediated dimerization may enablemyosin X to walk on both single and bundled actin filaments.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2012,24
Inferential ecosystem models; from network data to prediction,James S Clark; Pankaj Agarwal; David M Bell; Paul G Flikkema; Alan Gelfand; Xuanlong Nguyen; Eric Ward; Jun Yang,Abstract Recent developments suggest that predictive modeling could begin to play a largerrole not only for data analysis; but also for data collection. We address the example ofefficient wireless sensor networks; where inferential ecosystem models can be used toweigh the value of an observation against the cost of data collection. Transmission costsmake observations “expensive”; networks will typically be deployed in remote locationswithout access to infrastructure (eg; power). The capacity to sample intensively makessensor networks valuable; but high-frequency data are informative only at specific times andlocations. Sampling intervals will range from meters and seconds to landscapes and years;depending on the process; the current states of the system; the uncertainty about thosestates; and the perceived potential for rapid change.

Polygon decomposition for efficient construction of minkowski sums,Pankaj K Agarwal; Eyal Flato; Dan Halperin,Abstract Several algorithms for computing the Minkowski sum of two polygons in the planebegin by decomposing each polygon into convex subpolygons. We examine differentmethods for decomposing polygons by their suitability for efficient construction of Minkowskisums. We study and experiment with various well-known decompositions as well as withseveral new decomposition schemes. We report on our experiments with the variousdecompositions and different input polygons. Among our findings are that in general:(i)triangulations are too costly (ii) what constitutes a good decomposition for one of the inputpolygons depends on the other input polygon—consequently; we develop a procedure forsimultaneously decomposing the two polygons such that a “mixed” objective function isminimized;(iii) there are optimal decomposition algorithms that significantly expedite the …,European Symposium on Algorithms,2000,24

Connected component and simple polygon intersection searching,Pankaj K.  Agarwal; Marc van Kreveld,Abstract Efficient data structures are given for the following two query problems:(i)preprocess a set P of simple polygons with a total of n edges; so that all polygons of Pintersected by a query segment can be reported efficiently; and (ii) preprocess a set S of nsegments; so that the connected components of the arrangement of S intersected by a querysegment can be reported quickly. In these problems we do not want to return the polygons orconnected components explicitly (ie; we do not wish to report the segments defining thepolygon; or the segments lying in the connected components). Instead; we assume that thepolygons (or connected components) are labeled and we just want to report their labels.

A Bayesian evolutionary distance for parametrically aligned sequences,Pankaj Agarwal; DAVID J STATES,ABSTRACT There is an inherent relationship between the process of pairwise sequencealignment and the estimation of evolutionary distance. This relationship is explored andmade explicit. Assuming an evolutionary model and given a specific pattern of observedbase mismatches; the relative probabilities of evolution at each evolutionary distance arecomputed using a Bayesian framework. The mean or the median of this probabilitydistribution provides a robust estimate of the central value. The evolutionary distance hastraditionally been computed as zero for an observed homology of 20 bases with nomismatches; we prove that it is highly probable that the distance is greater than 0.01. Themean of the distribution is 0.047; which is a better estimate of the evolutionary distance.Bayesian estimates of the evolutionary distance incorporate arbitrary prior information …,Journal of Computational Biology,1996,24

In this paper we describe an individual-based; spatially-explicit forest simulator with full accounting of both landscape context and the fine-scaleprocesses that influence forest dynamics. Unfortunately; performing realistic forestsimulations of such models is computationally infeasible. We design efficient algorithms forcomputing seed dispersal and light; using a plethora of techniques. These includehierarchical spatial decomposition; monopole approximation and utilizing the graphicshardware for fast geometric computations.

Model-driven matching and segmentation of trajectories,Swaminathan Sankararaman; Pankaj K Agarwal; Thomas Mølhave; Jiangwei Pan; Arnold P Boedihardjo,Abstract A fundamental problem in analyzing trajectory data is to identify common patternsbetween pairs or among groups of trajectories. In this paper; we consider the problem ofmatching similar portions between a pair of trajectories; each observed as a sequence ofpoints sampled from it. We present new measures of trajectory similarity---both local andglobal---between a pair of trajectories to distinguish between similar and dissimilar portions.We then use this model to perform segmentation of a set of trajectories into fragments;contiguous portions of trajectories shared by many of them. Our model for similarity is robustunder noise and sampling rate variations. The model also yields a score which can be usedto rank multiple pairs of trajectories according to similarity; eg in clustering applications.

Kinetic stable Delaunay graphs,Pankaj K Agarwal; Jie Gao; Leonidas Guibas; Haim Kaplan; Vladlen Koltun; Natan Rubin; Micha Sharir,Abstract The best known upper bound on the number of topological changes in theDelaunay triangulation of a set of moving points in ℜ 2 is (nearly) cubic; even if each point ismoving with a fixed velocity. We introduce the notion of a stable Delaunay graph (SDG inshort); a dynamic subgraph of the Delaunay triangulation; that is less volatile in the sensethat it undergoes fewer topological changes and yet retains many useful properties of the fullDelaunay triangulation. SDG is defined in terms of a parameter±> 0; and consists ofDelaunay edges pq for which the (equal) angles at which p and q see the correspondingVoronoi edge e pq are at least±. We prove several interesting properties of SDG anddescribe two kinetic data structures for maintaining it.

Fast molecular shape matching using contact maps,Pankaj K Agarwal; Nabil H Mustafa; Yusu Wang,In this paper; we study the problem of computing the similarity of two protein structures bymeasuring their contact-map overlap. Contact-map overlap abstracts the problem ofcomputing the similarity of two polygonal chains as a graph-theoretic problem.

The running time of the best known scheme for finding anoptimal alignment; based on dynamic programming; increases exponentially with thenumber of input sequences. Hence; many heuristics were suggested for the problem. Weconsider a version of the MSA problem where the goal is to find an optimal alignment inwhich matches are restricted to positions in predefined matching segments. We presentseveral techniques for making the dynamic programming algorithm more efficient; while stillfinding an optimal solution under these restrictions.

Our approach partitions the collection of continuous queriesinto groups based on the clustering patterns of the query ranges; and then appliesspecialized processing strategies to those heavily-clustered groups (or hotspots). Tomaintain the partition dynamically; we present efficient algorithms that maintain a nearlyoptimal partition in nearly amortized logarithmic time. We show how to use the hotspots toscalably process large numbers of continuous select-join and band-join queries; which aremuch more challenging than simple range selection queries. Experiments demonstrate …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,20
Staying in the Middle: Exact and Approximate Medians in R1 and R2 for Moving Points.,Pankaj K Agarwal; Mark de Berg; Jie Gao; Leonidas J Guibas; Sariel Har-Peled,Abstract Many divide-and-conquer based geometric algorithms and order-statisticsproblems ask for a point that lies “in the middle” of a given point set. We study severalfundamental problems of this type for moving points in one and two dimensions. Inparticular; we show how to kinetically maintain the median of a set of n points moving on thereal line; and a center point of a set of n points moving in the plane; that is; a point such thatany line through it has at most 2n/3 on either side of it. Since the maintenance of exactmedians and center points can be quite expensive; we also show how to maintain ε-approximate medians and center points and argue that the latter can be made to be muchmore stable under motion. These results are based on a new algorithm to maintain an ε-approximation of a range space under insertions and deletions; which is of independent …,CCCG,2005,20
On the complexity of many faces in arrangements of pseudo-segments and circles,Pankaj K Agarwal; Boris Aronov; Micha Sharir,Abstract We obtain improved bounds on the complexity of many faces in an arrangement ofpseudo-segments; circles; or unit circles. The bounds are worst-case optimal for unit circles;they are also worst-case optimal for the case of pseudo-segments except when the numberof faces is very small; in which case our upper bound is a polylogarithmic factor away fromthe best-known lower bound. For general circles; the bounds nearly coincide with the best-known bounds for the number of incidences between points and circles.,*,2003,20

Generating levels of detail for large-scale polygonal models,Amitabh Varshney; Pankaj K Agarwal; Frederick P Brooks Jr; William V Wright; Hans Weber,Abstract We present an e cient algorithm for generating various levels-of-detailapproximations for a given polygonal model. Our algorithm guarantees that all points of anapproximation are within a user-speci able distance from the original model and all points ofthe original model are within a distance from the approximation. Each approximationattempts to minimize the total number of polygons required to satisfy the previous constraint.We show how the problem of generating levelsof-detail approximations reduces to theclassic set partition problem. The various approximations are guaranteed to be topologicallyconsistent with the input polygonal model. The approximations can be constrained by theuser to preserve any desired edges of the input model. We also propose a method tocompute an estimate of the quality of the approximation generated by our algorithm with …,*,1995,20
Simulation of aggregation in dictyostelium using the cell programming language,Pankaj Agarwal,Abstract In developmental biology; modeling and simulation play an important role inunderstanding cellular interactions.

On stabbling lines for convex polyhedra in 3D,Pankaj K Agarwal,Abstract A line ℓ is called a stabbling line for a set B of convex polyhedra in R 3 if it intersectsevery polyhedron of B. This paper presents an upper bound of O (n 3 log n) on thecomplexity of the space of stabbling lines for B; where n is the number of edges in thepolyhedra of B. We solve a more general problem that counts the number of faces in a set ofconvex polyhedra; which are implicitly defined by a set of half-spaces and a set ofhyperplanes. We show that the former problem is a special case of the latter problem. Wealso apply this technique to obtain an upper bound on the number of distinct faces that everappear on the intersection of a set of half-spaces as we insert or delete half-spacesdynamically.,Computational Geometry,1994,19
Efficient sensor placement for surveillance problems,Pankaj K Agarwal; Esther Ezra; Shashidhara K Ganjugunte,Abstract We study the problem of covering a two-dimensional spatial region P; cluttered withoccluders; by sensors. A sensor placed at a location p covers a point x in P if x lies withinsensing radius r from p and x is visible from p; ie; the segment px does not intersect anyoccluder. The goal is to compute a placement of the minimum number of sensors that coverP. We propose a landmark-based approach for covering P. Suppose P has ς holes; and itcan be covered by h sensors. Given a small parameter ε> 0; let λ:= λ (h; ε)=(h/ε)(1+ ln (1+ ς)).We prove that one can compute a set L of O (λ log λ log (1/ε)) landmarks so that if a set S ofsensors covers L; then S covers at least (1− ε)-fraction of P. It is surprising that so fewlandmarks are needed; and that the number of landmarks depends only on h; and does notdirectly depend on the number of vertices in P.

First; wepresent a simple algorithm that determines in O (nm/spl alpha/(nm) log (nm)) time whetheran n-sided polygonal part will fall through an m-sided polygonal trap.

The ribosome scanning model for translation initiation: implications for gene prediction and full-length cDNA detection.,Pankaj Agarwal; Vineet Bafna,Abstract Biological signals; such as the start of protein translation in eukaryotic mRNA; arestretches of nucleotides recognized by cellular machinery. There are a variety of techniquesfor modeling and identifying them. Most of these techniques either assume that the basepairs at each position of the signal are independently distributed; or they allow for limiteddependencies among different positions. In previous work; we provided a statistical modelthat generalizes earlier methods and captures all significant high-order dependenciesamong different base positions. In this paper; we use a set of experimentally verifiedtranslation initiation (TI) sites (provided by Amos Bairoch) from eukaryotic sequences to traina range of methods; and then compare these methods. None of the methods is effective inpredicting TI sites. We take advantage of the ribosome scanning model (Cigan et al …,ISMB,1998,18

In this paper we describe an ecological dispersal modeldeveloped for the specific case of predicting seed dispersal by trees on a landscape for usein a forest simulation model. We present efficient approximation algorithms for computingseed dispersal. These algorithms allow us to simulate large landscapes for long periods oftime.

Star unfolding of a polytope with applications,Pankaj K Agarwal; Boris Aronov; Joseph O'Rourke; Catherine A Schevon,Abstract We define the notion of a “star unfolding” of the surface P of a convex polytope withn vertices and use it to construct an algorithm for computing a small superset of the set of allsequences of edges traversed by shortest paths on P. It requires O (n 6) time and producesO (n 6) sequences; thereby improving an earlier algorithm of Sharir that in O (n 8 log n) timeproduces O (n 7) sequences. A variant of our algorithm runs in O (n 5 log n) time andproduces a more compact representation of size O (n 5) for the same set of O (n 6)sequences. In addition; we describe an O (n 10) time procedure for computing the geodesicdiameter of P; which is the maximum possible separation of two points on P; with thedistance measured along P; improving an earlier O (n 14 log n) algorithm of O'Rourke andSchevon.,Scandinavian Workshop on Algorithm Theory,1990,14

The algorithm defines the fit in purely geometric terms and improvesby applying a rigid motion to one of the two proteins. Our implementation of the algorithmtakes between three and ten seconds and converges with high likelihood to the correctdocked configuration; provided it starts at a position away from the correct one by at most 18degrees of rotation and at most 3.0 Å of translation. The speed and convergence radiusmake this an attractive algorithm to use in combination with a coarse sampling of the six-dimensional space of rigid motions.,International Workshop on Algorithms in Bioinformatics,2004,13
Streaming algorithms for extent problems in high dimensions,Pankaj K Agarwal; R Sharathkumar,Abstract We present (single-pass) streaming algorithms for maintaining extent measures of astream S of n points in R^d. We focus on designing streaming algorithms whose workingspace is polynomial in d (poly (d)) and sub-linear in n. For the problems of computingdiameter; width and minimum enclosing ball of S; we obtain lower bounds on the worst-caseapproximation ratio of any streaming algorithm that uses poly (d) space. On the positive side;we introduce the notion of blurred ball cover and use it for answering approximate farthest-point queries and maintaining approximate minimum enclosing ball and diameter of S. Wedescribe a streaming algorithm for maintaining a blurred ball cover whose working space islinear in d and independent of n.,Algorithmica,2015,12
Stabbing convex polygons with a segment or a polygon,Pankaj K Agarwal; Danny Z Chen; Shashidhara K Ganjugunte; Ewa Misiołek; Micha Sharir; Kai Tang,Abstract Let O={O_1;...;O_m\} be a set of m convex polygons in ℝ 2 with a total of n vertices;and let B be another convex k-gon. A placement of B; any congruent copy of B (withoutreflection); is called free if B does not intersect the interior of any polygon in O at thisplacement. A placement z of B is called critical if B forms three “distinct” contacts with O at z.Let φ(B;O) be the number of free critical placements. A set of placements of B is called astabbing set of O if each polygon in O intersects at least one placement of B in this set. Wedevelop efficient Monte Carlo algorithms that compute a stabbing set of size h= O (h* log m);with high probability; where h* is the size of the optimal stabbing set of O. We also improvebounds on φ(B;O) for the following three cases; namely;(i) B is a line segment and theobstacles in O are pairwise-disjoint;(ii) B is a line segment and the obstacles in O may …,European Symposium on Algorithms,2008,12

Efficient external memory structures for range-aggregate queries,Pankaj K Agarwal; Lars Arge; Sathish Govindarajan; Jun Yang; Ke Yi,Abstract We present external memory data structures for efficiently answering range-aggregate queries. The range-aggregate problem is defined as follows: Given a set ofweighted points in R d; compute the aggregate of the weights of the points that lie inside a d-dimensional orthogonal query rectangle. The aggregates we consider in this paper includecount; sum; and max. First; we develop a structure for answering two-dimensional range-count queries that uses O (N/B) disk blocks and answers a query in O (log BN) I/Os; where Nis the number of input points and B is the disk block size. The structure can be extended toobtain a near-linear-size structure for answering range-sum queries using O (log BN) I/Os;and a linear-size structure for answering range-max queries in O (log B 2 N) I/Os. Ourstructures can be made dynamic and extended to higher dimensions.,Computational Geometry,2013,11
Localization using boundary sensors: An analysis based on graph theory,Yunhui Zheng; David J Brady; Pankaj K Agarwal,Abstract We consider sensors; such as fibers; lasers; and pyroelectric motion detectors; thatfire when objects cross a boundary. A moving object can be localized by analyzingsequences of boundary crossings. We consider the number of distinct sequences and objectpositions that can be achieved using boundary sensors in one-and two-dimensional spaces.For 1D systems we use representations of sensor sequences on graphs to derive limits onthe number of object locations that can be monitored by a given sensor population andsequence length. For 2D systems we show that in certain circumstances the ratio of thenumber of unique sensor sequences to the number of unique object paths is exponential inthe sequence length and we argue that the probability of unique identification is high forsufficiently large sequences. We also prove the triangle grid can track an object with error …,ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks (TOSN),2007,11
Independent set of intersection graphs of convex objects in 2D,Pankaj K Agarwal; Nabil H Mustafa,Abstract The intersection graph of a set of geometric objects is defined as a graph G=(S; E)in which there is an edge between two nodes si; sj∈ S if si∩ sj≠∅. The problem ofcomputing a maximum independent set in the intersection graph of a set of objects is knownto be NP-complete for most cases in two and higher dimensions. We present approximationalgorithms for computing a maximum independent set of intersection graphs of convexobjects in ℝ 2. Specifically; given a set of n line segments in the plane with maximumindependent set of size κ; we present algorithms that find an independent set of size at least(i)(κ/2log (2 n/κ)) 1/2 in time O (n 3) and (ii)(κ/2log (2 n/κ)) 1/4 in time O (n 4/3 log cn).

Algorithms for center and Tverberg points,Pankaj K Agarwal; Micha Sharir; Emo Welzl,Abstract We present a near-quadratic algorithm for computing the center regionof a set of npoints in three dimensions. This is nearly tight inthe worst case since the center region canhave Ω (n 2) complexity. We then consider the problem of recognizing whether a given pointq is a colored Tverberg point of a set of n colored points in the plane; and present the firstpolynomial-time algorithm for this problem.,Proceedings of the twentieth annual symposium on Computational geometry,2004,11
The 2-center problem in three dimensions,Pankaj K Agarwal; Rinat Ben Avraham; Micha Sharir,Abstract Let P be a set of n points in R 3. The 2-center problem for P is to find two congruentballs of minimum radius whose union covers P. We present a randomized algorithm forcomputing a 2-center of P that runs in O (β (r⁎) n 2 log 4 n log log n) expected time; here β(r)= 1/(1− r/r 0) 3; r⁎ is the radius of the 2-center balls of P; and r 0 is the radius of thesmallest enclosing ball of P. The algorithm is near quadratic as long as r⁎ is not too close tor 0; which is equivalent to the condition that the centers of the two covering balls be not tooclose to each other. This improves an earlier slightly super-cubic algorithm of Agarwal; Efrat;and Sharir (2000)[2](at the cost of making the algorithm performance depend on the centerseparation of the covering balls).,Computational Geometry,2013,10
(Approximate) uncertain skylines,Peyman Afshani; Pankaj K Agarwal; Lars Arge; Kasper Green Larsen; Jeff M Phillips,Abstract Given a set of points with uncertain locations; we consider the problem ofcomputing the probability of each point lying on the skyline; that is; the probability that it isnot dominated by any other input point. If each point's uncertainty is described as aprobability distribution over a discrete set of locations; we improve the best known exactsolution. We also suggest why we believe our solution might be optimal. Next; we describesimple; near-linear time approximation algorithms for computing the probability of each pointlying on the skyline. In addition; some of our methods can be adapted to construct datastructures that can efficiently determine the probability of a query point lying on the skyline.,Theory of Computing Systems,2013,10

We assign aweight ω(s)∈S to each interval in S. For a point x∈R; let S(x)⊆S be the set of intervals thatcontain x. Given a point q∈R; the stabbing-semigroup query asks for computings∈S(q)ω(s). We propose a linear-size dynamic data structure; under the pointer-machinemodel; that answers queries in worst-case O(\logn) time and supports both insertions anddeletions of intervals in amortized O(\logn) time. It is the first data structure that attains theoptimal O(\logn) bound for all three operations. Furthermore; our structure can easily beadapted to external memory; where we obtain a linear-size structure that answers queriesand supports updates in O(\log_Bn) I/Os; where B is the disk block size.

An improved algorithm for computing the volume of the union of cubes,Pankaj K Agarwal,1. INTRODUCTION Let C be a set of n axis-aligned cubes in R3; and let U(C) de- note the unionof C. Computing the volume of U(C) efficiently is related to the well-known Klee's measureproblem. In 1977 Victor Klee [13] had presented an O(n log n) time algorithm for com- putingthe union of n intervals in R1 and had asked whether his algorithm was optimal. An Ω(n logn) lower bound was proved by Fredmen and Weide [11]. Bentley [4] studied the two-dimensionalversion of Klee's measure problem. When extended to computing the volume of the union ofn d-dimensional axis-aligned boxes; the running time of Bentley's algorithm is O(nd−1 log n).Later; van Leeuwen and Wood [12] improved the running time to O(n2) for d = 3.

Our technique extends to derivebounds for other valuesof k and d; and we illustrate this by showing that f 2; 5 (n)= O (n 8/3).,Proceedings of the twenty-third annual symposium on Computational geometry,2007,10
Model-driven dynamic control of embedded wireless sensor networks,Paul G Flikkema; Pankaj K Agarwal; James S Clark; Carla Ellis; Alan Gelfand; Kamesh Munagala; Jun Yang,Abstract Next-generation wireless sensor networks may revolutionize understanding ofenvironmental change by assimilating heterogeneous data; assessing the relative value andcosts of data collection; and scheduling activities accordingly. Thus; they are dynamic; data-driven distributed systems that integrate sensing with modeling and prediction in anadaptive framework. Integration of a range of technologies will allow estimation of the valueof future data in terms of its contribution to understanding and cost. This balance isespecially important for environmental data; where sampling intervals will range from metersand seconds to landscapes and years. In this paper; we first describe a general frameworkfor dynamic data-driven wireless network control that combines modeling of the sensornetwork and its embedding environment; both in and out of the network.

Lower bound for sparse Euclidean spanners,Pankaj K Agarwal; Yusu Wang; Peng Yin,Abstract Given a one-dimensional graph G such that any two consecutive nodes are unitdistance away; and such that the minimum number of links between any two nodes (thediameter of G) is O (log n); we prove an Ω (n log n/log log n) lower bound on the sum oflengths of all the edges (ie; the weight of G). The problem is a variant of the widely studiedpartial sum problem. This in turn provides a lower bound on Euclidean spanner graphs withsmall diameter and low weight; showing that the upper bound from [1] is almost tight.,Proceedings of the sixteenth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms,2005,10
On the number of congruent simplices in a point,Pankaj K Agarwal; Micha Sharir,Abstract We derive improved bounds on the number of k-dimensional simplices spa nned bya set of n points in $\reals^ d $ that are congruent to a given $ k $-simplex; for $ k\le d-1$. Let$ f_k^{(d)}(n) $ be the maximum number of $ k $-simplices spanned by a set of $ n $ pointsin $\reals^ d $ that are congruent to a given $ k $-simplex. We prove that $ f_2^{(3)}(n)= O(n^{5/3}\cdot 2^{O (\alpha^ 2 (n))}) $; $ f_2^{(4)}(n)= O (n^{2+\eps}) $; $ f_2^{(5)}(n)=\Theta(n^{7/3}) $; and $ f_3^{(4)}(n)= O (n^{9/4+\eps}) $. We also derive a recurrence to bound $f_k^{(d)}(n) $ for arbitrary values of $ k $ and $ d $; and use it to derive the bound $f_k^{(d)}(n)= O (n^{d/2}) $ for $ d\le 7$ and $ k\le d-2$. Following Erd {\H o} s and Purdy; weconjecture that this bound holds for larger values of $ d $ as well; and for $ k\le d-2$.,Proceedings of the seventeenth annual symposium on Computational geometry,2001,10

Approximation algorithms for layered manufacturing.,Pankaj K Agarwal; Pavan K Desikan,Abstract An important problem in layered manufacturing is the choice of a good builddirection; which in uences the quality and the cost of manufacturing the object. We present ecient algorithms for computing a build direction that optimizes the total area of faces that arein contact with supports. For a given convex polytope with n faces and for a parameter"> 0;we present an O ((n=" 3) polylogn) algorithm that computes a build direction so that the totalarea of faces in contact with supports is at most (1+") A; where A is the minimum area ofcontact with supports for all build directions. For non-convex polyhedra; we provideevidence that the lower bound for any algorithm computing the optimal direction might be(n4). We also present a faster algorithm for some special cases.

Let w (M) denote the weight of a matching in G; and M* aminimum-cost perfect matching in G. We call a perfect matching M c-approximate; for c≥ 1; ifw (M)≤ c· w (M*).

Computing highly occluded paths on a terrain,Niel Lebeck; Thomas Mølhave; Pankaj K Agarwal,Abstract Understanding the locations of highly occluded paths on a terrain is an importantGIS problem. In this paper we present a model and a fast algorithm for computing highlyoccluded paths on a terrain. It does not assume the observer locations to be known andyields a path likely to be occluded under a rational observer strategy. We presentexperimental results that examine several different observer strategies. The repeatedvisibility map computations necessary for our model is expedited using a fast algorithm forcalculating approximate visibility maps that models the decrease in observational fidelity asdistance increases. The algorithm computes a multiresolution approximate visibility map andmakes use of a graphics processing unit (GPU) to speed up computation. We presentexperimental results on terrrain data sets with up to 144 million points.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2013,9
I/O-efficient batched union-find and its applications to terrain analysis,Pankaj K Agarwal; Lars Arge; Ke Yi,Abstract In this article we present an I/O-efficient algorithm for the batched (off-line) versionof the union-find problem. Given any sequence of N union and find operations; where eachunion operation joins two distinct sets; our algorithm uses O (SORT (N)) &equals; O (&frac;NB log M/B &frac; NB) I/Os; where M is the memory size and B is the disk block size. Thisbound is asymptotically optimal in the worst case. If there are union operations that join a setwith itself; our algorithm uses O (SORT (N)+ MST (N)) I/Os; where MST (N) is the number ofI/Os needed to compute the minimum spanning tree of a graph with N edges. We alsodescribe a simple and practical O (SORT (N) log (&frac; NM))-I/O algorithm for this problem;which we have implemented.

A two-dimensional kinetic triangulation with near-quadratic topological changes,Pankaj K Agarwal; Yusu Wang; Hai Yu,Abstract A triangulation of a set S of points in the plane is a subdivision of the convex hull ofS into triangles whose vertices are points of S. Given a set S of n points in \BbbR^2; eachmoving independently; we wish to maintain a triangulation of S. The triangulation needs tobe updated periodically as the points in S move; so the goal is to maintain a triangulationwith a small number of topological events; each being the insertion or deletion of an edge.We propose a kinetic data structure (KDS) that processes n^22^O(\logn⋅\log\logn)topological events with high probability if the trajectories of input points are algebraic curvesof fixed degree. Each topological event can be processed in O(\logn) time. This is the firstknown KDS for maintaining a triangulation that processes a near-quadratic number oftopological events; and almost matches the Ω(n^2) lower bound 1.

Selection in monotone matrices and computing k th nearest neighbors,Pankaj K Agarwal; Sandeep Sen,Abstract We present an O (m+ n√ n log n) time algorithm to select the k th smallest item froman m× n totally monotone matrix for any k≤ mn. This is the first subquadratic algorithm forselecting an item from a totally monotone matrix. Our method also yields an algorithm forgeneralized row selection in monotone matrices of the same time complexity. Given a set S=p 1;...; pn of n points in convex position and a vector k= k 1;...; kn; we also present an O (n 4/3log O (1) n) algorithm to compute the ki th nearest neighbor of pi for every i≤ n; c is anappropriate constant. This algorithm is considerably faster than the one based on a row-selection algorithm for monotone matrices. If the points of S are arbitrary; then the ki thnearest neighbor of pi; for all i≤ n; can be computed in time O (n 7/5 log cn); which alsoimproves upon the previously best-known result.,Scandinavian Workshop on Algorithm Theory,1994,9

Computing the gromov-hausdorff distance for metric trees,Pankaj K Agarwal; Kyle Fox; Abhinandan Nath; Anastasios Sidiropoulos; Yusu Wang,Abstract The Gromov-Hausdorff distance is a natural way to measure distance between twometric spaces. We give the first proof of hardness and first non-trivial approximationalgorithm for computing the Gromov-Hausdorff distance for geodesic metrics in trees.Specifically; we prove it is NP-hard to approximate the Gromov-Hausdorff distance betterthan a factor of 3. We complement this result by providing a polynomial time O (\min {n; rn\})-approximation algorithm where r is the ratio of the longest edge length in both trees to theshortest edge length. For metric trees with unit length edges; this yields an O (n)-approximation algorithm.,International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation,2015,8

A fundamental problem in analyzing trajectory data is that of identifying commonpatterns between pairs or among groups of trajectories. In this paper; we consider theproblem of identifying similar portions between a pair of trajectories; each observed as asequence of points sampled from it. We present new measures of trajectory similarity---bothlocal and global---between a pair of trajectories to distinguish between similar and dissimilarportions. Our model is robust under noise and outliers; it does not make any assumptions onthe sampling rates on either trajectory; and it works even if they are partially observed.Additionally; the model also yields a scalar similarity score which can be used to rank …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1303.1585,2013,8

Compact representations for shortest-path queries,P Agarwal,Pankaj K. Agarwal Duke University The paradigm of computing geometric summaries has recentlyemerged as a powerful tool for developing fast approximation algorithms for geometric optimizationproblems. For a given tolerance; the technique computes a “core” subset of the input points thatapproximates an underlying measure of the whole set. It is shown that for a wide range of interestingmeasures; the size of the summary depends upon the approximation error and possibly on somegeometric complexity of the input but is independent of the combinatorial description of the inputset; and that such a “compact” summary can be computed efficiently. This talk discusses somerecent results on this approach in the context of shortest-‐path queries and a few openproblems.,IROS Workshop on Progress and Open Problems in Motion Planning,2011,8

We extend previous work on occlusion cullingby taking full advantage of the visibility information; temporal coherence; and graphicshardware. We describe a simple and efficient algorithm; which exploits image-spaceapproach and temporal coherence to mark a large subset of invisible objects. Occlusion iscalculated dynamically and does not rely on any preprocessing of visibility information or ona prior selection of occluders. As a result; it can handle dynamic updates in the scene at alittle cost. The approach also provides a good framework for dealing with occlusion cullingand can be combined with many other current occlusion-culling approaches to achieve …,Proc. Eurographics,2001,8
Two randomized incremental algorithms for planar arrangements; with a twist,Pankaj K Agarwal; Sariel Har-Peled,• An algorithm for computing the union of triangles in the plane in a quasi outputsensitivetime.• A more efficient alternative to vertical decomposition of arrangements of lines in theplane; called polygonal decomposition. An efficient randomized incremental algorithm for itsconstruction is presented; and we prove that the size of the resulting decomposition isasymptotically equivalent to size of vertical decomposition. In particular; this representationis more compact than vertical decomposition; and there is ground to believe that in practice itwill perform better.,Manuscript,2001,8
Line stabbing bounds in three dimensions,Pankaj K Agarwal; Boris Aronov; Subhash Suri,Abstract Let S be a set of (possibly degenerate) triangles in< 3 whose interiors are disjoint. Atriangulation of< 3 with respect to S; denoted by T (S); is a simplicial complex in which theinterior of no tetrahedron intersects any triangle of S. The line stabbing number of T (S) is themaximum number of tetrahedra of T (S) intersected by a segment that does not intersect anytriangle of S. We investigate the line stabbing number of triangulations in several cases|when S is a set of points; when the triangles of S form the boundary of a convex or anonconvex polyhedron; or when the triangles of S form the boundaries of k disjoint convexpolyhedra. We prove almost tight worst-case upper and lower bounds on line stabbingnumbers for these cases. We also estimate the number of tetrahedra necessary to guaranteelow stabbing number.,Proc. 11th Annu.

Circular visibility from a point in a simple polygon,Pankaj K Agarwal; Micha Sharir,In this paper we define the notion of circular visibility; and present an O (n log n) timealgorithm to compute the portion of a given simple polygon circularly visible from a fixedpoint lying inside. The second problem that we study is the circle shooting from a fixed-point;which can be formulated as follows: Given a simple polygon and a point s inside; preprocessso that given a circle π passing through s; one can quickly compute the first point ofintersected by π as we follow π from s in a clockwise direction. We show that can bepreprocessed; in time O (n log n); into a data structure of linear size; so that a query can beanswered in logarithmic time.,International Journal of Computational Geometry & Applications,1993,8
Intersection queries in sets of disks,Marc van Kreveld; Mark Overmars; Pankaj K Agarwal,Abstract In this paper we develop some new data structures for storing a set of disks that cananswer different types of intersection queries efficiency. If the disks are non-intersecting weobtain a linear size data structure that can report all k disks intersecting a query line segmentin time O (n β+ ε+ k); where n is the number of disks; β= log 2 (1+√ 5)− 1≈ 0.695; and ε isan arbitrarily small positive constant. If the segment is a full line; the query time becomes O(n β+ k). For intersecting disks we obtain an O (n log n) size data structure that can answeran intersection query in time O (n 2/3 log 2 n+ k). We also present a linear size data structurefor ray shooting queries; whose query time is O (n β).,BIT Numerical Mathematics,1992,8
Parallel algorithms for constructing range and nearest-neighbor searching data structures,Pankaj K Agarwal; Kyle Fox; Kamesh Munagala; Abhinandan Nath,Abstract With the massive amounts of data available today; it is common to store andprocess data using multiple machines. Parallel programming platforms such as MapReduceand its variants are popular frameworks for handling such large data. We present the firstprovably efficient algorithms to compute; store; and query data structures for range queriesand approximate nearest neighbor queries in a popular parallel computing abstraction thatcaptures the salient features of MapReduce and other massively parallel communication(MPC) models. In particular; we describe algorithms for $ kd $-trees; range trees; and BBD-trees that only require O (1) rounds of communication for both preprocessing and queryingwhile staying competitive in terms of running time and workload to their classicalcounterparts. Our algorithms are randomized; but they can be made deterministic at some …,Proceedings of the 35th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2016,7
Stable Delaunay graphs,Pankaj K Agarwal; Jie Gao; Leonidas J Guibas; Haim Kaplan; Natan Rubin; Micha Sharir,Abstract Let P be a set of n points in\mathbb R^ 2 R 2; and let DT (P) DT (P) denote itsEuclidean Delaunay triangulation. We introduce the notion of the stability of edges of DT (P)DT (P). Specifically; defined in terms of a parameter α> 0 α> 0; a Delaunay edge pq is calledα α-stable; if the (equal) angles at which p and q see the corresponding Voronoi edge e_ pqepq are at least α α. A subgraph G of DT (P) DT (P) is called a (c α; α)(c α; α)-stableDelaunay graph (SDG SDG in short); for some absolute constant c ≥ 1 c≥ 1; if every edgein G is α α-stable and every c α c α-stable edge of DT (P) DT (P) is in G. Stability can also bedefined; in a similar manner; for edges of Delaunay triangulations under general convexdistance functions; induced by arbitrary compact convex sets Q. We show that if an edge isstable in the Euclidean Delaunay triangulation of P; then it is also a stable edge; though …,Discrete & Computational Geometry,2015,7

TerraNNI: natural neighbor interpolation on a 3D grid using a GPU,Alex Beutel; Thomas Mølhave; Pankaj K Agarwal; Arnold P Boedihardjo; James A Shine,Abstract With modern focus on LiDAR technology the amount of topographic data; in theform of massive point clouds; has increased dramatically. Furthermore; due to the popularityof LiDAR; repeated surveys of the same areas are becoming more common. This trend willonly increase as topographic changes prompt surveys over already scanned terrain; inwhich case we obtain large spatio-temporal data sets. In dynamic terrains; such as coastalregions; such spatio-temporal data can offer interesting insight into how the terrain changesover time. An initial step in the analysis of such data is to create a digital elevation modelrepresenting the terrain over time. In the case of spatio-temporal data sets those modelsoften represent elevation on a 3D volumetric grid. This involves interpolating the elevation ofLiDAR points on these grid points. In this paper we show how to efficiently perform natural …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2011,7
Stability of ε-Kernels,Pankaj K Agarwal; Jeff M Phillips; Hai Yu,Abstract Given a set P of n points in ℝ d; an ε-kernel K⊆ P approximates the directionalwidth of P in every direction within a relative (1− ε) factor. In this paper we study the stabilityof ε-kernels under dynamic insertion and deletion of points to P and by changing theapproximation factor ε. In the first case; we say an algorithm for dynamically maintaining a ε-kernel is stable if at most O (1) points change in K as one point is inserted or deleted from P.We describe an algorithm to maintain an ε-kernel of size O (1/ε (d− 1)/2) in O (1/ε (d− 1)/2+log n) time per update. Not only does our algorithm maintain a stable ε-kernel; its updatetime is faster than any known algorithm that maintains an ε-kernel of size O (1/ε (d− 1)/2).Next; we show that if there is an ε-kernel of P of size κ; which may be dramatically less thanO (1/ε (d− 1)/2); then there is an (ε/2)-kernel of P of size O(\min{1/ε^(d-1)/2;κ^⌊d/2⌋\log^d …,European Symposium on Algorithms,2010,7
On polyhedra induced by point sets in space,Pankaj K Agarwal; Ferran Hurtado; Godfried T Toussaint; Joan Trias,Abstract Given a set S of n⩾ 3 points in the plane (not all on a line) it is well known that it isalways possible to polygonize S; ie; construct a simple polygon P such that the vertices of Pare precisely the given points in S. For example; the shortest circuit through S is a simplepolygon. In 1994; Grünbaum showed that an analogous theorem holds in R 3. Moreprecisely; if S is a set of n⩾ 4 points in R 3 (not all of which are coplanar) then it is alwayspossible to polyhedronize S; ie; construct a simple (sphere-like) polyhedron P such that thevertices of P are precisely the given points in S. Grünbaum's constructive proof may yieldSchönhardt polyhedra that cannot be triangulated. In this paper several alternativealgorithms are proposed for constructing such polyhedra induced by a set of points; whichmay always be triangulated; and which enjoy several other useful properties as well …,Discrete Applied Mathematics,2008,7
Out-of-order event processing in kinetic data structures,Mohammad Ali Abam; Pankaj K Agarwal; Mark de Berg; Hai Yu,Abstract We study the problem of designing kinetic data structures (KDS's for short) whenevent times cannot be computed exactly and events may be processed in a wrong order. Intraditional KDS's this can lead to major inconsistencies from which the KDS cannot recover.We present more robust KDS's for the maintenance of two fundamental structures; kineticsorting and tournament trees; which overcome the difficulty by employing a refined eventscheduling and processing technique. We prove that the new event scheduling mechanismleads to a KDS that is correct except for finitely many short time intervals. We analyze themaximum delay of events and the maximum error in the structure; and we experimentallycompare our approach to the standard event scheduling mechanism.,European Symposium on Algorithms,2006,7
I/O efficient algorithms and applications in geographic information systems,Andrew Danner; Lars Arge; Pankaj K Agarwal,Abstract Modern remote sensing methods such a laser altimetry (lidar) and InterferometricSynthetic Aperture Radar (IfSAR) produce georeferenced elevation data at unprecedentedrates. Many Geographic Information System (GIS) algorithms designed for terrain modellingapplications cannot process these massive data sets. The primary problem is that these datasets are too large to fit in the main internal memory of modern computers and must thereforereside on larger; but considerably slower disks. In these applications; the transfer of databetween disk and main memory; or I/O; becomes the primary bottleneck. Working in atheoretical model that more accurately represents this two level memory hierarchy; we candevelop algorithms that are I/O-efficient and reduce the amount of disk I/O needed to solve aproblem.

HPRM: a hierarchical PRM,Anne D Collins; Pankaj K Agarwal; John L Harer,We introduce a hierarchical variant of the probabilistic roadmap method for motion planning.By recursively refining an initially sparse sampling in neighborhoods of the obstacleboundary; our algorithm generates a smaller roadmap that is more likely to find narrowpassages than uniform sampling. We analyze the failure probability and computation time;relating them to path length; path clearance; roadmap size; recursion depth; and a localproperty of the free space. The approach is general; and can be tailored to any variety ofrobots. In particular; we describe algorithmic details for a planar articulated arm.,Robotics and Automation; 2003. Proceedings. ICRA'03.

The bounds are worst-case tight for unitcircles; and; for general circles; they nearly coincide with the best known bounds for thenumber of incidences between m points and n circles.,Foundations of Computer Science; 2001.

Motion planning of a ball amid segments in three dimensions,Pankaj K Agarwal; Micha Sharir,Abstract Let S be a set of n pair-wise disjoint segments in W3; and let B be a ball of radius 1.The free configuration space 3 of B amid S is the set of all placements of B at which (theinterior of) B does not intersect any segment of S. We show that the combinatorial complexityof 3 is O (n5/2+ e); for any E> 0; with the constant of proportionality depending on E. This isthe first subcubic bound on the complexity of the free configuration space even when S is aset of lines in R3. We also present a randomized algorithm that can compute the boundary ofthe free configuration space in O (n5/2+ c) expected time.,Proceedings of the tenth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms,1999,7
Performance model of the externally-fired combined cycle (EFCC) system,Pankaj Agarwal; H Christopher Frey,The Externally Fired Combined Cycle (EFCC) is an advanced power generation concept;using coal or other ash bearing fuels such as peat; wood waste; and bitumen emulsion; witha potential for higher thermal efficiency and a lower cost than conventional coal-fired powergenerating systems. 1 The concept incorporates the highly efficient gas turbine combinedcycle technology for use with coal. In contrast to" direct fired" combined cycles; the EFCCconcept does not require any special fuel preparation; coal beneficiation; or coal conversion.The EFCC concept has yet to be demonstrated commercially. The concept is underdevelopment by Hague International and the US Department of Energy (DOE).

An extensive dentigerous cyst with antro-cutaneous fistula,PN Agarwal,Discussion Dentigerous cysts or follicular odontomes arise in the follicle of an uneruptedpermanent tooth. The essential feature of the cysts is that they contain a whole or part of atooth depending upon the part of follicle in which the cyst develops (Scott-Brown; 1952). Asthere is usually no inflammatory element; the cyst can continue to grow and may attain avery big size. If infection should occur; the epithelium is destroyed and the cyst remainssmall (Boyd; 1953). It is surprising that even in the presence of an external fistula; infectiondid not occur in this case. A search of the literature revealed very few reports of cases ofbenign noninflammatory expanding lesions of the antrum. Thus Capps (1952) reported twocases of neurofibromas causing swelling of the canine fossa and McLaggan and Collier(1952) gave an account of a mucocele expanding the antrum.

Our main contributions include the following:(i) The first index of sub-quadratic sizeto achieve a sub-linear query time in any dimension.(ii) A conditional lower bound for most-likely range-max queries; based on the conjectured hardness of the set-intersectionproblem.(iii) A near-linear-size index for estimating the expected range-max value withinapproximation factor 1/2 in O (polylog (n)) time.(iv) Extensions of our algorithm to moregeneral uncertainty models and for computing the top-k values of the range-max.,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2017,6
Markov-modulated marked poisson processes for check-in data,Jiangwei Pan; Vinayak Rao; Pankaj Agarwal; Alan Gelfand,Abstract We develop continuous-time probabilistic models to study trajectory data consistingof times and locations of user 'check-ins'. We model the data as realizations of a markedpoint process; with intensity and mark-distribution modulated by a latent Markov jumpprocess (MJP). We also include user-heterogeneity in our model by assigning each user avector of 'preferred locations'. Our model extends latent Dirichlet allocation by dropping thebag-of-words assumption and operating in continuous time. We show how an appropriatechoice of priors allows efficient posterior inference. Our experiments demonstrate theusefulness of our approach by comparing with various baselines on a variety of tasks.,International Conference on Machine Learning,2016,6
Approximating dynamic time warping and edit distance for a pair of point sequences,Pankaj K Agarwal; Kyle Fox; Jiangwei Pan; Rex Ying,Abstract: We give the first subquadratic-time approximation schemes for dynamic timewarping (DTW) and edit distance (ED) of several natural families of point sequences in$\mathbb {R}^ d $; for any fixed $ d\ge 1$. In particular; our algorithms compute$(1+\varepsilon) $-approximations of DTW and ED in time near-linear for point sequencesdrawn from k-packed or k-bounded curves; and subquadratic for backbone sequences.Roughly speaking; a curve is $\kappa $-packed if the length of its intersection with any ballof radius $ r $ is at most $\kappa\cdot r $; and a curve is $\kappa $-bounded if the sub-curvebetween two curve points does not go too far from the two points compared to the distancebetween the two points. In backbone sequences; consecutive points are spaced atapproximately equal distances apart; and no two points lie very close together. Recent …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.01876,2015,6
Maintaining contour trees of dynamic terrains,Pankaj K Agarwal; Lars Arge; Thomas Mølhave; Morten Revsbæk; Jungwoo Yang,Abstract: We consider maintaining the contour tree $\mathbb {T} $ of a piecewise-lineartriangulation $\mathbb {M} $ that is the graph of a time varying height function $ h:\mathbb{R}^ 2\rightarrow\mathbb {R} $. We carefully describe the combinatorial change in $\mathbb{T} $ that happen as $ h $ varies over time and how these changes relate to topologicalchanges in $\mathbb {M} $. We present a kinetic data structure that maintains the contourtree of $ h $ over time. Our data structure maintains certificates that fail only when $ h (v)= h(u) $ for two adjacent vertices $ v $ and $ u $ in $\mathbb {M} $; or when two saddle verticeslie on the same contour of $\mathbb {M} $. A certificate failure is handled in $ O (\log (n)) $time.

Generating wide-area content-based publish/subscribe workloads,Albert Yu; Pankaj K Agarwal; Jun Yang,ABSTRACT Content-based publish/subscribe systems allow events to be selectively andaperiodically pushed to subscribers according to their interests; expressed as predicates ina high-dimensional event space. Making such systems scalable in a wide-area networkrequires considering multiple factors; eg; distribution of events; similarity of subscriberinterests in the event space; and proximity of subscriber locations in the network. A majorobstacle for this research is the lack of publicly available; realistic workloads; because ofconcerns of privacy and commercial interests in releasing user information. This paperdescribes a workload generator for wide-area content-based publish/subscribe systems;which extrapolates the limited amount of various statistics available to public; and generatesa workload consistent with these statistics. The generator allows users to deviate the …,Network Meets Database (NetDB),2009,6
Untangling triangulations through local explorations,Pankaj K Agarwal; Bardia Sadri; Hai Yu,Abstract The problem of maintaining a valid mesh (triangulation) within a certain domain thatdeforms over time arises in many applications. During a period for which the underlyingmesh topology remains unchanged; the deformation moves vertices of the mesh and thuspotentially turns a mesh invalid; or as we call it; tangled. We introduce the notion of locallyremovable regions; which are certain tangled regions in the mesh that allow for localremoval and re-meshing. We present an algorithm that is able to quickly compute; throughlocal explorations; a minimum locally removable region containing a" seed" tangled regionin an invalid mesh. By re-meshing within this area; the" seed" tangled region can then beremoved from the mesh without introducing any new tangled region. The algorithm is output-sensitive in the sense that it never explores outside the output region.,Proceedings of the twenty-fourth annual symposium on Computational geometry,2008,6

Computational fact checking through query perturbations,You Wu; Pankaj K Agarwal; Chengkai Li; Jun Yang; Cong Yu,Abstract Our media is saturated with claims of “facts” made from data. Database researchhas in the past focused on how to answer queries; but has not devoted much attention todiscerning more subtle qualities of the resulting claims; for example; is a claim “cherry-picking”? This article proposes a framework that models claims based on structured data asparameterized queries. Intuitively; with its choice of the parameter setting; a claim presents aparticular (and potentially biased) view of the underlying data. A key insight is that we canlearn a lot about a claim by “perturbing” its parameters and seeing how its conclusionchanges. For example; a claim is not robust if small perturbations to its parameters canchange its conclusions significantly. This framework allows us to formulate practical fact-checking tasks—reverse-engineering vague claims; and countering questionable claims …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2017,5
On channel-discontinuity-constraint routing in wireless networks,Swaminathan Sankararaman; Alon Efrat; Srinivasan Ramasubramanian; Pankaj K Agarwal,Abstract Multi-channel wireless networks are increasingly deployed as infrastructurenetworks; eg in metro areas. Network nodes frequently employ directional antennas toimprove spatial throughput. In such networks; between two nodes; it is of interest to computea path with a channel assignment for the links such that the path and link bandwidths are thesame. This is achieved when any two consecutive links are assigned different channels;termed as “Channel-Discontinuity-Constraint”(CDC). CDC-paths are also useful in TDMAsystems; where; preferably; consecutive links are assigned different time-slots. In the firstpart of this paper; we develop a t-spanner for CDC-paths using spatial properties; a sub-network containing O (n/θ) links; for any θ> 0; such that CDC-paths increase in cost by atmost a factor t=(1− 2 sin (θ/2))− 2.

We concentrate on the technique that to reduced the leakage current in standbymode. The one CMOS transistor leakage current due to various parameter is the vital role ofpower consumption. The CMOS leakage current at the process level can be decreased bysome implement on deep sub micron method. The circuit level technique is reduced powerconsumption at very high level.

Monitoring continuous band-join queries over dynamic data,Pankaj K Agarwal; Junyi Xie; Jun Yang; Hai Yu,Abstract A continuous query is a standing query over a dynamic data set whose query resultneeds to be constantly updated as new data arrive. We consider the problem of constructinga data structure on a set of continuous band-join queries over two data sets R and S; whereeach band-join query asks for reporting the set {(r; s)∈ R× S| a≤ r–s≤ b} for someparameters a and b; so that given a data update in R or S; one can quickly identify thesubset of continuous queries whose results are affected by the update; and computechanges to these results. We present the first nontrivial data structure for this problem thatsimultaneously achieves subquadratic space and sublinear query time. This is achieved byfirst decomposing the original problem into two independent subproblems; and thencarefully designing data structures suitable for each case; by exploiting the particular …,International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation,2005,5
A 2d kinetic triangulation with near-quadratic topological changes,Pankaj K Agarwal; Yusu Wang; Hai Yu,Abstract A triangulation of a set S of points in the plane is a subdivision of the convex hull ofS into triangles whose vertices are points of S. Given a set S of n points in &Ropf; 3; eachmoving independently; we wish to maintain a triangulation of S. The triangulation needs tobe updated periodically as the points in S move; so the goal is to maintain a triangulationwith small number of topological events; each being the insertion or deletion of an edge. Wepropose a kinetic data structure (KDS) that processes n 2 2 O (√ log n• log log n) topologicalevents; with high probability; if the trajectories of input points are algebraic curves of fixeddegree. Each topological event can be processed in O (log n) time. This is the first knownKDS for maintaining a triangulation that processes near-quadratic number of topologicalevents; and almost matches the Ω (n 2) lower bound;[1].

Computing maximally separated sets in the plane and independent sets in the intersection graph of unit disks,Pankaj K Agarwal; Mark Overmars; Micha Sharir,Abstract Let S be a set of n points in R 2. Given an integer 1≤ k≤ n; we wish to find amaximally separated subset I⊆ S of size k; this is a subset for which the minimum among the(k 2) pairwise distances between its points is as large as possible. The decision problemassociated with this problem is to determine whether there exists I⊆ S;| I|= k; so that all (k 2)pairwise distances in I are at least 2; say. This problem can also be formulated in terms ofdisk-intersection graphs: Let D be the set of unit disks centered at the points of S. The disk-intersection graph G of D connects pairs of disks by an edge if they have nonemptyintersection. I is then the set of centers of disks that form an independent set in the graph G.This problem is known to be NP-Complete if k is part of the input.

Occlusion Culling for Fast Walkthrough in Urban Areas,Yusu Wang; Pankaj K Agarwal; Sariel Har-Peled,Abstract This paper describes a fast algorithm; based on occlusion culling; for renderingcomplex urban environments. Occlusion culling has been widely used to achieve interactiveframe rates for rendering very large data sets. We extend previous work on occlusion cullingby taking full advantage of the visibility information; temporal coherence; and graphicshardware. We describe a simple and efficient algorithm; which exploits image-spaceapproach and temporal coherence to mark a large subset of invisible objects. Occlusion iscalculated dynamically and does not rely on any preprocessing of visibility information or ona prior selection of occluders. As a result; it can handle dynamic updates in the scene at alittle cost. The approach also provides a good framework for dealing with occlusion cullingand can be combined with many other current occlusion-culling approaches to achieve …,*,2000,5

Intersection queries in sets of disks,Marc van Kreveld; Mark Overmars; Pankaj K Agarwal,Abstract In this paper we develop some new data structures for storing sets of disks such thatdifferent types of queries can be answered efficiently. In particular we study intersectionqueries with lines and line segments and shooting queries. In the case of non-intersectingdisks we obtain structures that use linear storage and have a query time of O (n β+ ε+ k) forintersection queries; where n is the number of disks; β= log 2 (1+\sqrt 5)− 1≈ 0.695; ε is anarbitrarily small positive constant; and k is the number of disks reported. For sets ofintersecting disks we obtain a structure that uses O (n log n) storage and answers a query intime O (n 2/3 log 2 n). For ray shooting we obtain a structure that uses linear storage and hasO (n β+ ε) query time; for any ε> 0.,Scandinavian Workshop on Algorithm Theory,1990,5

Eng; H Kim Lyerly,ABSTRACT Purpose: Although local oncolytic viral therapy (OVT) may enhance tumor lysis;antigen release; and adaptive immune responses; systemic antitumor responses post-therapy are limited. Adoptive immunotherapy with autologous dendritic cells (DC) andcytokine-induced killer cells (DC–CIK) synergizes with systemic therapies. We hypothesizedthat OVT with Herpes Simplex Virus-granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor(HSV-GM-CSF) would induce adaptive T cell responses that could be expandedsystemically with sequential DC–CIK therapy. Patients and Methods: We performed a pilotstudy of intratumoral HSV-GM-CSF OVT followed by autologous DC–CIK cell therapy.

Efficient algorithms for k-regret minimizing sets,Pankaj K Agarwal; Nirman Kumar; Stavros Sintos; Subhash Suri,Abstract: A regret minimizing set Q is a small size representation of a much larger databaseP so that user queries executed on Q return answers whose scores are not much worse thanthose on the full dataset. In particular; a k-regret minimizing set has the property that theregret ratio between the score of the top-1 item in Q and the score of the top-k item in P isminimized; where the score of an item is the inner product of the item's attributes with auser's weight (preference) vector. The problem is challenging because we want to find asingle representative set Q whose regret ratio is small with respect to all possible userweight vectors. We show that k-regret minimization is NP-Complete for all dimensions d>= 3.This settles an open problem from Chester et al.[VLDB 2014]; and resolves the complexitystatus of the problem for all d: the problem is known to have polynomial-time solution for d …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.01446,2017,4

From data reverence to data relevance: Model-mediated wireless sensing of the physical environment,Paul G Flikkema; Pankaj K Agarwal; James S Clark; Carla Ellis; Alan Gelfand; Kamesh Munagala; Jun Yang,Abstract Wireless sensor networks can be viewed as the integration of three subsystems: alow-impact in situ data acquisition and collection system; a system for inference of processmodels from observed data and a priori information; and a system that controls theobservation and collection. Each of these systems is connected by feedforward andfeedback signals from the others; moreover; each subsystem is formed from behavioralcomponents that are distributed among the sensors and out-of-network computationalresources. Crucially; the overall performance of the system is constrained by the costs ofenergy; time; and computational complexity.

The height of a row is defined to be the height ofthe tallest rectangle in that row; and the width of a column is defined to be the width of thewidest rectangle in that column. The cost of a packing is the sum of the heights of the M rowsplus the sum of the widths of the N columns. The oriented aligned rectangle packingproblem is to find a packing with the minimum cost.

We analyze in detailthe topological (or discrete) changes in the structure of the Voronoi diagram and theDelaunay triangulation of P; under the convex distance function defined by Q; as the pointsof P move along prespecified continuous trajectories. Assuming that each point of P movesalong an algebraic trajectory of bounded degree; we establish an upper bound of O (k^ 4n λ_r (n)) O (k 4 n λ r (n)) on the number of topological changes experienced by the diagramsthroughout the motion; here λ _r (n) λ r (n) is the maximum length of an (n; r)-Davenport–Schinzel sequence; and r is a constant depending on the algebraic degree of the motion ofthe points. Finally; we describe an algorithm for efficiently maintaining the above structures;using the kinetic data structure (KDS) framework.,Discrete & Computational Geometry,2015,3

We investigate the problem of answering contour queries on M: Given aheight l and a triangle f of M that intersects the level set of M at height l; report the list of theedges of the connected component of this level set that intersect f; sorted in clockwise orcounter-clockwise order. Contour queries are different from level-set queries in that only onecontour (connected component of the level set) out of all those that may exist is expected tobe reported.

Covering points by strips in the plane,Pankaj K Agarwal; Cecilia M Procopiuc,Abstract Given a set S of n points in Rd and an integer k> 0; we want to cover S by k strips sothat the maximum width of a strip is minimized. This problem stems from the pattern-discovering class of problems with important applications in data mining; pattern recognitionetc. Let w be the smallest value so that S can be covered by k strips; each of width at most w:Computing k strips of width even at most Cw; for any constant C> 0; that cover S is known tobe NP-Complete 31]; even when d= 2: In this paper we propose an e cient approximationalgorithm for the planar case; that approximates both the number of strips and the optimalwidth. More precisely; we present a randomized algorithm that computes O (k logk) strips ofwidth at most 6w that cover S; and whose expected running time is O (nk2 log4 n); if k2 logkn: Our algorithm also works for larger values of k; but then the expected running time is O …,Proc. 11th Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms,2000,3

Occlusion Culling Using Exact Shadow Computations and Ray-Shooting Queries,Pavan K Desikan; TM Murali; Pankaj K Agarwal,Abstract Occlusion culling is a powerful and general technique used in computer graphicsfor rendering large scenes quickly. It determines the visible scene by computing a smallsuperset of the set of visible objects and rendering this superset using fast graphicshardware. In this paper; we present a new algorithm for the e cient occlusion culling ofmassive polygonal models. Given a viewpoint; our strategy is to carefully select a small setof polygons (called occluders) that promise to hide most invisible polygons. We compute theregions of space hidden by the occluders and render only those triangles that do notcompletely lie in the invisible regions. Unlike previous occlusion-culling algorithms; ourtechnique can compute the occluded regions exactly and can thus discover when a polygonis hidden by multiple disconnected occluders. Our algorithm uses the Binary Space …,Preliminary draft; Duke University,2000,3
Modeling and evaluation of externally fired combined cycle using ASPEN,Pankaj Agarwal; H Christopher Frey,A new performance model of the externally fired combined cycle (EFCC) is implemented inASPEN (Advanced System for Process ENgineering); a chemical process simulator. Themodel accounts for interactions within and between approximately a dozen major processareas. The new model is applied to case studies to evaluate the sensitivity of processperformance to the ranges of uncertainty in key model inputs such as heat losses; carbonconversion; and air leakage rates; and to illustrate how alternative designs; including steaminjection and flue gas desulfurization (FGD); can affect plant thermal efficiency and netpower output. The model results suggest that careful attention to the design of the FGDsystem is needed; especially with respect to reheat; and that steam injection may offer costsavings associated with reducing the size of the steam turbine with little or no penalty on …,Journal of energy engineering,1997,3

Nearest-Neighbor Searching Under Uncertainty I,Pankaj K Agarwal; Alon Efrat; Swaminathan Sankararaman; Wuzhou Zhang,Abstract Nearest-neighbor queries; which ask for returning the nearest neighbor of a querypoint in a set of points; are important and widely studied in many fields because of a widerange of applications. In many of these applications; such as sensor databases; locationbased services; face recognition; and mobile data; the location of data is imprecise. Wetherefore study nearest-neighbor queries in a probabilistic framework in which the locationof each input point and/or query point is specified as a probability density function and thegoal is to return the point that minimizes the expected distance; which we refer to as theexpected nearest neighbor (ENN ENN). We present methods for computing an exact ENNENN or an ε ε-approximate ENN ENN; for a given error parameter 0< ε< 1 0< ε< 1; underdifferent distance functions. These methods build a data structure of near-linear size and …,Discrete & Computational Geometry,2017,2

Finding diverse; high-value representatives on a surface of answers,You Wu; Junyang Gao; Pankaj K Agarwal; Jun Yang,Abstract In many applications; the system needs to selectively present a small subset ofanswers to users. The set of all possible answers can be seen as an elevation surface overa domain; where the elevation measures the quality of each answer; and the dimensions ofthe domain correspond to attributes of the answers with which similarity between answerscan be measured. This paper considers the problem of finding a diverse set of k high-qualityrepresentatives for such a surface. We show that existing methods for diversified top-k andweighted clustering problems are inadequate for this problem. We propose k-DHR as abetter formulation for the problem. We show that k-DHR has a submodular and monotoneobjective function; and we develop efficient algorithms for solving k-DHR with provableguarantees. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the usefulness of the …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,2

Computing highly occluded paths using a sparse network,Niel Lebeck; Thomas Mølhave; Pankaj K Agarwal,Abstract Computing paths over a terrain that are highly occluded with respect to observers isan important problem in GIS. Given a fast algorithm for computing the visibility map; the path-planning step becomes the bottleneck. In this paper; we present an approach for quicklycomputing occluded paths over a terrain using a sparse network; a sparse 1-dimensionalnetwork over the terrain. We present different strategies for constructing the sparse network.Experimental results show that our approach results in significantly improved time forcomputing highly occluded paths between two query points; and that the different strategiesoffer a tradeoff between higher-quality paths and lower preprocessing times. Furthermore;there are strategies that achieve near-optimal paths with small preprocessing cost.,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2014,2

Subscriber assignment for wide-area content-based publish/subscribe,Albert Yu; Pankaj K Agarwal; Jun Yang,We study the problem of assigning subscribers to brokers in a wide-area content-basedpublish/subscribe system. A good assignment should consider both subscriber interests inthe event space and subscriber locations in the network space; and balance multipleperformance criteria including bandwidth; delay; and load balance. The resultingoptimization problem is NP-complete; so systems have turned to heuristics and/or simpleralgorithms that ignore some performance criteria. Evaluating these approaches has beenchallenging because optimal solutions remain elusive for realistic problem sizes. To enableproper evaluation; we develop a Monte Carlo approximation algorithm with good theoreticalproperties and robustness to workload variations.

Study and Analysis of Geometric Effect of Ball Burnishing Process of Different Materials and Evaluation of Forces and Strain for Ballizing Process,PAWAN K UPADHYAY; AR Ansari; PANKAJ AGARWAL,Abstract: The process consists of forcing an oversized ball of a hard material through a pre-machines hole in softer material. The interference between the ball and the hole causes thehole to expand such that its deformation is partly plastic and partly elastic. The elasticdeformation of the hole is recovered due to elastic spring back whereas the plasticdeformation results in a slight permanent increase in the hole diameter after ballizing. Ballburnishing or Ballizing is a production process for improve the accuracy and surface finish ofholes. This process is a mass production process for sizing and finishing holes. The sizingand finishing of holes depends upon the interference adopted for ballizing process. Thispaper is an attempt toward comparing surfaces effects; Estimation of deflection; deformation;radial strain; stress and finished dimensions of Mild steel and Aluminium.,Current World Environment,2012,2
Markovian software reliability model for two types of failures with imperfect debugging rate and generation of errors,M Jain; SC Agrawal; P Agarwal,Abstract This investigation deals with a software reliability model based on Markov process.For formulating the model; we define a random variable representing the cumulative numberof faults successfully corrected upto a specified point of time. This model is based on theassumption that there are two types of software failures. Further the concepts of imperfectdebugging environment and error generation phenomenon are taken into consideration.Transient analysis based on Laplace transform and matrix approach has been done to findthe solution of the system of differential difference equations.

Segmenting motifs in protein-protein interface surfaces,Jeff M Phillips; Johannes Rudolph; Pankaj K Agarwal,Abstract Protein-protein interactions form the basis for many intercellular events. In thispaper we develop a tool for understanding the structure of these interactions. Specifically;we define a method for identifying a set of structural motifs on protein-protein interfacesurfaces. These motifs are secondary structures; akin to α-helices and β-sheets in proteinstructure; they describe how multiple residues form knob-into-hole features across theinterface. These motifs are generated entirely from geometric properties and are easilyannotated with additional biological data. We point to the use of these motifs in analyzinghotspot residues.,International Workshop on Algorithms in Bioinformatics,2006,2

Given an integer 1≤ k≤ n; we wish to find amaximally separated subset I⊆ S of size k; this is a subset for which the minimum amongthe   k 2 pairwise distances between its points is as large as possible. The decisionproblem associated with this problem is to determine whether there exists I⊆ S;| I|= k; so thatall   k pairwise distances in I are at least 2; 2 say. This problem can also be formulated interms of disk-intersection graphs: Let D be the set of unit disks centered at the points of S.The disk-intersection graph G of D connects pairs of disks by an edge if they have nonemptyintersection. I is then the set of centers of disks that form an independent set in the graph G.This problem is known to be NP-Complete if k is part of the input.

Our algorithm has the novel featurethat it tunes its performance to the geometric properties of the rectangles; eg; their aspectratios. We have implemented our algorithm and tested its performance on real data sets. Wehave also systematically compared the performance of our algorithm with that of othertechniques presented in the literature.

In particular; given a set S of 3D pointsthat is distributed across multiple machines; we present a simple randomized algorithm toconstruct a TIN DEM of S by computing the Delaunay triangulation of the xy-projections ofpoints in S; which is also stored across multiple machines. With high probability; thealgorithm works in O (1) rounds and the total work performed is O (n log n). Next; wedescribe an efficient algorithm in the MPC model for computing the contour tree of theresulting DEM.

TerraNNI: Natural Neighbor Interpolation on 2D and 3D Grids Using a GPU,Pankaj K Agarwal; Alex Beutel; Thomas Mølhave,Abstract With modern focus on remote sensing technology; such as LiDAR; the amount ofspatial data; in the form of massive point clouds; has increased dramatically. Furthermore;repeated surveys of the same areas are becoming more common. This trend will onlyincrease as topographic changes prompt surveys over already scanned areas; in whichcase we obtain large spatiotemporal datasets. An initial step in the analysis of such spatialdata is to create a digital elevation model representing the terrain; possibly over time. In thecase of spatial (spatiotemporal; respectively) datasets; these models often representelevation on a 2D (3D; respectively) grid. This involves interpolating the elevation of LiDARpoints on these grid points.,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems (TSAS),2016,1

Prediction of Secondary Structure of Protein using Support Vector Machine,Shavian Agarwal; Pankaj Agarwal; Deepali Mendiratta,ABSTRACT The tertiary structure of protein is difficult to predict accurately directly from aprotein sequence. The intermediate step is required to predict the structure which project theone dimensional structure into the three dimensional structure. This intermediate step iscalled secondary structure of protein. The secondary structure of protein plays a key role inthe designing of drugs. There are many machine learning algorithms such as HMM (hiddenmarkov model); SVM (Support vector machine); NN (neural network); Fuzzy Logic.

A Near-Linear Time ε-Approximation Algorithm for Bipartite Geometric Matching,R Sharathkumar; Pankaj K Agarwal,Abstract For point sets A; B∈ Rd;| A|=| B|= n; and for a parameter ε> 0; we present analgorithm that computes; in O (npoly (log n; 1/ε)) time; a matching whose cost is within (1+ ε)of optimal perfect matching with high probability; the previously best known algorithm takesΩ (n3/2) time. We approximate the Lp norm using a distance function; d (·;·) based on arandomly shifted quad-tree. Our algorithm iteratively generates an approximate minimum-cost augmenting path under d (·;·) in time proportional to the length of the path. We show thatthe total length of the augmenting paths generated by the algorithm is O ((n/ε) log n);implying that the running time of our algorithm is O (npoly (log n; 1/ε)).,*,2011,1

An On-line Occlusio-Culling Algorithm for Fast Walkthrough in Urban Areas,Yusu Wang; Pankaj K Agarwal; Sariel Har-Peled,Abstract: We describe a fast algorithm to speed up rendering of scenes for walkthroughs inurban environments. Our occlusion culling algorithm takes advantage of temporalcoherence in image space. As such; occlusion calculation is performed online only whenneeded. This enables us to employ intelligent occluder-selection and culling algorithms. Wedo not preprocess visibility information or pre-select occluders. Therefore; we can updatescenes dynamically at a little cost. The algorithm features a tradeoff between accuracy andefficiency. While it approximates visibility testing; our experiments show that errors occurrarely.

Probabilistic Modeling and Optimization of Clean Coal Technologies: Case Studies of the Externally-Fired Combined Cycle (EFCC) System,H Christopher Frey; Pankaj Agarwal; To Appear In; To Be Presented At,The Externally Fired Combined Cycle (EFCC) is an advanced coal-fired power generationconcept with a potential for higher thermal efficiency and lower cost than conventional coal-based systems. 1 The concept incorporates efficient gas turbine combined cycle technologyfor use with coal. Unlike" direct fired" combined cycles; the EFCC does not require anyspecial fuel preparation. The EFCC concept has yet to be demonstrated commercially. Theconcept is under development by Hague International and the US Department of Energy(DOE). The main obstacle to the development of a viable EFCC system has been theunavailability of a suitable heat exchanger which would allow for a sufficiently high gasturbine inlet temperature.

Special-purpose languages: describing biological cells by computer programs,Pankaj Agarwal,Embryonic cells organize themselves to not only form tissues and organs; but the resultingorganism often contains visually spectacular patterns. The blueprint for this organization ispre-ordained (genetic); yet intercellular communication plays a major role. Embryonicsystems are fault-tolerant; in the absence of a particular cell type; other cell types willassume that role. Turing; in a seminal paper published in 1952; suggested that reaction-diffusion systems obeying physical laws could lead to various stable patterns seen inbiological systems [6]. Gordon proposed that cells could be described by computerprograms (with a special set of instructions) and their behavior simulated [4]. Cellularautomata and Lindenmayer systems [5] have also been proposed as models to aid the studyof cellular behavior.

High temperature deformation of Hastelloy alloy C-276,Pankaj Agarwal; AH Shabaik,ABSTRACT High temperature deformation of Hastelloy alloy C-276 was studied. Hotcompression tests were carried out at 1900; 2000; 2050 and 2100 F and at strain ratesranging from 10s3 to 1 set-I. The relationship between flow stress; strain; strain rate andtemperature was examined and the mechanical equation of state was developed. Stress;strain and strain rate behavior at 2100 F was found to be markedly different from that at 1900and 2000 F. The material showed a high degree of strain hardening at 2100 F. Theactivation energy for the deformation of Hastelloy alloy C-276 was found to be 109Kcal/mole which is much higher than the activation energy for self-diffusion of nickel. It issuggested that dynamic recrystallization could be the rate-controlling mechanism.Microstructure examination revealed that recrystallization was promoted by higher …,Superalloys: metallurgy and manufacture: proceedings of the Third International Symposium; September 12-15; 1976; Seven Springs; Pennsylvania,1976,1

We present a kinetic datastructure (KDS) for maintaining the Reeb graph R of h as the heights of M's vertices varycontinuously with time. Assuming the heights of two vertices of M become equal only O (1)times; the KDS processes O ((k+ g) n\polylog n) events; n is the number of vertices in M; andk is the number of external events which change the combinatorial structure of R. Each eventis processed in O (\log^ 2 n) time; and the total size of our KDS is O (gn).

Flood Risk Analysis on Terrains,Mathias Rav; Aaron Lowe; Pankaj K Agarwal,Abstract An important problem in terrain analysis is modeling how water flows across aterrain and creates floods by filling up depressions. In this paper we study the flooding queryproblem: Given a rain region R and a query point q on the terrain; quickly determine howmuch rain has to fall in R so that q is flooded. Available terrain data is often subject touncertainty which must be incorporated into the terrain analysis. For instance; the digitalelevation models of terrains have to be refined to incorporate underground pipes; tunnels;and waterways under bridges; but there is often uncertainty in their existence. Byrepresenting the uncertainty in the terrain data explicitly; we can develop methods for floodrisk analysis that properly incorporate terrain uncertainty when reporting what areas are atrisk of flooding.

Abstract A38: Checkpoint blockade elicits unique T cell expansion to promote tumor regression,Erika J Crosby; Junping Wei; Xiao Yi Yang; Gangjun Lei; Tao Wang; Cong-Xiao Liu; Pankaj Agarwal; H Kim Lyerly; Zachary C Hartman,While PD-1 and CTLA-4 immune checkpoint antibodies have led to durable clinical activityin certain cancers; only a fraction of patients exhibit responses. In these responsive tumors;PD-1 and CTLA-4 antibodies are thought to interfere with tumor immunosuppression of T-cells; however; the exact mechanisms of action and potential synergism between thesetherapies remains unclear. As triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are characterized byelevated expression of inflammatory and immunosuppressive molecules; as well as highlevels of immune infiltrating T cells (TILs); we hypothesized that they would be susceptible totreatment with PD-1 and CTLA-4 antibodies.

As anovel approach to boost local anti-tumor immunity and sensitize cancers to these therapies;we constructed an adenoviral (Ad) vector to overexpress the innate signaling adaptormolecule; Mitochondrial Antiviral Signaling protein (MAVS). Overexpression of MAVS resultsin innate immune signaling downstream of the RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) resulting in theactivation of multiple signaling pathways as well as the release of a Th1 cytokine milieu andtype I interferons. We therefore hypothesized that adenoviral delivery of MAVS into the tumormicroenvironment would produce robust inflammatory signaling which would alter the …,*,2017,*
Long-term utility and complication profile of open craniotomy for biopsy in patients with idiopathic encephalitis,Kalil G Abdullah; Yin Li; Prateek Agarwal; Nikhil R Nayak; Jayesh P Thawani; Ramani Balu; Timothy H Lucas,Abstract Neurosurgeons are often asked to perform open biopsy for diagnosis ofencephalitis after medical investigations are non-diagnostic. These patients may be criticallyill with multiple comorbidities. Patients and their families often request data regarding thesuccess rates and complication profile of biopsy; but minimal literature exists in this area.Retrospective chart review of all patients undergoing open brain biopsy (burr hole orcraniotomy) for encephalitis refractory to medical diagnosis between January 2009 andDecember 2013 was undertaken. Pathology records and outpatient follow-up were reviewedto determine most recent clinical status of each patient. A total of 59 patients were includedwith mean follow up of 20months. The average age at biopsy was 55years. The mostcommon unconfirmed diagnoses leading to biopsy were vasculitis (44%); neoplasm (27 …,Journal of Clinical Neuroscience,2017,*
Abstract P2-04-27: CTLA-4 and PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors enhance individually tailored adaptive anti-tumor immune responses to overcome tumor immunosuppres...,ZC Hartman; EJ Crosby; JP Wei; XY Yang; GJ Lei; T Wang; CX Liu; P Agarwal; MS Morse; HK Lyerly,Despite a lack of unifying drivers in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC); our lab andothers have uncovered that these cancers have elevated expression of inflammatory genesand immunosuppressive molecules (ie PD-L1); as well as elevated numbers of infiltratingimmune cells (including CD8+ T-cells and Foxp3+ T-regulatory cells) which suggests thetherapeutic potential for single and combinations of checkpoint blockade antibodies. Whileearly trials with PD-1 inhibitors have been encouraging for TNBC; only a fraction of treatedpatients respond to this therapy. To test and define the mechanisms that govern responses;we explored the utility and mechanistic basis of both PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibition ingenerating tumor-specific immunity in an established murine model of TNBC. Consistentwith patient samples; we found TNBC tumors from our model exhibited elevated PD-1+ …,*,2017,*

328 A Propensity-Based Analysis of the Use of Prothrombin Complex Concentrate Prior to Emergent Neurosurgical Procedures.,Prateek Agarwal; Ashwin G Ramayya; Kalil G Abdullah; Nikhil Nayak; Timothy H Lucas,Abstract Reversal of anticoagulation is required to mitigate the risk of intracranial bleedingbefore urgent neurosurgical procedures. New pharmacological agents; such as multifactorprothrombin complex concentrate (PCC; Kcentra); promise rapid efficacy but may raise theprobability of thrombotic complications above vitamin K infusion or administration of freshfrozen plasma (FFP). In this study; we examined the rate of thrombotic complications inneurosurgical patients who received either PCC or FFP and Vitamin K before undergoingurgent surgery. Sixty-three consecutive patients who received anticoagulation reversal forurgent neurosurgical procedures were identified between 2008 and 2014 at a level I traumacenter. They were divided into 2 cohorts based on reversal method; either PCC (n= 28) orFFP/Vitamin K (n= 35). The rate of thrombotic complications within 72 hours of reversal …,Neurosurgery,2016,*

An Efficient Algorithm for Placing Electric Vehicle Charging Stations,Pankaj K Agarwal; Jiangwei Pan; Will Victor,Abstract Motivated by the increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EV) and a lack ofcharging stations in the road network; we study the shortest path hitting set (SPHS) problem.Roughly speaking; given an input graph G; the goal is to compute a small-size subset H ofvertices of G such that by placing charging stations at vertices in H; every shortest path in Gbecomes EV-feasible; ie; an EV can travel between any two vertices of G through theshortest path with a full charge. In this paper; we propose a bi-criteria approximationalgorithm with running time near-linear in the size of G that has a logarithmic approximationon| H| and may require the EV to slightly deviate from the shortest path. We also present adata structure for computing an EV-feasible path between two query vertices of G.,LIPIcs-Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics,2016,*

In the present study; we assume that the software system consists of a finitenumber of reused components and newly developed components. For the reusedcomponents we do not consider software reliability growth phenomenon because of theeffect of severity of the faults whereas; for the newly developed components we consider thisphenomenon. A time dependent correction lag function is used for correcting the detectedand isolated errors. The total expected delivery cost and software reliability are evaluatedduring the (i) testing phase and (ii) operational phase.

Mergeable Coresets,Pankaj K Agarwal; Graham Cormode; Zengfeng Haung; Jeff M Phillips; Zhewei Wei; Ke Yi,Abstract We study the mergeability of data summaries. Informally speaking; mergeabilityrequires that; given two summaries on two data sets; there is a way to merge the twosummaries into a summary on the two data sets combined together; while preserving theerror and size guarantees. This property means that the summary can be treated like otheralgebraic objects such as sum and max; which is especially useful for computing summarieson massive distributed data. Many data summaries are trivially mergeable by construction;most notably those based on linear transformations. But some other fundamental ones likethose for heavy hitters and quantiles; are not (known to be) mergeable. In this paper; wedemonstrate that these summaries are indeed mergeable or can be made mergeable afterappropriate modifications. Specifically; we show that for ε-approximate heavy hitters …,Third Workshop on Massive Data Algorithmics (MASSIVE),2011,*

STUDIES ON SOFTWARE QUALITY AND RELIABILITY GROWTH MODELS,Priyanka Agarwal,Software reliability growth models (SRGMs) are fundamental base to assess the reliabilitygrowth quantitatively. Discrete SRGMs are required to calculate the accurate softwarereliability growth. In this chapter; a discrete flexible software reliability growth model (SRGM)based on non-homogeneous poisson process (NHPP) is developed to predict the errorremoval phenomenon using probability generating function (PGF). Two different forms offailure detection and removal are considered that are dependent on the complexity of thefault. The parameters of fault detection and removal rates depict both exponential and S-shaped curves which show the flexibility of the model. The proposed model incorporates thefault generation function and imperfect debugging phenomenon with learning factors.

Warranty Cost Analysis of Software Reliability Growth Model (SRGM) with Imperfect Debugging and Change-point,M Jain; SC Agrawal; Priyanka Agarwal,Abstract In this paper; the optimal release policy for constructing the software reliabilitygrowth model (SRGM) that incorporates both imperfect debugging and change-pointconcepts has been investigated. In any realistic situations the change-point problem may berealized due to change in many factors like testing strategies; environment; resourceallocation; etc.. It is important to ensure when to stop testing or when to release the softwareso that the total system development cost can be minimized subject to reliability constraint.To evaluate the total expected cost; a warranty cost model using non-homogeneous processalong with change-point phenomenon is discussed.

COS 89-5: Forest biodiversity is not maintained by the immigration-extinction balance,Sean McMahon; James S Clark; Pankaj K Agarwal; Michael Dietze,Background/Question/Methods A adult tree in the canopy of an intact forest can producemillions of seeds over its lifetime. On average; only one of those seeds will replace it as areproductive adult in the canopy. Diverse forests; however; are often assumed to bemaintained by broadly dispersed propagules from a regional seed pool that can preservepopulations of locally rare species against competitive exclusion; or drive models of howforest stands remain diverse through input from a hypothetical regional community. Theoriesbased on the importance of dispersal mechanisms; therefore; do not align with the reality ofextreme mortality of seeds. Direct tests of the importance of seed dispersal in maintainingbiodiversity have been inhibited by a lack of processing power needed to run models thatcan simulate realistic dispersal and recruitment of millions of seeds across landscapes …,The 94th ESA Annual Meeting,2009,*

There is practical evidenceshowing that a two step approach could be an aid to this problem; namely; first computing apolyhedral reconstruction isotopic to the sampled surface; and secondly minimizing theabsolute Gaussian curvature of this reconstruction globally. The first step ensurestopological correctness and the second step improves the geometric accuracy of thereconstruction in the presence of sharp features without changing its topology.

It isknown that a center-transversal line always exists 12; 24 but the best known algorithm forfinding such a line takes roughly n 12 time. We propose an algorithm that finds a center-transversal line in \itO(\itn^\rm1+\itϵ\itκ^\rm2(\itn)) worst-case time; for any \itϵ> 0; where\itκ(\itn) is the maximum complexity of a single level in an arrangement of n planes in ℝ 3.With the current best upper bound \itκ (n)= O (n 5/2) of 21; the running time is\itO(\itn^\rm6+\itϵ); for any \itϵ>0.

The two windings of the transformer greatly boostup the displacement current flowing through the panel capacitance during the transition timeand hence enable a fast inversion of the voltage polarity with practical values of resonantinductance. The resonant inductance can be increased by a factor of (n+ 1) 2 as comparedto prior approaches. Increased inductance results in lower peak and rms current stressesand hence reduced conduction losses both in the resonant inductor and the energy recovery(auxiliary) switches. The proposed circuit can achieve zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) of thesustain switches and zero-current-switching (ZCS) of the auxiliary switches. The operationalprinciple and design procedure of the proposed circuit are presented with theoretical …,Power Electronics Specialists Conference; 2006. PESC'06. 37th IEEE,2006,*

Faster algorithms for optimal multiple sequence alignment based on pairwise comparisons,Pankaj K Agarwal; Yonatan Bilu; Rachel Kolodny,Abstract Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) is one of the most fundamental problems incomputational molecular biology. The running time of the best known scheme for finding anoptimal alignment; based on dynamic programming; increases exponentially with thenumber of input sequences. Hence; many heuristics were suggested for the problem. Weconsider the following version of the MSA problem: In a preprocessing stage pairwisealignments are found for every pair of sequences. The goal is to find an optimal alignment inwhich matches are restricted to positions that were matched at the preprocessing stage. Wepresent several techniques for making the dynamic programming algorithm more efficient;while still finding an optimal solution under these restrictions. Namely; in our formulation theMSA must conform with pairwise (local) alignments; and in return can be solved more …,International Workshop on Algorithms in Bioinformatics,2005,*

Object Space Segmentation by Geometric Reference Structures,Pankaj K Agarwal; David Brady; Jirı Matoušek,Abstract Segmentation of an object space by binary radiation sensors and geometricreference structures is studied in this paper. Given a family of binary radiation sensors and ageometric reference structure; we refer to the set of sensor states induced by a source atpoint¤ as the signature of¤.

A near-quadratic algorithm for fence design,Pankaj K Agarwal; Robert-Paul Berretty; Anne D Collins,Abstract A part feeder is a mechanism that receives a stream of identical parts in arbitraryorientations and outputs them oriented the same way.

Their algorithm is based on the following facts.Consider a knot K in the Euclidean space and the associated Gauss map G (K) that maps anordered pair of distinct points on K; parametrised in S1×(0; 2π); to the direction of the vectorthat joins them in S2. The map G (K) naturally extends to S1×[0; 2π]; it coincides with the unittangent map of K on S1× 0 and with the opposite map on S1× 2π.

36 RANGE SEARCHING,Pankaj K Agarwal,Range searching is one of the central problems in computational geometry; because itarises in many applications and a variety of geometric problems can be formulated as range-searching problems. A typical range-searching problem has the following form. Let S be aset of n points in Rd; and let R be a family of subsets of Rd; elements of R are called ranges.We wish to preprocess S into a data structure; so that for a query range γ; the points in S∩ γcan be reported or counted efficiently. Typical examples of ranges include rectangles;halfspaces; simplices; and balls. If we are only interested in answering a single query; it canbe done in linear time; using linear space; by simply checking each point of S whether it liesin the query range. However; most of the applications call for querying the same set Sseveral times (perhaps with periodic insertions and deletions); in which case we would …,*,2004,*

We then present an extension ofthe k-means clustering algorithm for projective clustering in arbitrary subspaces; and alsopropose techniques to avoid local minima. Unlike previous algorithms; ours can choose thedimension of each cluster independently and automatically. Furthermore; experimentalresults show that our algorithm is significantly more accurate than the previous approaches.,*,2004,*

Kinetic medians and-trees,Pankaj K Agarwal; Jie Gao; L Guibas,Abstract. We propose algorithms for maintaining two variants of-trees of a set of movingpoints in the plane. A pseudo-tree allows the number of points stored in the two children todiffer by a constant factor. An overlapping-tree allows the bounding boxes of two children tooverlap. We show that both of them support range search operations in Ч (вНОЗЏ) time;where Џ only depends on the approximation precision. As the points move; we use event-based kinetic data structures to update the tree when necessary. Both trees undergo only aquadratic number of events; which is optimal; and the update cost for each event is onlypolylogarithmic. To maintain the pseudo-tree; we develop algorithms for computing anapproximate median level of a line arrangement; which itself is of great interest. We showthat the computation of the approximate median level of a set of lines or line segments …,Proc. 10th European Sympos. Algo,2002,*

We first present an indexing structure that; for any given constant ε> 0; uses O (N/B)disk blocks; where B is the block size; and answers a query in O ((N/B) 1/2+ Ï+ K/B) I/Os. Itcan also report all the points of S that lie inside R during a given time interval. A point can beinserted or deleted; or the trajectory of a point can be changed; in O (log2Ø N) I/Os. Next; wepresent a general approach that improves the query time if the queries arrive inchronological order; by allowing the index to evolve over time.

Occlusion Culling Using Exact Shadow Computations and Ray-Shooting Queries (Preliminary Draft),Pavan K Desikany; TM Muraliz; Pankaj K Agarwalx,Abstract Occlusion culling is a powerful and general technique used in computer graphicsfor rendering large scenes quickly. It determines the visible scene by computing a smallsuperset of the set of visible objects and rendering this superset using fast graphicshardware. In this paper; we present a new algorithm for the e cient occlusion culling ofmassive polygonal models. Given a viewpoint; our strategy is to carefully select a small setof polygons (called occluders) that promise to hide most invisible polygons. We compute theregions of space hidden by the occluders and render only those triangles that do notcompletely lie in the invisible regions. Unlike previous occlusion-culling algorithms; ourtechnique can compute the occluded regions exactly and can thus discover when a polygonis hidden by multiple disconnected occluders.

In the second part of the paperwe present a general technique that yields faster randomized algorithms for solving anumber of geometric optimization problems; including (i) computing the width of a point setin 3-space;(ii) computing the minimum-width annulus enclosing a set of n points in the …,*,1995,*
Efficient Random Arrangements,János Pach; Pankaj K Agarwal,In Chapter 6 we established upper bounds for the maximal (minimal) density of a packing(covering) with unit balls in d-dimensional Euclidean space. Now we discuss the oppositeproblem: We want to show the existence of unit ball packings with high density (coveringswith low density). Our methods will be nonconstructive. We will show that some latticearrangements generated by randomly selected basis vectors will be quite efficient; withpositive probability. The idea of the proof goes back to Minkowski and was developed furtherby Hlawka and Rogers. We also present a slightly different probabilistic argument; due toRush; which is based on the existence of certain codes.,Combinatorial Geometry,1995,*
More on Repeated Distances,János Pach; Pankaj K Agarwal,In the previous chapters (particularly in Chapter 10) we established several results on thedistribution of distances among n points in rf-dimensional Euclidean space Rd. Weaddressed the problem of estimating fdin); the maximum number of times the same distancecan occur among n points in Rd and developed some powerful techniques for studyingthese questions; but even in the plane (d= 2) we are very far from having satisfactoryanswers. However; if we impose some special conditions on the point sets (eg; they are inconvex position; or in general position; etc.); or if we are interested in the maximum numberof times some special distance (eg; the maximum distance or the minimum distance) can getrepeated; then the analogous questions often become less difficult. The aim of this chapter isto present some results of this kind; but even in this area there are more unsolved …,Combinatorial Geometry,1995,*
Lattice Packing and Lattice Covering,János Pach; Pankaj K Agarwal,Given a convex disc C and a lattice A; the collection C={C+ X| XeA} of all translates of C byvectors in A is called a lattice arrangement. In the special case when the members of C donot have interior points in common (resp. the members of C cover the whole plane); C is saidto be a lattice packing (resp. lattice covering). The main conclusion of Chapter 3 was thatunder fairly general conditions; the density of a packing of congruent copies of C in theplane cannot exceed the density of the densest lattice packing of C. Similarly; no coveringwith (noncrossing) copies of C can be thinner than the thinnest lattice covering (cf.Corollaries 3.6 and 3.12). In this chapter we discuss how economical the best latticepackings and coverings are.,Combinatorial Geometry,1995,*
Arrangement of Lines,János Pach; Pankaj K Agarwal,A century ago; Sylvester (1893) posed the following problem in the Educational Times:"Prove that it is not possible to arrange any number of real points so that a right line throughevery two of them shall pass through a third; unless they all lie in the same right line." Theproblem remained unsolved until 1933; when it was raised independently by Erdos; andwas solved shortly afterward by Gallai (see Erdos; 1943; 1982; Melchior; 1940; Coxeter;1948; 1969; Dirac; 1951; Kelly and Moser; 1958; and Csima and Sawyer; 1993; 1995 forother solutions and generalizations). When more than 60 years ago Erdos and Gallai startedasking questions that even Euclid would understand and appreciate; they initiated a revivalof the most elementary concepts of geometry. Incidence relations between points and linesin the Euclidean and projective planes came to new life as objects of combinatorial study …,Combinatorial Geometry,1995,*
Circle Packings and Planar Graphs,János Pach; Pankaj K Agarwal,Given a convex body C; what is the maximum number of" neighbors" that can touch anelement in a packing of congruent copies of C? The special case of this question when C=B3 (the three-dimensional ball) was the subject of a famous dispute between Gregory andNewton; and it was perhaps the first genuine problem in discrete geometry. In fact; one canset a more ambitious task. Given a packing C of convex bodies; let the contact graph of C bedefined as a graph whose vertices are associated with the members of C; two vertices beingconnected by an edge if and only if the corresponding members touch each other.Characterize the class of graphs that can be obtained as the contact graph of a packing ofcongruent copies (similar copies; translates; etc.) of a fixed convex body C (cf.

Approximation of a Convex Set by Polygons,János Pach; Pankaj K Agarwal,Computing (exactly or approximately) the area and the perimeter of a region is one of theoldest and toughest problems in geometry. A standard approach; which goes back at least toArchimedes; is to approximate the region with polygons. In this chapter we present someuseful regularity properties of the best approximation (Dowker's theorems). We also showthat from the point of view of approximation by inscribed polygons; the ellipses are the worstpossible convex regions. Finally; we describe an elegant argument of Elekes to explain whyit is hard to estimate the volume of high-dimensional convex bodies.,Combinatorial Geometry,1995,*
The Method of Cell Decomposition,János Pach; Pankaj K Agarwal,Thue's theorem; discussed in Chapter 3; states that the (upper) density of a packing ofcongruent circles in the plane cannot exceed 7r/vl 2; the density of the densest latticepacking. The proof enabled us to generalize this result for packings of congruent copies ofany convex disc (Theorem 3.2). However; in the special case when all members of thepacking are equal circles; our proof can be much simplified. The simplification is due to theapplication of a concept which turns out to be extremely useful in the investigation of manyother problems in this field.,Combinatorial Geometry,1995,*
Methods of Blichfeldt and Rogers,János Pach; Pankaj K Agarwal,All notions and questions about packing and covering densities can readily be generalizedto higher dimensions (see Definitions 3.1; 3.5; and 3.11). However; it is a surprisingly difficultproblem to find a reasonable upper bound for the density 8 (C) of the densest packing ofcongruent copies of a compact convex set C£ Rd; even in the special case when C is theunit ball Bd. In a review written in 1831; Gauss (1836) proved the density of the densestlattice packing with balls in R3; dL (B3)= ir/VlS= 0.7404; but it is still not known (althoughundoubtedly true) whether 8 (B3)= 5L (B3).(For a recent attempt to establish this equality;see Hsiang; 1993. Cf. Figure 6.1.) In higher-dimensional spaces the situation is even morecomplicated. This can be explained by the fact; supported by many" experiments" that it isvery unlikely that 5 (Bd)-&L (Bd) would hold for all d. Actually; there is no reason to …,Combinatorial Geometry,1995,*

Packing and Covering with Congruent Convex Discs,János Pach; Pankaj K Agarwal,As we have seen (Corollary 1.4); it is easy to show that the density of any lattice packing C ofcongruent circles (ie; the portion of the plane covered by the elements of C) is at most ir/Vl2.In his lecture at the Scandinavian Natural Science Congress in 1892; A. Thue extended thisresult to any packing of congruent circles. In other words; he proved that the densest packingof equal circles is necessarily lattice-like. Thue's theorem; as well as its dual counterpart forcovering (established by Kershner in 1939); remained largely unnoticed until the 1950s;when L. Fejes Toth discovered many far-reaching generalizations of these results. Hisseminal book (L. Fejes Toth; 1953) laid the foundations of a rich discipline: the theory ofpacking and covering. The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the basic concepts of thistheory and to present some generalizations of the above results to packing and covering …,Combinatorial Geometry,1995,*
Geometric Discrepancy,János Pach; Pankaj K Agarwal,The discrepancy of H is defined as disc (H)-min disc (H; c); c where the minimum is takenover all two-colorings of the vertices. In other words; we want to find a two-coloring which isas" uniform" as possible; in the sense that every edge of H contains roughly the samenumber of points of color+ 1 and-1. The theory of uniform distribution; especially discrepancytheory; has a long history; and it has several applications in number theory; geometry; andnumerical analysis (see; eg; Beck and Chen; 1987; Kuipers and Niederreiter; 1974; Hlawka;1944; Beck and Sos; 1994; and Sos; 1989). It is not surprising that probabilistic andcombinatorial methods play a central role in this field. However; it is intuitively less clear whyharmonic analysis and integral geometry are instrumental in discrepancy theory. The aim ofthis chapter is to illustrate some of these techniques by concentrating on a few sample …,Combinatorial Geometry,1995,*
Epsilon Nets and Transversals of Hypergraphs,János Pach; Pankaj K Agarwal,For historical reasons; a finite set-system is often called a hypergraph. More precisely; ahypergraph H consists of a finite set V (H) of vertices (points) and a family E (H) of subsets ofV (H). The elements of E (H) are usually called hyperedges (or; in short; edges). If thehyperedges of H are r-element sets; then H is said to be an r-uniform hypergraph. Using thisterminology; a graph is a two-uniform hypergraph. In Chapter 10 we have extended somegraph-theoretic results to r-uniform hypergraphs (cf. Theorems 10.11 and 10.12). Theconcept of hypergraphs is a very general one; so it is not surprising that hypergraph theoryhas a large scale of applications in various fields of mathematics; including geometry. Givena hypergraph H; a subset T c V (H) is called a transversal of H if TO E is nonempty for everyedge E e E (H).

Applications of the Bounds on Incidences,János Pach; Pankaj K Agarwal,Erdos's questions about the distribution of distances (quoted in the introduction to Chapter10) can be generalized in several directions. For instance; given an n-element point set P;we can try to find an upper bound on the number of^-tuples in P satisfying some specialconditions (k> 2). In particular; for k-2; we can ask for the maximum number of pairs p\; pi& Psuch that the line p\pi bisects P c R2. 1^* 1= n; into two (nearly) equal halves (see Lovasz;1971; Erdos; Lovasz et al.; 1973; Pach et al.; 1992; Barany et al.; 1990; Aronov; Chazelle etal.; 1991; Dey and Edelsbrunner; 1993; etc.). For k= 3; we may wish to bound the number oftriangles P1P2P3 (/> i;/> 2> p3£ P) of the same area; of the same perimeter; or containing agiven number of other elements of P in its interior. A number of such problems were raisedby Erdos and Purdy (1971; 1975; 1976; 1989). In this chapter we settle some of these …,Combinatorial Geometry,1995,*
Repeated Distances in Space,János Pach; Pankaj K Agarwal,Because of the many failed attempts to give reasonable bounds for these functions; even inthe case of planar sets; one had to realize that the above questions are not merely" gems" inrecreational mathematics. They have raised deep problems; some of which can be solvedusing graph-theoretic and combinatorial ideas. In fact; the discovery of many importantcombinatorial techniques and results was strongly motivated by their expected geometricconsequences. In this chapter we demonstrate how the extremal graph-theoretic toolsintroduced in Chapter 9 can be applied to problem 1 mentioned above and to some closelyrelated questions.,Combinatorial Geometry,1995,*
Computing Depth Orders and Related Problems,Pankaj K Agarwaly; Matthew J Katzz; Micha Sharirx,Abstract Let K be a set of n non-intersecting objects in 3-space. A depth order of K; if exists;is a linear order< of the objects in K such that if K; L 2 K and K lies vertically below L then K<L. We present a new technique for computing depth orders; and apply it to several specialclasses of objects. Our results include:(i) If K is a set of n triangles whose xy-projections areallfat'; then a depth order for K can be computed in time O (nlog5 n).(ii) If K is a set of nconvex and simply-shaped objects whose xy-projections are allfat'and their sizes are withina constant ratio from one another; then a depth order for K can be computed in time O (n1= 2s (n) log4 n); where s is the maximum number of intersections between the boundaries of thexy-projections of any pair of objects in K; and s (n) is the maximum length of (n; s) Davenport-Schinzel sequences.,*,1994,*

Can Visibility Graphs Be Represented CompactlyP* Pankaj K. Agarwal† Noga Alon Boris Aronov Subhash Suri March 16; 1993,Pankaj K Agarwal,Abstract We consider the problem of representing the visibility graph of line segments as aunion of cliques and bipartite cliques. Given a graph G; a family G={G¥; G2;...; Gk} is called aclique cover of G if (i) each Gi is a clique or a bipartite clique; and (ii) the union of Gi is G.The size of the clique cover G is defined as Ãki=¥ Åi; where Åi is the number of vertices in Gi.Our main result is that there exist visibility graphs of Å nonintersecting line segments in theplane whose smallest clique cover has size Ω (Å2/log2Å). An upper bound of 0 (Å2/log Å) onthe clique cover follows from a wellknown result in extremal graph theory. On the other hand;we show that the visibility graph of a simple polygon always admits a clique cover of size 0(Å log3 Å); and that there are simple polygons whose visibility graphs require a clique coverof size Ω (Å log Å).,*,1993,*

Markov-modulated marked Poisson processes for check-in data [draft],Pankaj K Agarwal; DUKE EDU; Alan E Gelfand,Abstract We develop continuous-time probabilistic models to study trajectory data consistingof times and locations of user 'check-ins'. We model these as realizations of a marked pointprocess; with intensity and mark-distribution modulated by a latent Markov jump process(MJP). We extend this Markov-modulated marked Poisson process to include user-heterogeneity by assigning users vectors of 'preferred locations'. Our model extends latentDirichlet allocation by dropping the bag-of-words assumption; and operating in continuoustime. We show how an appropriate choice of priors allows efficient posterior inference. Ourexperiments demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by comparing with variousbaselines on a variety of tasks.,*,*,*
40 RANGE SEARCHING,Pankaj K Agarwal,A central problem in computational geometry; range searching arises in many applications;and a variety of geometric problems can be formulated as range-searching problems. Atypical range-searching problem has the following form. Let S be a set of n points in Rd; andlet R be a family of subsets of Rd; elements of R are called ranges. Typical examples ofranges include rectangles; halfspaces; simplices; and balls. Preprocess S into a datastructure so that for a query range γ∈ R; the points in S∩ γ can be reported or countedefficiently. A single query can be answered in linear time using linear space; by simplychecking for each point of S whether it lies in the query range. Most of the applications;however; call for querying the same set S numerous times; in which case it is desirable toanswer a query faster by preprocessing S into a data structure.

Secondary Structure Prediction Using ANN Learning,Pankaj Agarwal; Sakshi Jain; Swati Verma Deepika,Abstract: This paper presents two methods for predicting the secondary structure of proteinsbased on artificial neural network learning. Two variations of NN learning rule are employedusing feedforward backpropogation architecture for predicting secondary structure ofproteins from their promary sequences of amino acids. About 500 sequences and more than10000 patterns were trained with variable size of patterns. After initial level of training; anaccuracy rate of about 70%-75% is obtained through first learning rule wheras 80-85% ofaccuracy is obtained using the second variation of the learning rule. Both the methods areimplemented within a software tool by the name NNSec developed on Visual .NET flatform.,*,*,*

Journal of Theoretical Biologd; 1 76 (1): 79-89; 1995 Cellular Segregation and Engulfment Simulations Using the Cell Programming Language,Pankaj Agarwal,Abstract In developmental biology; modeling and simulation play an important role inunderstanding cellular interactions. In this paper a simple language; the Cell ProgrammingLanguage (CPL); is suggested for writing programs that describe this behavior. Using theseprograms; it is possible to simulate and visualize intercellular behavior. CPL is used tomodel cellular segregation based upon the differential adhesion hypothesis. Resultsindicate that a high degree of segregation can be produced in a mixture of cells by allowingrandom motion. The engulfment of a tissue by a less adhesive tissue is also observed; whenthe two tissues are placed in contact. Both these simulations utilize only local interactionsand random motion of cells. Earlier simulations used long-range interactions to observesimilar effects. The present simulations prove that random motion of cells can produce …,*,*,*

Geometry of Numbers,János Pach; Pankaj K Agarwal,The geometry of numbers is a 100-year-old discipline that emerged from number theory.Minkowski (1896) made the fruitful observation that many important results in diophantineapproximation and in other central fields of number theory can be established by easygeometric arguments. The starting point of this theory is an ingenious statement formulatedby Minkowski (Theorem 1.7); which can be regarded as a trivial extension of the pigeonholeprinciple to measurable sets. The aim of this chapter is to present some immediateconsequences of this result; including the elegant proofs of the two-and four-squarestheorems of Fermat.,Combinatorial Geometry,*,*
Extremal Graph Theory,János Pach; Pankaj K Agarwal,Extremal graph theory was started by a group of enthusiastic young students attending D.Konig's graph theory classes at the Budapest Polytechnic in the early 1930s. P. Erdos; T.Gallai; E. Klein; G. Szekeres; and P. Turan established a number of fundamental theorems inthis field; which turned out to have important geometric applications. Some of their earlyresults are mentioned in the classical book of Konig (1936). Let G be a simple graph withvertex set V (G) and edge set E (G); that is; G has no loops or parallel edges. One of thebasic problems of extremal graph theory is to determine the maximum number of edges in agraph G with n vertices under the assumption that it satisfies a certain property (P. In mostapplications the property fP is that" G does not contain a subgraph isomorphic to some fixedgraph H." H is usually called theforbidden subgraph. In this chapter we present some …,Combinatorial Geometry,*,*
Identifying Common Portions between Two Trajectories,Swaminathan Sankararaman; Pankaj K Agarwal; Thomas Mølhave; Arnold P Boedihardjo,Trajectories are functions from a time domain—an inter- val on the real line—to Rd with d >1; and observed as sequences of points sampled from them. A fundamental problem in analyzingthis data is that of identifying com- mon patterns between pairs or among groups of trajecto- riesobserved as sequences of sampled points.

Motion Planning for a Steering-Constrained Point Robot through Moderate Obstacles,Pankaj K Agarwal; Prabhakar Raghavany; Hisao Tamakiz,Abstract Most mobile robots use steering mechanisms to guide their motion. Suchmechanisms have stops that constrain the rate at which the robot can change its direction.We study a point robot in the plane subject to such constraints; in the presence of a class ofobstacles we call moderate obstacles. We consider the case in which the robot has areverse gear that allows it to back up; as well as the case when it does not. All our algorithmsrun in polynomial time and produce paths whose lengths are either optimal or within anadditive constant of optimal.,*,*,*
Approximate Shape fitting via Linearization,Pankaj K Agarwal; Sariel Har-Peled; Kasturi R Varadarajan,Abstract Shape fitting is an important optimization problem in computational geometry. Wepresent a general technique for solving such problems: For a given a point set P in IRd; thistechnique can be used to ε-approximate:(i) the min-width annulus and shell that containsP;(ii) minimum width cylindrical shell containing P;(iii) diameter; width; minimum volumebounding box of P; and (iv) all the previous measures for the case the points are moving.The running time of the resulting algorithms is O (n+ 1/εc); where c is a constant thatdepends on the problem at hand. Our new general technique enable us to solve thoseproblems in a plug and play manner; and for several of those problems our results areconsiderably faster than what was previously known. An interesting consequence of thistechnique for the measures we consider is the existence of a small subset of P that …,*,*,*

Lower Bound for Sparse Geometric Spanners,Pankaj K Agarwal; Yusu Wang; Peng Yin,Abstract Given a one-dimensional graph G such that any two consecutive nodes are unitdistance away; and that the minimum number of links between any two nodes (the diameterof G) is O (log n); we provide an Ω (n log n/log log n) lower bound on the sum of lengths of allthe edges (ie; the weight of G). The problem is a variant of the widely studied partial sumsproblem. This in turn provides a lower bound on Euclidean spanner graphs with smalldiameter and low weight; showing that the upper bound from [1] is almost tight.,*,*,*
An E cient Algorithm for Terrain Simplification,Pankaj K Agarwal; Pavan K Desikany,Abstract Given a set S of n points in< 3; sampled from an unknown bivariate function f (x;y)(ie; for each point p 2 S; zp= f (xp; yp)); a piecewise-linear function g (x; y) is called an"-approximation of f (x; y) if for every p 2 S; jf (x; y) g (x; y) j". The problem of computing an"-approximation with the minimum number of vertices is NP-Hard. We present a randomizedalgorithm that computes an"-approximation of size O (c2 log2 c) in O (n2++ c3 log2 clog nc)expected time; where c is the size of the"-approximation with the minimum number ofvertices and is any arbitrarily small positive number. Under some reasonable assumptions;the size of the output is close to O (clogc) and the expected running time is O (n2+). We haveimplemented a variant of this algorithm and include some empirical results.,*,*,*

Modeling and Analyzing Massive Terrain Data,Pankaj K Agarwal; Thomas Mølhave,Figure 1. Lidar data set. is bringing unprecedented advances in the characterization andunderstanding of the earth's surface; its dynamics; and its properties. For instance; secondgeneration airborne LIDAR technology can map the earth's surface at a 15-20cm horizontalresolution; and the future generation of LIDAR scanners are expected to generate high-resolution (few meters) contiguous maps of other planets and their moons. Data frommultiple sensors; such as multi-wavelength and multiple lidars for simultaneous terrestrialand under-water mapping; combined air and ground level lidar surveys; simultaneous color;infrared or multispectral imagery further improve the terrain object classification;visualization and derivation of terrain properties. Moreover; one can survey phenomena andevents and track many mobile objects fairly accurately. So not only do we have high …,*,*,*
Coarse and Reliable Geometric Alignment for Protein Docking,PK AGARWAL; P BROWN; H EDELSBRUNNER; J RUDOLPH,Abstract. We present an efficient algorithm for generating a small set of coarse alignmentsbetween interacting proteins using meaningful features on their surfaces. The proteins aretreated as rigid bodies; but the results are more generally useful as the producedconfigurations can serve as input to local improvement algorithms that allow for proteinflexibility. We apply our algorithm to a diverse set of protein complexes from the Protein DataBank; demonstrating the effectivity of our algorithm; both for bound and for unbound proteindocking problems.,*,*,*

A k-directional assembly sequence for S; with respectto D; is a linear ordering hs1;:::; sni of the bodies in S; such that each si can be moved to innity by translating it in one of the directions of D and without intersecting any sj; for j> i. Wepresent an algorithm that computes a k-directional assembly sequence; or decides that nosuch sequence exists; for a set of polyhedra. The algorithm runs in O (km4= 3+") time; wherem is the total number of vertices of the polyhedra. We also give an algorithm fork-directional'rotational motions.,*,*,*

A Scalable Algorithm for Light Computation,Sathish Govindarajan; Sukhendu Chakraborty; Michael C Dietze; Pankaj K Agarwal; James S Clark; Michael S Wolosin,Abstract Models of forest ecosystems are needed to understand how climate and land-usechange impact carbon storage and biodiversity. Light is the primary resource that controlsthe germination; growth and survival of trees in a forest. However; existing models cannotcapture the details of forest light without large sacrifices in efficiency; thus limiting their abilityto explore large spatial and temporal domains. In this paper we describe a forest light modelbased on a novel graphics-processor algorithm that reduces runtime by two orders ofmagnitude over conventional ray tracing algorithms without sacrificing fine-scale detail inunderstory light conditions. These algorithms allow us to simulate large landscapes for longperiods of time without loss of accuracy. We also present experimental results that comparesthe uncertainty in our light predictions to the (much larger) inherent variability in the …,*,*,*
