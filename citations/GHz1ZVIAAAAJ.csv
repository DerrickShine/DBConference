The new casper: Query processing for location services without compromising privacy,Mohamed F Mokbel; Chi-Yin Chow; Walid G Aref,Abstract This paper tackles a major privacy concern in current location-based serviceswhere users have to continuously report their locations to the database server in order toobtain the service. For example; a user asking about the nearest gas station has to reporther exact location. With untrusted servers; reporting the location information may lead toseveral privacy threats. In this paper; we present Casper 1; a new framework in whichmobile and stationary users can entertain location-based services without revealing theirlocation information. Casper consists of two main components; the location anonymizer andthe privacy-aware query processor. The location anonymizer blurs the users' exact locationinformation into cloaked spatial regions based on user-specified privacy requirements. Theprivacy-aware query processor is embedded inside the location-based database server …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,1201
SINA: Scalable incremental processing of continuous queries in spatio-temporal databases,Mohamed F Mokbel; Xiaopeing Xiong; Walid G Aref,Abstract This paper intoduces the Scalable INcremental hash-based Algorithm (SINA; forshort); a new algorithm for evaluting a set of concurrent continuous spatio-temporal queries.SINA is designed with two goals in mind:(1) Scalability in terms of the number of concurrentcontinuous spatio-temporal queries; and (2) Incremental evaluation of continyous spatio-temporal queries. SINA achieves scalability by empolying a shared execution paradigmwhere the execution of continuous spatio-temporal queries is abstracted as a spatial joinbetween a set of moving objects and a set of moving queries. Incremental evaluation isachived by computing only the updates of the previously reported answer. We introduce twotypes of updaes; namely positive and negative updates. Positive or negative updatesindicate that a certain object should be added to or removed from the previously reported …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,535
A peer-to-peer spatial cloaking algorithm for anonymous location-based service,Chi-Yin Chow; Mohamed F Mokbel; Xuan Liu,Abstract This paper tackles a major privacy threat in current location-based services whereusers have to report their exact locations to the database server in order to obtain theirdesired services. For example; a mobile user asking about her nearest restaurant has toreport her exact location. With untrusted service providers; reporting private locationinformation may lead to several privacy threats. In this paper; we present a peer-to-peer(P2P) spatial cloaking algorithm in which mobile and stationary users can entertain location-based services without revealing their exact location information. The main idea is thatbefore requesting any location-based service; the mobile user will form a group from herpeers via single-hop communication and/or multi-hop routing. Then; the spatial cloaked areais computed as the region that covers the entire group of peers. Two modes of operations …,Proceedings of the 14th annual ACM international symposium on Advances in geographic information systems,2006,524
Location-based and preference-aware recommendation using sparse geo-social networking data,Jie Bao; Yu Zheng; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract The popularity of location-based social networks provide us with a new platform tounderstand users' preferences based on their location histories. In this paper; we present alocation-based and preference-aware recommender system that offers a particular user aset of venues (such as restaurants) within a geospatial range with the consideration of both:1) User preferences; which are automatically learned from her location history and 2) Socialopinions; which are mined from the location histories of the local experts. This recommendersystem can facilitate people's travel not only near their living areas but also to a city that isnew to them. As a user can only visit a limited number of locations; the user-locations matrixis very sparse; leading to a big challenge to traditional collaborative filtering-based locationrecommender systems. The problem becomes even more challenging when people …,Proceedings of the 20th international conference on advances in geographic information systems,2012,446
Spatio-temporal access methods,Mohamed F.  Mokbel; Thanaa M.  Ghanem; Walid G.  Aref,Abstract The rapid increase in spatio-temporal applications calls for new auxiliary indexingstructures. A typical spatio-temporal application is one that tracks the behavior of movingobjects through location-aware devices (eg; GPS). Through the last decade; many spatio-temporal access methods are developed. Spatio-temporal access methods focus on twoorthogonal directions:(1) Indexing the past;(2) Indexing the current and predicted futurepositions. In this short survey; we classify spatio-temporal access methods for each directionbased on their underlying structure with a brief discussion of future research directions.,IEEE Data Eng.

Sea-cnn: Scalable processing of continuous k-nearest neighbor queries in spatio-temporal databases,Xiaopeng Xiong; Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref,Location-aware environments are characterized by a large number of objects and a largenumber of continuous queries. Both the objects and continuous queries may change theirlocations over time. In this paper; we focus on continuous k-nearest neighbor queries(CKNN; for short). We present a new algorithm; termed SEA-CNN; for answeringcontinuously a collection of concurrent CKNN queries. SEA-CNN has two important features:incremental evaluation and shared execution. SEA-CNN achieves both efficiency andscalability in the presence of a set of concurrent queries. Furthermore; SEA-CNN does notmake any assumptions about the movement of objects; eg; the objects velocities and shapesof trajectories; or about the mutability of the objects and/or the queries; ie; moving orstationary queries issued on moving or stationary objects. We provide theoretical analysis …,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005. Proceedings. 21st International Conference on,2005,377
Enabling private continuous queries for revealed user locations,Chi-Yin Chow; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract Existing location-based services provide specialized services to their customersbased on the knowledge of their exact locations. With untrustworthy servers; location-basedservices may lead to several privacy threats ranging from worries over employers snoopingon their workers' whereabouts to fears of tracking by potential stalkers. While there existseveral techniques to preserve location privacy in mobile environments; these techniquesare limited as they do not distinguish between location privacy (ie; a user wants to hide herlocation) and query privacy (ie; a user can reveal her location but not her query). Thisdistinction is crucial in many applications where the locations of mobile users are publiclyknown. In this paper; we go beyond the limitation of existing cloaking algorithms as wepropose a new robust spatial cloaking technique for snapshot and continuous location …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2007,274

Traditional recommender systems do not considerspatial properties of users nor items; LARS; on the other hand; supports a taxonomy of threenovel classes of location-based ratings; namely; spatial ratings for non-spatial items; non-spatial ratings for spatial items; and spatial ratings for spatial items. LARS exploits userrating locations through user partitioning; a technique that influences recommendations withratings spatially close to querying users in a manner that maximizes system scalability whilenot sacrificing recommendation quality.

Recommendations in location-based social networks: a survey,Jie Bao; Yu Zheng; David Wilkie; Mohamed Mokbel,Abstract Recent advances in localization techniques have fundamentally enhanced socialnetworking services; allowing users to share their locations and location-related contents;such as geo-tagged photos and notes. We refer to these social networks as location-basedsocial networks (LBSNs). Location data bridges the gap between the physical and digitalworlds and enables a deeper understanding of users' preferences and behavior. Thisaddition of vast geo-spatial datasets has stimulated research into novel recommendersystems that seek to facilitate users' travels and social interactions. In this paper; we offer asystematic review of this research; summarizing the contributions of individual efforts andexploring their relations. We discuss the new properties and challenges that location bringsto recommender systems for LBSNs. We present a comprehensive survey analyzing 1) …,GeoInformatica,2015,212
Casper*: Query processing for location services without compromising privacy,Chi-Yin Chow; Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref,Abstract In this article; we present a new privacy-aware query processing framework;Capser*; in which mobile and stationary users can obtain snapshot and/or continuouslocation-based services without revealing their private location information. In particular; wepropose a privacy-aware query processor embedded inside a location-based databaseserver to deal with snapshot and continuous queries based on the knowledge of the user'scloaked location rather than the exact location. Our proposed privacy-aware queryprocessor is completely independent of how we compute the user's cloaked location. Inother words; any existing location anonymization algorithms that blur the user's privatelocation into cloaked rectilinear areas can be employed to protect the user's location privacy.We first propose a privacy-aware query processor that not only supports three new …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2009,191

A demonstration of spatialhadoop: An efficient mapreduce framework for spatial data,Ahmed Eldawy; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract This demo presents SpatialHadoop as the first full-fledged MapReduce frameworkwith native support for spatial data. SpatialHadoop is a comprehensive extension to Hadoopthat pushes spatial data inside the core functionality of Hadoop. SpatialHadoop runs existingHadoop programs as is; yet; it achieves order (s) of magnitude better performance thanHadoop when dealing with spatial data. SpatialHadoop employs a simple spatial high levellanguage; a two-level spatial index structure; basic spatial components built inside theMapReduce layer; and three basic spatial operations: range queries; k-NN queries; andspatial join. Other spatial operations can be similarly deployed in SpatialHadoop.

Probabilistic verifiers: Evaluating constrained nearest-neighbor queries over uncertain data,Reynold Cheng; Jinchuan Chen; Mohamed Mokbel; Chi-Yin Chow,In applications like location-based services; sensor monitoring and biological databases; thevalues of the database items are inherently uncertain in nature. An important query foruncertain objects is the Probabilistic Nearest-Neighbor Query (PNN); which computes theprobability of each object for being the nearest neighbor of a query point. Evaluating thisquery is computationally expensive; since it needs to consider the relationship amonguncertain objects; and requires the use of numerical integration or Monte-Carlo methods.Sometimes; a query user may not be concerned about the exact probability values. Forexample; he may only need answers that have sufficiently high confidence. We thus proposethe Constrained Nearest-Neighbor Query (C-PNN); which returns the IDs of objects whoseprobabilities are higher than some threshold; with a given error bound in the answers …,Data Engineering; 2008.

Hash-merge join: A non-blocking join algorithm for producing fast and early join results,Mohamed F Mokbel; Ming Lu; Walid G Aref,We introduce the hash-merge join algorithm (HMJ; for short); a new nonblocking joinalgorithm that deals with data items from remote sources via unpredictable; slow; or burstynetwork traffic. The HMJ algorithm is designed with two goals in mind:(1) minimize the timeto produce the first few results; and (2) produce join results even if the two sources of the joinoperator occasionally get blocked. The HMJ algorithm has two phases: The hashing phaseand the merging phase. The hashing phase employs an in-memory hash-based joinalgorithm that produces join results as quickly as data arrives. The merging phase isresponsible for producing join results if the two sources are blocked. Both phases of the HMJalgorithm are connected via a flushing policy that flushes in-memory parts into disk storageonce the memory is exhausted. Experimental results show that HMJ combines the …,Data Engineering; 2004. Proceedings. 20th International Conference on,2004,152
Continuous evaluation of monochromatic and bichromatic reverse nearest neighbors,James M Kang; Mohamed F Mokbel; Shashi Shekhar; Tian Xia; Donghui Zhang,This paper presents a novel algorithm for Incremental and General Evaluation of continuousReverse Nearest neighbor queries (IGERN; for short). The IGERN algorithm is general as itis applicable for both the monochromatic and bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor queries.The incremental aspect of IGERN is achieved through determining only a small set ofobjects to be monitored. While previous algorithms for monochromatic queries rely mainlyon monitoring six pie regions; IGERN takes a radical approach by monitoring only a singleregion around the query object. The IGERN algorithm clearly outperforms the state-of-the-artalgorithms in monochromatic queries. In addition; the IGERN algorithm presents the firstattempt for continuous evaluation of bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor queries. Thecomputational complexity of IGERN is presented in comparison to the state-of-the-art …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007. IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,141

Spatial cloaking for anonymous location-based services in mobile peer-to-peer environments,Chi-Yin Chow; Mohamed F Mokbel; Xuan Liu,Abstract This paper tackles a privacy breach in current location-based services (LBS) wheremobile users have to report their exact location information to an LBS provider in order toobtain their desired services. For example; a user who wants to issue a query asking abouther nearest gas station has to report her exact location to an LBS provider. However; manyrecent research efforts have indicated that revealing private location information topotentially untrusted LBS providers may lead to major privacy breaches. To preserve userlocation privacy; spatial cloaking is the most commonly used privacy-enhancing technique inLBS. The basic idea of the spatial cloaking technique is to blur a user's exact location into acloaked area that satisfies the user specified privacy requirements. Unfortunately; existingspatial cloaking algorithms designed for LBS rely on fixed communication infrastructure …,GeoInformatica,2011,136
Trajectory privacy in location-based services and data publication,Chi-Yin Chow; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract The ubiquity of mobile devices with global positioning functionality (eg; GPS andAGPS) and Internet connectivity (eg; 3G andWi-Fi) has resulted in widespread developmentof location-based services (LBS). Typical examples of LBS include local business search; e-marketing; social networking; and automotive traffic monitoring. Although LBS providevaluable services for mobile users; revealing their private locations to potentially untrustedLBS service providers pose privacy concerns. In general; there are two types of LBS;namely; snapshot and continuous LBS. For snapshot LBS; a mobile user only needs toreport its current location to a service provider once to get its desired information. On theother hand; a mobile user has to report its location to a service provider in a periodic or on-demand manner to obtain its desired continuous LBS.

Skyline query processing for incomplete data,Mohamed E Khalefa; Mohamed F Mokbel; Justin J Levandoski,Recently; there has been much interest in processing skyline queries for variousapplications that include decision making; personalized services; and search pruning.Skyline queries aim to prune a search space of large numbers of multi-dimensional dataitems to a small set of interesting items by eliminating items that are dominated by others.Existing skyline algorithms assume that all dimensions are available for all data items. Thispaper goes beyond this restrictive assumption as we address the more practical case ofinvolving incomplete data items (ie; data items missing values in some of their dimensions).In contrast to the case of complete data where the dominance relation is transitive;incomplete data suffer from non-transitive dominance relation which may lead to a cyclicdominance behavior.

Analysis of multi-dimensional space-filling curves,Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref; Ibrahim Kamel,Abstract A space-filling curve is a way of mapping the multi-dimensional space into the 1-Dspace. It acts like a thread that passes through every cell element (or pixel) in the D-dimensional space so that every cell is visited exactly once. There are numerous kinds ofspace-filling curves. The difference between such curves is in their way of mapping to the 1-D space. Selecting the appropriate curve for any application requires knowledge of themapping scheme provided by each space-filling curve. A space-filling curve consists of a setof segments. Each segment connects two consecutive multi-dimensional points. Fivedifferent types of segments are distinguished; namely; Jump; Contiguity; Reverse; Forward;and Still. A description vector V=(J; C; R; F; S); where J; C; R; F; and S are the percentagesof Jump; Contiguity; Reverse; Forward; and Still segments in the space-filling curve …,GeoInformatica,2003,120
Deuteronomy: Transaction support for cloud data,Justin Levandoski; David Lomet; Kevin Keliang Zhao,Abstract The Deuteronomy system supports efficient and scalable ACID transactions in thecloud by decomposing functions of a database storage engine kernel into:(a) a transactionalcomponent (TC) that manages transactions and their “logical” concurrency control andundo/redo recovery; but knows nothing about physical data location and (b) a datacomponent (DC) that maintains a data cache and uses access methods to support a record-oriented interface with atomic operations; but knows nothing about transactions. TheDeuteronomy TC can be applied to data anywhere (in the cloud; local; etc.) with a variety ofdeployments for both the TC and DC. In this paper; we describe the architecture of our TC;and the considerations that led to it.

SOLE: scalable on-line execution of continuous queries on spatio-temporal data streams,Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref,Abstract This paper presents the scalable on-line execution (SOLE) algorithm for continuousand on-line evaluation of concurrent continuous spatio-temporal queries over data streams.Incoming spatio-temporal data streams are processed in-memory against a set ofoutstanding continuous queries. The SOLE algorithm utilizes the scarce memory resourceefficiently by keeping track of only the significant objects. In-memory stored objects areexpired (ie; dropped) from memory once they become insignificant. SOLE is a scalablealgorithm where all the continuous outstanding queries share the same buffer pool. Inaddition; SOLE is presented as a spatio-temporal join between two input streams; a streamof spatio-temporal objects and a stream of spatio-temporal queries. To cope with intervals ofhigh arrival rates of objects and/or queries; SOLE utilizes a load-shedding approach …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2008,102
Towards privacy-aware location-based database servers,Mohamed F Mokbel,The wide spread of location-based services results in a strong market for location-detectiondevices (eg; GPS-like devices; RFIDs; handheld devices; and cellular phones). Examples oflocation-based services include location-aware emergency service; location-basedadvertisement; live traffic reports; and location-based store finder. However; location-detection devices pose a major privacy threat on its users where it transmits privateinformation (ie; the location) to the server who may be untrustworthy. The existing model oflocation-based applications trades service with privacy where if a user wants to keep herprivate location information; she has to turn off her location-detection device; ie; unsubscribefrom the service. This paper tackles this model in a way that protects the user privacy whilekeeping the functionality of location-based services.

Spatio-temporal access methods: Part 2 (2003-2010),Long-Van Nguyen-Dinh; Walid G Aref; Mohamed Mokbel,Abstract In spatio-temporal applications; moving objects detect their locations via location-aware devices and update their locations continuously to the server. With the ubiquity andmassive numbers of moving objects; many spatio-temporal access methods are developedto process user queries efficiently. Spatio-temporal access methods are classified into fourcategories:(1) Indexing the past data;(2) Indexing the current data;(3) Indexing the futuredata; and (4) Indexing data at all points of time.

In our system; we design two in-network locationanonymization algorithms; namely; resource and quality-aware algorithms; that aim toenable the system to provide high-quality location monitoring services for system users;while preserving personal location privacy. Both algorithms rely on the well-established k-anonymity privacy concept; that is; a person is indistinguishable among k persons; to enabletrusted sensor nodes to provide the aggregate location information of monitored persons forour system. Each aggregate location is in a form of a monitored area A along with thenumber of monitored persons residing in A; where A contains at least k persons.

Incremental evaluation of sliding-window queries over data streams,Thanaa M Ghanem; Moustafa A Hammad; Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref; Ahmed K Elmagarmid,Two research efforts have been conducted to realize sliding-window queries in data streammanagement systems; namely; query revaluation and incremental evaluation. In the queryreevaluation method; two consecutive windows are processed independently of each other.On the other hand; in the incremental evaluation method; the query answer for a window isobtained incrementally from the answer of the preceding window. In this paper; we focus onthe incremental evaluation method. Two approaches have been adopted for the incrementalevaluation of sliding-window queries; namely; the input-triggered approach and the negativetuples approach.

Toward context and preference-aware location-based services,Mohamed F Mokbel; Justin J Levandoski,Abstract The explosive growth of location-detection devices; wireless communications; andmobile databases has resulted in the realization of location-based services as commercialproducts and research prototypes. Unfortunately; current location-based applications (eg;store finders) are rigid as they are completely isolated from various concepts of user"preferences" and/or" context". Such rigidness results in nonsuitable services (eg; avegetarian user may get a restaurant with non-vegetarian menu).

The PLACE serversupports a wide variety of stationery and moving continuous spatio-temporal queriesthrough a set of pipelined spatio-temporal operators.

Query-aware location anonymization for road networks,Chi-Yin Chow; Mohamed F Mokbel; Jie Bao; Xuan Liu,Abstract Recently; several techniques have been proposed to protect the user locationprivacy for location-based services in the Euclidean space. Applying these techniquesdirectly to the road network environment would lead to privacy leakage and inefficient queryprocessing. In this paper; we propose a new location anonymization algorithm that isdesigned specifically for the road network environment. Our algorithm relies on thecommonly used concept of spatial cloaking; where a user location is cloaked into a set ofconnected road segments of a minimum total length \calL including at least \calK users. Ouralgorithm is “query-aware” as it takes into account the query execution cost at a databaseserver and the query quality; ie; the number of objects returned to users by the databaseserver; during the location anonymization process. In particular; we develop a new cost …,GeoInformatica,2011,62
NILE-PDT: A phenomenon detection and tracking framework for data stream management systems,Mohamed H Ali; Walid G Aref; Raja Bose; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Abdelsalam Helal; Ibrahim Kamel; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract In this demo; we present Nile-PDT; a Phenomenon Detection and Trackingframework using the Nile data stream management system. A phenomenon is characterizedby a group of streams showing similar behavior over a period of time. The functionalities ofNile-PDT is split between the Nile server and the Nile-PDT application client. At the serverside; Nile detects phenomenon candidate members and tracks their propagationincrementally through specific sensor network operators. Phenomenon candidate membersare processed at the client side to detect phenomena of interest to a particular application.Nile-PDT is scalable in the number of sensors; the sensor data rates; and the number ofphenomena. Guided by the detected phenomena; Nile-PDT tunes query processing towardssensors that heavily affect the monitoring of phenomenon propagation.,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,62
Geofeed: A location aware news feed system,Jie Bao; Mohamed F Mokbel; Chi-Yin Chow,This paper presents the Geo Feed system; a location-aware news feed system that providesa new platform for its users to get spatially related message updates from either their friendsor favorite news sources. Geo Feed distinguishes itself from all existing news feed systemsin that it takes into account the spatial extents of messages and user locations whendeciding upon the selected news feed. Geo Feed is equipped with three differentapproaches for delivering the news feed to its users; namely; spatial pull; spatial push; andshared push. Then; the main challenge of Geo Feed is to decide on when to use each ofthese three approaches to which users. Geo Feed is equipped with a smart decision modelthat decides about using these approaches in a way that:(a) minimizes the system overheadfor delivering the location-aware news feed; and (b) guarantees a certain response time …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,61
RDF data-centric storage,Justin J Levandoski; Mohamed F Mokbel,The vision of the Semantic Web has brought about new challenges at the intersection of webresearch and data management. One fundamental research issue at this intersection is thestorage of the Resource Description Framework (RDF) data: the model at the core of theSemantic Web. We present a data-centric approach for storage of RDF in relationaldatabases. The intuition behind our approach is that each RDF dataset requires a tailoredtable schema that achieves efficient query processing by (1) reducing the need for joins inthe query plan and (2) keeping null storage below a given threshold. Using a basic structurederived from the RDF data; we propose a two-phase algorithm involving clustering andpartitioning. The clustering phase aims to reduce the need for joins in a query. Thepartitioning phase aims to optimize storage of extra (ie; null) data in the underlying …,Web Services; 2009. ICWS 2009. IEEE International Conference on,2009,60
Scalable spatio-temporal continuous query processing for location-aware services,Xiaopeng Xiong; Mohamed F Mokbel; WC Aref; Susanne E Hambrusch; Sunil Prabhakar,Real-time spatio-temporal query processing needs to effectively handle a large number ofmoving objects and continuous spatio-temporal queries. In this paper; we use sharedexecution as a mechanism to support scalability in location-aware servers. Our main idea isto maintain a query table that stores information about continuous spatio-temporal queries.Then; answering spatio-temporal queries is abstracted as a spatial join among the movingobjects and queries. Three query join policies are proposed aiming to minimize the cost ofthe join operation under the shared execution paradigm; namely the clock-triggered joinpolicy; the incremental join policy; and the hot join policy. We introduce the concept of a no-action region that is used in conjunction with the hot join policy. We propose algorithms thatcalculate the no-action region for objects and queries.

LUGrid: Update-tolerant grid-based indexing for moving objects,Xiaopeng Xiong; Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref,Indexing moving objects is a fundamental issue in spatiotemporal databases. In this paper;we propose an adaptive Lazy-Update Grid-based index (LUGrid; for short) that minimizesthe cost of object updates. LUGrid is designed with two important features; namely; lazyinsertion and lazy deletion. Lazy insertion reduces the update I/Os by adding an additionalmemory-resident layer over the disk index. Lazy deletion reduces update cost by avoidingdeleting single obsolete entry immediately. Instead; the obsolete entries are removed laterby specially designed mechanisms. LUGrid adapts to object distributions through cellsplitting and merging. Theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that LUGridoutperforms former work by up to eight times when processing intensive updates; whileyielding similar search performance.,Mobile Data Management; 2006.

Efficient evaluation of k-range nearest neighbor queries in road networks,Jie Bao; Chi-Yin Chow; Mohamed F Mokbel; Wei-Shinn Ku,A k-Range Nearest Neighbor (or kRNN for short) query in road networks finds the k nearestneighbors of every point on the road segments within a given query region based on thenetwork distance. The kRNN query is significantly important for location-based applicationsin many realistic scenarios. For example;(1) the user's location is uncertain; ie; user'slocation is modeled by a spatial region; and (2) the user is not willing to reveal her exactlocation to preserve her privacy; ie; her location is blurred into a spatial region. However; theexisting solutions for kRNN queries simply apply the traditional k-nearest neighbor queryprocessing algorithm multiple times; which poses a huge redundant searching overhead. Tothis end; we propose an efficient kRNN query processing algorithm in this paper. Ouralgorithm (1) employs a shared execution approach to eliminate the redundant searching …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2010 Eleventh International Conference on,2010,53
Sindbad: a location-based social networking system,Mohamed Sarwat; Jie Bao; Ahmed Eldawy; Justin J Levandoski; Amr Magdy; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract This demo presents Sindbad; a location-based social networking system. Sindbadsupports three new services beyond traditional social networking services; namely; location-aware news feed; location-aware recommender; and location-aware ranking. These newservices not only consider social relevance for its users; but they also consider spatialrelevance. Since location-aware social networking systems have to deal with large numberof users; large number of messages; and user mobility; efficiency and scalability areimportant issues. To this end; Sindbad encapsulates its three main services inside the queryprocessing engine of PostgreSQL. Usage and internal functionality of Sindbad; implementedwith PostgreSQL and Google Maps API; are demonstrated through user (ie; web/phone) andsystem analyzer GUI interfaces; respectively.,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,52
Privacy in location-based services: a system architecture perspective,Chi-Yin Chow; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract Location-based services (LBS; for short) are information and entertainment servicesthat are conveniently accessible by mobile users through GPS-enabled portable devicesand mobile networks (eg; 2G/3G cellular telephone and Wi-Fi networks). Examples of LBSinclude resource finding (eg; where is my nearest gas station); route finding (eg; what is theshortest route from my current location to a shopping mall; social networking (eg; where aremy friends); and location-based gaming (eg; GPS online game). LBS rely mainly on animplicit assumption that mobile users are willing to reveal their private locations. Withuntrustworthy LBS providers; the revealed private location information could be abused byadversaries. For example; an adversary may infer a user's medical record by knowing thatshe regularly visits a specialized clinic. There are already several life scenarios that took …,Sigspatial Special,2009,51
FlexPref: A framework for extensible preference evaluation in database systems,Justin J Levandoski; Mohamed F Mokbel; Mohamed E Khalefa,Personalized database systems give users answers tailored to their personal preferences.While numerous preference evaluation methods for databases have been proposed (eg;skyline; top-k; k-dominance; k-frequency); the implementation of these methods at the coreof a database system is a double-edged sword. Core implementation provides efficientquery processing for arbitrary database queries; however this approach is not practical aseach existing (and future) preference method requires a custom query processorimplementation. To solve this problem; this paper introduces FlexPref; a framework forextensible preference evaluation in database systems. FlexPref; implemented in the queryprocessor; aims to support a wide-array of preference evaluation methods in a singleextensible code base. Integration with FlexPref is simple; involving the registration of only …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,49
SARD: A statistical approach for ranking database tuning parameters,Biplob K Debnath; David J Lilja; Mohamed F Mokbel,Traditionally; DBMSs are shipped with hundreds of configuration parameters. Since thedatabase performance highly depends on the appropriate settings of the configurationparameters; DBAs spend a lot of their time and effort to find the best parameter values fortuning the performance of the application of interest. In many cases; they rely on theirexperience and some rules of thumbs. However; time and effort may be wasted by tuningthose parameters which may have no or marginal effects. Moreover; tuning effects also varydepending on the expertise of the DBAs; but skilled DBAs are increasingly becoming rareand expensive to employ. To address these problems; we present a Statistical Approach forRanking Database parameters (SARD); which is based on the Plackett & Burman statisticaldesign methodology.

Towards scalable location-aware services: requirements and research issues,Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref; Susanne E Hambrusch; Sunil Prabhakar,Abstract The emergence of location-aware services calls for new real time spatio-temporalquery processing algorithms that deal with large numbers of mobile objects and queries.Online query response is an important characterization of location-aware services. A delayin the answer to a query gives invalid and obsolete results; simply because moving objectscan change their locations before the query responds. To handle large numbers of spatio-temporal queries efficiently; we propose the idea of sharing as a means to achievescalability. In this paper; we introduce several types of sharing in the context of continuousspatio-temporal queries. Examples of sharing in the context of real-time spatio-temporaldatabase systems include sharing the execution; sharing the underlying space; sharing thesliding time windows; and sharing the objects of interest. We demonstrate how sharing …,Proceedings of the 11th ACM international symposium on Advances in geographic information systems,2003,48
StreamRec: a real-time recommender system,Badrish Chandramouli; Justin J Levandoski; Ahmed Eldawy; Mohamed F Mokbel,Research and development of recommender systems has been a vibrant field for over adecade; having produced proven methods for “preference-aware” computing.Recommenders use community opinion histories to help users identify interesting items froma considerably large search space (eg; inventory from Amazon [7]; movies from Netflix [9]).Personalization; recommendation; and the “human side" of data-centric applications arealso becoming important topics in the data management community [3].

Pigeon: A spatial mapreduce language,Ahmed Eldawy; Mohamed F Mokbel,With the huge amounts of spatial data collected everyday; MapReduce frameworks; such asHadoop; have become a common choice to analyze big spatial data for scientists andpeople from industry. Users prefer to use high level languages; such as Pig Latin; to dealwith Hadoop for simplicity. Unfortunately; these languages are designed for primitive non-spatial data and have no support for spatial data types or functions. This demonstrationpresents Pigeon; a spatial extension to Pig which provides spatial functionality in Pig.Pigeon is implemented through user defined functions (UDFs) making it easy to use andcompatible with all recent versions of Pig. This also allows it to integrate smoothly withexisting non-spatial functions and operations such as Filter; Join and Group By.

On efficient and scalable support of continuous queries in mobile peer-to-peer environments,Chi-Yin Chow; Mohamed F Mokbel; Hong Va Leong,In this paper; we propose an efficient and scalable query processing framework forcontinuous spatial queries (range and k-nearest-neighbor queries) in mobile peer-to-peer(P2P) environments; where no fixed communication infrastructure or centralized/distributedservers are available. Due to the limitations in mobile P2P environments; for example; usermobility; limited battery power; limited communication range; and scarce communicationbandwidth; it is costly to maintain the exact answer of continuous spatial queries. To thisend; our framework enables the user to find an approximate answer with quality guarantees.In particular; we design two key features to adapt continuous spatial query processing tomobile P2P environments. 1) Each mobile user can specify his or her desired quality ofservices (QoS) for a query answer in a personalized QoS profile.

GPAC: generic and progressive processing of mobile queries over mobile data,Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref,Abstract This paper introduces a new family of Generic and Progressive algorithms (GPAC;for short) for continuous mobile queries over mobile objects. GPAC provides a generalskeleton that can be tuned through a set of methods to behave as various continuousqueries (eg; continuous range queries and continuous k-nearest-neighbor queries). GPACalgorithms aim to provide three goals:(1) Online evaluation through an in-memoryprocessing of the incoming mobile data.(2) Progressive evaluation through employing anincremental evaluation paradigm.(3) Fast query response through employing an anticipationparadigm. Query answer is anticipated and is cached in memory to allow for fast evaluation.GPAC algorithms are encapsulated in physical pipelined query operators.

Automatically and accurately conflating raster maps with orthoimagery,Ching-Chien Chen; Craig A Knoblock; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Recent growth of geospatial information online has made it possible to accessvarious maps and orthoimagery. Conflating these maps and imagery can create images thatcombine the visual appeal of imagery with the attribution information from maps. Theexisting systems require human intervention to conflate maps with imagery. We present anovel approach that utilizes vector datasets as “glue” to automatically conflate street mapswith imagery. First; our approach extracts road intersections from imagery and maps ascontrol points. Then; it aligns the two point sets by computing the matched point pattern.Finally; it aligns maps with imagery based on the matched pattern. The experiments showthat our approach can conflate various maps with imagery; such that in our experiments onTIGER-maps covering part of St. Louis county; MO; 85.2% of the conflated map roads are …,GeoInformatica,2008,41

Detection and Tracking of Discrete Phenomena in Sensor-Network Databases.,Mohamed H Ali; Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref; Ibrahim Kamel,Abstract This paper introduces a framework for Phenomena Detection and Tracking (PDT;for short) in sensor network databases. Examples of detectable phenomena include thepropagation over time of a pollution cloud or an oil spill region. We provide a crisp definitionof a phenomenon that takes into consideration both the strength and the time span of thephenomenon. We focus on discrete phenomena where sensor readings are drawn from adiscrete set of values; eg; item numbers or pollutant IDs; and we point out how our work canbe extended to handle continuous phenomena. The challenge for the proposed PDTframework is to detect as much phenomena as possible; given the large number of sensors;the overall high arrival rates of sensor data; and the limited system resources. Our proposedPDT framework uses continuous SQL queries to detect and track phenomena. Execution …,SSDBM,2005,37
Spatial partitioning techniques in SpatialHadoop,Ahmed Eldawy; Louai Alarabi; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract SpatialHadoop is an extended MapReduce framework that supports globalindexing that spatial partitions the data across machines providing orders of magnitudespeedup; compared to traditional Hadoop. In this paper; we describe seven alternativepartitioning techniques and experimentally study their effect on the quality of the generatedindex and the performance of range and spatial join queries. We found that using a 1%sample is enough to produce high quality partitions. Also; we found that the total area ofpartitions is a reasonable measure of the quality of indexes when running spatial join. Thisstudy will assist researchers in choosing a good spatial partitioning technique in distributedenvironments.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,36
On accurate and efficient statistical counting in sensor-based surveillance systems,Shuo Guo; Tian He; Mohamed F Mokbel; John A Stankovic; Tarek F Abdelzaher,Abstract Sensor networks have been used in many surveillance systems; providingstatistical information about monitored areas. Accurate counting information (eg; thedistribution of the total number of targets) is often important for decision making. As acomplementary solution to double-counting in communication; this paper presents the firstwork that deals with double-counting in sensing for wireless sensor networks. Theprobability mass function (pmf) of target counts is derived first. This; however; is shown to becomputationally prohibitive when a network becomes large. A partitioning algorithm is thendesigned to significantly reduce computation complexity with a certain loss in countingaccuracy. Finally; two methods are proposed to compensate for the loss. To evaluate thedesign; we compare the derived probability mass function with ground truth obtained …,Pervasive and Mobile Computing,2010,36
Real-time street parking availability estimation,Bo Xu; Ouri Wolfson; Jie Yang; Leon Stenneth; S Yu Philip; Peter C Nelson,Real-time parking availability information is important in urban areas; and if available couldreduce congestion; pollution; and gas consumption. In this paper; we present a softwaresolution called PhonePark for detecting the availability of on-street parking spaces. Thesolution uses the GPS and/or accelerometer sensors in a traveler's mobile phone toautomatically detect when and where the traveler parked her car; and when she released aparking slot. PhonePark can also utilize the mobile phone's Bluetooth sensor or piggybackon street parking payment transactions for parking activity detection.

Mercury: A memory-constrained spatio-temporal real-time search on microblogs,Amr Magdy; Mohamed F Mokbel; Sameh Elnikety; Suman Nath; Yuxiong He,This paper presents Mercury; a system for real-time support of top-k spatio-temporal querieson microblogs; where users are able to browse recent microblogs near their locations. Withhigh arrival rates of microblogs; Mercury ensures real-time query response within a tightmemory-constrained environment. Mercury bounds its search space to include only thosemicroblogs that have arrived within certain spatial and temporal boundaries; in which onlythe top-k microblogs; according to a spatio-temporal ranking function; are returned in thesearch results. Mercury employs:(a) a scalable dynamic in-memory index structure that iscapable of digesting all incoming microblogs;(b) an efficient query processor that exploitsthe in-memory index through spatio-temporal pruning techniques that reduce the number ofvisited microblogs to return the final answer;(c) an index size tuning module that …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,34
Horton+: a distributed system for processing declarative reachability queries over partitioned graphs,Mohamed Sarwat; Sameh Elnikety; Yuxiong He; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract Horton+ is a graph query processing system that executes declarative reachabilityqueries on a partitioned attributed multi-graph. It employs a query language; queryoptimizer; and a distributed execution engine. The query language expresses declarativereachability queries; and supports closures and predicates on node and edge attributes tomatch graph paths. We introduce three algebraic operators; select; traverse; and join; and aquery is compiled into an execution plan containing these operators. As reachability queriesaccess the graph elements in a random access pattern; the graph is therefore maintained inthe main memory of a cluster of servers to reduce query execution time. We develop adistributed execution engine that processes a query plan in parallel on the graph servers.Since the query language is declarative; we build a query optimizer that uses graph …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,34
MNTG: an extensible web-based traffic generator,Mohamed F Mokbel; Louai Alarabi; Jie Bao; Ahmed Eldawy; Amr Magdy; Mohamed Sarwat; Ethan Waytas; Steven Yackel,Abstract Road network traffic datasets have attracted significant attention in the past decade.For instance; in spatio-temporal databases area; researchers harness road network trafficdata to evaluate and validate their research. Collecting real traffic datasets is tedious as itusually takes a significant amount of time and effort. Alternatively; many researchers opt togenerate synthetic traffic data using existing traffic generation tools; eg; Brinkhoff andBerlinMOD. Unfortunately; existing road network traffic generators require significant amountof time and effort to install; configure; and run. Moreover; it is not trivial to generate trafficdata in arbitrary spatial regions using existing traffic generators.

Identifying unsafe routes for network-based trajectory privacy,Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Vassilios S Verykios; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract In this paper; we propose a privacy model that offers trajectory privacy to therequesters of Location-Based Services (LBSs); by utilizing an underlying network of usermovement. The privacy model has been implemented as a framework that (i) reconstructsthe user movement from a series of independent location updates;(ii) identifies routes whereuser privacy is at risk; and (iii) anonymizes online user requests for LBSs to protect therequester for as long as the service withstands completion. In order to achieve (iii); wepropose two anonymization techniques; the K–present (weak) and the K–frequent (strong)trajectory anonymity; and a second chance approach that takes over when anonymizationfails to ensure that the privacy of the user is preserved. To the best of our knowledge; this isthe first work to propose a trajectory privacy model that utilizes an underlying network of …,*,2009,33
Challenges in preserving location privacy in peer-to-peer environments,Mohamed F Mokbel; Chi-Yin Chow,In location-based services (LBS); users have to continuously report their locations to thedatabase server to entertain the service. For example; a user asking about her nearest gasstation has to report her exact location to the database server. With untrustworthy servers;LBS may pose a major privacy threat on its users. In other words; the existing model of LBStrades service for user privacy. To tackle this privacy threat; several centralized privacy-preserving frameworks are proposed for LBS; in which a third trusted party is used as amiddleware to blur user exact locations into spatial regions; in order to achieve k-anonymity;ie; a user is indistinguishable among other k-1 users. However; the centralized third trustedparty could be the system bottleneck or single point of failure.

Approximate evaluation of range nearest neighbor queries with quality guarantee,Chi-Yin Chow; Mohamed F Mokbel; Joe Naps; Suman Nath,Abstract The range nearest-neighbor (NN) query is an important query type in location-based services; as it can be applied to the case that an NN query has a spatial region;instead of a location point; as the query location. Examples of the applications of range NNqueries include uncertain locations and privacy-preserving queries. Given a set of objects;the range NN answer is a set of objects that includes the nearest object (s) to every point in agiven spatial region. The answer set size would significantly increase as the spatial regiongets larger. Unfortunately; mobile users in wireless environments suffer from scarcebandwidth and low-quality communication; transmitting a large answer set from a databaseserver to the user would pose very high response time. To this end; we propose anapproximate range NN query processing algorithm to balance a performance tradeoff …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2009,32
Performance of multi-dimensional space-filling curves,Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref; Ibrahim Kamel,Abstract A space-filling curve is a way of mapping the multi-dimensional space into the one-dimensional space. It acts like a thread that passes through every cell element (or pixel) inthe D-dimensional space so that every cell is visited exactly once. There are numerous kindsof space-filling curves. The difference between such curves is in their way of mapping to theone dimensional space. Selecting the appropriate curve for any application requiresknowledge of the mapping scheme provided by each space-filling curve. A space-fillingcurve consists of a set of segments. Each segment connects two consecutive multi-dimensional points. Five different types of segments are distinguished; namely; Jump;Contiguity; Reverse; Forward; and Still.

Irregularity in multi-dimensional space-filling curves with applications in multimedia databases,Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref,Abstract A space-filling curve is a way of mapping the multi-dimensional space into the one-dimensional space. It acts like a thread that passes through every cell element (or pixel) inthe N-dimensional space so that every cell is visited at least once. Thus; a space-filling curveimposes a linear order of the cells in the N-dimensional space. There are numerous kinds ofspace-filling curves. The difference between such curves is in their way of mapping to theone-dimensional space. Selecting the appropriate curve for any application requires a briefknowledge of the mapping scheme provided by each space-filling curve. Irregularity isproposed as a quantitative measure of the quality of the mapping of the space-filling curve.Closed formulas are developed to compute the irregularity for any general dimension D withN points in each dimension for different space-filling curves.

Skyline query processing for uncertain data,Mohamed E Khalefa; Mohamed F Mokbel; Justin J Levandoski,Abstract Recently; several research efforts have addressed answering skyline queriesefficiently over large datasets. However; this research lacks methods to compute thesequeries over uncertain data; where uncertain values are represented as a range. In thispaper; we define skyline queries over continuous uncertain data; and propose a novel;efficient framework to answer these queries. Query answers are probabilistic; where eachobject is associated with a probability value of being a query answer. Typically; users specifya probability threshold; that each returned object must exceed; and a tolerance value thatdefines the allowed error margin in probability calculation to reduce the computationaloverhead. Our framework employs an efficient two-phase query processing algorithm.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,31
Bulk operations for space-partitioning trees,Thanaa M Ghanem; Rahul Shah; Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref; Jeffrey Scott Vitter,The emergence of extensible index structures; eg; GiST (generalized search tree)[JMHellerstein et al.(1995)] and SP-GiST (space-partitioning generalized search tree)[W. G Arefet al.;(2001)]; calls for a set of extensible algorithms to support different operations (eg;insertion; deletion; and search). Extensible bulk operations (eg; bulk loading and bulkinsertion) are of the same importance and need to be supported in these index engines. Inthis paper; we propose two extensible buffer-based algorithms for bulk operations in theclass of space-partitioning trees; a class of hierarchical data structures that recursivelydecompose the space into disjoint partitions. The main idea of these algorithms is to build anin-memory tree of the target space-partitioning index. Then; data items are recursivelypartitioned into disk-based buffers using the in-memory tree.

Unlike existing location-based databasesystems that answer queries based solely on proximity in distance; CareDB considers userpreferences and various types of context in determining the answer to location-basedqueries. To this end; CareDB does not aim to define new location-based queries; instead; itaims to redefine the answer of existing location-based queries. To achieve its goals; CareDBhas several distinguishing characteristics that revolve around a generic and extensiblepreference and context-aware query processing framework that addresses (a) scalable;efficient preference joins;(b) gracefully handling contextual attributes that are expensive …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,30
A delay constrained shortest path algorithm for multicast routing in multimedia applications,Mohamed F Mokbel; Wafaa A El-Haweet; M Nazih El-Derini,Abstract A new heuristic algorithm is proposed for constructing multicast tree for multimediaand real-time applications. The tree is used to concurrently transmit packets from source tomultiple destinations such that exactly one copy of any packet traverses the links of themulticast tree. Since multimedia applications require some Quality of Service; QoS; amulticast tree is needed to satisfy two main goals; the minimum path cost from source toeach destination (Shortest Path Tree) and a certain end-to-end delay constraint from sourceto each destination.

Continuous aggregate nearest neighbor queries,Hicham G Elmongui; Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref,Abstract This paper addresses the problem of continuous aggregate nearest-neighbor(CANN) queries for moving objects in spatio-temporal data stream management systems. ACANN query specifies a set of landmarks; an integer k; and an aggregate distance function f(eg; min; max; or sum); where f computes the aggregate distance between a moving objectand each of the landmarks. The answer to this continuous query is the set of k movingobjects that have the smallest aggregate distance f. A CANN query may also be viewed as acombined set of nearest neighbor queries. We introduce several algorithms to continuouslyand incrementally answer CANN queries. Extensive experimentation shows that theproposed operators outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms by up to a factor of 3 and incurlow memory overhead.,GeoInformatica,2013,29
Shahed: A mapreduce-based system for querying and visualizing spatio-temporal satellite data,Ahmed Eldawy; Mohamed F Mokbel; Saif Alharthi; Abdulhadi Alzaidy; Kareem Tarek; Sohaib Ghani,Remote sensing data collected by satellites are now made publicly available by severalspace agencies. This data is very useful for scientists pursuing research in severalapplications including climate change; desertification; and land use change. The benefit ofthis data comes from its richness as it provides an archived history for over 15 years ofsatellite observations for natural phenomena such as temperature and vegetation.Unfortunately; the use of such data is very limited due to the huge size of archives (> 500TB)and the limited capabilities of traditional applications. This paper introduces SHAHED; aMapReduce-based system for querying; visualizing; and mining large scale satellite data.SHAHED considers both the spatial and temporal aspects of the data to provide efficientquery processing at large scale. The core of SHAHED is composed of four main …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,28
Panda: a predictive spatio-temporal query processor,Abdeltawab M Hendawi; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract This paper presents the Panda system for efficient support of a wide variety ofpredictive spatio-temporal queries that are widely used in several applications includingtraffic management; location-based advertising; and ride sharing. Unlike previous attemptsin supporting predictive queries; Panda targets long-term query prediction as it relies onadapting a well-designed long-term prediction function to:(a) scale up to large number ofmoving objects; and (b) support large number of predictive queries. As a means ofscalability; Panda smartly precomputes parts of the most frequent incoming predictivequeries; which significantly reduces the query response time. Panda employs a tunablethreshold that achieves a trade-off between query response time and the maintenance costof precomptued answers. Experimental results; based on large data sets; show that …,Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2012,28
Locking key ranges with unbundled transaction services,David Lomet; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract To adapt database technology to new environments like cloud platforms or multi-core hardware; or to try anew to provide an extensible database platform; it is useful toseparate transaction services from data management elements that need close physicalproximity to data. With" generic" transactional services of concurrency control and recoveryin a separate transactional component (TC); indexing; cache and disk management; now ina data component (DC); can be simplified and tailored more easily to the platform or to adata type extension with a special purpose index. This decomposition requires that details ofthe DC's management of data be hidden from the TC. Thus; locking and logging need to be"logical"; which poses a number of problems. One problem is the handling of locking forranges of keys. Locks need to be taken at the TC prior to the records and their keys being …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,28
Scalable processing of snapshot and continuous nearest-neighbor queries over one-dimensional uncertain data,Jinchuan Chen; Reynold Cheng; Mohamed Mokbel; Chi-Yin Chow,Abstract In several emerging and important applications; such as location-based services;sensor monitoring and biological databases; the values of the data items are inherentlyimprecise. A useful query class for these data is the Probabilistic Nearest-Neighbor Query(PNN); which yields the IDs of objects for being the closest neighbor of a query point;together with the objects' probability values. Previous studies showed that this query takes along time to evaluate. To address this problem; we propose the Constrained Nearest-Neighbor Query (C-PNN); which returns the IDs of objects whose probabilities are higherthan some threshold; with a given error bound in the answers. We show that the C-PNN canbe answered efficiently with verifiers. These are methods that derive the lower and upperbounds of answer probabilities; so that an object can be quickly decided on whether it …,The VLDB Journal,2009,27
Tinycasper: a privacy-preserving aggregate location monitoring system in wireless sensor networks,Chi-Yin Chow; Mohamed F Mokbel; Tian He,Abstract This demo presents a privacy-preserving aggregate location monitoring system;namely; TinyCasper; in which we can monitor moving objects in wireless sensor networkswhile preserving their location privacy. TinyCasper consists of two main modules; in-networklocation anonymization and aggregate query processing over anonymized locations. In thefirst module; trusted wireless sensor nodes collaborate with each other to anonymize users'exact locations by a cloaked spatial region that satisfies a prespecified privacy requirement.On the other side; the aggregate query processing module collects and analyzes thecloaked spatial regions reported from the wireless sensor nodes to support aggregate andalarm queries over anonymized locations. The prototype of TinyCasper is implemented on aphysical test-bed on the TinyOS/Mote platform with 39 MICAz motes.,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,26
TAREEG: a MapReduce-based web service for extracting spatial data from OpenStreetMap,Louai Alarabi; Ahmed Eldawy; Rami Alghamdi; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract Real spatial data; eg; detailed road networks; rivers; buildings; parks; are not reallyavailable in most of the world. This hinders the practicality of many research ideas that needa real spatial data for testing experiments.

Preference query evaluation over expensive attributes,Justin J Levandoski; Mohamed F Mokbel; Mohamed E Khalefa,Abstract Most database systems allow query processing over attributes that are derived atquery runtime (eg; user-defined functions and remote data calls to web services); makingthem expensive to compute relative to relational data stored in a heap or index. In addition;core support for efficient preference query processing has become an important objective indatabase systems. This paper addresses an important problem at the intersection of thesetwo query processing objectives: efficient preference query evaluation involving expensiveattributes. We explore an efficient framework for processing skyline and multi-objectivequeries in a database when the data involves a mix of" cheap" and" expensive" attributes.Our solution involves a three-phase approach that evaluates a correct final preferenceanswer while aiming to minimizing the number of expensive attributes computations …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,24
Scalable multimedia disk scheduling,Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref; Khaled Elbassioni; Ibrahim Kamel,A new multimedia disk-scheduling algorithm; termed Cascaded-SFC; is presented. TheCascaded-SFC multimedia disk scheduler is applicable in environments where multimediadata requests arrive with different quality of service (QoS) requirements such as real-timedeadline and user priority. Previous work on disk scheduling has focused on optimizing theseek times and/or meeting the real-time deadlines. The Cascaded-SFC disk schedulerprovides a unified framework for multimedia disk scheduling that scales with the number ofscheduling parameters.

Prefjoin: An efficient preference-aware join operator,Mohamed E Khalefa; Mohamed F Mokbel; Justin J Levandoski,Preference queries are essential to a wide spectrum of applications including multi-criteriadecision-making tools and personalized databases. Unfortunately; most of the evaluationtechniques for preference queries assume that the set of preferred attributes are stored inonly one relation; waiving on a wide set of queries that include preference computationsover multiple relations. This paper presents PrefJoin; an efficient preference-aware joinquery operator; designed specifically to deal with preference queries over multiple relations.PrefJoin consists of four main phases: Local Pruning; Data Preparation; Joining; andRefining that filter out; from each input relation; those tuples that are guaranteed not to be inthe final preference set; associate meta data with each non-filtered tuple that will be used tooptimize the execution of the next phases; produce a subset of join result that are relevant …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,22
Spatio-temporal histograms,Hicham G Elmongui; Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref,Abstract This paper presents a framework for building and continuously maintaining spatio-temporal histograms (ST-Histograms; for short). ST-Histograms are used for selectivityestimation of continuous pipelined query operators. Unlike traditional histograms thatexamine and/or sample all incoming data tuples; ST-Histograms are built by monitoring theactual selectivities of the outstanding continuous queries. ST-Histograms have three mainfeatures:(1) The ST-Histograms are built with (almost) no overhead to the system. We useonly feedback (ie; the actual selectivity) from the existing continuous queries.(2) Rather thanwasting system resources in maintaining accurate histograms for the whole spatial space;we only maintain accurate histograms for that part of the space that is relevant to the currentexisting queries. The rest of the space has less accurate histograms.(3) The ST …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2005,22

Continuous query processing in spatio-temporal databases,Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract In this paper; we aim to develop a framework for continuous query processing inspatio-temporal databases. The proposed framework distinguishes itself from other queryprocessors by employing two main paradigms:(1) Scalability in terms of the number ofconcurrent continuous spatio-temporal queries.(2) Incremental evaluation of continuousspatio-temporal queries. Scalability is achieved thorough employing a shared executionparadigm. Incremental evaluation is achieved through computing only the updates to thepreviously reported answer. We distinguish between two types of updates; positive updatesand negative updates. Positive or negative updates indicate that a certain object should beadded to or removed from the previously reported answer; respectively.

Sharek: A scalable dynamic ride sharing system,Bin Cao; Louai Alarabi; Mohamed F Mokbel; Anas Basalamah,Due to its significant economic and environmental impact; sharing the ride among a numberof drivers (ie; Car pooling) has recently gained significant interest from industry andacademia. Hence; a number of ride sharing services have appeared along with variousalgorithms on how to match a rider request to a driver who can provide the ride sharingservice. However; existing techniques have several limitations that affect the quality of theride sharing service; and hence hinder its wide applicability.

An efficient algorithm for shortest path multicast routing under delay and delay variation constraints,Mohamed F Mokbel; Wafaa A Elhaweet; M Nazih Elderini,Abstract A new heuristic algorithm is proposed for constructing multicast tree for multimediaand interactive applications that require certain quality of services; QoS. We consider twomain QoS parameters that are the delay and delay variation. The problem is formulated asconstructing shortest path tree under delay and delay variation constraints. The tree is usedto concurrently transmit packets from source to multiple destinations such that exactly onecopy of any packet traverses the links of the multicast tree. This problem is known to be NP-Complete. The proposed heuristic algorithm solves this problem in polynomial time andgives near optimal tree. We first mention some related work in this area then we formalizethe problem and introduce the new algorithm with the proof of its complexity. Other heuristicalgorithms are examined and compared with the proposed algorithm via simulation.,Proceedings of the Symposium on Performance Evaluation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (SPECTS),2000,14
Transaction support for distributed data,*,A distributed system with transaction support may have a transaction component and one ormore data components. The transaction component may manage a transaction using a logsequence number for each operation; and then transmit operations to one or more datacomponents with log sequence numbers. The data components may perform the dataoperations in an idempotent manner and return a reply. The transaction component maythen write the operation; its log sequence number; and information from the reply messageto its log. The transaction component is able to commit a transaction; as well as retry or undoportions of a transaction; by using the information stored on its log. This may be possibleeven when a single transaction uses multiple data components; which may be located ondifferent devices or manage separate and independent data sources.,*,2014,13
Irregularity in high-dimensional space-filling curves,Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref,Abstract A space-filling curve is a way of mapping the discrete multi-dimensional space intothe one-dimensional space. It acts like a thread that passes through every cell element (orpixel) in the discrete multi-dimensional space so that every cell is visited exactly once. Thus;a space-filling curve imposes a linear order of the cells in the multi-dimensional space.There are numerous kinds of space-filling curves. The difference between such curves is intheir way of mapping to the one-dimensional space. Selecting the appropriate curve for anyapplication requires knowledge of the mapping scheme provided by each space-fillingcurve. Irregularity is proposed as a quantitative measure for the ordering quality imposed byspace-filling curve mapping. The lower the irregularity the better the space-filling curve inpreserving the order of the discrete multi-dimensional space. Five space-filling curves …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2011,13

Flexible and extensible preference evaluation in database systems,Justin J Levandoski; Ahmed Eldawy; Mohamed F Mokbel; Mohamed E Khalefa,Abstract Personalized database systems give users answers tailored to their personalpreferences. While numerous preference evaluation methods for databases have beenproposed (eg; skyline; top-k; k-dominance; k-frequency); the implementation of thesemethods at the core of a database system is a double-edged sword. Core implementationprovides efficient query processing for arbitrary database queries; however; this approach isnot practical since each existing (and future) preference method requires implementationwithin the database engine. To solve this problem; this article introduces FlexPref; aframework for extensible preference evaluation in database systems.

Incremental and general evaluation of reverse nearest neighbors,James M Kang; Mohamed F Mokbel; Shashi Shekhar; Tian Xia; Donghui Zhang,This paper presents a novel algorithm for Incremental and General Evaluation of continuousReverse Nearest neighbor queries (IGERN; for short). The IGERN algorithm is general inthat it is applicable for both continuous monochromatic and bichromatic reverse nearestneighbor queries. This problem is faced in a number of applications such as enhanced 911services and in army strategic planning. A main challenge in these problems is to maintainthe most up-to-date query answers as the data set frequently changes over time. Previousalgorithms for monochromatic continuous reverse nearest neighbor queries rely mainly onmonitoring at the worst case of six pie regions; whereas IGERN takes a radical approach bymonitoring only a single region around the query object.

Permjoin: An efficient algorithm for producing early results in multi-join query plans,Justin J Levandoski; Mohamed E Khalefa; Mohamed F Mokbel,This paper introduces an efficient algorithm for Producing Early Results in Multi-join queryplans (PermJoin; for short). While most previous research focuses only on the case of asingle join operator; PermJoin takes a radical step by addressing query plans with multiplejoin operators. PermJoin is optimized to maximize the early overall throughput and to adaptto fluctuations in data arrival rates. PermJoin is a non-blocking operator that is capable ofproducing join results even if one or more data sources are blocked due to slow or burstynetwork behavior. Furthermore; PermJoin distinguishes itself from all previous techniques asit:(1) employs a new flushing policy to write in-memory data to disk; once memory allotmentis exhausted; in a way that helps increase the probability of producing early resultthroughput in multi-join queries; and (2) employs a novel state manager module that …,Data Engineering; 2008.

Aggregate location monitoring for wireless sensor networks: A histogram-based approach,Chi-Yin Chow; Mohamed F Mokbel; Tian He,Location monitoring systems are used to detect human activities and provide monitoringservices; eg; aggregate queries. In this paper; we consider an aggregate location monitoringsystem where wireless sensor nodes are counting sensors that are only capable of detectingthe number of objects within their sensing areas. As traditional query processors rely on theknowledge of users' exact locations; they cannot provide any monitoring services based onthe readings reported from counting sensors. To this end; we propose an adaptive spatio-temporal histogram to enable monitoring services without the need of users' exact locations.The main idea of the histogram is to keep statistics about the distribution of moving objects.At the core of the histogram; we propose three techniques; memorization; locality awarenessand packing; to improve monitoring accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore; the histogram …,Mobile Data Management: Systems; Services and Middleware; 2009. MDM'09. Tenth International Conference on,2009,11
Chameleon: Context-awareness inside dbmss,Hicham G Elmongui; Walid G Aref; Mohamed F Mokbel,Context is any information used to characterize the situation of an entity. Examples ofcontexts include time; location; identity; and activity of a user. This paper proposes a generalcontext-aware DBMS; named Chameleon; that will eliminate the need for having specializeddatabase engines; eg; spatial DBMS; temporal DBMS; and Hippocratic DBMS; since space;time; and identity can be treated as contexts in the general context-aware DBMS. InChameleon; we can combine multiple contexts into more complex ones using the proposedcontext composition; eg; a Hippocratic DBMS that also provides spatio-temporal andlocation contextual services. As a proof of concept; we construct two case studies using thesame context-aware DBMS platform within Chameleon. One treats identity as a context torealize a privacy-aware (Hippocratic) database server; while the other treats space as a …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09.

Towards efficient search on unstructured data: an intelligent-storage approach,Aravindan Raghuveer; Meera Jindal; Mohamed F Mokbel; Biplob Debnath; David Du,Abstract Applications that create and consume unstructured data have grown both in scaleof storage requirements and complexity of search primitives. We consider two suchapplications: exhaustive search and integration of structured and unstructured data. Currentblock-based storage systems are either incapable or inefficient to address the challengesbought forth by the above applications. We propose a storage framework to efficiently storeand search unstructured and structured data while controlling storage management costs.Experimental results based on our prototype show that the proposed system can provideimpressive performance and feature benefits.,Proceedings of the sixteenth ACM conference on Conference on information and knowledge management,2007,11
Demonstration of Taghreed: A system for querying; analyzing; and visualizing geotagged microblogs,Amr Magdy; Louai Alarabi; Saif Al-Harthi; Mashaal Musleh; Thanaa M Ghanem; Sohaib Ghani; Saleh Basalamah; Mohamed F Mokbel,This paper demonstrates Taghreed; a full-fledged system for efficient and scalable querying;analyzing; and visualizing geotagged microblogs; such as tweets. Taghreed supports a widevariety of queries on all microblogs attributes. In addition; it is able to manage a largenumber (billions) of microblogs for relatively long periods; eg; months. Taghreed consists offour main components:(1) indexer;(2) query engine;(3) recovery manager; and (4) visualizer.Taghreed indexer efficiently digests incoming microblogs with high arrival rates in light main-memory indexes. When the memory becomes full; the memory contents are flushed to diskindexes which are managing billions of microblogs efficiently. On memory failure; therecovery manager restores the memory contents from backup copies. Taghreed queryengine consists of two modules: a query optimizer and a query processor.

Venus: Scalable real-time spatial queries on microblogs with adaptive load shedding,Amr Magdy; Mohamed F Mokbel; Sameh Elnikety; Suman Nath; Yuxiong He,Microblogging services have become among the most popular services on the web in thelast few years. This led to significant increase in data size; speed; and applications. Thispaper presents Venus; a system that supports real-time spatial queries on microblogs.Venus supports its queries on a spatial boundary $ R $ and a temporal boundary $ T $; fromwhich only the top-$ k $ microblogs are returned in the query answer based on a spatio-temporal ranking function. Supporting such queries requires Venus to digest hundreds ofmillions of real-time microblogs in main-memory with high rates; yet; it provides low queryresponses and efficient memory utilization. To this end; Venus employs:(1) an efficient in-memory spatio-temporal index that digests high rates of incoming microblogs in real time;(2)a scalable query processor that prune the search space; $ R $ and $ T $; effectively to …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,9
Deception detection in Twitter,Jalal S Alowibdi; Ugo A Buy; S Yu Philip; Sohaib Ghani; Mohamed Mokbel,Abstract Online Social Networks (OSNs) play a significant role in the daily life of hundreds ofmillions of people. However; many user profiles in OSNs contain deceptive information.Existing studies have shown that lying in OSNs is quite widespread; often for protecting auser's privacy. In this paper; we propose a novel approach for detecting deceptive profiles inOSNs. We specifically define a set of analysis methods for detecting deceptive informationabout user genders and locations in Twitter. First; we collected a large dataset of Twitterprofiles and tweets. Next; we defined methods for gender guessing from Twitter profile colorsand names. Subsequently; we apply Bayesian classification and K-means clusteringalgorithms to Twitter profile characteristics (eg; profile layout colors; first names; user names;and spatiotemporal information) and geolocations to analyze the user behavior.

Exploiting geo-tagged tweets to understand localized language diversity,Amr Magdy; Thanaa M Ghanem; Mashaal Musleh; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract Social media services are the top-growing online communities in the last few years.Among those; Twitter becomes the de facto of microblogging services with millions of tweetsposted everyday. In this paper; we present an analytical study for localized language usageand diversity in Twitter data using a half billion geotagged tweets. We first identify localTwitter communities on a country-level. For the identified communities; we examine (1) thelanguage diversity;(2) the language dominance within the community and how this differsfrom local to global views;(3) demographics representativeness of tweets for real populationdemographics; and (4) the spatial distribution of different cultural groups within the countries.To this end; we group the tweets on two levels. First; we group tweets per country to identifythe local communities. Second; we group tweets within each local community based on …,Proceedings of Workshop on Managing and Mining Enriched Geo-Spatial Data,2014,9
RecStore: an extensible and adaptive framework for online recommender queries inside the database engine,Justin J Levandoski; Mohamed Sarwat; Mohamed F Mokbel; Michael D Ekstrand,Abstract Most recommendation methods (eg; collaborative filtering) consist of (1) acomputationally intense offline phase that computes a recommender model based on users'opinions of items; and (2) an online phase consisting of SQL-based queries that use themodel (generated offline) to derive user preferences and provide recommendations forinteresting items. Current application usage trends require a completely onlinerecommender process; meaning the recommender model must update in real time as newopinions enter the system. To tackle this problem; we propose RecStore; a DBMS storageengine module capable of efficient online model maintenance. Externally; models managedby RecStore behave as relational tables; thus existing SQL-based recommendation queriesremain unchanged while gaining online model support. RecStore maintains internal …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2012,9
Pantheon: Exascale file system search for scientific computing,Joseph L Naps; Mohamed F Mokbel; David HC Du,Abstract Modern scientific computing generates petabytes of data in billions of files that mustbe managed. These files are often organized; by name; in a hierarchical directory treecommon to most file systems. As the scale of data has increased; this has proven to be apoor method of file organization. Recent tools have allowed for users to navigate files basedon file metadata attributes to provide more meaningful organization. In order to search thismetadata; it is often stored on separate metadata servers. This solution has drawbacksthough due to the multi-tiered architecture of many large scale storage solutions. As data ismoved between various tiers of storage and/or modified; the overhead incurred formaintaining consistency between these tiers and the metadata server becomes very large.As scientific systems continue to push towards exascale; this problem will become more …,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2011,9
On main-memory flushing in microblogs data management systems,Amr Magdy; Rami Alghamdi; Mohamed F Mokbel,Searching microblogs; eg; tweets and comments; is practically supported through main-memory indexing for scalable data digestion and efficient query evaluation. With continuityand excessive numbers of microblogs; it is infeasible to keep data in main-memory for longperiods. Thus; once allocated memory budget is filled; a portion of data is flushed frommemory to disk to continuously accommodate newly incoming data. Existing techniquescome with either low memory hit ratio due to flushing items regardless of their relevance toincoming queries or significant overhead of tracking individual data items; which limitscalability of microblogs systems in either cases. In this paper; we propose kFlushing policythat exploits popularity of top-k queries in microblogs to smartly select a subset of microblogsto flush. kFlushing is mainly designed to increase memory hit ratio. To this end; it …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,8
RecBench: benchmarks for evaluating performance of recommender system architectures,Justin J Levandoski; Michael D Ekstrand; Michael J Ludwig; Ahmed Eldawy; Mohamed F Mokbel; John T Riedl,Abstract Traditionally; recommender systems have been" hand-built"; implemented ascustom applications hard-wired to a particular recommendation task. Recently; the databasecommunity has begun exploring alternative DBMS-based recommender systemarchitectures; whereby a database both stores the recommender system data (eg; ratingsdata and the derived recommender models) and generates recommendations using SQLqueries. In this paper; we present a comprehensive experimental comparison of botharchitectures. We define a set of benchmark tasks based on the needs of a typicalrecommender-powered e-commerce site. We then evaluate the performance of the" hand-built" MultiLens recommender application against two DBMS-based implementations: anunmodified DBMS and RecStore; a DBMS modified to improve efficiency in incremental …,*,2011,8
Deferred updates for flash-based storage,Biplob Debnath; Mohamed F Mokbel; David J Lilja; David Du,The NAND flash memory based storage has faster read; higher power savings; and lowercooling cost compared to the conventional rotating magnetic disk drive. However; in case offlash memory; read and write operations are not symmetric. Write operations are muchslower than read operations. Moreover; frequent update operations reduce the lifetime of theflash memory. Due to the faster read performance; flash-based storage is particularlyattractive for the read-intensive database workloads; while it can produce poor performancewhen used for the update-intensive database workloads. This paper aims to improve writeperformance and lifetime of flash-based storage for the update-intensive workloads. Inparticular; we propose a new hierarchical approach named as deferred updatemethodology. Instead of directly updating the data records; first we buffer the changes …,Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST); 2010 IEEE 26th Symposium on,2010,8
Phenomenon-aware stream query processing,Mohamed H Ali; Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref,Spatio-temporal data streams that are generated from mobile stream sources (eg; mobilesensors) experience similar environmental conditions that result in distinct phenomena.Several research efforts are dedicated to detect and track various phenomena inside a datastream management system (DSMS). In this paper; we use the detected phenomena toreduce the demand on the DSMS resources. The main idea is to let the query processorobserve the input data streams at the phenomena level. Then; each incoming continuousquery is directed only to those phenomena that participate in the query answer. Two levelsof indexing are employed; a phenomenon index and a query index. The phenomenon indexprovides a fine resolution view of the input streams that participate in a particularphenomenon. The query index utilizes the phenomenon index to maintain a query …,Mobile Data Management; 2007 International Conference on,2007,8

GeoRank: an efficient location-aware news feed ranking system,Jie Bao; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract News feed function becomes very popular in many social networking services andnews aggregators; as it delivers the messages from users' subscribed sources. Morerecently; location has been introduced to the news feed function; which returns the newsitems relevant to the user's location. However; with the large number of the news itemsgenerated by the sources; existing news feed systems opt to return the top-k most recentones; which completely overlooks the messages' spatial relevance and may end up inmissing more geographically close ones. In this paper; we present GeoRank; an efficientlocation-aware news feed ranking system that provides top-k new feeds based on (a) spatialproximity;(b) temporal proximity; and (c) user preferences. GeoRank encapsulates spatio-temporal pruning techniques to improve its response time and efficiency.

Evaluation of range nearest-neighbor queries with quality guarantee,Chi-Yin Chow; Mohamed F Mokbel; Joe Naps; Suman Nath,Abstract. The range nearest-neighbor (NN) query is an important query type in location-based services; as it can be applied to the case that an NN query has a spatial region;instead of a location point; as the query location. Examples of the applications of range NNqueries include uncertain locations and privacy-preserving queries. Given a set of objects;the range NN answer is a set of objects that includes the nearest object (s) to every point in agiven spatial region. The answer set size would signicantly increase as the spatial regiongets larger. Unfortunately; mobile users in wireless environments suer from scarcebandwidth and low-quality communication; transmitting a large answer set from a databaseserver to the user would pose very high response time. To this end; we propose anapproximate range NN query process-ing algorithm to balance a performance tradeo …,In Proceedings of the International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2009,7
Location-aware query processing and optimization,Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref,The wide spread use of cellular phones; handheld devices; and GPS-like technologyenables location-aware environments where virtually all objects are aware of their locations.Such environments call for new query processing techniques that deal with the continuousmovement of both spatio-temporal objects and queries.

Spectral LPM: an optimal locality-preserving mapping using the spectral (not fractal) order,Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref; Ananth Grama,For the past two decades; fractals (eg; the Hilbert and Peano space-filling curves) have beenconsidered the natural method for providing a locality-preserving mapping. The idea behinda locality-preserving mapping is to map points that are nearby in the multidimensional spaceinto points that are nearby in the one-dimensional space. We argue against the use offractals in locality-preserving mapping algorithms; and present examples with experimentalevidence to show why fractals produce poor locality-preserving mappings. In addition; wepropose an optimal locality-preserving mapping algorithm; termed the spectral locality-preserving mapping algorithm (Spectral LPM; for short); that makes use of the spectrum ofthe multidimensional space. We give a mathematical proof for the optimality of Spectral LPM;and also demonstrate its practical use.,Data Engineering; 2003. Proceedings. 19th International Conference on,2003,7
Sphinx: Distributed execution of interactive sql queries on big spatial data,Ahmed Eldawy; Mostafa Elganainy; Ammar Bakeer; Ahmed Abdelmotaleb; Mohamed Mokbel,Abstract This paper presents Sphinx; a full-fledged distributed system which uses a standardSQL interface to process big spatial data. Sphinx adds spatial data types; indexes and queryprocessing; inside the code-base of Cloudera Impala for efficient processing of spatial data.In particular; Sphinx is composed of four main components; namely; query parser; indexer;query planner; and query executor. The query parser injects spatial data types and functionsin the SQL interface of Sphinx. The indexer creates spatial indexes in Sphinx by adopting atwo-layered index design. The query planner utilizes these indexes to construct efficientquery plans for range query and spatial join operations. Finally; the query executor carriesout these plans on big spatial datasets in a distributed cluster.

New Algorithms for multicast routing in real time Networks,Mohamed F Mokbel; Mohamed Fathalla; Mohamed N El-derini; A Wafaa,Abstract Handling group communication is a key requirement for numerous applications thathave one source sends the same information concurrently to multiple destinations. Finding aroute from a source to a group of destinations is referred as multicast routing. The objectiveof multicast routing is to find a tree that either has a minimum total cost; which called theSteiner tree or has a minimum cost for every path from source to each destination; which iscalled shortest path tree. With the rapid evolution of real time and multimedia applicationslike audio/video conferencing; interactive distributed games and real time remote controlsystem; certain quality of services; QoS; need to be guaranteed in underlying network.Multicast routing algorithms should support the required QoS. In this thesis we consider twoimportant QoS parameters that need to be guaranteed in order to support the real time …,*,1999,6

A demonstration of Shahed: A MapReduce-based system for querying and visualizing satellite data,Ahmed Eldawy; Saif Alharthi; Abdulhadi Alzaidy; Anas Daghistani; Sohaib Ghani; Saleh Basalamah; Mohamed F Mokbel,Several space agencies such as NASA are continuously collecting datasets of earthdynamics-eg; temperature; vegetation; and cloud coverage-through satellites. This data isstored in a publicly available archive for scientists and researchers and is very useful forstudying climate; desertification; and land use change. The benefit of this data comes fromits richness as it provides an archived history for over 15 years of satellite observations.Unfortunately; the use of such data is very limited due to the huge size of archives (> 500TB)and the limited capabilities of traditional applications.

Context awareness in mobile systems,Mohamed Sarwat; Jie Bao; Chi-Yin Chow; Justin Levandoski; Amr Magdy; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract Context represents any information that can be used to characterize the situation ofan entity. An entity is a person; place; or object that is considered relevant to the interactionbetween a user and an application; including the user and application themselves. Theubiquity of mobile devices (eg; smartphones; GPS devices) has in part motivated the use ofcontextual information in modern mobile applications. From one perspective; context inmobile systems can fall into three categories:(a) user context that includes the personalattributes of the user; eg; spatial location and budget;(b) point-of-interest (POI) context; eg;restaurant location; operating time; and rating; and (c) environmental context; eg; weatherand road conditions.

Effective privacy-preserving online route planning,Carmen Ruiz Vicente; Ira Assent; Christian S Jensen,An online Route Planning Service (RPS) computes a route from one location to another.Current RPSs such as Google Maps require the use of precise locations. However; someusers may not want to disclose their source and destination locations due to privacyconcerns. An approach that supplies fake locations to an existing service incurs asubstantial loss of quality of service; and the service may well return a result that may be nothelpful to the user. We propose a solution that is able to return accurate route planningresults when source and destination regions are used in order to achieve privacy. Thesolution re-uses a standard online RPS rather than replicate this functionality; and it needsno trusted third party. The solution is able to compute the exact results without leaking of theexact locations to the RPS or un-trusted parties. In addition; we provide heuristics that …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2011 12th IEEE International Conference on,2011,5

Towards a GPU accelerated spatial computing framework,Harshada Chavan; Rami Alghamdi; Mohamed F Mokbel,Ease of availability of spatial data has increased the interest in the domain of spatialcomputing. Various services such as Uber; Google maps; and Blue Brain Project have beendeveloped that consume and process such spatial data. Spatial data processing is not onlydata intensive but also compute intensive. A lot of efforts have been made by the spatialcomputing community to tackle the problems due to huge volumes of data. However;unfortunately; not enough attention has been given to address the compute intensive natureof the problem. In parallel to the advancements in spatial domain; Graphics Processing Units(GPUs) have emerged as compelling computing units. A lot of work has been done in spatialdomain to leverage the computing power of GPUs. However; to the best of our knowledge;none of the work present a holistic system.

A framework for spatial predictive query processing and visualization,Abdeltawab M Hendawi; Mohamed Ali; Mohamed F Mokbel,This demo presents the Panda system for efficient support of a wide variety of predictivespatio-temporal queries. These queries are widely used in several applications includingtraffic management; location-based advertising; and store finders. Panda targets long-termquery prediction as it relies on adapting a long-term prediction function to:(a) scale up tolarge number of moving objects; and (b) support predictive queries. Panda does not onlyaim to predict the query answer; but; it also aims to predict the incoming queries such thatparts of the query answer can be precomputed before the query arrival. Panda maintains atunable threshold that achieves a trade-off between the predictive query response time andthe system overhead in precomputing the query answer.

A comparative study of linear and region based diagrams,Björn Gottfried,Abstract There are two categories of objects spatial information science investigates: actualobjects and their spatial properties; such as in geography; and abstract objects which areemployed metaphorically; as for visual languages. A prominent example of the latter arediagrams that model knowledge of some domain. Different aspects of diagrams are ofinterest; including their formal properties or how human users work with them; for example;with diagrams representing sets. The literature about diagrammatic systems for therepresentation of sets shows a dominance of region-based diagrams like Euler circles andVenn diagrams. The effectiveness of these diagrams; however; is limited because region-based diagrams become quite complex for more then three sets. By contrast; lineardiagrams are not equally prevalent but enable the representation of a greater number of …,Journal of Spatial Information Science,2015,4
On producing high and early result throughput in multijoin query plans,Justin K Levandoski; Mohamed E Khalefa; Mohamed F Mokbel,This paper introduces an efficient framework for producing high and early result throughputin multijoin query plans. While most previous research focuses on optimizing for casesinvolving a single join operator; this work takes a radical step by addressing query planswith multiple join operators. The proposed framework consists of two main methods; a flushalgorithm and operator state manager. The framework assumes a symmetric hash join; acommon method for producing early results; when processing incoming data. In this way;our methods can be applied to a group of previous join operators (optimized for single-joinqueries) when taking part in multijoin query plans. Specifically; our framework can beapplied by 1) employing a new flushing policy to write in-memory data to disk; once memoryallotment is exhausted; in a way that helps increase the probability of producing early …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,4

Spatial cloaking for anonymous location-based services in mobile peer-to-peer environments,Chi-Yin Chow; Mohamed F Mokbel; Xuan Liu,Abstract This paper tackles a privacy breach in current location-based services (LBS) wheremobile users have to report their exact location information to an LBS provider in order toobtain their desired services. For example; a user who wants to issue a query asking abouther nearest gas station has to report her exact location to an LBS provider. However; manyrecent research efforts have indicated that revealing private location information topotentially untrusted LBS providers may lead to major privacy breaches. To preserve userlocation privacy; spatial cloaking is the most commonly used privacy-enhancing technique inLBS. The basic idea of the spatial cloaking technique is to blur a user's exact location into acloaked area that satisfies the user specified privacy requirements. Unfortunately; existingspatial cloaking algorithms designed for LBS rely on fixed communication infrastructure …,GeoInformatica. doi,2010,4
Exploiting the Impact of Database System Configuration Parameters: A Design of Experiments Approach.,Biplob K Debnath; Mohamed F Mokbel; David J Lilja,Abstract Tuning database system configuration parameters to proper values according to theexpected query workload plays a very important role in determining DBMS performance.However; the number of configuration parameters in a DBMS is very large. Furthermore;typical query workloads have a large number of constituent queries; which makes tuningvery time and effort intensive. To reduce tuning time and effort; database administrators relyon their experience and some rules of thumb to select a set of important configurationparameters for tuning. Nonetheless; as a statistically rigorous methodology is not used; timeand effort may be wasted by tuning those parameters which may have no or marginal effectson the DBMS performance for the given query workload. Database administrators also usecompressed query workloads to reduce tuning time. If not carefully selected; the …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2008,4

A demonstration of SHAREK: an efficient matching framework for ride sharing systems,Louai Alarabi; Bin Cao; Liwei Zhao; Mohamed F Mokbel; Anas Basalamah,Abstract Recently; many ride sharing systems have been commercially introduced (eg; Uber;Flinc; and Lyft) forming a multi-billion dollars industry. The main idea is to match peoplerequesting a certain ride to other people who are acting as drivers on their own spare time.The matching algorithm run by these services is very simple and ignores a wide sector ofusers who can be exploited to maximize the benefits of these services. In this demo; wedemonstrate SHAREK; a driver-rider matching algorithm that can be embedded insideexisting ride sharing services to enhance the quality of their matching. SHAREK has thepotential to boost the performance and widen the user base and applicability of existing ridesharing services. This is mainly because within its matching technique; SHAREK takes intoaccount user preferences in terms of maximum waiting time the rider is willing to have …,Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2016,3
Understanding language diversity in local Twitter communities,Amr Magdy; Thanaa M Ghanem; Mashaal Musleh; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract Twitter is one of the top-growing online communities in the last years. In this poster;we study the language usage and diversity in Twitter local communities. We identify localcommunities in Twitter on a country-level. For each community; we examine:(1) thelanguage diversity;(2) the language dominance and how it differs from local to globalviews;(3) demographic representativeness of tweets; and (4) the spatial distribution ofdifferent cultural groups within the community. We show fruitful insights about languageusage on Twitter which can be exploited in language-based applications on top of tweets;eg; lingual analysis and disaster management. In addition; we provide an interactive tool toexplore the spatial distribution of cultural groups; which provides a low-effort and high-precision localization of different cultural groups.,Proceedings of the 27th ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media,2016,3
GARNET: A holistic system approach for trending queries in microblogs,Christopher Jonathan; Amr Magdy; Mohamed F Mokbel; Albert Jonathan,The recent wide popularity of microblogs (eg; tweets; online comments) has empoweredvarious important applications; including; news delivery; event detection; market analysis;and target advertising. A core module in all these applications is a frequent/trending queryprocessor that aims to find out those topics that are highly frequent or trending in the socialmedia through posted microblogs. Unfortunately current attempts for such core modulesuffer from several drawbacks. Most importantly; their narrow scope; as they focus only onsolving trending queries for a very special case of localized and very recent microblogs. Thispaper presents GARNET; a holistic system equipped with one-stop efficient and scalablesolution for supporting a generic form of context-aware frequent and trending queries onmicroblogs.

Towards context and preference-aware location-based database systems,Mohamed F Mokbel; Justin J Levandoski,Abstract The explosive growth of location-detection devices; wireless communications; andmobile databases has resulted in the realization of location-based services as commercialproducts and research prototypes. Unfortunately; current locationbased applications (eg;store finders) are rigid as they are completely isolated from various concepts of user“preferences” and/or “context”. Such rigidness results in nonsuitable services (eg; avegetarian user may get a restaurant with non-vegetarian menu). In this paper; we introducethe system architecture of a Context and Preference-Aware Location-based DatabaseServer (CareDB; for short); currently under development at University of Minnesota; thatdelivers personalized services to its customers based on the surrounding context.

Space-filling curves,Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}.

Scrap: A statistical approach for creating a database query workload based on performance bottlenecks,James Skarie; Biplob K Debnath; David J Lilja; Mohamed F Mokbel,With the tremendous growth in stored data; the role of database systems has become moresignificant than ever before. Standard query workloads; such as the TPC-C and TPC-Hbenchmark suites; are used to evaluate and tune the functionality and performance ofdatabase systems. Running and configuring benchmarks is a time consuming task. Itrequires substantial statistical expertise due to the enormous data size and large number ofqueries in the workload. Subsetting can be used to reduce the number of queries in aworkload. An existing workload subsetting technique selected queries based on similaritiesof the ranks of the queries for low-level characteristics; such as cache miss rates; or basedon the execution time required in different computer systems. However; many low-levelcharacteristics are correlated; produce similar behaviors. Also; raw execution time as a …,Workload Characterization; 2007. IISWC 2007.

On query processing and optimality using spectral locality-preserving mappings,Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref,Abstract A locality-preserving mapping (LPM) from the multi-dimensional space into the one-dimensional space is beneficial for many applications (eg; range queries; nearest-neighborqueries; clustering; and declustering) when multi-dimensional data is placed into one-dimensional storage (eg; the disk). The idea behind a locality-preserving mapping is to mappoints that are nearby in the multi-dimensional space into points that are nearby in the one-dimensional space. For the past two decades; fractals (eg; the Hilbert and Peano space-filling curves) have been considered the natural method for providing a locality-preservingmapping to support efficient answer for range queries and similarity search queries. In thispaper; we go beyond the idea of fractals. Instead; we investigate a locality-preservingmapping algorithm (The Spectral LPM) that uses the spectrum of the multi-dimensional …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2003,3
Spatial coding-based approach for partitioning big spatial data in Hadoop,Xiaochuang Yao; Mohamed F Mokbel; Louai Alarabi; Ahmed Eldawy; Jianyu Yang; Wenju Yun; Lin Li; Sijing Ye; Dehai Zhu,Abstract Spatial data partitioning (SDP) plays a powerful role in distributed storage andparallel computing for spatial data. However; due to skew distribution of spatial data andvarying volume of spatial vector objects; it leads to a significant challenge to ensure bothoptimal performance of spatial operation and data balance in the cluster. To tackle thisproblem; we proposed a spatial coding-based approach for partitioning big spatial data inHadoop. This approach; firstly; compressed the whole big spatial data based on spatialcoding matrix to create a sensing information set (SIS); including spatial code; size; countand other information. SIS was then employed to build spatial partitioning matrix; which wasused to spilt all spatial objects into different partitions in the cluster finally. Based on ourapproach; the neighbouring spatial objects can be partitioned into the same block. At the …,Computers & Geosciences,2017,2
Demonstration of kite: A scalable system for microblogs data management,Amr Magdy; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract Motivated by its wide availability and richness; there have been a plethora of recentwork in querying; analyzing; and visualizing microblogs (see [3] for a brief survey). Examplesof microblogs include tweets; online reviews; and comments on news websites.Unfortunately; existing work in microblog lacks data management tools that provide thenecessary infrastructure to support efficient storage; indexing; and retrieval of microblogs.Hence; researchers; developers; and practitioners who need to process microblogs for theirown purposes would need to either build their own ad-hoc techniques [5] or use any ofexisting general purpose big data engines; eg; Spark; as their backbone [4]. Relying on ad-hoc techniques does not scale for large data sizes. Meanwhile; existing general purpose bigdata engines are built in a generic way to support various query workloads.

Spatiotemporal Database,Xiaopeng Xiong; Mohamed F Mokbel; Walid G Aref,Spatial network databases render support for spatial networks by providing the necessarydata model; query language; storage structure; and indexing methods. Spatial networks canbe modeled as graphs where nodes are points embedded in space. One distinguishingcharacteristic of a spatial network is the primary focus on the role of connectivity inrelationships rather than the spatial proximity between objects. Spatial network databasesare the kernel of many important applications; including transportation planning; air trafficcontrol; water; electric; and gas utilities; telephone networks; urban management; utilitynetwork maintenance; and irrigation canal management. The underlying data of interest forthese applications are structured as a spatial graph; which consists of a finite collection ofthe points (ie; nodes); the line segments (ie; edges) connecting the points; the location of …,*,2017,2

Location data management: A tale of two systems and the" next destination"!,Mohamed Mokbel; Chi Yin Chow; Walid Aref,Abstract In early 2000; we had the vision of ubiquitous location services; where each objectis aware of its location; and continuously sends its location to a designated database server.This flood of location data opened the door for a myriad of location-based services that wereconsidered visionary at that time; yet today they are a reality and have become ubiquitous.To realize our early vision; we identified two main challenges that needed to be addressed;namely; scalability and privacy. We have addressed these challenges through two mainsystems; PLACE and Casper. PLACE; developed at Purdue University from 2000 to 2005;set up the environment for built-in database support of scalable and continuous location-based services.

Recdb: Towards dbms support for online recommender systems,Mohamed Sarwat,Abstract Recommender systems have become popular in both commercial and academicsettings. The main purpose of recommender systems is to suggest to users useful andinteresting items or content (data) from a considerably large set of items. Traditionalrecommender systems do not take into account system issues (ie; scalability and queryefficiency).

Learning from Data Streams,João Gama; Pedro Pereira Rodrigues,Abstract In the last two decades; machine learning research and practice has focused onbatch learning usually with small datasets. In batch learning; the whole training data isavailable to the algorithm that outputs a decision model after processing the data eventually(or most of the times) multiple times. The rationale behind this practice is that examples aregenerated at random accordingly to some stationary probability distribution. Also; mostlearners use a greedy; hill-climbing search in the space of models. What distinguishescurrent data sets from earlier ones are the continuous flow of data and the automatic datafeeds. We do not just have people who are entering information into a computer. Instead; wehave computers entering data into each other. Nowadays there are applications in which thedata is modelled best not as persistent tables but rather as transient data streams. In …,*,2009,2

In theseapplications; data evolve over time in an unpredictable and bursty arrival fashion;representing streams of sensor-measured values; locations of moving objects; networktraffic; sales transactions or phone call records. In contrast to conventional datamanagement applications; a major requirement of streaming applications is to continuouslymonitor and possibly react to new; interesting events at the input streams.

On the analysis of high-dimensional space-filling curves,Walid G Aref; MF Mokbel; I Kamel,Abstract Space-filling curves map the multi-dimensional space into the one-dimensionalspace. A space-filling curve acts like a thread that passes through every cell element (orpixel) in the n-dimensional space so that every cell is visited only once; ie; the space-fillingcurve does not self-intersect. Thus; a space-filling curve imposes a linear order of the cells inthe n-dimensional space. This is useful in sorting and/or scheduling of objects that lie in themulti-dimensional space.,*,2001,2

Geo-tagging non-spatial concepts,Amgad Madkour; Walid G Aref; Mohamed Mokbel; Saleh Basalamah,Abstract Concept Geo-tagging is the process of assigning a textual identifier that describes areal-world entity to a physical geographic location. A concept can either be a spatial conceptwhere it possesses a spatial presence or be a non-spatial concept where it has no explicitspatial presence. Geo-tagging locations with non-spatial concepts that have no directrelation is a very useful and important operation but is also very challenging. The reason isthat; being a non-spatial concept; eg; crime; makes it hard to geo-tag it. This paper proposesusing the semantic information associated with concepts and locations such as the type as amean for identifying these relations. The co-occurrence of spatial and non-spatial conceptswithin the same textual resources; eg; in the web; can be an indicator of a relationshipbetween these spatial and non-spatial concepts.

The anatomy of sindbad: A location-aware social networking system,Mohamed Sarwat; Jie Bao; Ahmed Eldawy; Justin J Levandoski; Amr Magdy; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract This paper features Sindbad; a location-based social networking system. Sindbadsupports three new services beyond traditional social networking services; namely; location-aware news feed; location-aware recommender; and location-aware ranking. These newservices not only consider social relevance for its users; but they also consider spatialrelevance. Since location-aware social networking systems have to deal with large numberof users; large number of messages; and user mobility; efficiency and scalability areimportant issues. To this end; Sindbad encapsulates its three main services inside the queryprocessing engine of PostgreSQL. Usage and internal functionality of Sindbad areimplemented with PostgreSQL and Google Maps API.

On Spatial Joins in MapReduce,Ibrahim Sabek; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract This paper provides the first attempt for a full-fledged query optimizer forMapReduce-based spatial join algorithms. The optimizer develops its own taxonomy thatcovers almost all possible ways of doing a spatial join for any two input datasets. Theoptimizer comes in two flavors; cost-based and rule-based. Given two input data sets; thecost-based query optimizer evaluates the costs of all possible options in the developedtaxonomy; and selects the one with the lowest cost. The rule-based query optimizerabstracts the developed cost models of the cost-based optimizer into a set of simple easy-to-check heuristic rules. Then; it applies its rules to select the lowest cost option. Both queryoptimizers are deployed and experimentally evaluated inside a widely used open-sourceMapReduce-based big spatial data system. Exhaustive experiments show that both query …,Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2017,*

An Abstract Semantically Rich Compiler Collocative and Interpretative Model for OpenMP Programs,Mohammed F Mokbel; Robert D Kent; Michael Wong,Abstract To understand the behavior of OpenMP programs; special tools and adaptivetechniques are needed for performance analysis. However; these tools provide low-levelprofile information at the assembly and functions boundaries via instrumentation at thebinary or code level; which are very hard to interpret. Moreover; to compare differentOpenMP-enabled compilers; there is no systematic methodology that provides an easycomparison. Hence; in this paper; we propose a new model for OpenMP-enabled compilersthat assesses the performance differences in well-defined formulations by dividing OpenMPprogram conditions into four distinct states which account for all the possible cases that anOpenMP program can take. The model works as a first-level inspector to reason about theeffect of compiler performance on every state in an unobtrusive and informative way. In …,The Computer Journal,2011,*

Privacy of Location Trajectory,Chi-Yin Chow; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract The ubiquity of mobile devices with global positioning functionality (eg; GPS andAssisted GPS) and Internet connectivity (eg; 3G and Wi-Fi) has resulted in widespreaddevelopment of location-based services (LBS). Typical examples of LBS include localbusiness search; e-marketing; social networking; and automotive traffic monitoring. AlthoughLBS provide valuable services for mobile users; revealing their private locations topotentially untrusted LBS service providers pose privacy concerns. In general; there are twotypes of LBS; namely; snapshot and continuous LBS. For snapshot LBS; a mobile user onlyneeds to report its current location to a service provider once to get its desired information.On the other hand; a mobile user has to report its location to a service provider in a periodicor on-demand manner to obtain its desired continuous LBS.

I/O cache,DONGHUI ZHANG; VASSILIS J TSOTRAS,An example of index oriented towards human navigation is the web directory. In such anindex; links to sites are organized into hierarchical categories; according to the sites'contents. In web directories; normally the tasks of collecting and categorizing pages arecarried out under supervision of human editors. An example of index not oriented to humansis a hidden list of metadata. Metadata are data about data. As a mean of assisting a searchengine to locate content or an information entity; they can be used to describe that content orentity. While not visible to humans; this information can provide contextual clues to automaticalgorithms used by search engines.,*,2009,*

Journal of Location Based Services,Mohamed Mokbel; Silvia Nittel,The combined functionality of location-aware devices; wireless networks; and mobilecomputing is enabling a new era of location-based mobile services. Examples of suchservices include location-aware emergency services; navigation and wayfinding; location-based marketing; and location-based gaming. While locationbased services promiseincreased safety and convenience; inappropriate use of an individual's presents threats topersonal privacy and security. Recent social studies show that as people become moreprivacy-aware as they tend to avoid using location-based services in order to maintain theirlocation privacy. As a result; there is a real concern that the privacy issues are becoming abarrier to more widespread development and use of location-based services.

The International Workshop on Privacy-Aware Location-based Mobile Services (PALMS 2007),Mohamed F Mokbel; Matt Duckham; Silvia Nittel,Combining the functionality of location-aware devices; wireless and cellular phonetechnologies; and data management results in enabling a new era of location-based mobileservices that aim to provide personalized services to their customers based on their currentlocations. Examples of such services include location-aware emergency service; location-based advertisement; live traffic reports; and location-based store finder. Although location-based services promise safety and convenience; they threaten the privacy and security fortheir customers as they rely mainly on the knowledge of their customers' locationinformation. The current model of location-based services trades the customers' privacy withthe service. If a user wants to keep her private location information; she has to turn off herlocation-aware device and temporarily unsubscribe from the service.

FACULTY OF ENGINEERING,Mohamed Fathalla Hassan Mokbel,ABSTRACT Handling group communication is a key requirement for numerous applicationsthat have one source sends the same information concurrently to multiple destinations.Finding a route from a source to a group of destinations is referred as multicast routing. Theobjective of multicast routing is to find a tree that either has a minimum total cost; whichcalled the Steiner tree or has a minimum cost for every path from source to each destination;which is called shortest path tree. With the rapid evolution of real time and multimediaapplications like audio/video conferencing; interactive distributed games and real timeremote control system; certain quality of services; QoS; need to be guaranteed in underlyingnetwork. Multicast routing algorithms should support the required QoS. In this thesis weconsider two important QoS parameters that need to be guaranteed in order to support …,*,1999,*

Furthermore;typical query workloads have a large number of constituent queries; which makes tuningvery time and effort intensive. To reduce tuning time and effort; database administrators relyon their experience and some rules of thumb to select a set of important configurationparameters for tuning. Nonetheless; as a statistically rigorous methodology is not used; timeand effort may be wasted by tuning those parameters which may have no or marginal effectson the DBMS performance for the given query workload. Database administrators also usecompressed query workloads to reduce tuning time. If not carefully selected; the …,*,*,*
