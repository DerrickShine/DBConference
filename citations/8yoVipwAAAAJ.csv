Nanowire-based one-dimensional electronics,Claes Thelander; Prabhat Agarwal; S Brongersma; Joël Eymery; Lou-Fé Feiner; Alfred Forchel; M Scheffler; W Riess; BJ Ohlsson; U Gösele; Lars Samuelson,During the last half century; a dramatic downscaling of electronics has taken place; aminiaturization that the industry expects to continue for at least a decade. We present effortsto use the self-assembly of one-dimensional semiconductor nanowires 1 in order to bringnew; high-performance nanowire devices as an add-on to mainstream Si technology. Thenanowire approach offers a coaxial gate-dielectric-channel geometry that is ideal for furtherdownscaling and electrostatic control; as well as heterostructure-based devices on Siwafers.,Materials today,2006,676
Self-assembled growth of catalyst-free GaN wires by metal–organic vapour phase epitaxy,Robert Köster; Jun-Seok Hwang; C Durand; D Le Si Dang; J Eymery,Abstract A catalyst-free method for growing self-assembled GaN wires on c-plane sapphiresubstrates by metal–organic vapour phase epitaxy is developed. This approach; based on insitu deposition of a thin SiN x layer (~ 2 nm); enables epitaxial growth of c-oriented wireswith 200–1500 nm diameters and a large length/diameter ratio (> 100) on c-plane sapphiresubstrate. Detailed study of the growth mechanisms shows that a combination of keyparameters is necessary to obtain vertical growth. In particular; the duration of the SiN xdeposition prior to the wire growth is critical for controlling the epitaxy with the substrate. TheGaN seed nucleation time determines the mean size diameter and structural quality; and ahigh Si-dopant concentration promotes vertical growth. Such GaN wires exhibit UV-lightemission centred at~ 350 nm and a weak yellow band (~ 550 nm) at low temperature.,Nanotechnology,2009,159

The structural properties of single wires are studied in detail by scanningtransmission electron microscopy and in a more original way by secondary ion massspectroscopy to quantify defects; thickness (1–8 nm) and In-composition in the wells (∼16%). The core–shell MQW light emission characteristics (390–420 nm at 5 K) wereinvestigated by cathodo-and photoluminescence demonstrating the absence of the quantumStark effect as expected due to the nonpolar orientation. Finally; these radial nonpolarquantum wells were used in room-temperature single-wire electroluminescent devicesemitting at 392 nm by exploiting sidewall emission.,Nano letters,2011,157
Homoepitaxial growth of catalyst-free GaN wires on N-polar substrates,Xiao Jun Chen; Guillaume Perillat-Merceroz; Diane Sam-Giao; Christophe Durand; Joël Eymery,The shape of c-oriented GaN nanostructures is found to be directly related to the crystalpolarity. As evidenced by convergent beam electron diffraction applied to GaNnanostructures grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy on c-sapphire substrates: wiresgrown on nitridated sapphire have the N-polarity ([000 1¯]) whereas pyramidal crystals haveGa-polarity ([0001]). In the case of homoepitaxy; the GaN wires can be directly selectedusing N-polar GaN freestanding substrates and exhibit good optical properties.

It is applied tothe solid-phase dewetting of a finite film with an initial rectangular profile and considers thesurface diffusion mechanism. For an isotropic surface energy; the film aspect ratio and theadhesion energy between the film and the substrate are shown to be the main parametersthat quantify the retraction; the breaking time; and the number of agglomerates. Moreover; itis found that mild surface energy anisotropy with an energy minimum in the horizontal planepostpones the mass detachment.

Enhanced Sb incorporation in InAsSb nanowires grown by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy,B Mattias Borg; Kimberly A Dick; Joël Eymery; Lars-Erik Wernersson,We demonstrate metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy of InAs 1− x Sb x nanowires (x= 0.08–0.77) for applications in high-speed electronics and long-wavelength optical devices. Thecomposition of the InAsSb nanowires and InAsSb epilayers on the same sample isindependently determined using lab-setup high resolution x-ray diffraction; by making use ofthe size-dependent in-plane broadening of the nanowire Bragg peak. We find that theincorporation of Sb into the nanowires is significantly higher than for planar epitaxy underthe same growth conditions. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that this is due to adramatically decreased effective V/III ratio at the particle/nanowire interface.,Applied Physics Letters,2011,40
Ultra thin silicon films directly bonded onto silicon wafers,F Fournel; H Moriceau; N Magnea; J Eymery; JL Rouvière; K Rousseau; B Aspar,Abstract Ultra thin film of silicon bonded on 4 in.(001) silicon wafers have been obtained bycombining a direct hydrophobic silicon bonded technique with a layer transfer. The twistangle between the ultra thin Si film and the Si substrate was varied from 0 to 15°. X-rayreflectivity measured the thickness and the roughness of the ultra thin films. Complementaryresults concerning the interface structure were obtained with high resolution transmissionelectronic microscopy. It is shown that an ultra thin film (a few nm) can be reproductivelyprepared upon the full 4 in. wafers. Moreover; this process gives very small thicknessfluctuations and a small surface roughness.

Effect of the quantum well thickness on the performance of InGaN photovoltaic cells,L Redaelli; A Mukhtarova; S Valdueza-Felip; A Ajay; C Bougerol; C Himwas; J Faure-Vincent; C Durand; J Eymery; E Monroy,We report on the influence of the quantum well thickness on the effective band gap andconversion efficiency of In0. 12Ga0. 88N/GaN multiple quantum well solar cells. The band-to-band transition can be redshifted from 395 to 474 nm by increasing the well thickness from1.3 to 5.4 nm; as demonstrated by cathodoluminescence measurements.

This periodicity is tunablebetween few angstroms to few tenths microns. Moreover; this nanopattern is shown to give along range organization of flat Ge islands.,Semiconductor Wafer Bonding VII: Science; Technology; and Applications: Proceedings of the International Symposium,2003,32

Elastic relaxation in patterned and implanted strained silicon on insulator,S Baudot; F Andrieu; F Rieutord; J Eymery,Mechanical relaxations of strained silicon on insulator (sSOI) nanostructures are studied forthe isolation and implantation processes used in transistor technology. Two model systemsare quantitatively analyzed by grazing incidence x-ray diffraction: long etched sSOI lines ofdifferent widths and bidimensional (2D) sSi samples implanted by As/Xe ions with the samestripe geometry; the gate stack acting as an implantation mask. For sSOI lines; the strain ofthe initial 2D layer is conserved along the longer direction; ie; the transport direction. Alongthe small direction; a large relaxation is observed especially for the smaller widths. Thisrelaxation is almost complete for thicker samples (70 nm); whereas it is much more limitedfor thinner ones (10 nm).

We measure satellite peaks around the {220} reflections comingfrom two periodic dislocation networks localized at the bonding interface. These lateralsuperlattice peaks are explained with a simple continuum model; and their positions giveinformation about the tilt and twist misalignment of the two crystals; as well as the nature andinteractions between the dislocation arrays. The square symmetry of dissociated screwdislocations (twist) and the average alignment of the mixed dislocations (tilt) are observed.The analysis of the satellite truncation rods shows that the strain field is strong enough toaffect the surface; and that the dissociation of screw dislocations has to be taken intoaccount.,Physical Review B,2002,29

We compared those results with the performance of devicesstrained by contact etch stop layer (CESL); for different device orientations (< 110> or<100>) and feature sizes (LG; W). We demonstrate that; similarly to XsSOI; a single tensileCESL can improve both n and pMOS performance; leading to I ON; n= 700 muA/mum and ION; p= 430 muA/mum at I OFF= 140 pA/mum; this for LG< 35 nm; W= 50 nm and V DD= 1 Valong the< 100> direction.,VLSI Technology; 2007 IEEE Symposium on,2007,26
Electronic and optical properties of Si∕ Si O 2 nanostructures. II. Electron-hole recombination at the Si∕ Si O 2 quantum-well–quantum-dot transition,N Pauc; V Calvo; J Eymery; F Fournel; N Magnea,Abstract A photoluminescence (PL) study of crystalline Si∕ Si O 2 quantum wells has beencarried out for thicknesses in the 3.9–0.6 nm range. We show that quantum confinementplays a great role on emission properties of these narrow quantum wells in term of PL lineenergy and quantum efficiency. In particular; for the very-low-thickness domain; a set ofdiscrete and high-energy lines is observed between 1.20 and 1.60 eV and viewed asresulting from two phenomena: the thickness fluctuations of the silicon layer and theappearance of structural barriers in the plane of the thinnest wells due to the formation of atwo-dimensional distribution of Si nanocrystals embedded in Si O 2. A strong increase in thephotoluminescence efficiency is measured for wells pertaining to the very-low-thicknessdomain.,Physical Review B,2005,26
Electronic and optical properties of Si∕ Si O 2 nanostructures. I. Electron-hole collective processes in single Si∕ Si O 2 quantum wells,N Pauc; V Calvo; J Eymery; F Fournel; N Magnea,Abstract Photoluminescence measurements have been performed at low temperature oncrystalline Si∕ Si O 2 quantum wells as a function of thickness. Three distinct electron-hole(eh) phases are clearly identified in these structures: the electron-hole liquid; the electron-hole plasma; and the free-exciton gas. It is shown that spatial confinement induced by the SiO 2 barriers modifies the thermodynamical equilibrium between these phases with respectto the bulk case by changing the steady state of the carrier system and involving newtransient states. In the low-thickness domain; the eh recombination line blueshifts as a resultof the effect of quantum confinement on the band-edge positions. Data are analyzed thanksto a model taking account of the new band-diagram parameters—effective mass; banddegeneracy; anisotropy—and image charges in the dielectric barrier which modify the …,Physical Review B,2005,26
Metal organic vapour-phase epitaxy growth of GaN wires on Si (111) for light-emitting diode applications,Damien Salomon; Amelie Dussaigne; Matthieu Lafossas; Christophe Durand; Catherine Bougerol; Pierre Ferret; Joel Eymery,GaN wires are grown on a Si (111) substrate by metal organic vapour-phase epitaxy on athin deposited AlN blanket and through a thin SiN x layer formed spontaneously at theAlN/Si interface. N-doped wires are used as templates for the growth of core-shellInGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells coated by a p-doped shell.

M-Plane GaN/InAlN multiple quantum wells in core–shell wire structure for UV emission,Christophe Durand; Catherine Bougerol; Jean-François Carlin; Georg Rossbach; Florian Godel; Joël Eymery; Pierre-Henri Jouneau; Anna Mukhtarova; Raphaël Butté; Nicolas Grandjean,We report on the epitaxial growth of high-quality core–shell nonpolar m-plane GaN/InAlNmultiple quantum wells (MQWs) on the sidewall facets of c-oriented hexagonal GaN wires.Pseudomorphic growth without generation of threading dislocations has been establishedfor planar GaN/InAlN (In= 15%) MQWs grown on m-GaN substrates; although m-plane InAlNepilayers cannot be grown perfectly lattice-matched to GaN along the two in-planedirections. Calculations based on elasticity theory indicate that the significant amount ofstrain oriented along the c-axis is the likely factor favoring the formation of cracks along thisdirection. For the core–shell wire geometry; such cracks are not observed; leading to highstructural quality MQWs.

Applications ofthe theory to the binary Au-Ni system are given using the linear muffin-tin orbital method forthe total energy calculations; the cluster variation method for the description of theconfigurational entropy and the Debye-Gruneisen approximation for the vibrational modes.The solubilities of both ends of the phase diagram; calculated with no adjustableparameters; are compared with experiment.,Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter,1994,23
: AU-NI SOLID-SOLUTIONS STUDIED BY NUMERICAL RELAXATION,Joel EYMERY; Frédéric LANCON; Luc BILLARD,Abstract A semi-empirical potential based on the tight-binding second momentapproximation is used to study Au-Ni solid solutions at 0 K. The energy of formation; thetopological disorder; and the elastic constants are analysed within the whole concentrationrange. The results coincide very well with available experiments and may be explained by afrustration of the interatomic bondings by the fcc lattice. The size effect predominates overthe chemical one and the analysis of interstitial sites shows that the local chemicalsurroundings lead to a splitting of the fcc lattice tetrahedral volumes.

Study of the first‐stage relaxation in ZnTe/(001) CdTe strained layers,J Eymery; S Tatarenko; N Bouchet; K Saminadayar,The first stages of the growth of highly strained ZnTe on (001) CdTe are studied in details byreflection high‐energy electron diffraction analysis. Below the critical thickness; small latticeoscillations attributed to a nontetragonal elastic distortion are observed on a system intensile stress. An effect of Zn excess pressure on the critical thickness is demonstrated.Exposure at 280° C of the CdTe (001) surface under Zn flux leads to the formation of ac (2×2) Zn terminated surface with about 50% Zn coverage. Such a pretreatment reduces thecritical thickness by about half a monolayer.,Applied Physics Letters,1994,21
Anisotropic relaxation during the first stages of the growth of ZnTe/(001) CdTe strained layers studied by reflection high energy electron diffraction,J Eymery; B Daudin; D Brun‐Le Cunff; N Boudet; S Tatarenko,The first stages of the growth of highly strained ZnTe on (001) CdTe are studied by reflectionhigh energy electron diffraction (RHEED) with real‐time monitoring of the surface in‐planelattice spacing and of the width of the streaks along the [100];[110]; and [11̄0] azimuths. Alarge; oscillating; elastic relaxation is measured below the critical thickness (≊ 5 ZnTemonolayers) in the [11̄0] azimuth while a small excess of tensile stress with regard to theCdTe substrate is observed in the [110] azimuth. These effects are attributed to ananisotropic nontetragonal elastic distortion at the free edges of elongated 2D ZnTe‐monolayer islands. For large deposition times (ie; after the critical thickness); the RHEEDobservation gives very good information about the nature of the dislocations occurring in themultiplication process.,Applied physics letters,1995,20

Electrical and diffraction characterization of short and narrow MOSFETs on fully depleted strained silicon-on-insulator (sSOI),S Baudot; F Andrieu; O Faynot; J Eymery,Abstract Fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) n and pMOSFETs (Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor-Field-Effect-Transistors) are integrated with a TiN/HfO 2 gate stack on 1.55GPa strained SOI (sSOI) and 2.1 GPa eXtremely strained SOI (XsSOI) substrates. Anelectron mobility enhancement of 135% for a 77 nm gate width is demonstrated as well as asignificant I on–I off improvement for short and narrow nMOS on XsSOI with respect tounstrained SOI. We in-depth analyse this performance boost thanks to the accurateextractions in long and narrow devices of both carrier mobility based on the split-CV methodand strain with grazing incidence X-ray diffraction synchrotron experiments.

A regular surface patterning in the 10–100nm period range is obtained by etching an interface dislocation network obtained by thecontrolled molecular bonding of Si substrates. The depth of the silicon surface profile isincreased by a double etching process. Growth experiments are performed by solid sourcemolecular beam epitaxy (MBE); and for deep trenches; germanium growth conditions areoptimized to obtain one Ge dot per Si mesa. It is shown that the trench depth and the mesaprofile strongly affect the dot size and its coincidence with the initial regular surface network.Anomalous GIXRD measurements are performed to highlight the Ge elastic relaxation …,Surface science,2006,16

Experimental and theoretical analysis of transport properties of core–shell wire light emitting diodes probed by electron beam induced current microscopy,P Lavenus; A Messanvi; L Rigutti; A De Luna Bugallo; H Zhang; F Bayle; FH Julien; J Eymery; C Durand; M Tchernycheva,Abstract We report a systematic experimental and theoretical investigation of core–shellInGaN/GaN single wire light-emitting diodes (LEDs) using electron beam induced current(EBIC) microscopy. The wires were grown by catalyst-free MOVPE and processed intosingle wire LEDs using electron beam lithography on dispersed wires. The influence of theacceleration voltage and of the applied bias on the EBIC maps was investigated. We showthat the EBIC maps provide information both on the minority carrier effects (ie on the local p–n junction collection efficiency) and on the majority carrier effects (ie the transport efficiencyfrom the excited region toward the contacts). Because of a finite core and shell resistance anon-negligible current redistribution into the p–n junction takes place during the majoritycarrier transport.

Nanometric artificial structuring of semiconductor surfaces for crystalline growth,J Eymery; G Biasiol; E Kapon; T Ogino,Abstract The coupling of standard self-organization methods with surface artificialnanostructuring has recently emerged as a promising technique in semiconductor materialsto control simultaneously the size distribution; the density and the position of epitaxialnanostructures. Some physical aspects of the morphology and elastic strain engineering arereviewed in this article. The emphasis is on the effects of capillarity; growth rate anisotropy;strain relaxation and entropy of mixing for alloys. The interplay among these driving forces isfirst illustrated by III–V compound semiconductor growth on lithographically patternedsurfaces; then by germanium growth on implanted substrates and nanopatterned templatesobtained by chemical etching of buried strain dislocation networks.

A thin Fe (211) seed layer is first deposited onthe substrate. This allows the growth of a high-quality gold buffer layer having a 1× 2reconstructed surface. The half-order streaks measured by reflection high-energy diffraction(RHEED) are shifted; indicating a high density of steps.

The Growth of Ni Overlayers on Au (100) Buffers Deposited on GaAs (100) and MgO (100) Substrates.,B Gilles; J Eymery; A Marty; JC Joud; A Chamberod,Abstract High quality single-crystal Au (100) buffers have been grown on GaAs (100) or MgO(100) substrates via a thin bcc Fe (100) nucleation layer. Using RHEED; LEED and Augerspectroscopy the growth of Ni overlayers at room temperature was observed to follow anepitaxial layer-by-layer mode for 2 monolayers; after which islanding occured. Detailedanalysis of the Auger signal reveals that atomic mixing appears within the first completedlayer. Grazing incidence diffraction has been used to investigate the structure of 5–10 nmfilms.

For a gate voltage overdrive of-1 V and a gate length L of 60 nm; p-MOSFETs on SOI (sSOI) with eSiGe exhibit a 37%(18%) saturation drive currentenhancement compared to standard sSOI structures with Si S/D. The low field mobility andseries resistance are extracted in order to understand the performance boost induced by theeSiGe process. The significant I_ON improvement of SOI pMOS with eSiGe S/D compared tosSOI pMOS with Si S/D is attributed to a 65% mobility enhancement and to a 30% series-resistance reduction with respect to sSOI pMOS with Si S/D at L= 60 nm.,IEEE Electron Device Letters,2010,14
Nanometric patterning with ultrathin twist bonded silicon wafers,F Fournel; H Moriceau; N Magnea; J Eymery; D Buttard; JL Rouviere; K Rousseau; B Aspar,Abstract Ultrathin films of silicon bonded on 4-inch (001) silicon wafers have been obtainedby combining a direct hydrophobic silicon bonding technique with a layer transfer. The strainfield produced by the dislocation network localized at the bonded interface is a goodcandidate to induce a long-range order growth of nanostructure. To be able to make thisnew kind of substrate; knowledge of the dislocation strain field extension is essential.Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction allows us to measure its spatial extension through thediffraction peak satellites due to different dislocation networks. The exponential decay ofthese peaks were measured and compared. We found that the decrease of the strain fieldextension is almost two times lower for the screw dislocation network than for the'mixed'dislocations one. The film thickness control is then two times more critical for the …,Thin Solid Films,2000,14
Investigation of the epitaxial growth mechanism of ZnTe on (001) CdTe,S Tatarenko; PH Jouneau; K Saminadayar; J Eymery,The first stages of the growth of highly strained ZnTe on (001) CdTe are investigated byreflection high energy electron diffraction; HRTEM (high resolution transmission electronmicroscopy); x‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy; and x‐ray double diffraction. A precise studyof the factors influencing the critical thickness is presented; with emphasis on the effect of Znpre‐exposure of the CdTe surface on the subsequent ZnTe growth. Below the criticalthickness small lattice distortions attributed to a nontetragonal elastic distortion are detected.An exposure of the (001) CdTe surface to a Zn flux leads to the desorption of the Cd atomspresent on the top of the surface and to the formation of ac (2× 2) reconstructed surface withhalf a monolayer of Zn on the top of the surface.

Self-organized and self-catalyst growth of semiconductor and metal wires by vapour phase epitaxy: GaN rods versus Cu whiskers,Joël Eymery; Xiaojun Chen; Christophe Durand; Matthias Kolb; Gunther Richter,Abstract Wires represent a new class of nanostructures that offer unprecedented freedom inmaterials design and new physical properties. Amongst the very different growthmechanisms reported in literature; the vapour-phase growth of self-catalyzed wires has theadvantages of simplicity and rapidity with a low level of contaminants. The elaborations ofsemiconducting and metallic wires are usually considered as very distinct fields and nosignificant analogies have been noticed yet. This paper illustrates significant similarities ofthe mechanisms involved in the GaN and Cu wire growths that highlight firstly the role of thesubstrate surface preparation (with the deposition of an intermediate layer on the substratesurface impacting the nucleation seeds) and secondly the role of the different diffusion pathscontributing to the one-dimensional growth in particular the influence of the surrounding …,Comptes Rendus Physique,2013,13
Optical properties of single non‐polar GaN quantum dots,F Rol; B Gayral; S Founta; B Daudin; J Eymery; J‐M Gérard; H Mariette; Le Si Dang; D Peyrade,Abstract We present a microphotoluminescence study of non polar GaN/AlN quantum dots(QDs) grown along the [11 equation image 0] axis. Despite the high QD density; singleexciton lines could be isolated on the high energy side of the spectral distribution of the QDarray emission. Linewidths down to 0.5 meV are reported; which is one order of magnitudelower than previously reported linewidths for polar GaN/AlN QDs. This difference isattributed to the drastic reduction of the internal field in non-polar quantum dots.Temperature dependent measurements were performed up to 180 K.(© 2006 WILEY-VCHVerlag GmbH & Co.

The twist and tilt angles between the two crystals are accurately controlled. Theburied Si| Si interface is observed by transmission electron microscopy and by grazingincidence X-ray techniques. For low twist angle values (/spl psi/< 5/spl deg/) plane viewobservations reveal well-defined dislocation networks. Cross-section observations giveevidence that the dislocation networks are localized at the bonding interfacial plane with nothreading dislocation. Grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering measurements confirmthe good quality of the bonding interface as well as the quality of the dislocation networks.Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction is also used and shows the long-range order of theperiodic strain field in the silicon layer.

Controlled Ge quantum dots positioning with nano‐patterned Si (001) substrates,A Bavard; J Eymery; A Pascale; F Fournel,Abstract A square nanometric patterned substrate (period 20 nm) is obtained by direct twistbonding of two twin Si (001) surfaces; thinning and preferential chemical etching. Molecularbeam epitaxy of Ge is carried out on a sample having heterogeneous trench depths toanalyse islands positioning as a function of the surface morphology. Scanning electronmicroscopy observations show that small single dots per mesa or large dots coveringseveral mesas can be observed. It highlights the influence of the mesa aspect ratio on thecontrol of Ge islands self-organization; and suggests the occurrence of an effectiveactivation barrier depending on the surface profile. The position-dependent energy stored ina dot for a given surface profile is estimated from a very simple model based on the balancebetween capillarity and elastic relaxation terms.

Growth of Ge on Si (0 0 1) studied in situ by grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering,F Leroy; J Eymery; D Buttard; G Renaud; R Lazzari,Abstract The growth of Ge/Si (0 0 1) has been followed; in situ; by grazing incidence smallangle X-ray scattering (GISAXS). The Stranski–Krastanov transition was monitored atconstant temperature of 700 K. It is demonstrated that a post-growth annealing at 900 Kmodifies the initial rounded shapes of the dots to a well-defined faceted shape. RecordingGISAXS for grazing angles smaller and larger than the X-ray critical angle of total reflectionshows that the truncation rods of scattering associated with the facets are doubled near thecritical angle. This effect can be explained within the framework of the distorted wave Bornapproximation.,Journal of Crystal Growth,2005,12
Grazing incidence X-ray studies of twist-bonded Si/Si and Si/SiO2 interfaces,D Buttard; J Eymery; F Rieutord; F Fournel; D Lübbert; T Baumbach; H Moriceau,Abstract Twist-bonded Si/Si (0 0 1) and Si/SiO 2 interfaces have been investigated bygrazing incidence X-ray scattering methods. For Si/Si (0 0 1) bonding; conventional X-rayreflectivity reveals the good quality of the interfaces in terms of flatness and roughness. In-plane grazing incidence diffraction measurements around the (2 2 0) reflection showsatellite peaks close to the substrate and the layer diffraction peaks. These sharp satellitesare produced by a periodic displacement resulting from a very regular buried dislocationnetwork.

Dependence of the photovoltaic performance of pseudomorphic InGaN/GaN multiple-quantum-well solar cells on the active region thickness,Anna Mukhtarova; Sirona Valdueza-Felip; Luca Redaelli; Christophe Durand; Catherine Bougerol; Eva Monroy; Joël Eymery,We investigate the photovoltaic performance of pseudomorphic In0. 1Ga0. 9N/GaN multiple-quantum well (MQW) solar cells as a function of the total active region thickness. Anincrease in the number of wells from 5 to 40 improves the short-circuit current and the open-circuit voltage; resulting in a 10-fold enhancement of the overall conversion efficiency.Further increasing the number of wells leads to carrier collection losses due to anincomplete depletion of the active region. Capacitance-voltage measurements point to ahole diffusion length of 48 nm in the MQW region.,Applied Physics Letters,2016,11
Exploring Single Semiconductor Nanowires with a Multimodal Hard X‐ray Nanoprobe,Gema Martínez‐Criado; Jaime Segura‐Ruiz; Benito Alén; Joël Eymery; Andrei Rogalev; Rémi Tucoulou; Alejandro Homs,Abstract Semiconductor nanowires offer new opportunities for optoelectronic and spintronicnanodevices. However; their full potential is ultimately dictated by our ability to controlmultiple property-function relationships taking place at the nanoscale in the spatial and timedomains. Only a combination of high-resolution analytical techniques can provide acomprehensive understanding of their complex functionalities. Here we describe how amultimodal hard X-ray nanoprobe addresses fundamental questions in nanowire research.Selected topics ranging from cluster formation; dopant segregation; and phase separationsto quantum confinement effects are investigated with sub-100 nm spatial resolution and sub-50 ps temporal resolution. This approach opens new avenues for structural; compositionand optical studies with broad applicability in materials science.,Advanced Materials,2014,11
Metallic nano-particles for trapping light,Yongan Tang; Branislav Vlahovic,We study metallic nano-particles for light trapping by investigating the optical absorptionefficiency of the hydrogenated amorphous silicon thin film with and without metallic nano-particles on its top. The size and shape of these nano-particles are investigated as to theirroles of light trapping: scattering light to the absorption medium and converting light tosurface plasmons. The optical absorption enhancement in the red light region (eg; 650nm)due to the light trapping of the metallic nano-particles is observed when a layer of metallicnano-particle array has certain structures. The investigation of the light with incident anglesshows the importance of the coupling efficiency of light to surface plasmons in the metallicnano-particle light trapping. 73.20.

X-ray measurements of the strain and shape of dielectric/metallic wrap-gated InAs nanowires,J Eymery; V Favre-Nicolin; Linus Fröberg; Lars Samuelson,Wrap-gate (111) InAs nanowires (NWs) were studied after HfO 2 dielectric coating and Crmetallic deposition by a combination of grazing incidence x-ray techniques. In-plane and out-of-plane x-ray diffraction (crystal truncation rod analysis) allow determining the strain tensor.The longitudinal contraction; increasing with HfO 2 and Cr deposition; is significantly largerthan the radial dilatation. For the Cr coating; the contraction along the growth axis is quitelarge (− 0.95%); and the longitudinal/radial deformation ratio is> 10; which may play a roleon the NW transport properties. Small angle x-ray scattering shows a smoothening of theinitial hexagonal bare InAs NW shape and gives the respective core/shell thicknesses;which are compared to flat surface values.,Applied Physics Letters,2009,10

Effect of the barrier thickness on the performance of multiple-quantum-well InGaN photovoltaic cells,Luca Redaelli; Anna Mukhtarova; Akhil Ajay; Arántzazu Núñez-Cascajero; Sirona Valdueza-Felip; Joël Bleuse; Christophe Durand; Joël Eymery; Eva Monroy,Abstract The impact of the barrier thickness on the performance of In 0.17 Ga 0.83 N multiple-quantum-well (MQW) solar cells is studied. When the barrier thickness is reduced from 9.0 to3.7 nm; the effect of the internal polarization fields on the MQW band structure results in ablueshift of the cell photoresponse. At the same time; the overlap of the fundamental electronand hole wave-functions in the quantum wells increases and the carrier extraction by field-assisted tunneling is enhanced; impacting the external quantum efficiency and fill-factor ofthe cells. The experimental results show that the performance of the thinner-barrier cellsstudied in this work is superior; or at least comparable to the performance of their thicker-barrier counterparts; in spite of the smaller total thickness of their absorbing region. This isdue to their higher external quantum efficiency (37% at 370 nm) and improved fill-factor …,Japanese Journal of Applied Physics,2015,9
(001) silicon surfacial grain boundaries obtained by direct wafer bonding process: accurate control of the structure before bonding,K Rousseau*; J Eymery; F Fournel; J-P Morniroli; J-L Rouvière,Ultra-thin (001) silicon films bonded onto (001) silicon wafers; which form 'surfacial grainboundaries'; are analysed by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Theaim of this study is to find a way of controlling precisely; before direct wafer bonding; thestructure of the Si/Si (001) interface. Two kinds of dislocation networks are found at thebonded interface. A square array of screw dislocations accommodates the twist between thetwo crystals; whereas a linear network of mixed dislocations accommodates the tilt resultingfrom the residual vicinality of the initial surfaces. A theoretical study shows that knowing andchoosing before bonding the characteristics of these interfacial dislocations depend on thecontrol of the 'twist'angle during the hydrophobic molecular bonding process.

Grazing incidence x-ray scattering investigation of Si surface patterned with buried dislocation networks,F Leroy; J Eymery; D Buttard; G Renaud; R Lazzari; F Fournel,Investigation of a surface patterned by buried dislocation networks is performed with grazingincidence x-ray scattering (GIXS). It is shown that surface long-range undulations lead to aazimuth-dependent diffusion spot; the scattering vector of which is mainly parallel to the x-ray propagation direction. This unusual scattering direction with GIXS is explained by thescales of the scattering objects.

GaN wire-based Langmuir–Blodgett films for self-powered flexible strain sensors,S Salomon; J Eymery; E Pauliac-Vaujour,Abstract We report a highly flexible strain sensor which exploits the piezoelectric propertiesof ultra-long gallium nitride (GaN) wires. Langmuir–Blodgett assembled wires areencapsulated in a dielectric material (parylene-C); which is sandwiched between two planarelectrodes in a capacitor-like configuration.

Time-dependent relaxation of strained silicon-on-insulator lines using a partially coherent x-ray nanobeam,Francesca Mastropietro; Joël Eymery; Gerardina Carbone; Sophie Baudot; François Andrieu; Vincent Favre-Nicolin,Abstract We report on the quantitative determination of the strain map in a strained silicon-on-insulator line with a 200× 70 nm 2 cross section. In order to study a single line as a functionof time; we used an x-ray nanobeam with relaxed coherence properties as a compromisebetween beam size; coherence; and intensity. We demonstrate how it is possible to refinethe line deformation map at the nanoscale; and follow its evolution as the line relaxes underthe influence of the x-ray nanobeam. We find that the strained line flattens itself underirradiation but maintains the same linear strain (ϵ zz unchanged).,Physical review letters,2013,8

Growth and characterization of ZnO nanowires on p-type GaN,IC Robin; M Lafossas; J Garcia; M Rosina; E Latu-Romain; P Ferret; P Gilet; A Tchelnokov; M Azize; J Eymery; G Feuillet,Abstract ZnO nanowires were grown by catalyst-free metal-organic vapour-phase epitaxy ontop of a p-type GaN buffer. The optical properties of the ZnO nanowires were investigated bytemperature-dependent and time-resolved photoluminescence and compared to those ofZnO nanowires directly grown on sapphire. The luminescence intensity decrease withtemperature of the nanowires grown on GaN reveals an original behavior since it is constantover 120 K; showing the existence of strong localization centers. In addition; the temperature-dependent decay time measurements indicate a lower density of non-radiative channels forthe nanowires grown on GaN.,Microelectronics Journal,2009,8

This template is used to organisethe germanium quantum dot growth. The initial surface morphology as well as the quantumdot position and size are studied by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).

Width and orientation effects in strained FDSOI MOSFETs: Strain and device characterization,S Baudot; J Eymery; F Andrieu; V Vidal; F Allain; L Brévard; O Faynot,We integrated Fully Depleted Silicon-On-Insulator (FDSOI) n and pMOSFETs on (1.16percent; 2.1 GPa) eXtremely strained SOI (XsSOI) substrates. We demonstrate a 135%electron mobility enhancement at W= 77nm and a significant I ON-I OFF improvement forshort and narrow nMOS on XsSOI compared to unstrained SOI. We in-depth analyze thisperformance boost thanks to accurate extractions in narrow devices of both the carriermobility (after adaptation of the split-CV method) and the strain (by X-Ray Diffractionperformed in synchrotron facility). This improvement depends on the channel orientation andis partly attributed to the tensile strain induced by the TiN gate and partly by the effectivemass improvement under high and non-biaxial strain.,Solid State Device Research Conference; 2009.

Surface evolution of strained thin solid films: Stability analysis and time evolution of local surface perturbations,E Dornel; JC Barbe; J Eymery; F de Crecy,A discrete formulation of the surface diffusion potential is developed taking into account boththe capillarity and the elasticity contributions. This potential; also valid in the large curvatureregime; is applied to study the surface evolution of strained thin solid films. The home madenumerical tool MoveFilm; used to track the surface evolution due to surface diffusion; iscoupled to a finite element solver Cast3M to calculate the mechanical problem.

Buried hydrophobic silicon bonding studied by high-energy x-ray reflectivity,D Buttard; F Rieutord; J Eymery; F Fournel; B Bataillou,Abstract The non-conventional technique of high-energy x-ray reflectivity is used toinvestigate buried Si| Si interface obtained by hydrophobic wafer bonding. In this experimentthe well-collimated beam is transmitted through the sample and is reflected by the bondinginterface described by its density and width. Transmission x-ray reflectivity curves are fittedusing this two-parameter model with a Gaussian or exponential profile to analyse theevolution of the bonding interface as a function of temperature from 250 C to 1100 C.,Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics,2003,2
Large and small angle x-ray scattering studies of Si/SiGe superlattices grown by gas-source molecular beam epitaxy,JM Hartmann; J Eymery; V Calvo,Abstract We have performed large and small angle x-ray scattering measurements on Si/Si0.7 Ge 0.3 superlattices grown by gas-source molecular beam epitaxy. The thickness of theSi and SiGe layers as well as their Ge content were extracted through a correlation betweenlarge-angle x-ray diffraction and photoluminescence measurements. A SiGe growth rateenhancement was observed during the first stages of the SiGe layer deposition; which mightbe due to a slow build-up of the Ge surface population. The Fresnel optical method wasused to analyse the small-angle specular x-ray reflectivity data. The interface root meansquare roughness; 7±1 Å for the samples grown at 520 and 580 C; and 5±1 Å for the samplegrown at 550 C; are quite comparable to those found in Si/SiGe superlattices grown by solidsource MBE.

X-ray reflectivity of silicon on insulator wafers,J Eymery; F Rieutord; F Fournel; D Buttard; H Moriceau,Abstract The ability of X-ray reflectivity to analyse different silicon on insulator structures isunderlined. The standard geometry with first reflection occurring at the surface givesinformation about the thickness; roughness; and density of the layers. Deeply buriedinterfaces; ie in between thick wafers; are analysed with a non-standard geometry (the firstreflection occurs at the buried interface) and with a high-energy radiation. These twomethods are; respectively; illustrated by the reflectivity measurements of (SiO 2/Si/SiO 2|bulk Si) and (bulk Si/thermal SiO 2| native SiO 2/bulk Si) bonded structures; and areexplained in the framework of kinematic theory of X-ray reflectivity.,Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing,2001,2
Localized destructive interference in X-ray specular reflectivity,J Eymery,Localized destructive interference can be obtained for specific values of the angle ofincidence when studying semiconductor superlattices with X-ray reflectivity at fixedwavelength. Kinematical calculations show that the difference between the real parts of therefractive index of the layers must be small; and that the number of superlattice periods mustbe optimized to enhance the destructive interference. An experimental example; involving aCdTe/CdZnTe superlattice; and optical matrix simulations for SiGe/Si superlattices arepresented to illustrate this effect. Finally; it is shown that such structures can be tailored to actas energy filters at fixed angles of incidence.,Journal of applied crystallography,1999,2
X-ray reflectivity study of porous silicon formation,Virginie Chamard; G Dolino; J Eymery,Abstract X-ray reflectometry is used to study the first stages of formation of thin n-type poroussilicon layers. Results on classical n−-type porous silicon prepared under illumination arefirst reported. Then; the effect of the illumination during the formation is observed bycomparing n+/−-type samples prepared in darkness or under illumination. X-ray specularreflectivity measurements allow to observe an increase of the surface porosity even for theshort formation times and a macroporous layer under the nanoporous layer is also identifiedfor illuminated samples. The presence of a crater at the top of the layer is observed byprofilometer measurements; especially in the case of illuminated samples. Specular anddiffuse x-ray scattering results show important effects of light during the porous siliconformation.,MRS Online Proceedings Library Archive,1998,2
X-ray-diffraction study of the lattice distortions induced by a fractional monolayer: ZnTe embedded in vicinal CdTe (001),N Boudet; J Eymery; N Magnéa,Abstract The distortion gradient of the interplanar distances induced by a ZnTe fractionalmonolayer embedded in vicinal B-type CdTe (001) is analyzed within a kinematical modelfrom the diffuse scattering near the (004) Bragg peak of the substrate (scans along [00l]). It isexplained how these x-ray measurements allow us to extract the relevant structuralparameters of the sample. With this method; only the planes with distortions along thegrowth direction and without local bending give a significant contribution to the diffusescattering along [00l]. The measured diffuse intensity only comes from a fraction of thesample volume. It is shown that the elasticity theory is very well verified in the monolayerlimit by comparing the strains predicted by this theory to ab initio pseudopotentialcalculations.

Silane-Induced N-Polarity in Wires Probed by a Synchrotron Nanobeam,Damien Salomon; Agnes Messanvi; Joël Eymery; Gema Martínez-Criado,Noncentrosymmetric one-dimensional structures are key driving forces behind advancednanodevices. Owing to the critical role of silane injection in creating nanosized architectures;it has become a challenge to investigate the induced local lattice polarity in single GaNwires. Thus; if axial and radial structures are well-grown by a silane-mediated approach; anideal model to study their polar orientations is formed. By combining synchrotron X-rayfluorescence and X-ray excited optical luminescence; we show here experimental evidenceof the role of silane to promote the N-polarity; light emission; and elemental incorporationwithin single wires. In addition; our experiment demonstrates the ability to spatially examinecarrier diffusion phenomena without electrical contacts; opening new avenues for furtherstudies with simultaneous optical and elemental sensitivity at the nanoscale.,Nano letters,2017,1

In particular; NWs are highly attractive asbuilding blocks for III-nitride semiconductor devices. In the study of quantum dots; discs andother insertions; the assessment of optical properties with high spatial resolution (~ 1 nm)and full spectroscopic capabilities becomes of major importance.

Growth of organised nano-objects on prepatterned surfaces,Margrit Hanbücken; Joël Eymery; Sylvie Rousset,The invention of near-field microscopy; and in particular; scanning tunneling microscopy [1]and the pioneering work of Don Eigler [2] at IBM Almaden; led to a surge of interest in themanipulation of atoms and molecules. It is the method of choice for investigating individualnanometric-sized objects (which we shall refer to as nano-objects in this chapter). However;the idea of atomby-atom or molecule-by-molecule manipulation has its own intrinsic limits.For the parallel fabrication of periodically spaced nano-objects of controlled size; self-organised growth on previously structured surfaces (we shall call these prepatterned orprestructured surfaces here) is a novel nanofabrication tool which turns out to be both simpleand economical. Regularity in size is crucial when studying the physical properties ofnanostructures (as a function of their size; shape and interactions); because the majority …,*,2007,1
Electron hole liquid in silicon single quantum wells,N Pauc; V Calvo; J Eymery; F Fournel; N Magnea,Abstract We have carried out photoluminescence measurements on the two dimensionalelectron hole liquid in perfectly crystalline Si quantum wells with SiO 2 barriers. Thecondensation of excitons in an EHL is strongly enhanced in 2D geometry. Formation ofliquid nanodroplets with size varying with laser power is seen. Carriers are submitted to aquantum confinement regime for sufficiently small thickness. We present a model taking intoaccount 2D many-body effects and the increase of the Coulomb interaction due to thedielectric mismatch between the Si well and the dielectric barrier.

X-ray characterization of bonding interfaces,Francois Rieutord; Hubert Moriceau; Christophe Morales; Joel Eymery,Wafer bonding has been established as a technique suitable to produce sharp interfacesbetween different materials. However the exact structure of the interface at the different stepsof the bonding process is poorly known; due to the difficulty of investigating such a narrowinterface buried under macroscopic thickness of material. Yet; many structural changesoccur during the wafer bonding process as demonstrated eg by the adhesion energyincrease with annealing. Among the different techniques available to study bondinginterfaces; high resolution transmission electron microscopy on thinned slices can be used[1; 2] but the cross-sections obtained enables hardly one to get an averaged in-plane view ofthe interface. We shall present here the X-ray reflection technique which combines the largepenetration depth of X-rays to their nanometer level sensitivity [3; 4].

Investigations of buried Interfaces using high energy X-ray reflectivity,F Rieutord; J Eymery; O Plantevin; B Bataillou; D Buttard; F Fournel,Abstract X-ray reflectivity using high-energy X-rays allows one to characterize interfacesbetween thick materials at nanometer scale. The technique combines the high penetration ofX-rays allowing the crossing of the radiation through large thicknesses of material with theinterface sensitivity of grazing angle techniques. In the case of a buried interface betweentwo thick materials; the beam enters the sample through the side of one material andcontributions of external surfaces are suppressed. Then; the technique is sensitive to theinterface structure only. Examples are given using wafer bonding interfaces; both in thehydrophilic case (as used eg in Silicon-On-Insulator substrate fabrication) and in thehydrophobic case (Silicon/Silicon bonding).,MRS Online Proceedings Library Archive,2001,1

A largesquare support of 90x90 pixels is used as a primary support in the Shrink-‐Wrap procedure.After 5 cycles of 50 ER followed by 100 HIO; a shrinking procedure is used to decrease thesize of the support: we remove pixels from the edge of the support with a threshold of 25% ofthe average modulus. A new iteration is done with the updated support (5 cycles of 50 ERfollowed by 100 HIO) ended with the same shrinking procedure. This shrinking procedureslows down around the 140th iteration as shown by the drawing of the support size as afunction of the iteration number (Fig. S1).

Crystallographic orientation of facets and planar defects in functional nanostructures elucidated by nano-focused coherent diffractive x-ray imaging,Marie-Ingrid Richard; Sara Fernandez; Joel Eymery; Jan Philipp Hofmann; Lu Gao; Jérôme Carnis; Stéphane Labat; Vincent Favre-Nicolin; Emiel JM Hensen; Olivier Thomas; Tobias Schulli; Steven Leake,The physical and chemical properties of nanostructures depend on their surface facets.Here; we exploit a pole figure approach to determine the three-dimensional orientationmatrix of a nanostructure from a single Bragg reflection measured with a coherent nano-focused x-ray beam. The signature of any truncated (faceted) crystal produces a crystaltruncation rod; which corresponds to a streak of intensity in reciprocal space normal to thesurface. When two or more non-parallel facets are present; both the crystal orientation andthe crystal facets can be identified. This enables facets to be rapidly indexed and uncommonfacets; and planar defects; that have been difficult to study before to be identified.

Thermal Evolution of Implantation Damages in Mg-Implanted GaN Layers Grown on Si,Aurélien Lardeau-Falcy; Marianne Coig; Matthew Charles; Christophe Licitra; Joël Kanyandekwe; Frederic Milesi; Joel Eymery; Frédéric Mazen,Abstract We report on the structural characterization of Mg-implanted and annealed GaNlayer on Si (111). Anneals ranging from 400 C to 1100 C are performed on samplesimplanted with 10 13-10 15 at/cm² Mg doses. A comparative study of the evolution of thedamage in these samples as a function of annealing temperatures and implanted doses isperformed by using photoluminescence (PL) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). For low Mg dose;the induced strain; measured via XRD; can be relaxed at relatively low temperature; ie 500C; while a 1000 C anneal is required for higher dose. PL characteristics bands of Mgimplanted in GaN are evidenced. Comparison of XRD and PL results show that the straincorrection and the increase of the PL signal are not simultaneous.

Metal positioning on silicon surfaces using the etching of buried dislocation arrays,A Bavard; F Fournel; J Eymery,Abstract Large-area Si (001) nanopatterned surfaces obtained by etching dislocation linearrays have been used to drive the positioning of metallic islands. A method combiningwafer bonding of (001) silicon on insulator layers and preferential chemical etching allowscontrolling the periodicity of square trench arrays in the 20–50 nm lateral periodicity rangewith an accuracy of less than 1 nm and a depth of about 4–5 nm. The interfacial areacontaining the dislocation line plane can be removed and a single crystal maintaining themorphological patterning can be obtained. It is shown that oxidized or deoxidized siliconnanopatterned surfaces can drive the positioning of Ni; Au and Ag islands for a 20 nm lateralperiodicity and that a lateral long range order; directly transferred from the dislocationnetwork; can be obtained in the Ni and Au cases.,Nanotechnology,2011,*
From silicon direct wafer bonding to surface nano-patterning: a way to innovative substrate elaboration,F Fournel; A Bavard; J Eymery,Self-assembled configurations of nanostructures are expected to play an increasinglyimportant role in devices design; as an alternative to conventional microelectronicstechnology. Conventional techniques are generally limited by the lack of simultaneouscontrol on positioning; density and size uniformity of the nanostructures. To overcome theseproblems a new substrate based on controlled direct twist wafer bonding and preferentialchemical etching has been developed.,SOI Conference; 2009 IEEE International,2009,*

Stress and Strain Measurement in Stressed Silicon Lines,A Béché; JL Rouvière; JC Barbé; F Andrieu; D Rouchon; J Eymery; M Mermoux,Summary Stressed Si lines are attractive conduction channels for transistors due to theimprovement of the carrier velocity. The stress and strain in 1 μm width Si lines on top ofsilicon oxide have been characterized by analysing plan view Moiré patterns obtained bytransmission electron microscopy (TEM) and comparing them with Raman spectroscopy andX-ray diffraction results. A good agreement is found between experimental measurementsand results from simulations; which validates our approach of measuring structuraldeformation by Moiré fringes. Regions having a Si substrate thicker than 400nm produceMoiré period profiles similar to the ones that would be obtained on the initial thick wafer. Therelaxation of the stress at the edge of the lines is clearly shown in Moiré fringe images.,*,2008,*

Controlled Silicon (001) Surface Periodic Nanopatterning by Direct Wafer Bonding,Alexis Bavard; Jérôme Mézière; Frank Fournel; Alina Pascale; Pascal Gentile; Joel Eymery,Abstract In order to control simultaneously the nanostructures size; density and positioning;nanopatterned substrates are elaborated using an original process based on the revelationby preferential chemical etching up to the surface of a buried square dislocation networkobtained by direct twist wafer bonding. By including the dislocation network into a SOIsubstrate thin film the surface patterning evolution during the selective chemical etching for20 and 50 nm periodicity samples is controlled and checked by Scanning ElectronMicroscopy (SEM).

Periodic Nanometric Silicon Surface Patterning Using Direct Wafer Bonding,Frank Fournel; Jerome Meziere; Alexis Bavard; JocL Eymery; Pascal Gentile; Alina Pascale,Due to the twist misorientation of two (001) silicon surfaces; the direct bonding producessquare nanometric networks of dislocations localized nearby the bonding interface. Despiteclassical direct bonding which also produces unavoidable mixed dislocation network; anoriginal process [1] allows to eliminate this undesirable network and to accurately control thedislocation square network period at the nanometer scale (cf. Fig. 1). Such an unique andgiant grain boundary has been achieved on a full 100mm size wafer and below an ultra-thinsilicon layer (< 10nm). We have also managed to elaborate a SOI substrate including asquare periodic dislocation network in the thin SOI silicon film (cf. Fig. 2). In both cases; aYang-etch type mixture (HF/H20/CrO3) has been used to nanopattern the surfaces [2] ofthese “twisted” substrates.

Optical properties of ultra thin single Si/SiO/sub 2/quantum wells,N Pauc; V Calvo; J Eymery; F Fournel; N Magnea,Efficient light emission from silicon is a key for the realization of photonic devices on siliconsubstrates. Many routes deserve to be explored in the search for the ideal Si-based emitter; suchas highly luminescent implanted silicon [1] or efficient light extraction from patterned Silicon OnInsulator (SOI) [2]. An alternative solution for the enhancement of the internal Quantum Efficiency(QE) lies in increasing the part of electron hole (eh) radiative recombination in Si/SiO2 nanostructuresthanks to very strong carrier localization. This principle applies in silicon nanocrystals(nc-Si); but no study has been performed to account for the effect of strong localization in ultrathin Si/SiO2 quantum wells (QWs) and subsequent changes in the electronic properties whenthe thickness decrease involves the 2D quantum well-0D quantum dot structural transition …Fig. 1: Cross sectional view of an ultra thin Si/SiO2 QW acquired with Transmission …,Group IV Photonics; 2005. 2nd IEEE International Conference on,2005,*

Photoluminescence of nanometric single silicon quantum wells,N Pauc; V Calvo; J Eymery; F Fournel; N Magnea,Abstract We performed low temperature photoluminescence studies on nanometricthickness silicon single quantum wells. We show that electron hole recombination spectraare strongly dependent on the well thickness t and that carriers are in a strong quantumconfinement regime for t⩽ 3 nm. A set of fixed lines is identified and attributed to discrete andconfined ground state levels or activated trap levels. A significant increase in the quantumefficiency is observed in the confinement regime and is associated with the progressivetransformation of the Si layer into a planar distribution of two dimensional “nanoplates”.,Optical Materials,2005,*

Shifts,Olivier Plantevin; J Eymery; TU Schülli; P Gentile; D Buttard; F Fournel,In-plane reciprocal space mapping and anomalous x-ray diffraction has been employed tostudy the structural and compositional properties of a Ge deposit onto a prepatterned Si-substrate. The prepatterned substrate is obtained in the following way: a single Si (001)wafer is cut into “twin” slices with an implantation plus a separation process; then we bondthe “twin” surfaces again with a controlled relative in-plane rotation (1 in the analysedsample). This twist leads to a regular square grid of srew dislocations [1]; and a chemicaletching of the sample leads to a square mesa array with a periodicity of about 22 nm [2]. Twosamples have been characterized before and after a Ge-deposition of 9 Å (6.4 ML) on top ofthe mesa array. In-plane reciprocal space maps in the vicinity of the Si (440) reflection ofthese samples are shown in Fig. 1 for the corrugated Si surface (a) and for the sample …,*,2004,*

c (2x2) Cd and (2x1) Te surface reconstructions of CdTe (001): ab initio and STM studies,J Eymery; D Martrou,Abstract Using first principles total-energy pseudopotential calculations and scanningtunneling microscopy; we study the local aspects of the Cd-terminated c (2x2) and Te-terminated (2x1) reconstructions of the CdTe (001) surface. The Cd c (2x2) surface is avacancy structure with an half coverage of the Cd top surface layer without mixing with otherreconstruction. The surface Cd atom relaxes towards the second layer Te atoms to have ansp hydridization and to become nearly coplanar. The Te dimerized (2x1) reconstruction isformed above 280^ oC under a Te flux and presents a high density of defaults dueprincipally to Te coverage larger than one. In the perfect structure; the charge transfer fromthe cation dangling bond to the anion dangling bond induces an outward relaxation of theTe atoms and the electrons in the Te-Te dimer bond show the behavior of pi bonds.

Vertical self ordering in submonolayer ZnTe/CdTe superlattices studied by small angle X-ray diffusion.,J Eymery; D Martrou,Abstract Three superlattices: 10x (n ML CdTe/(0.5 ML ZnTe+ 0.5 ML CdTe) have beengrown by MBE on nominal CdTe (001) with n= 20; 60; 90 and studied at the Zn Kalphaabsorption edge in the ESRF/D2AM beam line. Large angle X-ray measurements are firstperformed to get the ZnTe coverage; then the specular reflectivity is analyzed with the opticalmatrix method to get the interface roughness and the layer thickness. Rocking scans givethe in-plane correlation of ZnTe islands. This information is compared to the island sizedetermined by STM on nearly identical samples. Offset scans are used to get the out-of-plane correlation between the interfaces. According to the variation of the elastic fieldresulting from the strong lattice mismatch between CdTe and ZnTe (about 6%); it is shownthat the correlation decreases when the CdTe spacer thickness increases.

Nanowires are assembled into a capacitive structure on a flexiblesubstrate using the Langmuir-Blodgett method [2]. As the nanowire geometry (ie L andalpha) depends on the growth conditions; the response of the device with embeddednanowires may vary accordingly.

To overcome these difficulties; westudy a method to pattern substrates (1); with a controlled periodicity at the nanometer-scale;that can be applied on the full wafer. Two “twin” surfaces of Si (001); produced by thesplitting of a single wafer are bonded together (2). The inplane rotation angle between thetwo crystals defines a square network of screw dislocations.

Surface self-organization with buried dislocation,J Eymery,To pursue the race to miniaturization of electronics; self-assembled configurations ratherthan artificially drawn structures are expected to play a major role in the design ofnanometric devices. Many methods of self-assembling have been proposed ranging fromepitaxy to colloïds but the majority of them suffer invariably from a statistical yield in thecontrol of size and spatial position of the nanostructures. Our recent research has beenfocused to develop a way to control the lateral ordering of nanostructures at the waferscale.The lateral self-organization is obtained by the preferential patterning of a solidsurface with local strain or morphology created by a periodic array of buried stressors. Thisarray is formed artificially by the dislocations appearing at the interface of two clean identicalsilicon (001) crystals bonded with a crystallographic disorientation. Such hydrophobic …,*,*,*
