t-closeness: Privacy beyond k-anonymity and l-diversity,Ninghui Li; Tiancheng Li; Suresh Venkatasubramanian,The k-anonymity privacy requirement for publishing microdata requires that eachequivalence class (ie; a set of records that are indistinguishable from each other with respectto certain" identifying" attributes) contains at least k records. Recently; several authors haverecognized that k-anonymity cannot prevent attribute disclosure. The notion of l-diversity hasbeen proposed to address this; l-diversity requires that each equivalence class has at least lwell-represented values for each sensitive attribute. In this paper we show that l-diversityhas a number of limitations. In particular; it is neither necessary nor sufficient to preventattribute disclosure. We propose a novel privacy notion called t-closeness; which requiresthat the distribution of a sensitive attribute in any equivalence class is close to thedistribution of the attribute in the overall table (ie; the distance between the two …,Data Engineering; 2007.

Design of a role-based trust-management framework,Ninghui Li; John C Mitchell; William H Winsborough,We introduce the RT framework; a family of role-based trust management languages forrepresenting policies and credentials in distributed authorization. RT combines the strengthsof role-based access control and trust-management systems and is especially suitable forattribute-based access control. Using a few simple credential forms; RT provides localizedauthority over roles; delegation in role definition; linked roles; and parameterized roles. RTalso introduces manifold roles; which can be used to express threshold and separation-of-duty policies; and delegation of role activations. We formally define the semantics ofcredentials in the RT framework by presenting a translation from credentials to Datalogrules. This translation also shows that this semantics is algorithmically tractable.,Security and Privacy; 2002. Proceedings. 2002 IEEE Symposium on,2002,1006
Distributed credential chain discovery in trust management,Ninghui Li; William H Winsborough; John C Mitchell,Abstract We introduce a simple Role-based Trust-management language RT 0 and a set-theoretic semantics for it. We also introduce credential graphs as a searchablerepresentation of credentials in RT 0 and prove that reachability in credential graphs issound and complete with respect to the semantics of RT 0. Based on credential graphs; wegive goal-directed algorithms to do credential chain discovery in RT 0; both when credentialstorage is centralized and when credential storage is distributed. A goal-directed algorithmbegins with an access-control query and searches for credentials relevant to the query;while avoiding considering the potentially very large number of credentials that areunrelated to the access-control decision at hand. This approach provides better expected-case performance than bottom-up algorithms. We show how our algorithms can be …,Journal of Computer Security,2003,521
Delegation logic: A logic-based approach to distributed authorization,Ninghui Li; Benjamin N Grosof; Joan Feigenbaum,Abstract We address the problem of authorization in large-scale; open; distributed systems.Authorization decisions are needed in electronic commerce; mobile-code execution; remoteresource sharing; privacy protection; and many other applications. We adopt the trust-management approach; in which" authorization" is viewed as a" proof-of-compliance"problem: Does a set of credentials prove that a request complies with a policy? We developa logic-based language; called Delegation Logic (DL); to represent policies; credentials; andrequests in distributed authorization. In this paper; we describe D1LP; the monotonic versionof DL. D1LP extends the logic-programming (LP) language Datalog with expressivedelegation constructs that feature delegation depth and a wide variety of complex principals(including; but not limited to; k-out-of-n thresholds).

Towards practical automated trust negotiation,William H Winsborough; Ninghui Li,Exchange of attribute credentials is a means to establish mutual trust between strangers thatwish to share resources or conduct business transactions. Automated Trust Negotiation(ATN) is an approach to regulate the exchange of sensitive credentials by using accesscontrol policies. Existing ATN work makes unrealistic simplifying assumptions aboutcredential-representation languages and credential storage. Moreover while existing workprotects the transmission of credentials; it fails to hide the contents of credentials; thusproviding uncontrolled access to potentially sensitive attributes. To protect information aboutsensitive attributes; we introduce the notion of attribute acknowledgment policies (Ackpolicies). We then introduce the trust target graph (TTG) protocol; which supports a morerealistic credential language; Ack policies; and distributed storage of credentials.,Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks; 2002.

Efficient k-anonymization using clustering techniques,Ji-Won Byun; Ashish Kamra; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li,Abstract k-anonymization techniques have been the focus of intense research in the last fewyears. An important requirement for such techniques is to ensure anonymization of datawhile at the same time minimizing the information loss resulting from data modifications. Inthis paper we propose an approach that uses the idea of clustering to minimize informationloss and thus ensure good data quality. The key observation here is that data records thatare naturally similar to each other should be part of the same equivalence class. We thusformulate a specific clustering problem; referred to as k-member clustering problem. Weprove that this problem is NP-hard and present a greedy heuristic; the complexity of which isin O (n 2). As part of our approach we develop a suitable metric to estimate the informationloss introduced by generalizations; which works for both numeric and categorical data.,*,2007,312
Purpose based access control of complex data for privacy protection,Ji-Won Byun; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li,Abstract As privacy becomes a major concern for both consumers and enterprises; manyresearch efforts have been devoted to the development of privacy protecting technology. Werecently proposed a privacy preserving access control model for relational databases; wherepurpose information associated with a given data element specifies the intended use of thedata element. In this paper; we extend our previous work to handle other advanced datamanagementsystems; such as the ones based on XML and the ones based on the object-relational data model. Another contribution of our paper isthat we address the problem ofhow to determine the purpose forwhich certain data are accessed by a given user. Ourproposedsolution relies on the well-known RBAC model as well as the notionof conditionalrole which is based on the notions of role attributeand system attribute.,Proceedings of the tenth ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2005,302
Datalog with constraints: A foundation for trust management languages,Ninghui Li; John C Mitchell,Abstract Trust management (TM) is a promising approach for authorization and accesscontrol in distributed systems; based on signed distributed policy statements expressed in apolicy language. Although several TM languages are semantically equivalent to subsets ofDatalog; Datalog is not suffciently expressive for ifne-grained control of structured resources.We define the class of linearly decomposable unary constraint domains; prove that Datalogextended with constraints in any combination of such constraint domains is tractable; andshow that permissions associated with structured resources fall into this class. We alsopresent a concrete declarative TM language; RT C 1; based on constraint Datalog; and useconstraint Datalog to analyze another TM system; KeyNote; which turns out to be lessexpressive than RT C 1 in significant respects; yet less tractable in the worst case …,*,2003,293
Using probabilistic generative models for ranking risks of android apps,Hao Peng; Chris Gates; Bhaskar Sarma; Ninghui Li; Yuan Qi; Rahul Potharaju; Cristina Nita-Rotaru; Ian Molloy,Abstract One of Android's main defense mechanisms against malicious apps is a riskcommunication mechanism which; before a user installs an app; warns the user about thepermissions the app requires; trusting that the user will make the right decision. Thisapproach has been shown to be ineffective as it presents the risk information of each app ina" tand-alone" ashion and in a way that requires too much technical knowledge and time todistill useful information. We introduce the notion of risk scoring and risk ranking for Androidapps; to improve risk communication for Android apps; and identify three desiderata for aneffective risk scoring scheme. We propose to use probabilistic generative models for riskscoring schemes; and identify several such models; ranging from the simple Naive Bayes; toadvanced hierarchical mixture models.

Purpose based access control for privacy protection in relational database systems,Ji-Won Byun; Ninghui Li,Abstract In this article; we present a comprehensive approach for privacy preserving accesscontrol based on the notion of purpose. In our model; purpose information associated with agiven data element specifies the intended use of the data element. A key feature of ourmodel is that it allows multiple purposes to be associated with each data element and alsosupports explicit prohibitions; thus allowing privacy officers to specify that some data shouldnot be used for certain purposes. An important issue addressed in this article is thegranularity of data labeling; ie; the units of data with which purposes can be associated. Weaddress this issue in the context of relational databases and propose four different labelingschemes; each providing a different granularity. We also propose an approach to representpurpose information; which results in low storage overhead; and we exploit query …,The VLDB Journal,2008,234
Android permissions: a perspective combining risks and benefits,Bhaskar Pratim Sarma; Ninghui Li; Chris Gates; Rahul Potharaju; Cristina Nita-Rotaru; Ian Molloy,Abstract The phenomenal growth of the Android platform in the past few years has made it alucrative target of malicious application (app) developers. There are numerous instances ofmalware apps that send premium rate SMS messages; track users' private data; or apps that;even if not characterized as malware; conduct questionable actions affecting the user'sprivacy or costing them money. In this paper; we investigate the feasibility of using both thepermissions an app requests; the category of the app; and what permissions are requestedby other apps in the same category to better inform users whether the risks of installing anapp is commensurate with its expected benefit. Existing approaches consider only the risksof the permissions requested by an app and ignore both the benefits and what permissionsare requested by other apps; thus having a limited effect. We propose several risk signals …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies,2012,223
On the tradeoff between privacy and utility in data publishing,Tiancheng Li; Ninghui Li,Abstract In data publishing; anonymization techniques such as generalization andbucketization have been designed to provide privacy protection. In the meanwhile; theyreduce the utility of the data. It is important to consider the tradeoff between privacy andutility. In a paper that appeared in KDD 2008; Brickell and Shmatikov proposed anevaluation methodology by comparing privacy gain with utility gain resulted fromanonymizing the data; and concluded that" even modest privacy gains require almostcomplete destruction of the data-mining utility". This conclusion seems to undermine existingwork on data anonymization. In this paper; we analyze the fundamental characteristics ofprivacy and utility; and show that it is inappropriate to directly compare privacy with utility.We then observe that the privacy-utility tradeoff in data publishing is similar to the risk …,Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2009,220
Secure anonymization for incremental datasets,Ji-Won Byun; Yonglak Sohn; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li,Abstract Data anonymization techniques based on the k-anonymity model have been thefocus of intense research in the last few years. Although the k-anonymity model and therelated techniques provide valuable solutions to data privacy; current solutions are limitedonly to static data release (ie; the entire dataset is assumed to be available at the time ofrelease). While this may be acceptable in some applications; today we see databasescontinuously growing everyday and even every hour. In such dynamic environments; thecurrent techniques may suffer from poor data quality and/or vulnerability to inference. In thispaper; we analyze various inference channels that may exist in multiple anonymizeddatasets and discuss how to avoid such inferences. We then present an approach tosecurely anonymizing a continuously growing dataset in an efficient manner while …,*,2006,215
Slicing: A New Approach for Privacy Preserving Data Publishing,Tiancheng Li; Ninghui Li; Jian Zhang; Ian Molloy,Several anonymization techniques; such as generalization and bucketization; have beendesigned for privacy preserving microdata publishing. Recent work has shown thatgeneralization loses considerable amount of information; especially for high-dimensionaldata. Bucketization; on the other hand; does not prevent membership disclosure and doesnot apply for data that do not have a clear separation between quasi-identifying attributesand sensitive attributes. In this paper; we present a novel technique called slicing; whichpartitions the data both horizontally and vertically. We show that slicing preserves better datautility than generalization and can be used for membership disclosure protection. Anotherimportant advantage of slicing is that it can handle high-dimensional data. We show howslicing can be used for attribute disclosure protection and develop an efficient algorithm …,Knowledge and Data Engineering; IEEE Transactions on,2012,214
On mutually exclusive roles and separation-of-duty,Ninghui Li; Mahesh V Tripunitara; Ziad Bizri,Abstract Separation-of-duty (SoD) is widely considered to be a fundamental principle incomputer security. A static SoD (SSoD) policy states that in order to have all permissionsnecessary to complete a sensitive task; the cooperation of at least a certain number of usersis required. Role-based access control (RBAC) is today's dominant access-control model. Itis widely believed that one of RBAC's main strengths is that it enables the use of constraintsto support policies; such as separation-of-duty. In the literature on RBAC; statically mutuallyexclusive roles (SMER) constraints are used to enforce SSoD policies. In this paper; weformulate and study fundamental computational problems related to the use of SMERconstraints to enforce SSoD policies. We show that directly enforcing SSoD policies isintractable (coNP-complete); while checking whether an RBAC state satisfies a set of …,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),2007,210
Automated trust negotiation using cryptographic credentials,Jiangtao Li; Ninghui Li; William H Winsborough,Abstract In automated trust negotiation (ATN); two parties exchange digitally signedcredentials that contain attribute information to establish trust and make access controldecisions. Because the information in question is often sensitive; credentials are protectedaccording to access control policies. In traditional ATN; credentials are transmitted either intheir entirety or not at all. This approach can at times fail unnecessarily; either because acyclic dependency makes neither negotiator willing to reveal her credential before heropponent; because the opponent must be authorized for all attributes packaged together ina credential to receive any of them; or because it is necessary to fully disclose exact attributevalues; rather than merely proving they satisfy some predicate (such as being over 21 yearsof age). Recently; several cryptographic credential schemes and associated protocols …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM conference on Computer and communications security,2005,192
Beyond proof-of-compliance: security analysis in trust management,Ninghui Li; John C Mitchell; William H Winsborough,Abstract Trust management is a form of distributed access control that allows one principal todelegate some access decisions to other principals. While the use of delegation greatlyenhances flexibility and scalability; it may also reduce the control that a principal has overthe resources it owns. Security analysis asks whether safety; availability; and otherproperties can be maintained while delegating to partially trusted principals. We show that incontrast to the undecidability of classical Harrison--Ruzzo--Ullman safety properties; ourprimary security properties are decidable. In particular; most security properties we study aredecidable in polynomial time. The computational complexity of containment analysis; themost complicated security property we study; varies according to the expressive power of thetrust management language.,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2005,183
Oblivious signature-based envelope,Ninghui Li; Wenliang Du; Dan Boneh,Abstract. We propose a new cryptographic primitive called oblivious signature-basedenvelope (OSBE). Informally; an OSBE scheme enables a sender to send an envelope(encrypted message) to a receiver; and has the following two properties:(1) The receiver canopen the envelope if and only if it has a third party's (eg; a certification authority's) signatureon an agreed-upon message.(2) The sender does not learn whether the receiver has thesignature or not. We show that OSBE can be used to break policy cycles in automated trustnegotiation (ATN) and to achieve oblivious access control. We develop a provably secureand efficient OSBE protocol for certificates signed using RSA signatures; as well as provablysecure and efficient one-round OSBE protocols for Rabin and BLS signatures from recentconstructions for identity-based encryption. We also present constructions for Generalized …,Distributed Computing,2005,182
Security analysis in role-based access control,Ninghui Li; Mahesh V Tripunitara,Abstract The administration of large role-based access control (RBAC) systems is achallenging problem. In order to administer such systems; decentralization of administrationtasks by the use of delegation is an effective approach. While the use of delegation greatlyenhances flexibility and scalability; it may reduce the control that an organization has over itsresources; thereby diminishing a major advantage RBAC has over discretionary accesscontrol (DAC). We propose to use security analysis techniques to maintain desirable securityproperties while delegating administrative privileges. We give a precise definition of a familyof security analysis problems in RBAC; which is more general than safety analysis that isstudied in the literature. We show that two classes of problems in the family can be reducedto similar analysis in the RT [&Larr;∩] role-based trust-management language; thereby …,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),2006,181
Safety in automated trust negotiation,William H Winsborough; Ninghui Li,Exchange of attribute credentials is a means to establish mutual trust between strangerswishing to share resources or conduct business transactions. Automated Trust Negotiation(ATN) is an approach to regulate the exchange of sensitive information during this process. Ittreats credentials as potentially sensitive resources; access to which is under policy control.Negotiations that correctly enforce policies have been called safe in the literature. Prior workon ATN lacks an adequate definition of this safety notion. In large part; this is becausefundamental questions such as what needs to be protected in ATN? and what are thesecurity requirements? are not adequately answered. As a result; many prior methods ofATN have serious security holes. We introduce a formal framework for ATN in which we giveprecise; usable; and intuitive definitions of correct enforcement of policies in ATN. We …,Security and Privacy; 2004.

Mining roles with semantic meanings,Ian Molloy; Hong Chen; Tiancheng Li; Qihua Wang; Ninghui Li; Elisa Bertino; Seraphin Calo; Jorge Lobo,Abstract With the growing adoption of role-based access control (RBAC) in commercialsecurity and identity management products; how to facilitate the process of migrating a non-RBAC system to an RBAC system has become a problem with significant business impact.Researchers have proposed to use data mining techniques to discover roles to complementthe costly top-down approaches for RBAC system construction. A key problem that has notbeen adequately addressed by existing role mining approaches is how to discover roleswith semantic meanings. In this paper; we study the problem in two settings with differentinformation availability. When the only information is user-permission relation; we propose todiscover roles whose semantic meaning is based on formal concept lattices. We argue thatthe theory of formal concept analysis provides a solid theoretical foundation for mining …,Proceedings of the 13th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2008,151
A practically implementable and tractable delegation logic,Ninghui Li; Benjamin Grosof; Joan Feigenbaum,We address the goal of making Delegation Logic (DL) into a practically implementable andtractable trust management system. DL (N. Li et al.; 1999) is a logic based knowledgerepresentation (ie; language) for authorization in large scale; open; distributed systems. DLinferencing is computationally intractable and highly impractical to implement. We introducea new version of Delegation Logic that remedies these difficulties. To achieve this; weimpose a syntactic restriction and redefine the semantics somewhat. We show that; for thisrevised version of DL; inferencing is computationally tractable under the same commonlymet restrictions for which Ordinary Logic Programs (OLP) inferencing is tractable (eg;Datalog and bounded number of logical variables per rule). We give an implementationarchitecture for this version of DL; it uses a delegation compiler from DL to OLP and can …,Security and Privacy; 2000. S&P 2000. Proceedings. 2000 IEEE Symposium on,2000,144
Closeness: A new privacy measure for data publishing,Ninghui Li; Tiancheng Li; Suresh Venkatasubramanian,The k-anonymity privacy requirement for publishing microdata requires that eachequivalence class (ie; a set of records that are indistinguishable from each other with respectto certain “identifying” attributes) contains at least k records. Recently; several authors haverecognized that k-anonymity cannot prevent attribute disclosure. The notion of ℓ-diversityhas been proposed to address this; ℓ-diversity requires that each equivalence class has atleast ℓ well-represented (in Section 2) values for each sensitive attribute. In this paper; weshow that ℓ-diversity has a number of limitations. In particular; it is neither necessary norsufficient to prevent attribute disclosure. Motivated by these limitations; we propose a newnotion of privacy called “closeness.” We first present the base model t-closeness; whichrequires that the distribution of a sensitive attribute in any equivalence class is close to …,Knowledge and Data Engineering; IEEE Transactions on,2010,143
A logic-based knowledge representation for authorization with delegation,Ninghui Li; Joan Feigenbaum; Benjamin N Grosof,We introduce Delegation Logic (DL); a logic-based knowledge representation (ie; language)that deals with authorization in large-scale; open distributed systems. Of central importancein any system for deciding whether requests should be authorized in such a system aredelegation of authority; negation of authority; and conflicts between authorities. DL'sapproach to these issues and to the interplay among them borrows from previous work ondelegation and trust management in the computer security literature and previous work onnegation and conflict handling in the logic programming and nonmonotonic reasoningliterature; but it departs from previous work in some crucial ways. We present the syntax andsemantics of DL and explain our novel design choices. We focus on delegation; includingexplicit treatment of delegation depth and delegation to complex principles.

Evaluating role mining algorithms,Ian Molloy; Ninghui Li; Tiancheng Li; Ziqing Mao; Qihua Wang; Jorge Lobo,Abstract While many role mining algorithms have been proposed in recent years; there lacksa comprehensive study to compare these algorithms. These role mining algorithms havebeen evaluated when they were proposed; but the evaluations were using different datasetsand evaluation criteria. In this paper; we introduce a comprehensive framework forevaluating role mining algorithms. We categorize role mining algorithms into two classesbased on their outputs; Class 1 algorithms output a sequence of prioritized roles while Class2 algorithms output complete RBAC states. We then develop techniques that enable us tocompare these algorithms directly. We also introduce a new role mining algorithm and twonew ways for algorithmically generating datasets for evaluation. Using synthetic as well asreal datasets; we compared nine role mining algorithms. Our results illustrate the …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2009,121
Towards formal verification of role-based access control policies,Somesh Jha; Ninghui Li; Mahesh Tripunitara; Qihua Wang; William Winsborough,Specifying and managing access control policies is a challenging problem. We propose todevelop formal verification techniques for access control policies to improve the current stateof the art of policy specification and management. In this paper; we formalize classes ofsecurity analysis problems in the context of role-based access control. We show that ingeneral these problems are PSPACE-complete. We also study the factors that contribute tothe computational complexity by considering a lattice of various subcases of the problemwith different restrictions. We show that several subcases remain PSPACE-complete;several further restricted subcases are NP-complete; and identify two subcases that aresolvable in polynomial time.

Protecting sensitive attributes in automated trust negotiation,William H Winsborough; Ninghui Li,Abstract Exchange of attribute credentials is a means to establish mutual trust betweenstrangers that wish to share resources or conduct business transactions. Automated TrustNegotiation (ATN) is an approach to regulate the flow of sensitive attributes during such anexchange. Recently; it has been noted that early ATN designs do not adequately protect theprivacy of negotiating parties. While unauthorized access to credentials can be denied;sensitive information about the attributes they carry may easily be inferred based on thebehavior of negotiators faithfully adhering to proposed negotiation procedure. Someproposals for correcting this problem do so by sacrificing the ability to effectively usesensitive credentials. We study an alternative design that avoids this pitfall by allowingnegotiators to define policy protecting the attribute itself; rather than the credentials that …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society,2002,118
Privbasis: frequent itemset mining with differential privacy,Ninghui Li; Wahbeh Qardaji; Dong Su; Jianneng Cao,Abstract The discovery of frequent itemsets can serve valuable economic and researchpurposes. Releasing discovered frequent itemsets; however; presents privacy challenges. Inthis paper; we study the problem of how to perform frequent itemset mining on transactiondatabases while satisfying differential privacy. We propose an approach; called PrivBasis;which leverages a novel notion called basis sets. A θ-basis set has the property that anyitemset with frequency higher than θ is a subset of some basis. We introduce algorithms forprivately constructing a basis set and then using it to find the most frequent itemsets.Experiments show that our approach greatly outperforms the current state of the art.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,108

Since one party may delegate partial control to another party; it is natural to askwhat permissions may be granted as the result of policy changes by other parties. We studysecurity properties such as safety; and availability for a family of trust managementlanguages; devising algorithms for deciding the possible consequences of certain changesin policy. While trust management is more powerful in certain ways than mechanisms in theaccess matrix model; and the security properties considered are more than simple safety; wefind that in contrast to the classical HRU undecidability of safety properties; our primarysecurity properties are decidable.

A critique of the ANSI standard on role-based access control,Ninghui Li; JiWon Byun; Elisa Bertino,In 2004; the American National Standards Institute approved the Role-Based Access Controlstandard to fulfill" a need among government and industry purchasers of informationtechnology products for a consistent and uniform definition of role based access control(RBAC) features". Such uniform definitions give IT product vendors and customers acommon and unambiguous terminology for RBAC features; which can lead to wideradoption of RBAC and increased productivity. However; the current ANSI RBAC Standardhas several limitations; design flaws; and technical errors that; it unaddressed; could lead toconfusions among IT product vendors and customers and to RBAC implementations withdifferent semantics; thus defeating the standard's purpose.,Security & Privacy; IEEE,2007,106
Access control policy combining: theory meets practice,Ninghui Li; Qihua Wang; Wahbeh Qardaji; Elisa Bertino; Prathima Rao; Jorge Lobo; Dan Lin,Abstract Many access control policy languages; eg; XACML; allow a policy to containmultiple sub-policies; and the result of the policy on a request is determined by combiningthe results of the sub-policies according to some policy combining algorithms (PCAs).Existing access control policy languages; however; do not provide a formal language forspecifying PCAs. As a result; it is difficult to extend them with new PCAs. While severalformal policy combining algebras have been proposed; they did not address importantpractical issues such as policy evaluation errors and obligations; furthermore; they cannotexpress PCAs that consider all sub-policies as a whole (eg; weak majority or strongmajority).

Administration in role-based access control,Ninghui Li; Ziqing Mao,Abstract Administration of large-scale RBAC systems is a challenging open problem. Wepropose a principled approach in designing and analyzing administrative models for RBAC.We identify six design requirements for administrative models of RBAC. These designrequirements are motivated by three principles for designing security mechanisms:(1)flexibility and scalability;(2) psychological acceptability; and (3) economy of mechanism. Wethen use these requirements to analyze several approaches to RBAC administration;including ARBAC97 [21; 23; 22]; SARBAC [4; 5]; and the RBAC system in the Oracle DBMS.Based on these requirements and the lessons learned in analyzing existing approaches; wedesign UARBAC; a new family of administrative models for RBAC that has significantadvantages over existing models.,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM symposium on Information; computer and communications security,2007,104

On the correctness criteria of fine-grained access control in relational databases,Qihua Wang; Ting Yu; Ninghui Li; Jorge Lobo; Elisa Bertino; Keith Irwin; Ji-Won Byun,Abstract Databases are increasingly being used to store information covered byheterogeneous policies; which require support for access control with great flexibility. Thishas led to increasing interest in using fine-grained access control; where different cells in arelation may be governed by different access control rules. Although several proposals havebeen made to support fine-grained access control; there currently does not exist a formalnotion of correctness regarding the query answering procedure. In this paper; we proposesuch a formal notion of correctness in fine-grained database access control; and discusswhy existing approaches fall short in some circumstances. We then propose a labelingapproach for masking unauthorized information and a query evaluation algorithm whichbetter supports fine-grained access control.

Satisfiability and resiliency in workflow authorization systems,Qihua Wang; Ninghui Li,Abstract We propose the role-and-relation-based access control (R 2 BAC) model forworkflow authorization systems. In R 2 BAC; in addition to a user's role memberships; theuser's relationships with other users help determine whether the user is allowed to perform acertain step in a workflow. For example; a constraint may require that two steps must not beperformed by users who have conflicts of interests. We study computational complexity of theworkflow satisfiability problem; which asks whether a set of users can complete a workflow.In particular; we apply tools from parameterized complexity theory to better understand thecomplexities of this problem. Furthermore; we reduce the workflow satisfiability problem toSAT and apply SAT solvers to address the problem. Experiments show that our algorithmcan solve instances of reasonable size efficiently.

OACerts: Oblivious attribute certificates,Jiangtao Li; Ninghui Li,We propose oblivious attribute certificates (OACerts); an attribute certificate scheme in whicha certificate holder can select which attributes to use and how to use them. In particular; auser can use attribute values stored in an OACert obliviously; ie; the user obtains a service ifand only if the attribute values satisfy the policy of the service provider; yet the serviceprovider learns nothing about these attribute values. This way; the service provider's accesscontrol policy is enforced in an oblivious fashion. To enable the oblivious access controlusing OACerts; we propose a new cryptographic primitive called oblivious commitment-based envelope (OCBE). In an OCBE scheme; Bob has an attribute value committed to Aliceand Alice runs a protocol with Bob to send an envelope (encrypted message) to Bob suchthat: 1) Bob can open the envelope if and only if his committed attribute value satisfies a …,Dependable and Secure Computing; IEEE Transactions on,2006,98
Universal accumulators with efficient nonmembership proofs,Jiangtao Li; Ninghui Li; Rui Xue,Abstract Based on the notion of accumulators; we propose a new cryptographic schemecalled universal accumulators. This scheme enables one to commit to a set of values using ashort accumulator and to efficiently compute a membership witness of any value that hasbeen accumulated. Unlike traditional accumulators; this scheme also enables one toefficiently compute a nonmembership witness of any value that has not been accumulated.We give a construction for universal accumulators and prove its security based on the strongRSA assumption. We further present a construction for dynamic universal accumulators; thisconstruction allows one to dynamically add and delete inputs with constant computationalcost. Our construction directly builds upon Camenisch and Lysyanskaya's dynamicaccumulator scheme. Universal accumulators can be seen as an extension to dynamic …,*,2007,97

Usable mandatory integrity protection for operating systems,Ninghui Li; Ziqing Mao; Hong Chen,Existing mandatory access control systems for operating systems are difficult to use. Weidentify several principles for designing usable access control systems and introduce theusable mandatory integrity protection (UMIP) model that adds usable mandatory accesscontrol to operating systems. The UMIP model is designed to preserve system integrity in theface of network-based attacks. The usability goals for UMIP are twofold. First; configuring aUMIP system should not be more difficult than installing and configuring an operatingsystem. Second; existing applications and common usage practices can still be used underUMIP. UMIP has several novel features to achieve these goals. For example; it introducesseveral concepts for expressing partial trust in programs. Furthermore; it leveragesinformation in the existing discretionary access control mechanism to derive file labels for …,Security and Privacy; 2007. SP'07. IEEE Symposium on,2007,95
An algebra for fine-grained integration of XACML policies,Prathima Rao; Dan Lin; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li; Jorge Lobo,Abstract Collaborative and distributed applications; such as dynamic coalitions andvirtualized grid computing; often require integrating access control policies of collaboratingparties. Such an integration must be able to support complex authorization specificationsand the fine-grained integration requirements that the various parties may have. In thispaper; we introduce an algebra for fine-grained integration of sophisticated policies. Thealgebra; which consists of three binary and two unary operations; is able to support thespecification of a large variety of integration constraints. To assess the expressive power ofour algebra; we introduce a notion of completeness and prove that our algebra is completewith respect to this notion. We then propose a framework that uses the algebra for the fine-grained integration of policies expressed in XACML. We also present a methodology for …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2009,94
Differentially Private Grids for Geospatial Data,Wahbeh Qardaji; Weining Yang; Ninghui Li,In this paper; we tackle the problem of constructing a differentially private synopsis for two-dimensional datasets such as geospatial datasets. The current state-of-the-art methods workby performing recursive binary partitioning of the data domains; and constructing a hierarchyof partitions. We show that the key challenge in partition-based synopsis methods lies inchoosing the right partition granularity to balance the noise error and the non-uniformityerror. We study the uniform-grid approach; which applies an equi-width grid of a certain sizeover the data domain and then issues independent count queries on the grid cells. Thismethod has received no attention in the literature; probably due to the fact that no goodmethod for choosing a grid size was known. Based on an analysis of the two kinds of errors;we propose a method for choosing the grid size. Experimental results validate our method …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1209.1322,2012,92
Minimizing private data disclosures in the smart grid,Weining Yang; Ninghui Li; Yuan Qi; Wahbeh Qardaji; Stephen McLaughlin; Patrick McDaniel,Abstract Smart electric meters pose a substantial threat to the privacy of individuals in theirown homes. Combined with non-intrusive load monitors; smart meter data can revealprecise home appliance usage information. An emerging solution to behavior leakage insmart meter measurement data is the use of battery-based load hiding. In this approach; abattery is used to store and supply power to home devices at strategic times to hideappliance loads from smart meters. A few such battery control algorithms have already beenstudied in the literature; but none have been evaluated from an adversarial point of view. Inthis paper; we first consider two well known battery privacy algorithms; Best Effort (BE) andNon-Intrusive Load Leveling (NILL); and demonstrate attacks that recover precise loadchange information; which can be used to recover appliance behavior information; under …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM conference on Computer and communications security,2012,88
Understanding SPKI/SDSI using first-order logic,Ninghui Li; John C Mitchell,Abstract SPKI/SDSI is a language for expressing distributed access control policy; derivedfrom SPKI and SDSI. We provide a first-order logic (FOL) semantics for SDSI; and show thatit has several advantages over previous semantics. For example; the FOL semantics iseasily extended to additional policy concepts and gives meaning to a larger class of accesscontrol and other policy analysis queries. We prove that the FOL semantics is equivalent tothe string rewriting semantics used by SDSI designers; for all queries associated with therewriting semantics. We also provide a FOL semantics for SPKI/SDSI and use it to analyzethe design of SPKI/SDSI. This reveals some problems. For example; the standard proofprocedure in RFC 2693 is semantically incomplete. In addition; as noted before by otherauthors; authorization tags in SPKI/SDSI are algorithmically problematic; making a …,International Journal of Information Security,2006,88
Provably private data anonymization: Or; k-anonymity meets differential privacy,Ninghui Li; Wahbeh H Qardaji; Dong Su,ABSTRACT Privacy-preserving microdata publishing currently lacks a solid theoreticalfoundation. Most existing techniques are developed to satisfy syntactic privacy notions suchas k-anonymity; which fails to provide strong privacy guarantees. The recently proposednotion of differential privacy has been widely accepted as a sound privacy foundation forstatistical query answering. However; no general practical microdata publishing techniquesare known to satisfy differential privacy. In this paper; we start to bridge this gap. We firstanalyze k-anonymization methods and show how they fail to provide sufficient protectionagainst re-identification; which it was designed to protect. We then prove that; k-anonymization methods; when done “safely”; and when preceded with a random samplingstep; can satisfy (ǫ; δ)-differential privacy with reasonable parameters. This result is; to …,CoRR; abs/1101.2604,2011,86
Injector: Mining background knowledge for data anonymization,Tiancheng Li; Ninghui Li,Existing work on privacy-preserving data publishing cannot satisfactorily prevent anadversary with background knowledge from learning important sensitive information. Themain challenge lies in modeling the adversary's background knowledge. We propose anovel approach to deal with such attacks. In this approach; one first mines knowledge fromthe data to be released and then uses the mining results as the background knowledgewhen anonymizing the data. The rationale of our approach is that if certain facts orbackground knowledge exist; they should manifest themselves in the data and we should beable to find them using data mining techniques. One intriguing aspect of our approach is thatone can argue that it improves both privacy and utility at the same time; as it both protectsagainst background knowledge attacks and better preserves the features in the data.

On sampling; anonymization; and differential privacy or; k-anonymization meets differential privacy,Ninghui Li; Wahbeh Qardaji; Dong Su,Abstract This paper aims at answering the following two questions in privacy-preservingdata analysis and publishing. The first is: What formal privacy guarantee (if any) does k-anonymization methods provide? k-Anonymization methods have been studied extensivelyin the database community; but have been known to lack strong privacy guarantees. Thesecond question is: How can we benefit from the adversary's uncertainty about the data?More specifically; can we come up a meaningful relaxation of differential privacy [2; 3] byexploiting the adversary's uncertainty about the dataset? We now discuss these twomotivations in more detail.,Proceedings of the 7th ACM Symposium on Information; Computer and Communications Security,2012,82
A formal semantics for P3P,Ting Yu; Ninghui Li; Annie I Antón,Abstract The Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P); developed by the W3C; provides anXML-based language for websites to encode their data-collection and data-use practices ina machine-readable form. To fully deploy P3P in enterprise information systems and overthe Web; a well-defined semantics for P3P policies is a must; which is lacking in the currentP3P framework. Without a formal semantics; a P3P policy may be semantically inconsistentand may be interpreted and represented differently by different user agents; it is difficult todetermine whether a P3P policy is indeed enforced by an enterprise; and privacy policiesfrom different corporations cannot be formally compared before information exchange. In thispaper; we propose a relational formal semantics for P3P policies; which precisely andintuitively models the relationships between different components of P3P statements (ie …,Proceedings of the 2004 workshop on Secure web service,2004,76
Defeating cross-site request forgery attacks with browser-enforced authenticity protection,Ziqing Mao; Ninghui Li; Ian Molloy,Abstract A cross site request forgery (CSRF) attack occurs when a user's web browser isinstructed by a malicious webpage to send a request to a vulnerable web site; resulting inthe vulnerable web site performing actions not intended by the user. CSRF vulnerabilitiesare very common; and consequences of such attacks are most serious with financialwebsites. We recognize that CSRF attacks are an example of the confused deputy problem;in which the browser is viewed by websites as the deputy of the user; but may be tricked intosending requests that violate the user's intention. We propose Browser-Enforced AuthenticityProtection (BEAP); a browser-based mechanism to defend against CSRF attacks. BEAPinfers whether a request reflects the user's intention and whether an authentication token issensitive; and strips sensitive authentication tokens from any request that may not reflect …,*,2009,75
Local names in SPKI/SDSI,Ninghui Li,We analyze the notion of" local names" in SPKI/SDSI. By interpreting local names asdistributed groups; we develop a simple logic program for SPKI/SDSI's linked local-namescheme and prove that it is equivalent to the name-resolution procedure in SDSI 1.1 and the4-tuple-reduction mechanism in SPKI/SDSI 2.0. This logic program is itself a logic forunderstanding SDSI's linked local-name scheme and has several advantages over previouslogics. We then enhance our logic program to handle authorization certificates; thresholdsubjects; and certificate discovery. This enhanced program serves both as a logicalcharacterization and an implementation of SPKI/SDSI 2.0's certificate reduction anddiscovery. We discuss the way SPKI/SDSI uses the threshold subjects and names for thepurpose of authorization and show that; when used in a certain restricted way; local …,Computer Security Foundations Workshop; 2000.

Security analysis in role-based access control,Ninghui Li; Mahesh V Tripunitara,Abstract Delegation is often used in administrative models for Role-Based Access Control(RBAC) systems to decentralize administration tasks. While the use of delegation greatlyenhances flexibility and scalability; it may reduce the control that an organization has over itsresources; thereby diminishing a major advantage RBAC has over Discretionary AccessControl (DAC). We propose to use security analysis techniques to maintain desirablesecurity properties while delegating administrative privileges. We give a precise definition ofa family of security analysis problems in RBAC; which is more general than safety analysisthat is studied in the literature. We also show that two classes of problems in the family canbe reduced to similar analysis in the RT 0 trust-management language; thereby establishingan interesting relationship between RBAC and the RT (Role-based Trust-management) …,Proceedings of the ninth ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2004,74
Modeling and integrating background knowledge in data anonymization,Tiancheng Li; Ninghui Li; Jian Zhang,Recent work has shown the importance of considering the adversary's backgroundknowledge when reasoning about privacy in data publishing. However; it is very difficult forthe data publisher to know exactly the adversary's background knowledge. Existing workcannot satisfactorily model background knowledge and reason about privacy in thepresence of such knowledge. This paper presents a general framework for modeling theadversary's background knowledge using kernel estimation methods. This frameworksubsumes different types of knowledge (eg; negative association rules) that can be minedfrom the data. Under this framework; we reason about privacy using Bayesian inferencetechniques and propose the skyline (B; t)-privacy model; which allows the data publisher toenforce privacy requirements to protect the data against adversaries with different levels …,Data Engineering; 2009.

Beyond separation of duty: An algebra for specifying high-level security policies,Ninghui Li; Qihua Wang,Abstract The process of introducing security controls into a sensitive task; which we callsecure task design in this article; consists of two steps: high-level security policy design andlow-level enforcement scheme design. A high-level security policy states an overallrequirement for a sensitive task. One example of a high-level security policy is a separationof duty policy; which requires a task to be performed by a team of at least k users. Unlike low-level enforcement schemes such as security constraints in workflows; a separation of dutypolicy states a high-level requirement about the task without referring to individual steps inthe task. While extremely important and widely used; separation of duty policies state onlyrequirements on the number of users involved in the task and do not capture therequirements on these users' attributes.

Mining roles with multiple objectives,Ian Molloy; Hong Chen; Tiancheng Li; Qihua Wang; Ninghui Li; Elisa Bertino; Seraphin Calo; Jorge Lobo,Abstract With the growing adoption of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in commercialsecurity and identity management products; how to facilitate the process of migrating a non-RBAC system to an RBAC system has become a problem with significant business impact.Researchers have proposed to use data mining techniques to discover roles to complementthe costly top-down approaches for RBAC system construction. An important problem is howto construct RBAC systems with low complexity. In this article; we define the notion ofweighted structural complexity measure and propose a role mining algorithm that minesRBAC systems with low structural complexity. Another key problem that has not beenadequately addressed by existing role mining approaches is how to discover roles withsemantic meanings.

EXAM: a comprehensive environment for the analysis of access control policies,Dan Lin; Prathima Rao; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li; Jorge Lobo,Abstract Policy integration and inter-operation is often a crucial requirement when partieswith different access control policies need to participate in collaborative applications andcoalitions. Such requirement is even more difficult to address for dynamic large-scalecollaborations; in which the number of access control policies to analyze and compare canbe quite large. An important step in policy integration and inter-operation is to analyze thesimilarity of policies. Policy similarity can sometimes also be a pre-condition for establishinga collaboration; in that a party may enter a collaboration with another party only if thepolicies enforced by the other party match or are very close to its own policies. Existingapproaches to the problem of analyzing and comparing access control policies are verylimited; in that they only deal with some special cases.

Towards optimal< i> k</i>-anonymization,Tiancheng Li; Ninghui Li,Abstract When releasing microdata for research purposes; one needs to preserve theprivacy of respondents while maximizing data utility. An approach that has been studiedextensively in recent years is to use anonymization techniques such as generalization andsuppression to ensure that the released data table satisfies the k-anonymity property. Amajor thread of research in this area aims at developing more flexible generalizationschemes and more efficient searching algorithms to find better anonymizations (ie; thosethat have less information loss). This paper presents three new generalization schemes thatare more flexible than existing schemes. This flexibility can lead to better anonymizations.We present a taxonomy of generalization schemes and discuss their relationship.

Comparing the expressive power of access control models,Mahesh V Tripunitara; Ninghui Li,Abstract Comparing the expressive power of access control models is recognized as afundamental problem in computer security. Such comparisons are generally based onsimulations between different access control schemes. However; the definitions forsimulations that are used in the literature make it impossible to put results and claims aboutthe expressive power of access control models into a single context and to compare suchmodels to one another in a meaningful way. We propose a theory for comparing theexpressive power of access control models. We perceive access control systems as state-transition systems and require simulations to preserve security properties. We discuss therationale behind such a theory; apply the theory to reexamine some existing work on theexpressive power of access control models in the literature and present three results.

Minimizing minimality and maximizing utility: analyzing method-based attacks on anonymized data,Graham Cormode; Divesh Srivastava; Ninghui Li; Tiancheng Li,Abstract The principle of anonymization for data sharing has become a very popularparadigm for the preservation of privacy of the data subjects. Since the introduction of k-anonymity; dozens of methods and enhanced privacy definitions have been proposed.However; over-eager attempts to minimize the information lost by the anonymizationpotentially allow private information to be inferred. Proof-of-concept of this" minimality attack"has been demonstrated for a variety of algorithms and definitions [16]. In this paper; weprovide a comprehensive analysis and study of this attack; and demonstrate that with care itseffect can be almost entirely countered. The attack allows an adversary to increase his(probabilistic) belief in certain facts about individuals over the data.

Achieving privacy in mesh networks,Xiaoxin Wu; Ninghui Li,Abstract Mesh network is vulnerable to privacy attacks because of the open mediumproperty of wireless channel; the fixed topology; and the limited network size. Traditionalanonymous routing algorithm cannot be directly applied to Mesh network; because they donot defend global attackers. In this paper we design private routing algorithm that used"Onion"; ie; layered encryption; to hide routing information. In addition; we explore specialring topology that fits the investigated network scenario; to preserve a certain level of privacyagainst a global adversary.,Proceedings of the fourth ACM workshop on Security of ad hoc and sensor networks,2006,59
Oacerts: Oblivious attribute certificates,Jiangtao Li; Ninghui Li,Abstract We propose Oblivious Attribute Certificates (OACerts); an attribute certificatescheme in which a certificate holder can select which attributes to use and how to use them.In particular; a user can use attribute values stored in an OACert obliviously; ie; the userobtains a service if and only if the attribute values satisfy the policy of the service provider;yet the service provider learns nothing about these attribute values. This way; the serviceprovider's access control policy is enforced in an oblivious fashion. To enable the obliviousaccess control using OACerts; we propose a new cryptographic primitive called ObliviousCommitment-Based Envelope (OCBE). In an OCBE scheme; Bob has an attribute valuecommitted to Alice and Alice runs a protocol with Bob to send an envelope (encryptedmessage) to Bob such that:(1) Bob can open the envelope if and only if his committed …,*,2005,59
Safety in automated trust negotiation,William H Winsborough; Ninghui Li,Abstract Exchange of attribute credentials is a means to establish mutual trust betweenstrangers wishing to share resources or conduct business transactions. Automated TrustNegotiation (ATN) is an approach to regulate the exchange of sensitive information duringthis process. It treats credentials as potentially sensitive resources; access to which is underpolicy control. Negotiations that correctly enforce policies have been called “safe” in theliterature. Prior work on ATN lacks an adequate definition of this safety notion. In large part;this is because fundamental questions such as “what needs to be protected in ATN?” and“what are the security requirements?” are not adequately answered. As a result; many priormethods of ATN have serious security holes. We introduce a formal framework for ATN inwhich we give precise; usable; and intuitive definitions of correct enforcement of policies …,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),2006,55
Mining roles with noisy data,Ian Molloy; Ninghui Li; Yuan Alan Qi; Jorge Lobo; Luke Dickens,Abstract There has been increasing interest in automatic techniques for generating roles forrole based access control; a process known as role mining. Most role mining approachesassume the input data is clean; and attempt to optimize the RBAC state. We examine rolemining with noisy input data and suggest dividing the problem into two steps: noise removaland candidate role generation. We introduce an approach to use (non-binary) rank reducedmatrix factorization to identify noise and experimentally show that it is effective at identifyingnoise in access control data. User-and permission-attributes can further be used to improveaccuracy. Next; we show that our two-step approach is able to find candidate roles that areclose to the roles mined from noise-less data. This method performs better than theapproach of mining noisy data directly and offering the administrator increased control in …,Proceedings of the 15th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2010,49

In this paper we propose an approach toanalyze and compare the quality of protection offered by these different MAC systems. Weintroduce the notion of vulnerability surfaces under attack scenarios as the measurement ofprotection quality; and implement a tool called VulSAN for computing such vulnerabilitysurfaces. In VulSAN; we encode security policies; system states; and system rules usinglogic programs. Given an attack scenario; VulSAN computes a host attack graph and thevulnerability surface.

On safety in discretionary access control,Ninghui Li; Mahesh V Tripunitara,An apparently prevailing myth is that safety is undecidable in discretionary access control(DAC); therefore; one needs to invent new DAC schemes in which safety analysis isdecidable. In this paper we dispel this myth. We argue that DAC should not be equated withthe Harrison-Ruzzo-Ullman (1976) access matrix scheme; in which safety is undecidable.We present an efficient (running time cubic in its input size) algorithm for deciding safety inthe Graham-Denning (1972) DAC scheme; which subsumes the DAC schemes used in theliterature on comparing DAC with other access control models. We also counter severalclaims made in recent work by Solworth and Sloan (2004); in which the authors present anew access control scheme based on labels and relabelling and assert that it can implementthe full range of DAC models.

On the (in) security and (im) practicality of outsourcing precise association rule mining,Ian Molloy; Ninghui Li; Tiancheng Li,The recent interest in outsourcing IT services onto the cloud raises two main concerns:security and cost. One task that could be outsourced is data mining. In VLDB 2007; Wong etal. propose an approach for outsourcing association rule mining. Their approach maps a setof real items into a set of pseudo items; then maps each transaction non-deterministically.This paper; analyzes both the security and costs associated with outsourcing associationrule mining. We show how to break the encoding scheme from Wong et al. without usingcontext specific information and reduce the security to a one-to-one mapping. We present astricter notion of security than used by Wong et al.; and then consider the practicality ofoutsourcing association rule mining. Our results indicate that outsourcing association rulemining may not be practical; if the data owner is concerned with data confidentiality.,Data Mining; 2009. ICDM'09.

Resiliency policies in access control,Ninghui Li; Qihua Wang; Mahesh Tripunitara,Abstract We introduce the notion of resiliency policies in the context of access controlsystems. Such policies require an access control system to be resilient to the absence ofusers. An example resiliency policy requires that upon removal of any s users; there shouldstill exist d disjoint sets of users such that the users in each set together possess certainpermissions of interest. Such a policy ensures that even when emergency situations causesome users to be absent; there still exist independent teams of users that have thepermissions necessary for carrying out critical tasks. The Resiliency Checking Problemdetermines whether an access control state satisfies a given resiliency policy. We show thatthe general case of the problem and several subcases are intractable (NP-hard); andidentify two subcases that are solvable in linear time.

Privacy-preserving incremental data dissemination,Ji-Won Byun; Tiancheng Li; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li; Yonglak Sohn,Abstract Although the k-anonymity and ℓ-diversity models have led to a number of valuableprivacy-protecting techniques and algorithms; the existing solutions are currently limited tostatic data release. That is; it is assumed that a complete dataset is available at the time ofdata release. This assumption implies a significant shortcoming; as in many applicationsdata collection is rather a continual process. Moreover; the assumption entails “one-time”data dissemination; thus; it does not adequately address today's strong demand forimmediate and up-to-date information. In this paper; we consider incremental datadissemination; where a dataset is continuously incremented with new data. The key issuehere is that the same data may be anonymized and published multiple times; each of thetime in a different form. Thus; static anonymization (ie; anonymization which does not …,Journal of Computer Security,2009,47
Policy decomposition for collaborative access control,Dan Lin; Prathima Rao; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li; Jorge Lobo,Abstract With the advances in web service techniques; new collaborative applications haveemerged like supply chain arrangements and coalition in government agencies. In suchapplications; the collaborating parties are responsible for managing and protectingresources entrusted to them. Access control decisions thus become a collaborative activity inwhich a global policy must be enforced by a set of collaborating parties withoutcompromising the autonomy or confidentiality requirements of these parties. Unfortunately;none of the conventional access control systems meets these new requirements. To supportcollaborative access control; in this paper; we propose a novel policy-based access controlmodel. Our main idea is based on the notion of policy decomposition and we propose anextension to the reference architecture for XACML.

We perceive accesscontrol systems as state-transition systems and present two kinds of simulations; reductionsand state-matching reductions. In applying the theory; we highlight four new results anddiscuss these results in the context of other results that can be inferred or are known. Oneresult indicates that the access matrix scheme due to Harrison; Ruzzo and Ullman is limitedin its expressive power when compared with a trust-management scheme; thereby formallyestablishing a conjecture from the literature. A second result is that a particular RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) scheme; ARBAC97; may be limited in its expressive power; therebycountering claims in the literature that RBAC is more expressive than DAC (Discretionary …,Journal of Computer Security,2007,42
Satisfiability and resiliency in workflow systems,Qihua Wang; Ninghui Li,Abstract We propose the role-and-relation-based access control (R 2 BAC) model forworkflow systems. In R 2 BAC; in addition to a user's role memberships; the user'srelationships with other users help determine whether the user is allowed to perform acertain step in a workflow. For example; a constraint may require that two steps must not beperformed by users who have a conflict of interest. We also study the workflow satisfiabilityproblem; which asks whether a set of users can complete a workflow. We show that theproblem is NP-complete for R 2 BAC; and is NP-complete for any workflow model thatsupports certain simple types of constraints (eg; constraints that state certain two steps mustbe performed by two different users). After that; we apply tools from parameterizedcomplexity theory to better understand the complexities of this problem. We show that the …,*,2007,42
Policy-hiding access control in open environment,Jiangtao Li; Ninghui Li,Abstract In trust management and attribute-based access control systems; access controldecisions are based on the attributes (rather than the identity) of the requester: Access isgranted if Alice's attributes in her certificates satisfy Bob's access control policy. In this paper;we develop a policy-hiding access control scheme that protects both sensitive attributes andsensitive policies. That is; Bob can decide whether Alice's certified attribute values satisfyBob's policy; without Bob learning any other information about Alice's attribute values orAlice learning Bob's policy. To enable policy-hiding access control; we introduce the notionof certified input private policy evaluation.

Automated trust negotiation using cryptographic credentials,Jiangtao Li; Ninghui Li; William H Winsborough,Abstract In automated trust negotiation (ATN); two parties exchange digitally signedcredentials that contain attribute information to establish trust and make access controldecisions. Because the information in question is often sensitive; credentials are protectedaccording to access control policies. In traditional ATN; credentials are transmitted either intheir entirety or not at all. This approach can at times fail unnecessarily; either because acyclic dependency makes neither negotiator willing to reveal her credential before heropponent because the opponent must be authorized for all attributes packaged together in acredential to receive any of them; or because it is necessary to disclose the precise attributevalues; rather than merely proving they satisfy some predicate (such as being over 21 yearsof age). Recently; several cryptographic credential schemes and associated protocols …,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),2009,33
Optimal k-anonymity with flexible generalization schemes through bottom-up searching,Tiancheng Li; Ninghui Li,In recent years; a major thread of research on k-anonymity has focused on developing moreflexible generalization schemes that produce higher-quality datasets. In this paper weintroduce three new generalization schemes that improve on existing schemes; as well asalgorithms enumerating valid generalizations in these schemes. We also introduce ataxonomy for generalization schemes and a new cost metric for measuring information loss.We present a bottom-up search strategy for finding optimal anonymizations. This strategyworks particularly well when the value of k is small. We show the feasibility of our approachthrough experiments on real census data,Data Mining Workshops; 2006. ICDM Workshops 2006.

Constraint generation for separation of duty,Hong Chen; Ninghui Li,Abstract Separation of Duty (SoD) is widely recognized to be a fundamental principle incomputer security. A Static SoD (SSoD) policy states that in order to have all permissionsnecessary to complete a sensitive task; the cooperation of at least a certain number of usersis required. In Role-Based Access Control (RBAC); Statically Mutually Exclusive Role(SMER) constraints are used to enforce SSoD policies. This paper studies the problem ofgenerating sets of constraints that (a) enforce a set of SSoD policies;(b) are compatible withthe existing role hierarchy; and (c) are minimal in the sense that there is no other constraintset that is less restrictive and satisfies (a) and (b).,Proceedings of the eleventh ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2006,31
Nonmonotonicity; user interfaces; and risk assessment in certificate revocation,Ninghui Li; Joan Feigenbaum,Abstract We consider certificate revocation from three high-level perspectives: temporalnonmonotonicity; user interfaces; and risk management. We argue that flawedunderstanding of these three aspects of revocation schemes has caused these schemes tobe unnecessarily costly; complex; and confusing. We also comment briefly on someprevious works; including those of Rivest [16]; Fox and LaMacchia [5]; and McDaniel andRubin [11].,*,2002,31
Trojan horse resistant discretionary access control,Ziqing Mao; Ninghui Li; Hong Chen; Xuxian Jiang,Abstract Modern operating systems primarily use Discretionary Access Control (DAC) toprotect files and other operating system resources. DAC mechanisms are more user-friendlythan Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems; but are vulnerable to attacks that use trojanhorses or exploit buggy software. We show that it is possible to have the best of both worlds:DAC's easy-to-use discretionary policy and MAC's defense against trojan horses and buggyprograms. This is made possible by a key new insight that DAC has weaknesses notbecause it uses the discretionary principle; but because existing DAC enforcementmechanisms assume that a single principal is responsible for any request; whereas in realitya request may be influenced by multiple principals; thus these mechanisms cannot correctlyidentify the true origin (s) of a request and fall prey to trojan horses. We propose to solve …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2009,30
Fine-grained integration of access control policies,Prathima Rao; Dan Lin; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li; Jorge Lobo,Abstract Collaborative and distributed applications; such as dynamic coalitions andvirtualized grid computing; often require integrating access control policies of collaboratingparties. Such an integration must be able to support complex authorization specificationsand the fine-grained integration requirements that the various parties may have. In thispaper; we introduce an algebra for fine-grained integration of sophisticated policies. Thealgebra; which consists of three binary and two unary operations; is able to support thespecification of a large variety of integration constraints. For ease of use; we also introduce aset of derived operators and provide guidelines for users to edit a policy with desiredproperties. To assess the expressive power of our algebra; we define notion ofcompleteness and prove that our algebra is complete and minimal with respect to the …,Computers & Security,2011,29
On practical specification and enforcement of obligations,Ninghui Li; Haining Chen; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Obligations are an important and indispensable part of many access controlpolicies; such as those in DRM (Digital Rights Management) and healthcare informationsystems. To be able use obligations in a real-world access control system; there must exist alanguage for specifying obligations. However; such a language is currently lacking. XACML(eXtensible Access Control Markup Language); the current de facto standard for specifyingaccess control policies; seems to integrate obligations as a part of it; but it treats obligationslargely as black boxes; without specifying what an obligation should include and how tohandle them. In this paper we examine the challenges in designing a practical approach forspecifying and handling obligations; and then propose a language for specifyingobligations; and an architecture for handling access control policies with these …,Proceedings of the second ACM conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy,2012,28
On the complexity of authorization in RBAC under qualification and security constraints,Yuqing Sun; Qihua Wang; Ninghui Li; Elisa Bertino; Mikhail J Atallah,In practice; assigning access permissions to users must satisfy a variety of constraintsmotivated by business and security requirements. Here; we focus on Role-Based AccessControl (RBAC) systems; in which access permissions are assigned to roles and roles arethen assigned to users. User-role assignment is subject to role-based constraints; such asmutual exclusion constraints; prerequisite constraints; and role-cardinality constraints. Also;whether a user is qualified for a role depends on whether his/her qualification satisfies therole's requirements. In other words; a role can only be assigned to a certain set of qualifiedusers. In this paper; we study fundamental problems related to access control constraintsand user-role assignment; such as determining whether there are conflicts in a set ofconstraints; verifying whether a user-role assignment satisfies all constraints; and how to …,Dependable and Secure Computing; IEEE Transactions on,2011,28
On the security of delegation in access control systems,Qihua Wang; Ninghui Li; Hong Chen,Abstract Delegation is a mechanism that allows a user A to act on another user B's behalf bymaking B's access rights available to A. It is well recognized as an important mechanism toprovide resiliency and flexibility in access control systems; and has gained popularity in theresearch community. However; most existing literature focuses on modeling and managingdelegations. Little work has been done on understanding the impact of delegation on thesecurity of existing access control systems. In particular; no formal notion of security withrespect to delegation has been proposed. Many existing access control systems aredesigned without having delegation in mind. Simply incorporating a delegation module intothose systems may cause security breaches. This paper focuses on the security aspect ofdelegation in access control systems. We first give examples on how colluding users may …,*,2008,28
An efficient framework for user authorization queries in RBAC systems,Guneshi T Wickramaarachchi; Wahbeh H Qardaji; Ninghui Li,Abstract The User Authorization Query (UAQ) Problem for RBAC; introduced by Zhang andJoshi; is to determine the set of roles to be activated in a single session for a particular set ofpermissions requested by the user. This set of roles must satisfy constraints that preventcertain combinations of roles to be activated in one session; and should follow the leastprivilege principle. We show that the existing approach to the UAQ problem is inadequate;and propose two approaches for solving the UAQ problem. In the first approach; we developalgorithms that use the backtracking-based search techniques developed in the artificialintelligence community. In the second approach; we reduce the problem to the MAXSATproblem which can be solved using available SAT solvers. We have implemented bothapproaches and experimentally evaluated them.,Proceedings of the 14th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2009,27
Dynamic virtual credit card numbers,Ian Molloy; Jiangtao Li; Ninghui Li,Abstract Theft of stored credit card information is an increasing threat to e-commerce. Wepropose a dynamic virtual credit card number scheme that reduces the damage caused bystolen credit card numbers. A user can use an existing credit card account to generatemultiple virtual credit card numbers that are either usable for a single transaction or are tiedwith a particular merchant. We call the scheme dynamic because the virtual credit cardnumbers can be generated without online contact with the credit card issuers. Thesenumbers can be processed without changing any of the infrastructure currently in place; theonly changes will be at the end points; namely; the card users and the card issuers. Weanalyze the security requirements for dynamic virtual credit card numbers; discuss thedesign space; propose a scheme using HMAC; and prove its security under the …,*,2007,27
A semantics based approach to privacy languages,Ninghui Li; Ting Yu; A Anton,Abstract A key reason for the slow adoption of the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) isthe lack of a formal semantics. Without a formal semantics; a P3P policy may be semanticallyinconsistent and may be interpreted and represented differently by different user agents. Inthis paper; we redress these problems by proposing a relational formal semantics for P3Ppolicies; which precisely models the relationships between different components of P3Pstatements (ie; collected data items; purposes; recipients and retentions) during onlineinformation collection. Based on this semantics; we present SemPref; a simple; efficient andexpressive semantics-based preference language. Unlike previously proposed preferencelanguages; SemPref queries the meaning of a privacy policy rather than its syntacticrepresentation. The proposed formal semantics and preference language are an …,Computer Systems Science and Engineering,2006,27

Efficient and accurate strategies for differentially-private sliding window queries,Jianneng Cao; Qian Xiao; Gabriel Ghinita; Ninghui Li; Elisa Bertino; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Regularly releasing the aggregate statistics about data streams in a privacy-preserving way not only serves valuable commercial and social purposes; but also protectsthe privacy of individuals. This problem has already been studied under differential privacy;but only for the case of a single continuous query that covers the entire time span; eg;counting the number of tuples seen so far in the stream. However; most real-worldapplications are window-based; that is; they are interested in the statistical information aboutstreaming data within a window; instead of the whole unbound stream. Furthermore; a DataStream Management System (DSMS) may need to answer numerous correlated aggregatedqueries simultaneously; rather than a single one. To cope with these requirements; we studyhow to release differentially private answers for a set of sliding window aggregate queries …,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,25
A Framework for Role-Based Access Control in Group Communication Systems.,Cristina Nita-Rotaru; Ninghui Li,Abstract—In addition to basic security services such as data confidentiality; integrity andsource authentication; a secure group communication system should also provideauthentication of participants and access control to group resources. While considerableresearch has been conducted on providing data confidentiality and integrity for groupcommunication systems; less work focused on group access control services. Majorchallenges in this aspect are reconciling flexibility with scalability; and enforcing accesscontrol in the context of dynamic and distributed groups while supporting process failuresand network partitions. In this paper we analyze the requirements access controlmechanisms must fulfill in the context of group communication systems and define aframework for supporting fine-grained access control in client-server group …,ISCA PDCS,2004,24
Denial of service attacks and defenses in decentralized trust management,Jiangtao Li; Ninghui Li; XiaoFeng Wang; Ting Yu,Abstract Trust management is an approach to scalable and flexible access control indecentralized systems. In trust management; a server often needs to evaluate a chain ofcredentials submitted by a client; this requires the server to perform multiple expensivedigital signature verifications. In this paper; we study low-bandwidth Denial-of-Service (DoS)attacks that exploit the existence of trust management systems to deplete server resources.Although the threat of DoS attacks has been studied for some application-level protocolssuch as authentication protocols; we show that it is especially destructive for trustmanagement systems. Exploiting the delegation feature in trust management languages; anattacker can forge a long credential chain to force a server to consume a large amount ofcomputing resource. Using game theory as an analytic tool; we demonstrate that …,International journal of Information security,2009,23
Access control friendly query verification for outsourced data publishing,Hong Chen; Xiaonan Ma; Windsor Hsu; Ninghui Li; Qihua Wang,Abstract Outsourced data publishing is a promising approach to achieve higher distributionefficiency; greater data survivability; and lower management cost. In outsourced datapublishing (sometimes referred to as third-party publishing); a data owner gives the contentof databases to multiple publishers which answer queries sent by clients. In many cases; thetrustworthiness of the publishers cannot be guaranteed; therefore; it is important for a clientto be able to verify the correctness of the query results. Meanwhile; due to privacy concerns;it is also required that such verification does not expose information that is outside a client'saccess control area. Current approaches for verifying the correctness of query results in third-party publishing either do not consider the privacy preserving requirement; or are limited toone dimensional queries. In this paper; we introduce a new scheme for verifying the …,*,2008,23
Nonparametric Bayesian matrix factorization by Power-EP,Nan Ding; Rongjing Xiang; Ian Molloy; Ninghui Li,Abstract Many real-world applications can be modeled by matrix factorization. Byapproximating an observed data matrix as the product of two latent matrices; matrixfactorization can reveal hidden structures embedded in data. A common challenge to usematrix factorization is determining the dimensionality of the latent matrices from data. IndianBuffet Processes (IBPs) enable us to apply the nonparametric Bayesian machinery toaddress this challenge. However; it remains a difficult task to learn nonparametric Bayesianmatrix factorization models. In this paper; we propose a novel variational Bayesian methodbased on new equivalence classes of infinite matrices for learning these models.Furthermore; inspired by the success of nonnegative matrix factorization on many learningproblems; we impose nonnegativity constraints on the latent matrices and mix variational …,International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics,2010,21
PRECIP: Towards Practical and Retrofittable Confidential Information Protection.,XiaoFeng Wang; Zhuowei Li; Ninghui Li; Jong Youl Choi,Abstract A grand challenge in information protection is how to preserve the confidentiality ofsensitive information under spyware surveillance. This problem has not been welladdressed by the existing access-control mechanisms which cannot prevent the spywarealready in a system from monitoring an authorized party's interactions with sensitive data.Our answer to this challenge is PRECIP; a new security policy model which takes a first steptowards practical and retrofittable confidential information protection. This model is designedto offer efficient online protection for commercial applications and operating systems. Itintends to be retrofitted to these applications and systems without modifying their code. Tothis end; PRECIP addresses several practical issues critical to containing spywaresurveillance; which however are not well handled by the previous work in access control …,NDSS,2008,21
Combining discretionary policy with mandatory information flow in operating systems,Ziqing Mao; Ninghui Li; Hong Chen; Xuxian Jiang,Abstract Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is the primary access control mechanism intoday's major operating systems. It is; however; vulnerable to Trojan Horse attacks andattacks exploiting buggy software. We propose to combine the discretionary policy in DACwith the dynamic information flow techniques in MAC; therefore achieving the best of bothworlds; that is; the DAC's easy-to-use discretionary policy specification and MAC's defenseagainst threats caused by Trojan Horses and buggy programs. We propose the InformationFlow Enhanced Discretionary Access Control (IFEDAC) model that implements this designphilosophy. We describe our design of IFEDAC; and discuss its relationship with the UsableMandatory Integrity Protection (UMIP) model proposed earlier by us. In addition; we analyzetheir security property and their relationships with other protection systems. We also …,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),2011,17
The Foundational work of Harrison-Ruzzo-Ullman Revisited,M Tripunitara; Ninghui Li,The work by Harrison; Ruzzo; and Ullman (the HRU paper) on safety in the context of theaccess matrix model is widely considered to be foundational work in access control. In thispaper; we address two errors we have discovered in the HRU paper. To our knowledge;these errors have not been previously reported in the literature. The first error regards aproof that shows that safety analysis for mono-operational HRU systems is in NP. The errorstems from a faulty assumption that such systems are monotonic for the purpose of safetyanalysis. We present a corrected proof in this paper. The second error regards a mappingfrom one version of the safety problem to another that is presented in the HRU paper. Wedemonstrate that the mapping is not a reduction; and present a reduction that enables us toinfer that the second version of safety introduced in the HRU paper is also undecidable …,*,2013,16
Securing Java RMI-based distributed applications,Ninghui Li; John C Mitchell; Derrick Tong,Both Java RMI and Jini use a proxy-based architecture. In this architecture; a client interactswith a service through a proxy; which is code downloaded from a directory and installed onthe client's machine. An attacker who controls the communication channels or the directorymay compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the client and of the service. We presenta security architecture that protects both clients and services in distributed proxy-basedcomputing. In this architecture; the service registers a signed authentication proxy with thedirectory. The client; after downloading a signed authentication proxy from the directory;verifies the signature on the proxy; authenticates itself to the service through the proxy; andreceives a dedicated session proxy for the service over a secure channel. We also describea Java-based toolkit that implements the security architecture. This toolkit enables …,Computer Security Applications Conference; 2004. 20th Annual,2004,16
Distributed credential chain discovery in trust management with parameterized roles and constraints (short paper),Ziqing Mao; Ninghui Li; William H Winsborough,Abstract Trust management (TM) is an approach to access control in decentralizeddistributed systems with access control decisions based on statements made by multipleprincipals. Li et al. developed the RT family of Role-Based Trust-management languages;which combine the strengths of Role-Based Access Control and TM systems. We present adistributed credential chain discovery algorithm for RT 1 C; a language in the RT family thathas parameterized roles and constraints. Our algorithm is a combination of the logic-programming style top-down query evaluation with tabling and a goal-directed version of thedeductive database style bottom-up evaluation. Our algorithm uses hints provided throughthe storage types to determine whether to use a top-down or bottom-up strategy for aparticular part of the proof; this enables the algorithm to touch only those credentials that …,*,2006,15

TIAMAT: a tool for interactive analysis of microdata anonymization techniques,Chenyun Dai; Gabriel Ghinita; Elisa Bertino; Ji-Won Byun; Ninghui Li,Abstract Releasing detailed data (microdata) about individuals poses a privacy threat; due tothe presence of quasi-identifier (QID) attributes such as age or zip code. Several privacyparadigms have been proposed that preserve privacy by placing constraints on the value ofreleased QIDs. However; in order to enforce these paradigms; data publishers need tools toassist them in selecting a suitable anonymization method and choosing the right systemparameters. We developed TIAMAT; a tool for analysis of anonymization techniques whichallows data publishers to assess the accuracy and overhead of existing anonymizationtechniques. The tool performs interactive; head-to-head comparison of anonymizationtechniques; as well as QID change-impact analysis. Other features include collection ofattribute statistics; support for multiple information loss metrics and compatibility with …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,12
Usable access control in collaborative environments: Authorization based on people-tagging,Qihua Wang; Hongxia Jin; Ninghui Li,Abstract We study attribute-based access control for resource sharing in collaborative workenvironments. The goal of our work is to encourage sharing within an organization bystriking a balance between usability and security. Inspired by the great success of a numberof collaboration-based Web 2.0 systems; such as Wikipedia and Del. icio. us; we propose anovel attribute-based access control framework that acquires information on users' attributesfrom the collaborative efforts of all users in a system; instead of from a small number oftrusted agents. Intuitively; if several users say that someone has a certain attribute; oursystem believes that the latter indeed has the attribute. In order to allow users to specify andmaintain the attributes of each other; we employ the mechanism of people-tagging; whereusers can tag each other with the terms they want; and tags from different users are …,*,2009,11
A construction for general and efficient oblivious commitment based envelope protocols,Jiangtao Li; Ninghui Li,Abstract The notion of Oblivious Commitment Based Envelope (OCBE) was recentlyproposed; it enables attribute-based access control without revealing any information aboutthe attributes. Previous OCBE protocols are designed by taking zero-knowledge proofprotocols that prove a committed value satisfies some property and changing the protocolsso that instead of one party proving to the other party; the two parties compute two keys thatagree if and only if the committed value indeed satisfy the property. In this paper; weintroduce a more general approach for designing OCBE protocols that uses zero-knowledgeproof protocols in a black-box fashion. We present a construction such that given a zero-knowledge proof protocol that proves a committed value satisfies a predicate; we have anOCBE protocol for that predicate with constant additional cost.

However; adoption is slowed by wellfoundedconcerns about privacy; especially given that data collected about individuals is beingcombined with information from other sources and analyzed by means of powerful tools (ie;data mining tools). Effective solutions for privacy protection are of interest to industry;government and society at large; but the challenge is to satisfy the oftenconflictingrequirements of all these stakeholders.

Recursive partitioning and summarization: a practical framework for differentially private data publishing,Wahbeh Qardaji; Ninghui Li,Abstract In this paper we consider the problem of differentially private data publishing. Inparticular; we consider the scenario in which a trusted curator gathers sensitive informationfrom a large number of respondents; creates a relational dataset where each tuplecorresponds to one entity; such as an individual; a household; or an organization; and thenpublishes a privacy-preserving (ie; sanitized or anonymized) version of the dataset. This hasbeen referred to as the" non-interactive" mode of private data analysis; as opposed to the"interactive" mode; where the data curator provides an interface through which users maypose queries about the data; and get (possibly noisy) answers.,Proceedings of the 7th ACM Symposium on Information; Computer and Communications Security,2012,9
Attack on the GridCode one-time password,Ian Molloy; Ninghui Li,Abstract SyferLock presents a one-time password system; GridCode; that allows an unaidedhuman to authenticate; reducing the cost of deployment. The one-time password system is ahuman computable challenge-response protocol which they claim defends against key-logging; replay; and brute force attacks; among others. We evaluate the security of the Grid-Code one-time password system and challenge these claims. We identify weak preimageresistance and character independence as key weaknesses of the GridCode system;leading to a variety of attacks. Our analysis indicates their scheme is akin to providing anadversary the ability to perform a brute force attack on a user's password in parallel withoutsignificant effort; lowering the effort required to recover a strong user password. Given asmall number of challenge-response pairs; an adversary can recover a user's password …,Proceedings of the 6th ACM Symposium on Information; Computer and Communications Security,2011,9
Towards analyzing complex operating system access control configurations,Hong Chen; Ninghui Li; Christopher S Gates; Ziqing Mao,Abstract An operating system relies heavily on its access control mechanisms to defendagainst local and remote attacks. The complexities of modern access control mechanismsand the scale of possible configurations are often overwhelming to system administratorsand software developers. Therefore mis-configurations are very common and the securityconsequences are serious. Given the popularity and uniqueness of Microsoft Windowssystems; it is critical to have a tool to comprehensively examine the access controlconfigurations. However; current studies on Windows access control mechanisms are mostlybased on known attack patterns. We propose a tool; WACCA; to systematically analyze theWindows configurations.

How to make Discretionary Access Control secure against trojan horses,Ninghui Li,Modern commercial of the shelf operating systems use Discretionary Access Control (DAC)to protect files and other operating system resources. According to the Trusted ComputerSystem Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)(often referred to as the Orange Book)[1]; DiscretionaryAccess Control is “a means of restricting access to objects based on the identity of subjectsand/or groups to which they belong. The controls are discretionary in the sense that asubject with a certain access permission is capable of passing that permission (perhapsindirectly) on to any other subject (unless restrained by mandatory access control).”,Parallel and Distributed Processing; 2008.

A nonmonotonic delegation logic with prioritized conflict handling,Ninghui Li; Benjamin N Grosof; Joan Feigenbaum,Abstract We extend previous work on Delegation Logic (DL)[11; 12]; a tractable andpractically implementable logic-based language for authorization in large-scale; open;distributed systems. We expressively generalize the previous version of DL (called D1LP) tohave nonmonotonic expressive features; including negation-as-failure; classical negation;and prioritized conflict handling. The resulting formalism is called D2LP. We discuss themotivations and usefulness of prioritized conflict handling and some subtleties andchallenges in extending DL to have it. Partly because of these subtleties; in this paper werestrict D2LP by prohibiting queries about delegation statements. Our technical approach todefining D2LP is based on tractably compiling a D2LP into a Generalized Courteous LP(GCLP)[7; 8]; which is in turn tractably compiled into an Ordinary LP (OLP).

Proactive defense of insider threats through authorization management,Yuqing Sun; Ninghui Li; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Among various attacks that may potentially target information systems; insider threatis recognized as an important factor of serious damage. In this paper; we investigate thisproblem from the view of authorizations in the context of access control. The objectives areto assess the sensitive authorizations in a system and to make appropriate arrangement forreducing the convenience of insider fraud. The proposed analytical framework takes thesecurity constraints and the user relationships into account besides the traditionalassessment of each independent user. Specially; different fraud patterns and insider attacksare formally modeled. These concerns are meaningful in practice since with the enforcementof security constraint like Separation of Duty; a single user only possesses partial privilegesfor a sensitive task. Thus a person who want to launch an attack need to adopt social …,Proceedings of 2011 international workshop on Ubiquitous affective awareness and intelligent interaction,2011,6

Algebraic construction for zero-knowledge sets,Rui Xue; Ning-Hui Li; Jiang-Tao Li,Abstract Zero knowledge sets is a new cryptographic primitive introduced by Micali; Rabin;and Kilian in FOCS 2003. It has been intensively studied recently. However all the existingZKS schemes follow the basic structure by Micali et al. That is; the schemes employ theMerkle tree as a basic structure and mercurial commitments as the commitment units tonodes of the tree. The proof for any query consists of an authentication chain. We propose inthis paper a new algebraic scheme that is completely different from all the existing schemes.Our new scheme is computationally secure under the standard strong RSA assumption.Neither mercurial commitments nor tree structure is used in the new construction. In fact; theprover in our construction commits the desired set without any trapdoor information; which isanother key important difference from the previous approaches.,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2008,6

Beyond risk-based access control: towards incentive-based access control,Debin Liu; Ninghui Li; XiaoFeng Wang; L Jean Camp,Abstract In recent years; risk-based access control has been proposed as an alternative totraditional rigid access control models such as multi-level security and role-based accesscontrol. While these approaches make the risks associated with exceptional accessaccountable and encourage the users to take low-risk actions; they also create thedisincentives for seeking necessary risky accesses. We introduce novel incentivemechanism based on Contract Theory. Another benefit of our approach is avoiding accurateestimate of the risk associated with each access. We demonstrate that Nash Equilibria canbe achieved in which the user's optimal strategy is performing the risk-mitigation efforts tominimize her organization's risk; and conduct human-subject studies to empirically confirmthe theoretical results.,*,2012,5
Worm-seal: Trustworthy data retention and verification for regulatory compliance,Tiancheng Li; Xiaonan Ma; Ninghui Li,Abstract As the number and scope of government regulations and rules mandatingtrustworthy retention of data keep growing; businesses today are facing a higher degree ofregulation and accountability than ever. Existing compliance storage solutions focus onproviding WORM (Write-Once Read-Many) support and rely on software enforcement of theWORM property; due to performance and cost reasons. Such an approach; however; offerslimited protection in the regulatory compliance setting where the threat of insider attacks ishigh and the data is indexed and dynamically updated (eg; append-only access logsindexed by the creator). In this paper; we propose a solution that can greatly improve thetrustworthiness of a compliance storage system; by reducing the scope of trust in the systemto a tamper-resistant Trusted Computing Base (TCB). We show how trustworthy retention …,*,2009,5
EXAM: an environment for access control policy analysis and management,Prathima Rao; Dan Lin; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li; Jorge Lobo,As distributed collaborative applications and architectures are adopting policy-basedsolutions for tasks such as access control; network security and data privacy; themanagement and consolidation of a large number of policies is becoming a crucialcomponent of such solutions. In large-scale distributed collaborative applications like webservices; there is need for analyzing policy interaction and performing policy integration. Inthis demonstration; we present EXAM; a comprehensive environment for policy analysis andmanagement; which can be used to perform a variety of functions such as policy propertyanalyses; policy similarity analysis; policy integration. Our work focuses on analysis ofaccess control policies written in XACML (Extensible Access Control Markup Language).

Direct static enforcement of high-level security policies,Qihua Wang; Ninghui Li,Abstract A high-level security policy states an overall safety requirement for a sensitive task.One example of a high-level security policy is a separation of duty policy; which requires asensitive task to be performed by a team of at least k users. Recently; Li and Wang [6]proposed an algebra for specifying a wide range of high-level security policies with bothqualification and quantity requirements on users who perform a task. In this paper; we studythe problem of direct static enforcement of high-level security policies expressed in thisalgebra. We formally define the notion of a static safety policy; which requires that every setof users together having all permissions needed to complete a sensitive task must contain asubset that satisfies the corresponding security requirement expressed as a term in thealgebra. The static safety checking problem asks whether an access control state satisfies …,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM symposium on Information; computer and communications security,2007,5

Security risk management using incentives,Debin Liu; Ninghui Li; XiaoFeng Wang; L Jean Camp,The authors propose an incentive-based access control (IBAC) that uses separatemechanisms for controlling aggregated risks and incentivizing users to reduce unnecessaryrisks. This mechanism encourages users to make necessary accesses while discouragingthem from taking unnecessary risks. To achieve this; the authors introduce novel incentivemechanism based on contract theory. They demonstrate that Nash equilibriums can beachieved in which users' optimal strategy is performing the risk-mitigation efforts to minimizetheir organization's risk; the authors' human-subject studies empirically confirm thesetheoretical results.,Security & Privacy; IEEE,2011,4
Anonymizing Network Traces with Temporal Pseudonym Consistency,Wahbeh Qardaji; Ninghui Li,The need for network traces has always been a critical element for the success of network;and network security; research. However; the plethora of privacy; legal and policy issues hasoften prevented access to collected traces. This has created the need for developinganonymization methods and tools to protect the privacy of the released traces whilepreserving utility in the data. A key dilemma in anonymizing network traces is whether topreserve IP pseudonym consistency; ie; whether the same IP address is replaced by thesame pseudo IP. On one hand; globally-consistent prefix-preserving IP addressanonymization is subject to various privacy attacks. On the other hand; many usages of thetrace data require some levels of consistency. We solve this dilemma by observing that abetter privacy-utility tradeoff can be obtained by maintaining temporal pseudonym …,Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW); 2012 32nd International Conference on,2012,3

A requirement common to many cooperative application environments is theneed for secure document exchange. By secure exchange we mean that documentconfidentiality and integrity are ensured when documents flow among different parties withinan organization or within different organizations. Ensuring document confidentiality meansthat document contents can only be disclosed to subjects authorized according to accesscontrol policies agreed upon by the various parties.

Usable Mandatory Access Control for Operating Systems,Ninghui Li; Ziqing Mao; Hong Chen,Abstract Modern operating systems primarily use discretionary access control (DAC) toprotect ﬁles and other operating system resources. DAC mechanisms are more user-friendlythan mandatory access control (MAC) systems; but are vulnerable to Trojan horse attacksand attacks exploiting buggy software. However; existing MAC systems for operatingsystems are difﬁcult to use. We identify several principles for designing usable accesscontrol systems and introduce the usable mandatory integrity protection (UMIP) model thatadds usable MAC to operating systems.,Information Assurance; Security and Privacy Services,2009,1
Symmetric Encryption,Ninghui Li,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,*,2009,1
A New Construction of Zero-Knowledge Sets Secure in Random Oracle Model,Rui Xue; Ninghui Li; Jiangtao Li,Zero knowledge sets is a new cryptographic primary in-troduced by Micali; Rabin; and Kilianin FOCS 2003. It is intensively investigated recently. However all schemes follow the basicframe by Micali et al. That is; the schemes employ Merkle tree as basic frame and mercurialcom-mitments as commitment units to nodes of the tree. The proof for any query constitutesof an authentication chain. We propose in this paper a new algebraic scheme that iscompletely different from all existing schemes. The new scheme is computationally secureunder standard assump-tion: Strong RSA assumption. It employs neither mercurialcommitments nor tree frame as all previous schemes did. In fact; the prover (also as thecommitter) in our construc-tion commits the desired set without trapdoor information; which isanother important difference from the previous ap-proaches.,Data; Privacy; and E-Commerce; 2007.

The foundational work of Harrisson-Ruzzo-Ullman revisited,N Li; MV Tripunitara,Abstract The work by Harrison; Ruzzo and Ullman (the HRU paper) on safety in the contextof the access matrix model is widely considered to be foundational work in access control. Inthis paper; we address two errors we have discovered in the HRU paper. To our knowledge;these errors have not been previously reported in the literature. The first error regards aproof that shows that safety analysis for mono-operational HRU systems is in NP. The errorstems from a faulty assumption that such systems are monotonie for the purpose of safetyanalysis. We present a corrected proof in this paper. The second error regards a mappingfrom one version of the safety problem to another that is presented in the HRU paper. Wedemonstrate that the mapping is not a reduction; and present a reduction that enables us toinfer that the second version of safety introduced in the HRU paper is also undecidable …,*,2006,1

Of centralimportance in any system for deciding whether requests should be authorized in such asystem are delegation of authority; negation of authority; and con icts between authorities.DL's approach to these issues and to the interplay among them borrows from previous workon delegation and trust management in the computer-security literature and previous workon negation and con ict handling in the logic-programming and non-monotonic reasoningliterature; but it departs from previous work in some crucial ways.

Trust Management.,Ninghui Li; Will Winsborough; John Mitchell,Background When a centralized authority knows all entities in the system; then authorizationdecisions can be made using standard identity-based or role-based security policies [3]. In adecentralized system; the authority that controls a resource and makes authorizationdecisions may not know the requester; hence it needs to rely on information provided byother parties. When indirect trust relationships exist in the physical world; certificate-basedtrust management can be used to document such trust relationships and to make inferences.For example; a Web site may offer access to university students based on digital studentidentification credentials issued by universities. When there does not exist even indirect trustrelationships; such as between a potential buyer and a seller in an online auction site;reputation-based trust management is needed.,*,2011,*

Several privacyparadigms have been proposed that preserve privacy by placing constraints on the value ofreleased QIDs. However; in order to enforce these paradigms; data publishers need tools toassist them in selecting a suitable anonymization method and choosing the right systemparameters. We developed TIAMAT; a tool for analysis of anonymization techniques whichallows data publishers to assess the accuracy and overhead of existing anonymizationtechniques. The tool performs interactive; head-to-head comparison of anonymizationtechniques; as well as QID change-impact analysis. Other features include collection ofattribute statistics; support for multiple information loss metrics and compatibility with …,*,2009,*

Relationship among China; Japan and South Korea in Energy Security: Competitors or Partners,Hao WU; Ning LI,In recent years; the statement propagating the competition for international resources hasbeen widespread. In line with this statement; some scholars analysize the energyrelationship among China; Japan and South Korea and believe that there are competitionsand even threats among them. However; it is proposed that these three countries sharemany common interests in energy security and strategies. The contradiction of theirstrategies does not pose a substantial threat to their interests of energy security. If China;Japan and South Korea regard one another as rivals in order to maintain one's own energysecurity; it does not help solve their energy security issues; but instead it makes the situationmore complicated; which could hinder the establishment of inter-relationship of mutual trustand the substantial progress of regional economic cooperation.,Jilin University Journal Social Sciences Edition,2009,*
Homomorphic Encryption,Ninghui Li,A hash function is a well-defined deterministic algorithm that takes as input data of arbitrarylength and produces a short fixed-length digital representation of the data; or a digest; as itsoutput. The output of a hash function can serve the role of a digital ''fingerprint''of the inputdata; as an important design property of hash functions is that of collision resilience: twohashes produced on different inputs are very unlikely to result in the same value.Furthermore; given a hash function output; it is normally infeasible to find a (previouslyunseen) input that matches that output (this property is called preimage resistance).,*,2009,*

The HIPPmodel is designed to defend against attacks targeting network server and client programsand to protect the system from careless mistakes users might make. It aims at not breakingexisting applications or existing ways of using and administering systems. HIPP has severalnovel features to achieve these goals. For example; it supports several types of partiallytrusted programs to support common system administration practices.

Purpose Based Access Control of Complex Data for Privacy Protection,Ninghui Li,ABSTRACT As privacy becomes a major concern for both consumers and enterprises; Inanyresearch efforts have been devoted to the development of privacy protecting technology. Werecently proposed a privacy preserving access control model for relational databases; wherepurpose information associated with a given data element specifies the intended use of thedata element. In this paper; We extend our previous work to handle other advanced datamanagement systems; such as the ones based on XML and the ones based on the object-relational data model. Another contribution of our paper is that we address the problem ofhow to determine the purpose for which certain data are accessed by a given user. Ourproposed solution relies on the well-known RBAC model as well as the notion of conditionalrole which is based on the notions of role attribute and system attribute.,*,*,*

A key feature of our model isthat it also supports explicit prohibitions; thus allowing privacy officers to specify that somedata should not be used for certain purposes. Another important issue addressed in thispaper is the granularity of data labeling; that is; the units of data with which purposes can beassociated. VVe address this issue in the context of relational databases and propose fourdifferent labeling schemes; each providing a different granularity.

Universal Accumulators with Efﬁcient Nonmembership Proofs,Jiangtao Lil; Ninghui Li; Rui Xue,Abstract. Based on the notion of accumulators; we propose a new cryptographic schemecalled universal accumulators. This scheme enables one to commit to a set of values using ashort accumulator and to efﬁciently compute a membership witness of any value that hasbeen accumulated. Unlike traditional accumulators; this scheme also enables one toefﬁciently compute a nonmembership witness of any value that has not been accumulated.We give a construction for universal accumulators and prove its security based on the strongRSA assumption. We fur-ther present a construction for dynamic universal accumulators; thisconstruction allows one to dynamically add and delete inputs with constant computationalcost. Our construction directly builds upon Camenisch and Lysyansl< aya's dynamicaccumulator scheme. Universal accumulators can be seen as an extension to dynamic …,*,*,*
CERIAS Tech Report 2005-20 ON SAFETY IN DISCRETIONARY ACCESS CONTROL,Ninghui Li; Mahesh V Tripunitara,Abstract An apparently prevailing myth is that safety is undecidable in Discretionary AccessControl (DAC); therefore; one needs to invent new DAC schemes in which safety analysis isdecidable. In this paper; we dispel this myth. We argue that DAC should not be equated withthe Harrison-Ruzzo-Ullman scheme; in which safety is undecidable. We present an efﬁcient(running time cubic in its input size) algorithm for deciding safety in the Graham-DenningDAC scheme; which subsumes the DAC schemes used in the literature on comparing DACwith other access control models. We also refute several claims made in recent work bySolworth and Sloan [26]; in which the authors present a new access control scheme basedon labels and relabelling and claim that it can “implement the full range of DAC models”.

Thesis/Dissertation Acceptance,Mohamed Yoosuf Mohamed Nabeel; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li; Samuel S Wagstaff; Dongyan Xu,In the cloud computing era; disseminating and sharing data through a third-party serviceprovider has never been more economical and easier than now. However; such serviceproviders cannot be trusted to assure the confidentiality of the data. In fact; data privacy andsecurity issues have been major concerns for many orga nizations utilizing such services.Data (eg electronic health records (EHRs)) often encode sensitive information and shouldbe protected in order to comply with various organizational policies; legal regulations;subscription conditions; and so forth. En cryption is a commonly adopted approach to protectthe confidentiality of the data. Encryption alone however is not sufficient as organizationsoften have to enforce finegrained access control on the data. Such control is often based onthe attributes of users; referred to as identity attributes; such as the roles of users in the …,*,*,*

Microdata Publishing with Algorithmic Privacy Guarantees,Tiancheng Li; Ninghui Li,ABSTRACT Many privacy notions for microdata publishing are defined based only on thesyntactic properties of the output data; and not the algorithms. As a result; they cannotprovide rigorous privacy guarantees. In this paper; we take a major step towards practicalsolutions for publishing microdata with algorithmic privacy guarantees. We introduce aformal algorithmic privacy notion called semantic kanonymity that offers effective protectionagainst re-identification attacks. We also present a systematic approach based oncolumnization and noisy count publishing for publishing microdata while achievingalgorithmic privacy. In addition to providing sound and quantitative privacy guarantees; ourapproach has another important advantage over existing methods: it can be applied tosparse high-dimensional data such as transaction data. Through experiments on the …,*,*,*
Thesis/Dissertation Acceptance,Prathima Rao; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li; Sunil Prabhakar; Luo Si,The widespread deployment of distributed applications and architectures such as Web Services; Virtual Private Networks and Service-Oriented Architectures has led to the proliferation of security policies that are specified and maintained independent of the applicationlogic. Policy-based approaches enhance flexibility and reduce the application developmenttime. Changes to the security requirements of an application simply entail modifying thepolicies without requiring changes to the application logic. Particularly important class ofsuch security policies is represented by access control policies which determine whether requests to protected resources are permitted or denied. Various types of access control models and mechanisms have emerged; such as PolicyMaker [2]; the ISO 10181-3 model [3] andthe eXtensible Access Control Mark-up Language (XACML)[4].

Thesis/Dissertation Acceptance,Ian Molloy; Ninghui Li; Elisa Bertino; Eugene Spafford; Christopher Clifton,Much of information security is; at its core; about classifying actions into two classes; eg;allow and deny; good and bad; or safe and dangerous; and ensuring this division is notviolated. The division balances the confidentiality; integrity; and availability of the resourcesbased on the needs of resource owners or organizations and is specified by a policy. One ofthe primary mechanisms used to ensure a safe division between the two classes isauthorization and access control. Access control systems make the distinction betweenallowed and denied at many levels and are central to the security of any organization. In themost basic access control models; permissions are directly assigned to users. When a userenters an organization they must be assigned a set of permissions re quired to perform theirduties. If a user changes jobs within the organization; their set of permissions is likely to …,*,*,*
