Skewtune: mitigating skew in mapreduce applications,YongChul Kwon; Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe; Jerome Rolia,Abstract We present an automatic skew mitigation approach for user-defined MapReduceprograms and present SkewTune; a system that implements this approach as a drop-inreplacement for an existing MapReduce implementation. There are three key challenges:(a)require no extra input from the user yet work for all MapReduce applications;(b) becompletely transparent; and (c) impose minimal overhead if there is no skew. The SkewTuneapproach addresses these challenges and works as follows: When a node in the clusterbecomes idle; SkewTune identifies the task with the greatest expected remaining processingtime. The unprocessed input data of this straggling task is then proactively repartitioned in away that fully utilizes the nodes in the cluster and preserves the ordering of the input data sothat the original output can be reconstructed by concatenation. We implement SkewTune …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,351
Skew-resistant parallel processing of feature-extracting scientific user-defined functions,YongChul Kwon; Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe; Jerome Rolia,Abstract Scientists today have the ability to generate data at an unprecedented scale andrate and; as a result; they must increasingly turn to parallel data processing engines toperform their analyses. However; the simple execution model of these engines can make itdifficult to implement efficient algorithms for scientific analytics. In particular; many scientificanalytics require the extraction of features from data represented as either amultidimensional array or points in a multidimensional space. These applications exhibitsignificant computational skew; where the runtime of different partitions depends on morethan just input size and can therefore vary dramatically and unpredictably. In this paper; wepresent SkewReduce; a new system implemented on top of Hadoop that enables users toeasily express feature extraction analyses and execute them efficiently. At the heart of the …,Proceedings of the 1st ACM symposium on Cloud computing,2010,145

Hadoop's adolescence: an analysis of Hadoop usage in scientific workloads,Kai Ren; YongChul Kwon; Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe,Abstract We analyze Hadoop workloads from three di? erent research clusters from a user-centric perspective. The goal is to better understand data scientists' use of the system andhow well the use of the system matches its design. Our analysis suggests that Hadoopusage is still in its adolescence. We see underuse of Hadoop features; extensions; andtools. We see significant diversity in resource usage and application styles; including someinteractive and iterative workloads; motivating new tools in the ecosystem. We also observesignificant opportunities for optimizations of these workloads. We find that job customizationand configuration are used in a narrow scope; suggesting the future pursuit of automatictuning systems. Overall; we present the first user-centered measurement study of Hadoopand find significant opportunities for improving its efficient use for data scientists.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,94
A study of skew in mapreduce applications,YongChul Kwon; Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe; Jerome Rolia,Abstract—This paper presents a study of skew—highly variable task runtimes—inMapReduce applications. We describe various causes and manifestations of skew asobserved in real world Hadoop applications. Runtime task distributions from theseapplications demonstrate the presence and negative impact of skew on performancebehavior. We discuss best practices recommended for avoiding such behavior and theirlimitations.,Open Cirrus Summit,2011,91
A case for a collaborative query management system,Nodira Khoussainova; Magda Balazinska; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; YongChul Kwon; Dan Suciu,Abstract: Over the past 40 years; database management systems (DBMSs) have evolved toprovide a sophisticated variety of data management capabilities. At the same time; tools formanaging queries over the data have remained relatively primitive. One reason for this isthat queries are typically issued through applications. They are thus debugged once and re-used repeatedly. This mode of interaction; however; is changing. As scientists (and others)store and share increasingly large volumes of data in data centers; they need the ability toanalyze the data by issuing exploratory queries. In this paper; we argue that; in these newsettings; data management systems must provide powerful query management capabilities;from query browsing to automatic query recommendations. We first discuss the requirementsfor a collaborative query management system. We outline an early system architecture …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0909.1778,2009,75
Analyzing massive astrophysical datasets: Can Pig/Hadoop or a relational DBMS help?,Sarah Loebman; Dylan Nunley; YongChul Kwon; Bill Howe; Magdalena Balazinska; Jeffrey P Gardner,As the datasets used to fuel modern scientific discovery grow increasingly large; theybecome increasingly difficult to manage using conventional software. Parallel databasemanagement systems (DBMSs) and massive-scale data processing systems such asMapReduce hold promise to address this challenge. However; since these systems have notbeen expressly designed for scientific applications; their efficacy in this domain has not beenthoroughly tested. In this paper; we study the performance of these engines in one specificdomain: massive astrophysical simulations. We develop a use case that comprises fiverepresentative queries. We implement this use case in one distributed DBMS and in thePig/Hadoop system. We compare the performance of the tools to each other and to hand-written IDL scripts. We find that certain representative analyses are easy to express in …,Cluster Computing and Workshops; 2009. CLUSTER'09. IEEE International Conference on,2009,74
Scalable clustering algorithm for N-body simulations in a shared-nothing cluster,YongChul Kwon; Dylan Nunley; Jeffrey P Gardner; Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe; Sarah Loebman,Abstract Scientists' ability to generate and collect massive-scale datasets is increasing. As aresult; constraints in data analysis capability rather than limitations in the availability of datahave become the bottleneck to scientific discovery. MapReduce-style platforms hold thepromise to address this growing data analysis problem; but it is not easy to express manyscientific analyses in these new frameworks. In this paper; we study data analysischallenges found in the astronomy simulation domain. In particular; we present a scalable;parallel algorithm for data clustering in this domain. Our algorithm makes two contributions.First; it shows how a clustering problem can be efficiently implemented in a MapReduce-style framework. Second; it includes optimizations that enable scalability; even in thepresence of skew. We implement our solution in the Dryad parallel data processing …,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2010,69
Fault-tolerant stream processing using a distributed; replicated file system,YongChul Kwon; Magdalena Balazinska; Albert Greenberg,Abstract We present SGuard; a new fault-tolerance technique for distributed streamprocessing engines (SPEs) running in clusters of commodity servers. SGuard is lessdisruptive to normal stream processing and leaves more resources available for normalstream processing than previous proposals. Like several previous schemes; SGuard isbased on rollback recovery [18]: it checkpoints the state of stream processing nodesperiodically and restarts failed nodes from their most recent checkpoints. In contrast toprevious proposals; however; SGuard performs checkpoints asynchronously: ie; operatorscontinue processing streams during the checkpoint thus reducing the potential disruptiondue to the checkpointing activity. Additionally; SGuard saves the checkpointed state into anew type of distributed and replicated file system (DFS) such as GFS [22] or HDFS [9] …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,60
Astronomy in the cloud: using mapreduce for image co-addition,Keith Wiley; Andrew Connolly; Jeff Gardner; S Krughoff; Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe; Y Kwon; Yingyi Bu,Abstract In the coming decade; astronomical surveys of the sky will generate tens ofterabytes of images and detect hundreds of millions of sources every night. The study ofthese sources will involve computation challenges such as anomaly detection andclassification and moving-object tracking. Since such studies benefit from the highest-qualitydata; methods such as image co-addition; ie; astrometric registration followed by per-pixelsummation; will be a critical preprocessing step prior to scientific investigation. With arequirement that these images be analyzed on a nightly basis to identify moving sourcessuch as potentially hazardous asteroids or transient objects such as supernovae; these datastreams present many computational challenges. Given the quantity of data involved; thecomputational load of these problems can only be addressed by distributing the workload …,Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific,2011,57
A latency and fault-tolerance optimizer for online parallel query plans,Prasang Upadhyaya; YongChul Kwon; Magdalena Balazinska,Abstract We address the problem of making online; parallel query plans fault-tolerant: ie;provide intra-query fault-tolerance without blocking. We develop an approach that not onlyachieves this goal but does so through the use of different fault-tolerance techniques atdifferent operators within a query plan. Enabling each operator to use a different fault-tolerance strategy leads to a space of fault-tolerance plans amenable to cost-basedoptimization. We develop FTOpt; a cost-based fault-tolerance optimizer that automaticallyselects the best strategy for each operator in a query plan in a manner that minimizes theexpected processing time with failures for the entire query. We implement our approach in aprototype parallel query-processing engine. Our experiments demonstrate that (1) there isno single best fault-tolerance strategy for all query plans;(2) often hybrid strategies that …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,48
Moirae: History-Enhanced Monitoring.,Magdalena Balazinska; YongChul Kwon; Nathan Kuchta; Dennis Lee,ABSTRACT In this paper; we investigate the benefits and challenges of integrating historyinto a near-real-time monitoring system; and present a general purpose continuousmonitoring engine; called Moirae; that supports this integration. Moirae is designed toenable different types of queries over live and historical data. In particular; Moirae supports(1) queries that look up specific historical information for each newly detected event and (2)queries that complement new events with information about similar past events. Moiraefocuses on applications where querying a historical log in its entirety would be too slow tomeet application needs; and could potentially yield an overwhelming number of results. Thegoal of the system is to produce the most relevant approximate results quickly and; whennecessary; additional more precise results incrementally. In this paper; we discuss the …,CIDR,2007,47
Managing Skew in Hadoop.,YongChul Kwon; Kai Ren; Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe; Jerome Rolia,Abstract Challenges in Big Data analytics stem not only from volume; but also variety:extreme diversity in both data types (eg; text; images; and graphs) and in operations beyondrelational algebra (eg; machine learning; natural language processing; image processing;and graph analysis). As a result; any competitive Big Data system must support some form ofparallel user-defined operations (UDOs) that can capture complex data processing tasksover complex data types without changing the core of the parallel data processing engine.Hadoop and other popular systems have been shown to provide a convenient programmingmodel for implementing parallel UDOs; but the “black-box” nature of UDOs complicates theautomatic load balancing required to achieve parallel scalability. In this paper; we presentan overview of some of our recent work that tackles the problem of load imbalance (aka …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2013,37
Hadoop's Adolescence; A Comparative Workloads Analysis from Three Research Clusters.,Kai Ren; Garth Gibson; YongChul Kwon; Magdalena Balazinska; Bill Howe,ABSTRACT We analyze Hadoop workloads from three different research clusters from anapplication-level perspective; with two goals:(1) explore new issues in application patternsand user behavior and (2) understand key performance challenges related to IO and loadbalance. Our analysis suggests that Hadoop usage is still in its adolescence. We seeunderuse of Hadoop features; extensions; and tools as well as significant opportunities foroptimization. We see significant diversity in application styles; including some “interactive”workloads; motivating new tools in the ecosystem. We find that some conventionalapproaches to improving performance are not especially effective and suggest somealternatives.

Advanced join strategies for large-scale distributed computation,Nicolas Bruno; YongChul Kwon; Ming-Chuan Wu,Abstract Companies providing cloud-scale data services have increasing needs to store andanalyze massive data sets (eg; search logs; click streams; and web graph data). For costand performance reasons; processing is typically done on large clusters of thousands ofcommodity machines by using high level scripting languages. In the recent past; there hasbeen significant progress in adapting well-known techniques from traditional relationalDBMSs to this new scenario. However; important challenges remain open. In this paper westudy the very common join operation; discuss some unique challenges in the large-scaledistributed scenario; and explain how to efficiently and robustly process joins in a distributedway. Specifically; we introduce novel execution strategies that leverage opportunities notavailable in centralized scenarios; and others that robustly handle data skew.

Session-based browsing for more effective query reuse,Nodira Khoussainova; YongChul Kwon; Wei-Ting Liao; Magdalena Balazinska; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Dan Suciu,Scientists today are able to generate and collect data at an unprecedented scale [1]. Af-terwards; scientists analyze and explore these datasets. Composing SQL queries; how-ever; is a significant challenge for scientists because most are not database experts. In thiswork; we leverage the collaborative environment that many scientists work in; which often includesa shared database with many scientists asking queries over it. As such; we utilize the collectiveknowledge of all the users by providing new users with access to a log of past queries; whichcan be used as starting points for writing new queries. However; navigating a large log of queriescan be difficult and overwhelming. In this paper; we introduce the Smart Query Browser(SQB) system. SQB supports efficient retrieval of relevant queries using what we callsession-based browsing.

Clustering events on streams using complex context information,YongChul Kwon; Wing Yee Lee; Magdalena Balazinska; Guiping Xu,Monitoring applications play an increasingly important role in many domains. They detectevents in monitored systems and take actions such as invoke a program or notify anadministrator. Often administrators must then manually investigate events to figure out thesource of a problem. Stream processing engines (SPEs) are general purpose datamanagement systems for monitoring applications. They provide low-latency streamprocessing but have limited or no support for manual event investigation. In this paper; wepropose a new technique for an SPE to support event investigation by automaticallyclassifying events on streams. Unlike previous stream clustering algorithms; our approachtakes into account complex user-defined contexts for events. Our approach comprises threekey components: an event context data model; a distance measure for event contexts …,Data Mining Workshops; 2008. ICDMW'08. IEEE International Conference on,2008,13
Identifying similar past events in a continuous monitoring system,YongChul Kwon; Guiping Xu; Magdalena Balazinska,ABSTRACT Previous work on data stream management systems has enabled sophisticatedtools for continuous; low latency stream processing. These tools are useful in manyapplication domains including computer system monitoring and network monitoring. In mostmonitoring applications; however; when an abnormal event occurs; an administrator mustmanually examine the current state and the history of the system to understand whathappened and diagnose the problem. To facilitate this process; we propose a newtechnique that automatically compares events on streams and identifies past events similarto newly detected events. With our technique; an administrator is shown not only an alert butalso past alerts that resemble the current situation. At the heart of our technique is a newsimilarity measure geared specifically toward the continuous monitoring domain. In this …,Proceedings of the Very Large Data Bases Conference,2007,6
An experimental comparison of iterative MapReduce frameworks,Haejoon Lee; Minseo Kang; Sun-Bum Youn; Jae-Gil Lee; YongChul Kwon,Abstract MapReduce has become a dominant framework in big data analysis; and thus therehave been significant efforts to implement various data analysis algorithms in MapReduce.Many data analysis algorithms are inherently iterative; repeating the same set of tasks until aconvergence. To efficiently support iterative algorithms at scale; a few variants of Hadoopand new platforms have been proposed and actively developed in both academia andindustry. Representative systems include HaLoop; iMapReduce; Twister; and Spark. In thispaper; we experimentally compare Hadoop and the aforementioned systems using variousworkloads and metrics. The five systems are compared through four iterative algorithms---PageRank; recursive query; k-means; and logistic regression---on 50 Amazon EC2machines (200 cores in total).

The suggestion system receives a partial query that is being created by auser. The suggestion system analyzes a query log having queries submitted by one or moreusers to identify features to suggest to the user based on a likelihood that users whosubmitted queries similar to the partial query included that feature in the query. The querysystem then presents to the user the identified features as suggestions to include in thepartial query.,*,2013,4
SQB: Session-based Query Browsing for More Effective Query Reuse,Nodira Khoussainova; Y Kwon; Wei-Ting Liao; Magdalena Balazinska; Wolfgang Gatterbauer; Dan Suciu,Abstract. Scientists are generating more data than ever before and are increasingly puttingthat data (or corresponding metadata) inside a relational database accessible through SQL.Composing non-trivial SQL queries; however; is difficult. Just like code reuse; query reusecan facilitate and accelerate the task of composing new queries. A key challenge is how bestto facilitate this reuse. In this paper; we introduce Smart Query Browser (SQB); a tool forsearching and browsing through a repository of SQL queries. SQB applies the idea of aquery session to improve query browsing and reuse. Informally; a query session is a set ofqueries authored by a single user to achieve a specific information goal. To evaluate SQB;we conduct a user study with 16 users and find that SQB reduces the query composition timeby 57% compared with a traditional; unassisted query composition setting.,*,2011,1
A latency and fault-tolerance optimizer for parallel data processing systems,Prasang Upadhyaya; Y Kwon; Magdalena Balazinska,Abstract—An important problem faced by today's parallel data processing systems is fault-tolerance: how to handle failures during the execution of long-running queries. Existingsystems either restart queries when failures occur or materialize intermediate results in ablocking fashion. The problem is that the former leads to expensive recovery while the latterslows-down normal processing and prevents pipelining. In this paper; we address the aboveproblem of intra-query fault-tolerance in parallel data processing systems. Our keyhypothesis is that a parallel system can achieve best performance by supporting efficientfault-tolerance strategies that do not require blocking but also by supporting the use ofdifferent strategies at different operators within a single query plan. Enabling each operatorto use a different fault tolerance strategy leads to a space of possible fault tolerance plans …,Univ. of Washington; Tech. Rep,2010,1
