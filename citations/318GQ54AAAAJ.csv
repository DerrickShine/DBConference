A consensus glossary of temporal database concepts,Curtis Dyreson; Fabio Grandi; Wolfgang Käfer; Nick Kline; Nikos Lorentzos; Yannis Mitsopoulos; Angelo Montanari; Daniel Nonen; Elisa Peressi; Barbara Pernici; John F Roddick; Nandlal L Sarda; Maria Rita Scalas; Arie Segev; Richard Thomas Snodgrass; Mike D Soo; Abdullah Tansel; Paolo Tiberio; Gio Wiederhold,Abstract This document contains definitions of a wide range of concepts specific to andwidely used within temporal databases. In addition to providing definitions; the documentalso includes separate explanations of many of the defined concepts. Two sets of criteria areincluded. First; all included concepts were required to satisfy four relevance criteria; and;second; the naming of the concepts was resolved using a set of evaluation criteria. Theconcepts are grouped into three categories: concepts of general database interest; oftemporal database interest; and of specialized interest. This document is a digest of a fullversion of the glossary 1. In addition to the material included here; the full version includessubstantial discussions of the naming of the concepts. The consensus effort that lead to thisglossary was initiated in Early 1992. Earlier status documents appeared in March 1993 …,ACM Sigmod Record,1994,950
A foundation for capturing and querying complex multidimensional data,Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian S Jensen; Curtis E Dyreson,Abstract On-line analytical processing (OLAP) systems considerably improve data analysisand are finding wide-spread use. OLAP systems typically employ multidimensional datamodels to structure their data. This paper identifies 11 modeling requirements formultidimensional data models. These requirements are derived from an assessment ofcomplex data found in real-world applications. A survey of 14 multidimensional data modelsreveals shortcomings in meeting some of the requirements. Existing models do not supportmany-to-many relationships between facts and dimensions; lack built-in mechanisms forhandling change and time; lack support for imprecision; and are generally unable to insertdata with varying granularities. This paper defines an extended multidimensional datamodel and algebraic query language that address all 11 requirements. The model reuses …,Information Systems,2001,340

On the semantics of “now” in databases,James Clifford; Curtis Dyreson; Tomás Isakowitz; Christian S Jensen; Richard Thomas Snodgrass,Abstract Although “now” is expressed in SQL and CURRENT_TIMESTAMP within queries;this value cannot be stored in the database. How ever; this notion of an ever-increasingcurrent-time value has been reflected in some temporal data models by inclusion ofdatabase-resident variables; such as “now”“until-changed;”“**;”“@;” and “-”. Time variablesare very desirable; but their used also leads to a new type of database; consisting of tupleswith variables; termed a variable database.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1997,237
Athena: a resource for rapid visualization and systematic analysis of Arabidopsis promoter sequences,Timothy R O'connor; Curtis Dyreson; John J Wyrick,Abstract Summary: To better understand the regulatory networks that control plant geneexpression; tools are needed to systematically analyze and visualize promoter regulatorysequences in Arabidopsis thaliana. We have developed the Athena database; whichcontains 30 067 predicted Arabidopsis promoter sequences and consensus sequences for105 previously characterized transcription factor (TF) binding sites. Athena provides fournovel tools to facilitate the analysis of promoter sequences: a promoter visualization tool toenable the rapid inspection of key regulatory sequences in multiple promoters; a TF bindingsite enrichment tool to identify statistically over-represented TF sites occurring in a user-selected subset of promoters; a data-mining tool to rapidly select promoter sequencescontaining the specified combination of TF binding sites; and a tool to display the …,Bioinformatics,2005,223

Supporting valid-time indeterminacy,Curtis E Dyreson; Richard Thomas Snodgrass,Abstract In valid-time indeterminacy it is known that an event stored in a database did in factoccur; but it is not known exactly when. In this paper we extend the SQL data model andquery language to support valid-time indeterminacy. We represent the occurrence time of anevent with a set of possible instants; delimiting when the event might have occurred; and aprobability distribution over that set. We also describe query language constructs to retrieveinformation in the presence of indeterminacy. These constructs enable users to specify theircredibility in the underlying data and their plausibility in the relationships among that data. Adenotational semantics for SQL's select statement with optional credibility and plausibilityconstructs is given. We show that this semantics is reliable; in that it never producesincorrect information; is maximal; in that if it were extended to be more informative; the …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1998,194
Extending practical pre-aggregation in on-line analytical processing,Torben Bach PedersenÝ; Christian S JensenÞ; Curtis E Dyreson,Abstract On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) based on a dimensional view of data isbeing used increasingly in traditional business applications as well as in applications suchas health care for the purpose of analyzing very large amounts of data. Pre-aggregation; theprior materialization of aggregate queries for later use; is an essential technique for ensuringadequate response time during data analysis. Full pre-aggregation; where all combinationsof aggregates are materialized; is infeasible. Instead; modern OLAP systems adopt thepractical pre-aggregation approach of materializing only select combinations of aggregatesand then re-use these for efficiently computing other aggregates. However; this re-use ofaggregates is contingent on the dimension hierarchies and the relationships between factsand dimensions satisfying stringent constraints. This severely limits the scope of the …,*,1999,112
Efficiently supporting temporal granularities,Curtis E.  Dyreson; William S.  Evans; Hong Lin; Richard T.  Snodgrass,Granularity is an integral feature of temporal data. For instance; a person's age is commonlygiven to the granularity of years and the time of their next airline flight to the granularity ofminutes. A granularity creates a discrete image; in terms of granules; of a (possiblycontinuous) time-line. We present a formal model for granularity in temporal operations thatis integrated with temporal indeterminacy; or" don't know when" information. We alsominimally extend the syntax and semantics of SQL-92 to support mixed granularities. Thissupport rests on two operations; scale and cast; that move times between granularities; eg;from days to months. We demonstrate that our solution is practical by showing howgranularities can be specified in a modular fashion; and by outlining a time-and space-efficient implementation. The implementation uses several optimization strategies to …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2000,97
Observing transaction-time semantics with/sub TT/XPath,Curtis E Dyreson,Transaction time is the time of database transactions that create; modify; or destroy facts. It isused to record when facts exist in a database. Accounting for transaction time is essential tosupporting audit queries that delve into past database states and differential queries thatpinpoint differences between two states. In a web context; transaction time is a problematicconcept because there are no transactions. Browsers and other consumers of web data canobserve snapshots of resources like XML documents but are rarely active participants intheir creation or destruction. This paper presents the TTXPath data model and querylanguage. TTXPath extends XPath with support for transaction time. XPath is a specificationlanguage for locations in an XML document. It serves as the basis for XML query languageslike XSLT and XQuery; XPath has no temporal semantics. To construct a TTXPath data …,Web Information Systems Engineering; 2001.

Information retrieval from an incomplete data cube,Curtis Dyreson,Abstract A complete data cube is a data cube. in which every aggregate value in themultidimensional space is stored or can be computed. An incomplete data cube is a datacube in which points in the multidimensional space are missing and'cannot be computed.This paper describes an incomplete data cube design. An incomplete data cube is modeledas a federation of cubettes. A cubette is a complete subcube within the incomplete datacube. The incomplete cube is built piecemeal by giving a concise; high-level specification ofeach cubette. An efficient algorithm to retrieve an aggregate value from the incomplete datacube is described. When a value cannot be retrieved because it is missing; alternatives at alower precision that can be retrieved are identified. When a value can be partially com-Ruted (ie; some of the values lower in the hierarchy are missing; but some are present) a …,VLDB,1996,77
Supporting imprecision in multidimensional databases using granularities,Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian S Jensen; Curtis E Dyreson,Online analytical processing (OLAP) technologies are being used widely; but the lack ofeffective means of handling data imprecision; which occurs when exact values are notknown precisely or are entirely missing; represents a major obstacle in applying thesetechnologies in many domains. The paper develops techniques for handling imprecisionthat aim to maximally reuse existing OLAP modeling constructs such as dimensionhierarchies and granularities. With imprecise data available in the database; queries aretested to determine whether or not they may be answered precisely given the available data;if not; alternative queries unaffected by the imprecision are suggested. When processingqueries affected by imprecision; techniques are proposed that take into account theimprecision in the grouping of the data; in the subsequent aggregate computation; and in …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 1999.

Valid-time indeterminacy,Curtis E Dyreson; Richard T Snodgrass,In valid-time indeterminacy; it is known that an event stored in a temporal database did infact occur; but it is not known exactly when the event occurred. An extension of the tuple-timestamped temporal data model; called the possible chronons data model; is presented tosupport valid-time indeterminacy. In the possible chronons data model; each event isrepresented with a set of possible chronons; delimiting when the event might have occurredand a probability distribution over the set. The TQuel query language is extended usingconstructs that specify the user's credibility in the underlying valid-time data and the user'splausibility in the relationships among that data. A formal tuple calculus semantics isoutlined; and it is shown that this semantics reduces to the determinate semantics ondeterminate data.,Data Engineering; 1993. Proceedings.

Capturing and querying multiple aspects of semistructured data,Curtis E Dyreson; Michael H Böhlen; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Motivated to a large extent by the substantial and growing prominence of the World-Wide Web and the potential benefits that may be obtained by applying database conceptsand techniques to web data management; new data models and query languages haveemerged that contend with the semistructured nature of web data. These models organizedata in graphs. The nodes in a graph denote objects or values; and each edge is labeledwith a single word or phrase. Nodes are described by the labels of the paths that lead tothem; and these descriptions serve as the basis for querying. This paper proposes anextensible framework for capturing and querying properties in a semistructured data model.The paper considers temporal properties of data; prices associated with data access; qualityratings associated with the data; and access restrictions on the data.

Managing versions of web documents in a transaction-time web server,Curtis E Dyreson; Hui-Ling Lin; Yingxia Wang,Abstract This paper presents a transaction-time HTTP server; called TTApache that supportsdocument versioning. A document often consists of a main file formatted in HTML or XMLand several included files such as images and stylesheets. A change to any of the filesassociated with a document creates a new version of that document. To construct adocument version history; snapshots of the document's files are obtained over time.Transaction times are associated with each file version to record the version's lifetime. Thetransaction time is the system time of the edit that created the version. Accounting fortransaction time is essential to supporting audit queries that delve into past documentversions and differential queries that pinpoint differences between two versions.

Timestamp semantics and representation,Curtis E Dyreson; Richard T Snodgrass,Abstract Many database management systems and operating systems provide support fortime values. At the physical level time values are known as timestamps. A timestamp has aphysical realization and a temporal interpretation. The physical realization is a pattern of bitswhile the temporal interpretation is the meaning of each bit pattern; that is; the time eachpattern represents. All previous proposals defined timestamps in terms of seconds.However; as we show; there are at least seven definitions of this fundamental time unit. Wepropose a more precise temporal interpretation; the time-line clock; that constructs a time-line by using different well-defined clocks in different periods. We also propose timestampformats for events; intervals and spans. These formats can represent all of time to thegranularity of a second; and all of recorded history to a finer granularity of a microsecond …,Information Systems,1993,56

A Tale of Two Schemas: Creating a Temporal XML Schema from a Snapshot Schema with t-XSchema,Faiz Currim; Sabah Currim; Curtis Dyreson; Richard T Snodgrass,Abstract The W3C XML Schema recommendation defines the structure and data types forXML documents. XML Schema lacks explicit support for time-varying XML documents. Usershave to resort to ad hoc; non-standard mechanisms to create schemas for time-varying XMLdocuments. This paper presents a data model and architecture; called τ XSchema; forcreating a temporal schema from a non-temporal (snapshot) schema; a temporal annotation;and a physical annotation. The annotations specify which portion (s) of an XML documentcan vary over time; how the document can change; and where timestamps should beplaced. The advantage of using annotations to denote the time-varying aspects is thatlogical and physical data independence for temporal schemas can be achieved whileremaining fully compatible with both existing XML Schema documents and the XML …,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2004,46

Approximate joins for data-centric XML,Nikolaus Augsten; Michael Bohlen; Curtis Dyreson; Johann Gamper,In data integration applications; a join matches elements that are common to two datasources. Often; however; elements are represented slightly different in each source; so anapproximate join must be used. For XML data; most approximate join strategies are basedon some ordered tree matching technique. But in data-centric XML the order is irrelevant:two elements should match even if their subelement order varies. In this paper we give asolution for the approximate join of unordered trees. Our solution is based on windowed pq-grams. We develop an efficient technique to systematically generate windowed pq-grams ina three-step process: sorting the unordered tree; extending the sorted tree with dummynodes; and computing the windowed pq-grams on the extended tree. The windowed pq-gram distance between two sorted trees approximates the tree edit distance between the …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,41
Adding valid time to XPath,Shuohao Zhang; Curtis E Dyreson,Abstract In this paper we extend the XPath data model and query language to include validtime. XPath is a language for specifying locations within an XML document. We extendXPath's data model by adding to each node a list of disjoint intervals or instants thatrepresents the valid time. The valid time for a node is constrained to be a subset of the validtime for a node's parent. We extend the XPath query language with an axis to access nodesin a valid-time view of the valid time for a node. The view is a calendar-specific formatting ofthe valid time in XML. By rendering the time in XML; we can reuse nontemporal XPath toextract the desired information within a valid-time axis. The extension is fully backwards-compatible with XPath.,International Workshop on Databases in Networked Information Systems,2002,37
Validating quicksand: Temporal schema versioning in τXSchema,Richard T Snodgrass; Curtis Dyreson; Faiz Currim; Sabah Currim; Shailesh Joshi,Abstract The W3C XML Schema recommendation defines the structure and data types forXML documents; but lacks explicit support for time-varying XML documents or for a time-varying schema. In previous work we introduced τXSchema; which is an infrastructure andsuite of tools to support the creation and validation of time-varying documents; withoutrequiring any changes to XML Schema. In this paper we extend τXSchema to supportversioning of the schema itself. We introduce the concept of a bundle; which is an XMLdocument that references a base (non-temporal) schema; temporal annotations describinghow the document can change; and physical annotations describing where timestamps areplaced. When the schema is versioned; the base schema and temporal and physicalschemas can themselves be time-varying documents; each with their own (possibly …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2008,34
Temporal granularity,Curtis E Dyreson; Richard T Snodgrass,Abstract There is one feature common to all temporal data: granularity. Granularity is the unitof measure for a temporal datum. 1 For instance; birthdates are typically measured in orknown to the granularity of days; business appointments to the granularity of hours; and trainschedules to that of minutes. The mixing of temporal data at different granularities in a singledatabase is common; but creates various problems.,*,1995,31
Scalability issues with using FSMWeb to test web applications,Anneliese A Andrews; Jeff Offutt; Curtis Dyreson; Christopher J Mallery; Kshamta Jerath; Roger Alexander,Abstract Web applications are fast becoming more widespread; larger; more interactive; andmore essential to the international use of computers. It is well understood that webapplications must be highly dependable; and as a field we are just now beginning tounderstand how to model and test Web applications. One straightforward technique is tomodel Web applications as finite state machines. However; large numbers of input fields;input choices and the ability to enter values in any order combine to create a state spaceexplosion problem. This paper evaluates a solution that uses constraints on the inputs toreduce the number of transitions; thus compressing the FSM. The paper presents ananalysis of the potential savings of the compression technique and reports actual savingsfrom two case studies.,Information and Software Technology,2010,29
Temporal xml,Curtis Dyreson; Fabio Grandi,There are two kinds of tables: frequency tables that display the count of respondents at thecrossing of the categorical attributes (in N) and magnitude tables that display information ona numerical attribute at the crossing of the categorical attributes (in R). For example; givensome census microdata containing attributes “Job” and “Town;” one can generate afrequency table displaying the count of respondents doing each job type in each town. If thecensus microdata also contain the “Salary;” attribute; one can generate a magnitude tabledisplaying the average salary for each job type in each town. The number n of cells in atable is normally much less than the number r of respondent records in a microdata file.However; tables must satisfy several linear constraints: marginal row and column totals.Additionally; a set of tables is called linked if they share some of the crossed categorical …,*,2009,29
Temporal coalescing with now granularity; and incomplete information,Curtis E Dyreson,Abstract This paper presents a novel strategy for temporal coalescing. Temporal coalescingmerges the temporal extents of value-equivalent tuples. A temporal extent is usuallycoalesced offline and stored since coalescing is an expensive operation. But the temporalextent of a tuple with now; times at different granularities; or incomplete times cannot bedetermined until query evaluation. This paper presents a strategy to partially coalescetemporal extents by identifying regions that are potentially covered. The covered regions canbe used to evaluate temporal predicates and constructors on the coalesced extent. Ourstrategy uses standard relational database technology.

Building test cases and oracles to automate the testing of web database applications,Lihua Ran; Curtis Dyreson; Anneliese Andrews; Renée Bryce; Christopher Mallery,Abstract Many organizations rely on web applications that use back-end databases to storeimportant data. Testing such applications requires significant effort. Manual testing alone isoften impractical; so testers also rely on automated testing techniques. However; currentautomated testing techniques may produce false positives (or false negatives) even in aperfectly working system because the outcome of a test case depends on the state of thedatabase which changes over time as data is inserted and deleted. The Automatic DatabaseTester (AutoDBT) generates functional test cases that account for database updates.AutoDBT takes as input a model of the application and a set of testing criteria. The modelconsists of a state transition diagram that shows how users navigate pages; a dataspecification that captures how data flows; and an update specification that shows how …,Information and Software Technology,2009,27
Temporal indeterminacy,Curtis E Dyreson; Richard T Snodgrass,Abstract Often a user knows only approximately when an event happened. For instance; shemay know that it happened “between 2 PM and 4 PM;”“sometime in the first week of June;”or “around the middle of the August.” These are examples of temporal indeterminacy.Information that is temporally indeterminate can be characterized as “don't know when”information; or more precisely;“don't know exactly when” information.

Using an incomplete data cube as a summary data sieve,Curtis E.  Dyreson,Abstract An incomplete data cube is a multidimensional hierarchy of aggregate values inwhich regions of the hierarchy; and the source data from which those regions are derived;are missing. We model an incomplete cube as a collection of complete sub-cubes calledcubettes. Each cubette is de ned using a precise; simple speci cation. The set of cubettespeci cations concisely characterises the information content of the cube. We discuss howthese simple speci cations can be used to generate a parser to sieve data from anunderlying data source and populate an incomplete cube.,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,1997,25
Symmetrically exploiting XML,Shuohao Zhang; Curtis Dyreson,Abstract Path expressions are the principal means of locating data in a hierarchical model.But path expressions are brittle because they often depend on the structure of data andbreak if the data is structured differently. The structure of data could be unfamiliar to a user;may differ within a data collection; or may change over time as the schema evolves. Thispaper proposes a novel construct that locates related nodes in an instance of an XML datamodel; independent of a specific structure. It can augment many XPath expressions and canbe seamlessly incorporated in XQuery or XSLT.,Proceedings of the 15th international conference on World Wide Web,2006,22
τXSchema: Support for data-and schema-versioned XML documents,Faiz Currim; Sabah Currim; Curtis E Dyreson; Shailesh Joshi; Richard T Snodgrass; Stephen W Thomas; Eric Roeder,XML is becoming an increasingly popular language for documents and data. XML can beapproached from two quite separate orientations: a document-centered orientation (eg;HTML) and a data-centered orientation (eg; relational and object-oriented databases).Schemas are important in both orientations. A schema defines the building blocks of an XMLdocument; such as the types of elements and attributes. An XML document can be validatedagainst a schema to ensure that the document conforms to the formatting rules for an XMLdocument (is well-formed) and to the types; elements; and attributes defined in the schema(is valid). A schema also serves as a valuable guide for querying and updating an XMLdocument or database. For instance; to correctly construct a query; eg; in XQuery; a user will(usually) consult the schema rather than the data. Finally; a schema can be helpful in …,TimeCenter Technical Report TR-91; 279 pages,2009,21

Incomplete information in multidimensional databases,Curtis E Dyreson; Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian S Jensen,ABSTRACT While incomplete information is endemic to real-world data; currentmultidimensional data models are not engineered to manage incomplete information inbase data; derived data; and dimensions. This chapter presents several strategies formanaging incomplete information in multidimensional databases. Which strategy to use isdependent on the kind of incomplete information present; and also on where it occurs in themultidimensional database. A relatively simple strategy is to replace incomplete informationwith appropriate; complete information. The advantage of this strategy is that allmultidimensional databases can manage complete information. Other strategies requiremore substantial changes to the multidimensional database. One strategy is to reflect theincompleteness in computed aggregates; which is possible only if the multidimensional …,Multidimensional databases: problems and solutions,2003,20
MESSIAH: missing element-conscious SLCA nodes search in XML data,Ba Quan Truong; Sourav S Bhowmick; Curtis Dyreson; Aixin Sun,Abstract Keyword search for smallest lowest common ancestors (SLCAs) in XML data hasbeen widely accepted as a meaningful way to identify matching nodes where their subtreescontain an input set of keywords. Although SLCA and its variants (eg; MLCA) performadmirably in identifying matching nodes; surprisingly; they perform poorly for searches onirregular schemas that have missing elements; that is;(sub) elements that are optional; orappear in some instances of an element type but not all (eg; a" population" subelement in a"city" element might be optional; appearing when the population is known and absent whenthe population is unknown). In this paper; we generalize the SLCA search paradigm tosupport queries involving missing elements. Specifically; we propose a novel property calledoptionality resilience that specifies the desired behaviors of an XML keyword search (XKS …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,19
Towards a temporal world-wide web: a transaction-time server,Curtis E Dyreson,Abstract Transaction time is the time of a database transaction; ie; an insertion; update; ordeletion. A transaction-time database stores the transaction-time history of a database andsupports transaction timeslice queries that retrieve past database states. This paperintroduces transaction time to the World-wide Web. In a web context; transaction time is themodification time of a resource such as an XML document. A transaction-time web serverarchives resource versions and supports transaction timeslice. Unlike a database server; aweb server is typically uninvolved in the update of a resource; instead it is only active whena resource is requested. This paper describes a lazy update protocol that enables a webserver to manage resource versions during resource reads. An important benefit of ourapproach is that transaction-time can be supported by a transparent; minimal web server …,Proceedings of the 12th Australasian database conference,2001,17
Efficiently supporting temporal granularities in a DBMS,Curtis Dyreson; Richard Snodgrass; Marshall Freiman,Abstract Granularity is an integral feature of temporal data. For instance; a person's age iscommonly given to the granularity of years and the time of their next airline flight to thegranularity of minutes. A granularity creates a discrete image; in terms of granules; of a(possibly continuous) time-line. Pairs of granularities are related in that some granularitiesare finer or coarser with respect to other granularities. A granularity graph records all therelationships between granularities; even among granularities in different calendars.Indeterminacy; or" don't know when" information; is a companion to granularity.

The system establishes a foundation forobtaining high query processing performance while pre-computing only limited aggregates.The paper shows how this reuse of aggregates is enabled through dimensiontransformations that occur transparently to the user.,VLDB,2000,16
Adding temporal constraints to XML schema,Faiz A Currim; Sabah A Currim; Curtis E Dyreson; Richard T Snodgrass; Stephen W Thomas; Rui Zhang,If past versions of XML documents are retained; what of the various integrity constraintsdefined in XML Schema on those documents? This paper describes how to interpret suchconstraints as sequenced constraints; applicable at each point in time. We also considerhow to add new variants that apply across time; so-called nonsequenced constraints. Ourapproach supports temporal documents that vary over both valid and transaction time;whose schema can vary over transaction time. We do this by replacing the schema with a(possibly time-varying) temporal schema and replacing the document with a temporaldocument; both of which are upward compatible with conventional XML and withconventional tools like XMLLINT; which we have extended to support the temporalconstraints introduced here.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,15
The data model for time,Curtis E Dyreson; Michael D Soo; Richard T Snodgrass,Abstract TSQL2 adds comprehensive support for time to SQL-92. This support rests on threetemporal dimensions: user-defined time; valid time; and transaction time. A single model oftime; however; is the foundation for each of these separate dimensions. In this chapter; wepresent TSQL2's model of time. We focus on the concepts of an instant and a period; discusshow each is modeled in TSQL2; and give an overview of the semantics of operations on themodeled entities.,*,1995,15
Pre-aggregation with probability distributions,Igor Timko; Curtis E Dyreson; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Motivated by the increasing need to analyze complex; uncertain multidimensionaldata this paper proposes probabilistic OLAP queries that are computed using probabilitydistributions rather than atomic values. The paper describes how to create probabilitydistributions from base data; and how the distributions can be subsequently used in pre-aggregation. Since the probability distributions can become large; we show how to achievegood time and space efficiency by approximating the distributions. We present the results ofseveral experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. The work ismotivatedwith a real-world case study; based on our collaboration with a leading Danishvendor of location-based services. This paper is the first to consider the approximateprocessing of probabilistic OLAP queries over probability distributions.,Proceedings of the 9th ACM international workshop on Data warehousing and OLAP,2006,14
Validating Quicksand: Schema Versioning in\tauXSchema,Curtis Dyreson; Richard T Snodgrass; Faiz Currim; Sabah Currim; Shailesh Joshi,The W3C XML Schema recommendation defines the structure and data types for XMLdocuments; but lacks explicit support for time-varying XML documents or for a time-varyingschema. In previous work we introduced\tauXSchema which is an infrastructure and suite oftools to support the creation and validation of time-varying documents; without requiring anychanges to XML Schema. In this paper we extend\tauXSchema to support versioning of theschema itself. We introduce the concept of a bundle; which is an XML document thatreferences a base (nontemporal) schema; temporal annotations describing how thedocument can change; and physical annotations describing where timestamps are placed.When the schema is versioned; the base schema and temporal and physical schemas canthemselves be time-varying documents; each with their own (possibly versioned) …,Data Engineering Workshops; 2006.

Weaving temporal and reliability aspects into a schema tapestry,Curtis Dyreson; Richard T Snodgrass; Faiz Currim; Sabah Currim; Shailesh Joshi,Abstract In aspect-oriented programming (AOP) a cross-cutting concern is implemented inan aspect. An aspect weaver blends code from the aspect into a program's code atprogrammer-specified cut points; yielding an aspect-enhanced program. In this paper; weapply some of the concepts from the AOP paradigm to data. Like code; data also has cross-cutting concerns such as versioning; security; privacy; and reliability. We propose modelinga cross-cutting data concern as a schema aspect. A schema aspect describes the structureof the metadata in the cross-cutting concern; identifies the types of data elements that can bewrapped with metadata; ie; the cut points; and provides some simple constraints on the useof the metadata. Several schema aspects can be applied to a single data collection; thoughin this paper we focus on just two aspects: a reliability aspect and a temporal aspect.

Integrating multiple calendars using τ ZAMAN,Bedirhan Urgun; Curtis E Dyreson; Richard T Snodgrass; Jessica K Miller; Nick Kline; Michael D Soo; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Programmers are increasingly interested in developing applications that can beused internationally. Part of the internationalization effort is the ability to engineerapplications to use dates and times that conform to local calendars yet can inter-operate withdates and times in other calendars; for instance between the Gregorian and Islamiccalendars. equation image Z AMAN is a system that provides a natural language-andcalendar-independent framework for integrating multiple calendars. equation image ZAMAN performs 'runtime-binding'of calendars and language support. A running equationimage Z AMAN system dynamically loads calendars and language support tables from XML-formatted files.

Schema-mediated exchange of temporal XML data,Curtis Dyreson; Richard T Snodgrass; Faiz Currim; Sabah Currim,Abstract When web servers publish data formatted in XML; only the current state of the datais (generally) published. But data evolves over time as it is updated. Capturing that evolutionis vital to recovering past versions; tracking changes; and evaluating temporal queries. Thispaper presents a system to build a temporal data collection; which records the history ofeach published datum rather than just its current state. The key to exchanging temporal datais providing a temporal schema to mediate the interaction between the publisher and thereader. The schema describes how to construct a temporal data collection by “gluing”individual states into an integrated history.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2006,12
Efficient timestamp input and output,Curtis E Dyreson; Richard T Snodgrass,Abstract In this paper we provide efficient algorithms for converting between timestampvalues that signify some number of seconds from an arbitrary origin; and character stringsspecifying Gregorian dates; such as 'January 1; 1993'. We give several algorithms thatexplore a range of time and space trade-offs. Unlike previous algorithms; those discussedhere have a constant time cost over a greatly extended range of timestamp values. Thesealgorithms are especially useful in operating systems and in database managementsystems.,Software: Practice and Experience,1994,12
Windowed pq-grams for approximate joins of data-centric XML,Nikolaus Augsten; Michael Böhlen; Curtis Dyreson; Johann Gamper,Abstract In data integration applications; a join matches elements that are common to twodata sources. Since elements are represented slightly different in each source; anapproximate join must be used to do the matching. For XML data; most existing approximatejoin strategies are based on some ordered tree matching technique; such as the tree editdistance. In data-centric XML; however; the sibling order is irrelevant; and two elementsshould match even if their subelement order varies. Thus; approximate joins for data-centricXML must leverage unordered tree matching techniques. This is computationally hard sincethe algorithms cannot rely on a predefined sibling order. In this paper; we give a solution forapproximate joins based on unordered tree matching. The core of our solution arewindowed pq-grams which are small subtrees of a specific shape. We develop an …,The VLDB Journal,2012,11
Aspect-oriented relational algebra,Curtis E Dyreson,Abstract In this paper we apply the aspect-oriented programming (AOP) paradigm to therelational algebra. AOP is a way to add support for cross-cutting concerns to existing codewithout directly modifying that code. Data; like code; also has cross-cutting concerns such asversioning; privacy; and reliability. AOP techniques can be used to weave metadata aroundan application's data. The metadata imbues the data with additional semantics that must beobserved in constraint and query processing. In this paper we show how to modify therelational algebra to process data woven together with metadata. We also analyze theoverhead on evaluating an aspect-enhanced query.,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2011,10
MetaXPath,Curtis E Dyreson; Michael H Böhlen; Christian S Jensen,Abstract This paper presents the METAXPath data model and query language. METAXPathextends XPath with support for XML metadata. XPath is a specification language forlocations in an XML document. It serves as the basis for XML query languages like XSLTand the XML Query Algebra. The METAXPath data model is a nested XPath tree. Each levelof metadata induces a new level of nesting. The data model separates metadata and datainto different dataspaces; supports meta-metadata; and enables sharing of metadatacommon to a group of nodes without duplication. The METAXPath query language has alevel shift operator to shift a query from a data,Journal of Digital Information,2001,10
Historical indeterminacy,Curtis E Dyreson; Richard T Snodgrass,Abstract In historical indeterminacy; it is known that an event stored in a temporal databasedid in fact occur; but it is not known exactly when the event occurred. We present thepossible tuples data model; in which each indeterminate event is represented with a set ofpossible events that delimits when the event might have occurred; and a probabilitydistribution over that set. We extend the TQuel query language with constructs that specifythe user's credibility in the underlying historical data and in the user's plausibility in therelationships among that data. We provide a formal tuple calculus semantics; and show thatthis semantics reduces to the determinate semantics. We outline an efficient representationof historical indeterminacy; and efficient query processing algorithms; demonstrating thepracticality of our proposed approach. 1 Department of Computer Science University of …,*,1992,10

Adatabase search engine is capable to access and advertise database on the WWW. Jungleis a database search engine prototype developed at Aalborg University. Operating throughJDBC connections to remote databases; Jungle extracts and indexes database data andmeta-data; building a data store of database information. This information is used toevaluate and optimize queries in the AQUA query language. AQUA is a natural and intuitivedatabase query language that helps users to search for information without knowing howthat information is structured.

The Baseline Clock,Curtis E Dyreson; Richard T Snodgrass,Abstract This chapter specifies a single; unified clock for TSQL2 timestamps. A times-tampencodes a time value and is composed of a physical realization and a temporalinterpretation. The physical realization is an encoding as a pattern of bits while the temporalinterpretation stipulates the meaning of each bit pattern; the time to which each patterncorresponds. Without such an interpretation; the meaning of a timestamp stored in adatabase or by an operating system is unclear.,*,1995,9

Valid-time indeterminacy.,Curtis Elliott Dyreson,In valid-time indeterminacy; it is known that an event stored in a temporal database did infact occur; but it is not known exactly when the event occurred. We extend a tuple-timestamped temporal data model to support valid-time indeterminacy and outline itsimplementation. This work is novel in that previous research; although quite extensive; hasnot studied this particular kind of incomplete information. To model the occurrence time of anevent; we introduce a new data type called an indeterminate instant. Our thesis is that byrepresenting an indeterminate instant with a set of contiguous chronons and a probabilitydistribution over that set; it is possible to characterize a large number of (possibly weighted)alternatives; to devise intuitive query language constructs; including schema specification;temporal constants; temporal predicates and constructors; and aggregates; and to …,*,1994,9
Querying virtual hierarchies using virtual prefix-based numbers,Curtis E Dyreson; Sourav S Bhowmick; Ryan Grapp,Abstract Prefix-based numbering is a popular method for numbering nodes in a hierarchy.But prefix-based numbering breaks down when a node's location within a hierarchychanges; such as when XML data is queried after being transformed by an XSLT program orwhen data is reformatted in the return clause of an inner FLWR expression in a nestedXQuery program. A query on transformed data cannot be evaluated as efficiently since theextant prefix-based node numbers cannot be used (unless the data is materialized and thenrenumbered; which can be expensive). In this paper we present a novel strategy to virtuallytransform the data without instantiating and renumbering. Our method; which we call virtualprefix-based numbering; couples each prefix-based node number with a level array thatlocates the node in the numbering space of the virtual hierarchy. The virtual numbering …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2014,8
A probabilistic data model and algebra for location-based data warehouses and their implementation,Igor Timko; Curtis Dyreson; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract This paper proposes a novel; probabilistic data model and algebra that improvesthe modeling and querying of uncertain data in spatial OLAP (SOLAP) to support location-based services. Data warehouses that support location-based services need to combinecomplex hierarchies; such as road networks or transportation infrastructures; with static anddynamic content; eg; speed limits and vehicle positions; respectively. Both the hierarchiesand the content are often uncertain in real-world applications. Our model supports the use ofprobability distributions within both facts and dimensions. We give an algebra that correctlyaggregates uncertain data over uncertain hierarchies. This paper also describes animplementation of the model and algebra; gives a complexity analysis of the algebra; andreports on an empirical; experimental evaluation of the implementation.

Now in temporal databases,Curtis E Dyreson; Christian S Jensen; Richard T Snodgrass,The simplest way to incorporate unknown values into the relational model; is to allowvariables; in addition to constants; as entries in the columns of relations. Such constructs arecalled tables; instead of relations. A table is an incomplete database; and represents a set ofcomplete databases; each obtained by substituting all variables with constants. Differentoccurrences of the same variable (marked null) are substituted with the same constant. Thesubstitution is thus a function from the variables and constants; to the constants; such thatthe function is identity on the constants. A table T then represents the set of relations;denoted rep (T); defined as {v (T): v is a valuation}. Then the certain answer to a query q on atable T; denoted sure (q; T) is the set of tuples that occur in every answer obtained byapplying the query to every database in rep (T). In other words; the certain answer to q on …,*,2009,8
Polymorphic xml restructuring,Shuohao Zhang; Curtis Dyreson,ABSTRACT Restructuring is a process that transforms data to a different structure. One canrestructure XML data using a query language such as XQuery or XSLT; but formulating thequery is sometimes cumbersome and the query may break when the source structurechanges. This paper introduces poly-transform; a polymorphic restructuring algorithm forXML. A poly-transform takes a declarative specification of the target and can be applied to avariety of differently structured sources. We describe the polymorphic restructuring techniqueand report on experiments that suggest that the technique can be efficiently implemented.,Proceedings of IIWeb; WWW Workshop; International World Wide Web Conference Committee; IW3C2,2006,8
AutoDBT: A framework for automatic testing of web database applications,Lihua Ran; Curtis E Dyreson; Anneliese Andrews,Abstract The complex functionalities and high demands of software quality make manualtesting of a web application ineffective. Automatic software testing methods can help todetermine if a web application is working correctly; but existing methods are unable to testwhether such an application interacts correctly with a back-end database. This paperelaborates an approach; called the Automatic Database Tester (AutoDBT); that extends thefunctional or black-box testing of a web database application to include database updates.AutoDBT takes as input a model of the application and a set of test criteria. The modelconsists of a state transition diagram showing how a user navigates among pages in theapplication; and a data specification which captures how data flows in the application andhow the database is updated.

Mr. fusion: A programmable data fusion middleware subsystem with a tunable statistical profiling service,Andy Franz; Radek Mista; David Bakken; Curtis Dyreson; Muralidhar Medidi,Voting is the process of combining multiple replies from replicated servers into a singlereply. Data fusion is similar to but more general than voting. In data fusion; the input sourcesare not necessarily replicated servers; hence the inputs exhibit greater variance. Data fusionis a fundamental building block in distributed systems. It occurs in diverse contexts such asconsensus; sensor networks; intrusion detection; and hierarchical resource monitoring;among others. This paper describes Mr. Fusion; a framework that provides data fusion inmiddleware. The heart of Mr. Fusion is a Fusion Core module that provides mechanisms forprogramming a wide variety of data fusion algorithms. Another part is a Fusion StatusService that monitors low-level outputs from the Fusion Core and alerts subscribers todivergent values or timings.

A jumping spider: Restructuring the WWW graph to index concepts that span pages,Curtis E Dyreson,Abstract: A search engine can index a concept that appears entirely on a single page. Butconcepts can span several pages. For instance; a page on trees may be linked to a page onlecture notes for a data structures course. If the trees page does not specifically mentionlecture notes; then a search engine search for lecture notes on trees will; at best; onlypartially match each page. In this paper we describe a practical system; called a JumpingSpider; to index concepts that span more than one page. We assume that a multi-pageconcept is created by a concept path; consisting of some number of hyperlinks; that transitsthrough pages with specific content. For instance; there must be a concept path from thelecture notes page to the trees page to create the lecture notes on trees concept. Theconcept paths must be relatively few (certainly much fewer than the overall number of …,Proceedings of the Workshop on Reuse of Web Information; held in conjunction with the 7th WWW Conference,1998,8
A timestamp representation,Curtis E Dyreson; Richard T Snodgrass,Abstract Many database management systems and operating systems provide support fortime values. This support is present at both the logical and physical levels. The logical levelis the user's view of the time values and the query level operations permitted on thosevalues; while the physical level concerns the bit layout of the time values and the bit leveloperations on those values. The physical level serves as a platform for the logical level but isinaccessible to the average user. This chapter presents aone design for the physical level oftime values in TSQL2.,*,1995,8
Schema-less; semantics-based change detection for XML documents,Shuohao Zhang; Curtis Dyreson; Richard T Snodgrass,Abstract Schema-less change detection is the processes of comparing successive versionsof an XML document or data collection to determine which portions are the same and whichhave changed; without using a schema. Change detection can be used to reduce space inan historical data collection and to support temporal queries. Most previous research hasfocused on detecting structural changes between document versions. But techniques thatdepend on structure break down when the structural change is significant. This paperdevelops an algorithm for detecting change based on the semantics; rather than on thestructure; of a document. The algorithm is based on the observation that information thatidentifies an element is often conserved across changes to a document. The algorithm firstisolates identifiers for elements. It then uses these identifiers to associate elements in …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2004,7
Sanitizing using metadata in MetaXQuery,Hao Jin; Curtis Dyreson,Abstract Metadata plays an important role in describing and proscribing data in bothtraditional and XML applications. In this paper; we present an extension of the XML datamodel and XQuery query language to certify the reachability of data and to sanitize data withthe existence of metadata; especially proscriptive metadata. The data model extension iscalled MetaDOM; and the query language is called MetaXQuery. This paper describes acertify function to check if the metadata in the data model is correctly embedded; in otherwords; whether all of the data nodes are reachable from the root. It also describes a sanitizefunction that automatically corrects the data model if it is invalid. The sanitize function canalso be used to generate a view of the data from a specific metadata perspective.,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2005,6
Unifying sequenced and non-sequenced semantics,Curtis E Dyreson; Venkata A Rani; Amani Shatnawi,Sequenced and nonsequenced semantics were introduced as different semantics for theevaluation of an operation in a temporal database such as a query or data modification. Inthis paper we present a new framework that shows both semantics are variants of a generaltemporal semantics. Our framework uses tuple lineage to track tuples through operations.We present the general semantics and show additional semantics that can be realized. Wealso show how the semantics can be woven into an operation using annotations.,Temporal Representation and Reasoning (TIME); 2015 22nd International Symposium on,2015,5
SINBAD: towards structure-independent querying of common neighbors in XML databases,Ba Quan Truong; Sourav S Bhowmick; Curtis Dyreson,Abstract xml query languages use directional path expressions to locate data in an xml datacollection. They are tightly coupled to the structure of a data collection; and can fail whenevaluated on the same data in a different structure. This paper extends XPath expressionswith a new structure-independent; non-directional axis called the neighborhood axis. Givena pair of context nodes; the neighborhood axis returns those nodes that are commonneighbors of the context nodes in any direction. Such axis finds its usefulness in structure-independent query formulation as well as supporting relevant results computation in design-independent xml keyword search. We propose an algorithm called sinbad that exploits thenovel notion of node locality and small size of xml structure tree to efficiently determine thecommon neighbors of the context nodes. Our empirical study demonstrates that sinbad …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2012,5
Data aspects in a relational database,Curtis Dyreson; Omar U Florez,Abstract Data has cross-cutting concerns such as versioning; privacy; and reliability. In thispaper we sketch support such concerns by adapting the aspect-oriented programming(AOP) paradigm to data. Our goal; shared by AOP; is to re-engineer applications to supportcross-cutting concerns without directly modifying the application's data or queries. Wepropose modeling a cross-cutting data concern as a data aspect. A data aspect weavesmetadata around an application's data and queries; imbuing them with additional semanticsfor constraint and query processing.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,5
Supporting Proscriptive Metadata in an XML DBMS,Hao Jin; Curtis Dyreson,Abstract MetaXQuery is a language for querying data enhanced with metadata. TheMetaXQuery data model (MetaDOM) attaches metadata to each element in an XML datacollection; and extends XQuery with several constructs to process and query metadata. Inthis paper we show how to extend a native XML DBMS; namely eXist; to supportMetaXQuery. The additional query functionality can be efficiently implemented by judiciousreuse of eXist's indexes and query evaluation engine.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2008,5
Impediments to survivability of the electric power grid and some collaborative EE-CS research issues to solve them,David Bakken; Anjan Bose; Curtis Dyreson; Sudipto Bhowmik; Ioanna Dionysiou; Harald Gjermundrod; Lin Xu,The electric power industry by its very nature must have its supply and demand in very closebalance at all times. Supply (generation) needs to be matched accurately and in real-time todemand; otherwise unbalance can result in partial or complete breakdown of the grid [1].Recent deregulation is allowing many more participants in the power grid. Unfortunately; itsstatus dissemination network was designed for the handful of regulated monopolies of theday; and by engineers who were not experts in computer networking or distributed systems.The monopoly in generating; transmitting and managing power that was present at designtime is therefore reflected in the present hardwired control infrastructure of the power grid(see Figure 1).

Interruption-sensitive empty result feedback: Rethinking the visual query feedback paradigm for semistructured data,Sourav S Bhowmick; Curtis Dyreson; Byron Choi; Min-Hwee Ang,Abstract The usability of visual querying schemes for tree and graph-structured data can begreatly enhanced by providing feedback during query construction; but feedback atinopportune times can hamper query construction. In this paper; we rethink the traditionalway of providing feedback. We describe a novel vision of interruption-sensitive queryfeedback where relevant notifications are delivered quickly but at an appropriate momentwhen the mental workload of the user is low. Though we focus on one class of queryfeedback; namely empty result detection; where a user is notified when a partiallyconstructed visual query yields an empty result; our new paradigm is applicable to otherkinds of feedback. We present a framework called iSERF that bridges the classical databaseproblem of empty-result detection with intelligent notification management from the …,Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2015,4
Supporting data aspects in pig latin,Curtis E Dyreson; Omar U Florez; Akshay Thakre; Vishal Sharma,Abstract In this paper we apply the aspect-oriented programming (AOP) paradigm to PigLatin; a dataflow language for cloud computing; used primarily for the analysis of massivedata sets. Missing from Pig Latin is support for cross-cutting data concerns. Data; like code;has cross-cutting concerns such as versioning; privacy; and reliability. AOP techniques canbe used to weave metadata around Pig data. The metadata imbues the data with additionalsemantics that must be observed in the evaluation of Pig Latin programs. In this paper weshow how to modify Pig Latin to process data woven together with metadata. The dataweaver is a layer that maps a Pig Latin program to an augmented Pig Latin program usingPig Latin templates or patterns. We also show how to model additional levels of advice; ie;meta-metadata.,Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Aspect-oriented software development,2013,4
Building a display of missing information in a data sieve,Curtis E Dyreson; Omar U Florez,Abstract A data sieve filters a data stream to harvest data of interest and summarizes theharvested data in a multidimensional database (MDB). To build the data sieve; a designersupplies a list of filters. Each filter consists of a filter unit and category for each dimension.The filter unit specifies a pattern (a regular expression) to match as the data stream isfiltered. The filter category is the system of measurement in which occurrences of that patternare counted or otherwise aggregated. Since filtering discards some of the data; incompleteregions within the MDB are created. The missing data complicates querying. While a queryon the filtered data can be automatically analysed to determine if sufficient information hasbeen filtered to satisfy it; a better query construction strategy is to prevent users fromformulating unsatisfiable queries. To aid users in formulating only satisfiable queries; the …,Proceedings of the ACM 14th international workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP,2011,4
Prefix-based node numbering for temporal XML,Curtis E Dyreson; Kalyan G Mekala,Abstract Prefix-based numbering (also called Dewey numbering; Dewey level order; ordynamic level numbering) is a popular method for numbering nodes in an XML data modelinstance. The nodes are numbered so that spatial relationships (eg; is a node a descendantof another) can be determined just from the numbers. In a temporal XML data collection thespatial relationships change over time as nodes are edited; deleted; and inserted. In thispaper we adapt prefix-based numbering to support the concise representation of items(elements that share the same identity over time) and versions (changes to an item overtime). We call our new numbering system time-tunneling dynamic level numbering (TTDLN).We show how to create; store; and update TTDLNs; and how they can be used to efficientlyevaluate sequenced and non-sequenced temporal queries.,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2011,4
Towards non-directional Xpath evaluation in a RDBMS,Sourav S Bhowmick; Curtis Dyreson; Erwin Leonardi; Zhifeng Ng,Abstract XML query languages use directional path expressions to locate data in an XMLdata collection. They are tightly coupled to the structure of a data collection; and can failwhen evaluated on the same data in a different structure. This paper extends pathexpressions with a new non-directional axis called the rank-distance axis. Given a contextnode and two positive integers α and β; the rank-distance axis returns those nodes that areranked between α and β in terms of closeness from the context node in any direction. Thispaper shows how to evaluate the rank-distance axis in a tree-unaware XML database. A tree-unaware implementation does not invade the database kernel to support XML queries;instead it uses an existing RDBMS such as Microsoft's SQL server as a back-end andprovides a front-end layer to translate XML queries to SQL.

The benefits of utilizing closeness in XML,Curtis Dyreson; Shuohao Zhang,Hierarchies are common in computer systems; from the XML data model in databasemanagement systems to file directories in operating systems. When a single hierarchy isimposed on data; a query becomes “brittle” in the sense that it might fail to produce thedesired result when executed on the same data organ-ized in a different hierarchy; when thehierarchy evolves to a slightly different hierarchy; or when a user misunderstands thehierarchy when constructing a query. A fixed hierarchy also makes it more difficult tointegrate heterogeneous data sources since each source could organize similar data in adifferent hier-archy. To address these concerns we propose tracking “closest relationships”in an XML data collection. These relationships can be used to create a commonrepresentation for data from different hierarchies and can be used to restructure data to …,Database and Expert Systems Application; 2008.

Grouping in MetaXQuery,Hao Jin; Curtis Dyreson,Abstract Metadata plays an important role in describing and proscribing data in bothtraditional and XML applications. In this paper; we present an extension of the XML datamodel and XQuery query language to support grouping of data and metadata. We focus inparticular on grouping because of its importance but lack of explicit support in querying andrestructuring XML. Typically elements that have the same data are grouped together; butwhen metadata is present; the metadata must also be evaluated to determine groupmembership.,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2004,4
Is that scene dangerous?: transferring knowledge over a video stream,Omar U Florez; Curtis Dyreson,Abstract Activity mining in traffic scenes aims to automatically explain the complexinteractions among moving objects recorded with a surveillance camera. Traditionalmachine learning algorithms generate a model and validate it with manually labeled data;which is a time-consuming and expensive task. The common issue is that these modelsoften get outdated when external variables take place during posterior recording such asdynamic background; illumination; and different weather conditions. Those changespractically impose a new domain that often makes the original model inaccurate forclustering and classification tasks. If we directly apply a statistical model trained in onedomain to other over the same stream; the performance of the algorithm will notablydecrease due to distinct activity representations and different marginal and conditional …,Proceedings of the 5th Ph.

Querying XML data: as you shape it,Curtis E Dyreson; Sourav S Bhowmick,A limitation of XQuery is that a programmer has to be familiar with the shape of the data toquery it effectively. And if that shape changes; or if the shape is other than what theprogrammer expects; the query may fail. One way to avoid this limitation is to transform thedata into a desired shape. A data transformation is a rearrangement of data into a newshape. In this paper; we present the semantics and implementation of XMorph 2.0; a shape-polymorphic data transformation language for XML. An XMorph program can act as a queryguard. The guard both transforms data to the shape needed by the query and determineswhether and how the transformation potentially loses information; a transformation that losesinformation may lead to a query yielding an inaccurate result.

Aquery in a shape polymorphic language adapts to the shape of the input; freeing the userfrom having to know the input's shape and making the query applicable to a wide variety ofdifferently shaped inputs. An XMorph query specifies the shape of the output. The XMorphquery engine transforms the input to the desired shape by shredding an XML document to agraph of closest relationships; and performing a closeness preserving transformation. Weplan to demonstrate XMorph using a Java applet; which can also be used by the audienceduring the demonstration; to evaluate various XMorph queries. The applet will show theoutput; the shapes generated by the query; and report on potential data loss in atransformation.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,3
Sublinear querying of realistic timeseries and its application to human motion,Omar U Florez; Alexander Ocsa; Curtis Dyreson,Abstract This paper introduces a novel hashing algorithm for large timeseries databases;which can improve the querying of human motion. Timeseries that represent human motioncome from many sources; in particular; videos and motion capture systems. Motion-relatedtimeseries have features which are not commonly present in traditional types of vector dataand that create additional indexing challenges: high and variable dimensionality; noEuclidean distance without normalization; and a metric space not fully defined. Newtechniques are needed to index motion-related timeseries. The algorithm that we present inthis paper generalizes the dot product operator to hash timeseries of variable dimensionalitywithout assuming constant dimensionality or requiring dimensionality normalization; unlikeother approaches. By avoiding normalization; our hashing algorithm preserves more …,Proceedings of the international conference on Multimedia information retrieval,2010,3
XMorph: a shape-polymorphic; domain-specific XML data transformation language,Curtis Dyreson; Sourav Bhowmick; Aswani Rao Jannu; Kirankanth Mallampalli; Shuohao Zhang,By imposing a single hierarchy on data; XML makes queries brittle in the sense that a querymight fail to produce the desired result if it is executed on the same data organized in adifferent hierarchy; or if the hierarchy evolves during the lifetime of an application. This paperpresents a new transformation language; called XMorph; which supports more flexiblequerying. XMorph is a shape polymorphic language; that is; a single XMorph query canextract and transform data from differently-shaped hierarchies. The XMorph data shredderdistills XML data into a graph of closest relationships; which are exploited by the queryevaluation engine to produce a result in the shape specified by an XMorph query.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,3
Towards Evaluation of Symmetric XPath Axis in Tree-Unaware RDBMS,Erwin Leonardi; S Bhowmick; Zhifeng Ng; Curtis Dyreson,With the rapid emergence of xml as the de facto standard for exchanging data on the Web;the interest in efficiently querying xml data sources using mature relational technology hasincreased. On the one hand; there has been a host of work; cf;[4; 8]; on enabling relationaldatabases to be tree-aware by invading the database kernel to support xml. On the otherhand; some completely jettison the invasive approach and resort to a tree-unawareapproach; cf;[3; 7; 9; 14; 15; 17]; where the database kernel is not modified to support xmlqueries. The tree-unaware approach reuses existing code; has a lower cost ofimplementation; and is more portable since it can be implemented on top of off-the-shelfrdbmss. However; due to the lack of statistics of tree structures in underlying relationalstorage schemes; the relational optimizer may generate inefficient query plans. This is …,*,2008,3
Pre-Aggregation for Irregular OLAP Hierarchies with the TreeScape System.,Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian S Jensen; Curtis E Dyreson,Abstract We present the TreeScape system which; unlike any other system known to theauthors; enables the reuse of pre-computed aggregate query results involving the kinds ofirregular dimension hierarchies that occur frequently in practice. The system establishes afoundation for obtaining high-performance query processing while precomputing only fewaggregates. It is demonstrated how this reuse of aggregates is enabled through dimensiontransformations that occur transparently to the user.,ICDE Demo Sessions,2001,3

Data-driven visual graph query interface construction and maintenance: challenges and opportunities,Sourav S Bhowmick; Byron Choi; Curtis Dyreson,Abstract Visual query interfaces make it easy for scientists and other nonexpert users toquery a data collection. Heretofore; visual query interfaces have been statically-constructed;independent of the data. In this paper we outline a vision of a different kind of interface; onethat is built (in part) from the data. In our data-driven approach; the visual interface isdynamically constructed and maintained. A data-driven approach has many benefits such asreducing the cost in constructing and maintaining an interface; superior support for queryformulation; and increased portability of the interface. We focus on graph databases; but ourapproach is applicable to several other kinds of databases such as JSON and XML.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,2
What to Reuse?: A Probabilistic Model to Transfer User Annotations in a Surveillance Video,Omar Florez; Curtis Dyreson; Junaith Shahabdeen,Techniques to extract or understand interactions between moving objects in video isbecoming increasingly important as the amount of video increases. Applications insurveillance range from understanding traffic to studying fish schooling behaviour. Becauseof the massive amount of data; fast; approximate techniques based on statistical models arecommon. These models connect user annotations (labels) to scenes in a (short) videosegment. The connection forms a domain; which associates information about movingobjects in scenes with the labels; such as to indicate whether a user considers a particulartraffic scene to be" dangerous." Unfortunately a statistical model trained in one domain oftenyields low precision and recall when applied to another domain because the randomvariables that explain video content exhibit changing marginal and conditional probability …,Computational Science and Engineering (CSE); 2013 IEEE 16th International Conference on,2013,2
Scalable similarity search of timeseries with variable dimensionality,Omar U Florez; Curtis Dyreson,Abstract Timeseries can be similar in shape but differ in length. For example; the soundwaves produced by the same word spoken twice have roughly the same shape; but one maybe shorter in duration. Stream data mining; approximate querying of image and videodatabases; data compression; and near duplicate detection are applications that need to beable to classify or cluster such timeseries; and to search for and rank timeseries that aresimilar to a chosen timeseries. We demonstrate software for clustering and performingsimilarity search in databases of timeseries data; where the timeseries have high andvariable dimensionality. Our demonstration uses Timeseries Sensitive Hashing (TSH)[3] toindex the timeseries. TSH adapts Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH); which is an approximatealgorithm to index data points in a d-dimensional space under some (eg; Euclidean) …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,2
Mining rules to explain activities in videos,Omar U Florez; Curtis Dyreson,Abstract We present a novel approach to mining dependency rules that explain the scenespresent during a video sequence. The approach first characterizes activities based on theirmost important events. Next; an HMM-based approach finds the mixture components thatbest describe the clustering dependencies between events and activities in video data. Thedependencies among activities are taken as association patterns with temporal precedenceand analyzed using their co-occurrence relationships in time windows. This technique ismeant to understand the multiple actions taken in a video or to predict future occurrences ofcertain activities.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,2
A Synthetic; Trend-Based Benchmark for XPath,Curtis Dyreson; Hao Jin,Abstract Interest in querying XML is increasing as it becomes an important medium for datarepresentation and exchange. A core component in most XML query languages is XPath.This paper describes a benchmark for comparing the performance of XPath queryevaluation engines. The benchmark consists of an XML document generator whichgenerates synthetic XML documents using a variety of benchmark-specific control factors.The benchmark also has a set of queries to compare XPath evaluation for each controlfactor. This paper reports on the performance of several; popular XPath query engines usingthe benchmark and draws some general inferences from the performance.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2009,2
Probability Distributions as Pre-Aggregated Data in Data Warehouses,Igor Timko; Curtis E Dyreson; Torben Bach Pedersen,Uncertainty is a very important aspect of business data analysis. For example; location-based services (LBSs); eg; traffic or tourist related services; generate massive amounts oflocation-based data that must be analyzed in order to optimize and personalize the services.The location-based data is inherently uncertain. For example; in a transportationinfrastructure; cars are moving dynamically; so the future location of a car is uncertain.Moreover; the current location is sometimes also uncertain (eg; known only to a wirelessphone cell). For the analysis; of particular interest are aggregation queries; eg;” For eachstreet in Pullman; WA; how many users (in their cars) are in the street?”. Current OLAP anddata warehouse (DW) technology [14; 16; 27] supports aggregation queries based on amultidimensional data model capturing hierarchies of dimensional data. However; the …,History,2005,2

Virtual eXist-db: liberating hierarchical queries from the shackles of access path dependence,Curtis E Dyreson; Sourav S Bhowmick; Ryan Grapp,Abstract XQuery programs can be hard to write and port to new data collections because thepath expressions in a query are dependent on the hierarchy of the data. We propose todemonstrate a system to liberate query writers from this dependence. A plug-and-play querycontains a specification of what data the query needs in order to evaluate. We implementedvirtual eXist-db to support plug-and-play XQuery queries. Our system adds a virtualDocfunction that lets a programmer sketch the hierarchy needed by the query; which may wellbe different than what the data has; and logically (not physically) transforms the data (withinformation loss guarantees) to the hierarchy specified by the virtualDoc. The demonstrationwill consist of a sequence of XQuery queries using a virtual hierarchy; including queriessuggested by the audience. We will also demonstrate a GUI tool to construct a virtual …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,1
One-scan rule extraction to explain significant vehicle interactions with guaranteed error value,Omar U Florez; Curtis Dyreson,Abstract Counting frequent itemsets allows us to compute the importance of items over astream of data. Translating this concept to video streams imposes the need of representingactivities as a sequence of activities over a video stream. In this paper; we present a modelto find approximate co-occurring associations between activities from video stream dataconsidering an unsupervised clustering of activities. We show that a hierarchical TopicModel of two stochastic processes is needed to jointly learn both an unknown number ofactivities in the video and the visual features that positively correlate for each activity. Unlikemost of previous works; we decouple the analysis of associations between multiple movingobjects from the discovery of activities. While the discovery of activities is an off-line processin which event distributions are grouped; the discovery of rules is an on-line process that …,ACM SIGAPP Applied Computing Review,2012,1
Discovering activity interactions in a single pass over a video stream,Omar U Florez; Curtis Dyreson,Abstract We propose a novel; unsupervised learning framework to find interactions ofactivities in streaming video data. In traditional streaming problems there is a prioriknowledge of the atomic elements in the stream. But in a video stream; the elements onlyemerge as activities of moving objects; and consequently must be learned or discovered inthe stream. This paper describes a two-stage framework that discovers activity interactions ina single pass over the stream. In the framework; activities are modeled as distributions overlow-level visual features and interactions as frequent co-occurrence relationships over thoseactivities. Off-line; similar low-level visual features are grouped into activities. On-line; co-occurring relationships caused by frequent activity interactions in the same scene arediscovered in the video stream. By decoupling the stages; we can incrementally learn …,Proceedings of the 27th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2012,1

Approximate retrieval of XML data with ApproXPath,Lin Xu; Curtis Dyreson,Abstract Several XML query languages have been proposed that use XPath expressions tolocate data. But XPath expressions might miss some data because of irregularities in thedata and schema of an XML data collection. In this paper we propose ApproXPath; whichsupports approximate path expressions. Approximate path expressions have the samesyntax as XPath expressions; but allow content and structural errors. An error is a string ortree edit operation that creates a (virtual) data collection in which the data can be located.ApproXPath extends XPath's axes; node tests and predicates to utilize the string/tree editdistance. We show that the complexity of ApproXPath is reasonable. For many queries; theinexact matching (with no errors) is as fast as exact matching; and the cost increases linearlywith the number of errors allowed.,Proceedings of the nineteenth conference on Australasian database-Volume 75,2008,1
Warp-edge optimization in XPath,Haiyun He; Curtis Dyreson,Abstract We describe the design and preliminary analysis of an optimization technique forXPath called warp-edge optimization. The XPath data model is a tree-like data model thathas an edge from an element to each component in the content of that element. The edgesare traversed in the evaluation of an XPath expression. A warp edge is an edge that issomething other than a parent to child edge; ie; an edge from an element to a sibling or to agrandchild. Warp edges can be dynamically generated and stored during query evaluationto improve the efficiency of future queries. We describe the implementation of warp-edgeoptimization as a layer on top of Xalan; the XPath evaluation engine from Apache.Experiments demonstrate that in the evaluation of some XPath expressions; the use of warpedges results in substantial savings of time.,International Conference on Object-Oriented Information Systems,2002,1
Content-based Navigation in a Mini-World Web,Curtis E Dyreson,Abstract Several database query languages have recently been developed to locate andretrieve documents in the vast network of World-Wide Web pages. These languagescombine path expressions; which specify the structure of a path through the network to thedesired information; with content predicates; which force the path to pass through pages withparticular content. The straightforward implementation of these languages is based onbreadth-rst search of the network; with heavy reliance placed on the user's understanding ofnetwork topology to both direct and constrain the search via the appropriate use of the pathexpressions. In this paper we describe a system that removes the reliance on pathexpressions to safeguard the search during a query and enables the user to navigate by rening content rather than by specifying structure. Our system uses a cost-constrained …,*,1997,1

ASTERIX: Ambiguity and Missing Element-Aware XML Keyword Search Engine,Ba Quan Truong; Sourav S Bhowmick; Curtis Dyreson; Hong Jing Khok,Abstract Despite a decade of research on XML keyword search (XKS); demonstration of ahigh quality XKS system has still eluded the information retrieval community. Existing XKSengines primarily suffer from two limitations. First; although the smallest lowest commonancestor (SLCA) algorithm (or a variant; eg; ELCA) is widely accepted as a meaningful wayto identify subtrees containing the query keywords; SLCA typically performs poorly ondocuments with missing elements; ie;(sub) elements that are optional; or appear in someinstances of an element type but not all. Second; since keyword search can be ambiguouswith multiple possible interpretations; it is desirable for an XKS engine to automaticallyexpand the original query by providing a classification of different possible interpretations ofthe query wrt the original results. However; existing XKS systems do not support such …,Proceedings of the 40th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,2017,*
VISUAL: Simulation of Visual Subgraph Query Formulation to Enable Automated Performance Benchmarking,Sourav S Bhowmick; Huey Eng Chua; Byron Choi; Curtis Dyreson,Visual graph interfaces improve the usability of graph databases by making it easier forusers to formulate queries.

Plug-and-Play Queries for Temporal Data Sockets,Curtis E Dyreson; Sourav S Bhowmick,Abstract Plug-and-play queries are portable; reliable; and easier to code. When a plug-and-play query is plugged into a data socket; the socket transforms the data to the shape neededby the query. If data is annotated with metadata; the semantics of the metadata potentiallyimpacts the transformation. In this paper we describe how to account for the metadata in atransformation. We focus on temporal metadata and show how a transformation canpreserve temporal semantics. We also show how the transformation can be driven by themetadata; for instance; the temporal metadata could be used to create data versions.,International Conference on Flexible Query Answering Systems,2017,*
The Value of Agricultural Voucher Specimens,Mary Barkworth; Paul Wolf; Sylvia Kinosian; Curtis Dyreson; Will Pearse; Ben Brandt; Neil Cobb,Abstract Voucher specimens are the ultimate raw data of biodiversity studies because theydocument the interpretation of the names used in papers and reports resulting from suchstudies.

Using CouchDB to Compute Temporal Aggregates,Curtis E Dyreson,Computing an aggregate on big data is a common application of mapreduce. The mapgroups values based on some key; and the reduce computes the aggregate for the group.But temporal data cannot be effectively grouped; so to compute a temporal aggregate; a newstrategy is needed. Temporal data is data annotated with time metadata; usually a temporalperiod representing the lifetime of the data in some time dimension. Since periods haveextent they are not directly amenable to grouping on some value-based key. The maincontribution of this paper is to show how temporal aggregates can be computed usingCouchDB (and by extension in other mapreduce systems). We introduce a new kind oftimestamp; which we call a log-segmented timestamp; and we show how to use thetimestamp to compute a temporal aggregate.

Translating Temporal SQL to Nested SQL,Curtis Dyreson; Venkata A Rani,This paper presents a technique for weaving temporal semantics into an SQL query. Weassume that a query writer programs a query and then annotates the query with sometemporal semantics; such as sequenced or nonsequenced semantics. The annotation is alightweight temporal statement modifier; it changes the semantics by which the query isevaluated. Annotations can be specified for a wide variety of semantics including sequencedand nonsequenced semantics. We give a denotational semantics for translating SQLqueries with temporal annotations into Nested SQL. Nested SQL is SQL with someadditional operations.

Thedatabase will grow over time as new versions are created; and its unrestrained growth willeventually exceed storage capacity. To become an autonomous; self-managing databasethis growth must be controlled by vacuuming versions of data; which reclaims space andprevents the data from exceeding storage capacity. Vacuuming policies specify whichversions to vacuum. This paper develops micro and macro vacuuming policies for an XMLdata collection.

In this paper we apply the aspect-oriented programming (AOP) paradigm to PigLatin; a dataflow language for cloud computing. Missing from Pig Latin is support for cross-cutting data concerns such as versioning; privacy; and reliability. AOP techniques can beused to weave metadata around Pig data. The metadata imbues the data with additionalsemantics that must be observed in the evaluation of Pig Latin programs. In this paper weshow to modify Pig Latin to process data woven together with metadata. The data weaver isa layer that maps a Pig Latin program to an augmented Pig Latin program using Pig Latintemplates or patterns.

Integrating Multiple Calendars using Zaman,Bedirhan Urgun; Curtis E Dyreson; Nick Kline; Jessica K Miller; Richard T Snodgrass; Michael D Soo; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Programmers world-wide are interested in developing applications that can beused internationally. Part of the internationalization effort is the ability to engineerapplications to use dates and times that conform to local calendars yet can inter-operate withdates and times in other calendars; for instance between the Gregorian and Islamiccalendars. Gzaman is a system that provides a natural language and calendar-independentframework for integrating multiple calendars. Gzaman performs “runtimebinding” ofcalendars and language support. A running Gzaman system dynamically loads calendarsand language support tables from XML-formatted files. Loading a calendar integrates it withother; already loaded calendars; enabling users of Gzaman to add; compare; and converttimes between multiple calendars. Gzaman also provides a flexible; calendar …,*,2004,*
A Jumping Spider to Index Concepts that Span Pages,Curtis E Dyreson,Abstract A search engine can index a concept that appears entirely on a single page. Butconcepts can span several pages. For instance; a page on trees may be linked to a page onlecture notes for a data structures course. If the trees page does not speci cally mentionlecture notes; then a search engine search for lecture notes on trees will; at best; onlypartially match each page. In this paper we describe a strategy to index concepts that spanmore than one page. Our strategy assumes that a multi-page concept is created by aconcept-path; consisting of some number of hyperlinks; that transits through pages withspeci c content. For instance; there must be a concept-path from the lecture notes page tothe trees page to create the lecture notes on trees concept.,*,1997,*

NORTH QUEENSLAND,Curtis Dyreson; Richard Snodgrass; Marshall Freiman,Abstract Granularity is an integral feature of temporal data. For instance; a person's age iscommonly given to the granularity of years and the time of their next airline ight to thegranularity of minutes. A granularity creates a discrete image; in terms of granules; of a(possibly continuous) time-line. Pairs of granularities are related in that some granularitiesare ner or coarser with respect to other granularities. A granularity graph records all therelationships between granularities; even among granularities in di erent calendars.Indeterminacy; or\don't know when" information; is a companion to granularity. A birthday;given to the granularity of days; does not reveal precisely when a person was born; only thatthey were born sometime during the indicated day. Temporal granularity and indeterminacyare two sides of the same coin; in that a time at a given granularity is indeterminate at all …,*,1995,*
A Second Example,Richard T Snodgrass; Christian S Jensen; Curtis E Dyreson; Wolfgang Käfer; Nick Kline; John F Roddick,Abstract This chapter expresses the schema and some of the queries of the extensiveconsensus test suite for temporal relational query languages [Jensen 1993]. The test suite isnot related to performance issues; but has a semantic focus and is intended to be an aid inevaluating the user-friendliness of temporal query languages. An attempt is made to expressthe schema and queries in TSQL2 in a convenient and natural fashion; as an informalevaluation of that language's user-friendliness.,*,1995,*
The MULTICAL Project,Michael D Soo; Richard Snodgrass; Curtis E Dyreson; Nick Kline,Abstract We describe in detail a system architecture for supporting a time-stamp attributedomain in conventional relational database management systems. This architectureunderlies previously proposed temporal modifications to SQL. We describe the majorcomponents of the system and how they interact. For each component of the system; weprovide specifications for the routines exported by that component. Finally; we describe apreliminary design for a toolkit that aids in the generation of the components of the databasemanagement system that support time.,*,1993,*

1 Patent Details,Torben Bach Pederseny; Christian S Jensenz,1.3 Abstract On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) based on a dimensional view of data isbeing used increasingly in traditional business applications as well as in applications suchas health care for the purpose of analyzing very large amounts of data. Pre-aggregation; theprior materialization of aggregate queries for later use; is an essential technique for ensuringadequate response time during data analysis. Full pre-aggregation; where all combinationsof aggregates are materialized; is infeasible. Instead; modern OLAP systems adopt thepractical pre-aggregation approach of materializing only select combinations of aggregatesand then re-use these for efficiently computing other aggregates. However; this re-use ofaggregates is contingent on the dimension hierarchies and the relationships between factsand dimensions satisfying stringent constraints.

Non-Directional XPath Processing in a Tree-Unaware RDBMS,Sourav S Bhowmick; Curtis Dyreson; Erwin Leonardi; Zhifeng Ng,A wealth of existing literature has extensively studied evaluation of various navigationalaxes in XPath expressions in a relational environment [9]. These wellstudied axes are alldirectional since they locate nodes in a fixed direction relative to a context node (eg; thedescendent axis corresponds to the “down” direction). Unfortunately; queries that rely ondirectional axes become dependent on the data being in the specified direction; eventhough data has no “natural” direction and can be organized in different hierarchies. Userswho are unfamiliar with a document structure or are knowledgeable about a structure whichsubsequently changes will sometimes formulate unsatisfiable queries; which are queriesthat fail to produce desired results. In contrast to incorrect queries; which result in acompilation error; unsatisfiable queries are difficult to debug since they run to completion …,*,*,*

Probabilistic Data Modeling and Querying for Location-Based Data Ware,Igor Timko; Curtis E Dyreson; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Motivated by the increasing need to handle complex; dynamic; uncertainmultidimensional data in location-based warehouses; this paper proposes a novelprobabilistic data model that can address the complexities of such data. The model providesa foundation for handling complex hierarchical and uncertain data; eg; data from the location-based services domain such as transportation infrastructures and the attached static anddynamic content such as speed limits and vehicle positions. The paper also presentsalgebraic operators that support querying of such data. Use of pre-aggregation forimplementation of the operators is also discussed. The work is motivated with a real-worldcase study; based on our collaboration with a leading Danish vendor of location-basedservices.,History,*,*
