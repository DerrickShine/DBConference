Brownian motion.,Peter Mörters; Yuval Peres,This eagerly awaited textbook covers everything the graduate student in probability wants toknow about Brownian motion; as well as the latest research in the area. Starting with theconstruction of Brownian motion; the book then proceeds to sample path properties likecontinuity and nowhere differentiability. Notions of fractal dimension are introduced earlyand are used throughout the book to describe fine properties of Brownian paths. The relationof Brownian motion and random walk is explored from several viewpoints; including adevelopment of the theory of Brownian local times from random walk embeddings.Stochastic integration is introduced as a tool and an accessible treatment of the potentialtheory of Brownian motion clears the path for an extensive treatment of intersections ofBrownian paths.

The universality classes in the parabolic Anderson model,Remco Van Der Hofstad; Wolfgang König; Peter Mörters,Abstract We discuss the long time behaviour of the parabolic Anderson model; the Cauchyproblem for the heat equation with random potential on Z^ d. We consider general iidpotentials and show that exactly four qualitatively different types of intermittent behaviourcan occur. These four universality classes depend on the upper tail of the potentialdistribution:(1) tails at∞ that are thicker than the double-exponential tails;(2) double-exponential tails at∞ studied by Gärtner and Molchanov;(3) a new class called almostbounded potentials; and (4) potentials bounded from above studied by Biskup and König.The new class (3); which contains both unbounded and bounded potentials; is studied inboth the annealed and the quenched setting. We show that intermittency occurs onunboundedly increasing islands whose diameter is slowly varying in time. The …,Communications in mathematical physics,2006,81

Random networks with sublinear preferential attachment: degree evolutions,Steffen Dereich; Peter Mörters,Abstract We define a dynamic model of random networks; where new vertices are connectedto old ones with a probability proportional to a sublinear function of their degree. We firstgive a strong limit law for the empirical degree distribution; and then have a closer look atthe temporal evolution of the degrees of individual vertices; which we describe in terms oflarge and moderate deviation principles. Using these results; we expose an interestingphase transition: in cases of strong preference of large degrees; eventually a single vertexemerges forever as vertex of maximal degree; whereas in cases of weak preference; thevertex of maximal degree is changing infinitely often. Loosely speaking; the transitionbetween the two phases occurs in the case when a new edge is attached to an existingvertex with a probability proportional to the root of its current degree.,Electronic Journal of Probability,2009,54
Brownian intersection local times: upper tail asymptotics and thick points,Wolfgang König; Peter Mörters,We equip the intersection of p independent Brownian paths in Rd; d≥ 2; with the naturalmeasure ℓ defined by projecting the intersection local time measure via one of the Brownianmotions onto the set of intersection points. Given a bounded domain we show that; as a↑∞;the probability of the event {l (U)> a} decays with an exponential rate of a1/pθ; where Θ isdescribed in terms of a variational problem. In the important special case when U is the unitball in R3 and p= 2; we characterize Θ in terms of an ordinary differential equation. We applyour results to the problem of finding the Hausdorff dimension spectrum for the thick points ofthe intersection of two independent Brownian paths in R3.,Annals of probability,2002,51
A two cities theorem for the parabolic Anderson model,Wolfgang König; Hubert Lacoin; Peter Mörters; Nadia Sidorova,Abstract The parabolic Anderson problem is the Cauchy problem for the heat equation∂ tu(t; z)= Δu (t; z)+ ξ (z) u (t; z) on (0;∞)× ℤ d with random potential (ξ (z): z∈ ℤ d). We considerindependent and identically distributed potentials; such that the distribution function of ξ (z)converges polynomially at infinity. If u is initially localized in the origin; that is; if $ u(0;{z})={\mathbh1} _ {0}({z}) $; we show that; as time goes to infinity; the solution iscompletely localized in two points almost surely and in one point with high probability. Wealso identify the asymptotic behavior of the concentration sites in terms of a weak limittheorem.,The Annals of Probability,2009,49
Weak and almost sure limits for the parabolic Anderson model with heavy tailed potentials,Remco Van Der Hofstad; Peter Mörters; Nadia Sidorova,Abstract We study the parabolic Anderson problem; that is; the heat equation∂ tu= Δu+ξu on(0;∞)× ℤ d with independent identically distributed random potential {ξ (z): z∈ ℤ d} andlocalized initial condition u (0; x)= 1 0 (x). Our interest is in the long-term behavior of therandom total mass U (t)=∑ zu (t; z) of the unique nonnegative solution in the case that thedistribution of ξ (0) is heavy tailed. For this; we study two paradigm cases of distributions withinfinite moment generating functions: the case of polynomial or Pareto tails; and the case ofstretched exponential or Weibull tails. In both cases we find asymptotic expansions for thelogarithm of the total mass up to the first random term; which we describe in terms of weaklimit theorems. In the case of polynomial tails; already the leading term in the expansion israndom. For stretched exponential tails; we observe random fluctuations in the almost …,The Annals of Applied Probability,2008,36
On the multifractal spectrum of the branching measure on a Galton–Watson tree,Peter Mörters; Narn-Rueih Shieh,Abstract Suppose that μ is the branching measure on the boundary of a supercritical Galton–Watson tree with offspring distribution N such that E [N log N]<∞ and P {N= 1}> 0. Wedetermine the multifractal spectrum of μ using a method different from that proposed byShieh and Taylor; which is flawed.,Journal of applied probability,2004,33
Ageing in the parabolic Anderson model,Peter Mörters; Marcel Ortgiese; Nadia Sidorova,Abstract. The parabolic Anderson model is the Cauchy problem for the heat equation with arandom potential. We consider this model in a setting which is continuous in time anddiscrete in space; and focus on time-constant; independent and identically distributedpotentials with polynomial tails at infinity. We are concerned with the long-term temporaldynamics of this system. Our main result is that the periods; in which the profile of thesolutions remains nearly constant; are increasing linearly over time; a phenomenon knownas ageing. We describe this phenomenon in the weak sense; by looking at the asymptoticprobability of a change in a given time window; and in the strong sense; by identifying thealmost sure upper envelope for the process of the time remaining until the next change ofprofile. We also prove functional scaling limit theorems for profile and growth rate of the …,Annales de l'Institut Henri Poincaré; Probabilités et Statistiques,2011,28
Large deviations of Markov chains indexed by random trees,Amir Dembo; Peter Mörters; Scott Sheffield,Abstract Given a finite typed rooted tree T with n vertices; the empirical subtree measure isthe uniform measure on the n typed subtrees of T formed by taking all descendants of asingle vertex. We prove a large deviation principle in n; with explicit rate function; for theempirical subtree measures of multitype Galton–Watson trees conditioned to have exactly nvertices. In the process; we extend the notions of shift-invariance and specific relativeentropy—as typically understood for Markov fields on deterministic graphs such as Z d—toMarkov fields on random trees. We also develop single-generation empirical measure largedeviation principles for a more general class of random trees including trees sampleduniformly from the set of all trees with n vertices.,Annales de l'Institut Henri Poincare (B) Probability and Statistics,2005,28
Spatial preferential attachment networks: Power laws and clustering coefficients,Emmanuel Jacob; Peter Mörters,Abstract We define a class of growing networks in which new nodes are given a spatialposition and are connected to existing nodes with a probability mechanism favoring shortdistances and high degrees. The competition of preferential attachment and spatialclustering gives this model a range of interesting properties. Empirical degree distributionsconverge to a limit law; which can be a power law with any exponent $\tau> 2$. The averageclustering coefficient of the networks converges to a positive limit. Finally; a phase transitionoccurs in the global clustering coefficients and empirical distribution of edge lengths whenthe power-law exponent crosses the critical value $\tau= 3$. Our main tool in the proof ofthese results is a general weak law of large numbers in the spirit of Penrose and Yukich.,The Annals of Applied Probability,2015,27
Upper tails for intersection local times of random walks in supercritical dimensions,Xia Chen; Peter Mörters,Abstract We determine the precise asymptotics of the logarithmic upper tail probability of thetotal intersection local time of p independent random walks in Zd under the assumption p(d −2) > d. Our approach allows a direct treatment of the infinite time horizon … Quantities measuringthe amount of self-intersection of a random walk; or of mutual intersection of several independentrandom walks; have been studied intensively for more than 20 years (see; for example; [3; 4;9; 14; 15; 17]). This research is often motivated by the rôle these quantities play in quantum fieldtheory (see; for example; [6]); in our understanding of self-avoiding walks and polymer models(see; for example; [16]); or in the analysis of stochastic processes in random environments(see; for example; [1; 7; 8; 11]). In the latter models dependence between a moving particle anda random environment frequently comes from the particle's ability to revisit sites with an …,Journal of the London Mathematical Society,2009,27
Thin and thick points for branching measure on a Galton–Watson tree,Peter Mörters; Narn-Rueih Shieh,Abstract Suppose that μ is the branching measure on the boundary of a supercritical Galton–Watson tree with offspring distribution N such that E [N log+ N]<∞. We determine thedimension spectrum of thin points under the condition P {N⩽ 1}= 0 and the dimensionspectrum of thick points under the condition that either 0< sup {t: E [exp (tN)]<∞}<∞ or esssup N<∞. Our main tool for obtaining lower bounds is to study percolation on the Galton–Watson tree.,Statistics & probability letters,2002,26
The finite dimensional attractor for a 4th order system of Cahn-Hilliard type with a supercritical nonlinearity,MA Efendiev; Herbert Gajewski; S Zelik,Abstract This article is devoted to the study of the long-time behavior of solutions of thefollowing 4th order parabolic system in a bounded smooth domain $\Omega\subset\subset{\mathbb R}^ n $: $ $ b\partial_t u=-{\Delta_x}(a {\Delta_x} u-\alpha\partial_t uf (u)+\tildeg)\;;\tag*{(1)} $ $ where $ u=(u^ 1;\cdots; u^ k) $ is an unknown vector-valued function; $ a $and $ b $ are given constant matrices such that $ a+ a^*> 0$; $ b= b^*> 0$; $\alpha> 0$ is apositive number; and $ f $ and $ g $ are given functions. Note that the nonlinearity $ f $ is notassumed to be subordinated to the Laplacian. The existence of a finite dimensional globalattractor for system (1) is proved under some natural assumptions on the nonlinear term $ f$.,Advances in Differential Equations,2002,26
Tangent measure distributions of fractal measures,Peter Mörters; David Preiss,Abstract. Tangent measure distributions provide a natural tool to study the local geometry offractal sets and measures in Euclidean spaces. The idea is; loosely speaking; to attach toevery point of the set a family of random measures; called the α-dimensional tangentmeasure distributions at the point; which describe asymptotically the α-dimensional sceneryseen by an observer zooming down towards this point. This tool has been used by Bandt BAand Graf G to study the regularity of the local geometry of self similar sets; but in this paperwe show that its scope goes much beyond this situation and; in fact; it may be used todescribe a strong regularity property possessed by every measure: We show that; for everymeasure μ on a Euclidean space and any dimension α; at μ-almost every point; all α-dimensional tangent measure distributions are Palm measures. This means that the local …,Mathematische Annalen,1998,25
Random networks with sublinear preferential attachment: the giant component,Steffen Dereich; Peter Mörters,Abstract We study a dynamical random network model in which at every construction step anew vertex is introduced and attached to every existing vertex independently with aprobability proportional to a concave function $ f $ of its current degree. We give a criterionfor the existence of a giant component; which is both necessary and sufficient; and whichbecomes explicit when $ f $ is linear. Otherwise it allows the derivation of explicit necessaryand sufficient conditions; which are often fairly close. We give an explicit criterion to decidewhether the giant component is robust under random removal of edges. We also determineasymptotically the size of the giant component and the empirical distribution of componentsizes in terms of the survival probability and size distribution of a multitype branchingrandom walk associated with $ f $.,Annals of Probabiltiy,2013,24
The multifractal spectrum of Brownian intersection local times,Achim Klenke; Peter Mörters,Abstract Let ℓ be the projected intersection local time of two independent Brownian paths inℝ d for d= 2; 3. We determine the lower tail of the random variable $\ell (\mathbb {U}) $;where $\mathbb {U} $ is the unit ball. The answer is given in terms of intersection exponents;which are explicitly known in the case of planar Brownian motion. We use this result toobtain the multifractal spectrum; or spectrum of thin points; for the intersection local times.,The Annals of Probability,2005,21

The parabolic Anderson model with heavy-tailed potential,Peter Mörters,Abstract. The parabolic Anderson model is the Cauchy problem for the heat equation withrandom potential. It offers a case study for the effects that a random; or irregular;environment can have on a diffusion process. The main focus in the present survey is onphenomena that are due to a highly irregular potential; which we model by a spatiallyindependent; identically distributed random field with heavy tails. Among the effects wediscuss are random fluctuations in the growth of the total mass; localisation in the weak andalmost sure sense; and ageing.,Surveys in Stochastic Processes; Proceedings of the 33rd SPA Conference in Berlin,2009,19
A set with finite curvature and projections of zero length,Helen Joyce; Peter Mörters,A compact subset E of the complex plane is called removable if all bounded analyticfunctions on its complement are constant or; equivalently; if its analytic capacity vanishes.The problem of finding a geometric characterization of the removable sets is more than ahundred years old and still not completely solved (see [5] for an introduction and [7] for arecent survey). However; there has been enormous progress in the last couple of years andthis is to a large extent due to the introduction of the notion of the curvature of a set byMelnikov in [10]. We say that a compact subset E of the plane has finite (Melnikov) curvatureif there is a nonzero measure μ supported by E; such that μ (B)<\B\for every closed ball B ofdiameter\B\and such that c2 (μ)= Çe Çe Çe 1,*,1999,19
Large deviation principles for empirical measures of colored random graphs,Kwabena Doku-Amponsah; Peter Mörters,Abstract For any finite colored graph we define the empirical neighborhood measure; whichcounts the number of vertices of a given color connected to a given number of vertices ofeach color; and the empirical pair measure; which counts the number of edges connectingeach pair of colors. For a class of models of sparse colored random graphs; we prove largedeviation principles for these empirical measures in the weak topology. The rate functionsgoverning our large deviation principles can be expressed explicitly in terms of relativeentropies. We derive a large deviation principle for the degree distribution of Erdős–Rényigraphs near criticality.,The annals of Applied Probability,2010,18
Typical distances in ultrasmall random networks,Steffen Dereich; Christian Mönch; Peter Mörters,Abstract We show that in preferential attachment models with power-law exponent τ∈(2; 3)the distance between randomly chosen vertices in the giant component is asymptoticallyequal to (4+ o (1)) log log N/(-log (τ− 2)); where N denotes the number of nodes. This is twicethe value obtained for the configuration model with the same power-law exponent. The extrafactor reveals the different structure of typical shortest paths in preferential attachmentgraphs.,Advances in Applied Probability,2012,17
A scaling limit theorem for the parabolic Anderson model with exponential potential,Hubert Lacoin; Peter Mörters,Abstract The parabolic Anderson problem is the Cauchy problem for the heat equation withrandom potential and localized initial condition. In this paper; we consider potentials whichare constant in time and independent exponentially distributed in space. We study thegrowth rate of the total mass of the solution in terms of weak and almost sure limit theorems;and the spatial spread of the mass in terms of a scaling limit theorem. The latter result showsthat in this case; just like in the case of heavy tailed potentials; the mass gets trapped in asingle relevant island with high probability.,*,2012,17
Random networks with concave preferential attachment rule,Steffen Dereich; Peter Mörters,Abstract Many of the phenomena in the complex world in which we live have a roughdescription as a large network of interacting components. Random network theory tries todescribe the global structure of such networks from basic local principles. One such principleis the preferential attachment paradigm which suggests that networks are built by addingnodes and links successively; in such a way that new nodes prefer to be connected toexisting nodes if they have a high degree. Our research gives the first comprehensive andmathematically rigorous treatment of the case when this preference follows a nonlinear; ormore precisely concave; rule. We survey results obtained so far and some ongoingdevelopments.,Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung,2011,17
Minimal supporting subtrees for the free energy of polymers on disordered trees,Peter Mörters; Marcel Ortgiese,We consider a model of directed polymers on a regular tree with a disorder given byindependent; identically distributed weights attached to the vertices. For suitable weightdistributions this model undergoes a phase transition with respect to its localizationbehavior. We show that; for high temperatures; the free energy is supported by a randomtree of positive exponential growth rate; which is strictly smaller than that of the full tree. Thegrowth rate of the minimal supporting subtree decreases to zero as the temperaturedecreases to the critical value. At the critical value and all lower temperatures; a singlepolymer suffices to support the free energy. Our proofs rely on elegant martingale methodsadapted from the theory of branching random walks.,Journal of Mathematical Physics,2008,16
Moderate deviations for a random walk in random scenery,Klaus Fleischmann; Peter Mörters; Vitali Wachtel,Abstract We investigate the cumulative scenery process associated with random walks inindependent; identically distributed random sceneries under the assumption that thescenery variables satisfy Cramér's condition. We prove moderate deviation principles indimensions d≥ 2; covering all those regimes where rate and speed do not depend on theactual distribution of the scenery. For the case d≥ 4 we even obtain precise asymptotics forthe probability of a moderate deviation; extending a classical central limit theorem of Kestenand Spitzer. For d≥ 3; an important ingredient in the proofs are new concentrationinequalities for self-intersection local times of random walks; which are of independentinterest; whilst for d= 2 we use a recent moderate deviation result for self-intersection localtimes; which is due to Bass; Chen and Rosen.,Stochastic Processes and their Applications,2008,16
Unbiased shifts of Brownian motion,Günter Last; Peter Mörters; Hermann Thorisson,Abstract Let $ B=(B_ {t}) _ {t\in\mathbb {R}} $ be a two-sided standard Brownian motion. Anunbiased shift of $ B $ is a random time $ T $; which is a measurable function of $ B $; suchthat $(B_ {T+ t}-B_ {T}) _ {t\in\mathbb {R}} $ is a Brownian motion independent of $ B_ {T} $.We characterise unbiased shifts in terms of allocation rules balancing mixtures of local timesof $ B $. For any probability distribution $\nu $ on $\mathbb {R} $ we construct a stoppingtime $ T\ge0 $ with the above properties such that $ B_ {T} $ has distribution $\nu $. We alsostudy moment and minimality properties of unbiased shifts. A crucial ingredient of ourapproach is a new theorem on the existence of allocation rules balancing stationary diffuserandom measures on $\mathbb {R} $. Another new result is an analogue for diffuse randommeasures on $\mathbb {R} $ of the cycle-stationarity characterisation of Palm versions of …,The Annals of Probability,2014,15

Phase transitions for dilute particle systems with Lennard-Jones potential,Andrea Collevecchio; Wolfgang König; Peter Mörters; Nadia Sidorova,Abstract We consider a classical dilute particle system in a large box with pair-interactiongiven by a Lennard-Jones-type potential. The inverse temperature is picked proportionally tothe logarithm of the particle density. We identify the free energy per particle in terms of avariational formula and show that this formula exhibits a cascade of phase transitions as thetemperature parameter ranges from zero to infinity. Loosely speaking; the particle systemseparates into spatially distant components in such a way that within each phase allcomponents are of the same size; which is the larger the lower the temperature. The maintool in our proof is a new large deviation principle for sparse point configurations.,Communications in Mathematical Physics,2010,14

Vulnerability of robust preferential attachment networks,Maren Eckhoff; Peter Mörters,Abstract Scale-free networks with small power law exponent are known to be robust;meaning that their qualitative topological structure cannot be altered by random removal ofeven a large proportion of nodes. By contrast; it has been argued in the science literaturethat such networks are highly vulnerable to a targeted attack; and removing a small numberof key nodes in the network will dramatically change the topological structure. Here weanalyse a class of preferential attachment networks in the robust regime and prove four mainresults supporting this claim: After removal of an arbitrarily small proportion ϵ> 0 of theoldest nodes (1) the asymptotic degree distribution has exponential instead of power lawtails;(2) the largest degree in the network drops from being of the order of a power of thenetwork size n to being just logarithmic in n;(3) the typical distances in the network …,Electronic Journal of Probability,2014,12
A spatial preferential attachment model with local clustering,Emmanuel Jacob; Peter Mörters,Abstract A class of growing networks is introduced in which new nodes are given a spatialposition and are connected to existing nodes with a probability mechanism favouring shortdistances and high degrees. The competition of preferential attachment and spatialclustering gives this model a range of interesting properties. Most notably; empirical degreedistributions converge to a limit law; which can be a power law with any exponent τ> 2; andthe average clustering coefficient converges to a positive limit. Our main tool to show theseand other results is a weak law of large numbers in the spirit of Penrose and Yukich; whichcan be applied thanks to a novel rescaling idea. We also conjecture that the networks havea robust giant component if τ is sufficiently small.,International Workshop on Algorithms and Models for the Web-Graph,2013,12
Galton–Watson trees with vanishing martingale limit,Nathanaël Berestycki; Nina Gantert; Peter Mörters; Nadia Sidorova,Abstract We show that an infinite Galton–Watson tree; conditioned on its martingale limitbeing smaller than ε ε; agrees up to generation KK with a regular μ μ-ary tree; where μ μ isthe essential minimum of the offspring distribution and the random variable KK is stronglyconcentrated near an explicit deterministic function growing like a multiple of\log (1/ε) log(1/ε). More precisely; we show that if μ ≥ 2 μ≥ 2 then with high probability; as ε ↓ 0 ε↓ 0;KK takes exactly one or two values. This shows in particular that the conditioned treesconverge to the regular μ μ-ary tree; providing an example of entropic repulsion where thelimit has vanishing entropy. Our proofs are based on recent results on the left tail behaviourof the martingale limit obtained by Fleischmann and Wachtel 11.,Journal of Statistical Physics,2014,11
Emergence of condensation in Kingman’s model of selection and mutation,Steffen Dereich; Peter Mörters,Abstract We describe the onset of condensation in the simple model for the balancebetween selection and mutation given by Kingman in terms of a scaling limit theorem.Loosely speaking; this shows that the wave moving towards genes of maximal fitness hasthe shape of a gamma distribution. We conjecture that this wave shape is a universalphenomenon that can also be found in a variety of more complex models; well beyond thegenetics context; and provide some further evidence for this.,Acta applicandae mathematicae,2013,11
Small value probabilities via the branching tree heuristic,Peter Mörters; Marcel Ortgiese,Abstract In the first part of this paper; we give easy and intuitive proofs for the small valueprobabilities of the martingale limit of a supercritical Galton–Watson process in both theSchröder and the Böttcher cases. These results are well known; but the most cited proofsrely on generating function arguments which are hard to transfer to other settings. In thesecond part; we show that the strategy underlying our proofs can be used in the quitedifferent context of self-intersections of stochastic processes. Solving a problem posed byWenbo Li; we find the small value probabilities for intersection local times of severalBrownian motions; as well as for self-intersection local times of a single Brownian motion.,Bernoulli,2008,11

Strong clumping of super-Brownian motion in a stable catalytic medium,Donald A Dawson; Klaus Fleischmann; Peter Mörters,A typical feature of the long time behavior of continuous super-Brownian motion in a stablecatalytic medium is the development of large mass clumps (or clusters) at spatially rare sites.We describe this phenomenon by means of a functional limit theorem under renormalization.The limiting process is a Poisson point field of mass clumps with no spatial motioncomponent and with infinite variance. The mass of each cluster evolves independentlyaccording to a non-Markovian continuous process trapped at mass zero; which we describeexplicitly by means of a Brownian snake construction in a random medium. We alsodetermine the survival probability and asymptotic size of the clumps.,Annals of probability,2002,8

In this setting eachparticle of super-Brownianmotion alive at time t is represented by apath w:[0; t]→ ℝ d and the state of historical super-Brownian motionis a measure on the set of paths. Typical particles have Brownian paths;however in the uncountable collection of particles in the range of asuper-Brownian motionthere are some which at exceptional times movefaster than Brownian motion. We determinethe maximal speed of allparticles during a given time period E; which turns out to beafunction of the packing dimension of E. A path w in the support ofhistorical super-Brownianmotion at time t is called a-fast if.

The exact packing measure of Brownian double points,Peter Mörters; Narn-Rueih Shieh,Abstract Let D ⊂ R^ 3 be the set of double points of a three-dimensional Brownian motion.We show that; if ξ= ξ 3 (2; 2) is the intersection exponent of two packets of two independentBrownian motions; then almost surely; the ϕ-packing measure of D is zero if 0^+ r^-1-ξ ϕ (r)^ξ\; dr< ∞; and infinity otherwise. As an important step in the proof we show up-to-constantsestimates for the tail at zero of Brownian intersection local times in dimensions two andthree.,Probability Theory and Related Fields,2009,7
Brownian intersection local times: Exponential moments and law of large masses,Wolfgang König; Peter Mörters,1.1. Introduction. Much of our knowledge about Brownian occupation times goes back to thecelebrated Feynman-Kac formula; see eg [Fe48; Ka49] for original sources and [FP99] for anexcellent survey. The formula is also at the heart of results relating Brownian motion and a vastnumber of differential equations; see [BS02] for an impressive account. To formulate one of manyversions of the Feynman-Kac formula; let B ⊂ Rd be a bounded open domain and suppose thatW is a Brownian motion started in x ∈ B. Let q: B → [0; ∞) be a Borel measurable function andlet T be the first exit time of the Brownian motion W from B. Then the function f : B → [0; ∞] givenby … 0 q(W(s)) ds ] ; for x ∈ B … (1.2) f(x)=1+ ∫ G(x; y)f(y)q(y) dy … Received by the editorsAugust 13; 2003 and; in revised form; May 4; 2004. 2000 Mathematics SubjectClassification.

An efficient stochastic chemistry approximation for the PDF transport equation,Markus Kraft; Wolfgang Wagner,Abstract In this paper we present an efficient algorithm for the numerical treatment of thePDF transport equation. Using the partially stirred plug flow model in conjunction with theIEM mixing model we construct a numerical scheme that is based on a time splittingtechnique and a stochastic chemistry approximation. For this purpose a particle/sub-particlesystem is introduced. The dynamics of this particle system is determined by a mixing stepand a chemistry step. The chemistry step is solved by a jump process where forward andreverse reactions are combined. Various numerical experiments are carried out to studyconvergence with respect to particle number and sub-particle number. In case of a linearreaction; the comparison between analytical solution and numerical approximation of thethird moment reveals that the systematic error is inversely proportional to the number of …,*,2005,7

Nonextensive condensation in reinforced branching processes,Steffen Dereich; Cécile Mailler; Peter Mörters,Abstract We study a class of branching processes in which a population consists of immortalindividuals equipped with a fitness value. Individuals produce offspring with a rate given bytheir fitness; and offspring may either belong to the same family; sharing the fitness of theirparent; or be founders of new families; with a fitness sampled from a fitness distribution $\mu$. Examples that can be embedded in this class are stochastic house-of-cards models; urnmodels with reinforcement and the preferential attachment tree of Bianconi and Barabási.Our focus is on the case when the fitness distribution $\mu $ has bounded support andregularly varying tail at the essential supremum. In this case; there exists a condensationphase; in which asymptotically a proportion of mass in the empirical fitness distribution of theoverall population condenses in the maximal fitness value.

Robustness of scale-free spatial networks,Emmanuel Jacob; Peter Morters,Abstract A growing family of random graphs is called robust if it retains a giant componentafter percolation with arbitrary positive retention probability. We study robustness for graphs;in which new vertices are given a spatial position on the $ d $-dimensional torus and areconnected to existing vertices with a probability favouring short spatial distances and highdegrees. In this model of a scale-free network with clustering; we can independently tune thepower law exponent $\tau $ of the degree distribution and the rate $-\delta d $ at which theconnection probability decreases with the distance of two vertices. We show that the networkis robust if $\tau< 2+\frac {1}{\delta} $; but fails to be robust if $\tau> 3$. In the case of one-dimensional space; we also show that the network is not robust if $\tau> 2+\frac {1}{\delta-1}$. This implies that robustness of a scale-free network depends not only on its power-law …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00618,2015,5

We show that the conditioned paths grow of order n α; where α=(p−β)/(p− 1); and also prove a coarse large deviation principle for the order of growth.,Journal of Statistical Physics,2008,5
Post-gelation behavior of a spatial coagulation model,Wolfgang Wagner,Abstract A coagulation model on a finite spatial grid is considered. Particles of discretemasses jump randomly between sites and; while located at the same site; stick togetheraccording to some coagulation kernel. The asymptotic behavior (for increasing particlenumbers) of this model is studied in the situation when the coagulation kernel growssufficiently fast so that the phenomenon of gelation is observed. Weak accumulation pointsof an appropriate sequence of measure-valued processes are characterized in terms ofsolutions of a nonlinear equation. A natural description of the behavior of the gel is obtainedby using the onepoint compactification of the size space. Two aspects of the limitingequation are of special interest. First; for a certain class of coagulation kernels; this equationdiffers from a naive extension of Smoluchowski's coagulation equation. Second; due to …,Electronic Journal of Probability,2006,5

Cycle length distributions in random permutations with diverging cycle weights,Steffen Dereich; Peter Mörters,Abstract We study the model of random permutations with diverging cycle weights; whichwas recently considered by Ercolani and Ueltschi; and others. Assuming only regularvariation of the cycle weights we obtain a very precise local limit theorem for the size of atypical cycle; and use this to show that the empirical distribution of properly rescaled cyclelengths converges in probability to a gamma distribution.

Complete localisation in the parabolic Anderson model with Pareto-distributed potential,Wolfgang Konig; Peter Morters; Nadia Sidorova,Abstract: The parabolic Anderson problem is the Cauchy problem for the heat equation$\partial_t u (t; z)=\Delta u (t; z)+\xi (z) u (t; z) $ on $(0;\infty)\times {\mathbb Z}^ d $ withrandom potential $(\xi (z)\colon z\in {\mathbb Z}^ d) $. We consider independent andidentically distributed potential variables; such that Prob $(\xi (z)> x) $ decays polynomiallyas $ x\uparrow\infty $. If $ u $ is initially localised in the origin; ie if $ u (0; x)=\one_0 (x) $; weshow that; at any large time $ t $; the solution is completely localised in a single point withhigh probability. More precisely; we find a random process $(Z_t\colon t\ge 0) $ with valuesin $\Z^ d $ such that $\lim_ {t\uparrow\infty} u (t; Z_t)/\sum_ {z\in\Z^ d} u (t; z)= 1; $ inprobability.

The Semi-infinite Asymmetric Exclusion Process: Large Deviations via Matrix Products,Horacio González Duhart; Peter Mörters; Johannes Zimmer,Abstract We study the totally asymmetric exclusion process on the positive integers with asingle particle source at the origin. Liggett (Trans. Am. Math.

Simultaneous multifractal analysis of the branching and visibility measure on a Galton-Watson tree,Adam L Kinnison; Peter Mörters,Abstract On the boundary of a Galton-Watson tree we can define the visibility measure bysplitting mass equally between the children of each vertex; and the branching measure bysplitting unit mass equally between all vertices in the n th generation and then letting n go toinfinity. The multifractal structure of each of these measures is well studied. In this paper weaddress the question of a joint multifractal spectrum; ie we ask for the Hausdorff dimensionof the boundary points which simultaneously have an unusual local dimension for boththese measures. The resulting two-parameter spectrum exhibits a number of surprising newfeatures; among them the emergence of a swallowtail-shaped spectrum for the visibilitymeasure in the presence of a nontrivial condition on the branching measure.,Advances in Applied Probability,2010,2

Random fractals,Peter Mörters,The term fractal usually refers to sets which; in some sense; have a self-similar structure.Already in the seventies of the last century Mandelbrot (1982) made a compelling case forthe importance of this concept in mathematical modelling. Indeed; some form of self-similarity is common in random sets; in particular those arising from stochastic processes.Therefore studying fractal aspects is an important feature of modern stochastic geometry.Early progress in fractal geometry often referred to sets with obvious selfsimilarity; like thefixed points of iterated function systems. These are toy examples; tailor-made to study self-similarity in its tidiest form. An overview of the achievements in this period can be obtainedfrom (Falconer; 2003).,NEW PERSPECTIVES IN STOCHACTIC GEOMETRY; EDITED WILFRID KENDALL & ILYA MOLCHANOV,2009,2

Near critical preferential attachment networks have small giant components,Maren Eckhoff; Peter Morters; Marcel Ortgiese,Abstract: Preferential attachment networks with power law exponent $\tau> 3$ are known toexhibit a phase transition. There is a value $\rho_ {\rm c}> 0$ such that; for small edgedensities $\rho\leq\rho_c $ every component of the graph comprises an asymptoticallyvanishing proportion of vertices; while for large edge densities $\rho>\rho_c $ there is aunique giant component comprising an asymptotically positive proportion of vertices. In thispaper we study the decay in the size of the giant component as the critical edge density isapproached from above. We show that the size decays very rapidly; like $\exp (-c/\sqrt {\rho-\rho_c}) $ for an explicit constant $ c> 0$ depending on the model implementation. Thisresult is in contrast to the behaviour of the class of rank-one models of scale-free networks;including the configuration model; where the decay is polynomial.

The contact process on scale-free networks evolving by vertex updating,Emmanuel Jacob; Peter Mörters,We study the contact process on a class of evolving scale-free networks; where each nodeupdates its connections at independent random times. We give a rigorous mathematicalproof that there is a transition between a phase where for all infection rates the infectionsurvives for a long time; at least exponential in the network size; and a phase where forsufficiently small infection rates extinction occurs quickly; at most polynomially in the networksize. The phase transition occurs when the power-law exponent crosses the value four. Thisbehaviour is in contrast with that of the contact process on the corresponding static model;where there is no phase transition; as well as that of a classical mean-field approximation;which has a phase transition at power-law exponent three. The new observation behind ourresult is that temporal variability of networks can simultaneously increase the rate at …,Royal Society open science,2017,1
Optimal embeddings by unbiased shifts of Brownian motion,Peter Mörters; István Redl,Abstract An unbiased shift of the two-sided Brownian motion (Bt: t∈ R) is a random time Tsuch that (BT+ t: t∈ R) is still a two-sided Brownian motion. Given a pair μ; ν of orthogonalprobability measures; an unbiased shift T solves the embedding problem; if B0∼ μ impliesBT∼ ν. A solution to this problem was given by Last et al.(2014); based on earlier work ofBertoin and Le Jan (1992); and Holroyd and Liggett (2001). In this note we show that thissolution minimises Eψ (T) over all non-negative unbiased solutions T; simultaneously for allnon-negative; concave functions ψ. Our proof is based on a discrete concavity inequality thatmay be of independent interest.,Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society,2017,1

We argue that this result is in linewith predictions arising from the classification of homogeneous fragmentation processes aslogarithmically correlated random fields.,Journal of Statistical Physics,2017,1
Distances in scale free networks at criticality,Steffen Dereich; Christian Mönch; Peter Mörters,Abstract Scale-free networks with moderate edge dependence experience a phasetransition between ultrasmall and small world behaviour when the power law exponentpasses the critical value of three. Moreover; there are laws of large numbers for the graphdistance of two randomly chosen vertices in the giant component. When the degreedistribution follows a pure power law these show the same asymptotic distances of $\frac{\log N}{\log\log N} $ at the critical value three; but in the ultrasmall regime reveal adifference of a factor two between the most-studied rank-one and preferential attachmentmodel classes. In this paper we identify the critical window where this factor emerges. Welook at models from both classes when the asymptotic proportion of vertices with degree atleast $ k $ scales like $ k^{-2}(\log k)^{2\alpha+ o (1)} $ and show that for preferential …,Electronic Journal of Probability,2017,1
Condensation and symmetry-breaking in the zero-range process with weak site disorder,Cécile Mailler; Peter Mörters; Daniel Ueltschi,Abstract Condensation phenomena in particle systems typically occur as one of two distincttypes: either as a spontaneous symmetry breaking in a homogeneous system; in whichparticle interactions enforce condensation in a randomly located site; or as an explicitsymmetry breaking in a system with background disorder; in which particles condensate inthe site of extremal disorder. In this paper we confirm a recent conjecture by Godrèche andLuck by showing; for a zero range process with weak site disorder; that there exists a phasewhere condensation occurs with an intermediate type of symmetry-breaking; in whichparticles condensate in a site randomly chosen from a range of sites favoured by disorder.We show that this type of condensation is characterised by the occurrence of a Gammadistribution in the law of the disorder at the condensation site.

We give a necessaryand sufficient criterion for the existence of a non-randomized time T such that (X_ T+ n: n ∈Z)(XT+ n: n∈ Z) has the law of the same Markov chain with initial distribution ν ν. In the casewhen our criterion is satisfied we give an explicit solution; which is also a stopping time; andstudy its moment properties. We show that this solution minimizes the expectation of ψ (T) ψ(T) in the class of all non-negative solutions; simultaneously for all non-negative concavefunctions ψ ψ.,Probability Theory and Related Fields,2016,1

Intersection exponents and the multifractal spectrum for measures on Brownian paths,Peter Mörters,Abstract The aim of this paper is to give a survey of recent developments in the multifractalanalysis of measures arising in the study of Brownian motion. We first discuss the harmonicmeasure on a Brownian path; studied by Lawler; and the intersection local time on theintersection of two independent Brownian paths; studied by Klenke and Morters. In bothexamples the intersection exponents of Brownian motion play a crucial role in themultifractal analysis. Whereas the first example is in line with the multifractal formalism; thesecond example is not and more subtle effects come into the picture. Then we discuss theoccupation measure of Brownian motion; in which case a refined multifractal analysis wascarried out by Dembo; Peres; Rosen and Zeitouni.,*,2004,1

In the process; we extend the notions of shift-invariance and specific relativeentropy—as typically understood for Markov fields on deterministic graphs such as Z d—toMarkov fields on random trees. We also develop single-generation empirical measure largedeviation principles for a more general class of random trees including trees sampleduniformly from the set of all trees with n vertices.,*,2003,1

In the limit of large sparse networks; the model is mapped to a branching processspreading in a random time-sensitive environment; determined by the dynamics of theunderlying primary infection. When both epidemics follow the Susceptible-Infective-Recovered model; we show that in order to survive; it is necessary for the secondaryinfection to evolve on a timescale that is closely matched to that of the primary infection onwhich it depends.,*,2018,*
The shape of the emerging condensate in effective models of condensation,Volker Betz; Steffen Dereich; Peter Mörters,Abstract: We consider effective models of condensation where the condensation occurs astime t goes to infinity. We provide natural conditions under which the build-up of thecondensate occurs on a spatial scale of 1/t and has the universal form of a Gamma density.The exponential parameter of this density is determined only by the equation and the totalmass of the condensate; while the power law parameter may in addition depend on thedecay properties of the initial condition near the condensation point. We apply our results tosome examples; including simple models of Bose-Einstein condensation. Subjects:Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Analysis of PDEs (math.

Robustness of spatial preferential attachment networks,Emmanuel Jacob; Peter Mörters,Abstract We study robustness under random attack for a class of networks; in which newnodes are given a spatial position and connect to existing vertices with a probabilityfavouring short spatial distances and high degrees. In this model of a scale-free network withclustering one can independently tune the power law exponent τ> 2 τ> 2 of the degreedistribution and a parameter δ> 1 δ> 1 determining the decay rate of the probability of longedges. We argue that the network is robust if τ< 2+ 1 δ τ< 2+ 1 δ; but fails to be robust if τ> 2+1 δ-1 τ> 2+ 1 δ-1. Hence robustness depends not only on the power-law exponent but alsoon the clustering features of the network.,International Workshop on Algorithms and Models for the Web-Graph,2015,*

The phase transition occurs when the power-law exponent crossesthe value four. This behaviour is in contrast to that of the contact process on thecorresponding static model; where there is no phase transition; as well as that of a classicalmean-field approximation; which has a phase transition at power-law exponent three.

Asymptotic properties of the parabolic Anderson model,Adrian Schnitzler,Das parabolische Anderson-Modell ist die Wärmeleitungsgleichung auf dem Z^ d mitzufälligem Potential. Charakteristisch für die Langzeitasymptotik der Lösung ist dasAuftreten von sich immer weiter voneinander entfernenden Inseln; in denen fast alle Massekonzentriert ist. Dieser Effekt wird als Intermittenz bezeichnet. Es gibt im Wesentlichen zweiMöglichkeiten; das Verhalten der Lösung zu betrachten. Einerseits kann man die fastsichere (quenched) Asymptotik betrachten; nachdem eine Realisierung des Potentials fixiertwurde. Andererseits kann man die (annealed) Asymptotik betrachten; nachdem derErwartungswert über das Potential genommen wurde.

http://opus. bath. ac. uk,A Collevecchio; W Konig; P Morters; N Sidorova,Abstract: We consider a classical dilute particle system in a large box with pairinteractiongiven by a Lennard-Jones-type potential. The inverse temperature is picked proportionally tothe logarithm of the particle density. We identify the free energy per particle in terms of avariational formula and show that this formula exhibits a cascade of phase transitions as thetemperature parameter ranges from zero to infinity. Loosely speaking; the particle systemseparates into spatially distant components in such a way that within each phase allcomponents are of the same size; which is the larger the lower the temperature. The maintool in our proof is a new large deviation principle for sparse point configurations.,*,*,*

Branching processes with reinforcement,Cécile Mailler; Peter Mörters; Anna Senkevich,This course is about a class of models for the growth of a stochastic system whichaccelerates through a mechanism of reinforcement. We call these models branchingprocesses with reinforcement or simply reinforced branching processes. We shall see that;due to the reinforcement; these systems display rather complex behaviour and interestingphenomena such as• phase transitions;• condensation;• travelling waves;... may occur.Some of these phenomena can be explained by techniques from the classical theory ofbranching processes (and we shall explore this in the first half of the course) others requirenew ideas and several problems are unsolved today. Although our models can describe avariety of objects; see the examples below; we shall describe them as a structuredpopulation. Parameters of our model are a probability distribution µ on the positive reals …,*,*,*

How fast are the particles of super-Brownian motion?,M Peter,Abstract. In this paper we investigate fast particles in the range and support of super-Brownian motion in the historical setting. In this setting each particle of super-Brownianmotion alive at time t is represented by a path w: 0; t]! Rd and the state of historical super-Brownian motion is a measure on the set of paths. Typical particles have Brownian paths;however in the uncountable collection of particles in the range of a super-Brownian motionthere are some which at exceptional times move faster than Brownian motion. We determinethe maximal speed of all particles during a given time period E; which turns out to be afunction of the packing dimension of E. A path w in the support of historical super-Brownianmotion at time t is called a-fast if lim suph# 0 jw (t)? w (t? h) j= p hlog (1= h) a.

Bath Institute For Complex Systems,Remco van der Hofstad; Peter Mörters; Nadia Sidorova,Abstract We study the parabolic Anderson problem; ie; the heat equation∂ tu=∆ u+ ξu on(0;∞)× Zd with independent identically distributed random potential {ξ (z): z∈ Zd} andlocalised initial condition u (0; x)= 10 (x). Our interest is in the long-term behaviour of therandom total mass U (t)= Σz u (t; z) of the unique non-negative solution in the case that thedistribution of ξ (0) is heavy tailed. For this; we study two paradigm cases of distributions withinfinite moment generating functions: the case of polynomial or Pareto tails; and the case ofstretched exponential or Weibull tails. In both cases we find asymptotic expansions for thelogarithm of the total mass up to the first random term; which we describe in terms of weaklimit theorems. In the case of polynomial tails; already the leading term in the expansion israndom. For stretched exponential tails; we observe random fluctuations in the almost …,*,*,*
Bath Institute For Complex Systems,Peter Mörters; Marcel Ortgiese,Abstract: We consider a model of directed polymers on a regular tree with a disorder givenby independent; identically distributed weights attached to the vertices. For suitable weightdistributions this model undergoes a phase transition with respect to its localizationbehaviour. We show that; for high temperatures; the free energy is supported by a randomtree of positive exponential growth rate; which is strictly smaller than that of the full tree. Thegrowth rate of the minimal supporting subtree is decreasing to zero as the temperaturedecreases to the critical value. At the critical value and all lower temperatures; a singlepolymer suffices to support the free energy. Our proofs rely on elegant martingale methodsadapted from the theory of branching random walks.,*,*,*

We considerindependent and identically distributed potentials; such that the distribution function of ξ (z)converges polynomially at infinity. If u is initially localised in the origin; ie; if u (0; x)= 1l0 (x);we show that; as time goes to infinity; the solution is completely localised in two pointsalmost surely and in one point with high probability.
