XPathLearner: An on-line self-tuning Markov histogram for XML path selectivity estimation,Lipyeow Lim; Min Wang; Sriram Padmanabhan; Jeffrey Scott Vitter; Ronald Parr,This chapter illustrates XPathLearner; a method for estimating selectivity of the mostcommonly used types of path expressions without looking at the XML data. XPathLearnergathers and refines the statistics using query feedback in an online manner and is especiallysuited to queries in Internet scale applications since the underlying XML repository is eitherinaccessible or too large to be scanned in its entirety. The extensible mark-up language(XML) is gaining widespread use as a format for data exchange and storage on the WorldWide Web. Queries over XML data require accurate selectivity estimation of pathexpressions to optimize query execution plans. Selectivity estimation of XML pathexpression is usually done based on summary statistics about the structure of the underlyingXML repository. All previous methods require an off-line scan of the XML repository to …,*,2002,110
A framework for semantic link discovery over relational data,Oktie Hassanzadeh; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Lipyeow Lim; Renée J Miller; Min Wang,Abstract Discovering links between different data items in a single data source or acrossdifferent data sources is a challenging problem faced by many information systems today. Inparticular; the recent Linking Open Data (LOD) community project has highlighted theparamount importance of establishing semantic links among web data sources. Currently;LOD sources provide billions of RDF triples; but only millions of links between data sources.Many of these data sources are published using tools that operate over relational datastored in a standard RDBMS. In this paper; we present a framework for discovery ofsemantic links from relational data. Our framework is based on declarative specification oflinkage requirements by a user. We illustrate the use of our framework using several linkdiscovery algorithms on a real world scenario. Our framework allows data publishers to …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,69

Linkedct: A linked data space for clinical trials,Oktie Hassanzadeh; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Lipyeow Lim; Renée J Miller; Min Wang,Abstract: The Linked Clinical Trials (LinkedCT) project aims at publishing the first opensemantic web data source for clinical trials data. The database exposed by LinkedCT isgenerated by (1) transforming existing data sources of clinical trials into RDF; and (2)discovering semantic links between the records in the trials data and several other datasources. In this paper; we discuss several challenges involved in these two steps andpresent the methodology used in LinkedCT to overcome these challenges. Our approach forsemantic link discovery involves using state-of-the-art approximate string matchingtechniques combined with ontology-based semantic matching of the records; all performedin a declarative and easy-to-use framework. We present an evaluation of the performance ofour proposed techniques in several link discovery scenarios in LinkedCT.,arXiv preprint arXiv:0908.0567,2009,58
Preserving XML queries during schema evolution,Mirella M Moro; Susan Malaika; Lipyeow Lim,Abstract In XML databases; new schema versions may be released as frequently as onceevery two weeks. This poster describes a taxonomy of changes for XML schema evolution. Itexamines the impact of those changes on schema validation and query evaluation.

Characterizing web document change,Lipyeow Lim; Min Wang; Sriram Padmanabhan; Jeffrey Scott Vitter; Ramesh Agarwal,Abstract The World Wide Web is growing and changing at an astonishing rate. For theinformation in the web to be useful; web information systems such as search engines haveto keep up with the growth and change of the web. In this paper we study how webdocuments change. In particular; we study two important characteristics of web documentchange that are directly related to keeping web information systems up-to-date: the degreeof the change and the clusteredness of the change. We analyze the evolution of webdocuments with respect to these two measures and discuss the implications for webinformation systems update.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2001,53
Supporting ranking and clustering as generalized order-by and group-by,Chengkai Li; Min Wang; Lipyeow Lim; Haixun Wang; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang,Abstract The Boolean semantics of SQL queries cannot adequately capture the" fuzzy"preferences and" soft" criteria required in non-traditional data retrieval applications. One wayto solve this problem is to add a flavor of" information retrieval" into database queries byallowing fuzzy query conditions and flexibly supporting grouping and ranking of the queryresults within the DBMS engine. While ranking is already supported by all major commercialDBMSs natively; support of flexibly grouping is still very limited (ie; group-by). In this paper;we propose to generalize group-by to enable flexible grouping (clustering specifically) of thequery results. Different from clustering in data mining applications; our focus is on supportingefficient clustering of Boolean results generated at query time. Moreover; we propose tointegrate ranking and clustering with Boolean conditions; forming a new type of …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,47
-SASH: A Self-Adaptive Histogram Set for Dynamically Changing Workloads,Lipyeow Lim; Min Wang; Jeffrey Scott Vitter,This chapter presents self-adaptive set of histograms (SASH) that addresses the problem ofbuilding and maintaining a set of histograms. SASH is a novel two-phase method that buildsand maintains an optimal set of histograms using only query feedback information from amultidimensional query workload; without scanning the database. SASH has also provideda unified framework that addresses the problem of which attribute sets to build histogramson; the problem of allocating memory to a set of histograms; and the problem of tuning a setof histograms to the query workload. In the online tuning phase; the current set of histogramsis tuned in response to the estimation error of each query in an online manner. In therestructuring phase; a new and more accurate set of histograms replaces the current set ofhistograms. The new set of histograms is found using information from a batch of query …,*,2003,47
A declarative framework for semantic link discovery over relational data,Oktie Hassanzadeh; Lipyeow Lim; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Min Wang,Abstract In this paper; we present a framework for online discovery of semantic links fromrelational data. Our framework is based on declarative specification of the linkagerequirements by the user; that allows matching data items in many real-world scenarios.These requirements are translated to queries that can run over the relational data source;potentially using the semantic knowledge to enhance the accuracy of link discovery. Ourframework lets data publishers to easily find and publish high-quality links to other datasources; and therefore could significantly enhance the value of the data in the nextgeneration of web.,Proceedings of the 18th international conference on World wide web,2009,46

Parallelization of XPath queries using multi-core processors: challenges and experiences,Rajesh Bordawekar; Lipyeow Lim; Oded Shmueli,Abstract In this study; we present experiences of parallelizing XPath queries using the XalanXPath engine on shared-address space multi-core systems. For our evaluation; we considera scenario where an XPath processor uses multiple threads to concurrently navigate andexecute individual XPath queries on a shared XML document. Given the constraints of theXML execution and data models; we propose three strategies for parallelizing individualXPath queries: Data partitioning; Query partitioning; and Hybrid (query and data)partitioning. We experimentally evaluated these strategies on an x86 Linux multi-coresystem using a set of XPath queries; invoked on a variety of XML documents using the XalanXPath APIs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed parallelization strategieswork very effectively in practice; for a majority of XPath queries under evaluation; the …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,43
Optimizing sensor data acquisition for energy-efficient smartphone-based continuous event processing,Archan Misra; Lipyeow Lim,Many pervasive applications; such as activity recognition or remote wellness monitoring;utilize a personal mobile device (aka smart phone) to perform continuous processing of datastreams acquired from locally-connected; wearable; sensors. To ensure the continuousoperation of such applications on a battery-limited mobile device; it is essential todramatically reduce the energy overhead associated with the process of sensor dataacquisition and processing. To achieve this goal; this paper introduces a techniqueof'acquisition-cost'aware continuous query processing; as part of the Acquisition Cost-AwareQuery Adaptation (ACQUA) framework.

Wavelet-based cost estimation for spatial queries,Min Wang; Jeffrey Scott Vitter; Lipyeow Lim; Sriram Padmanabhan,Abstract Query cost estimation is an important and well-studied problem in relationaldatabase systems. In this paper we study the cost estimation problem in the context ofspatial database systems. We introduce a new method that provides accurate costestimation for spatial selections; or window queries; by building wavelet-based histogramsfor spatial data. Our method is based upon two techniques:(a) A representationtransformation in which geometric objects are represented by points in higher-dimensionalspace and window queries correspond to semi-infinite range-sum queries; and (b)Multiresolution wavelet decomposition that provides a time-efficient and space-efficientapproximation of the underlying distribution of the multidimensional point data; especially forsemi-infinite range-sum queries. We also show for the first time how a wavelet …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2001,32

Efficient index compression in DB2 LUW,Bishwaranjan Bhattacharjee; Lipyeow Lim; Timothy Malkemus; George Mihaila; Kenneth Ross; Sherman Lau; Cathy McArthur; Zoltan Toth; Reza Sherkat,Abstract In database systems; the cost of data storage and retrieval are importantcomponents of the total cost and response time of the system. A popular mechanism toreduce the storage footprint is by compressing the data residing in tables and indexes.Compressing indexes efficiently; while maintaining response time requirements; is known tobe challenging. This is especially true when designing for a workload spectrum coveringboth data warehousing and transaction processing environments. DB2 Linux; UNIX;Windows (LUW) recently introduced index compression for use in both environments. Thisuses techniques that are able to compress index data efficiently while incurring virtually noperformance penalty for query processing. On the contrary; for certain operations; theperformance is actually better. In this paper; we detail the design of index compression in …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,27

CXHist: An on-line classification-based histogram for XML string selectivity estimation,Lipyeow Lim; Min Wang; Jeffrey Scott Vitter,Abstract Query optimization in IBM's System RX; the first truly relational-XML hybrid datamanagement system; requires accurate selectivity estimation of path-value pairs; ie; thenumber of nodes in the XML tree reachable by a given path with the given text value.Previous techniques have been inadequate; because they have focused mainly on the tag-labeled paths (tree structure) of the XML data. For most real XML data; the number of distinctstring values at the leaf nodes is orders of magnitude larger than the set of distinct rooted tagpaths. Hence; the real challenge lies in accurate selectivity estimation of the stringpredicates on the leaf values reachable via a given path. In this paper; we present CXHist; anovel workload-aware histogram technique that provides accurate selectivity estimation on abroad class of XML string-based queries.

Dynamic maintenance of web indices using landmarks,*,A repository index records the position of document entries relative to landmark entrieswithin the document. Landmark entries are selecting using a landmarking policy and theirposition relative to the document are stored in a landmark directory. During index updates;an edit transcript is generated describing the difference between old and new documentversions; and both the document repository index and the landmark directory are updated asneeded. Thus; the number of update operations preformed as compared with conventionalindexing techniques may be substantially reduced when small; localized changes are madeto the document. This is due to fact that the positions of document entries are recordedrelative to the landmark entries rather than the document itself. By doing so; the documentindex becomes more shift-invariant; requiring fewer update operations when entries are …,*,2007,23
Method for supporting ontology-related semantic queries in DBMSs with XML support,*,A method for supporting semantic matching queries in a database management system(DBMS) by extracting and storing the transitive/subsumption relationships from a givenontology data in a DBMS with native XML support.

Statistics-based parallelization of XPath queries in shared memory systems,Rajesh Bordawekar; Lipyeow Lim; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Bryant Wei-Lun Kok,Abstract The wide availability of commodity multi-core systems presents an opportunity toaddress the latency issues that have plaqued XML query processing. However; simplyexecuting multiple XML queries over multiple cores merely addresses the throughput issue:intra-query parallelization is needed to exploit multiple processing cores for better latency.Toward this effort; this paper investigates the parallelization of individual XPath queries overshared-address space multi-core processors. Much previous work on parallelizing XPath ina distributed setting failed to exploit the shared memory parallelism of multi-core systems.We propose a novel; end-to-end parallelization framework that determines the optimal wayof parallelizing an XML query. This decision is based on a statistics-based approach thatrelies both on the query specifics and the data statistics.

Semantic queries by example,Lipyeow Lim; Haixun Wang; Min Wang,Abstract With the ever increasing quantities of electronic data; there is a growing need tomake sense out of the data. Many advanced database applications are beginning to supportthis need by integrating domain knowledge encoded as ontologies into queries overrelational data. However; it is extremely difficult to express queries against graph structuredontology in the relational SQL query language or its extensions. Moreover; semantic queriesare usually not precise; especially when data and its related ontology are complicated.Users often only have a vague notion of their information needs and are not able to specifyqueries precisely.

Real time business performance monitoring and analysis using metric network,Pu Huang; Hui Lei; Lipyeow Lim,Monitoring and analyzing business performance in a continuous manner nowadays iscrucial for enterprises to achieve operational excellence; and to better align daily operationswith long-term business strategies. To do so; performance measures need to be collectedfrom daily operations and aggregated to construct higher-level key performance indicators(KPIs) in nearly real time. We propose a system called metric network for enterprise-widebusiness performance monitoring and analysis. A metric network consists of metrics; metricrepositories; aggregation agents; and knowledge agents.

Energy-efficient collaborative query processing framework for mobile sensing services,Jin Yang; Tianli Mo; Lipyeow Lim; Kai-Uwe Sattler; Archan Misra,Many emerging context-aware mobile applications involve the execution of continuousqueries over sensor data streams generated by a variety of on-board sensors on multiplepersonal mobile devices (aka smartphones). To reduce the energy-overheads of such large-scale; continuous mobile sensing and query processing; this paper introduces CQP; acollaborative query processing framework that exploits the overlap (in both the sensorsources and the query predicates) across multiple smartphones. The frameworkautomatically identifies the shareable parts of multiple executing queries; and then reducesthe overheads of repetitive execution and data transmissions; by having a setofleader'mobile nodes execute and disseminate these shareable partial results.

Classification-based method and apparatus for string selectivity estimation,*,Histogram construction and selectivity estimation for string and substring match queries indatabases of data having strings associated with attributes. The histogram constructioncounts string-attribute pairs in the documents; and outputs string-attribute-count triplessorted by count. The collection is partitioned into buckets. A synopsis is generated for thepartition; having an average selectivity or count of the string-attribute-count triples in thepartition and summary information representing the set of string-attribute pairs belonging tothe bucket. Subsequent queries; both for exact and substring matches; use the synopsis toestimate the selectivity of buckets.,*,2011,7
Cloud-based query evaluation for energy-efficient mobile sensing,Tianli Mo; Lipyeow Lim; Sougata Sen; Archan Misra; Rajesh Krishna Balan; Youngki Lee,Abstract In this paper; we reduce the energy overheads of continuous mobile sensing;specifically for the case of context-aware applications that are interested in collective contextor events; ie; events expressed as a set of complex predicates over sensor data frommultiple smartphones. We propose a cloud-based query management and optimizationframework; called CloQue; that can support thousands of such concurrent queries; executingover a large number of individual smartphones. Our central insight is that the context ofdifferent individuals & groups often have significant correlation; and that this correlation canbe learned through standard association rule mining on historical data.

Managing e-commerce catalogs in a DBMS with native XML support,Lipyeow Lim; Min Wang,Electronic commerce is emerging as a major application area for database systems. A largenumber of e-commerce stores provide electronic product catalogs that allow customers tosearch products of interest and store owners to manage various product information. Due tothe constant schema evolution and the sparsity of e-commerce data; most commercial e-commerce systems use the so-called vertical schema for data storage. However; queryprocessing for data stored using vertical schema is extremely inefficient because currentRDBMSs; especially its cost-based query optimizer; are specifically designed to deal withtraditional horizontal schemas. In this paper; we show that e-catalog management can benaturally supported in IBM's system RX; the first DBMS that truly supports both XML andrelational data in their native forms. By leveraging on system RX's hybrid nature; we …,e-Business Engineering; 2005. ICEBE 2005. IEEE International Conference on,2005,6
Probabilistic Models for One-Day Ahead Solar Irradiance Forecasting in Renewable Energy Applications,Carlos VA Silva; Lipyeow Lim; Duane Stevens; Dora Nakafuji,Solar irradiance forecasting is an important problem in renewable energy managementwhere any dips in solar energy generation must be made up for by reserves in order toensure an uninterrupted energy supply. In this paper; we study several data mining methodsfor short term solar irradiance forecasting at a given location.

Cost-optimal execution of boolean query trees with shared streams,Henri Casanova; Lipyeow Lim; Yves Robert; Frédéric Vivien; Dounia Zaidouni,The processing of queries expressed as trees of boolean operators applied to predicates onsensor data streams has several applications in mobile computing. Sensor data must beretrieved from the sensors; which incurs a cost; eg; an energy expense that depletes thebattery of a mobile query processing device. The objective is to determine the order in whichpredicates should be evaluated so as to shortcut part of the query evaluation and minimizethe expected cost. This problem has been studied assuming that each data stream occurs ata single predicate. In this work we remove this assumption since it does not necessarily holdin practice. Our main results are an optimal algorithm for single-level trees and a proof of NP-completeness for DNF trees. For DNF trees; however; we show that there is an optimalpredicate evaluation order that corresponds to a depth-first traversal.

Semantic Link Discovery over Relational Data,Oktie Hassanzadeh; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Lipyeow Lim; Renée J Miller; Min Wang,Abstract To make semantic search a reality; we need to be able to efficiently publish largedata sets containing rich semantic structure. We have tools for translating relational andsemi-structured data into RDF; but such translation tools do not have the goal of adding orproviding the kind of semantics necessary to achieve the goals of the Semantic Web andsemantic search over the Web. In this chapter; we present LinQuer; a tool for creatingsemantic links within a data source and between data sources. We focus on link discoveryover structured (relational) data since many Semantic Web sources are the result ofpublishing relational data as RDF and since relational engines provide the scalability andflexibility we need for large scale link discovery.

Query-aware compression of join results,Christopher M Mullins; Lipyeow Lim; Christian A Lang,Abstract Client-server database query processing has become an important paradigm inmany data processing applications today. In cloud-based data services; for example;queries over structured data are sent to cloud-based servers for processing and the resultsrelayed back to the client devices. Network bandwidth between client devices and cloud-based servers is often a limited resource and the use of data compression to reduce theamount of query result data transmitted would not only conserve bandwidth but also helpwith battery lifetime in the case of mobile client devices. For query result compression;current data compression methods do not exploit redundancy information that can beinferred from the query structure itself for greater compression.

Each variable lengthstructure comprises one or more data block. A variable length encoding process is appliedto the one or more blocks of each variable length data structure which comprises setting acontinuation data value in each block to a first value or a second value; wherein the settingof the continuation data values enables bi-directional scanning of each variable length …,*,2012,2

To Parallelize or Not to Parallelize: XPath Queries on Multi-core Systems,Rajesh Bordawekar; Lipyeow Lim; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; B Kok,ABSTRACT With wide availability of commodity multi-core systems; it is imperative tounderstand what; if any; changes are needed to existing software systems to harness thenewly available computational power. In this context; this work explores acceleration of XMLprocessing systems. Specifically; we investigate parallelization of individual XPath queriesover shared-address space multi-core processors. Unlike past approaches that haveconsidered a distributed setting or ad hoc parallel solutions; ours is the first methodicalendto-end proposal. Our solution first identifies if a particular XPath query should beparallelized and then determines the optimal way of parallelizing that query. This decision isbased on a cost-base approach that relies both on the query specifics and data statistics.

Modeling and querying E-commerce data in hybrid relational-XML DBMSs,Lipyeow Lim; Haixun Wang; Min Wang,Abstract Data in many industrial application systems are often neither completely structurednor unstructured. Consequently semi-structured data models such as XML have becomepopular as a lowest common denominator to manage such data. The problem is thatalthough XML is adequate to represent the flexible portion of the data; it fails to exploit thehighly structured portion of the data. XML normalization theory could be used to factor outthe structured portion of the data at the schema level; however; queries written against theoriginal schema no longer run on the normalized XML data. In this paper; we propose a newapproach called eXtricate that stores XML documents in a space-efficient decomposed waywhile supporting efficient processing on the original queries. Our method exploits the factthat considerable amount of information is shared among similar XML documents; and by …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2008,2
Persisting and querying biometric event streams with hybrid relational-XML DBMS,Daby M Sow; Lipyeow Lim; Min Wang; Kyu Hyun Kim,Abstract Remote monitoring of patients' biometric data streams offers the possibility tophysicians to extend and improve their services to chronically ill patients who are away frommedical institutions. This emerging technology is a promising way to address importantaspects of the cost issues that most health care systems are experiencing. In order to fulfill itspotential; several challenges need to be overcome.

Cost-optimal execution of trees of boolean operators with shared streams,Henri Casanova; Lipyeow Lim; Yves Robert; Frédéric Vivien; Dounia Zaidouni,The processing of queries expressed as trees of boolean operators applied to predicates onsensor data streams has several applications in mobile computing. Sensor data must beretrieved from the sensors to a query processing device; such as a smartphone; over one ormore network interfaces. Retrieving a data item incurs a cost; eg; an energy expense thatdepletes the smartphone's battery. Since the query tree contains boolean operators; part ofthe tree can be shortcircuited depending on the retrieved sensor data. An interestingproblem is to determine the order in which predicates should be evaluated so as to minimizethe expected query processing cost. This problem has been studied in previous workassuming that each data stream occurs in a single predicate. In this work we remove thisassumption since it does not necessarily hold for real-world queries. Our main results are …,*,2013,1
Optimizing access across multiple hierarchies in data warehouses,Lipyeow Lim; Bishwaranjan Bhattacharjee,In enterprise data warehouses; different users in different business units often define theirown application specific dimension hierarchies tailor made to their reporting and businessperformance monitoring needs. Due to resource constraints; only on a small number ofthese hierarchies are precomputed for performance optimization. Consequentlyaggregations over hierarchies without precomputations are often less responsive. We reporton a performance problem in a very large banking enterprise where the large number ofapplication specific hierarchies became a performance bottleneck. This paper proposes anovel solution for optimizing the performance of data warehouses with a large number ofapplication specific hierarchies. We exploit the observation that dimension hierarchies inreal data warehouses often contain significant overlaps.

Semantic query by example,Lipyeow Lim; Haixun Wang; Min Wang,ABSTRACT Supporting semantic queries in relational databases is essential to manyadvanced applications. Recently; with the increasing use of ontology in various applications;the need for querying relational data togther with its related ontology has become moreurgent. In this paper; we identify two fundamental challenges in this task. First; it is extremelydifficult to express queries against graph structured ontology in the relational querylanguage SQL; and second; in many cases where data and its related ontology arecomplicated; queries are usually not precise; that is; users often have only a vague notion;rather than a clear understanding and definition; of what they query for. To address the twochallenges; we introduce a novel method that enables us to support semantic queries inrelational databases with ease.

Optimizing hierarchical access in OLAP environment,Lipyeow Lim; Bishwaranjan Bhattacharjee,In Online Analytic Processing (OLAP) deployments; different users; lines of businesses andbusiness units often create adhoc aggregation hierarchies tailor-made for specific reportingor analytical applications. As a result; a large number of these application specifichierarchies accumulate over time. System administrators typically are not able to optimize allthese hierarchical accesses by hand due to the large number of hierarchies. However; manyoptimization opportunities exist due to the significant amount of overlap between somehierarhies. In this paper; we sketch a novel method for optimizing OLAP aggregation queriesusing precomputed aggregates on other overlapping hierarchies. Our method detectscommon sub-structures among hierarchies and provides a rewriting algorithm to exploit anyprecomputations on these shared sub-structures.,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008.

A Differentially Private Matching Scheme for Pairing Similar Users of Proximity Based Social Networking applications,Michael Sommer; Lipyeow Lim; Depeng Li,The pervasiveness of smartphones has made connecting with users through proximitybased mobile social networks commonplace in today's culture. Many such networks connectusers by matching them based on shared interests. With ever-increasing concern for privacy;users are wary of openly sharing personal information with strangers. Several methods haveaddressed this privacy concern such as encryption and k-anonymity; but none addressissues of eliminating third party matches; achieving relevant matches; and prohibitingmalicious users from inferring information based on their input into the system. In this paper;we propose a matching scheme that accurately pairs similar users while simultaneouslyproviding protection from malicious users inferring information.

Low-latency XPath Query Evaluation on Multi-Core Processors,Benjamin Karsin; Henri Casanova; Lipyeow Lim,Abstract XML and the XPath querying language have become ubiquitous data and queryingstandards used in many industrial settings and across the World-Wide Web. The highlatency of XPath queries over large XML databases remains a problem for manyapplications. While this latency could be reduced by parallel execution; issues such as workpartitioning; memory contention; and load imbalance may diminish the benefits ofparallelization. We propose three parallel XPath query engines: Static Work Partitioning;Work Queue; and Producer-Consumer-Hybrid. All three engines attempt to solve the issue ofload imbalance while minimizing sequential execution time and overhead. We analyze theirperformance on sets of synthetic and real-world datasets. Results obtained on two multi-coreplatforms show that while load-balancing is easily achieved for most synthetic datasets …,*,2017,*
