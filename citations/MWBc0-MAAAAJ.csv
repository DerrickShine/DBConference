Strabon: a semantic geospatial DBMS,Kostis Kyzirakos; Manos Karpathiotakis; Manolis Koubarakis,Abstract We present Strabon; a new RDF store that supports the state of the art semanticgeospatial query languages stSPARQL and GeoSPARQL. To illustrate the expressive poweroffered by these query languages and their implementation in Strabon; we concentrate onthe new version of the data model stRDF and the query language stSPARQL that we havedeveloped ourselves. Like GeoSPARQL; these new versions use OGC standards torepresent geometries where the original versions used linear constraints. We study theperformance of Strabon experimentally and show that it scales to very large data volumesand performs; most of the times; better than all other geospatial RDF stores it has beencompared with.,International Semantic Web Conference,2012,103
Modeling and querying metadata in the semantic sensor web: The model stRDF and the query language stSPARQL,Manolis Koubarakis; Kostis Kyzirakos,Abstract RDF will often be the metadata model of choice in the Semantic Sensor Web.However; RDF can only represent thematic metadata and needs to be extended if we wantto model spatial and temporal information. For this purpose; we develop the data modelstRDF and the query language stSPARQL. stRDF is a constraint data model that extendsRDF with the ability to represent spatial and temporal data. stSPARQL extends SPARQL forquerying stRDF data. In our extension to RDF; we follow the main ideas of constraintdatabases and represent spatial and temporal objects as quantifier-free formulas in a first-order logic of linear constraints. Thus an important contribution of stRDF is to bring to theRDF world the benefits of constraint databases and constraint-based reasoning so thatspatial and temporal data can be represented in RDF using constraints.,Extended Semantic Web Conference,2010,95
A semantically enabled service architecture for mashups over streaming and stored data,Alasdair JG Gray; Raúl García-Castro; Kostis Kyzirakos; Manos Karpathiotakis; Jean-Paul Calbimonte; Kevin Page; Jason Sadler; Alex Frazer; Ixent Galpin; Alvaro AA Fernandes; Norman W Paton; Oscar Corcho; Manolis Koubarakis; David De Roure; Kirk Martinez; Asunción Gómez-Pérez,Abstract Sensing devices are increasingly being deployed to monitor the physical worldaround us. One class of application for which sensor data is pertinent is environmentaldecision support systems; eg flood emergency response. However; in order to interpret thereadings from the sensors; the data needs to be put in context through correlation with othersensor readings; sensor data histories; and stored data; as well as juxtaposing with mapsand forecast models. In this paper we use a flood emergency response planning applicationto identify requirements for a semantic sensor web. We propose a generic servicearchitecture to satisfy the requirements that uses semantic annotations to support well-informed interactions between the services. We present the SemSor-Grid4Env realisation ofthe architecture and illustrate its capabilities in the context of the example application.,Extended Semantic Web Conference,2011,59
SPARQL query optimization on top of DHTs,Zoi Kaoudi; Kostis Kyzirakos; Manolis Koubarakis,Abstract We study the problem of SPARQL query optimization on top of distributed hashtables. Existing works on SPARQL query processing in such environments have never beenimplemented in a real system; or do not utilize any optimization techniques and thus exhibitpoor performance. Our goal in this paper is to propose efficient and scalable algorithms foroptimizing SPARQL basic graph pattern queries. We augment a known distributed queryprocessing algorithm with query optimization strategies that improve performance in terms ofquery response time and bandwidth usage. We implement our techniques in the systemAtlas and study their performance experimentally in a local cluster.,International Semantic Web Conference,2010,49
Atlas: Storing; updating and querying RDF (S) data on top of DHTs,Zoi Kaoudi; Manolis Koubarakis; Kostis Kyzirakos; Iris Miliaraki; Matoula Magiridou; Antonios Papadakis-Pesaresi,Abstract The RDF (S) data model has been proposed for encoding metadata about Webresources. As more and more Web resources are annotated using RDF (S); there is anurgent need for efficiently dealing with this large volume of data. In this paper; we presentAtlas; a peer-to-peer system for storing; updating and querying RDF (S) data. The Atlassystem has been built using the distributed hash table Bamboo. Atlas was developed in thecontext of project OntoGrid; where it was used as a distributed repository for RDF (S)metadata describing Grid services and resources. The development of Atlas continues inother projects that our group participates currently. This paper gives an overview of the mostrecent version of Atlas and discusses a representative application.,Web Semantics: Science; Services and Agents on the World Wide Web,2010,42

However;there is no widely used benchmark for evaluating geospatial RDF stores which takes intoaccount recent advances to the state of the art in this area. In this paper; we develop abenchmark; called Geographica; which uses both real-world and synthetic data to test theoffered functionality and the performance of some prominent geospatial RDF stores.,International Semantic Web Conference,2013,34
A semantic sensor web for environmental decision support applications,Alasdair JG Gray; Jason Sadler; Oles Kit; Kostis Kyzirakos; Manos Karpathiotakis; Jean-Paul Calbimonte; Kevin Page; Raúl García-Castro; Alex Frazer; Ixent Galpin; Alvaro AA Fernandes; Norman W Paton; Oscar Corcho; Manolis Koubarakis; David De Roure; Kirk Martinez; Asunción Gómez-Pérez,Abstract: Sensing devices are increasingly being deployed to monitor the physical worldaround us. One class of application for which sensor data is pertinent is environmentaldecision support systems; eg; flood emergency response. For these applications; the sensorreadings need to be put in context by integrating them with other sources of data about thesurrounding environment. Traditional systems for predicting and detecting floods rely onmethods that need significant human resources. In this paper we describe a semanticsensor web architecture for integrating multiple heterogeneous datasets; including live andhistoric sensor data; databases; and map layers. The architecture provides mechanisms fordiscovering datasets; defining integrated views over them; continuously receiving data inreal-time; and visualising on screen and interacting with the data.

GeoTriples: a Tool for Publishing Geospatial Data as RDF Graphs Using R2RML Mappings.,Kostis Kyzirakos; Ioannis Vlachopoulos; Dimitrianos Savva; Stefan Manegold; Manolis Koubarakis,Abstract. A plethora of Earth Observation data that is becoming available at no charge inEurope and the US recently reflects the strong push for more open Earth Observation data.Linked data is a paradigm which studies how one can make data available on the Web; andinterconnect it with other data with the aim of making the value of the resulting “Web of data”greater than the sum of its parts. Open Earth Observation data that are currently madeavailable by space agencies such as ESA and NASA are not following the linked dataparadigm. Therefore; Earth Observation data and other kinds of geospatial data that arenecessary for a user to satisfy her information needs can only be found in different data silos;where each silo may contain only part of the needed data. Publishing the content of thesesilos as RDF graphs; enables the development of data analytics applications with great …,International Semantic Web Conference (Posters & Demos),2014,14

Sextant: Visualizing time-evolving linked geospatial data,Charalampos Nikolaou; Kallirroi Dogani; Konstantina Bereta; George Garbis; Manos Karpathiotakis; Kostis Kyzirakos; Manolis Koubarakis,Abstract The linked open data cloud is constantly evolving as datasets get continuouslyupdated with newer versions. As a result; representing; querying; and visualizing thetemporal dimension of linked data is crucial. This is especially important for geospatialdatasets that form the backbone of large scale open data publication efforts in many sectorsof the economy (eg; the public sector; the Earth Observation sector). Although there hasbeen some work on the representation and querying of linked geospatial data that changeover time; to the best of our knowledge; there is currently no tool that offers spatio-temporalvisualization of such data. This is in contrast with the existence of many tools for thevisualization of the temporal evolution of geospatial data in the GIS area.

As aresult; Earth Observation (EO) data has been constantly increasing in volume in the last fewyears; and is currently reaching petabytes in many satellite archives. For example; the multi-mission data archive of the TELEIOS partner German Aerospace Center (DLR) is expectedto reach 2PB next year; while ESA estimates that it will be archiving 20PB of data before theyear 2020. As the volume of data in satellite archives has been increasing; so have thescientific and commercial applications of EO data.

Browsing and Visualization of Linked Environmental Data,Charalampos Nikolaou; Kostis Kyzirakos; Konstantina Bereta; Kallirroi Dogani; Manolis Koubarakis,Abstract Linked environmental data has started to appear on the Web as environmentalresearchers make use of technologies such as ontologies; RDF; and SPARQL. Many ofthese datasets have an important geospatial and temporal dimension. The same is true alsofor the Web of data that is being rapidly populated not only with geospatial information; butalso with temporal information. As the real-world entities represented in linked geospatialdatasets evolve over time; the datasets themselves get updated and both the spatial and thetemporal dimension of data become significant for users. For example; in the EarthObservation and Environment domains; data is constantly produced by satellite sensors andis associated with metadata containing; among others; temporal attributes; such as the timethat an image was acquired. In addition; the acquisitions are considered to be valid for …,EGU General Assembly Conference Abstracts,2014,*

Improving knowledge discovery from synthetic aperture radar images using the linked open data cloud and Sextant,Charalampos Nikolaou; Kostis Kyzirakos; Konstantina Bereta; Kallirroi Dogani; Stella Giannakopoulou; Panayiotis Smeros; George Garbis; Manolis Koubarakis; DE Molina; OC Dumitru; Gottfried Schwarz; Mihai Datcu,ABSTRACT In the last few years; thanks to projects like TELEIOS; the linked open data cloudhas been rapidly populated with geospatial data some of it describing Earth Observationproducts (eg; CORINE Land Cover; Urban Atlas). The abundance of this data can prove veryuseful to the new missions (eg; Sentinels) as a means to increase the usability of the millionsof images and EO products that are expected to be produced by these missions.

Open EO data thatare currently made available by space agencies are not following the linked data paradigm.Therefore; from the perspective of a user; the EO data and other kinds of geospatial datanecessary to satisfy his or her information need can only be found in different data silos;where each silo may contain only part of the needed data. Opening up these silos bypublishing their contents as RDF and interlinking them with semantic connections will allowthe development of data analytics applications with great environmental and financial value.This is the goal of the new European project LEO which we introduce in this paper.,*,2014,*

Integration of sensor networks and linked data in a coastal flooding scenario,K Martinez; K Page; J Sadler; C Hutton; O Corcho; R Garcia; M Koubarakis; K Kyzirakos,Abstract One of the issues of current interest in sensor networks is how to discover andintegrate data from a wide range of sources: from data persisted in legacy informationsystems or coming from sensor networks to data available in the Web (ie; linked data). Oneway to facilitate disparate data discovery and integration is to describe them semantically.The SemsorGrid4Env project is working on systems where data sources can be located withsemantic web technologies while defacto standards can be used to actually access the data.By building a demonstration around a coastal flooding scenario we had to build bridgesbetween the terms used by domain experts and those used by data providers and todevelop the necessary data integration mechanisms supported by this semanticreconciliation.

Strabon: A Semantic Geospatial DBMS⋆(Long Version),Kostis Kyzirakos; Manos Karpathiotakis; Manolis Koubarakis,Abstract. We present Strabon; a new RDF store that supports the state of the art semanticgeospatial query languages stSPARQL and GeoSPARQL. To illustrate the expressive poweroffered by these query languages and their implementation in Strabon; we concentrate onthe new version of the data model stRDF and the query language stSPARQL that we havedeveloped ourselves. Like GeoSPARQL; these new versions use OGC standards torepresent geometries where the original versions used linear constraints. We study theperformance of Strabon experimentally and show that it scales to very large data volumesand performs; most of the times; better than all other geospatial RDF stores it has beencompared with.,*,*,*
