The sybil attack in sensor networks: analysis & defenses,James Newsome; Elaine Shi; Dawn Song; Adrian Perrig,Abstract Security is important for many sensor network applications. A particularly harmfulattack against sensor and ad hoc networks is known as the Sybil attack [6]; where a nodeillegitimately claims multiple identities. This paper systematically analyzes the threat posedby the Sybil attack to wireless sensor networks. We demonstrate that the attack can beexceedingly detrimental to many important functions of the sensor network such as routing;resource allocation; misbehavior detection; etc. We establish a classification of differenttypes of the Sybil attack; which enables us to better understand the threats posed by eachtype; and better design countermeasures against each type. We then propose several noveltechniques to defend against the Sybil attack; and analyze their effectiveness quantitatively.,Proceedings of the 3rd international symposium on Information processing in sensor networks,2004,1651
Controlling data in the cloud: outsourcing computation without outsourcing control,Richard Chow; Philippe Golle; Markus Jakobsson; Elaine Shi; Jessica Staddon; Ryusuke Masuoka; Jesus Molina,Abstract Cloud computing is clearly one of today's most enticing technology areas due; atleast in part; to its cost-efficiency and flexibility. However; despite the surge in activity andinterest; there are significant; persistent concerns about cloud computing that are impedingmomentum and will eventually compromise the vision of cloud computing as a new ITprocurement model. In this paper; we characterize the problems and their impact onadoption. In addition; and equally importantly; we describe how the combination of existingresearch thrusts has the potential to alleviate many of the concerns impeding adoption. Inparticular; we argue that with continued research advances in trusted computing andcomputation-supporting encryption; life in the cloud can be advantageous from a businessintelligence standpoint over the isolated alternative that is more common today.,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM workshop on Cloud computing security,2009,864
Designing secure sensor networks,Elaine Shi; Adrian Perrig,Sensor networks are expected to play an essential role in the upcoming age of pervasivecomputing. Due to their constraints in computation; memory; and power resources; theirsusceptibility to physical capture; and use of wireless communications; security is achallenge in these networks. The scale of deployments of wireless sensor networks requirecareful decisions and trade-offs among various security measures. The authors discussthese issues and consider mechanisms to achieve secure communication in these networks.,IEEE Wireless Communications,2004,656
Multi-dimensional range query over encrypted data,Elaine Shi; John Bethencourt; TH Hubert Chan; Dawn Song; Adrian Perrig,We design an encryption scheme called multi-dimensional range query over encrypted data(MRQED); to address the privacy concerns related to the sharing of network audit logs andvarious other applications. Our scheme allows a network gateway to encrypt summaries ofnetwork flows before submitting them to an untrusted repository. When network intrusionsare suspected; an authority can release a key to an auditor; allowing the auditor to decryptflows whose attributes (eg; source and destination addresses; port numbers; etc.) fall withinspecific ranges. However; the privacy of all irrelevant flows are still preserved. We formallydefine the security for MRQED and prove the security of our construction under the decisionbilinear Diffie-Hellman and decision linear assumptions in certain bilinear groups. We studythe practical performance of our construction in the context of network audit logs. Apart …,Security and Privacy; 2007. SP'07. IEEE Symposium on,2007,500
Path ORAM: an extremely simple oblivious RAM protocol,Emil Stefanov; Marten Van Dijk; Elaine Shi; Christopher Fletcher; Ling Ren; Xiangyao Yu; Srinivas Devadas,Abstract We present Path ORAM; an extremely simple Oblivious RAM protocol with a smallamount of client storage. Partly due to its simplicity; Path ORAM is the most practical ORAMscheme for small client storage known to date. We formally prove that Path ORAM requireslog^ 2 N/log X bandwidth overhead for block size B= X log N. For block sizes bigger thanOmega (log^ 2 N); Path ORAM is asymptotically better than the best known ORAM schemewith small client storage. Due to its practicality; Path ORAM has been adopted in the designof secure processors since its proposal.,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGSAC conference on Computer & communications security,2013,411
Privacy-preserving aggregation of time-series data,Elaine Shi; HTH Chan; Eleanor Rieffel; Richard Chow; Dawn Song,We consider how an untrusted data aggregator can learn desired statistics over multipleparticipants' data; without compromising each individual's privacy. We propose aconstruction that allows a group of participants to periodically upload encrypted values to adata aggregator; such that the aggregator is able to compute the sum of all participants'values in every time period; but is unable to learn anything else. We achieve strong privacyguarantees using two main techniques. First; we show how to utilize applied cryptographictechniques to allow the aggregator to decrypt the sum from multiple ciphertexts encryptedunder different user keys. Second; we describe a distributed data randomization procedurethat guarantees the differential privacy of the outcome statistic; even when a subset ofparticipants might be compromised.,Annual Network & Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS),2011,376
Pioneer: verifying code integrity and enforcing untampered code execution on legacy systems,Arvind Seshadri; Mark Luk; Elaine Shi; Adrian Perrig; Leendert van Doorn; Pradeep Khosla,Abstract We propose a primitive; called Pioneer; as a first step towards verifiable codeexecution on untrusted legacy hosts. Pioneer does not require any hardware support suchas secure co-processors or CPU-architecture extensions. We implement Pioneer on an IntelPentium IV Xeon processor. Pioneer can be used as a basic building block to build securitysystems. We demonstrate this by building a kernel rootkit detector.,ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review,2005,371
Bitter to better—how to make bitcoin a better currency,Simon Barber; Xavier Boyen; Elaine Shi; Ersin Uzun,Abstract Bitcoin is a distributed digital currency which has attracted a substantial number ofusers. We perform an in-depth investigation to understand what made Bitcoin so successful;while decades of research on cryptographic e-cash has not lead to a large-scaledeployment. We ask also how Bitcoin could become a good candidate for a long-lived stablecurrency. In doing so; we identify several issues and attacks of Bitcoin; and propose suitabletechniques to address them.,International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security,2012,343
Predicate privacy in encryption systems,Emily Shen; Elaine Shi; Brent Waters,Abstract Predicate encryption is a new encryption paradigm which gives a master secret keyowner fine-grained control over access to encrypted data. The master secret key owner cangenerate secret key tokens corresponding to predicates. An encryption of data x can beevaluated using a secret token corresponding to a predicate f; the user learns whether thedata satisfies the predicate; ie; whether f (x)= 1. Prior work on public-key predicateencryption has focused on the notion of data or plaintext privacy; the property thatciphertexts reveal no information about the encrypted data to an attacker other than what isinherently revealed by the tokens the attacker possesses. In this paper; we consider a newnotion called predicate privacy; the property that tokens reveal no information about theencoded query predicate. Predicate privacy is inherently impossible to achieve in the …,Theory of Cryptography Conference,2009,327
Bind: A fine-grained attestation service for secure distributed systems,Elaine Shi; Adrian Perrig; Leendert Van Doorn,In this paper we propose BIND (binding instructions and data); a fine-grained attestationservice for securing distributed systems. Code attestation has recently receivedconsiderable attention in trusted computing. However; current code attestation technology isrelatively immature. First; due to the great variability in software versions and configurations;verification of the hash is difficult. Second; the time-of-use and time-of-attestationdiscrepancy remains to be addressed; since the code may be correct at the time of theattestation; but it may be compromised by the time of use. The goal of BIND is to addressthese issues and make code attestation more usable in securing distributed systems. BINDoffers the following properties:(1) BIND performs fine-grained attestation. Instead of attestingto the entire memory content; BIND attests only to the piece of code we are concerned …,Security and Privacy; 2005 IEEE Symposium on,2005,293
Oblivious RAM with O ((logN) 3) worst-case cost,Elaine Shi; T-H Hubert Chan; Emil Stefanov; Mingfei Li,Abstract Oblivious RAM is a useful primitive that allows a client to hide its data accesspatterns from an untrusted server in storage outsourcing applications. Until recently; mostprior works on Oblivious RAM aim to optimize its amortized cost; while suffering from linearor even higher worst-case cost. Such poor worst-case behavior renders these schemesimpractical in realistic settings; since a data access request can occasionally be blockedwaiting for an unreasonably large number of operations to complete. This paper proposesnovel Oblivious RAM constructions that achieves poly-logarithmic worst-case cost; whileconsuming constant client-side storage. To achieve the desired worst-case asymptoticperformance; we propose a novel technique in which we organize the O-RAM storage into abinary tree over data buckets; while moving data blocks obliviously along tree edges.,International Conference on The Theory and Application of Cryptology and Information Security,2011,291

Asynchronized systems arerelatively simple. An organization can use the Internet to publish hyperlinked multimediacontent and reach a wide audience. Yet; most current courseware is simply textbookmaterial transferred to HTML; instead of reading the book; students read the screen.

Towards practical oblivious RAM,Emil Stefanov; Elaine Shi; Dawn Song,Abstract: We take an important step forward in making Oblivious RAM (O-RAM) practical. Wepropose an O-RAM construction achieving an amortized overhead of 20X-35X (for an O-RAM roughly 1 terabyte in size); about 63 times faster than the best existing scheme. On thetheoretic front; we propose a fundamentally novel technique for constructing ObliviousRAMs: specifically; we partition a bigger O-RAM into smaller O-RAMs; and employ abackground eviction technique to obliviously evict blocks from the client-side cache into arandomly assigned server-side partition. This novel technique is the key to achieving thegains in practical performance. Subjects: Cryptography and Security (cs. CR) Cite as: arXiv:1106.3652 [cs. CR](or arXiv: 1106.3652 v5 [cs.

TACKing together efficient authentication; revocation; and privacy in VANETs,Ahren Studer; Elaine Shi; Fan Bai; Adrian Perrig,Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) require a mechanism to help authenticate messages;identify valid vehicles; and remove malevolent vehicles. A public key infrastructure (PKI) canprovide this functionality using certificates and fixed public keys. However; fixed keys allowan eavesdropper to associate a key with a vehicle and a location; violating drivers' privacy.In this work we propose a VANET key management scheme based on temporaryanonymous certified keys (TACKs). Our scheme efficiently prevents eavesdroppers fromlinking a vehicle's different keys and provides timely revocation of misbehaving participantswhile maintaining the same or less overhead for vehicle-to-vehicle communication as thecurrent IEEE 1609.2 standard for VANET security.,Sensor; Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks; 2009.

Implicit authentication for mobile devices,Markus Jakobsson; Elaine Shi; Philippe Golle; Richard Chow,Abstract. We introduce the notion of implicit authentication–the ability to authenticate mobileusers based on actions they would carry out anyway. We develop a model for how toperform implicit authentication; and describe experiments aimed at assessing the benefits ofour techniques. Our preliminary findings support that this is a meaningful approach; whetherused to increase usability or increase security.,Proceedings of the 4th USENIX conference on Hot topics in security,2009,217
Hawk: The blockchain model of cryptography and privacy-preserving smart contracts,Ahmed Kosba; Andrew Miller; Elaine Shi; Zikai Wen; Charalampos Papamanthou,Emerging smart contract systems over decentralized cryptocurrencies allow mutuallydistrustful parties to transact safely without trusted third parties. In the event of contractualbreaches or aborts; the decentralized blockchain ensures that honest parties obtaincommensurate compensation. Existing systems; however; lack transactional privacy. Alltransactions; including flow of money between pseudonyms and amount transacted; areexposed on the blockchain. We present Hawk; a decentralized smart contract system thatdoes not store financial transactions in the clear on the blockchain; thus retainingtransactional privacy from the public's view. A Hawk programmer can write a private smartcontract in an intuitive manner without having to implement cryptography; and our compilerautomatically generates an efficient cryptographic protocol where contractual parties …,Security and Privacy (SP); 2016 IEEE Symposium on,2016,216
Portcullis: protecting connection setup from denial-of-capability attacks,Bryan Parno; Dan Wendlandt; Elaine Shi; Adrian Perrig; Bruce Maggs; Yih-Chun Hu,Abstract Systems using capabilities to provide preferential service to selected flows havebeen proposed as a defense against large-scale network denial-of-service attacks. Whilethese systems offer strong protection for established network flows; the Denial-of-Capability(DoC) attack; which prevents new capability-setup packets from reaching the destination;limits the value of these systems. Portcullis mitigates DoC attacks by allocating scarce linkbandwidth for connection establishment packets based on per-computation fairness. Weprove that a legitimate sender can establish a capability with high probability regardless ofan attacker's resources or strategy and that no system can improve on our guarantee. Wesimulate full and partial deployments of Portcullis on an Internet-scale topology to confirmour theoretical results and demonstrate the substantial benefits of using per-computation …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2007,204
Implicit authentication through learning user behavior,Elaine Shi; Yuan Niu; Markus Jakobsson; Richard Chow,Abstract Users are increasingly dependent on mobile devices. However; currentauthentication methods like password entry are significantly more frustrating and difficult toperform on these devices; leading users to create and reuse shorter passwords and pins; orno authentication at all. We present implicit authentication-authenticating users based onbehavior patterns. We describe our model for performing implicit authentication and assessour techniques using more than two weeks of collected data from over 50 subjects.,International Conference on Information Security,2010,195
Private and continual release of statistics,T-H Hubert Chan; Elaine Shi; Dawn Song,Abstract We ask the question: how can Web sites and data aggregators continually releaseupdated statistics; and meanwhile preserve each individual user's privacy? Suppose we aregiven a stream of 0's and 1's. We propose a differentially private continual counter thatoutputs at every time step the approximate number of 1's seen thus far. Our counterconstruction has error that is only poly-log in the number of time steps. We can extend thebasic counter construction to allow Web sites to continually give top-k and hot itemssuggestions while preserving users' privacy.,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),2011,183

Delegating capabilities in predicate encryption systems,Elaine Shi; Brent Waters,Abstract In predicate encryption systems; given a capability; one can evaluate one or morepredicates on the plaintext encrypted; while all other information about the plaintext remainshidden. We consider the role of delegation in such predicate encryption systems. SupposeAlice has a capability; and she wishes to delegate to Bob a more restrictive capabilityallowing the decryption of a subset of the information Alice can learn about the plaintextencrypted. We formally define delegation in predicate encryption systems; propose a newsecurity definition for delegation; and give an efficient construction supporting conjunctivequeries. The security of our construction can be reduced to the general 3-party Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption; and the Bilinear Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption in compositeorder bilinear groups.,International Colloquium on Automata; Languages; and Programming,2008,181

Oblivistore: High performance oblivious cloud storage,Emil Stefanov; Elaine Shi,We design and build ObliviStore; a high performance; distributed ORAM-based cloud datastore secure in the malicious model. To the best of our knowledge; ObliviStore is the fastestORAM implementation known to date; and is faster by 10X or more in comparison with thebest known ORAM implementation. ObliviStore achieves high throughput by making I/Ooperations asynchronous. Asynchrony introduces security challenges; ie; we must preventinformation leakage not only through access patterns; but also through timing of I/O events.We propose various practical optimizations which are key to achieving high performance; aswell as techniques for a data center to dynamically scale up a distributed ORAM. We showthat with 11 trusted machines (each with a modern CPU); and 20 Solid State Drives;ObliviStore achieves a throughput of 31.5 MB/s with a block size of 4KB.,Security and Privacy (SP); 2013 IEEE Symposium on,2013,177
Detection of denial-of-message attacks on sensor network broadcasts,Jonathan M McCune; Elaine Shi; Adrian Perrig; Michael K Reiter,So far sensor network broadcast protocols assume a trustworthy environment. However insafety and mission-critical sensor networks this assumption may not be valid and somesensor nodes might be adversarial. In these environments; malicious sensor nodes candeprive other nodes from receiving a broadcast message. We call this attack a denial-of-message attack (DoM). In this paper we model and analyze this attack; and presentcountermeasures. We present SIS; a secure implicit sampling scheme that permits abroadcasting base station to probabilistically detect the failure of nodes to receive itsbroadcast; even if these failures result from an attacker motivated to induce these failuresundetectably. SIS works by eliciting authenticated acknowledgments from a subset of nodesper broadcast; where the subset is unpredictable to the attacker and tunable so as to …,Security and Privacy; 2005 IEEE Symposium on,2005,171

We analyze how fundamental and circumstantialbottlenecks in Bitcoin limit the ability of its current peer-to-peer overlay network to supportsubstantially higher throughputs and lower latencies. Our results suggest thatreparameterization of block size and intervals should be viewed only as a first incrementtoward achieving next-generation; high-load blockchain protocols; and major advances willadditionally require a basic rethinking of technical approaches. We offer a structuredperspective on the design space for such approaches. Within this perspective; weenumerate and briefly discuss a number of recently proposed protocol ideas and offerseveral new ideas and open challenges.,International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security,2016,160
Multi-input functional encryption,Shafi Goldwasser; S Dov Gordon; Vipul Goyal; Abhishek Jain; Jonathan Katz; Feng-Hao Liu; Amit Sahai; Elaine Shi; Hong-Sheng Zhou,Abstract We introduce the problem of Multi-Input Functional Encryption; where a secret keysk f can correspond to an n-ary function f that takes multiple ciphertexts as input. Weformulate both indistinguishability-based and simulation-based definitions of security for thisnotion; and show close connections with indistinguishability and virtual black-box definitionsof obfuscation. Assuming indistinguishability obfuscation for circuits; we presentconstructions achieving indistinguishability security for a large class of settings.

GUPT: privacy preserving data analysis made easy,Prashanth Mohan; Abhradeep Thakurta; Elaine Shi; Dawn Song; David Culler,Abstract It is often highly valuable for organizations to have their data analyzed by externalagents. However; any program that computes on potentially sensitive data risks leakinginformation through its output. Differential privacy provides a theoretical framework forprocessing data while protecting the privacy of individual records in a dataset. Unfortunately;it has seen limited adoption because of the loss in output accuracy; the difficulty in makingprograms differentially private; lack of mechanisms to describe the privacy budget in aprogrammer's utilitarian terms; and the challenging requirement that data owners and dataanalysts manually distribute the limited privacy budget between queries. This paperpresents the design and evaluation of a new system; GUPT; that overcomes thesechallenges.

Authentication in the clouds: a framework and its application to mobile users,Richard Chow; Markus Jakobsson; Ryusuke Masuoka; Jesus Molina; Yuan Niu; Elaine Shi; Zhexuan Song,Abstract Cloud computing is a natural fit for mobile security. Typical handsets have inputconstraints and practical computational and power limitations; which must be respected bymobile security technologies in order to be effective. We describe how cloud computing canaddress these issues. Our approach is based on a flexible framework for supportingauthentication decisions we call TrustCube (to manage the authentication infrastructure) andon a behavioral authentication approach referred to as implicit authentication (to translateuser behavior into authentication scores). The combination results in a new authenticationparadigm for users of mobile technologies; one where an appropriate balance betweenusability and trust can be managed through flexible policies and dynamic tuning.,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM workshop on Cloud computing security workshop,2010,142

Phantom: Practical oblivious computation in a secure processor,Martin Maas; Eric Love; Emil Stefanov; Mohit Tiwari; Elaine Shi; Krste Asanovic; John Kubiatowicz; Dawn Song,Abstract We introduce PHANTOM [1] a new secure processor that obfuscates its memoryaccess trace. To an adversary who can observe the processor's output pins; all memoryaccess traces are computationally indistinguishable (a property known as obliviousness).We achieve obliviousness through a cryptographic construct known as Oblivious RAM orORAM. We first improve an existing ORAM algorithm and construct an empirical model for itstrusted storage requirement. We then present PHANTOM; an oblivious processor whosenovel memory controller aggressively exploits DRAM bank parallelism to reduce ORAMaccess latency and scales well to a large number of memory channels. Finally; we build acomplete hardware implementation of PHANTOM on a commercially available FPGA-basedserver; and through detailed experiments show that PHANTOM is efficient in both area …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGSAC conference on Computer & communications security,2013,133

Practical dynamic proofs of retrievability,Elaine Shi; Emil Stefanov; Charalampos Papamanthou,Abstract Proofs of Retrievability (PoR); proposed by Juels and Kaliski in 2007; enable aclient to store n file blocks with a cloud server so that later the server can prove possessionof all the data in a very efficient manner (ie; with constant computation and bandwidth).Although many efficient PoR schemes for static data have been constructed; only twodynamic PoR schemes exist. The scheme by Stefanov et. al.(ACSAC 2012) uses a large ofamount of client storage and has a large audit cost. The scheme by Cash (EUROCRYPT2013) is mostly of theoretical interest; as it employs Oblivious RAM (ORAM) as a black box;leading to increased practical overhead (eg; it requires about 300 times more bandwidththan our construction). We propose a dynamic PoR scheme with constant client storagewhose bandwidth cost is comparable to a Merkle hash tree; thus being very practical.

Forexample; imagine a smart grid operator who wishes to aggregate the total powerconsumption of a neighborhood every ten minutes; or a market researcher who wishes totrack the fraction of population watching ESPN on an hourly basis. We design novelmechanisms that allow an aggregator to accurately estimate such statistics; while offeringprovable guarantees of user privacy against the untrusted aggregator.

Implicit authentication,*,Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method and system for implicitlyauthenticating a user to access controlled resources. The system receives a request toaccess the controlled resources. The system then determines a user behavior score basedon a user behavior model; and recent contextual data about the user. The user behaviorscore facilitates identifying a level of consistency between one or more recent user eventsand a past user behavior pattern. The recent contextual data; which comprise a plurality ofdata streams; are collected from one or more user devices without prompting the user toperform an action explicitly associated with authentication.

Circuit oram: On tightness of the goldreich-ostrovsky lower bound,Xiao Wang; Hubert Chan; Elaine Shi,Abstract We propose a new tree-based ORAM scheme called Circuit ORAM. Circuit ORAMmakes both theoretical and practical contributions. From a theoretical perspective; CircuitORAM shows that the well-known Goldreich-Ostrovsky logarithmic ORAM lower bound istight under certain parameter ranges; for several performance metrics. Therefore; we are thefirst to give an answer to a theoretical challenge that remained open for the past twenty-seven years. Second; Circuit ORAM earns its name because it achieves (almost) optimalcircuit size both in theory and in practice for realistic choices of block sizes. We demonstratecompelling practical performance and show that Circuit ORAM is an ideal candidate forsecure multi-party computation applications.,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2015,90
Permacoin: Repurposing bitcoin work for data preservation,Andrew Miller; Ari Juels; Elaine Shi; Bryan Parno; Jonathan Katz,Bit coin is widely regarded as the first broadly successful e-cash system. An oft-citedconcern; though; is that mining Bit coins wastes computational resources. Indeed; Bit coin'sunderlying mining mechanism; which we call a scratch-off puzzle (SOP); involvescontinuously attempting to solve computational puzzles that have no intrinsic utility. Wepropose a modification to Bit coin that repurposes its mining resources to achieve a morebroadly useful goal: distributed storage of archival data. We call our new scheme Perm coin.Unlike Bit coin and its proposed alternatives; Perm coin requires clients to invest not justcomputational resources; but also storage.

Signatures of correct computation,Charalampos Papamanthou; Elaine Shi; Roberto Tamassia,Abstract We introduce Signatures of Correct Computation (SCC); a new model for verifyingdynamic computations in cloud settings. In the SCC model; a trusted source outsources afunction f to an untrusted server; along with a public key for that function (to be used duringverification). The server can then produce a succinct signature σ vouching for thecorrectness of the computation of f; ie; that some result v is indeed the correct outcome of thefunction f evaluated on some point a. There are two crucial performance properties that wewant to guarantee in an SCC construction:(1) verifying the signature should takeasymptotically less time than evaluating the function f; and (2) the public key should beefficiently updated whenever the function changes. We construct SCC schemes (satisfyingthe above two properties) supporting expressive manipulations over multivariate …,*,2013,88
Multi-cloud oblivious storage,Emil Stefanov; Elaine Shi,Abstract We present a 2-cloud oblivious storage (ORAM) system that achieves 2.6 Xbandwidth cost between the client and the cloud. Splitting an ORAM across 2 or more non-colluding clouds allows us to reduce the client-cloud bandwidth cost by at least one order ofmagnitude; shifting the higher-bandwidth communication to in-between the clouds wherebandwidth provisioning is abundant. Our approach makes ORAM practical for bandwidth-constrained clients such as home or mobile Internet connections. We provide a full-fledgedimplementation of our 2-cloud ORAM system; and report results from a real-worlddeployment over Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Azure.,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGSAC conference on Computer & communications security,2013,84

Joint link prediction and attribute inference using a social-attribute network,Neil Zhenqiang Gong; Ameet Talwalkar; Lester Mackey; Ling Huang; Eui Chul Richard Shin; Emil Stefanov; Elaine Runting Shi; Dawn Song,Abstract The effects of social influence and homophily suggest that both network structureand node-attribute information should inform the tasks of link prediction and node-attributeinference.

Wedocument several typical classes of mistakes students made; suggest ways to fix/avoid them;and advocate best practices for programming smart contracts. Finally; our pedagogicalefforts have also resulted in online open course materials for programming smart contracts;which may be of independent interest to the community.,International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security,2016,74
SCORAM: oblivious RAM for secure computation,Xiao Shaun Wang; Yan Huang; TH Hubert Chan; Abhi Shelat; Elaine Shi,Abstract Oblivious RAMs (ORAMs) have traditionally been measured by their bandwidthoverhead and client storage. We observe that when using ORAMs to build securecomputation protocols for RAM programs; the size of the ORAM circuits is more relevant tothe performance.,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2014,72
Stubborn mining: Generalizing selfish mining and combining with an eclipse attack,Kartik Nayak; Srijan Kumar; Andrew Miller; Elaine Shi,Selfish mining; originally discovered by Eyal et al.[9]; is a well-known attack where a selfishminer; under certain conditions; can gain a disproportionate share of reward by deviatingfrom the honest behavior. In this paper; we expand the mining strategy space to includenovel" stubborn" strategies that; for a large range of parameters; earn the miner morerevenue. Consequently; we show that the selfish mining attack is not (in general) optimal.Further; we show how a miner can further amplify its gain by non-trivially composing miningattacks with network-level eclipse attacks. We show; surprisingly; that given the attacker'sbest strategy; in some cases victims of an eclipse attack can actually benefit from beingeclipsed!,Security and Privacy (EuroS&P); 2016 IEEE European Symposium on,2016,67
Oblivious data structures,Xiao Shaun Wang; Kartik Nayak; Chang Liu; TH Chan; Elaine Shi; Emil Stefanov; Yan Huang,Abstract We design novel; asymptotically more efficient data structures and algorithms forprograms whose data access patterns exhibit some degree of predictability. To this end; wepropose two novel techniques; a pointer-based technique and a locality-based technique.We show that these two techniques are powerful building blocks in making data structuresand algorithms oblivious. Specifically; we apply these techniques to a broad range ofcommonly used data structures; including maps; sets; priority-queues; stacks; deques; andalgorithms; including a memory allocator algorithm; max-flow on graphs with low doublingdimension; and shortest-path distance queries on weighted planar graphs. Our obliviouscounterparts of the above outperform the best known ORAM scheme both asymptoticallyand in practice.,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2014,66
Town crier: An authenticated data feed for smart contracts,Fan Zhang; Ethan Cecchetti; Kyle Croman; Ari Juels; Elaine Shi,Abstract Smart contracts are programs that execute autonomously on blockchains. Their keyenvisioned uses (eg financial instruments) require them to consume data from outside theblockchain (eg stock quotes). Trustworthy data feeds that support a broad range of datarequests will thus be critical to smart contract ecosystems. We present an authenticated datafeed system called Town Crier (TC). TC acts as a bridge between smart contracts andexisting web sites; which are already commonly trusted for non-blockchain applications. Itcombines a blockchain front end with a trusted hardware back end to scrape HTTPS-enabled websites and serve source-authenticated data to relying smart contracts.,Proceedings of the 2016 aCM sIGSAC conference on computer and communications security,2016,61
Onion ORAM: A constant bandwidth blowup oblivious RAM,Srinivas Devadas; Marten van Dijk; Christopher W Fletcher; Ling Ren; Elaine Shi; Daniel Wichs,Abstract We present Onion ORAM; an Oblivious RAM (ORAM) with constant worst-casebandwidth blowup that leverages poly-logarithmic server computation to circumvent thelogarithmic lower bound on ORAM bandwidth blowup. Our construction does not requirefully homomorphic encryption; but employs an additively homomorphic encryption schemesuch as the Damgård-Jurik cryptosystem; or alternatively a BGV-style somewhathomomorphic encryption scheme without bootstrapping. At the core of our construction is anORAM scheme that has “shallow circuit depth” over the entire history of ORAM accesses. Wealso propose novel techniques to achieve security against a malicious server; withoutresorting to expensive and non-standard techniques such as SNARKs. To the best of ourknowledge; Onion ORAM is the first concrete instantiation of a constant bandwidth …,Theory of Cryptography Conference,2016,61
Implicit authentication,*,Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method and system for implicitlyauthenticating a user to access controlled resources. The system first receives a request toaccess the controlled resource from a user. Then; the system determines whether the userrequest is inconsistent with regular user behavior by calculating a user behavior measurederived from historical contextual data of past user events. Next; responsive to thedetermined inconsistency of the user request; the system collects current contextual data ofthe user from one or more user devices without prompting the user to perform an explicitaction for authentication. The system further updates the user behavior measure based onthe collected current contextual data; and provides the updated user behavior measure to anaccess controller of the controlled resource to make an authentication decision based at …,*,2012,60
Ghostrider: A hardware-software system for memory trace oblivious computation,Chang Liu; Austin Harris; Martin Maas; Michael Hicks; Mohit Tiwari; Elaine Shi,Abstract This paper presents a new; co-designed compiler and architecture calledGhostRider for supporting privacy preserving computation in the cloud. GhostRider ensuresall programs satisfy a property called memory-trace obliviousness (MTO): Even an adversarythat observes memory; bus traffic; and access times while the program executes can learnnothing about the program's sensitive inputs and outputs. One way to achieve MTO is toemploy Oblivious RAM (ORAM); allocating all code and data in a single ORAM bank; and toalso disable caches or fix the rate of memory traffic. This baseline approach can beinefficient; and so GhostRider's compiler uses a program analysis to do better; allocatingdata to non-oblivious; encrypted RAM (ERAM) and employing a scratchpad when doing sowill not compromise MTO. The compiler can also allocate to multiple ORAM banks; which …,ACM SIGPLAN Notices,2015,58
Burst ORAM: Minimizing ORAM Response Times for Bursty Access Patterns.,Jonathan L Dautrich Jr; Emil Stefanov; Elaine Shi,Abstract We present Burst ORAM; the first oblivious cloud storage system to achieve bothpractical response times and low total bandwidth consumption for bursty workloads. For real-world workloads; Burst ORAM can attain response times that are nearly optimal and ordersof magnitude lower than the best existing ORAM systems by reducing online bandwidthcosts and aggressively rescheduling shuffling work to delay the bulk of the IO until idleperiods. We evaluate our design on an enterprise file system trace with about 7;500 clientsover a 15 day period; comparing to an insecure baseline encrypted block store withoutORAM. We show that when baseline response times are low; Burst ORAM response timesare comparably low. In a 32TB ORAM with 50ms network latency and sufficient bandwidthcapacity to ensure 90% of requests have baseline response times under 53ms; 90% of …,USENIX Security Symposium,2014,57
Constants Count: Practical Improvements to Oblivious RAM.,Ling Ren; Christopher W Fletcher; Albert Kwon; Emil Stefanov; Elaine Shi; Marten Van Dijk; Srinivas Devadas,Abstract Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is a cryptographic primitive that hides memory accesspatterns as seen by untrusted storage. This paper proposes Ring ORAM; the mostbandwidth-efficient ORAM scheme for the small client storage setting in both theory andpractice. Ring ORAM is the first tree-based ORAM whose bandwidth is independent of theORAM bucket size; a property that unlocks multiple performance improvements. First; RingORAM's overall bandwidth is 2.3× to 4× better than Path ORAM; the prior-art scheme forsmall client storage. Second; if memory can perform simple untrusted computation; RingORAM achieves constant online bandwidth (∼ 60× improvement over Path ORAM forpractical parameters). As a case study; we show Ring ORAM speeds up program completiontime in a secure processor by 1.5× relative to Path ORAM. On the theory side; Ring ORAM …,USENIX Security Symposium,2015,56
GraphSC: Parallel secure computation made easy,Kartik Nayak; Xiao Shaun Wang; Stratis Ioannidis; Udi Weinsberg; Nina Taft; Elaine Shi,We propose introducing modern parallel programming paradigms to secure computation;enabling their secure execution on large datasets. To address this challenge; we presentGraph SC; a framework that (i) provides a programming paradigm that allows non-cryptography experts to write secure code;(ii) brings parallelism to such secureimplementations; and (iii) meets the need for obliviousness; thereby not leaking any privateinformation. Using Graph SC; developers can efficiently implement an oblivious version ofgraph-based algorithms (including sophisticated data mining and machine learningalgorithms) that execute in parallel with minimal communication overhead. Importantly; oursecure version of graph-based algorithms incurs a small logarithmic overhead incomparison with the non-secure parallel version.

Differentially private continual monitoring of heavy hitters from distributed streams,T-H Hubert Chan; Mingfei Li; Elaine Shi; Wenchang Xu,Abstract We consider applications scenarios where an untrusted aggregator wishes tocontinually monitor the heavy-hitters across a set of distributed streams. Since each streamcan contain sensitive data; such as the purchase history of customers; we wish to guaranteethe privacy of each stream; while allowing the untrusted aggregator to accurately detect theheavy hitters and their approximate frequencies. Our protocols are scalable in settingswhere the volume of streaming data is large; since we guarantee low memory usage andprocessing overhead by each data source; and low communication overhead between thedata sources and the aggregator.,International Symposium on Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium,2012,51
The honey badger of BFT protocols,Andrew Miller; Yu Xia; Kyle Croman; Elaine Shi; Dawn Song,Abstract The surprising success of cryptocurrencies has led to a surge of interest indeploying large scale; highly robust; Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) protocols for mission-critical applications; such as financial transactions. Although the conventional wisdom is tobuild atop a (weakly) synchronous protocol such as PBFT (or a variation thereof); suchprotocols rely critically on network timing assumptions; and only guarantee liveness whenthe network behaves as expected. We argue these protocols are ill-suited for thisdeployment scenario. We present an alternative; HoneyBadgerBFT; the first practicalasynchronous BFT protocol; which guarantees liveness without making any timingassumptions. We base our solution on a novel atomic broadcast protocol that achievesoptimal asymptotic efficiency. We present an implementation and experimental results to …,Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2016,48
Do You Know Where Your Data Are? Secure Data Capsules for Deployable Data Protection.,Petros Maniatis; Devdatta Akhawe; Kevin R Fall; Elaine Shi; Dawn Song,Do you know where your data are? Who can see them? Who can modify them without atrace? Who can aggregate; summarize; and embed them for purposes other than yours? Wedon't; and we suspect neither do you. The problem is that we do not have a widely-availablemechanism to answer these questions; and yet; paradoxically; all evidence shows that itshould have been solved long ago. The problem is critical; incidents involving sensitive dataleakage; unauthorized access; and integrity violations (accidental or not) are a dailyoccurrence [1]. It is well known; as evidenced by the volume of relevant governmentregulation and pontification from privacy advocates. It is interesting; since it has inspiredmuch research into data confidentiality; integrity; and authorization.

Verifiable oblivious storage,Daniel Apon; Jonathan Katz; Elaine Shi; Aishwarya Thiruvengadam,Abstract We formalize the notion of Verifiable Oblivious Storage (VOS); where a clientoutsources the storage of data to a server while ensuring data confidentiality; access patternprivacy; and integrity and freshness of data accesses. VOS generalizes the notion ofOblivious RAM (ORAM) in that it allows the server to perform computation; and also explicitlyconsiders data integrity and freshness. We show that allowing server-side computationenables us to construct asymptotically more efficient VOS schemes whose bandwidthoverhead cannot be matched by any ORAM scheme; due to a known lower bound byGoldreich and Ostrovsky. Specifically; for large block sizes we can construct a VOS schemewith constant bandwidth per query; further; answering queries requires only poly-logarithmicserver computation. We describe applications of VOS to Dynamic Proofs of Retrievability …,International Workshop on Public Key Cryptography,2014,44
Signatures of reputation,John Bethencourt; Elaine Shi; Dawn Song,Abstract Reputation systems have become an increasingly important tool for highlightingquality information and filtering spam within online forums. However; the dependence of auser's reputation on their history of activities seems to preclude any possibility of anonymity.We show that useful reputation information can; in fact; coexist with strong privacyguarantees. We introduce and formalize a novel cryptographic primitive we call signatures ofreputation which supports monotonic measures of reputation in a completely anonymoussetting. In our system; a user can express trust in others by voting for them; collect votes tobuild up her own reputation; and attach a proof of her reputation to any data she publishes;all while maintaining the unlinkability of her actions.,International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security,2010,42

OverDoSe clients and servers areisolated at the IP level. Overlay nodes route packets between a client and a server; andregulate traffic according to the server's instructions. Through the use of light-weight securityprimitives; OverDoSe achieves resilience against compromised overlay nodes with aminimal performance overhead. OverDoSe can be deployed by a single ISP who wishes tooffer DDoS protection as a value-adding service to its customers.,Computer Science Department,2006,42
Authenticated data structures; generically,Andrew Miller; Michael Hicks; Jonathan Katz; Elaine Shi,Abstract An authenticated data structure (ADS) is a data structure whose operations can becarried out by an untrusted prover; the results of which a verifier can efficiently check asauthentic. This is done by having the prover produce a compact proof that the verifier cancheck along with each operation's result. ADSs thus support outsourcing data maintenanceand processing tasks to untrusted servers without loss of integrity. Past work on ADSs hasfocused on particular data structures (or limited classes of data structures); one at a time;often with support only for particular operations. This paper presents a generic method;using a simple extension to a ML-like functional programming language we call λ•(lambda-auth); with which one can program authenticated operations over any data structure definedby standard type constructors; including recursive types; sums; and products.

The ring of gyges: Investigating the future of criminal smart contracts,Ari Juels; Ahmed Kosba; Elaine Shi,Abstract Thanks to their anonymity (pseudonymity) and elimination of trusted intermediaries;cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have created or stimulated growth in many businesses andcommunities. Unfortunately; some of these are criminal; eg; money laundering; illicitmarketplaces; and ransomware. Next-generation cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum willinclude rich scripting languages in support of smart contracts; programs that autonomouslyintermediate transactions. In this paper; we explore the risk of smart contracts fueling newcriminal ecosystems. Specifically; we show how what we call criminal smart contracts(CSCs) can facilitate leakage of confidential information; theft of cryptographic keys; andvarious real-world crimes (murder; arson; terrorism). We show that CSCs for leakage ofsecrets (a la Wikileaks) are efficiently realizable in existing scripting languages such as …,Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2016,37
TRUESET: Faster Verifiable Set Computations.,Ahmed E Kosba; Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Charalampos Papamanthou; Mahmoud F Sayed; Elaine Shi; Nikos Triandopoulos,Abstract Verifiable computation (VC) enables thin clients to efficiently verify thecomputational results produced by a powerful server. Although VC was initially consideredto be mainly of theoretical interest; over the last two years impressive progress has beenmade on implementing VC. Specifically; we now have open-source implementations of VCsystems that handle all classes of computations expressed either as circuits or in the RAMmodel. Despite this very encouraging progress; new enhancements in the design andimplementation of VC protocols are required to achieve truly practical VC for real-worldapplications. In this work; we show that for functions that can be expressed efficiently interms of set operations (eg; a subset of SQL queries) VC can be enhanced to becomedrastically more practical: We present the design and prototype implementation of a novel …,USENIX Security Symposium,2014,35
Hybrid consensus: Efficient consensus in the permissionless model,Rafael Pass; Elaine Shi,Abstract Consensus; or state machine replication is a foundational building block ofdistributed systems and modern cryptography. Consensus in the classical;" permissioned"setting has been extensively studied in the 30 years of distributed systems literature. Recentdevelopments in Bitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies popularized a new form ofconsensus in a" permissionless" setting; where anyone can join and leave dynamically; andthere is no a-priori knowledge of the number of consensus nodes. So far; however; allknown permissionless consensus protocols assume network synchrony; ie; the protocolmust know an upper bound of the network's delay; and transactions confirm slower than thisa-priori upper bound. We initiate the study of the feasibilities and infeasibilities of achievingresponsiveness in permissionless consensus. In a responsive protocol; the transaction …,LIPIcs-Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics,2017,34
Memory trace oblivious program execution,Chang Liu; Michael Hicks; Elaine Shi,Cloud computing allows users to delegate data and computation to cloud service providers;at the cost of giving up physical control of their computing infrastructure. An attacker (eg;insider) with physical access to the computing platform can perform various physical attacks;including probing memory buses and cold-boot style attacks. Previous work on secure (co-)processors provides hardware support for memory encryption and prevents direct leakage ofsensitive data over the memory bus. However; an adversary snooping on the bus can stillinfer sensitive information from the memory access traces. Existing work on Oblivious RAM(ORAM) provides a solution for users to put all data in an ORAM; and accesses to an ORAMare obfuscated such that no information leaks through memory access traces. This method;however; incurs significant memory access overhead. This work is the first to leverage …,Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF); 2013 IEEE 26th,2013,33
Fruitchains: A fair blockchain,Rafael Pass; Elaine Shi,Abstract Nakamoto's famous blockchain protocol enables achieving consensus in a so-called permissionless setting---anyone can join (or leave) the protocol execution; and theprotocol instructions do not depend on the identities of the players. His ingenious protocolprevents" sybil attacks"(where an adversary spawns any number of new players) by relyingon computational puzzles (aka" moderately hard functions") introduced by Dwork and Naor(Crypto'92). Recent work by Garay et al (EuroCrypt'15) and Pass et al (manuscript; 2016)demonstrate that this protocol provably achieves consistency and liveness assuming a)honest players control a majority of the computational power in the network; b) the puzzle-hardness is appropriately set as a function of the maximum network delay and the totalcomputational power of the network; and c) the computational puzzle is modeled as a …,Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing,2017,32
Nonoutsourceable scratch-off puzzles to discourage bitcoin mining coalitions,Andrew Miller; Ahmed Kosba; Jonathan Katz; Elaine Shi,Abstract An implicit goal of Bitcoin's reward structure is to diffuse network influence over adiverse; decentralized population of individual participants. Indeed; Bitcoin's security claimsrely on no single entity wielding a sufficiently large portion of the network's overallcomputational power. Unfortunately; rather than participating independently; most Bitcoinminers join coalitions called mining pools in which a central pool administrator largelydirects the pool's activity; leading to a consolidation of power. Recently; the largest miningpool has accounted for more than half of network's total mining capacity. Relatedly;" hostedmining" service providers offer their clients the benefit of economies-of-scale; tempting themaway from independent participation. We argue that the prevalence of mining coalitions isdue to a limitation of the Bitcoin proof-of-work puzzle--specifically; that it affords an …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2015,32
Encore: Private; context-based communication for mobile social apps,Paarijaat Aditya; Viktor Erdélyi; Matthew Lentz; Elaine Shi; Bobby Bhattacharjee; Peter Druschel,Abstract Mobile social apps provide sharing and networking opportunities based on a user'slocation; activity; and set of nearby users. A platform for these apps must meet a wide rangeof communication needs while ensuring users' control over their privacy. In this paper; weintroduce EnCore; a mobile platform that builds on secure encounters between pairs ofdevices as a foundation for privacy-preserving communication. An encounter occurswhenever two devices are within Bluetooth radio range of each other; and generates aunique encounter ID and associated shared key. EnCore detects nearby users andresources; bootstraps named communication abstractions called events for groups ofproximal users; and enables communication and sharing among event participants; whilerelying on existing network; storage and online social network services.

Streaming authenticated data structures,Charalampos Papamanthou; Elaine Shi; Roberto Tamassia; Ke Yi,Abstract We consider the problem of streaming verifiable computation; where both a verifierand a prover observe a stream of n elements x 1; x 2;…; xn and the verifier can laterdelegate some computation over the stream to the prover. The prover must return the outputof the computation; along with a cryptographic proof to be used for verifying the correctnessof the output. Due to the nature of the streaming setting; the verifier can only keep small localstate (eg; logarithmic) which must be updatable in a streaming manner and with nointeraction with the prover. Such constraints make the problem particularly challenging andrule out applying existing verifiable computation schemes. We propose streamingauthenticated data structures; a model that enables efficient verification of data structurequeries on a stream. Compared to previous work; we achieve an exponential …,Annual International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques,2013,30

Locally decodable and updatable non-malleable codes and their applications,Dana Dachman-Soled; Feng-Hao Liu; Elaine Shi; Hong-Sheng Zhou,Abstract Non-malleable codes; introduced as a relaxation of error-correcting codes byDziembowski; Pietrzak and Wichs (ICS'10); provide the security guarantee that the messagecontained in a tampered codeword is either the same as the original message or is set to anunrelated value. Various applications of non-malleable codes have been discovered; andone of the most significant applications among these is the connection with tamper-resilientcryptography. There is a large body of work considering security against various classes oftampering functions; as well as non-malleable codes with enhanced features such asleakage resilience. In this work; we propose combining the concepts of non-malleability;leakage resilience; and locality in a coding scheme.

Efficient and secure threshold-based event validation for VANETs,Hsu-Chun Hsiao; Ahren Studer; Rituik Dubey; Elaine Shi; Adrian Perrig,Abstract Determining whether the number of vehicles reporting an event is above athreshold is an important mechanism for VANETs; because many applications rely on athreshold number of notifications to reach agreement among vehicles; to determine thevalidity of an event; or to prevent the abuse of emergency alarms. We present the firstefficient and secure threshold-based event validation protocol for VANETs. Quite counter-intuitively; we found that the z-smallest approach [3] offers the best tradeoff between securityand efficiency since other approaches perform better for probabilistic counting. Analysis andsimulation shows that our protocol provides> 99% accuracy despite the presence ofattackers; collection and distribution of alerts in less than 1 second; and negligible impact onnetwork performance.,Proceedings of the fourth ACM conference on Wireless network security,2011,24
Anonymous multi-attribute encryption with range query and conditional decryption,John Bethencourt; H Chan; Adrian Perrig; Elaine Shi; Dawn Song,Abstract We introduce the concept of Anonymous Multi-Attribute Encryption with RangeQuery and Conditional Decryption (AMERQCD). In AMERQCD; a plaintext is encryptedunder a point in multidimensional space. To a computationally bounded adversary; theciphertext hides both the plaintext and the point under which it is encrypted. In a rangequery; a master key owner releases the decryption key for an arbitrary hyper-rectangle inspace; thus allowing decryption of ciphertexts previously encrypted under any point withinthe hyper-rectangle. However; a computationally bounded adversary cannot learn anyinformation on ciphertexts outside the range covered by the decryption key (except the factthat they do not lie within this range). We give an efficient construction based on theDecision Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (D-BDH) and Decision Linear (D-Linear) assumption.,IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy,2006,23
Multi-client verifiable computation with stronger security guarantees,S Dov Gordon; Jonathan Katz; Feng-Hao Liu; Elaine Shi; Hong-Sheng Zhou,Abstract At TCC 2013; Choi et al. introduced the notion of multiclient verifiable computation(MVC) in which a set of clients outsource to an untrusted server the computation of a functionf over their collective inputs in a sequence of time periods. In that work; the authors definedand realized multi-client verifiable computation satisfying soundness against a maliciousserver and privacy against the semi-honest corruption of a single client. Very recently;Goldwasser et al.(Eurocrypt 2014) provided an alternative solution relying on multi-inputfunctional encryption. Here we conduct a systematic study of MVC; with the goal of satisfyingstronger security requirements. We begin by introducing a simulationbased notion ofsecurity that provides a unified way of defining soundness and privacy; and automaticallycaptures several attacks not addressed in previous work. We then explore the feasibility …,Theory of Cryptography Conference,2015,21
Scambaiter: Understanding targeted nigerian scams on craigslist,Youngsam Park; Jackie Jones; Damon McCoy; Elaine Shi; Markus Jakobsson,Abstract—Advance fee fraud scams; also known as Nigerian scams have evolved fromsimple untargeted email messages to more sophisticated scams targeted at users ofclassifieds; dating and other websites. Even though such scams are observed frequently; thecommunity's understanding of targeted Nigerian scam is limited since the scammers operate“underground”. In this paper; we focus on fake payment scams targeting users on Craigslist.To better understand this type of scam and associated scammers; we built an automateddata collection system. The system relied on what we term magnetic honeypotadvertisements. These are advertisements that are designed to attract scammers but repellegitimate users–similar to how a magnet attracts one side of a magnet but repels the other.Using advertisements of this type; we offered goods for sale on Craigslist; gathered scam …,system,2014,19

Formal abstractions for attested execution secure processors,Rafael Pass; Elaine Shi; Florian Tramer,Abstract Realistic secure processors; including those built for academic and commercialpurposes; commonly realize an “attested execution” abstraction. Despite being the de factostandard for modern secure processors; the “attested execution” abstraction has notreceived adequate formal treatment. We provide formal abstractions for “attested execution”secure processors and rigorously explore its expressive power. Our explorations show boththe expected and the surprising. On one hand; we show that just like the common belief;attested execution is extremely powerful; and allows one to realize powerful cryptographicabstractions such as stateful obfuscation whose existence is otherwise impossible evenwhen assuming virtual blackbox obfuscation and stateless hardware tokens. On the otherhand; we show that surprisingly; realizing composable two-party computation with …,Annual International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques,2017,17
Sealed-glass proofs: Using transparent enclaves to prove and sell knowledge,Florian Tramer; Fan Zhang; Huang Lin; Jean-Pierre Hubaux; Ari Juels; Elaine Shi,Trusted hardware systems; such as Intel's new SGX instruction set architecture extension;aim to provide strong confidentiality and integrity assurances for applications. Recent work;however; raises serious concerns about the vulnerability of such systems to side-channelattacks. We propose; formalize; and explore a cryptographic primitive called a Sealed-GlassProof (SGP) that models computation possible in an isolated execution environment withunbounded leakage; and thus in the face of arbitrary side-channels. A SGP specificallymodels the capabilities of trusted hardware that can attest to correct execution of a piece ofcode; but whose execution is transparent; meaning that an application's secrets and stateare visible to other processes on the same host. Despite this strong threat model; we showthat SGPs enable a range of practical applications. Our key observation is that SGPs …,Security and Privacy (EuroS&P); 2017 IEEE European Symposium on,2017,17
Context-centric security,Mohit Tiwari; Prashanth Mohan; Andrew Osheroff; Hilfi Alkaff; Elaine Shi; Eric Love; Dawn Song; Krste Asanović,Abstract Users today are unable to use the rich collection of third-party untrustedapplications without risking significant privacy leaks. In this paper; we argue that current andproposed applications and data-centric security policies do not map well to users'expectations of privacy. In the eyes of a user; applications and peripheral devices existmerely to provide functionality and should have no place in controlling privacy. Moreover;most users cannot handle intricate security policies dealing with system concepts such aslabeling of data; application permissions and virtual machines. Not only are current policiesimpenetrable to most users; they also lead to security problems such as privilege-escalationattacks and implicit information leaks. Our key insight is that users naturally associate datawith real-world events; and want to control access at the level of human contacts.

Optimal lower bound for differentially private multi-party aggregation,TH Hubert Chan; Elaine Shi; Dawn Song,Abstract We consider distributed private data analysis; where n parties each holding somesensitive data wish to compute some aggregate statistics over all parties' data. We prove atight lower bound for the private distributed summation problem. Our lower bound is strictlystronger than the prior lower-bound result by Beimel; Nissim; and Omri published inCRYPTO 2008. In particular; we show that any n-party protocol computing the sum withsparse communication graph must incur an additive error of Ω(n) with constant probability; inorder to defend against potential coalitions of compromised users. Furthermore; we showthat in the client-server communication model; where all users communicate solely with anuntrusted server; the additive error must be Ω(n); regardless of the number of messages orrounds.

Opaak: using mobile phones to limit anonymous identities online,Gabriel Maganis; Elaine Shi; Hao Chen; Dawn Song,Abstract Trust and anonymity are both desirable properties on the Internet. However; onlineservices and users often have to make the trade off between trust and anonymity due to thelack of usable frameworks for achieving them both. We propose Opaak; a practicalanonymous authentication framework. Opaak enables its users to establish identities withdifferent online services while ensuring that these identities cannot be linked with each otheror their real identity. In addition; Opaak allows online service providers to control the rate atwhich users utilize their services while preserving their anonymity. Hence; allowing theservice providers to prevent abuse in the form of spam or Sybil attacks; which are prevalentin such online services that offer anonymity. Opaak leverages the mobile phone as a scarceresource combined with anonymous credentials in order to provide these features.

Policy-enhanced private set intersection: sharing information while enforcing privacy policies,Emil Stefanov; Elaine Shi; Dawn Song,Abstract Companies; organizations; and individuals often wish to share information torealize valuable social and economic goals. Unfortunately; privacy concerns often stand inthe way of such information sharing and exchange. This paper proposes a novelcryptographic paradigm called Policy-Enhanced Private Set Intersection (PPSI); allowingtwo parties to share information while enforcing the desired privacy policies. Ourconstructions require minimal additional overhead over traditional Private Set Intersection(PSI) protocols; and yet we can handle rich policy semantics previously not possible withtraditional PSI and Authorized Private Set Intersection (APSI) protocols. Our schemeinvolves running a standard PSI protocol over carefully crafted encodings of elementsformed as part of a challenge-response mechanism.

Is it too late for PAKE?,John Engler; Chris Karlof; Elaine Shi; Dawn Song,The most common web authentication technique in use today is password authentication viaan HTML form; where a user types her password directly into a web page from the site towhich she wishes to authenticate herself. The problem with this approach is that it relies onthe user to determine when it is safe to enter her password. To resist phishing and othersocial engineering attacks; a user must rely on the browser's security indicators and warningmessages; eg; the URL bar and the site's SSL certificate; to authenticate the website anddetermine when it is safe to enter her password. Unfortunately; studies suggest that manyusers habitually click through SSL certificate warnings [7; 18] and misunderstand or ignorebrowser security indicators [5; 9; 17]. We revisit the idea of applying Password AuthenticatedKey Exchange (PAKE)[1; 2; 3; 4; 10; 12; 13] protocols to web authentication. A PAKE …,indicators,2009,16
Adaptively Secure Fully Homomorphic Signatures Based on Lattices.,Xavier Boyen; Xiong Fan; Elaine Shi,Abstract In a homomorphic signature scheme; given the public key and a vector ofsignatures σ:=(σ1;...; σl) over l messages µ:=(µ1;...; µl); there exists an efficient algorithm toproduce a signature σ for µ= f (µ). Given the tuple (σ; µ; f); anyone can then publicly verify thevalidity of the signature σ. Inspired by the recent (selectively secure) key-homomorphicfunctional encryption for circuits; recent works propose fully homomorphic signatureschemes in the selective security model. However; in order to gain adaptive security; onemust rely on generic complexity leveraging; which is not only very inefficient but also leadsto reductions that are “unfalsifiable”. In this paper; we construct the first adaptively securehomomorphic signature scheme that can evaluate any circuit over signed data. For poly-logarithmic depth circuits; our scheme achieves adaptive security under the standard …,IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive,2014,15
FastPRP: Fast Pseudo-Random Permutations for Small Domains.,Emil Stefanov; Elaine Shi,ABSTRACT We propose a novel small-domain pseudo-random permutation; also referred toas a small-domain cipher or smalldomain (deterministic) encryption. We prove that ourconstruction achieves “strong security”; ie; is indistinguishable from a random permutationeven when an adversary has observed all possible input-output pairs. More importantly; ourconstruction is 1;000 to 8;000 times faster in most realistic scenarios; in comparison with thebest known construction (also achieving strong security). Our implementation leverages theextended instruction sets of modern processors; and we also introduce a smart cachingstrategy to freely tune the tradeoff between time and space.,IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive,2012,15
The sleepy model of consensus,Rafael Pass; Elaine Shi,Abstract The literature on distributed computing (as well as the cryptography literature)typically considers two types of players—honest players and corrupted players. Resilienceproperties are then analyzed assuming a lower bound on the fraction of honest players.Honest players; however; are not only assumed to follow the prescribed the protocol; butalso assumed to be online throughout the whole execution of the protocol. The advent of“large-scale” consensus protocols (eg; the blockchain protocol) where we may have millionsof players; makes this assumption unrealistic. In this work; we initiate a study of distributedprotocols in a “sleepy” model of computation where players can be either online (awake) oroffline (asleep); and their online status may change at any point during the protocol. Themain question we address is: Can we design consensus protocols that remain resilient …,International Conference on the Theory and Application of Cryptology and Information Security,2017,14

SDDR: Light-Weight; Secure Mobile Encounters.,Matthew Lentz; Viktor Erdélyi; Paarijaat Aditya; Elaine Shi; Peter Druschel; Bobby Bhattacharjee,Abstract Emerging mobile social apps use short-range radios to discover nearby devicesand users. The device discovery protocol used by these apps must be highly energy-efficientsince it runs frequently in the background. Also; a good protocol must enable securecommunication (both during and after a period of device co-location); preserve user privacy(users must not be tracked by unauthorized third parties); while providing selective linkability(users can recognize friends when strangers cannot) and efficient silent revocation (userscan permanently or temporarily cloak themselves from certain friends; unilaterally andwithout re-keying their entire friend set).

A secure computation framework for SDNs,Nachikethas A Jagadeesan; Ranjan Pal; Kaushik Nadikuditi; Yan Huang; Elaine Shi; Minlan Yu,Software Defined Networking (SDN) introduces a logically centralized control plane to rundiverse management applications. In practice; a logically centralized control plane isrealized using multiple controllers for scalability; reliability; and availability reasons. In fact;for various current and future networks of interest; it is practically infeasible to attempt aphysically centralized SDN system. As SDN gains popularity; it is important to secure theSDN infrastructure to be resilient to potential attacks. In SDN; controllers can become high-value and attractive targets for an adversary for the following reasons. First; controllers aresinks of information collected from different switches. This includes network topology andflow-counter values. Such information can be privacy sensitive. For example; anorganization may wish to protect its internal network topology or hide what type of traffic is …,Proceedings of the third workshop on Hot topics in software defined networking,2014,12
Pseudonymous secure computation from time-lock puzzles,Jonathan Katz; Andrew Miller; Elaine Shi,Abstract In standard models of secure computation; point-to-point channels between partiesare assumed to be authenticated by some pre-existing means. In other cases; even strongerpre-existing setup—eg; a public-key infrastructure (PKI)—is assumed. These assumptionsare too strong for open; peer-to-peer networks; where parties do not necessarily have anyprior relationships and can come and go as they please. Nevertheless; these assumptionsare made due to the prevailing belief that nothing “interesting” can be achieved withoutthem. Taking inspiration from Bitcoin; we show that precise bounds on computational powercan be used in place of pre-existing setup to achieve weaker (but nontrivial) notions ofsecurity. Specifically; under the assumptions that digital signatures exist and each party cansolve cryptographic “time-lock” puzzles only at a bounded rate; we show that without prior …,*,2014,12
Constant-round MPC with fairness and guarantee of output delivery,S Dov Gordon; Feng-Hao Liu; Elaine Shi,Abstract We study the round complexity of multiparty computation with fairness andguaranteed output delivery; assuming existence of an honest majority. We demonstrate anew lower bound and a matching upper bound. Our lower bound rules out any two-roundfair protocols in the standalone model; even when the parties are given access to a commonreference string (CRS). The lower bound follows by a reduction to the impossibility result ofvirtual black box obfuscation of arbitrary circuits. Then we demonstrate a three-roundprotocol with guarantee of output delivery; which in general is harder than achieving fairness(since the latter allows the adversary to force a fair abort). We develop a new construction ofa threshold fully homomorphic encryption scheme; with a new property that we call “flexible”ciphertexts. Roughly; our threshold encryption scheme allows parties to adapt flexible …,Annual Cryptology Conference,2015,11
ObliviStore: High Performance Oblivious Distributed Cloud Data Store.,Emil Stefanov; Elaine Shi,It is well established that access patterns to encrypted data can leak a considerable amountof sensitive information [13]. Oblivious RAM (or ORAM for short)[5–11; 14; 18–20; 26; 28];originally proposed by Goldreich and Ostrovsky [8]; is a cryptographic construction thatallows a client to access encrypted data residing on an untrusted storage server; whilecompletely hiding the access patterns to storage. Particularly; the sequence of physicaladdresses accessed is independent of the actual data that the user is accessing. To achievethis; existing ORAM constructions [5–11; 14; 18–20; 26; 28] continuously re-encrypt and andreshuffle data blocks on the storage server; to cryptographically conceal the logical accesspattern.

How to Use SNARKs in Universally Composable Protocols.,Ahmed E Kosba; Zhichao Zhao; Andrew Miller; Yi Qian; T-H Hubert Chan; Charalampos Papamanthou; Rafael Pass; Abhi Shelat; Elaine Shi,Abstract The past several years have seen tremendous advances in practical; general-purpose; noninteractive proof systems called SNARKs.

However; while we would like to use these primitives in UC-secureprotocols—which are provably-secure even when composed with other arbitraryconcurrently-executing protocols—the SNARK definition is not directly compatible with thisframework; due to its use of non black-box knowledge extraction.

Server data storage is securely partitionedinto smaller electronic data storage partitions of predetermined size. The client sidemaintains a shuffling buffer and position map for these blocks as stored on the electronicdata storage partitions of the server. Concealment is performed with respect to accessesfrom the client to server using an oblivious sorting protocol. Access operation is concealedwith each block being randomly assigned to any of the data storage partitions; andwhenever a block is accessed; the block is logically removed from its current partition andlogically assigned to a fresh random partition selected from all partitions; while the clientmaintains tracking of which partition each block is associated with at any point of time.,*,2015,4

We achieve obliviousness through acryptographic construct known as Oblivious RAM or ORAM.

In this paper; we ask whether oblivious simulation of PRAMprograms can be further sped up if the OPRAM is allowed to have more CPUs than theoriginal PRAM. We thus initiate a study to understand the true depth of OPRAM schemes (ie;when the OPRAM may have access to unbounded number of CPUs).

Circuit OPRAM: A (Somewhat) Tight Oblivious Parallel RAM.,T-H Hubert Chan; Elaine Shi,Abstract An Oblivious Parallel RAM (OPRAM) provides a general method to simulate anyParallel RAM (PRAM) program; such that the resulting memory access patterns leak nothingabout secret inputs. OPRAM was originally proposed by Boyle et al. as the natural parallelcounterpart of Oblivious RAM (ORAM); which was shown to have broad applications; eg; incloud outsourcing; secure processor design; and secure multiparty computation. Sinceparallelism is common in modern computing architectures such as multi-core processors orcluster computing; OPRAM is naturally a powerful and desirable building block as much asits sequential counterpart ORAM is. Although prior work (in particular; Circuit ORAM) hasshown how to construct ORAM schemes that are asymptotically tight under certainparameter ranges; the performance of known OPRAM schemes still do not match their …,IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive,2016,2

Tacking together efficient authentication; revocation; and privacy in vanets (cmu-cylab-08-011),Ahren Studer; Elaine Shi; Fan Bai; Adrian Perrig,ABSTRACT Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) require some mechanism to helpauthenticate messages; identify valid vehicles; and remove malevolent vehicles. A PublicKey Infrastructure (PKI) can provide this functionality using certificates and fixed public keys.However; fixed keys allow an eavesdropper to associate a key with a vehicle and a location;violating drivers' privacy. In this work we examine a VANET key management scheme basedon Temporary Anonymous Certified Keys (TACKs). Our scheme efficiently preventseavesdroppers from linking a vehicle's different keys and provides timely revocation ofmisbehaving participants while maintaining the same or less overhead for vehicle-tovehiclecommunication as the current IEEE 1609.2 standard for VANET security.,*,2008,2

Bitter to Better—How to Make Bitcoin,Simon Barber; Xavier Boyen; Elaine Shi; Ersin Uzun,Abstract. Bitcoin is a distributed digital currency which has attracted a substantial number ofusers. We perform an in-depth investigation to understand what made Bitcoin so successful;while decades of research on cryptographic e-cash has not lead to a large-scaledeployment. We ask also how Bitcoin could become a good candidate for a long-lived stablecurrency. In doing so; we identify several issues and attacks of Bitcoin; and propose suitabletechniques to address them.,*,2012,1
PAKE-based web authentication: The good the bad and the hurdles,John Engler; Chris Karlof; Elaine Shi; Dawn Song,Abstract. Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) is a class of cryptographicprotocols that allow two parties sharing a password to authenticate each other withoutexplicitly revealing the password in the process. PAKE protocols offer a potentialimprovement over current web authentication practices; eg; HTML form-based passwordauthentication; but there has been little progress towards integrating PAKE into webbrowsers and servers. In this paper; we report the results of a systematic investigation ofvarious practical issues and challenges in deploying PAKE for web authentication. Weexamine three categories of issues: 1) security issues related to UI design; 2) security issuesrelated to the browser's same origin policy; and 3) potential hurdles to deployment. Wepropose potential solutions for some problems and identify areas for future work.,Proc. IEEE Web 2.0 Security Privacy Workshop,2009,1
TORM: a hybrid multicast infrastructure for interactive distance learning,Yi Che; Runting Shi; Yuanchun Shi,Multicast has been intensively studied over the past decade. Existing multicast servicescome in two-flavors; IP multicast and application level multicast; depending on which layerthe service is implemented on. After investigating the pros and cons of both approaches; aswell as the characteristics of interactive distance learning; we find it an imperative tocombine these two multicast approaches. In this paper; we present TORM (totally orderedreliable multicast); a hybrid multicast infrastructure for interactive distance learning. Apartfrom blending IP multicast and application level multicast; TORM builds and maintains a treestructure upon which transport functionalities are implemented; including a differentiatederror recovery service; flow and congestion control and global ordering,Multimedia and Expo; 2004.

Foundations of Differentially Oblivious Algorithms,TH Hubert Chan; Kai-Min Chung; Bruce Maggs; Elaine Shi,Abstract It is well-known that a program's memory access pattern can leak information aboutits input. To thwart such leakage; most existing works adopt the solution of oblivious RAM(ORAM) simulation. Such a notion has stimulated much debate. Some have argued that thenotion of ORAM is too strong; and suffers from a logarithmic lower bound on simulationoverhead. Despite encouraging progress in designing efficient ORAM algorithms; it wouldnonetheless be desirable to avoid the oblivious simulation overhead. Others have arguedthat obliviousness; without protection of length-leakage; is too weak; and have demonstratedexamples where entire databases can be reconstructed merely from length-leakage.Inspired by the elegant notion of differential privacy; we initiate the study of a new notion ofaccess pattern privacy; which we call “(ϵ; δ)-differential obliviousness”. We separate the …,*,*,1
PREPRINT: Nonoutsourceable Scratch-Off Puzzles to Discourage Bitcoin Mining Coalitions,Andrew Miller; Elaine Shi; Ahmed Kosba; Jonathan Katz,ABSTRACT An implicit goal of Bitcoin's reward structure is to diffuse network influence overa diverse; decentralized population of individual participants. Indeed; Bitcoin's securityclaims rely on no single entity wielding a sufficiently large portion of the network's overallcomputational power Unfortunately; rather than participating independently; most Bitcoinminers join coalitions called mining pools in which a central pool administrator largelydirects the pool's activity; leading to a consolidation of power. Recently; the largest miningpool; GHash. IO; has accounted for more than half of network's total mining capacity. 1Relatedly;“hosted mining” service providers offer their clients the benefit of economies-of-scale; tempting them away from independent participation. We argue that the prevalence ofmining coalitions is due to a limitation of the Bitcoin proof-of-work puzzle–specifically; that …,*,*,1

As an initial effort; weconsider a distributed summation problem. We first show a lower bound; that is; underinformation-theoretic differential privacy; any multi-party protocol with a small number ofmessages must have large additive error. We then show that by adopting a computationaldifferential privacy notion; one can circumvent this lower bound and design practicalprotocols for the periodic distributed summation problem. Our construction has severaldesirable features. First; it works in the client-server model and requires no peer-to-peercommunication among the clients.

Efficient Asynchronous Atomic Broadcast,Andrew Miller; Yu Xia; Kyle Croman; Elaine Shi; Dawn Song,Abstract The surprising success of cryptocurrencies has led to a surge of interest indeploying large scale; highly robust; Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) protocols for mission-critical applications; such as financial transactions. Although the conventional wisdom is tobuild atop a (weakly) synchronous protocol such as PBFT (or a variation thereof); suchprotocols rely critically on network timing assumptions; and only guarantee liveness whenthe network behaves as expected. We argue these protocols are ill-suited for thisdeployment scenario. We present an alternative; HoneyBadgerBFT; the first practicalasynchronous BFT protocol; which guarantees liveness without making any timingassumptions.

However; our understanding of the structure of rental scams is limited. Inthis paper; we conduct the first systematic empirical study of online rental scams onCraigslist. This study is enabled by a suite of techniques that allowed us to identify scamcampaigns and our automated system that is able to collect additional information byconversing with scammers. Our measurement study sheds new light on the broad range ofstrategies different scam campaigns employ and the infrastructure they depend on to profit.We find that many of these strategies; such as credit report scams; are structurally differentfrom the traditional advanced fee fraud found in previous studies. In addition; we find thatCraigslist remove less than half of the suspicious listings we detected. Finally; we find that …,International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security,2016,*

How to Authenticate any Data Structure,Andrew Miller; Michael Hicks; Jonathan Katz; Elaine Shi,ABSTRACT Hash-based Authenticated Data Structures (ADS) are a classic technique incryptography (beginning with Merkle's authenticated binary trees); and used widely incomputer security applications (including BitTorrent; Amazon Dynamo; and Bitcoin; just toname a few). An ADS allows a client to outsource storage of a data structure to an untrustedserver; the client can efficiently query the data structure remotely (without having to fetch allthe data) and can verify that the query result is correct. We give a thoroughly generictreatment of this technique using programming language theory: from any ordinary (purefunctional) data structure definition; we obtain a corresponding authenticated data structureprotocol [1].

In this paper; we argue that current andproposed applications and data-centric security policies do not map well to users'expectations of privacy. In the eyes of a user; applications and peripheral devices existmerely to provide functionality and should have no place in controlling privacy. Moreover;most users cannot handle intricate security policies dealing with system concepts such aslabeling of data; application permissions and virtual machines. Not only are current policiesimpenetrable to most users; they also lead to security problems such as privilege-escalationattacks and implicit information leaks.,*,2012,*

Usable authentication on mobile devices faces different challenges compared totraditional computers. For example; due to the constrained user interface; traditionalpasswords are awkward at best (see Section 7.2). Auxiliary hardware is generallycumbersome; but even more so for users on the go. We believe in the need for a newapproach to authenticating users. Extending the traditional authentication paradigm beyond“what you have—what you know—what you are;” we propose that “what you do” is apractical way to control access. We refer to this as implicit authentication; which identifiesusers by their habits; as opposed to their belongings; memorized data; and biometrics.,The Death of the Internet,2012,*

Can We Overcome the nlog n Barrier for Oblivious Sorting?,Wei-Kai Lin; Elaine Shi; Tiancheng Xie,Abstract It is well-known that non-comparison-based techniques can allow us to sort nelements in o (n log n) time on a Random-Access Machine (RAM). On the other hand; it is along-standing open question whether (non-comparison-based) circuits can sort n elementsfrom the domain [1.. 2k] with o (kn log n) boolean gates. We consider weakened forms of thisquestion: first; we consider a restricted class of sorting where the number of distinct keys ismuch smaller than the input length; and second; we explore Oblivious RAMs andprobabilistic circuit families; ie; computational models that are somewhat more powerful thancircuits but much weaker than RAM. We show that Oblivious RAMs and probabilistic circuitfamilies can sort o (log n)-bit keys in o (n log n) time or o (kn log n) circuit complexity where nis the input length.

After overtwo decades of time; in a recent ASIACRYPT'12 paper; Mizuki et al. were the first to improvethe scheme to 4 cards [9]. Although they mention that 4 cards is the minimum–the minimumonly holds when users must encode their input each with two cards.

Our students documented these solutions in a homeworkassignment; many of which are unanticipated by the instructor and the TAs.

We evaluate the performance of our oblivious data structures in terms of theirbandwidth overheads; and also when applied to a secure computation setting. Finally; weleverage our new framework to design an efficient oblivious memory allocator which isparticularly useful due to the community's recent efforts in compiling programs targetingORAM-capable secure processors.,*,*,*

Streaming Support for Multimodal Data in Smart Spaces,Yanhua Mao; Runting Shi; WeiKai Xie; Yuanchun Shi; Guangyou Xu,ABSTRACT The idea of ubiquitous computing and smart spaces is no longer a dream andhas long been an area of serious research. Various smart space projects have been built inresearch institutions all around the world. The Software Infrastructure of Smart Space (SISS);as an integral part of these projects; is to coordinate and manage numbers of software andhardware modules in the environment. The limitation of existent SSIS's; however; is that theyseldom provide streaming support for potential multimodal and multimedia applicationstransferring real-time data in Smart Space. In the Smart Classroom Project at the MultimediaLab of Tsinghua University; we integrated into our SISS; the Smart Platform; a stream-oriented communication scheme based on Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) and IPmulticast. It is a common solution that caters for the varied needs of several categories of …,*,*,*
