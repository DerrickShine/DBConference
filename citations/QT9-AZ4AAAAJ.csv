Towards supporting the life cycle of large scale scientific experiments,Marta Mattoso; Claudia Werner; Guilherme Horta Travassos; Vanessa Braganholo; Eduardo Ogasawara; Daniel Oliveira; Sergio Cruz; Wallace Martinho; Leonardo Murta,One of the main challenges of scientific experiments is to allow scientists to manage andexchange their scientific computational resources (data; programs; models; etc.). Theeffective management of such experiments requires a specific set of cardinal facilities; suchas experiment specification techniques; workflow derivation heuristics and provenancemechanisms. These facilities may characterise the experiment life cycle into three phases:composition; execution; and analysis. Works concerned with supporting scientific workflowsare mainly concerned with the execution and analysis phase. Therefore; they fail to supportthe scientific experiment throughout its life cycle as a set of integrated experimentationtechnologies. In large scale experiments this represents a research challenge. We proposean approach for managing large scale experiments based on provenance gathering …,International Journal of Business Process Integration and Management,2010,112
From XML view updates to relational view updates: old solutions to a new problem,Vanessa P Braganholo; Susan B Davidson; Carlos A Heuser,Abstract This paper addresses the question of updating relational databases through XMLviews. Using query trees to capture the notions of selection; projection; nesting; grouping;and heterogeneous sets found throughout most XML query languages; we show how XMLviews expressed using query trees can be mapped to a set of corresponding relationalviews. We then show how updates on the XML view are mapped to updates on thecorresponding relational views. Existing work on updating relational views can then beleveraged to determine whether or not the relational views are updatable with respect to therelational updates; and if so; to translate the updates to the underlying relational database.,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,90
Athena: A collaborative approach to requirements elicitation,Viviane Laporti; Marcos RS Borges; Vanessa Braganholo,Abstract The quality of the requirements is crucial for a project's success. Requirementselicitation; however; is not an easy task. Viewpoint; mental model and expectationdifferences among users and analysts make this task hard and conflicting. In many cases;the clients are not completely sure about their real needs. In others; the current work processdoes not correspond to management expectations. In this paper; we try to overcome theseproblems by presenting Athena; an approach founded on collective knowledge toprogressively build the system requirements from a narrative of user stories to the definitionof use cases. Athena is a collaborative approach to elicit requirements. It is based on groupstorytelling; where stakeholders tell stories about current and past systems that support agiven activity. The stories are merged to form a single story. Stories are then transformed …,Computers in Industry,2009,66
noWorkflow: capturing and analyzing provenance of scripts,Leonardo Murta; Vanessa Braganholo; Fernando Chirigati; David Koop; Juliana Freire,Abstract We propose noWorkflow; a tool that transparently captures provenance of scriptsand enables reproducibility. Unlike existing approaches; noWorkflow is non-intrusive anddoes not require users to change the way they work–users need not wrap their experimentsin scientific workflow systems; install version control systems; or instrument their scripts. Thetool leverages Software Engineering techniques; such as abstract syntax tree analysis;reflection; and profiling; to collect different types of provenance; including detailedinformation about the underlying libraries. We describe how noWorkflow captures multiplekinds of provenance and the different classes of analyses it supports: graph-basedvisualization; differencing over provenance trails; and inference queries.,International Provenance and Annotation Workshop,2014,61
Exploring many task computing in scientific workflows,Eduardo Ogasawara; Daniel de Oliveira; Fernando Chirigati; Carlos Eduardo Barbosa; Renato Elias; Vanessa Braganholo; Alvaro Coutinho; Marta Mattoso,Abstract One of the main advantages of using a scientific workflow management system(SWfMS) to orchestrate data flows among scientific activities is to control and register thewhole workflow execution. The execution of activities within a workflow with highperformance computing (HPC) presents challenges in SWfMS execution control. Currentsolutions leave the scheduling to the HPC queue system. Since the workflow executionengine does not run on remote clusters; SWfMS are not aware of the parallel strategy of theworkflow execution. Consequently; remote execution control and provenance registry of theparallel activities is very limited from the SWfMS side. This work presents a set ofcomponents to be included on the workflow specification of any SWMfS to controlparallelization of activities as MTC. In addition; these components can gather provenance …,Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Many-Task Computing on Grids and Supercomputers,2009,55
On the updatability of XML views over relational databases.,Vanessa P Braganholo; Susan B Davidson; Carlos A Heuser,ABSTRACT XML has become an important medium for data exchange; and is also used asan interface to–ie a view of–a relational database. While previous work has considered XMLviews for the purpose of querying relational databases (eg Silkroute); in this paper weconsider the problem of updating a relational database through an XML view. Using thenested relational algebra as the formalism for an XML view of a relational database; westudy the problem of when such views are updatable. Our results rely on the observation thatin many XML views of relational databases; the nest operator occurs last and the unnestoperator does not occur at all. Since in this case the nest operator is invertible; we canconsider this important class of XML views as if they were flat relational views.,WebDB,2003,48
Updating relational databases through XML views,Vanessa de Paula Braganholo; Carlos A Heuser; Cesar Roberto Mariano Vittori,Abstract: This paper discusses the problem of developing computer applications thatinternally handle data in XML format but store data in a relational database. The problem ofbuilding XML instances from relational databases is well known and several proposals arepresented in literature. However; most of these proposals do not solve the problem ofupdating the database through an XML view. In the paper; a language called R2X(Relations to XML) that allows the specification of updatable XML views over relationaldatabases is presented.,*,2001,47
Efficiently Processing XML Queries over Fragmented Repositories with PartiX,Alexandre Andrade; Gabriela Ruberg; Fernanda Baiao; Vanessa P Braganholo; Marta Mattoso,Abstract The data volume of XML repositories and the response time of query processinghave become critical issues for many applications; especially for those in the Web. Aninteresting alternative to improve query processing performance consists in reducing thesize of XML databases through fragmentation techniques. However; traditionalfragmentation definitions do not directly apply to collections of XML documents. This workformalizes the fragmentation definition for collections of XML documents; and shows theperformance of query processing over fragmented XML data. Our prototype; PartiX; exploitsintra-query parallelism on top of XQuery-enabled sequential DBMS modules. We haveanalyzed several experimental settings; and our results showed a performanceimprovement of up to a 72 scale up factor against centralized databases.,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2006,44
ProvManager: a provenance management system for scientific workflows,Anderson Marinho; Leonardo Murta; Cláudia Werner; Vanessa Braganholo; Sérgio Manuel Serra da Cruz; Eduardo Ogasawara; Marta Mattoso,SUMMARY Running scientific workflows in distributed and heterogeneous environmentshas been a motivating approach for provenance management; which is loosely coupled tothe workflow execution engine. This kind of approach is interesting because it allows bothstorage and access to provenance data in a homogeneous way; even in an environmentwhere different workflow management systems work together. However; current approachesoverload scientists with many ad hoc tasks; such as script adaptations and implementationsof extra functionalities to provide provenance independence.

Gerenciando experimentos científicos em larga escala,Marta Mattoso; Cláudia Werner; G Travassos; Vanessa Braganholo; Leonardo Murta,Abstract. Several scientific areas; such as bioinformatics and oil engineering; need means ofexecuting simulation-based experiments. The state of the practice for this; in most of thecases; consists in the execution of a set of programs. This; however; is not enough to dealwith the complexity imposed by the problems that need to be analyzed. This issue getsworse with largescale experiments. In this case; we need a system to manage thecomposition of processes and data in a coherent flux. Also; this system must be capable ofregistering the steps and parameters used in the well-succeeded executions of theexperiment. The main motivation of this paper is in identifying and analyzing the challengesthat need to be addressed to provide computational support to the development of large-scale scientific experiments.

Data parallelism in bioinformatics workflows using Hydra,Fábio Coutinho; Eduardo Ogasawara; Daniel De Oliveira; Vanessa Braganholo; Alexandre AB Lima; Alberto MR Dávila; Marta Mattoso,Abstract Large scale bioinformatics experiments are usually composed by a set of data flowsgenerated by a chain of activities (programs or services) that may be modeled as scientificworkflows. Current Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWfMS) are used toorchestrate these workflows to control and monitor the whole execution. It is very common inbioinformatics experiments to process very large datasets. In this way; data parallelism is acommon approach used to increase performance and reduce overall execution time.However; most of current SWfMS still lack on supporting parallel executions in highperformance computing (HPC) environments. Additionally keeping track of provenance datain distributed environments is still an open; yet important problem. Recently; Hydramiddleware was proposed to bridge the gap between the SWfMS and the HPC …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing,2010,29
Desafios no apoio à composição de experimentos científicos em larga escala,Marta Mattoso; Cláudia Werner; G Travassos; Vanessa Braganholo; Leonardo Murta; Eduardo Ogasawara; F Oliveira; Wallace Martinho,Abstract. Management of scientific experiments requires a set of specific functionalities. Oneof such functionalities is the support to experiment composition; which includes scientificworkflows conception. However; little support is given to: conception and instantiation forexecution in a Workflow Management System; reuse of workflows; control about theevolution of different workflow; and gathering of information for provenance of data. In thispaper we present solutions to some of these problems. Such solutions were obtained withSoftware Engineering and Databases Techniques.

Although a lot of work has been doneon querying relational databases through XML views; the problem of updating relationaldatabases through XML views has not received much attention. In this work; we map XMLviews expressed using a subset of XQuery to a corresponding set of relational views. Thus;we transform the problem of updating relational databases through XML views into aclassical problem of updating relational databases through relational views. We then showhow updates on the XML view are mapped to updates on the corresponding relationalviews. Existing work on updating relational views can then be leveraged to determinewhether or not the relational views are updatable with respect to the relational updates …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2006,25
A method for capturing innovation features using group storytelling,Rafael Escalfoni; Vanessa Braganholo; Marcos RS Borges,Abstract Innovation is the fundamental source of value creation in organizations. Despite itsimportance; many companies fail to systematize the innovation process. The innovationprocess depends on a complex combination of factors related to organizational culture;which are not easily identified. This paper proposes a collaborative method to identifyinnovation factors from a successful project that led to innovation. Our method uses groupstorytelling to capture; organize; and share organizational knowledge. We then use a set ofinnovation indicators to extract collaboratively innovation features from the gatheredknowledge. The method has been applied to a real project and generated a set of indicatorsto management.,Expert Systems with Applications,2011,21
Similarity-based workflow clustering,Vıtor Silva; Fernando Chirigati; Kely Maia; Eduardo Ogasawara; D Oliveira; Vanessa Braganholo; Leonardo Murta; Marta Mattoso,ABSTRACT Scientists have been using scientific workflow management systems (SWfMS) tosupport scientific experiments. However; SWfMS expect a modeled workflow to berepresented on its workflow language to be executed. The scientist does not have anassistance or guidance to obtain a modeled workflow. Experiment lines; which are a novelapproach to deal with these limitations; allow for the abstract representation and systematiccomposition of experiments. Since there are many scientific workflows already modeled andsuccessfully executed; they can be used to leverage the construction of new abstractrepresentations. These previous experiments can be helpful by identifying scientificworkflow clusters that are generated according to similarity criteria.

Processing queries over distributed XML databases,Guilherme Figueiredo; Vanessa Braganholo; Marta Mattoso,Abstract The increasing volume of data stored as XML documents makes fragmentationtechniques an alternative to the performance issues in query processing. Fragmenteddatabases are feasible only if there is a transparent way to query the distributed database.Fragments allow for intra-query parallel processing and data reduction. This paper presentsour methodology for XQuery query processing over distributed XML databases. Themethodology comprises the steps of query decomposition; data localization; and globaloptimization. This methodology can be used in an XML database or in a system thatpublishes homogeneous views of semi-autonomous databases. An implementation hasbeen done and experimental results can achieve performance improvements of up to 95%when compared to the centralized environment.,Journal of Information and Data Management,2010,21
A strategy for provenance gathering in distributed scientific workflows,Anderson Marinho; Cláudia Werner; Sérgio Manuel Serra da Cruz; Marta Mattoso; Vanessa Braganholo; Leonardo Murta,Running scientific workflows in distributed environments is motivating the definition ofprovenance approaches that are loosely coupled to the workflow system. This kind ofapproach is interesting because it allows both storage and access to provenance data in anintegrated way; even in an environment where different workflow management systems worktogether. In order to provide provenance functionalities; the existing approaches overloadscientists with many manually computing tasks; such as script adaptations andimplementations of extra functionalities. However; when we are dealing with users who donot have such expertise (the majority of scientists do not have it); this is not a good solution.Hence; the objective of this paper is to define a provenance strategy that facilitates thegathering of provenance information in a distributed environment scenario.,Services-I; 2009 World Conference on,2009,21

UXQuery: Building Updatable XML Views over Relational Databases.,Vanessa P Braganholo; Susan B Davidson; Carlos A Heuser,Abstract XML has become an important medium for data exchange; and is frequently usedas an interface to–ie a view of–a relational database. Although much attention has beenpaid to the problem of querying relational databases through XML views; the problem ofupdating relational databases through XML views has not been addressed. In this paper weinvestigate how a subset of XQuery can be used to build updatable XML views; so that anupdate to the view can be unambiguously translated to a set of updates on the underlyingrelational database; assuming that certain key and foreign key constraints hold. In particular;we show how views defined in this subset of XQuery can be mapped to a set of relationalviews; thus transforming the problem of updating relational databases through XML viewsinto a classical problem of updating relational databases through relational views.,SBBD,2003,17

ParGRES: a middleware for executing OLAP queries in parallel,Marta Mattoso; Geraldo Zimbrão; Alexandre AB Lima; Fernanda Baião; Vanessa P Braganholo; Albino Aveleda; Bernardo Miranda; Bruno Kinder Almentero; Marcelo Nunes Costa,ABSTRACT ParGRES is a middleware aimed to efficiently process heavy weight queries;typical of OLAP; on top of a database cluster. ParGRES achieves query processing speed-up through intra-and inter-query parallelism in a PC cluster environment with databasereplication and virtual partitioning. It accelerates both individual queries and systemthroughput. Our experimental results show that ParGRES yields super-linear or near-linearspeed-up.

Collecting and analyzing provenance on interactive notebooks: when IPython meets noWorkflow,João Felipe Nicolaci Pimentel; Vanessa Braganholo; Leonardo Murta; Juliana Freire,Abstract Interactive notebooks help users explore code; run simulations; visualize results;and share them with other people. While these notebooks have been widely adopted inteaching as well as by scientists and data scientists that perform exploratory analyses; theirprovenance support is limited to the visualization of some intermediate results and codesharing. Once a user arrives at a result; it is hard; and sometimes impossible; to retrace thesteps that led to the result; since they do not collect the provenance for intermediate resuls orof the environment. As a result; users must fulfill this gap using external tools such asworkflow management systems. To overcome this limitation; we propose a new approach tocapture provenance from notebooks.

ARAXA: Storing and managing Active XML documents,Cláudio Ananias Ferraz; Vanessa Braganholo; Marta Mattoso,Abstract Active XML (AXML) documents combine extensional XML data with intentional datadefined through Web service calls. The dynamic properties of these documents posechallenges to both storage and data materialization techniques. In this paper; we presentARAXA; a non-intrusive approach to store and manage AXML documents. We also define amethodology to materialize AXML documents at query time. The storage approach ofARAXA is based on plain relational tables and user-defined functions of Object-RelationalDBMS to trigger the service calls. By using a DBMS we benefit from efficient storage toolsand query optimization. Approaches without DBMS support have to process XML in mainmemory or provide for virtual memory solutions.

A P2P approach to many tasks computing for scientific workflows,Eduardo Ogasawara; Jonas Dias; Daniel Oliveira; Carla Rodrigues; Carlos Pivotto; Rafael Antas; Vanessa Braganholo; Patrick Valduriez; Marta Mattoso,Abstract Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWfMS) are being used intensively tosupport large scale in silico experiments. In order to reduce execution time; current SWfMShave exploited workflow parallelization under the arising Many Tasks Computing (MTC)paradigm in homogeneous computing environments; such as multiprocessors; clusters andgrids with centralized control. Although successful; this solution no longer applies toheterogeneous computing environments; such as hybrid clouds; which may combine users'own computing resources with multiple edge clouds. A promising approach to address thischallenge is Peer-to-Peer (P2P) which relies on decentralized control to deal with scalabilityand dynamic behavior of resources.

Scientific workflow management system applied to uncertainty quantification in large eddy simulation,Gabriel Guerra; Fernando Rochinha; Renato Elias; Alvaro Coutinho; Vanessa Braganholo; D de Oliveira; Eduardo Ogasawara; Fernando Chirigati; Marta Mattoso,Abstract. Currently Large Eddy Simulation (LES) requires intensive computation and a lot ofdata management. Today this management is often carried out in a case by case basis andrequires great effort to track it. This is due to the large amount of data involved; thus makingthis process prone to errors. Moreover; there is a need to explore parameter variability (eg;eddy viscosities) for the same set of data. In this context; techniques and methodologies ofscientific workflows can improve the management of simulations. This variability can be putin the general context of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ); which provides a rationalperspective for analysts and decision makers.

Virtual partitioning ad-hoc queries over distributed XML databases,Carla Rodrigues; Vanessa Braganholo; Marta Mattoso,Abstract XML query processing on large repositories suffers from performance issues.Despite many efficient indexing techniques; oftentimes only physical XML datafragmentation techniques can improve query processing performance. In such approaches;the database is physically partitioned based on the attributes and selection criteria used inthe most frequent queries of the system. Distributed query processing can then takeadvantage of pruning irrelevant fragments and processing the relevant ones in parallel.However; in many applications; such as Decision Support Systems; input queries are ad-hoc. In such cases; there is no frequent attribute access and physical partitioning is not anoption. In relational settings; virtual partitioning has been successfully used to improveperformance in such scenario with parallel query processing.

Running scientific workflows in distributed environments is motivating the definitionof provenance gathering approaches that are loosely coupled to the workflow systems. Wehave proposed a provenance gathering strategy that is independent from workflow systemtechnology. This strategy has evolved into a provenance management system namedProvManager. The main principle is that each workflow activity should collect its ownprovenance data and publish them in a repository which scientists can access to make theirqueries. In this paper we show how provenance is captured along distributedheterogeneous systems. Two main strategies are used to capture provenance: using Prologpredicates to register provenance; and using an API for the communication between thewrapped activity and the ProvManager.,International Workshop on Challenges in e-Science-SBAC,2010,8

Fragmented databases are feasible only if there is a transparentway to query the distributed database; without the need of knowing the fragmentation detailsand where each fragment is located. This paper presents our methodology for XQuery queryprocessing over distributed XML databases; which consists on the steps of querydecomposition; including the query's TLC algebra representation; data localization; globaloptimization; global query execution and final result assembly. This methodology can beused in an XML database that allows fragmentation and also in a system that publishes anintegrated view of semi-autonomous and homogeneous XML databases. We propose an …,*,2007,7

Fine-grained provenance collection over scripts through program slicing,João Felipe Pimentel; Juliana Freire; Leonardo Murta; Vanessa Braganholo,Abstract Collecting provenance from scripts is often useful for scientists to explain andreproduce their scientific experiments. However; most existing automatic approachescapture provenance at coarse-grain; for example; the trace of user-defined functions. Theseapproaches lack information of variable dependencies. Without this information; users maystruggle to identify which functions really influenced the results; leading to the creation offalse-positive provenance links. To address this problem; we propose an approach that usesdynamic program slicing for gathering provenance of Python scripts. By capturingdependencies among variables; it is possible to expose execution paths inside functionsand; consequently; to create a provenance graph that accurately represents the functionactivations and the results they affect.,International Provenance and Annotation Workshop,2016,6
Analyzing provenance across heterogeneous provenance graphs,Wellington Oliveira; Paolo Missier; Kary Ocaña; Daniel de Oliveira; Vanessa Braganholo,Abstract Provenance generated by different workflow systems is generally expressed usingdifferent formats. This is not an issue when scientists analyze provenance graphs inisolation; or when they use the same workflow system. However; when analyzingheterogeneous provenance graphs from multiple systems poses a challenge. To addressthis problem we adopt ProvONE as an integration model; and show how differentprovenance databases can be converted to a global ProvONE schema. Scientists can thenquery this integrated database; exploring and linking provenance across several differentworkflows that may represent different implementations of the same experiment. To illustratethe feasibility of our approach; we developed conceptual mappings between theprovenance databases of two workflow systems (e-Science Central and SciCumulus). We …,International Provenance and Annotation Workshop,2016,6
SciMulator: Um Ambiente de Simulação de Workflows Científicos em Redes P2P,Jonas Dias; Carla Rodrigues; Eduardo Ogasawara; Daniel De Oliveira; Vanessa Braganholo; Esther Pacitti; Marta Mattoso,The growth of large-scale scientific experiments motivates the search for computingenvironments that support the parallelization of computing activities; particularly those thatcomplies to the Many Task Computing (MTC) paradigm. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) environmentscan meet this demand due to the easy access and distributed control. However; building areal P2P infrastructure to evaluate this solution is very costly. Within this context; we presentthe simulator SciMulator developed to evaluate P2P architectures. We present the modelingof the simulator and an initial assessment of its performance when using the SciMulearchitecture for submission of scientific workflows activities on P2P networks.,VI Workshop de Redes Dinâmicas e Sistemas Peer-to-Peer 2010,2010,6
A survey on xml fragmentation,Vanessa Braganholo; Marta Mattoso,Abstract Efficient document processing is a must when large volumes of XML data areinvolved. In such critical scenarios; a well-known solution to this problem is to distribute(map) the data among several processing nodes; and then distribute the processingaccordingly; taking advantage of parallelism. This is the approach taken by distributeddatabases and MapReduce environments. Fragmentation techniques play an important rolein these scenarios. They provide a way to" cut" the database into pieces and distribute thepieces over a network. This way; queries can also be" cut" into sub-queries that run inparallel; thus achieving better performance when compared to the centralized environment.However; there is no consensus in the database community as to what an XML fragment is.In fact; several approaches in literature present definitions of XML fragments.

Uma Comparação entre os Modelos de Proveniência OPM e PROV,Bárbara Bivar; Lucas Santos; Troy C Kohwalter; Anderson Marinho; Marta Mattoso; Vanessa Braganholo,Abstract. The large scale production of digital scientific objects involves a variety ofprocesses. The analysis of these processes and its results demands a rigorousmanagement of the changes that occurs throughout its execution. The OPM model hasemerged as a reference to represent the provenance of various systems such as databases;web and scientific workflows and was widely adopted. However; an initiative from W3C todefine a provenance model named PROV has recently emerged and so many systemsbased on OPM will probably migrate to PROV. The contribution of this work is a comparativestudy that aims to ease the migration of the current systems based on OPM to the PROVmodel. Resumo.

Implicit Provenance Gathering through Configuration Management,Vitor C Neves; Vanessa Braganholo; Leonardo Murta,Scientific experiments based on computer simulations usually consume and produce hugeamounts of data. Data provenance is used to help scientists answer queries related to howexperiment data were generated or changed. However; during the experiment execution;data not explicitly referenced by the experiment specification may lead to an implicit dataflow missed by the existing provenance gathering infrastructures. This paper introduces anovel approach to gather and store implicit data flow provenance through configurationmanagement. Our approach opens some new opportunities in terms of provenanceanalysis; such as identifying implicit data flows; identifying data transformations along anexperiment trial; comparing data evolution in different trials of the same experiment; andidentifying side effects on data evolution caused by implicit data flows.,International Workshop on Software Engineering for Computational Science and Engineering (SECSE),2013,5
Challenges in managing implicit and abstract provenance data: experiences with ProvManager,Anderson Marinho; Marta Mattoso; Claudia Werner; Vanessa Braganholo; Leonardo Murta,Abstract Running scientific workflows in distributed and heterogeneous environments hasbeen motivating the definition of provenance gathering approaches that are loosely coupledto workflow management systems. We have developed a provenance management systemnamed ProvManager to manage provenance data in distributed and heterogeneousenvironments independent of a specific Scientific Workflow Management System. Theexperience of using ProvManager in real workflow applications has shown manyprovenance management issues that are not addressed in current related work. We havefaced challenges such as the necessity of dealing with implicit provenance data and the lackof higher provenance abstraction levels.

Tracking and analyzing the evolution of provenance from scripts,João Felipe Pimentel; Juliana Freire; Vanessa Braganholo; Leonardo Murta,Abstract Script languages are powerful tools for scientists. Scientists use them to processdata; invoke programs; and link program outputs/inputs. During the life cycle of scientificexperiments; scientists compose scripts; execute them; and perform analysis on the results.Depending on the results; they modify their script to get more data to confirm the originalhypothesis or to test a new hypothesis; evolving the experiment. While some tools captureprovenance from the execution of scripts; most approaches focus on a single execution;leaving out the possibility to analyze the provenance evolution of the experiment as a whole.This work enables tracking and analyzing the provenance evolution gathered from scripts.Tracking the provenance evolution also helps to reconstruct the environment of previousexecutions for reproduction.

Captura e Consulta a Dados de Proveniência Retrospectiva Implícita Intra-Atividade.,Wellington Moreira de Oliveira; Vitor C Neves; Kary ACS Ocaña; Leonardo Murta; Daniel de Oliveira; Vanessa Braganholo,Abstract. Executing scientific experiments in large scale generates huge amounts of datathat should be captured for future query. However; most of the available tools collect onlypart of the provenance (ie; only that which is explicitly defined in the workflow specification);leading to loss of important information to the analysis of the experiment. This work presentsan approach for collecting; storing; and querying intra-activity provenance obtained bymonitoring the directories and files manipulated by activities of the workflow. Therefore;information not referenced in the workflow specification are captured and related withpreviously specified provenance. Resumo.

Extracting new relations to improve ontology reuse,Miguel GP de Carvalho; Linair M Campos; Vanessa Braganholo; Maria Luiza M Campos; Maria Luiza A Campos,Abstract Ontologies reuse in biomedicine faces several challenges; which include thecomplexity of the domain and the articulation of different vocabularies; many of them withthousands of terms. Those ontologies are still subject to changes to improve their quality andto solve existing deficiencies. Among them; we highlight the problem of concepts that shouldbe related; according to their definition; but are not explicitly connected through relations inthe ontology. This could hinder ontology comprehension and limit the scope of the domainrepresented by the vocabulary; which can eventually encourage the development of newontologies instead of reusing existing ones. Due to these issues; the adoption of ontologytools to support the discovery of implicit relations; intra and inter ontologies; is stronglyrecommended. Although there are tools geared to find new relationships in ontologies …,Journal of Information and Data Management,2011,4
Uma nova abordagem para consulta a dados de proveniência,P Costa; Vanessa Braganholo,Abstract. One of the most important features of scientific experiments is the reproducibility.To achieve reproducibility; scientists have been automating their experiments usingscientific workflows which allows provenance data to be automatically captured. Provenancedescribes the origin of a piece of data (program and parameters used to generate it; the userwho ran the program; date and time; among others). However; there is no point in collectingthis data is it cannot be queried satisfactorily. The problem is that to query this data is notalways an easy task; since it requires scientists' to have expertise on specific querylanguages; which they usually do not have. This work proposes a method for assemblingprovenance queries aiming at reducing the effort of scientists.,Workshop de Teses e Dissertações em Banco de Dados (WTDBD). Belo Horizonte; MG,2010,4
Using XML with Large Parallel Datasets: Is There Any Hope?,RN Elias; Vanessa Braganholo; Jerry Clarke; IHF SANTOS; M MATTOSO; ALGA COUTINHO,ABSTRACT The e-Science area has been calling attention of computer scientists to severalchallenges in supporting large scale scientific experiments. One of them is datarepresentation. Providing scientists with efficient data access starts by choosing the bestalternative to represent such data. An alternative concerned with data interoperability isnecessary in such scenario. This paper evaluates XDMF as an XML-based alternative torepresent data in large scale parallel CFD applications. In this format; data considered as“heavy” is stored in bi-nary files; while all information required to data access is stored inXML files; inheriting XML's flexibility; interoperability between different applications; self-description and easyof-access.

Desmistificando XML: da pesquisa à prática industrial,Mirella Moro; Vanessa Braganholo,XML is a language for specifying semi or completely structured data. It has been widely exploredby both research and industry communities. Eleven years after its proposal; XML has solvedsome really important problems and it did so beautifully. Moreover; XML is adopted as a standardlanguage by many industries and research communities for exchanging data; varying from retailto healthcare; and including current applications such as Web Science and M-Government. Thischapter is intended to people who would like to do research on XML or simply to study XML fromthe research or the industry point-of-view. It summarizes the main current uses of XML; the researchproblems it has helped to solve; and the issues that are still open. Note that this chapter is notintended to cover the whole vast literature on XML.

Storing AXML documents with ARAXA.,Cláudio Ananias Ferraz; Vanessa P Braganholo; Marta Mattoso,Abstract. Active XML (AXML) documents combine extensional XML data with intentionaldata defined through Web service calls. The dynamic properties of these documents posechallenges to both storage and data materialization techniques. We present ARAXA; a non-intrusive approach to store AXML documents. It takes advantage of complex objects fromobject-relational DBMS to represent both extensional and intentional data. By using a DBMSwe benefit from efficient storage tools and query engine. We have defined a storagemechanism with a methodology to materialize AXML documents at query time. We have alsoimplemented a prototype of ARAXA. Our experimental results show that our approach isscalable and extensible.,SBBD,2007,4

Such specifications containprecious knowledge that can be reused to produce new workflows. It is a fact thatprovenance data can help reusing third party code. However; finding the dependenciesamong programs without the support of a tool is not a trivial activity and; in many cases;becomes a barrier to build more sophisticated models and analysis. Due to the hugenumber of task versions available and their configuration parameters; this activity is highlyerror prone and counterproductive. In this work; we propose workflow recommender (WR); arecommendation service that aims at suggesting frequent combinations of workflow tasks forreuse.

From XML to Relational View Updates: applying old solutions to solve a new problem,Vanessa de Paula Braganholo,XML has become an important medium for data exchange; and is frequently used as aninterface to-ie a view of-a relational database. Although lots of work have been done onquerying relational databases through XML views; the problem of updating relationaldatabases through XML views has not received much attention. In this work; we give the rststeps towards solving this problem. Using query trees to capture the notions of selection;projection; nesting; grouping; and heterogeneous sets found throughout most XML querylanguages; we show how XML views expressed using query trees can be mapped to a set ofcorresponding relational views. Thus; we transform the problem of updating relationaldatabases through XML views into a classical problem of updating relational databasesthrough relational views. We then show how updates on the XML view are mapped to …,*,2004,3
Using XQuery to build updatable XML views over relational databases,Vanessa P Braganholo; Susan B Davidson; Carlos A Heuser,Abstract XML has become an important medium for data exchange; and is frequently usedas an interface to-ie a view of-a relational database. Although much attention has been paidto the problem of querying relational databases through XML views; the problem of updatingrelational databases through XML views has not been addressed. In this paper weinvestigate how a subset of XQuery can be used to build updatable XML views; so that anupdate to the view can be unambiguously translated to a set of updates on the underlyingrelational database; assuming that certain key and foreign key constraints hold. In particular;we show how views defined in this subset of XQuery can be mapped to a set of relationalviews; thus transforming the problem of updating relational databases through XML viewsinto a classical problem of updating relational databases through relational views.,Technical Reports (CIS),2003,3
Deriving scientific workflows from algebraic experiment lines: A practical approach,Anderson Marinho; Daniel de Oliveira; Eduardo Ogasawara; Vitor Silva; Kary Ocaña; Leonardo Murta; Vanessa Braganholo; Marta Mattoso,Abstract The exploratory nature of a scientific computational experiment involves executingvariations of the same workflow with different approaches; programs; and parameters.However; current approaches do not systematize the derivation process from the experimentdefinition to the concrete workflows and do not track the experiment provenance down to theworkflow executions. Therefore; the composition; execution; and analysis for the entireexperiment become a complex task. To address this issue; we propose the AlgebraicExperiment Line (AEL). AEL uses a data-centric workflow algebra; which enriches theexperiment representation by introducing a uniform data model and its correspondingoperators. This representation and the AEL provenance model map concepts from theworkflow execution data to the AEL derived workflows with their corresponding …,Future Generation Computer Systems,2017,2
Towards recommendations for horizontal XML fragmentation,Tatiane Lima da Silva; Fernanda Baião; Jonice de Oliveira Sampaio; Marta Mattoso; Vanessa Braganholo,Abstract The large amount of XML data available on the web and inside organizationsmakes the performance of query processing a big concern. Several techniques can beapplied to improve query processing performance; including indexing and data distribution.The increasing popularity of clouds; clusters and grids makes data distribution a feasiblealternative. In these approaches; data is fragmented and distributed to several nodes; andqueries submitted by users are processed in parallel; thus improving performance. However;the problem of how to fragment an XML database has not been adequately addressed.There are lots of definitions for XML fragments in the literature; but few proposals focus onhow to use those definitions to actually fragment the database–a process calledfragmentation design.

Managing Provenance of Implicit Data Flows in Scientific Experiments,Vitor C Neves; Daniel De Oliveira; Kary ACS Ocaña; Vanessa Braganholo; Leonardo Murta,Abstract Scientific experiments modeled as scientific workflows may create; change; oraccess data products not explicitly referenced in the workflow specification; leading toimplicit data flows. The lack of knowledge about implicit data flows makes the experimentshard to understand and reproduce. In this article; we present ProvMonitor; an approach thatidentifies the creation; change; or access to data products even within implicit data flows.ProvMonitor links this information with the workflow activity that generated it; allowing forscientists to compare data products within and throughout trials of the same workflow;identifying side effects on data evolution caused by implicit data flows.

On the performance of the position () XPath function,Luiz Augusto Matos da Silva; Laerte N da Silva Jr; Marta Mattoso; Vanessa Braganholo,Abstract In very large XML documents or collections; the query response times are notalways satisfactory. To overcome this limitation; parallel processing can be applied. Datacan be replicated in several processors and queries can be partitioned to run over differentvirtual data partitions on each processor; on an approach called virtual partitioning. PartiX-VP is a simple XML virtual partitioning approach that generates virtual data partitions bydividing the cardinality of the partitioning attribute by the number of allocated processors;resulting in intervals of equal size for each processor. In this approach; the XML query isrewritten and selection predicates are added to define the virtual partitions. These selectionpredicates use the position () XPath function that addresses a set of elements on a givenposition in the document. In this paper; we present an experimental evaluation of the …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM symposium on Document engineering,2013,1

Uma Abordagem Colaborativa para a Identificação de Fatores que Influenciam a Inovação,Rafael EL Escalfoni; Denise PN Machado; Vanessa Braganholo; Marcos RS Borges,Resumo—Ultimamente inovação vem sendo tratada como um fator essencial para odesenvolvimento de organizações e geração de riquezas. Porém; a complexidade inerenteao processo tem se mostrado um duro obstáculo para a difusão de inovações nasempresas. Não existe uma fórmula mágica para inovar; empresas reconhecidamenteinovadoras possuem diferentes processos de inovação. Isto porque inovação estáintimamente ligada à cultura organizacional. Neste artigo propomos um método para aidentificação de padrões que influenciam o ambiente de inovação através de uma dinâmicacolaborativa para recuperação e análise de conhecimento sobre experiências inovadoras.,Simpósio Brasileiro de Sistemas Colaborativos (SBSC),2009,1
Identifying Innovation with Group StoryTelling,Rafael Escalfoni; Vanessa Braganholo; Marcos RS Borges,Abstract: Innovation is the fundamental source of value creation in organizations. Despite itsimportance; many companies fail to systematize the process of innovation. The innovationprocess depends on a complex combination of factors related to organizational culture;which are not easily identified. This paper proposes a collaborative approach to identifysuch factors through group storytelling.,*,2008,1
Conflict Resolution in Updates Through XML Views,Andre Prisco Vargas; Vanessa P Braganholo; Carlos A Heuser,Abstract In this paper; we focus on B2B scenarios where XML views are extracted fromrelational databases and sent over the Web to another application that edits them and sendsthem back after a certain (usually long) period of time. In such transactions; it is unrealistic tolock the base tuples that are in the view to achieve concurrency control. Thus; there aresome issues that need to be solved: first; to identify what changes were made in the viewand second; to identify and solve conflicts that may arise due to changes in the databasestate during the transaction. We address both of these issues in this paper by proposing anapproach that uses our XML view update system PATAXÓ.,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2006,1
The successful grad student,Mirella M Moro; Vanessa P Braganholo; Andre C Nacul; Miguel R Fornari,This article is a collection of tips and an overview of the process through which all graduatestudents pass during their journey. Before starting a graduate program; it is important torealize that this is a long-term investment in career. Once the students are in graduateschool; it is necessary to structure their personal life to fit the demands of the program. Agraduate program starts by the choice of the advisor during the first year. Sometimes this isdone even before the student is accepted into the program. During the program; interactionwith the colleagues and professors is necessary. Getting to know them is essential to theprogram and to the life. Reading may not be enough. Read; analyze; criticize; discuss;implement. During reading note making is good. A good practice is to have a printed copy ofthe paper and annotate the thoughts and observations on it.

A comparison of Free Software Web Portals♦,Vanessa P Braganholo; Marta Mattoso,Abstract. One of the requirements for a given software system to be considered FreeSoftware is to make its source code widely available to the user community. An efficient wayof doing so is by hosting the system into a web portal. There are several portals that addressthis issue; offering free hosting to free software (and/or open source) projects. In this paper;we analyze some of the existing portals and evaluate them according to a set of priorestablished items. The goal of this analysis is to help users to choose the portal that best fitshis projects' needs.,6th International Workshop on Free Software,2005,1

Detecting referential inconsistencies in electronic CV datasets,Ivison C Rubim; Vanessa Braganholo,Abstract One way to measure the scientific progress of a country is to evaluate thecurriculum vitae (CV) of its researchers. In Brazil; this is not different. The Lattes Platform isan information system whose primary objective is to provide a single repository to store theCV of the Brazilian researchers. This system is increasingly acquiring expressiveness as themain source of information regarding the Brazilian community of researchers; students;managers; and other actors in the national system of science; technology; and innovation.However; the integrity of this important tool for gaging the national bibliographic productionmay be affected by the effect of ambiguities or referential inconsistencies in coauthoringcitations. A first step towards solving this problem lies in identifying such inconsistencies. Forthat; we propose a heuristic-based approach that uses similarity search to match papers …,Journal of the Brazilian Computer Society,2017,*

A Study about the Life Cycle of Code Anomalies,Wallace Ribeiro; Vanessa Braganholo; Leonardo Murta,Software projects usually follow key architectural principles; such as modularity; highcohesion; low coupling; etc. However; during software evolution; sometimes developersintroduce changes that are not compatible with these principles; called code anomalies.Some approaches aim at detecting and fixing code anomalies; but they miss a deeperdiscussion about the introduction patterns and life cycle of such code anomalies. In thispaper we analyze several projects to understand the incidence of code anomalies and theirlife cycle. In addition; we correlate code anomalies with some project characteristics andwith other code anomalies. For example; we could observe that Shotgun Surgery and GodMethod anomalies never happen together. Moreover; we observed that Shotgun Surgery;God Package; and Misplaced Class anomaly life cycles are closely correlated.,Software Components; Architectures and Reuse (SBCARS); 2016 X Brazilian Symposium on,2016,*

One observation that is often overlooked; however; is that each of theseelements is not immutable; rather they all evolve over time. As those datasets change overtime; the value of their derivative knowledge may decay; unless it is preserved by reacting tothose changes. Our broad research goal is to develop models; methods; and tools forselectively reacting to changes by balancing costs and benefits; ie through complete orpartial re-computation of some of the underlying processes.

A Similarity-based Approach to Match Elements Across Versions of XML Documents.,Fernando Campello; Bruno Pinto; Gabriel Tessarolli; Alessandreia Marta de Oliveira; Carlos Roberto Carvalho Oliveira; Márcio Tadeu Oliveira Júnior; Leonardo Murta; Vanessa Braganholo,Abstract. XML documents are often used to provide inter-system interoperability. A relatedproblem is that XML documents evolve over time; so identifying and understanding thechanges they undergo become crucial. Some diff approaches based on syntactic andsemantic analysis of the documents have been developed to address this problem. Thestrategy is to find data fragments that are identical in both versions of an XML document andmatch the corresponding elements through the use of context keys. However; depending onhow XML documents are managed; there is no guarantee that the values of these keysremain the same across versions. Thus; differently from existing approaches; this paperproposes the use of similarity to match corresponding elements across XML versions; ratherthan key equality. It also shows how this can be applied to support both syntactic and …,SBBD,2014,*

Uma alternativa para esse problema é o modelo de computação peer-to-peer (P2P)devido à possibilidade de agregar recursos computacionais de armazenamento sobdemanda. Assim; redes P2P podem ser utilizadas para formar infraestruturas de ambientescomputacionais altamente distribuídos. Como pesquisas normalmente envolvemcolaboração; cientistas podem formar redes sociais sobre redes P2P para compartilharrecursos computacionais e dados de interesse de todos. Por isso; este trabalho propõe ummodelo arquitetural para o compartilhamento de recursos computacionais dearmazenamento e hospedagem colaborativa de dados compartilhados em redes P2P …,Relatório técnico NCE,2009,*
A Collaborative Approach to Identify Innovative Features,Rafael EL Escalfoni; Denise PN Machado; Vanessa Braganholo; Marcos RS Borges,Innovation has been treated as an essential factor to the development of organizations andwealth generation. However; the inherent complexity of the process has shown a hardobstacle to the diffusion of innovation on enterprises. There is no magic formula to innovate;companies that are known to be innovative have different innovation processes. This isbecause innovation is intimately bound to the organizational culture. In this paper; wepropose a method to identify patterns that influence the innovative environment. We do thisthrough a collaborative dynamic to retrieve and analyze knowledge about innovativeexperiences.,Sistemas Colaborativos (SBSC); 2009 Simposio Brasileiro de,2009,*
SARAVÁ: data sharing for online communities in P2P,Marta Mattoso; Esther Pacitti; Patrick Valduriez; Reza Akbarinia; Vanessa Braganholo; Alexandre AB Lima,This paper describes SARAVÁ; a research project that aims at investigating new challengesin P2P data sharing for online communities. The major advantage of P2P is a completelydecentralized approach to data sharing which does not require centralized administration.Users may be in high numbers and interested in different kinds of collaboration and sharingtheir knowledge; ideas; experiences; etc. Data sources can be in high numbers; fairlyautonomous; ie locally owned and controlled; and highly heterogeneous with differentsemantics and structures. Our project deals with new; decentralized data managementtechniques that scale up while addressing the autonomy; dynamic behavior andheterogeneity of both users and data sources. In this context; we focus on two majorproblems: query processing with uncertain data and management of scientific workflows.,Colloquium of Computation: Brazil/INRIA; Cooperations; Advances and Challenges,2009,*

Um modelo de replicação com garantia de consistência em ambientes P2P com mobilidade,Vanessa Braganholo; Carlo E Oliveira; Izalmo P da Silva,In unstructured distributed P2P systems there is no logical structure to control the peerscoming and leaving the network; which can occur anytime due to mobility. Thus; dataexchange with consistence; and data availability are very important. To favor high dataavailability and to acquire performance gains in dynamic behavior environments; P2Psystems use data replication. However; current replication data models have a single failurepoint; or require complex conciliation algorithms to acquire consistency. This workintroduces a replication data model that simplifies the consistency mechanism.,Relatório Técnico NCE,2008,*

Open Source Web Portals,Vanessa P Braganholo; Bernardo Miranda; Marta Mattoso,ABSTRACT Open source software is required to be widely available to the user community.To help developers fulfill this requirement; Web portals provide a way to make open sourceprojects public so that the user community has access to their source code; can contribute totheir development; and can interact with the developer team. However; choosing a Webportal is not an easy task. There are several options available; each of them offering a set oftools and features to its users. The goal of this chapter is to analyze a set of existing Webportals (SourceForge. net; Apache; Tigris; ObjectWeb; and Savannah) in the hopes that thiswill help users to choose a hosting site for their projects.,Handbook of Research on Open Source Software: Technological; Economic; and,2007,*

These can benefit from data parallelismexploited in parallel systems to minimize execution time. Due to its complexity; robustnessand efficiency to exploit data parallelism; grid infrastructures are widely used in some e-Science areas like bioinformatics. Workflow techniques are very important to in-silicobioinformatics experiments; allowing the e-scientist to describe and enact experimentalprocess in a structured; repeatable and verifiable way. The main purpose of this paper is todescribe our experience with Tavena Workbench and PeDRo; which are part of my Gridproject.

Explorando arquiteturas multi-core para processamento eficiente de consultas em sistemas de gerência de Big Data,Frank WR da Silva; Victor T de Almeida; Vanessa Braganholo,Abstract. Big Data Management Systems usually manage each machine as one node inparallel query processing pipeline. In multi-core architectures; they leave several processorcores aside that could contribute to speed-up query processing. In this context; this paperexplores the use of all available processor cores; assessing the query processingperformance in several scenarios. In particular; we use the concept of worker nodes (whichare allocated in cores without disk access) and data nodes (which are allocated in coreswith disk access) in the same machine using the MyriaX engine as a base platform thatsupports this concept. We evaluate several cluster configurations varying the amount of dataand worker nodes to process two types of queries (self-join and triangle) in a Twitter dataset.The results show that increasing the I/O parallelism in terms of data nodes is not always …,*,*,*

And how is it different from “repeatability”;“replicability”; orany of the other r-words? There are already a number of attempts at defining and sorting outthese different notions. De Roure [1] lists 21 different r-words grouped into 6 categories;stating that reproducibility means reusing a research object with a change to somecircumstances; inputs; resources or components in order to see if the same results areachieved independent of those changes. Often these notions are context-sensitive (eg;validation vs verification have rather precise and very different meanings in differentcommunities. As an alternative approach to sort out terminological confusions; we attemptedto look at a different perspective. When trying to reproduce a study; what are the things thatare kept the same (eg; the overall method or algorithm) and what is changed (eg; the …,Reproducibility of Data-Oriented Experiments in e-Science,*,*

Uma Estratégia para Versionamento dos Dados de Workflows Científicos Executados em Nuvem,Fabrício Nogueira; Kary Ocaña; Vítor Silva; Vanessa Braganholo; Daniel de Oliveira,Abstract. Scientific experiments usually run hundreds or thousands of times; generating ahuge amount of data that requires to be managed. Analyzing and comparing the results ofsuch experiments is an extremely complex task. This becomes even more complex forworkflows running in the cloud because the data is scattered across multiple virtualmachines. In order to alleviate this problem; previous work proposed the use of a versioncontrol system to manage the data consumed and generated by scientific experiments.However; they add considerable overhead to the experiment; increasing the processing timeand the use of disk space. In this article; we propose an alternative strategy to reduce timeand space. Our initial experiments show that the time overhead of our approach is still high;but disk overhead was 5 times smaller than the approaches in the literature.,*,*,*
Comparing Provenance Data Models for Scientific Workflows: an Analysis of PROV-Wf and ProvOne,Wellington Oliveira; Paolo Missier; Daniel de Oliveira; Vanessa Braganholo,Abstract. Scientific workflows rely on provenance to be understandable; reproducible andtrustworthy. Nowadays; there is a growing demand for interoperability between provenancedata generated from heterogeneous workflow management systems. To address this issue;some provenance models have been proposed by extending PROV to support specificrequirements of scientific workflows. In this paper; we present two prominent provenancemodels for scientific workflows; PROV-Wf and ProvOne; which are specializations of PROV;and compare their elements and relationships. Our goal is to provide an overview of eachone and to support the choice for the most suitable for a specific context.,*,*,*
