On evaluating schema matching and mapping,Zohra Bellahsene; Angela Bonifati; Fabien Duchateau; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract The increasing demand of matching and mapping tasks in modern integrationscenarios has led to a plethora of tools for facilitating these tasks. While the plethora madethese tools available to a broader audience; it led to some form of confusion regarding theexact nature; goals; core functionalities; expected features; and basic capabilities of thesetools. Above all; it made performance measurements of these systems and their distinction adifficult task. The need for design and development of comparison standards that will allowthe evaluation of these tools is becoming apparent. These standards are particularlyimportant to mapping and matching system users; since they allow them to evaluate therelative merits of the systems and take the right business decisions. They are also importantto mapping system developers; since they offer a way of comparing the system against …,*,2011,336
Porsche: Performance oriented schema mediation,Khalid Saleem; Zohra Bellahsene; Ela Hunt,Abstract Semantic matching of schemas in heterogeneous data sharing systems is timeconsuming and error prone. Existing mapping tools employ semi-automatic techniques formapping two schemas at a time. In a large-scale scenario; where data sharing involves alarge number of data sources; such techniques are not suitable. We present a new robustautomatic method which discovers semantic schema matches in a large set of XMLschemas; incrementally creates an integrated schema encompassing all schema trees; anddefines mappings from the contributing schemas to the integrated schema. Our method;PORSCHE (Performance ORiented SCHEma mediation); utilises a holistic approach whichfirst clusters the nodes based on linguistic label similarity. Then it applies a tree miningtechnique using node ranks calculated during depth-first traversal. This minimises the …,Information Systems,2008,89
Schema evolution in data warehouses,Zohra Bellahsene,Abstract. In this paper; we address the issues related to the evolution and maintenance ofdata warehousing systems; when underlying data sources change their schema capabilities.These changes can invalidate views at the data warehousing system. We present anapproach for dynamically adapting views according to schema changes arising on sourcerelations. This type of maintenance concerns both the schema and the data of the datawarehouse. The main issue is to avoid the view recomputation from scratch especially whenviews are defined from multiple sources. The data of the data warehouse is used primarily inorganizational decision-making and may be strategic. Therefore; the schema of the datawarehouse can evolve for modeling new requirements resulting from analysis or data-mining processing. Our approach provides means to support schema evolution of the …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2002,85

A survey of view selection methods,Imene Mami; Zohra Bellahsene,Abstract Materialized view selection is a critical problem in many applications such as queryprocessing; data warehousing; distributed and semantic web databases; etc. We refer to theproblem of selecting an appropriate set of materialized views as the view selection problem.Many different view selection methods have been proposed in the literature to address thisissue. The present paper provides a survey of view selection methods. It defines aframework for highlighting the view selection problem by identifying the main dimensionsthat are the basis in the classification of view selection methods. Based on this classification;this study reviews most of the view selection methods by identifying respective potentialsand limits.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2012,72

A flexible approach for planning schema matching algorithms,Fabien Duchateau; Zohra Bellahsene; Remi Coletta,Abstract Most of the schema matching tools are assembled from multiple match algorithms;each employing a particular technique to improve matching accuracy and making matchingsystems extensible and customizable to a particular domain. The solutions provided bycurrent schema matching tools consist in aggregating the results obtained by several matchalgorithms to improve the quality of the discovered matches. However; aggregation entailsseveral drawbacks. Recently; it has been pointed out that the main issue is how to select themost suitable match algorithms to execute for a given domain and how to adjust the multipleknobs (eg threshold; performance; quality; etc.). In this article; we present a novel method forselecting the most appropriate schema matching algorithms. The matching engine makesuse of a decision tree to combine the most appropriate match algorithms.

Selection of materialized views: A cost-based approach,Xavier Baril; Zohra Bellahsene,Abstract Recently; multi-query optimization techniques have been considered as beneficialin view selection setting. The main interest of such techniques relies in detecting commonsub expressions between the different queries of workload. This feature can be exploited forsharing updates and space storage. However; due to the reuse a query change may entailan important reorganization of the multi query graph. In this paper; we present an approachthat is based on multi-query optimization for view selection and that attempts to reduce thedrawbacks resulting from these techniques. Finally; we present a performance study usingworkloads consisting of queries over the schema of the TPC-H benchmark. This study showsthat our view selection provides significant benefits over the other approaches.,International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering,2003,46
Designing and managing an XML warehouse,Xavier Baril; Zohra Bellahsène,Data present on the Web is unstructured; or has incomplete; irregular; or frequently changedstructure. XML is becoming the universal data exchange model on the Web. It has beenshown that XML is well suited for representing semi-structured data. Compared to HTML;XML provides explicit data structuring; and data presentation is separated from data content.The aim of this chapter is to present a method for designing and managing an XMLwarehouse. We have designed and implemented a browser to graphically define XML viewsin order to simplify and improve the specification of XML views. Furthermore; we also haveproposed a strategy for storing XML data in a relational DBMS.,XML Data Management: Native XML and XML-enabled Database Systems; Addison Wesley,2003,45
A context-based measure for discovering approximate semantic matching between schema elements,Fabien Duchateau; Zohra Bellahsene; Mathieu Roche,The possibility to query heterogeneous and semantically linked data sources depends onthe ability to find correspondences between their structure and/or their content.Unfortunately; most of the tools used nowadays to discover those mappings are eithermanual or semi-automatic. In this article we present an automatic method to calculate thesimilarity measure between two schema elements. Furthermore; a tool has beenimplemented; Approxivect; based on the approximation of terminological methods and onthe cosine measure between context vectors. Another important feature of our tool is that ourmethod does not use any dictionary or language-based knowledge and works in specializeddomain areas. Finally; we have performed experiments showing that our tool provides goodresults regarding those provided by COMA++. More precisely; it appears that Approxivect …,*,2006,37

Yam: a schema matcher factory,Fabien Duchateau; Remi Coletta; Zohra Bellahsene; Renée J Miller,Abstract In this paper; we present YAM; a schema matcher factory. YAM (Yet AnotherMatcher) is not (yet) another schema matching system as it enables the generation of a lacarte schema matchers according to user requirements. These requirements include apreference for recall or precision; a training data set (schemas already matched) andprovided expert correspondences. YAM uses a knowledge base that includes a (possiblylarge) set of similarity measures and classifiers. Based on the user requirements; YAMlearns how to best apply these tools (similarity measures and classifiers) in concert toachieve the best matching quality. In our demonstration; we will let users apply YAM to buildthe best schema matcher for different user requirements.,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,32
Opening the black box of ontology matching,DuyHoa Ngo; Zohra Bellahsene; Konstantin Todorov,Abstract Due to the high heterogeneity of ontologies; a combination of many methods isnecessary in order to discover correctly the semantic correspondences between theirelements. An ontology matching tool can be seen as a collection of several matchingcomponents; each implementing a specific method dealing with a specific heterogeneitytype (terminological; structural or semantic). In addition; a mapping selection module isintroduced to filter out the most likely mapping candidates. This paper proposes an empiricalstudy of the interaction between these components working together inside an ontologymatching system. By the help of datasets from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative;we have carried out several experimental studies. In the first place; we have been interestedin the impact of the mapping selection module on the performance of terminological and …,Extended Semantic Web Conference,2013,29
Querying distributed data in a super-peer based architecture,Zohra Bellahsene; Mark Roantree,Abstract Data integration is a significant challenge: relevant data objects are split acrossmultiple information sources; and often owned by different organizations. The sourcesrepresent; maintain; and export the information using a variety of formats; interfaces andsemantics. This paper addresses the issue of querying distributed data in a large scalecontext. We present a p2p information mediation framework based on the notion of super-peers; providing a super-peer network. This makes it possible for a super-peer to reachevery other peer (data source) in the system; thus realizing the concept of a integratedschema formed from all possible information sources. This is achieved by classifying datasources into domains and creating user profiles for query optimization purposes.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2004,29
View adaptation in data warehousing systems,Zohra Bellahsene,Abstract An important aspect of a data warehouse system should be its ability to evolveaccording the user and organization needs. The reason being that the schema of a datawarehouse can evolve for integrating new requirements resulting from analysis or datamining processing; schema changes on information sources etc. More precisely; schemachanges arising on information sources should be propagated to the related views in orderto maintain consistency between the sources and the derived views. In this paper; wepresent a view model extending the relational view model. And we show how this extendedview definition language allows to support view schema changes enforcing consistency andwithout causing disruptions or modifications to existing views and application programs.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,1998,29
Public data integration with websmatch,Remi Coletta; Emmanuel Castanier; Patrick Valduriez; Christian Frisch; Duyhoa Ngo; Zohra Bellahsene,Abstract Integrating open data sources can yield high value information but raises majorproblems in terms of metadata extraction; data source integration and visualization ofintegrated data. In this paper; we describe WebSmatch; a flexible environment for Web dataintegration; based on a real; end-to-end data integration scenario over public data from DataPublica. WebSmatch supports the full process of importing; refining and integrating datasources and uses third party tools for high quality visualization. We use a typical scenario ofpublic data integration which involves problems not solved by currents tools: poorlystructured input data sources (XLS files) and rich visualization of integrated data.,Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Open Data,2012,28

Where's Charlie: family based heuristics for peer-to-peer schema integration,John Tranier; Renaud Baraer; Zohra Bellahsene; Maguelonne Teisseire,Querying semantically related data sources depends on the ability to map between theirschemas. Unfortunately; in most cases matching between schemas is still largely performedmanually. As a consequence; semantic integration issues have become a key bottleneck inthe deployment of a large scale integration systems (the number of schemas to map ishuge). This work deals with automated methods for matching and efficiently generatingschema mappings in large scale environments. We propose a level-wise algorithm basedon a semantic distance to evaluate similarity between schema nodes. However; in a largescale context; computing the semantic distance for every couple of nodes cannot be done.Thus; we proposed family based heuristics (CHARLIE) in order to efficiently generatemappings. Experiments have shown that our approach is very efficient for large scale …,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2004. IDEAS'04. Proceedings. International,2004,24

In thispaper; we present a system YAM++; which supports self-configuration; flexibility andextensibility in combining individual matchers. Additionally; it is more human-centeredapproach since it allows users to express their preference between precision and recall.

Measuring the quality of an integrated schema,Fabien Duchateau; Zohra Bellahsene,Abstract Schema integration is a central task for data integration. Over the years; many toolshave been developed to discover correspondences between schemas elements. Some ofthem produce an integrated schema. However; the schema matching community lacks somemetrics which evaluate the quality of an integrated schema. Two measures have beenproposed; completeness and minimality. In this paper; we extend these metrics for an expertintegrated schema. Then; we complete them by another metric that evaluates thestructurality of an integrated schema. These three metrics are finally aggregated to evaluatethe proximity between two schemas. These metrics have been implemented as part of abenchmark for evaluating schema matching tools. We finally report experiments resultsusing these metrics over 8 datasets with the most popular schema matching tools which …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2010,21
Yam++-a combination of graph matching and machine learning approach to ontology alignment task,DuyHoa Ngo; Zohra Bellahsene; R Coletta,Abstract Ontology matching is a key solution to the semantic heterogeneity problem. Itdiscovers semantic correspondences between related entities of different ontologies toenable interoperability. The fundamental challenging issues; that all automated ontologymatching systems have to deal with; are matcher selection; combination and tuning [18; 46].In this paper; we describe our approach named YAM++ by solving these issues in each ofYAM++'s component; ie; element matcher; structure matcher; combination and selection. Inparticular; in the element matcher; we propose a machine learning based method toautomatically combine different terminological similarity metrics. In the structure matcher; wepropose a similarity propagation method to deal with structural heterogeneity of ontologies.In the combination and selection component; we propose a dynamic weighted sum …,Journal of Web Semantics,2012,19
View mechanism for schema evolution in object-oriented dbms,Zohra Bellahsene,Abstract This paper discusses the topic of using view mechanism to simulate schemamodifications without database reorganisation in Object Oriented Database Systems. Ourapproach allows each user to specify the schema modifications to his own virtual schemarather than to the base schema shared by many users. One of the main advantagesprovided by this approach is the preservation of the independence of existing applicationprograms from the schema evolution. The most important issue concerns the control andsharing of the information introduced by capacity-augmenting views. Furthermore; capacityaugmenting schema modifications cannot be unambiguously propagated to the baseschema when the related virtual class is derived from several classes.

Modeling view selection as a constraint satisfaction problem,Imene Mami; Remi Coletta; Zohra Bellahsene,Abstract Using materialized views can highly speed up the query processing time. Thispaper deals with the view selection issue; which consists in finding a set of views tomaterialize that minimizes the expected cost of evaluating the query workload; given alimited amount of resource such as total view maintenance cost and/or storage space.However; the solution space is huge since it entails a large number of possiblecombinations of views. For this matter; we have designed a solution involving constraintprogramming; which has proven to be a powerful approach for modeling and solvingcombinatorial problems. The efficiency of our method is evaluated using workloadsconsisting of queries over the schema of the TPC-H benchmark.

However; their quality results often decrease when onerequires to integrate a new similarity measure or when matching particular domain schemas.This paper describes YAM (Yet Another Matcher); which is a schema matcher factory.Indeed; it enables the generation of a dedicated matcher for a given schema matchingscenario; according to user inputs.

Overview of YAM++—(not) Yet Another Matcher for ontology alignment task,DuyHoa Ngo; Zohra Bellahsene,Abstract Several challenges to the field of ontology matching have been outlined in recentresearch. The selection of the appropriate similarity measures as well as the configurationtuning of their combination are known as fundamental issues the community should dealwith. Verifying the semantic coherence of the discovered alignment is also known as acrucial task. As the challenging issues are both in basic matching techniques and in theircombination; our approach is aimed to provide improvement at the basic matcher level andalso at the level of framework. Matching large scale ontologies is currently one of the mostchallenging issues in ontology matching field. The main reason is that large ontologies arehighly heterogeneous both at terminological and conceptual levels. Furthermore; matchingvery large ontologies entails exploring a very large searching space to discover …,Web Semantics: Science; Services and Agents on the World Wide Web,2016,15
An extended preorder index for optimising XPath expressions,Martin F O’connor; Zohra Bellahsène; Mark Roantree,Abstract Many of the problems with native XML databases relate to query performance andsubsequently; it can be difficult to convince traditional database users of the benefits of usingsemi-or unstructured databases. Presently; there still lacks an index structure providingefficient support for structural queries and the traditional data-centric and content queries.This paper presents an extended index structure based on the preorder traversal rank andthe level (or depth) rank of each node in a document tree. The extended index fully supportsthe navigation of all XPath axes while efficiently supporting data-centric queries. The abilityto start path traversals from arbitrary nodes in a document tree also enables the extendedindex to support the evaluation of path traversals embedded in XQuery expressions.Furthermore; an encoding technique is presented where properties of the level ranking …,International XML Database Symposium,2005,15
Designing a benchmark for the assessment of schema matching tools,Fabien Duchateau; Zohra Bellahsene,Over the years; many schema matching approaches have been developed to discovercorrespondences between schemas. Although this task is crucial in data integration; itsevaluation; both in terms of matching quality and time performance; is still manuallyperformed. Indeed; there is no common platform which gathers a collection of schemamatching datasets to fulfil this goal. Another problem deals with the measuring of the post-match effort; a human cost that schema matching approaches aim at reducing.Consequently; we propose XBenchMatch; a schema matching benchmark with availabledatasets and new measures to evaluate this manual post-match effort and the quality ofintegrated schemas.

A crucial stepduring this integration process is the discovery of correspondences between the datasources; and the evaluation of their quality. For this purpose; the overall metric has beendesigned to compute the post-match effort; but it suffers from major drawbacks. Thus; wepresent in this paper two related metrics to compute this effort. The former is called post-match effort; ie; the amount of work that the user must provide to correct thecorrespondences that have been discovered by the tool. The latter enables themeasurement of human-spared resources; ie; the rate of automation that has been …,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2011,14

An active meta-model for knowledge evolution in an object-oriented database,Zohra Bellahsene,Abstract It is not reasonable to consider that a single data model can be adequate for anyapplication. There are many data models; each of them has its advantages and drawbacks.Building up an other model does not make sense in the actual slate of research in thedatabase field. Our approach consists of a proposal of a meta-model providing an openenvironment to allow knowledge evolution in object-oriented database systems. Knowledgeevolution means updates on database schema: propagation of updates from schema toinstances and dynamic propagation of views update operations. Furthermore this meta-model enables the extension of data model concepts by modifying their semantics. Bymodifying and extending these model; it can be tailored or customised to suit variousapplication domains.,International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering,1993,13
Light-weight cross-lingual ontology matching with LYAM++,Abdel Nasser Tigrine; Zohra Bellahsene; Konstantin Todorov,Abstract During the last decade; several automatic ontology matching systems weredeveloped to address the problem of ontology heterogeneity. Aligning cross-lingualontologies is among the current challenging issues in the field of ontology matching. Themajority of the existing approaches rely on machine translation to deal with this problem.However; inherent problems of machine translation are imprecision and ambiguity.

Inthis paper; we present a view model for XML based on XML-QL. Views over semistructureddata filter data of interest for applications. Furthermore; they provide structure tosemistructured data that can be exploited by the query optimiser. A XML view is defined by aquery on XML document (s) and returns a XML document that can be handled by any XMLbrowser. In our approach; a DTD validating the view result is generated. Moreover; our viewspecification language takes into account distribution. Indeed; with our view definition; theuser can express which data should be transmitted and materialised.,*,2001,12
Extending a view mechanism to support schema evolution in federated database systems,Zohra Bellahsene,Abstract This paper discusses the impact of autonomy requirement on schema design intightly coupled federated database systems. In a federated database system; an importantfeature of a schema evolution strategy should be how the conceptual autonomy can bepreserved. The conceptual autonomy requirement states that evolution of a local schemashould not affect the remote schemms. In this paper we propose a view mechanismenhanced with import/export facilities to support schema evolution enforcing the autonomyrequirement. More precisely; some schema evolution operations having ability to entailincompatibility of existing programs with regard to the new schema will not actuallyperformed but simulated by creating specific views.

Tuning for schema matching,Zohra Bellahsene; Fabien Duchateau,Abstract Schema matching has long been heading towards complete automation. However;the difficulty arising from heterogeneity in the data sources; domain specificity or structurecomplexity has led to a plethora of semi-automatic matching tools. Besides; letting users thepossibility to tune a tool also provides more flexibility; for instance to increase the matchingquality. In the recent years; much work has been carried out to support users in the tuningprocess; specifically at higher levels. Indeed; tuning occurs at every step of the matchingprocess. At the lowest level; similarity measures include internal parameters which directlyimpact computed similarity values. Furthermore; a common filter to present mappings tousers are the thresholds applied to these values. At a mid-level; users can adopt one ormore strategies according to the matching tool that they use. These strategies aim at …,*,2011,11
Improving quality and performance of schema matching in large scale,Fabien Duchateau; Mathieu Roche; Zohra Bellahsene,Schema matching is a crucial task to gather information of the same domain. However; thisprocess is still largely performed manually or semi-automatically; discouraging thedeployment of large-scale mediation systems. Indeed; these large-scale scenarii need asolution which ensures both an acceptable matching quality and good performance. In thisarticle; we present the BMatch approach to efficiently match a large number of schemas. Thequality aspect is based on the combination of terminological and contextual methods. Theperformance aspect relies on a B-tree indexing structure to reduce the search space. Finally;experiments with real sets of schemas show that our approach is scalable and outperformsthe most referenced matching tools both in quality of matches and performance time.,Revue des Sciences et Technologies de l'Information-Série ISI: Ingénierie des Systèmes d'Information,2008,11

BMatch: a Semantically Context-based Tool Enhanced by an Indexing Structure to Accelerate Schema Matching.,Fabien Duchateau; Zohra Bellahsene; Mathieu Roche,Abstract Schema matching is a crucial task to gather information of the same domain. This ismore true on the web; where a large number of data sources are available and require to bematched. However; the schema matching process is still largely performed manually or semi-automatically; discouraging the deployment of large-scale mediation systems. Indeed; theselarge-scale scenarii need a solution which ensures both an acceptable matching quality andgood performance. In this article; we present an approach to match efficiently a largenumber of schemas. The quality aspect is based on the combination of terminologicalmethods and cosine measure between context vectors. The performance aspect re-,BDA,2007,10
View adaptation in the fragment-based approach,Zohra Bellahsene,View adaptation relies on adapting a set of materialized views in response to schemachanges of source relations and/or after view redefinition. Recently; several view selectionmethods that are based on materializing fragments of the view rather than the whole viewhave been proposed. We call this approach the fragment-based approach. This paperpresents a view adaptation method in the fragment-based approach; which is aimed atexploiting the opportunities to share not only materialized data; but also computationbetween the different views. In order to do this; the views are modeled using the so-calledmultiview materialization graph; which represents the views as a bipartite directed acyclicgraph whose nodes are operations and fragments of the views. Then; the adaptation isperformed regarding all materialized views and not solely the old materialization of the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,9
Updates and object-generating views in ODBS,Zohra Bellahsene,Abstract In object-oriented database systems; a view mechanism can extend the objectparadigm by adapting object structure and object behavior to the needs of the differentapplications or users. In this paper we consider views with object-generating semanticswhich is an important construct in database environment and mediator systems (Y.Papakonstantinou; S. Abiteboul; H. Garcia-Molina; Object Fusion in Mediator Systems; in:Proceedings of the International Conference on Very Large DataBases; New York; July1998). We reexamine the problem of updating views according to the aspects of object-orientation; namely: object identity; inheritance and aggregation path. Furthermore; wepropose a taxonomy of virtual classes in order to define the update semantics with respect tothe virtual class semantics. We present also a cost model for our update algorithms to …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2000,9
Materializing a set of views: Dynamic strategies and performance evaluation,Zohra Bellahsene; Philippe Marot,The present paper focuses on a view selection method exploiting a central construct calledMulti View Materialization Graph (MVMG) which provides a framework to supportmaterialized; virtual and hybrid fragments of views. Furthermore; our approach is dynamic; iematerialized fragments can become virtual and vice versa. In the same way; attributes maychange their status according to their update and their query frequencies. Finally; ourapproach can be applied in both data warehouse and mediator systems.,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2000 International,2000,9
Automatic extraction of structurally coherent mini-taxonomies,Khalid Saleem; Zohra Bellahsene,Abstract Today; ontologies are being used to model a domain of knowledge in semanticweb. OWL is considered to be the main language for developing such ontologies. It is basedon the XML model; which inherently follows the hierarchical structure. In this paper wedemonstrate an automatic approach for emergent semantics modeling of ontologies. Wefollow the collaborative ontology construction method without the direct interaction of domainusers; engineers or developers. A very important characteristic of an ontology is itshierarchical structure of concepts. We consider large sets of domain specific hierarchicalstructures as trees and apply frequent sub-tree mining for extracting common hierarchicalpatterns. Our experiments show that these hierarchical patterns are good enough torepresent and describe the concepts for the domain ontology. The technique further …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2008,8

Dataset recommendation for data linking: an intensional approach,Mohamed Ben Ellefi; Zohra Bellahsene; Stefan Dietze; Konstantin Todorov,Abstract With the growing quantity and diversity of publicly available web datasets; mostnotably Linked Open Data; recommending datasets; which meet specific criteria; hasbecome an increasingly important; yet challenging problem. This task is of particular interestwhen addressing issues such as entity retrieval; semantic search and data linking. Here; wefocus on that last issue. We introduce a dataset recommendation approach to identify linkingcandidates based on the presence of schema overlap between datasets. While anunderstanding of the nature of the content of specific datasets is a crucial prerequisite; weadopt the notion of dataset profiles; where a dataset is characterized through a set ofschema concept labels that best describe it and can be potentially enriched by retrievingtheir textual descriptions.

A schemaguide for accelerating the view adaptation process,Jun Liu; Mark Roantree; Zohra Bellahsene,Abstract Materialization of XML views significantly improves query performance in the oftenslow execution times for XPath expressions. Existing efforts focus on providing approachesof how to reuse materialized view for answering XPath queries and; the problem ofsynchronizing materialized data in response to the changes taking place at data sourcelevel. In this paper; we study a closely related problem; the view adaptation problem; whichmaintains the materialized data incrementally after view definitions have beenredefined/changed (view redefinition). Our research focuses on an efficient process for viewadaptation upon the fragment-based view representation by segmenting materialized datainto fragments and developing algorithms to update only those materialized fragments thathave affected by the view definition changes. This serves to minimize the effect of view …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2010,7
Rdf dataset profiling-a survey of features; methods; vocabularies and applications,Mohamed Ben Ellefi; Zohra Bellahsene; J Breslin; Elena Demidova; Stefan Dietze; Julian Szymanski; Konstantin Todorov,Abstract. The Web of Data; and in particular Linked Data; has seen tremendous growth overthe past years. However; reuse and take-up of these rich data sources is often limited andfocused on a few well-known and established RDF datasets. This can be partially attributedto the lack of reliable and up-to-date information about the characteristics of availabledatasets. While RDF datasets vary heavily with respect to the features related to quality;provenance; interlinking; licenses; statistics and dynamics; reliable information about suchfeatures is essential to enable dataset discovery and selection in tasks such as entity linking;distributed query; search or question answering. Even though there exists a wealth of workscontributing to the task of dataset profiling in general; these works are spread across a widerange of communities. In this survey; we provide a first comprehensive overview of the …,Semantic Web,2017,6
Extended tversky similarity for resolving terminological heterogeneities across ontologies,DuyHoa Ngo; Zohra Bellahsene; Konstantin Todorov,Abstract We propose a novel method to compute similarity between cross-ontology conceptsbased on the amount of overlap of the information content of their labels. We extendTversky's similarity measure by using the information content of each term within an ontologylabel both for the similarity computation and for the weight assignment to tokens. Theapproach is suitable for handling compound labels. Our experiments showed that itoutperforms existing terminological similarity measures for the ontology matching task.,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2013,6
iXPeer: Implementing layers of abstraction in P2P Schema Mapping using AutoMed,Zohra Bellahsene; Charalambos Lazanitis; Peter Mc Brien; Nikos Rizopoulos,ABSTRACT The task of model based data integration becomes more complicated when thedata sources to be integrated are distributed; heterogeneous; and high in number. Onerecent solution to the issues of distribution and scale is to perform data integration usingpeer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Current P2P data integration architectures have mostly beenflat; only specifying mappings directly between peers. Some do form the schemas intohierarchies; but none provide any abstraction of the schemas. This paper describes a set ofgeneral purpose P2P meta-data and data exchange primitives provided by an extendedversion of the AutoMed toolkit; and uses the primitives to implement a new architecturecalled iXPeer. iXPeer deals with integration on several levels of abstraction; where the lowerlevels define precise mappings between data source schemas; but the higher levels are …,IWI’2): 2nd Workshop on Innovations in Web Infrastructure; Edinburgh; UK,2006,6

Views for information system design without reorganization,Zohra Bellahsene; Pascal Poncelet; Maguelonne Teisseire,Abstract In this paper; we propose an approach for managing structural evolutions throughviews. Evolutions are not actually performed but simulated; thus the database schema ispreserved for both users and existing applications. Furthermore; the approach avoids costlydatabase reorganizations. This results from the multi-schema architecture which isintroduced and from the isolated management of additional data. In our approach; theconcept of virtual class is complemented through the notion of virtual schema;encompassing several classes and their possible inheritance or derivation relationships withtheir own properties. The inter-view visibility is enhanced with the main advantage ofimproving view re-use.,International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering,1996,6

In pastresearch; the view selection issue has essentially been investigated in the centralizedcontext. In this paper; we address the view selection problem in a distributed scenario. Wefirst extend the AND-OR view graph to capture the distributed features. Then; we propose asolution using constraint programming for modeling and solving the view selection problemunder multiple resource constraints in a distributed context.

Complex schema match discovery and validation through collaboration,Khalid Saleem; Zohra Bellahsene,Abstract In this paper; we demonstrate an approach for the discovery and validation of n: mschema match in the hierarchical structures like the XML schemata. Basic idea is to proposean n: m node match between children (leaf nodes) of two matching non-leaf nodes of the twoschemata. The similarity computation of the two non-leaf nodes is based upon the syntacticand linguistic similarity of the node labels supported by the similarity among the ancestralpaths from nodes to the root. The n: m matching proposition is then validated with the help ofthe mini-taxonomies: hierarchical structures extracted from a large set of schema treesbelonging to the same domain. The technique intuitively supports the collective intelligenceof the domain users; indirectly collaborating for the validation of the complex matchpropositions.,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2009,5

A declarative approach to view selection modeling,Imene Mami; Zohra Bellahsene; Remi Coletta,Abstract View selection is important in many data-intensive systems eg; commercialdatabase and data warehousing systems. Given a database (or a data warehouse) schemaand a query workload; view selection is to choose an appropriate set of views to bematerialized that optimizes the total query cost; given a limited amount of resource; eg;storage space and total view maintenance cost. The view selection problem is known to be aNP-complete problem. In this paper; we propose a declarative approach that involves aconstraint programming technique which is known to be efficient for the resolution of NP-complete problems. The originality of our approach is that it provides a clear separationbetween formulation and resolution of the problem. For this purpose; the view selectionproblem is modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem in an easy and declarative way …,*,2013,4

It iswell known from the literature that a crucial point that hampers the development and wideadoption of mediation systems lies in the high entry and maintenance costs of such systems.To overcome these barriers; the FORUM project investigates three main research issues:(i)automatic discovery of semantic correspondences (ii) consistency maintenance ofmappings; and (iii) tolerant rewriting of queries in the presence of approximate mappings.,ACM Sigmod Record,2010,4

Selection and combination of heterogeneous mappings to enhance biomedical ontology matching,Amina Annane; Zohra Bellahsene; Faiçal Azouaou; Clement Jonquet,Abstract This paper presents a novel background knowledge approach which selects andcombines existing mappings from a given biomedical ontology repository to improveontology alignment. Current background knowledge approaches usually select eithermanually or automatically a limited number of different ontologies and use them as a wholefor background knowledge. Whereas in our approach; we propose to pick up only relevantconcepts and relevant existing mappings linking these concepts all together in a specificand customized background knowledge graph. Paths within this graph will help to discovernew mappings. We have implemented and evaluated our approach using the content of theNCBO BioPortal repository and the Anatomy benchmark from the Ontology AlignmentEvaluation Initiative. We used the mapping gain measure to assess how much our final …,European Knowledge Acquisition Workshop,2016,3
YAM: A Step Forward for Generating a Dedicated Schema Matcher,Fabien Duchateau; Zohra Bellahsene,Abstract Discovering correspondences between schema elements is a crucial task for dataintegration. Most schema matching tools are semi-automatic; eg; an expert must tune certainparameters (thresholds; weights; etc.). They mainly use aggregation methods to combinesimilarity measures. The tuning of a matcher; especially for its aggregation function; has astrong impact on the matching quality of the resulting correspondences; and makes it difficultto integrate a new similarity measure or to match specific domain schemas. In this paper; wepresent YAM (Yet Another Matcher); a matcher factory which enables the generation of adedicated schema matcher for a given schema matching scenario. For this purpose we haveformulated the schema matching task as a classification problem. Based on this machinelearning framework; YAM automatically selects and tunes the best method to combine …,*,2016,3

Optimizing XML data with view fragments,Jun Liu; Mark Roantree; Zohra Bellahsene,Abstract As web-based applications and data continue to grow; large caches of XML datawill result in many application domains. In sensor web applications; there are continuousstreams of sensor data being generated; converted to XML and stored for domain queriesand data mining purposes. The main problem with these XML caches is that existing XMLdatabase queries are very slow; especially for large databases or those with complexstructures. In this work we propose a view-based system to XML optimization where the mostpopular or well-chosen queries are materialized and fragmented to greatly improve theperformance of all XML queries.,Proceedings of the Twenty-First Australasian Conference on Database Technologies-Volume 104,2010,3
Porsche: Performance oriented schema matching,Khalid Saleem; Zohra Bellahsene; Ela Hunt,ABSTRACT Semantic matching of schemas in heterogeneous data sharing systems is timeconsuming and error prone. Existing mapping tools employ semi-automatic techniques formapping two schemas at a time. In a large-scale scenario; where data sharing involves alarge number of data sources; such techniques are not suitable. In this paper we present amethod; which creates a mediated schema tree from a large set of input schema trees anddefines mappings from the contributing schemas to the mediated schema. It is a two-phaseapproach. First; we use a set of linguistic matchers; which extract the semantics of all distinctnode labels; present in input schemas; and form clusters of semantically similar labels.Second; we use a tree-mining data structure; combined with the similar label clusters; tocalculate the context of each node; which is used in mapping.

A Flexible Approach Based on the user Preferences for Schema Matching.,Wided Guédria; Zohra Bellahsene; Mathieu Roche,Abstract—Automating schema matching is challenging. Previ-ous approaches focus oncomputing all element matches between two schemas and don't take into account thepreferences of the user who can be only interested in specific elements of the schema. Wepropose a new approach based on the user preferences to extract subsets of schemas onwhich will be applied the matching process. Fuzzy sets can be used to express the userpreferences in the selection criteria of a query. Thus; we introduce the notion of fuzzy setdefined over a part of the schema; then its extended form that is explicitly defined over thewhole schema; according to the generalization rules. This will reduce the research spaceand therefore contribute to optimize the schema matching process. We also propose topropagate weights to elements of a target schema according to the user preferences on a …,RCIS,2007,3

Incremental method for XML view maintenance in case of non monitored data sources,Xavier Baril; Zohra Bellahsène,Abstract In this paper; we are dealing with the topic of view maintenance which consists ofmaintaining materialized views in response to data modifications on the data sources. Wepropose an incremental method to maintain XML views. This is achieved by defining firsthow to store XML views; which may be obtained over different data sources; in a relationalDBMS. The identifiers used to store the view definition (in particular mapping patterns;unions and joins) allow the definition of the incremental method in the sense that thematerialization of the view does not require re-computing all stored data to maintain XMLviews.,International Conference on Current Trends in Theory and Practice of Computer Science,2006,3

Adapting materialized views after redefinition in distributed environments,Zohra Bellahsene,Abstract In this paper; we show how view adaptation can be supported in order to keepviews up to date and running after view redefinition. In particular in the area of integratedsystems such as Web sites; data warehousing systems and mediator systems; efficientsolutions to this task are of most importance. The proposed view adaptation is based on anovel view selection approach that consists in decomposing views into fragments and thenmerging them into a Multi View Materialization Graph; sharing materialized fragments wherepossible. The goal is to minimize both communication cost (ie; accessing the sources) andthe cost of adapting the view materialization. In related work; view adaptation is based solelyon the old materialization of the same view. Our approach performs view adaptationregarding all the materialized views therefore it optimizes the communication cost.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2000,3

Data integration is a significant challenge: relevant data objects are split acrossmultiple information sources; and often owned by different organizations. The sourcesrepresent; maintain; and export the information using a variety of formats; interfaces andsemantics. This paper addresses the issue of querying distributed data in a large scalecontext. We present a p2p information mediation framework based on the notion of super-peers; providing a super-peer network. This makes it possible for a super-peer to reachevery other peer (data source) in the system; thus realizing the concept of a integratedschema formed from all possible information sources.

Selecting optimal background knowledge sources for the ontology matching task,Abdel Nasser Tigrine; Zohra Bellahsene; Konstantin Todorov,Abstract It is a common practice to rely on background knowledge (BK) in order to assist andimprove the ontology matching process. The choice of an appropriate source of backgroundknowledge for a given matching task; however; remains a vastly unexplored question. In thecurrent paper; we propose an automatic BK selection approach that does not depend on aninitial direct matching; can handle multilingualism and is domain independent. Theapproach is based on the construction of an index for a set of BK candidates. The couple ofontologies to be aligned is modeled as a query with respect to the indexed BK sources andthe best candidate is selected within an information retrieval paradigm. We evaluate oursystem in a series of experiments in both general-purpose and domain-specific matchingscenarios. The results show that our approach is capable of selecting the BK that …,European Knowledge Acquisition Workshop,2016,1

Mapping selection is used at the end of the matching process in order to producethe final alignment. There are different strategies and methods for selecting mappings; thatcan be mainly classified into two categories. The first category is based on threshold filterand cardinality filter. The second category; called also semantic verification; uses semanticfilter. It takes additional semantic information of entities in the input ontologies inconsideration to select the best mappings. Verifying the semantic coherence of thediscovered mappings is known as a crucial and challenging task namely in large scaleontology matching because almost all reasoning systems fail or cannot completely classifylarge ontologies.

Designing a Benchmark for the Assessment of XML Schema Matching Tools,Fabien Duchateau; Zohra Bellahsene,Over the years; many XML schema matching systems have been developed. A benchmarkfor assessing the capabilities of schema matching systems and providing uniform conditionsand the same testbed for all schema matching prototypes; has become indispensable as thematching systems grow in complexity. However; developing a benchmark for the schemamatching problem is very challenging; given the wide range of techniques that can beapplied to assist in schema matching. In this paper; we present the foundations anddesiderata of a benchmark for XML schema matching.

A scalable approach for large-scale Schema Mediation,Khalid Saleem; Zohra Bellahsene,Abstract. Nearly all schema-matching systems compare two schemas at a time and aim forquality matching with significant human intervention. For a limited number of schemas (lessthan 10) of small size (less than 100 nodes); the matching and integration processes giveacceptable performance. The novelty of our method is fourfold. First; we support fullyautomated schema matching. Second; we generate approximate mappings and also buildan integrated schema at the same time. Third; we show that our approach is scalable tohundreds of schemas; having large size. Fourth; we utilize tree mining techniques; clusteringof similar node labels; for schema matching; which is a budding research approach.,DECOR,2007,1

Temporal Business Objects: A Waste of Time?,Paul Schleifer; Yuan Sun; Dilip Patel,Abstract It has been widely observed that temporal semantics and functionality are oftendeveloped on an ad hoc basis; and the benefits of temporal database research are rarelyrealised. The object-oriented paradigm offers many in terms of performance; semanticrichness; and re-use; these advantages can be realised as conceptual and softwarecomponents known as business objects. However; fundamental barriers to the use oftemporal database research in real business software remain. These barriers; namely theabsence of a consensus temporal object model and the lack of suitable temporal modellingtools; are addressed in this paper. Unless these issues are addressed; the development ofre-usable temporal business objects will not yield tangible benefits in commercialenvironments.,*,1998,1
Dataset profiling–a guide to features; methods; applications and vocabularies,Mohamed Ben Ellefi; Zohra Bellahsene; John G Breslin; Elena Demidova; Stefan Dietze; Julian Szymanski; Konstantin Todorov,Abstract. The Web of data; in particular Linked Data; has seen tremendous growth over thepast years. However; reuse and take-up is limited and focused on a few well-known andestablished knowledge bases. This can be attributed in parts to the lack of reliable and up-to-date information about the characteristics of available datasets. While datasets vary heavilywith respect to features related to quality; coverage; dynamics and currency; reliableinformation about such features is essential for enabling data and dataset discovery in taskssuch as entity retrieval or distributed search. Even though there exists a wealth of workscontributing to this central problem of dataset profiling; these are spread across a range ofcommunities and disciplines.

A survey on web data linking,Manel Achichi; Zohra Bellahsene; Konstantin Todorov,Data are being published continuously on the web in a decentralized manner leading to aweb of heterogeneous data. Given the large amount of published data; access to relevantinformation becomes difficult; hence the need to interconnect these data. In this paper; wepropose a survey on approaches and tools addressing the data linking problem. Theparticularity of this survey is that we consider the linking processes as a pipeline composedof pre-processing; main matching and post-processing phases and we review the differenttechniques applied on each of these three steps in service of the global linking task. Theactual task of linking two data instances is certainly at the core of this process; however;what happens before and what happens after this task is performed; is of crucial importancefor the effectiveness and the efficiency of a data linking tool.

A Constraint Optimization Method for Large-Scale Distributed View Selection,Imene Mami; Zohra Bellahsene; Remi Coletta,Abstract View materialization is a commonly used technique in many data-intensive systemsto improve the query performance. Increasing need for large-scale data processing has ledto investigating the view selection problem in distributed complex scenarios where a set ofcooperating computer nodes may share data and issue numerous queries. In our work; theview selection and data placement problem is studied given a limited amount of resourceseg storage space capacity per computer node and maximum view maintenance cost. Wealso consider the IO and CPU costs for each computer node as well as the networkbandwidth. To address this problem; we have proposed a constraint programming approachwhich is based on constraint reasoning to tackle problems that aim to satisfy a set ofconstraints.

A Declarative Approach to Modeling and Solving the View Selection Problem,Imene Mami,View selection is important in many data-intensive systems eg; commercial database anddata warehousing systems to improve query performance. View selection can be defined asthe process of selecting a set of views to be materialized in order to optimize queryevaluation. To support this process; different related issues have to be considered.Whenever a data source is changed; the materialized views built on it have to be maintainedin order to compute up-to-date query results. Besides the view maintenance issue; eachmaterialized view also requires additional storage space which must be taken into accountwhen deciding which and how many views to materialize. The problem of choosing whichviews to materialize that speed up incoming queries constrained by an additional storageoverhead and/or maintenance costs; is known as the view selection problem.

View Selection and Materialization,Zohra Bellahsene,ABSTRACT There are many motivations for investigating the view selection problem. At first;materialized views are increasingly being supported by commercial database systems andare used to speed up query response time. Therefore; the problem of choosing anappropriate set of views to materialize in the database is crucial in order to improvequeryprocessing cost. Another application of the view selection issue is selecting views tomaterialize in data warehousing systems to answer decision support queries. The problemaddressed in this paper is similar to that of deciding which views to materialize in datawarehousing. However; most existing view selection methods are static. Moreover; none ofthese methods have considered the problem of de-materializing the already materializedviews. Yet it is a very important issue since the size of storage space is usually restricted …,Data Warehousing Design and Advanced Engineering Applications: Methods for Complex Construction: Methods for Complex Construction,2009,*

Automatic Complex Schema Mapping Discovery and Validation by Structurally Coherent Frequent Mini-Taxonomies,Khalid Saleem; Zohra Bellahsene,Match cardinality aspect in schema matching is categorized as simple element levelmatching and complex structural level matching. Simple matching comprises of 1: 1; 1: n andn: 1 match cardinality; whereas n: m match cardinality is considered to be complex matching.Most of the existing approaches and tools give good 1: 1 local and global match cardinalitybut lack the capabilities for handling the complex cardinality issue. In this paper wedemonstrate an automatic approach for creation and validation of n: m schema mappings.Our technique is applicable to hierarchical structures like XML Schema. Basic idea is topropose an n: m nodes mapping between children (leaf nodes) of two matching non-leafnodes of two schemas. The similarity computation of the two non-leaf nodes is based uponthe syntactic and linguistic similarity of node labels; supported by similarity among the …,*,2008,*

However; this aggregation entails several drawbacks on the performance; qualityand tuning aspects. In this paper; we present a novel method for combining schemamatching algorithms; which enables to avoid these drawbacks. Unlike other compositematchers; it is able to learn the most appropriate match algorithms for a given schemamatching scenario. Thus; the matching engine makes use of a decision tree to combine mostappropriate match algorithms. As a first consequence of using the decision tree; theperformance of the system is improved since the complexity is bounded by the height of …,*,2008,*
BMatch: A Quality/Performance Balanced Approach for Large Scale Schema Matching,Fabien Duchateau; Mathieu Roche; Zohra Bellahsene,Schema matching is a crucial task to gather information of the same domain. This is evenmore the case when dealing with data warehouses; where a large number of data sourcesare available and require matching and integra-tion. However; the matching process is stilllargely performed manually or semi-automatically; thus discouraging the use of large scaleintegration systems. In-deed; these large scale scenarios require a solution which ensuresboth an ac-ceptable matching quality and good performance. In this article; we present anapproach to efficiently match a large number of schemas. The quality aspect is based on thecombination of terminological methods and cosine measure between context vectors. Theperformance aspect relies on a B-tree indexing structure to reduce the search space. Finally;our approach has been implemented and exper-iments with real sets of schemas show …,*,2008,*

A Context-based Measure for Discovering Approximate Semantic Matching between Schema,Fabien Duchateau; Zohra Bellahsene; Mathieu Roche,The possibility to query heterogeneous and semantically linked data sources depends onthe ability to find correspondences between their structure and/or their content.Unfortunately; most of the tools used nowadays to discover those mappings are eithermanual or semi-automatic. In this article we present an automatic method to calculate thesimilarity measure between two schema elements. Furthermore; a tool has beenimplemented; Approxivect; based on the approximation of terminological methods and onthe cosine measure between context vectors. Another important feature of our tool is that ourmethod does not use any dictionary or language-based knowledge and works in specializeddomain areas. Finally; we have performed experiments showing that our tool provides goodresults regarding those provided by the most referenced matching tools.

Toward a Knowledge model of problem solving,Zohra Bellahsene; O Massiot,Abstract The model proposed in this paper belongs to a new class of data models that arecharacterized by the ability to capture both data semantics (description of entities) andknowledge (inferential and operational capabilities). Our approach attempts to extend thecapabilities of semantic data models by incorporating features taken from the knowledgebased systems area such as inferential capabilities. Its main contribution includes amechanism that allows abstract knowledge typing by handling all concepts: heuristics;properties; relationships and constraints as objects. It also proposes an approach toreasoning process modelisation and presents concepts and mechanisms for problemsolving simulation.,*,1990,*

Rôle et techniques de l’alignement d’ontologies: un survol de l’état de l’art,Zohra Bellahsene,Résumé. Le besoin d'intégrer et d'analyser des grandes masses est présent dans denombreux domaines d'applications. Le problème de l'alignement d'ontologies/schémas dontle résultat est un ensemble de correspondances entre différentes représentations du monderéel; est au centre du processus d'intégration des données. En effet; l'intégration dedonnées est motivée par la forte hétérogénéité des données issues de sources multiples etl'absence de sémantique suffisante pour bien comprendre la signification des données.Citons le domaine biomédical où l'alignement d'ontologies joue un rôle clé dans ledéveloppement de la recherche biomédicale en facilitant le développement d'entrepôts dedonnées articulés autour d'ontologies communes.

RDF Dataset Profiling-a Survey of Features; Methods; Applications and Vocabularies,Mohamed Ben Ellefi; Zohra Bellahsene; John G Breslin; Elena Demidova; Stefan Dietze; Julian Szymanski; Konstantin Todorov,Abstract. The Web of Data; and in particular Linked Data; has seen tremendous growth overthe past years. However; reuse and take-up of these rich data sources is often limited andfocused on a few well-known and established RDF datasets. This can be partially attributedto the lack of reliable and up-to-date information about the characteristics of availabledatasets. While RDF datasets vary heavily with respect to the features related to quality;coverage; dynamics and currency; reliable information about such features is essential toenable dataset discovery in tasks such as entity linking; distributed query; search or questionanswering. Even though there exists a wealth of works contributing to the problem of datasetprofiling in general; these works are spread across a wide range of communities. In thissurvey; we provide a first comprehensive survey of the RDF dataset profile features …,*,*,*

Efficient Projection of Ontologies,Hervé Panetto; Tharam Dillon; Johann Eder; Zohra Bellahsene; Norbert Ritter; Pieter De Leenheer,Abstract. In collaborative and interoperable information systems it is frequently necessary toexport a subset of an ontology; in particular to export all instances and axioms subsumed bya shared domain ontology. Technically this can be realized by projecting the Abox axioms ofthe private instances to the vocabulary of the shared ontology using a reasoner. We showthat the direct application of this method results in a very redundant export. Therefore; wepropose methods to generate a much smaller equivalent export in an efficient way. Thesemethods are based on a deep analysis of properties of axiom sets that can be used toefficiently filter redundancies during the export process and provide methods to furtherminimize redundancies in the result. We evaluate the performance and the degree ofminimality that can be reached with our approach with standard benchmarking ontologies …,*,*,*
