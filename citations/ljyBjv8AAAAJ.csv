Integrating classification and association rule mining,Bing Liu Wynne Hsu Yiming Ma; Bing Liu,*,Proceedings of the fourth international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining,1998,2773
Mining association rules with multiple minimum supports,Bing Liu; Wynne Hsu; Yiming Ma,Abstract Association rule mining is an important model in data mining. Its mining algorithmsdiscover all item associations (or rules) in the data that satisfy the user-specified minimumsupport (minsup) and minimum confidence (minconf) constraints. Minsup controls theminimum number of data cases that a rule must cover. Minconf controls the predictivestrength of the rule. Since only one minsup is used for the whole database; the modelimplicitly assumes that all items in the data are of the same nature and/or have similarfrequencies in the data. This is; however; seldom the case in reallife applications. In manyapplications; some items appear very frequently in the data; while others rarely appear. Ifminsup is set too high; those rules that involve rare items will not be found. To find rules thatinvolve both frequent and rare items; minsup has to be set very low. This may cause …,Proceedings of the fifth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,1999,837
Pruning and summarizing the discovered associations,Bing Liu; Wynne Hsu; Yiming Ma,Abstract Association rules are a fundamental class of patterns that exist in data. The keystrength of association rule mining is its completeness. It finds all associations in the datathat satisfy the user specified minimum support and minimum confidence constraints. Thisstrength; however; comes with a major drawback. It often produces a huge number ofassociations. This~ is particularly true for data sets whose attributes are highly correlated.The huge number of associations makes it very difficult; if not impossible; for a human userto analyze in order to identify those interesting/useful ones. In this paper; we propose anovel technique to overcome this problem. The technique first prunes the discoveredassociations to remove those insignificant associations; and then finds a special subset ofthe unpruned associations to form a summary of the discovered associations. We call this …,Proceedings of the fifth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,1999,517
Current research in the conceptual design of mechanical products,Wynne Hsu; Irene MY Woon,Abstract Decisions made at the conceptual design stage have significant influence onfactors such as costs; performance; reliability; safety and environmental impact of a product.However; knowledge of all the design requirements and constraints during this early phaseof a product's life cycle is usually imprecise; approximate or unknown. Faced with suchcomplexity; individual designers have restricted themselves to narrow; well-defined sub-tasks and as a result; progress in this area has been patchy and spasmodic. The purpose ofthis survey is to document the current state of research and development in this crucialdesign activity and in doing so; to identify avenues of fruitful exploration. In this paper; weprovide a comparison of the advantages/disadvantages and limitations between the varioustechniques/tools and; where applicable; suggest possible future research directions.,Computer-Aided Design,1998,359
Analyzing the subjective interestingness of association rules,Bing Liu; Wynne Hsu; Shu Chen; Yiming Ma,Association rules; a class of important regularities in databases; have proven very useful inpractical applications; but association-rule-mining algorithms tend to produce huge numbersof rules; most of which are of no interest. Users have considerable difficulty manuallyanalyzing so many rules to identify the truly interesting ones. To solve that problem; we havedeveloped a new approach to help them find interesting rules (in particular; unexpectedrules) from a set of discovered association rules. This interestingness analysis system (IAS)leverages the user's existing domain knowledge to analyze discovered associations andthen rank discovered rules according to various interestingness criteria; such as conformityand various types of unexpectedness. This article describes how we have implemented thistechnique and used it successfully in a number of applications.,IEEE Intelligent Systems and their Applications,2000,311
A prime number labeling scheme for dynamic ordered XML trees,Xiaodong Wu; Mong-Li Lee; Wynne Hsu,Efficient evaluation of XML queries requires the determination of whether a relationshipexists between two elements. A number of labeling schemes have been designed to labelthe element nodes such that the relationships between nodes can be easily determined bycomparing their labels. With the increased popularity of XML on the Web; finding a labelingscheme that is able to support order-sensitive queries in the presence of dynamic updatesbecomes urgent. We propose a new labeling scheme that take advantage of the uniqueproperty of prime numbers to meet this need. The global order of the nodes can be capturedby generating simultaneous congruence values from the prime number node labels.Theoretical analysis of the label size requirements for the various labeling schemes is given.Experiment results indicate that the prime number labeling scheme is compact compared …,Data Engineering; 2004.

XClust: clustering XML schemas for effective integration,Mong Li Lee; Liang Huai Yang; Wynne Hsu; Xia Yang,Abstract It is increasingly important to develop scalable integration techniques for thegrowing number of XML data sources. A practical starting point for the integration of largenumbers of Document Type Definitions (DTDs) of XML sources would be to first find clustersof DTDs that are similar in structure and semantics. Reconciling similar DTDs within such acluster will be an easier task than reconciling DTDs that are different in structure andsemantics as the latter would involve more restructuring. We introduce XClust; a novelintegration strategy that involves the clustering of DTDs. A matching algorithm based on thesemantics; immediate descendents and leaf-context similarity of DTD elements isdeveloped. Our experiments to integrate real world DTDs demonstrate the effectiveness ofthe XClust approach.,Proceedings of the eleventh international conference on Information and knowledge management,2002,297

An integrated color-spatial approach to content-based image retrieval,Wynne Hsu; ST Chua; HH Pung,Abstract The use of color information for image retrieval has been used widely in manycontent-based retrieval system with some success. However; histogram-based colorretrieval techniques suffer from a lack of important spatial knowledge. We discuss atechnique of integrating color information with spatial knowledge to obtain an overallimpression of the image. The technique involves three steps: the selection of a set ofrepresentative colors; the analysis of spatial information of the selected colors; and theretrieval process based on the integrated color-spatial information.,Proceedings of the third ACM international conference on Multimedia,1995,285
-Supporting Frequent Updates in R-Trees: A Bottom-Up Approach,Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu; Christian S Jensen; Bin Cui; Keng Lik Teo,This paper proposes a generalized bottom-up update strategy for R-trees. This strategy ismotivated by the class of monitoring applications; which are characterized by large volumesof updates; and the increasingly important role of indexing. This update strategy can easilybe applied to the members of the family of R-tree-based indexing techniques; as it preservesthe index structure and takes into account concurrency control. The strategy improves therobustness of R-trees by supporting different levels of index reorganization—ranging fromlocal to global—during updates; thus using expensive top-down updates only whennecessary. This chapter presents a compact main-memory summary structure along withefficient bottom-up algorithms that reduce the numbers of disk accesses and CPU resourcesused for update and querying. Empirical studies indicate that the new strategy …,*,2003,237

Finding interesting patterns using user expectations,Bing Liu; Wynne Hsu; Lai-Fun Mun; Hing-Yan Lee,One of the major problems in the field of knowledge discovery (or data mining) is theinterestingness problem. Past research and applications have found that; in practice; it is alltoo easy to discover a huge number of patterns in a database. Most of these patterns areactually useless or uninteresting to the user. But due to the huge number of patterns; it isdifficult for the user to comprehend them and to identify those interesting to him/her. Toprevent the user from being overwhelmed by the large number of patterns; techniques areneeded to rank them according to their interestingness. In this paper; we propose such atechnique; called the user-expectation method. In this technique; the user is first asked toprovide his/her expected patterns according to his/her past knowledge or intuitive feelings.Given these expectations; the system uses a fuzzy matching technique to match the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1999,211
An effective approach to detect lesions in color retinal images,Huan Wang; Wynne Hsu; Kheng Guan Goh; Mong Li Lee,Diabetic-related eye diseases are the most common cause of blindness in the world. So farthe most effective treatment for these eye diseases is early detection through regularscreening. To lower the cost of such screenings; we employ state-of-the-art imageprocessing techniques to automatically detect the presence of abnormalities in the retinalimages obtained during the screenings. The authors focus on one of the abnormal signs: thepresence of exudates/lesions in the retinal images. We propose a novel approach thatcombines brightness adjustment procedure with statistical classification method and local-window-based verification strategy. Experimental results indicate that we are able to achieve100% accuracy in terms of identifying all the retinal images with exudates while maintaininga 70% accuracy in correctly classifying the truly normal retinal images as normal.

Quantitative assessment of early diabetic retinopathy using fractal analysis,Ning Cheung; Kim C Donaghue; Gerald Liew; Sophie L Rogers; Jie Jin Wang; Shueh-Wen Lim; Alicia J Jenkins; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee; Tien Y Wong,OBJECTIVE—Fractal analysis can quantify the geometric complexity of the retinal vascularbranching pattern and may therefore offer a new method to quantify early diabeticmicrovascular damage. In this study; we examined the relationship between retinal fractaldimension and retinopathy in young individuals with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGNAND METHODS—We conducted a cross-sectional study of 729 patients with type 1 diabetes(aged 12–20 years) who had seven-field stereoscopic retinal photographs taken of botheyes. From these photographs; retinopathy was graded according to the modified AirlieHouse classification; and fractal dimension was quantified using a computer-based programfollowing a standardized protocol.

The role of domain knowledge in the detection of retinal hard exudates,Wynne Hsu; PMDS Pallawala; Mong Li Lee; Kah-Guan Au Eong,Diabetic retinopathy is a major cause of blindness in the world. Regular screening andtimely intervention can halt or reverse the progression of this disease. Digital retinal imagingtechnologies have become an integral part of eye screening programs worldwide due totheir greater accuracy and repeatability in staging diabetic retinopathy. These screeningprograms produce an enormous number of retinal images since diabetic patients typicallyhave both their eyes examined at least once a year. Automated detection of retinal lesionscan reduce the workload and increase the efficiency of doctors and other eye-carepersonnel reading the retinal images and facilitate the follow-up management of diabeticpatients. Existing techniques to detect retinal lesions are neither adaptable nor sufficientlysensitive and specific for real-life screening application.

Mining relationships among interval-based events for classification,Dhaval Patel; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Abstract Existing temporal pattern mining assumes that events do not have any duration.However; events in many real world applications have durations; and the relationshipsamong these events are often complex. These relationships are modeled using ahierarchical representation that extends Allen's interval algebra. However; thisrepresentation is lossy as the exact relationships among the events cannot be fullyrecovered. In this paper; we augment the hierarchical representation with additionalinformation to achieve a lossless representation. An efficient algorithm called IEMiner isdesigned to discover frequent temporal patterns from interval-based events. The algorithmemploys two optimization techniques to reduce the search space and remove non-promisingcandidates. From the discovered temporal patterns; we build an interval-based classifier …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,117
Multi-level organization and summarization of the discovered rules,Bing Liu; Minqing Hu; Wynne Hsu,ABSTRACT Many existing data mining techniques often produce a large number of rules;which make it very difficult for manual inspection of the rules to identify those interestingones. This problem represents a major gap between the results of data mining and theunderstanding and use of the mining results. In this paper; we argue that the key problem isnot with the large number of rules because if there are indeed many rules that exist in data;they should be discovered. The main problem is with our inability to organize; summarizeand present the rules in such a way that they can be easily analyzed by the user. In thispaper; we propose a technique to intuitively organize and summarize the discovered rules.With this organization; the discovered rules can be presented to the user in the way as wethink and talk about knowledge in our daily lives. This organization also allows the user to …,Proceedings of the sixth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2000,114

Automatic grading of retinal vessel caliber,Huiqi Li; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee; Tien Yin Wong,New clinical studies suggest that narrowing of the retinal blood vessels may be an earlyindicator of cardiovascular diseases. One measure to quantify the severity of retinalarteriolar narrowing is the arteriolar-to-venular diameter ratio (AVR). The manualcomputation of AVR is a tedious process involving repeated measurements of the diametersof all arterioles and venules in the retinal images by human graders. Consistency andreproducibility are concerns. To facilitate large-scale clinical use in the general population; itis essential to have a precise; efficient and automatic system to compute this AVR. Thispaper describes a new approach to obtain AVR. The starting points of vessels are detectedusing a matched Gaussian filter.

Mining changes for real-life applications,Bing Liu; Wynne Hsu; Heng-Siew Han; Yiyuan Xia,Abstract Much of the data mining research has been focused on devising techniques to buildaccurate models and to discover rules from databases. Relatively little attention has beenpaid to mining changes in databases collected over time. For businesses; knowing what ischanging and how it has changed is of crucial importance because it allows businesses toprovide the right products and services to suit the changing market needs. If undesirablechanges are detected; remedial measures need to be implemented to stop or to delay suchchanges. In many applications; mining for changes can be more important than producingaccurate models for prediction. A model; no matter how accurate; can only predict based onpatterns mined in the old data. That is; a model requires a stable environment; otherwise itwill cease to be accurate.

NeMoFinder: Dissecting genome-wide protein-protein interactions with meso-scale network motifs,Jin Chen; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee; See-Kiong Ng,Abstract Recent works in network analysis have revealed the existence of network motifs inbiological networks such as the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. However; existingmotif mining algorithms are not sufficiently scalable to find meso-scale network motifs. Also;there has been little or no work to systematically exploit the extracted network motifs fordissecting the vast interactomes. We describe an efficient network motif discovery algorithm;NeMoFinder; that can mine meso-scale network motifs that are repeated and unique in largePPI networks. Using NeMoFinder; we successfully discovered; for the first time; up to size-12network motifs in a large whole-genome S. cerevisiae (Yeast) PPI network. We also showthat such network motifs can be systematically exploited for indexing the reliability of PPIdata that were generated via highly erroneous high-throughput experimental methods.,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,99

A piecewise Gaussian model is proposed to describe the intensitydistribution of vessel profile in this paper. The characteristic of central reflex is speciallyconsidered in the proposed model. The comparison with the single Gaussian model isperformed; which shows that the piecewise Gaussian model is a more appropriate model forvessel profile. The obtained model parameters could be utilized in the identification of vesseltype. The minimum Mahalanobis distance classifier is employed in the classification. 505segments of vessels were tested.

Increasing confidence of protein interactomes using network topological metrics,Jin Chen; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee; See-Kiong Ng,Abstract Motivation: Experimental limitations in high-throughput protein–protein interactiondetection methods have resulted in low quality interaction datasets that contained sizablefractions of false positives and false negatives. Small-scale; focused experiments are thenneeded to complement the high-throughput methods to extract true protein interactions.However; the naturally vast interactomes would require much more scalable approaches.Results: We describe a novel method called IRAP* as a computational complement forrepurification of the highly erroneous experimentally derived protein interactomes.

We distinguish four levels of information: the Pixel Level; the Object Level;the Semantic Concept Level; and the Pattern and Knowledge Level. High-dimensionalindexing schemes and retrieval techniques are also included in the framework to support theflow of information among the levels. We believe this framework represents the first steptowards capturing the different levels of information present in image data and addressing …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2001,92
Efficient remote homology detection using local structure,Yuna Hou; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee; Christopher Bystroff,Abstract Motivation: The function of an unknown biological sequence can often beaccurately inferred if we are able to map this unknown sequence to its correspondinghomologous family. At present; discriminative methods such as SVM-Fisher and SVM-pairwise; which combine support vector machine (SVM) and sequence similarity; arerecognized as the most accurate methods; with SVM-pairwise being the most accurate.However; these methods typically encode sequence information into their feature vectorsand ignore the structure information.

SNNB computes different distanceneighborhoods of the input new object; lazily learns multiple Naïve Bayes classifiers; anduses the classifier with the highest estimated accuracy to make decision.

Feedback approach to design for assembly by evaluation of assembly plan,Wynne Hsu; CS George Lee; Shun-Feng Su,Abstract One of the questions that intrigues many researchers is that of how a product canbe designed that is good for assembly. A product which is assembly-oriented is easier andless costly to assemble. The benefits are many; but the ways of achieving it are certainly notunique. One way is the concurrent-engineering/design-for-assembly approach. In thisapproach; all the lifecycle issues are taken into consideration during the design phase. Adifferent but complementary approach is that of allowing redesign as soon as specificinformation is made available during a later stage of the lifecycle; such as the planningstage. The paper adopts the second approach. It examines how information available fromthe planning stage can aid in identifying areas for redesign. Evaluation criteria areformulated that provide enough information to allow redesign suggestions to be …,Computer-Aided Design,1993,87
Fast image retrieval using color-spatial information,Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Tat Seng Chua; Wynne Hsu,Abstract. In this paper; we present an image retrieval system that employs both the color andspatial information of images to facilitate the retrieval process. The basic unit used in ourtechnique is a single-colored cluster; which bounds a homogeneous region of that color inan image. Two clusters from two images are similar if they are of the same color and overlapin the image space. The number of clusters that can be extracted from an image can be verylarge; and it affects the accuracy of retrieval. We study the effect of the number of clusters onretrieval effectiveness to determine an appropriate value for “optimal''performance.

Discovering the set of fundamental rule changes,Bing Liu; Wynne Hsu; Yiming Ma,Abstract The world around us changes constantly. Knowing what has changed is animportant part of our lives. For businesses; recognizing changes is also crucial. It allowsbusinesses to adapt themselves to the changing market needs. In this paper; we studychanges of association rules from one time period to another. One approach is to comparethe supports and/or confidences of each rule in the two time periods and report thedifferences. This technique; however; is too simplistic as it tends to report a huge number ofrule changes; and many of them are; in fact; simply the snowball effect of a small subset offundamental changes. Here; we present a technique to highlight the small subset offundamental changes. A change is fundamental if it cannot be explained by some otherchanges.

Identifying non-actionable association rules,Bing Liu; Wynne Hsu; Yiming Ma,Abstract Building predictive models and finding useful rules are two important tasks of datamining. While building predictive models has been well studied; finding useful rules foraction still presents a major problem. A main obstacle is that many data mining algorithmsoften produce too many rules. Existing research has shown that most of the discovered rulesare actually redundant or insignificant. Pruning techniques have been developed to removethose spurious and/or insignificant rules. In this paper; we argue that being a significant rule(or a non-redundant rule); however; does not mean that it is a potentially useful rule foraction. Many significant rules (unpruned rules) are in fact not actionable. This paper studiesthis issue and presents an efficient algorithm to identify these non-actionable rules.Experiment results on many real-life datasets show that the number of non-actionable …,Proceedings of the seventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2001,73
Mining frequent query patterns from XML queries,Liang Huai Yang; Mong Li Lee; H Wynne; Sumit Acharya,As XML prevails over the Internet; the efficient retrieval of XML data becomes important.Research to improve query response times has been largely concentrate on indexing XMLdocuments and processing regular path expressions. Another approach is to discoverfrequent query patterns since the answers to these queries can be stored and indexed.Mining frequent query patterns requires more than simple tree matching since the XMLqueries involves special characters such as"*" or"//". In addition; the matching process canbe expensive since the search space is exponential to the size of XML schema. In thispaper; we present two mining algorithms; XQPMiner and XQPMinerTID; to discover frequentquery pattern frees from a large collection of XML queries efficiently.

Remote homolog detection using local sequence–structure correlations,Yuna Hou; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee; Christopher Bystroff,Abstract Remote homology detection refers to the detection of structural homology inproteins when there is little or no sequence similarity. In this article; we present a remotehomolog detection method called SVM-HMMSTR that overcomes the reliance on detectablesequence similarity by transforming the sequences into strings of hidden Markov states thatrepresent local folding motif patterns. These state strings are transformed into fixed-dimension feature vectors for input to a support vector machine. Two sets of features aredefined: an order-independent feature set that captures the amino acid and local structurecomposition; and an order-dependent feature set that captures the sequential ordering of thelocal structures. Tests using the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) 1.53 data setshow that the SVM-HMMSTR gives a significant improvement over several current …,PROTEINS: Structure; Function; and Bioinformatics,2004,66

They are foundto be very useful in practical applications. However; the number of association rulesdiscovered in a database can be huge; thus making manual inspection and analysis of therules difficult. In this paper; we propose a new framework to allow the user to explore thediscovered rules to identify those interesting ones. This framework has two components; aninterestingness analysis component; and a visualization component. The interestingnessanalysis component analyzes and organizes the discovered rules according to variousinterestingness criteria with respect to the user's existing knowledge.

Fractal analysis of retinal microvasculature and coronary heart disease mortality,Gerald Liew; Paul Mitchell; Elena Rochtchina; Tien Yin Wong; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee; Alan Wainwright; Jie Jin Wang,Abstract Aim Fractal analysis provides a global assessment of vascular network architecture.We examined the relationship of retinal vascular fractal dimension (D f) with coronary heartdisease (CHD) mortality. Methods and results We examined the relationship of D f with 14-year CHD mortality in a prospective; population-based cohort of 3303 participants aged 49years or older. D f was measured from digitized fundus photographs using computer-automated methods; CHD mortality was documented from Australian National Death Indexrecords. Mean D f in this population was 1.441 (standard deviation; 0.024). Over 14 years;there were 468 (14.2%) CHD deaths. Participants with suboptimal D f (lowest and highestquartiles) had 50% higher 14-year CHD mortality than those with optimal D f (middlequartiles); after adjusting for age; blood pressure; and other risk factors.

Discovering interesting holes in data,Bing Liu; Liang-Ping Ku; Wynne Hsu,Current machine learning and discovery techniques focus on discovering rules orregularities that exist in data. An important aspect of the research that has been ignored inthe past is the learning or discovering of interesting holes in the database. If we view eachcase in the database as a point in a k-dimensional space; then a hole is simply a region inthe space that contains no data point. Clearly; not every hole is interesting. Some holes areobvious because it is known that certain value combinations are not possible. Some holesexist because there are insufficient cases in the database. However; in some situations;empty regions do carry important information. For instance; they could warn us about somemissing value combinations that are either not known before or are unexpected. Knowingthese missing value combinations may lead to significant discoveries. In this paper; we …,IJCAI (2),1997,59
Exploration mining in diabetic patients databases: findings and conclusions,Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee; Bing Liu; Tok Wang Ling,ABSTRACT Real-life data mining applications are interesting because they often present adifferent set of problems for data miners. One such real-life application that we have done ison the diabetic patients databases. Valuable lessons are learnt from this application. Inparticular; we discover that the often neglected pre-processing and post-processing steps inknowledge discovery are the most critical elements in determining the success of a real-lifedata mining application. In this paper; we shall discuss how we carry out knowledgediscovery on this diabetic patient database; the interesting issues that have surfaced; as wellas the lessons we have learnt from this application. We will describe a semi-automaticmeans for cleaning the diabetic patient database; and present a step-by-step approach tohelp the health doctors explore their data and to understand the discovered rules better.,Proceedings of the sixth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2000,57
Cleaning the spurious links in data,Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu; Vijay Kothari,Data quality problems can arise from abbreviations; data entry mistakes; duplicate records;missing fields; and many other sources. These problems proliferate when you integratemultiple data sources in data warehousing; federated databases; and global informationsystems. A newly discovered class of erroneous data is spurious links; where a real-worldentity has multiple links that might not be properly associated with it. The existence of suchspurious links often leads to confusion and misrepresentation in the data recordsrepresenting the entity. Although the data set is well known for its high-quality bibliographicinformation; collecting and maintaining the data from diverse sources requires enormouseffort. Errors; including spurious links; are inevitable. To solve this problem; we use contextinformation to identify spurious links. First; we identify data records that contain potential …,IEEE Intelligent Systems,2004,54
Computing neck-shaft angle of femur for x-ray fracture detection,Tai Peng Tian; Ying Chen; Wee Kheng Leow; Wynne Hsu; Tet Sen Howe; Meng Ai Png,Abstract Worldwide; 30%–40% of women and 13% of men suffer from osteoporotic fracturesof the bone; particularly the older people. Doctors in the hospitals need to manually inspecta large number of x-ray images to identify the fracture cases. Automated detection offractures in x-ray images can help to lower the workload of doctors by screening out the easycases; leaving a small number of difficult cases and the second confirmation to the doctors toexamine more closely. To our best knowledge; such a system does not exist as yet. Thispaper describes a method of measuring the neck-shaft angle of the femur; which is one ofthe main diagnostic rules that doctors use to determine whether a fracture is present at thefemur. Experimental tests performed on test images confirm that the method is accurate inmeasuring neck-shaft angle and detecting certain types of femur fractures.,International Conference on Computer Analysis of Images and Patterns,2003,53
Mining dense periodic patterns in time series data,Chang Sheng; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Existing techniques to mine periodic patterns in time series data are focused on discoveringfull-cycle periodic patterns from an entire time series. However; many useful partial periodicpatterns are hidden in long and complex time series data. In this paper; we aim to discoverthe partial periodicity in local segments of the time series data. We introduce the notion ofcharacter density to partition the time series into variable-length fragments and to determinethe lower bound of each character's period. We propose a novel algorithm; called DPMiner;to find the dense periodic patterns in time series data. Experimental results on both syntheticand real-life datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective and efficient toreveal interesting dense periodic patterns.,Data Engineering; 2006.

On the accurate counting of tumor cells,Bin Fang; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Quantitative analysis of tumor cells is fundamental to pathological studies. Current practicesare mostly manual; time-consuming; and tedious; yielding subjective and imprecise results.To understand the behavior of tumor cells; it is critical to have an objective way to countthese cells. In addition; these counts must be reproducible and independent of the personperforming the count. In this work; we propose a two-stage tumor cell identification strategy.In the first stage; potential tumor cells are segmented automatically using local adaptivethresholding and dynamic water immersion techniques. Unfortunately; due to histologicalnoise in the images; a large number of false identifications are obtained. To improve theaccuracy of the identified tumor cells; a second stage of feature rules mining is initiated.Experiment results show that image processing techniques alone are unable to give …,IEEE Transactions on nanobioscience,2003,51
Making recommendations from multiple domains,Wei Chen; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Abstract Given the vast amount of information on the World Wide Web; recommendersystems are increasingly being used to help filter irrelevant data and suggest informationthat would interest users. Traditional systems make recommendations based on a singledomain eg; movie or book domain. Recent work has examined the correlations in differentdomains and designed models that exploit user preferences on a source domain to predictuser preferences on a target domain. However; these methods are based on matrixfactorization and can only be applied to two-dimensional data. Transferring highdimensional data from one domain to another requires decomposing the high dimensionaldata to binary relations which results in information loss. Furthermore; this decompositioncreates a large number of matrices that need to be transferred and combining them in the …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,49
Generative; discriminative; and ensemble learning on multi-modal perceptual fusion toward news video story segmentation,WH-M Hsu; Shih-Fu Chang,News video story segmentation is a critical task for automatic video indexing andsummarization. Our prior work has demonstrated promising performance by using agenerative model; called maximum entropy (ME); which models the posterior probabilitygiven the multi-modal perceptual features near the candidate points. In this paper; weinvestigate alternative statistical approaches based on discriminative models; ie supportvector machine (SVM); and ensemble learning; ie boosting. In addition; we develop a novelapproach; called BoostME; which uses the ME classifiers and the associated confidencescores in each boosting iteration. We evaluated these different methods using the TRECVID2003 broadcast news data set. We found that SVM-based and ME-based techniques bothoutperformed the pure boosting techniques; with the SVM-based solutions achieving …,Multimedia and Expo; 2004.

Temporal and spatio-temporal data mining,Wynne Hsu,The recent surge of interest in spatio-temporal databases has resulted in numerousadvances; such as: modeling; indexing; and querying of moving objects and spatio-temporaldata. Aside from this; rule mining in spatial databases and temporal databases has beenstudied extensively in data mining research. Temporal and Spatio-Temporal Data Mining:Association Patterns and Applications examines the problem of mining topological patternsin spatio-temporal databases by imposing the temporal constraints into the process ofmining spatial collocation patterns.

Reconstruction of vascular structures in retinal images,Bin Fang; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Vessels in retinal fundus images are useful in revealing the severity of eye-related diseases.In addition; they can act as landmarks for localizing lesions and the central vision area; andguide laser treatment of neovascularization. In this paper; we propose a two-stage method toidentify and extract vascular structure. First; the vessels are enhanced by mathematicalmorphology with respect to their spatial properties. These vessels are differentiated frombackground patterns through the use of curvature evaluation and linear filtering. However;this may result in missing out some important features of bifurcation and intersection points.To overcome this; a reconstruction process is performed using dynamic local region growingto recover the complete vascular structure. Experiment results indicate that the proposedmethod is able to detect the vascular structure in 97% of 35 retinal images with …,Image Processing; 2003. ICIP 2003.

An evaluation of XML indexes for structural join,Hanyu Li; Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu; Chao Chen,Abstract XML queries differ from relational queries in that the former are expressed as pathexpressions. The efficient handling of structural relationships has become a key factor inXML query processing. Many index-based solutions have been proposed for efficientstructural join in XML queries. This work explores the state-of-the-art indexes; namely;< i>B</i>< sup>+</sup>-tree; XB-tree and XR-tree; and analyzes how well they support XMLstructural joins. Experiment results indicate that all three indexes yield comparableperformances for non-recursive XML data; while the XB-tree outperforms the rest for highlyrecursive XML data.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2004,45
Automated optic disc localization and contour detection using ellipse fitting and wavelet transform,PMDS Pallawala; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee; Kah-Guan Au Eong,Abstract Optic disc detection is important in the computer-aided analysis of retinal images. Itis crucial for the precise identification of the macula to enable successful grading of macularpathology such as diabetic maculopathy. However; the extreme variation of intensityfeatures within the optic disc and intensity variations close to the optic disc boundarypresents a major obstacle in automated optic disc detection. The presence of blood vessels;crescents and peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy seen in myopic patients also increase thecomplexity of detection. Existing techniques have not addressed these difficult cases; andare neither adaptable nor sufficiently sensitive and specific for real-life application. This workpresents a novel algorithm to detect the optic disc based on wavelet processing and ellipsefitting. We first employ Daubechies wavelet transform to approximate the optic disc region …,European conference on computer vision,2004,45
Simultaneously identifying all true vessels from segmented retinal images,Qiangfeng Peter Lau; Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu; Tien Yin Wong,Measurements of retinal blood vessel morphology have been shown to be related to the riskof cardiovascular diseases. The wrong identification of vessels may result in a largevariation of these measurements; leading to a wrong clinical diagnosis. In this paper; weaddress the problem of automatically identifying true vessels as a postprocessing step tovascular structure segmentation. We model the segmented vascular structure as a vesselsegment graph and formulate the problem of identifying vessels as one of finding the optimalforest in the graph given a set of constraints. We design a method to solve this optimizationproblem and evaluate it on a large real-world dataset of 2446 retinal images.

Discovering reliable protein interactions from high-throughput experimental data using network topology,Jin Chen; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee; See-Kiong Ng,Summary Objective: Current protein–protein interaction (PPI) detection via high-throughputexperimental methods; such as yeast-two-hybrid has been reported to be highly erroneous;leading to potentially costly spurious discoveries. This work introduces a novel measurecalled IRAP; ie “interaction reliability by alternative path”; for assessing the reliability ofprotein interactions based on the underlying topology of the PPI network. Methods andmaterials: A candidate PPI is considered to be reliable if it is involved in a closed loop inwhich the alternative path of interactions between the two interacting proteins is strong. Wedevise an algorithm called AlternativePathFinder to compute the IRAP value for eachinteraction in a complex PPI network. Validation of the IRAP as a measure for assessing thereliability of PPIs is performed with extensive experiments on yeast PPI data. All the data …,Artificial Intelligence in Medicine,2005,44
Maxfirst for maxbrknn,Zenan Zhou; Wei Wu; Xiaohui Li; Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu,The MaxBRNN problem finds a region such that setting up a new service site within thisregion would guarantee the maximum number of customers by proximity. This problemassumes that each customer only uses the service provided by his/her nearest service site.However; in reality; a customer tends to go to his/her k nearest service sites. To handle this;MaxBRNN can be extended to the MaxBRkNN problem which finds an optimal region suchthat setting up a service site in this region guarantees the maximum number of customerswho would consider the site as one of their k nearest service locations. We furthergeneralize the MaxBRkNN problem to reflect the real world scenario where customers mayhave different preferences for different service sites; and at the same time; service sites mayhave preferred targeted customers.

A framework for mining topological patterns in spatio-temporal databases,Junmei Wang; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Abstract Mining topological patterns in spatial databases has received a lot of attention.However; existing work typically ignores the temporal aspect and suffers from certainefficiency problems. They are not scalable for mining topological patterns in spatio-temporaldatabases. In this paper; we study the problem for mining topological patterns byincorporating the temporal aspect in the mining process. We introduce a summary-structurethat records the instances' count information of a feature in a region within a time window.Using this structure; we design an algorithm; TopologyMiner; to find interesting topologicalpatterns without the need to generate candidates. Experimental results show thatTopologyMiner is effective and scalable in finding topological patterns and outperformsApriori-like algorithm by a few orders of magnitudes.,Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2005,43
XML clustering by principal component analysis,Jianghui Liu; Jason TL Wang; Wynne Hsu; Katherine G Herbert,XML is increasingly important in data exchange and information management. A largeamount of efforts have been spent in developing efficient techniques for storing; querying;indexing and accessing XML documents. In This work we propose a new approach toclustering XML data. In contrast to previous work; which focused on documents defined bydifferent DTDs; the proposed method works for documents with the same DTD. Ourapproach is to extract features from documents; modeled by ordered labeled trees; andtransform the documents to vectors in a high-dimensional Euclidean space based on theoccurrences of the features in the documents. We then reduce the dimensionality of thevectors by principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster the vectors in the reduceddimensional space. The PCA enables one to identify vectors with co-occurrent features …,Tools with Artificial Intelligence; 2004. ICTAI 2004. 16th IEEE International Conference on,2004,43

Synthesis of design concepts from a design for assembly perspective,Wynne Hsu; YH Jerry Fuh; Yunfeng Zhang,Abstract Assembly is often a labor intensive and costly process. Techniques such as designfor assembly; and automatic assembly planning have been reported in an attempt to lowerthe high cost of assembly. Automatic assembly planning is concerned with finding theoptimal sequence of assembly for a given design. On the other hand; design for assembly(DFA) examines the given design to evaluate its 'fitness' for assembly; and whereappropriate; to provide high-level suggestions to redesign the components so that they areeasy to be assembled. Usually; DFA analysis is performed only when the design details areknown (the number; types; and shapes of components and their mating relationships). As aresult; designers tend to view this as an extra step/burden. To change this perspective; weinvestigate a new approach whereby DFA analysis is used to guide the designer in the …,Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems,1998,42
Increasing temporal diversity with purchase intervals,Gang Zhao; Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu; Wei Chen,Abstract The development of Web 2.0 technology has led to huge economic benefits andchallenges for both e-commerce websites and online shoppers. One core technology toincrease sales and consumers' satisfaction is the use of recommender systems. Existingproduct recommender systems consider the order of items purchased by users to obtain alist of recommended items. However; they do not consider the time interval between theproducts purchased. For example; there is often an interval of 2-3 months between thepurchase of printer ink cartridges or refills. Thus; recommending appropriate ink cartridgesone week before the user needs to replace the depleted ink cartridges would increase thelikelihood of a purchase decision. In this paper; we propose to utilize the purchase intervalinformation to improve the performance of the recommender systems for e-commerce.

Labeling network motifs in protein interactomes for protein function prediction,Jin Chen; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee; See-Kiong Ng,Biological networks such as the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network have been found tocontain small recurring subnetworks in significantly higher frequencies than in randomnetworks. Such network motifs are useful for uncovering structural design principles ofcomplex biological networks. However; current network motif finding algorithms models thePPI network as a uni-labeled graph; discovering only unlabeled and thus relativelyuninforma-tive network motifs as a result. Our objective is to exploit the currently availablebiological information that are associated with the vertices (the proteins) to capture not onlythe topological shapes of the motifs; but also the biological context in which they occurred inthe PPI networks for network motif applications. We present a method called LaMoFinder tolabel network motifs with gene ontology terms in a PPI network. We also show how the …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007.

Detection of retinal blood vessels based on nonlinear projections,Yongping Zhang; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Abstract An automated method for blood vessel segmentation is presented in this paper. Theapproach uses the nonlinear orthogonal projection to capture the features of vesselnetworks; and derives a novel local adaptive thresholding algorithm for vessel detection. Byembedding in a kind of image decomposition model; the selection of system parameterwhich reflects the size of concerned convex set is examined. This approach differs frompreviously known methods in that it uses matched filtering; vessel tracking or supervisedmethods. The algorithm was tested on two publicly available databases: the DRIVE and theSTARE. By comparison with hand-labeled ground truth; an average accuracy of 96.1% isachieved on the former database; and an average accuracy of 90.8% is achieved on thelater database.,Journal of Signal Processing Systems,2009,34
Intuitive representation of decision trees using general rules and exceptions,Bing Liu; Minqing Hu; Wynne Hsu,Abstract Producing too many rules is a major problem with many data mining techniques.This paper argues that one of the key reasons for the large number of rules is that aninefficient knowledge representation scheme has been used. The current predominantrepresentation of the discovered knowledge is the if-then rules. This representation oftenseverely fragments the knowledge that exists in the data; thereby resulting in a large numberof rules. The fragmentation also makes the discovered rules hard to understand and to use.In this paper; we propose a more efficient representation scheme; called general rules &exceptions. In this representation; a unit of knowledge consists of a single general rule and aset of exceptions. This scheme reduces the complexity of the discovered knowledgesubstantially. It is also intuitive and easy to understand. This paper focuses on using the …,AAAI/IAAI,2000,33
Community-based user recommendation in uni-directional social networks,Gang Zhao; Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu; Wei Chen; Haoji Hu,Abstract Advances in Web 2.0 technology has led to the rising popularity of many socialnetwork services. For example; there are over 500 million active users in Twitter. Given thehuge number of users; user recommendation has gained importance where the goal is tofind a set of users whom a target user is likely to follow. Content-based approaches that relyon tweet content for user recommendation have low precision as tweet contents are typicallyshort and noisy; while collaborative filtering approaches that utilize follower-followeerelationships lead to higher precision but data sparsity remains a challenge. In this work; wepropose a community-based approach to user recommendation in Twitter-style socialnetworks. Forming communities enables us to reduce data sparsity as the focus is ondiscover the latent characteristics of communities instead of individuals.

Clustering in dynamic spatial databases,Ji Zhang; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Abstract Efficient clustering in dynamic spatial databases is currently an open problem withmany potential applications. Most traditional spatial clustering algorithms are inadequatebecause they do not have an efficient support for incremental clustering. In this paper; wepropose DClust; a novel clustering technique for dynamic spatial databases. DClust is ableto provide multi-resolution view of the clusters; generate arbitrary shapes clusters in thepresence of noise; generate clusters that are insensitive to ordering of input data andsupport incremental clustering efficiently. DClust utilizes the density criterion that capturesarbitrary cluster shapes and sizes to select a number of representative points; and builds theMinimum Spanning Tree (MST) of these representative points; called R-MST. After the initialclustering; a summary of the cluster structure is built. This summary enables quick …,Journal of intelligent information systems,2005,30
Finding hot query patterns over an XQuery stream,Liang Huai Yang; Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu,Abstract. Caching query results is one efficient approach to improving the performance ofXML management systems. This entails the discovery of frequent XML queries issued byusers. In this paper; we model user queries as a stream of XML query pattern trees and minethe frequent query patterns over the query stream. To facilitate the one-pass mining process;we devise a novel data structure called DTS to summarize the pattern trees seen so far. Bygrouping the incoming pattern trees into batches; we can dynamically mark the activeportion of the current batch in DTS and limit the enumeration of candidate trees to only thecurrently active pattern trees. We also design another summary data structure called ECTreethat provides for the incremental computation of the frequent tree patterns over the querystream. Based on the above two constructs; we present two mining algorithms called …,The VLDB Journal,2004,30
Mining viewpoint patterns in image databases,Wynne Hsu; Jing Dai; Mong Li Lee,Abstract The increasing number of image repositories has made image mining an importanttask because of its potential in discovering useful image patterns from a large set of images.In this paper; we introduce the notion of viewpoint patterns for image databases. Viewpointpatterns refer to patterns that capture the invariant relationships of one object from the pointof view of another object. These patterns are unique and significant in images because theabsolute positional information of objects for most images is not important; but rather; it is therelative distance and orientation of the objects from each other that is meaningful. We designa scalable and efficient algorithm to discover such viewpoint patterns. Experiments resultson various image sets demonstrate that viewpoint patterns are meaningful and interesting tohuman users.,Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2003,30

Modeling user's receptiveness over time for recommendation,Wei Chen; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Abstract Existing recommender systems model user interests and the social influencesindependently. In reality; user interests may change over time; and as the interests change;new friends may be added while old friends grow apart and the new friendships formed maycause further interests change. This complex interaction requires the joint modeling of userinterest and social relationships over time. In this paper; we propose a probabilisticgenerative model; called Receptiveness over Time Model (RTM); to capture this interaction.We design a Gibbs sampling algorithm to learn the receptiveness and interest distributionsamong users over time. The results of experiments on a real world dataset demonstrate thatRTM-based recommendation outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation methods.Case studies also show that RTM is able to discover the user interest shift and …,Proceedings of the 36th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2013,27
Increasing confidence of protein-protein interactomes,Jin Chen; Hon Nian Chua; Wynne Hsu; Mong-Li Lee; See-Kiong Ng; Rintaro Saito; Wing-Kin Sung; Limsoon Wong,抄録 High-throughput experimental methods; such as yeast-two-hybrid and phage display;have fairly high levels of false positives (and false negatives).

Correlation-based detection of attribute outliers,Judice LY Koh; Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu; Kai Tak Lam,Abstract An outlier is an object that does not conform to the normal behavior of the data set.In data cleaning; outliers are identified for data noise reduction. In applications such as frauddetection; and stock market analysis; outliers suggest abnormal behavior requiring furtherinvestigation. Existing outlier detection methods have focused on class outliers and researchon attribute outliers is limited; despite the equal role attribute outliers play in depreciatingdata quality and reducing data mining accuracy. In this paper; we propose a novel method todetect attribute outliers from the deviating correlation behavior of attributes. We formulatethree metrics to evaluate outlier-ness of attributes; and introduce an adaptive factor todistinguish outliers from non-outliers. Experiments with both synthetic and real-world datasets indicate that the proposed method is effective in detecting attribute outliers.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,26

Existing works have focused on the selectivityestimation of XML queries without order-based axes. In this work; we develop a frameworkto estimate the result sizes of XPath expressions with order-based axes. We describe howthe path and order information of XML elements can be captured and summarized incompact data structures. We also describe methods to estimate the selectivity of XPathqueries.

ERkNN: efficient reverse k-nearest neighbors retrieval with local kNN-distance estimation,Chenyi Xia; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Abstract The Reverse k-Nearest Neighbors (RkNN) queries are important in profile-basedmarketing; information retrieval; decision support and data mining systems. However; theyare very expensive and existing algorithms are not scalable to queries in high dimensionalspaces or of large values of k. This paper describes an efficient estimation-based RkNNsearch algorithm (ERkNN) which answers RkNN queries based on local kNN-distanceestimation methods. The proposed approach utilizes estimation-based filtering strategy tolower the computation cost of RkNN queries. The results of extensive experiments on bothsynthetic and real life datasets demonstrate that ERkNN algorithm retrieves RkNN efficientlyand is scalable with respect to data dimensionality; k; and data size.,Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2005,26
Flowminer: Finding flow patterns in spatio-temporal databases,Junmei Wang; Wynne Hsu; Mong-Li Lee,The widespread use of spatio-temporal databases and applications has fuelled an urgentneed to discover interesting time and space patterns in such databases. While much workhas been done in discovering time/sequence patterns or spatial patterns; discovering ofpatterns involving both time and space dimensions is still in its infancy; We introduce theconcept of flow patterns. Flow patterns are intended to describe the change of events overspace and time. These flow patterns are useful to the understanding of many real-lifeapplications. We present a disk-based algorithm; FlowMiner; which utilizes temporalrelationships and spatial relationships amid events to generate flow patterns. Ourperformance study shows that FlowMiner is both scalable and efficient. Experiments on real-life datasets also reveal interesting flow patterns.,Tools with Artificial Intelligence; 2004.

The focus of this paper is placed on the informationderivation of spatial data. Geographical coordinates of hot spots in forest fire regions; whichare extracted from the satellite images; are studied and used in the detection of likely firepoints. False alarms can occur in the derived hotspots. While this false information can beidentified by comparing the radiance detected at several bands; we introduce a differentapproach to remove some of the false alarms. We use clustering and a Houghtransformation to determine regular patterns in the derived hotspots and classify them asfalse alarms on the assumption that fires usually do not spread in regular patterns such as ina straight line. This project demonstrates the application of spatial data mining to reduce …,Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium; 2003. IGARSS'03. Proceedings. 2003 IEEE International,2003,25
Concept lattice based composite classifiers for high predictability,Zhipeng Xie; Wynne Hsu; Zongtian Liu; Mong Li Lee,Concept lattice model; the core structure in formal concept analysis; has been successfullyapplied in software engineering and knowledge discovery. This paper integrates the simplebase classifier (Naïve Bayes or Nearest Neighbour) into each node of the concept lattice toform a new composite classifier. Two new classification systems are developed; CLNB andCLNN; which employ efficient constraints to search for interesting patterns and votingstrategy to classify a new object. CLNB integrates the Naïïve Bayes base classifier intoconcept nodes while CLNN incorporates the Nearest Neighbour base classifier into conceptnodes. Experimental results indicate that these two composite classifiers greatly improve theaccuracy of their corresponding base classifier. In addition; CLNB even outperforms threeother state-of-the-art classification methods; NBTree; CBA and C4. 5 Rules.,Journal of Experimental & Theoretical Artificial Intelligence,2002,25
A unified framework for recommendations based on quaternary semantic analysis,Chen Wei; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Abstract Social network systems such as FaceBook and YouTube have played a significantrole in capturing both explicit and implicit user preferences for different items in the form ofratings and tags. This forms a quaternary relationship among users; items; tags and ratings.Existing systems have utilized only ternary relationships such as users-items-ratings; orusers-items-tags to derive their recommendations. In this paper; we show that ternaryrelationships are insufficient to provide accurate recommendations. Instead; we model thequaternary relationship among users; items; tags and ratings as a 4-order tensor and castthe recommendation problem as a multi-way latent semantic analysis problem. A unifiedframework for user recommendation; item recommendation; tag recommendation and itemrating prediction is proposed. The results of extensive experiments performed on a real …,Proceedings of the 34th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in Information Retrieval,2011,23
A partition-based approach to graph mining,Junmei Wang; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee; Chang Sheng,Existing graph mining algorithms typically assume that databases are relatively static andcan fit into the main memory. Mining of subgraphs in a dynamic environment is currentlybeyond the scope of these algorithms. To bridge this gap; we first introduce a partition-basedapproach called PartMiner for mining graphs. The PartMiner algorithm finds the frequentsubgraphs by dividing the database into smaller and more manageable units; miningfrequent subgraphs on these smaller units and finally combining the results of these units tolosslessly recover the complete set of subgraphs in the database. Next; we extend PartMinerto handle updates in the dynamic environment. Experimental results indicate that PartMineris effective and scalable in finding frequent subgraphs; and outperforms existing algorithmsin the presence of updates.,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06.

Exploring essential attributes for detecting microRNA precursors from background sequences,Yun Zheng; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee; Limsoon Wong,Abstract MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play important roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation. The hairpin structure is a key characteristic of themicroRNAs precursors (pre-miRNAs). How to encode their hairpin structures is a critical stepto correctly detect the pre-miRNAs from background sequences; ie; pseudo miRNAprecursors. In this paper; we have proposed to encode the hairpin structures of the pre-miRNA with a set of features; which captures both the global and local structurecharacteristics of the pre-miRNAs. Furthermore; we find that four essential attributes arediscriminatory for classifying human pre-miRNAs and background sequences with aninformation theory approach. The experimental results show that the number of conservedessential attributes decreases when the phylogenetic distance between the species …,VLDB Workshop on Data Mining and Bioinformatics,2006,21
Mining generalized spatio-temporal patterns,Junmei Wang; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Abstract Spatio-temporal databases offer a rich repository and opportunities to developtechniques for discovering new types of spatio-temporal patterns. In this paper; we introducea new class of spatio-temporal patterns; called the generalized spatio-temporal patterns; todescribe the repeated sequences of events that occur within small neighbourhoods. Suchpatterns are crucial to the understanding of habitual patterns. To discover this class ofpatterns; we develop an algorithm GenSTMiner based on the idea of pattern growthapproach; and introduce some optimization techniques that are used to reduce the numberof candidates generated and minimize the size of the projected databases. Our performancestudy indicates that GenSTMiner is highly efficient and outperforms PrefixSpan.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2005,20
Automated microaneurysm segmentation and detection using generalized eigenvectors,PMDS Pallawala; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee; Say Song Goh,Diabetic retinopathy is a major cause of blindness and microaneurysms are the first clinicallyobservable manifestations of diabetic retinopathy. Regular screening and timely interventioncan halt or reverse the progression of this disease. This paper describes an approach that isbased on the generalized eigenvectors of affinity matrix to extract microaneurysms fromdigital retinal images. Microaneurysms are in the low intensity regions and detection iscomplicated by their small sizes; the presence of retinal vessels; and their similarity toanother type of retinal abnormality-haemorrhages. In order to accurately detectmicroaneurysms; the affinity matrix is defined to suppress larger structures such as bloodvessels; haemorrhages; etc and to create uniform affinity distribution for pixels belonging tomicroaneurysms.

Efficient mining of frequent XML query patterns with repeating-siblings,Liang Huai Yang; Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu; Decai Huang; Limsoon Wong,Abstract A recent approach to improve the performance of XML query evaluation is to cachethe query results of frequent query patterns. Unfortunately; discovering these frequent querypatterns is an expensive operation. In this paper; we develop a two-pass mining algorithm2PXMiner that guarantees the discovery of frequent query patterns by scanning thedatabase at most twice. By exploiting a transaction summary data structure; and anenumeration tree; we are able to determine the upper bounds of the frequencies of thecandidate patterns; and to quickly prune away the infrequent patterns. We also design anindex to trace the repeating candidate subtrees generated by sibling repetition; thusavoiding redundant computations. Experiments results indicate that 2PXMiner is bothefficient and scalable.,Information and Software Technology,2008,19
Approximating content-based object-level image retrieval,Wynne Hsu; Tat-Seng Chua; Hung Keng  Pung,Abstract Object-level image retrieval is an active area of research. Given an image; a humanobserver does not see random dots of colors. Rather; he/she observes familiar objects in theimage. Therefore; to make image retrieval more user-friendly and more effective andefficient; object-level image retrieval technique is necessary. Unfortunately; images todayare mostly represented as 2D arrays of pixels values. The object-level semantics of theimages are not captured. Researchers try to overcome this problem by attempting to deducethe object-level semantics through additional information such as the motion vectors in thecase of video clips. Some success stories have been reported. However; deducing object-level semantics from still images is still a difficult problem. In this paper; we propose a “color-spatial” approach to approximate object-level image retrieval. The color and spatial …,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2000,19
Scheduling multimedia applications under overload and non-deterministic conditions,Teik Guan Tan; Wynne Hsu,Scheduling multimedia applications is not straightforward. The deterministic techniques inhard real-time scheduling; though applicable; are not absolutely necessary and insteadresult in very conservative execution. Current real-time scheduling research does notproperly address the problem of scheduling under overload and nondeterministic situations.In this paper; we introduce a more representative task model for multimedia applications. Wedescribe the use of a frequency parameter; associated with the tasks; which can serve toregulate execution during degradation (when the system is overloaded).

Feedback evaluation of assembly plans,Wynne Hsu; CS George Lee; Shun-Feng Su,The authors examine issues involved in integrating the design level and the assemblyplanning level with a feedback loop. The integration is performed in two stages. The firststage focuses on the evaluation of an assembly plan. Evaluation criteria that can pinpointareas which need redesign are defined. The second stage is to use the evaluation results tocome up with the actual redesign. Algorithms are developed for performing evaluation ofassembly plans. From the evaluation results; means of generating hints for redesign arediscussed. The hints are then processed and calls are made to the redesign operators toperform the actual redesign of components. The integrated design-planning system has theability to identify parts that need redesign and the ability to come up with feasible redesignoptions in polynomial time.,Robotics and Automation; 1992.

Linking temporal records for profiling entities,Furong Li; Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu; Wang-Chiew Tan,Abstract To harness the rich amount of information available on the Web today; manyorganizations start to aggregate public (and private) data to derive new knowledge bases. Afundamental challenge in constructing an accurate integrated knowledge repository fromdifferent data sources is to understand how facts across different sources are related to oneanother over time. This challenge; referred to as the temporal record linkage problem; goesfar beyond the traditional record linkage problem as it requires a fine-grained analysis ofhow two facts are temporally related if they both refer to the same entity. In this paper; wepresent a new solution for understanding how two facts may be temporally related andexploit the knowledge to profile how entities evolve over time. Our solution makes use of anovel transition model which captures sophisticated patterns of value transitions …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,17
Answering top-k similar region queries,Chang Sheng; Yu Zheng; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee; Xing Xie,Abstract Advances in web technology have given rise to new information retrievalapplications. In this paper; we present a model for geographical region search and call thisclass of query similar region query. Given a spatial map and a query region; a similar regionsearch aims to find the top-k most similar regions to the query region on the spatial map. Wedesign a quadtree based algorithm to access the spatial map at different resolution levels.The proposed search technique utilizes a filter-and-refine manner to prune regions that arenot likely to be part of the top-k results; and refine the remaining regions. Experimental studybased on a real world dataset verifies the effectiveness of the proposed region similaritymeasure and the efficiency of the algorithm.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,17
Discovering spatial interaction patterns,Chang Sheng; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Advances in sensing and satellite technologies and the growth of Internet haveresulted in the easy accessibility of vast amount of spatial data. Extracting useful knowledgefrom these data is an important and challenging task; in particular; finding interaction amongspatial features. Existing works typically adopt a grid-like approach to transform thecontinuous spatial space to a discrete space. In this paper; we propose to model the spatialfeatures in a continuous space through the use of influence functions. For each feature type;we build an influence map that captures the distribution of the feature instances.Superimposing the influence maps allows the interaction of the feature types to be quicklydetermined. Experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets indicate that theproposed approach is scalable and is able to discover patterns that have been missed by …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2008,17
Path-augmented keyword search for XML documents,Wynne Hsu; Mong-Li Lee; Xiaodong Wu,Keyword search is easy to use since it does not require the prior knowledge of querylanguages or the structure of the underlying data. However; keyword search does not utilizethe rich information encoded in the structures of XML to aid in the retrieval of documents. InThis work; we devise a context-aware approach for searching XML to improve theeffectiveness of keyword search on XML via query expansion. We find a set of XML pathexpressions that capture the contextual meaning of a keyword query. Paths in the contexts ofthe query are used to expand the original query to improve the effectiveness of keywordsearch on XML. Empirical results indicate that the proposed path-augmented keywordsearch of XML documents outperforms current keyword expansion and keyword proximitysearch techniques.,Tools with Artificial Intelligence; 2004.

Effective detection of retinal exudates in fundus images,Huan Wang; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Diabetic-related eye diseases are the most common cause of blindness in the world. Earlydetection through regular screenings is the most effective treatment for these eye diseases.To improve the efficiency of such screenings; it is very important that effectively finding thepresence of abnormalities in the retinal images captured during the screenings. In thispaper; it is focused on automatically detecting one of the abnormal signs: the presenceof'exudates/lesions in the retinal images. A novel approach that combines median filteringand dynamic clustering analysis is proposed. Experimental results indicate that the newalgorithm is easier; faster and more effective for lesion detection from retinal images ofvarious qualities.,Biomedical Engineering and Informatics; 2009.

Consistent top-k queries over time,Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu; Ling Li; Wee Hyong Tok,Abstract Top-k queries have been well-studied in snapshot databases and data streams. Weobserve that decision-makers are often interested in a set of objects that exhibit a certaindegree of consistent behavior over time. We introduce a new class of queries calledconsistent top-k to retrieve k objects that are always amongst the top at every time point overa specified time interval. Applying top-k methods at each time point leads to largeintermediate results and wasted computations. We design two methods; rank-based andbitmap; to address these shortcomings. Experiment results indicate that the proposedmethods are efficient and scalable; and consistent top-k queries are practical in real worldapplications.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2009,15
Systematic assessment of high-throughput experimental data for reliable protein interactions using network topology,Jin Chen; Wynne Hsu; M Li Lee; S-K Ng,Current protein interaction detection via high-throughput experimental methods such asyeast-two-hybrid has been reported to be highly erroneous. This work introduces a novelmeasure called IRAP for assessing the reliability of protein interaction based on theunderlying topology of the protein interaction network. A candidate protein interaction isconsidered to be reliable if it is involved in a closed loop in which the alternative path ofinteractions between the two interacting proteins is strong. We design an algorithm tocompute the IRAP value for each interaction in a protein interaction network. Validation ofIRAP as a measure for assessing the reliability of protein-protein interactions fromconventional high-throughput experiments is performed.

The impact of wiring constraints on hierarchical network performance,WT-Y Hsu; P-C Yew,A unified approach; incorporating architectural and packaging issues; is necessary in thedesign of high performance computer networks. Clustering enables the authors to exploit thephysical hierarchy imposed by packaging. Previously the authors examined the clustering ofhypercube networks within the context of wiring constraints (see 1991 Int. Conf. on ParallelProcessing; Aug. 1991). The authors extend their earlier work to compare the performanceof hypercubes and meshes. They consider two cost constraints; bisection width and packagepinout; and examine flat and clustered meshes and hypercubes. They find that the relativeperformance of networks depends on the chosen wiring constraint; as well as systemconfiguration and message granularity.,Parallel Processing Symposium; 1992.

Transformed Representations for Convolutional Neural Networks in Diabetic Retinopathy Screening.,Gilbert Lim; Mong-Li Lee; Wynne Hsu; Tien Yin Wong,Abstract Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are flexible; biologically-inspired variants ofmulti-layer perceptrons that have proven themselves to be exceptionally suited todiscriminative vision tasks. However; relatively little is known on whether they can be madeboth more efficient and more accurate; by introducing suitable transformations that exploitgeneral knowledge of the target classes. We demonstrate this functionality through pre-segmentation of input images with a fast and robust but loose segmentation step; to obtain aset of candidate objects. These objects then undergo a spatial transformation into a reducedspace; retaining but a compact high-level representation of their appearance. Additionalattributes may be abstracted as raw features that are incorporated after the convolutionalphase of the network. Finally; we compare its performance against existing approaches …,AAAI Workshop: Modern Artificial Intelligence for Health Analytics,2014,14

Incorporating duration information for trajectory classification,Dhaval Patel; Chang Sheng; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Trajectory classification has many useful applications. Existing works on trajectoryclassification do not consider the duration information of trajectory. In this paper; we extractduration-aware features from trajectories to build a classifier. Our method utilizes informationtheory to obtain regions where the trajectories have similar speeds and directions. Further;trajectories are summarized into a network based on the MDL principle that takes intoaccount the duration difference among trajectories of different classes. A graph traversal isperformed on this trajectory network to obtain the top-k covering path rules for eachtrajectory. Based on the discovered regions and top-k path rules; we build a classifier topredict the class labels of new trajectories.

A path-based labeling scheme for efficient structural join,Hanyu Li; Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu,Abstract The structural join has become a core operation in XML query processing. Thiswork examines how path information in XML can be utilized to speed up the structural joinoperation. We introduce a novel approach to pre-filter path expressions and identify aminimal set of candidate elements for the structural join. The proposed solution comprises ofa path-based node labeling scheme and a path join algorithm. The former associates everynode in an XML document with its path type; while the latter greatly reduces the cost ofsubsequent element node join by filtering out elements with irrelevant path types.Comparative experiments with the state-of-the-art holistic join algorithm clearly demonstratethat the proposed approach is efficient and scalable for queries ranging from simple paths tocomplex branch queries.,International XML Database Symposium,2005,14
Entity profiling with varying source reliabilities,Furong Li; Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu,Abstract The rapid growth of information sources on the Web has intensified the problem ofdata quality. In particular; the same real world entity may be described by different sources invarious ways with overlapping information; and possibly conflicting or even erroneousvalues. In order to obtain a more complete and accurate picture for a real world entity; weneed to collate the data records that refer to the entity; as well as correct any erroneousvalues. We observe that these two tasks are often tightly coupled: rectifying erroneousvalues will facilitate data collation; while linking similar records provides us with a clearerview of the data and additional evidence for error correction. In this paper; we present aframework called Comet that interleaves record linkage with error correction; taking intoconsideration the source reliabilities on various attributes.

Positive borders or negative borders: How to make lossless generator based representations concise,Guimei Liu; Jinyan Li; Limsoon Wong; Wynne Hsu,Abstract A complete set of frequent itemsets can get undesirably large due to redundancy.Several representations have been proposed to eliminate the redundancy. Existinggenerator based representations rely on a negative border to make the representationlossless. However; negative borders of generators are often very large. The number ofitemsets on a negative border sometimes even exceeds the total number of frequentitemsets. In this paper; we propose to use a positive border together with frequentgenerators to form a lossless representation. A set of frequent generators plus its positiveborder is always no larger than the corresponding complete set of frequent itemsets; thus itis a true concise representation. The generalized form of this representation is alsoproposed. We develop an efficient algorithm; called GrGrowth; to mine generators and …,*,2006,13
Efficient mining of dense periodic patterns in time series,Chang SHENG; Wynne HSU; Mong Li LEE,Existing techniques to mine periodic patterns in time series data are focused on discoveringfull-cycle periodic patterns from an entire time series. However; many useful partial periodicpatterns are hidden in long and complex time series data. In this paper; we aim to discoverthe partial periodicity in local segments of the time series data. We introduce the notion ofcharacter density to partition the time series into variable-length fragments and to determinethe lower bound of each character's period. We propose a novel algorithm; called DPMiner;to. nd the dense periodic patterns in time series data. The algorithm makes use of an Apriori-like property to prune the search space. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-lifedatasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective and ef. cient to revealinteresting dense periodic patterns.,*,2005,13

Fuzzy application in tolerance design,Wynne Hsu; CSG Lee,Tolerance design has always been a challenge to the designer. On the one hand; tighttolerances often imply good quality. On the other hand; the tighter the tolerancespecification; the higher the cost of production. To achieve a proper balance between thetwo is not an easy matter. In this paper the authors examine a means of balancing these twoconflicting requirements. A new tolerance representation based on fuzzy arithmetic hasbeen proposed to allow for more intuitive and natural way of expressing relationshipsbetween different parts. With this representation; relative assembly tolerance constraints canbe easily expressed. An assembly-driven fuzzy tolerance generation and assignmentprocess is discussed. During the generation phase; fuzzy tolerance conditions areautomatically generated through a feedback evaluation process. In addition …,Fuzzy Systems; 1994.

Therefore;there is a pressing need for cost-effective screening; such that preventive measures can betaken. This can be achieved with an accurate segmentation of the optic disc and cup fromretinal images to obtain the cup-to-disc ratio.

Integrating frequent pattern mining from multiple data domains for classification,Dhaval Patel; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Many frequent pattern mining algorithms have been developed for categorical; numerical;time series; or interval data. However; little attention has been given to integrate thesealgorithms so as to mine frequent patterns from multiple domain datasets for classification. Inthis paper; we introduce the notion of a heterogenous pattern to capture the associationsamong different kinds of data. We propose a unified framework for mining multiple domaindatasets and design an iterative algorithm called HTMiner. HTMiner discovers essentialheterogenous patterns for classification and performs instance elimination. This instanceelimination step reduces the problem size progressively by removing training instanceswhich are correctly covered by the discovered essential heterogenous pattern.

Efficient evaluation of multiple queries on streaming XML data,Mong Li Lee; Boon Chin Chua; Wynne Hsu; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Traditionally; XML documents are processed at where they are stored. This allowsthe query processor to exploit pre-computed data structures (eg; index) to retrieve thedesired data efficiently. However; this mode of processing is not suitable for manyapplications where the documents are frequently updated. In such situations; efficientevaluation of multiple queries over streaming XML documents becomes important. Thispaper introduces a new operator; mqX-scan; which efficiently evaluates multiple querieswith a single pass on streaming XML data.

Tagcloud-based explanation with feedback for recommender systems,Wei Chen; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Abstract Personalized recommender systems aim to push only the relevant items andinformation directly to the users without requiring them to browse through millions of webresources. The challenge of these systems is to achieve a high user acceptance rate on theirrecommendations. In this paper; we aim to increase the user acceptance ofrecommendations by providing more intuitive tag-based explanations of why the items arerecommended. Tags are used as intermediary entities that not only relate target users to therecommended items but also understand users' intents. Our system also allows tag-basedonline relevance feedback. Experiment results on the Movielens dataset show that theproposed approach is able to increase the acceptance rate of recommendations andimprove user satisfaction.,Proceedings of the 36th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2013,9
Segmentation of retinal vessels using nonlinear projections,Yongping Zhang; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,An automated method for blood vessel segmentation is presented in this paper. Theapproach uses the nonlinear orthogonal projection to capture the features of vesselnetworks; and derives a novel local adaptive thresholding algorithm for vessel detection. Byembedding in a kind of image decomposition model; the selection of system parameterwhich reflects the size of concerned convex set is examined. This approach differs frompreviously known methods in that it uses matched filtering; vessel tracking or supervisedmethods. The algorithm was tested on two publicly available databases: the DRIVE and theSTARE. By comparison with hand-labeled ground truth; good average accuracies areachieved for the both databases.,Image Processing; 2007. ICIP 2007. IEEE International Conference on,2007,9
Node immunization over infectious period,Chonggang Song; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Abstract Locating nodes to immunize in computer/social networks to control the spread ofvirus or rumors has become an important problem. In real world contagions; nodes may getinfected by external sources when the propagation is underway. While most studiesformalize the problem in a setting where contagion starts at one time point; we model a morerealistic situation where there are likely to be many breakouts of contagions over a timewindow. We call this the node immunization over infectious period (NIIP) problem. We showthat the NIIP problem is NP-hard and remains so even in directed acyclic graphs. Wepropose a NIIP algorithm to select $ k $ nodes to immunize over a time period. Simulation isperformed to estimate a good distribution of $ k $ over the time period. For each time point;the NIIP algorithm will make decisions which nodes to immunize given the estimated …,Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2015,8
Utilizing purchase intervals in latent clusters for product recommendation,Gang Zhao; Mong LI Lee; Hsu Wynne,Abstract Collaborative filtering have become increasingly important with the development ofWeb 2.0. Online shopping service providers aim to provide users with quality list ofrecommended items that will enhance user satisfaction and loyalty. Matrix factorizationapproaches have become the dominant method as they can reduce the dimension of thedata set and alleviate the sparsity problem. However; matrix factorization approaches arelimited because they depict each user as one preference vector. In practice; we observe thatusers may have different preferences when purchasing different subsets of items; and theperiods between purchases also vary from one user to another. In this work; we propose aprobabilistic approach to learn latent clusters in the large user-item matrix; and incorporatetemporal information into the recommendation process.

Coordination guided reinforcement learning,Qiangfeng Peter Lau; Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu,Abstract In this paper; we propose to guide reinforcement learning (RL) with expertcoordination knowledge for multi-agent problems managed by a central controller. The aimis to learn to use expert coordination knowledge to restrict the joint action space and to directexploration towards more promising states; thereby improving the overall learning rate. Wemodel such coordination knowledge as constraints and propose a two-level RL system thatutilizes these constraints for online applications. Our declarative approach towardsspecifying coordination in multi-agent learning allows knowledge sharing betweenconstraints and features (basis functions) for function approximation. Results on a soccergame and a tactical real-time strategy game show that coordination constraints improve thelearning rate compared to using only unary constraints.

Efficient pattern discovery for semistructured data,Zhou Feng; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,The process of discovering frequent patterns from large semistructured data repositories isone of the hardest categories of tree mining problems; since it involves the discovery ofunordered embedded tree patterns. Existing work has focused primarily on the discovery ofordered; induced trees. This work proposes a divide-and-conquer algorithm called WTIMinerto discover the complete set of frequent unordered embedded subtrees. The algorithmsuccessfully reduces the complexity of pattern matching and counting problem that a regulartree mining algorithm faces.

Techniques for temporal registration of retinal images,Bin Fang; Wynne Hsu; Mong-Li Lee,Temporal registration of retinal images is helpful to provide physicians important informationin tracking the evolution of eye-related diseases. The vascular structure of the retina is themost appropriate feature representation for registration. This paper describes a fast chamfermatching applied to the vascular structure to align pairs of fundus images. While the fastchamfer matching is able to achieve successful alignment consistently; it fails to find correctmodel parameters in a few cases. To alleviate this problem; we propose a nonparametricelastic matching method. The two matching algorithms are tested on 98 pairs of temporalfundus images. We found that elastic matching gives better performance than the fastchamfer matching method where there are 3 failure cases were reported.,Image Processing; 2004.

It is easyto see that there are enormous number of such MHRs in a given instance; and most of thetime; applications require only to nd the\largest" MHR or\su ciently large" MHRs.

Conceptual level design for assembly analysis using state transitional approach,Wynne Hsu; Andrew Lim; CS George Lee,Traditionally; design for assembly is done during the detailed design phase. A designer firstmaps a set of design requirements into a set of components or subassemblies that cansatisfy the given set of requirements. The components and subassemblies are thenexamined individually to determine whether they conform to the principles of design forassembly. Usually; local changes are performed so that the resultant components/subassemblies are better for assembly. In this paper; we propose to bring the design forassembly analysis into an even earlier phase-that of the conceptual design phase. Weargue that by incorporating the design for assembly analysis at the conceptual designphase; we can achieve a more substantial savings as compared to the savings obtainedwhen the design for assembly analysis is only performed as late as the detailed design …,Robotics and Automation; 1996.

Discovering conforming and unexpected classification rules,Bing Liu; Wynne Hsu; Shu Chen,Abstract One problem in applying machine learning and knowledge discovery techniques tosolve real-world problems is how to incorporate the user's concepts about the applicationdomain into the learning process to discover interesting rules to the user. Rules areinteresting if they are useful and/or provide new knowledge to the user. Interesting rules aresubjective because they depend on the individual user's existing knowledge (concepts orhypotheses) about the domain and his/her interests at a particular point in time. In theapplications of classification rule induction techniques to real-world problems; we encountera number of problems regarding the production of interesting knowledge to the user.

Automatic generation of goal regions for assembly tasks in the presence of uncertainty,Shun-Feng Su; CS George Lee; Wynne Hsu,This paper presents a systematic procedure for generating the goal region of a mating actionfrom a model of assemblies. The goal region of a mating action is defined as the acceptabledestination of the moving object and is used to identify the successful situation of the matingaction. In this paper; goal regions are constructed by using the mating features and theconstraint types residing in the model of assemblies. The mating features identify theimportant variables between which the interdependencies are considered; and theconstraint types identify the necessary constraints that mating features cannot provide. Ananalytical solution for C-space interior is developed to construct the goal region from 2Dfeatures. The effects of interference and fine-motion planning on success probabilities arealso taken into consideration to define theoretical goal regions; goal regions are also …,IEEE transactions on robotics and automation,1996,7
Prediction of cerebral aneurysm rupture,Qiangfeng Peter Lau; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee; Ying Mao; Liang Chen,Cerebral aneurysms are weak or thin spots on blood vessels in the brain that balloon out.While the majority of aneurysms do not burst; those that do would lead to seriouscomplications including hemorrhagic stroke; permanent nerve damage; or death. Yet;surgical options for treating cerebral aneurysms carry high risk to the patient. It is vital for thedoctors to accurately diagnose aneurysms that have high probabilities of rupturing. In thisapplication; the patient dataset has many attributes; ranging from patient profile to resultsfrom diagnostic test and features extracted from brain images. Many of the attributes arediscrete and have missing values. The dataset is also highly biased; with 15% unrupturecases and 85% rupture cases.

Identification of microrna precursors via svm,Liang Huai Yang; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee; Limsoon Wong,Abstract MiRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression. While the firstmiRNAs were discovered using experimental methods; experimental miRNA identificationremains technically challenging and incomplete. This calls for the development ofcomputational approaches to complement experimental approaches to miRNA geneidentification. We propose in this paper a de novo miRNA precursor prediction method.

Enhancing SNNB with local accuracy estimation and ensemble techniques,Zhipeng Xie; Qing Zhang; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Abstract Naïve Bayes; the simplest Bayesian classifier; has shown excellent performancegiven its unrealistic independence assumption. This paper studies the selectiveneighborhood-based naïve Bayes (SNNB) for lazy classification; and develops three variantalgorithms; SNNB-G; SNNB-L; and SNNB-LV; all with linear computational complexity. TheSNNB algorithms use local learning strategy for alleviating the independence assumption.The underlying idea is; for a test example; first to construct multiple classifiers on its multipleneighborhoods with different radius; and then to select out the classifier with the highestestimated accuracy to make decision. Empirical results show that both SNNB-L and SNNB-LV generate more accurate classifiers than naïve Bayes and several other state-of-the-artclassification algorithms including C4. 5; Naïve Bayes Tree; and Lazy Bayesian Rule.

Distributed coordination guidance in multi-agent reinforcement learning,Qiangfeng Peter Lau; Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu,In this paper we present a distributed reinforcement learning system that leverages onexpert coordination knowledge to improve learning in multi-agent problems. We focus on thescenario where agents can communicate with their neighbors but this communicationstructure and the number of agents may change over time. We express coordinationknowledge as constraints to reduce the joint action space for exploration. We introduce anextra learning level to learn when to make use of these constraints. This extra level isdecentralized among the agents; making it suitable for our communication restrictions.Experiment results on tactical real-time strategy and soccer games show that our system iseffective in online learning as opposed to existing methods that use individual constraints onagents and coordinated action selection.,Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI); 2011 23rd IEEE International Conference on,2011,5

A histogram-based selectivity estimator for skewed XML data,Hanyu Li; Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu,Abstract The optimization of XML queries requires an accurate and compact structure tocapture the characteristics of the underlying data. A compact structure works well when thedata is uniformly distributed and has many common paths. However; more detailedinformation needs to be maintained when the data is skewed. This work presents ahistogram-based structure to capture the distribution of skewed XML data. It builds upon astatistical method to estimate the result size of XML queries.

This problem is aggravated when multiple data sources need to beintegrated. Data cleaning refers to a series of processes employed to deal with detectingand removing errors and inconsistencies from data. Given the" garbage in; garbage out"principle; clean data is crucial for database integration; data warehousing and data mining.Data cleaning is a necessary step prior to the knowledge discovery process.

Yet; ifwe examine this value in conjunction with other attribute values; the value appearquestionable. Detecting such dubious values is a major problem in data cleaning. Thispaper presents a framework to automatically detect dubious data values in the datasets.Data is first pre-processed by data smoothing and mapping. Next; interval association rulesare generated which involved data partitioning via clustering before the rules are generatedusing an Apriori algorithm. Finally; these rules are used to identify data values that falloutside the expected intervals.

Twins: A practical vision-based 3D mouse,Sifang Li; Wynne Hsu; Hung Keng Pung,Abstract A novel scheme is introduced that uses a mirror and a single camera to restore the3D position of a finger tip. The camera is positioned in such a way that it captures both thehand as well as its mirror image. The captured images are then processed to extract thecontour of the hand. This extraction process is done using a fast algorithm that integratesBayesian estimation in the traditional chain code generation algorithm. The algorithm workswell with a complex; albeit fixed; background. In addition; we have integrated thesmoothness assumption into the algorithm so as to obtain a smoother hand contour; thusimproving the accuracy of our tracking process.

Tuple-Level Analysis for Identification of Interesting Rules,Bing Liu; Wynne Hsu; Hing-yan Lee; Lai-fun Mun,Abstract One of the important issues in data mining is the “interestingness” problem. Pastresearch and applications have shown that in many situations a huge number of patternscan be discovered from a database. Most of these patterns are actually useless oruninteresting to the user. But because of the huge number of patterns; it is difficult for theuser to identify those interesting to him/her. In this project; we propose a new technique tohelp the user identify interesting patterns. The user is first asked to provide his/her expectedpatterns according to his/her past knowledge and/or intuitive feelings. Given theseexpectations; the system uses a tuple-level fuzzy matching technique to analyze and rankthe discovered patterns according to a number of interestingness measures. With thistechnique; the user can quickly focus on a subset of the discovered patterns with the most …,SoC.; National University of Singapore,1996,5
Temporal influence blocking: Minimizing the effect of misinformation in social networks,Chonggang Song; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,The diffusion of rumors is a major concern for web users. Limiting the spread of rumor onsocial networks has become an important task. One approach is to identify nodes to start atruth campaign such that when users are aware of the truth; they would not believe orpropagate the rumor. However; existing works do not take into account the delays ofinformation diffusion or the time point beyond which propagation of misinformation is nolonger critical.

Similar subsequence search in time series databases,Shrikant Kashyap; Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu,Abstract Finding matching subsequences in time series data is an important problem. Theclassical approach to search for matching subsequences has been on the principle ofexhaustive search; where all possible candidates are generated and evaluated or all theterms of the time series in a data base are examined. As a result most of the subsequencesearch algorithms are cubic in nature with few algorithms of quadratic nature. Someapproximate algorithms have been proposed; as a result; to speed up the search formatching subsequences. In this work; we propose a fast and efficient exact subsequencesearch algorithm which is sub-quadratic in nature.

On the detection of retinal vessels in fundus images,Bin Fang; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Ocular fundus image can provide information on pathological changes caused by localocular diseases and early signs of certain systemic diseases. Automated analysis andinterpretation of fundus images has become a necessary and important diagnosticprocedure in ophthalmology. Among the features in ocular fundus image are the optic disc;fovea (central vision area); lesions; and retinal vessels. These features are useful inrevealing the states of diseases in the form of measurable abnormalities such as length ofdiameter; change in color; and degree of tortuosity in the vessels. In addition; retinal vesselscan also serve as landmarks for image-guided laser treatment of choroidalneovascularization. Thus; reliable methods for blood vessel detection that preserve variousvessel measurements are needed. In this paper; we will examine the pathological issues …,*,2003,4
Identifying Interesting Missing Patterns,Bing Liu; Wynne Hsu; Lai-Fun Mun; Hing-Yan Lee,Abstract One of the important issues in data mining is the subjective “interestingness”problem. It has been shown that in many situations a huge number of patterns can bediscovered from a database. Most of these patterns are actually useless or uninteresting tothe user. But because of the huge number of patterns; it is difficult for the user to identifythose patterns that are of interest to him/her. Past research proposed two main measures ofsubjective interestingness: unexpectedness and actionability. Both these measures focus onhelping the user identify interesting discovered patterns. In this paper; we show that missingpatterns (absence of some patterns) are interesting too. An approach has been proposed toidentify the interesting missing patterns. The proposed approach is an extension of ourprevious work. In our previous work; we studied the subjective interestingness problem …,*,1997,4
Tuple-level analysis for identification of interesting patterns,LIU Bing; HSU Wynne; LEE Hing-Yan; MUN Lai-Fun,One of the important issues in data mining is the" interestingness" problem. Past researchand applications have shown that in many situations a huge number of patterns can bediscovered from a database. Most of these patterns are actually useless or uninteresting tothe user. But because of the huge number of patterns; it is difficult for the user to identifythose interesting to him/her. In this project; we propose a new technique to help the useridentify interesting patterns. The user is first asked to provide his/her expected patternsaccording to his/her past knowledge and/or intuitive feelings. Given these expectations; thesystem uses a tuple-level fuzzy matching technique to analyze and rank the discoveredpatterns according to a number of interestingness measures. With this technique; the usercan quickly focus on a subset of the discovered patterns with the most application values.,*,1996,4

An incremental feature extraction framework for referable diabetic retinopathy detection,Jay Nandy; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Diabetic retinopathy (DR) might be characterized by the occurrence of lesions in the retinalimage. Existing approaches require a large set of retinal images where lesions in the imageare individually annotated to learn a model that will classify an image as referable or non-referable DR. However; annotating individual lesions is a tedious task and the accuracy ofthe learnt model is limited by the availability of these annotated images. In this paper; we firstlearn a universal Gaussian mixture model (GMM) from a small set of annotated images. Thisuniversal GMM is then applied as the prior belief to learn an adaptive GMM for individualimages. The proposed approach aims to capture the characteristics of referable versus non-referable images by examining the difference between the universal GMM and the adaptiveGMM. An image-level classifier is then built based on these differences as features …,Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI); 2016 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2016,3
Mining brokers in dynamic social networks,Chonggang Song; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Abstract The theory of brokerage in sociology suggests if contacts between two parties areenabled through a third party; the latter occupies a strategic position of controllinginformation flows. Such individuals are called brokers and they play a key role indisseminating information. However; there is no systematic approach to identify brokers inonline social networks. In this paper; we formally define the problem of detecting top-$ k $brokers given a social network and show that it is NP-hard. We develop a heuristic algorithmto find these brokers based on the weak tie theory. In order to handle the dynamic nature ofonline social networks; we design incremental algorithms: WeakTie-Local for unidirectionalnetworks and WeakTie-Bi for bidirectional networks. We use two real world datasets; DBLPand Twitter; to evaluate the proposed methods.

Distributed relational temporal difference learning,Qiangfeng Peter Lau; Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu,Abstract Relational representations have great potential for rapidly generalizing learnedknowledge in large Markov decision processes such as multi-agent problems. In this work;we introduce relational temporal difference learning for the distributed case where thecommunication links among agents are dynamic. Thus no critical components of the systemshould reside in any one agent. Relational generalization among agents' learning isachieved through the use of partially bound relational features and a message passingscheme. We further describe how the proposed concepts can be applied to distributedreinforcement learning methods that use value functions. Experiments were conducted onsoccer and real-time strategy game domains with dynamic communication.

Utilizing users' tipping points in E-commerce Recommender systems,Kailun Hu; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Existing recommendation algorithms assume that users make their purchase decisionssolely based on individual preferences; without regard to the type of users nor the products'maturity stages. Yet; extensive studies have shown that there are two types of users:innovators and imitators. Innovators tend to make purchase decisions based solely on theirown preferences; whereas imitators' purchase decisions are often influenced by a product'sstage of maturity. In this paper; we propose a framework that seamlessly incorporates thetype of user and product maturity into existing recommendation algorithms. We apply Bassmodel to classify each user as either an innovator or imitator according to his/her previouspurchase behavior. In addition; we introduce the concept of tipping point of a user.

Mining in Spatiotemporal Databases.,Junmei Wang; Wynne Hsu; Mong-Li Lee,Abstract Recent interest in spatio-temporal applications has been fueled by the need todiscover and predict complex patterns that occur when we observe the behavior of objects inthe three-dimensional space of time and spatial coordinates. Although the complex andintrinsic relationships among the spatio-temporal data limit the usefulness of conventionaldata mining techniques to discover the patterns in the spatio-temporal databases; they alsolead to opportunities for mining new classes of patterns in spatiotemporal databases. Thischapter provides a survey of the work done for mining patterns in spatial databases andtemporal databases; and the preliminary work for mining patterns in spatio-temporaldatabases. We highlight the unique challenges of mining interesting patterns inspatiotemporal databases. We also describe two special types of spatio-temporal patterns …,*,2005,3
Mode committee: A novel ensemble method by clustering and local learning,Zhipeng Xie; Wynne Hsu; M Li Lee,Ensemble methods have proved effective to achieve higher accuracy. Some simpleensemble methods; such as Bagging; work well with unstable base algorithms; but fail withstable ones. The reason is that such methods achieve higher accuracy by reducing only thevariance of the base algorithms. It does not touch the bias. Here; we propose a novelensemble method; mode committee; intended to work for both stable and unstable basealgorithms. It first derive a new algorithm; called mode competitor; from given basealgorithm; with the help of k-modes clustering method and the local learning strategy.Randomness is injected into each mode competitor by the process of random seeding. Theaim of deriving mode competitor is to reduce the bias with the possible increasing variance.Then; multiple mode competitors form a committee and vote on the decision of new …,Tools with Artificial Intelligence; 2004.

Approximate counting of frequent query patterns over XQuery stream,Liang Huai Yang; Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu,Abstract One efficient approach to improve the performance of XML management systems isto cache the frequently retrieved results. This entails the discovery of frequent query patternsthat are issued by users. In this paper; we model user queries as a stream of XML querypattern trees and mine for frequent query patterns in a batch-wise manner. We design anovel data structure called D-GQPT to merge the pattern trees of the batches seen so far;and to dynamically mark the active portion of the current batch. With the D-GQPT; we areable to limit the enumeration of candidate trees to only the currently active pattern trees. Wealso design a summary data structure called ECTree to incrementally compute the frequenttree patterns over the query stream.

Profiling entities over time in the presence of unreliable sources,Furong Li; Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu,To harness the rich amount of information available on the web today; many organizationsaggregate public (and private) data to derive knowledge repositories for real-world entities.This paper aims to build historical profiles of real-world entities by integrating temporalrecords collected from different sources. This problem is challenging not only becauseentities may change their attribute values over time; but also because information providedby the sources could be unreliable. In this paper; we present a new solution for profilingentities over time. To understand the evolution of entities; we describe a novel transitionmodel which gives the probability that an entity will change to a particular attribute valueafter some time period. Next; a set of quality metrics are defined for the data sources tocapture the exactness and timeliness of their provided values.

k-Consistent influencers in network data,Enliang Xu; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee; Dhaval Patel,Abstract With the prevalence of online social media such as Facebook; Twitter andYouTube; social influence analysis has attracted considerable research interests recently.Existing works on top-k influential nodes discovery find influential users at single time pointonly and do not capture whether the users are consistently influential over a period of time.Finding top-k consistent influencers has many interesting applications; such as targetedmarketing; recommendation; experts finding; and stock market. Identifying top-k consistentinfluencers is a challenging task. First; we need to dynamically compute the total influence ofeach user at each time point from an action log. However; to find the consistent top-scorers;we need to sort and rank them at each time point. This is computationally expensive and notscalable.

Incremental mining of top-k maximal influential paths in network data,Enliang Xu; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee; Dhaval Patel,Abstract Information diffusion refers to the spread of abstract ideas and concepts; technicalinformation; and actual practices within a social system; where the spread denotes flow ormovement from a source to an adopter; typically via communication and influence.Discovering influence relations among users has important applications in viral marketing;personalized recommendations and feed ranking in social networks. Existing works oninformation diffusion analysis have focused on discovering “influential users” and “whoinfluences whom” relationships using data obtained from social networks. However; they donot consider the continuity of influence among users. In this paper; we develop a method forinferring top-k maximal influential paths which can capture the continuity of influence.

Current methodsdetermine data discrepancies by assessing whether the data conforms to the expecteddistribution of its immediate neighborhood. This approach may miss interesting deviationsinvolving aggregated information. For example; the average number of transactions of aparticular bank account may be exceptionally high as compared to other accounts withsimilar profiles. Such incongruity could only be revealed through aggregating appropriatedata and analyzing the aggregated results in the associated neighborhood.

Mining prevalence-based ratio patterns,Minghua Zhang; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Association rule mining aims to discover sets of features that occur together. A variation ofassociation rule mining is ratio rule mining. A ratio rule is an eigenvector of the database thatdescribes ratios of features. However; ratio rules are sensitive to outliers. In this work; wedesign a prevalence-based model for mining ratio patterns from a database. Our model ismore robust to noises; and ratio patterns in our model have clear statistic meanings. Wedevelop an algorithm to quickly determine the sets of features and their ratios that satisfy theprevalence requirement.

An approximation to mean-shift via swarm intelligence,Mani Thomas; Chandra Kambhamettu,Mean shift based feature space analysis has been shown to be an elegant; accurate androbust technique. The elegance in this non-parametric algorithm is mainly due to itssimplicity in performing gradient ascent to estimate the modes in a multidimensional data.One characteristic aspect of mean shift is that the mode estimation is performed at each datapoint. Since it is important to describe the data in as succinct manner as possible; it isimportant to focus on modal points in the data instead of every data point. In this paper; weattempt to tackle the mean shift problem through a" mode centric" approach using swarmintelligence. Here; the mode estimation is cast as a problem of goal seeking for the swarmas it moves through the multidimensional data space.

Rewriting queries for XML integration systems,Ling Li; Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu,Abstract A data integration system typically creates a target XML schema to represent anapplication domain and source schemas are mapped to the target schema. A user poses aquery over the target schema; and the system rewrites the query into a set of queries overthe data sources. Existing algorithms generate a set of static rules based on the targetschema and mappings; and rewrite the target query using these rules. We design a flexibleand dynamic approach that rewrites XML queries directly based on the mappings betweenthe target and source schemas.

Generalization of classification rules,Zhipeng Xie; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Traditional classification rules are in the form of production rules. Recent works in hybridclassification algorithms have proposed the generation of contextual rules; whereby the right-hand side of the production rule is replaced by a classifier; to achieve higher accuracy. Inthis work; we present a framework to further generalize classification rules such that the left-hand side of a production rule is expressed as a conjunction of classifiers; called spacesplitters. An intelligent divide-and-conquer approach is designed to construct suchgeneralized classification rules. The construction algorithm; GCTree; is elegant; efficient andscalable. The resulting classifier is able to achieve high predictive accuracy that outperformsnaive Bayes and C4. 5. Experiments demonstrate that GCTree is compact and stable.,Tools with Artificial Intelligence; 2003. Proceedings. 15th IEEE International Conference on,2003,2
Domain knowledge to support the discovery process: user preferences,Bing Liu; Wynne Hsu,Abstract The goal of data mining is to discover useful knowledge (or rules) for the user. Pastresearch has produced many efficient techniques for rule discovery from databases.However; these techniques often generate too many rules; which makes it very difficult forthe user to analyze them in order to find those truly interesting/useful rules. In this article; wefirst discuss some issues involved in assisting the user to analyze the discovered rules. Wethen review a number of existing techniques that employ the user's preferences andknowledge about the domain to identify those potentially interesting/useful rules for the user.,Handbook of data mining and knowledge discovery,2002,2
Quantifying aspect bias in ordinal ratings using a bayesian approach,Lahari Poddar; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Abstract: Opinion of users expressed in the form of observed ratings can influence anindividual's view of an item. However; the true quality of an item is often obfuscated by userbiases; and it is not obvious from the observed ratings the importance users place ondifferent aspects of an item. In this paper; we propose a probabilistic modeling of theobserved aspect ratings to infer (i) each user's aspect bias and (ii) latent intrinsic quality ofan item. We model multi-aspect ratings as ordered discrete data and encode thedependency between different aspects by using a latent Gaussian structure. We handle theGaussian-Categorical non-conjugacy using a stick-breaking formulation coupled withrecently developed Polya-Gamma auxiliary variable augmentation for a simple; fullyBayesian inference.

LinkNet: capturing temporal dependencies among spatial regions,Dhaval Patel; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Abstract Many applications require understanding how event occurrences at onegeographical region affect or influence event occurrences at another region; eg spread ofdisease and forest fires. Existing works typically impose a grid to partition the spatial spaceand utilize spatial autocorrelation property to model the spatial dependency among the gridcells. However; they are often highly sensitive to the granularity of the grid size and they donot incorporate the temporal dynamics of the event occurrences among regions. This paperutilizes the notion of a spatial network with temporal dependency to capture the dynamics ofevent occurrences among regions. This network is modeled as a directed graph where eachnode is a group of spatially nearby events and each directed edge represents the influenceof events from a source node to a destination node.

We adopt the pattern growth approach and develop an algorithm calledGenSTMiner to discover these patterns. In order to increase the efficiency of the miningprocess; we also present two optimization techniques. The first is the use of conditionalprojected databases to prune infeasible events and sequences; and the second is pseudoprojection to reduce memory requirement.,*,2008,1

Domain knowledge to support the discovery process: previously discovered knowledge,Bing Liu; Wynne Hsu,Abstract In this article; we discuss how previously discovered knowledge can be used infuture knowledge-discovery processes. This is an important topic as in real-life environmentsdata collected in databases change; and patterns mined in the past may no longer be valid.In such situations; the users always want to know what data and patterns have changed andhow they have changed. The ability to mine interesting knowledge and/or changes based onpreviously discovered knowledge is crucial.

Approximating scheduling for multimedia applications under overload conditions,Teik Guan Tan; Wynne Hsu,Abstract With the increased demands in multimedia applications; the need to provide bettersystem support is greater than ever. Multimedia applications have an added dimension oftime in their execution which results in stringent timing requirements. These timingrequirements are usually “soft” constraints; that is; they are potentially relaxable humanpreference constraints. In this paper; we investigate an approximating scheduling algorithmthat attempts to derive a “good” schedule for multimedia processes even under the overloadcondition. A model is presented which is able to quantify the trade-off between conflictinggoals in a multimedia application. Experiments are conducted to test the performance of theapproximating scheduling algorithm. Results indicate that our proposed algorithm is able toadjust dynamically to transient overload situation without too much degradation in …,International journal of approximate reasoning,1998,1
A computer-aided product redesign system for robotic assembly,Wynne Hsu; CSG Lee; Andrew Lim,Abstract It is an established fact that a majority of a product's cost is determined by its design.Hence; effort should be directed to achieve a lower cost design without sacrificing theoriginal functionality. A computer-aided product redesign system is proposed to provide helpin generating assembly-oriented redesign by taking the robotic assembly constraints intoconsideration. The system operates in two phases: In the first phase; an objective evaluationof the input design is performed to determine whether there is a need for redesign. Duringthe second phase; the focus is to aid the designer in searching for feasible designalternatives. Three quantitative measures have been proposed to evaluate the conformity ofan input design to a list of DFA design guidelines. If the input design received a badevaluation results on any of the three measures; a search for feasible redesign …,Robotica,1998,1
Post-Analysis of,Bing Liu; Wynne Hsu,Abstract Rule induction research implicitly assumes that after producing the rules from adataset; these rules will be used directly by an expert system or a human user. In real-lifeapplications; the situation may not be as simple as that; particularly; when the user of therules is a human being. The human user almost always has some previous concepts orknowledge about the domain represented by the data&. Naturally; he/she wishes to knowhow the new rules compare with his/her existing knowledge. Ill dynamic domains where therules may change over time; it is important to know what the changes are. These aspects ofresearch have largely been ignored in the past. With the increasing use of machine learningtechniques in practica1 applications such as data mining; this issue of post analysis of ruleswarrants greater emphasis and attention.

Paradigm shift and the integrated feedback approach,Wynne Hsu; CS George Lee,With the increased competition in today's world market; emphasis has been on the ability toshift from an existing paradigm to a new paradigm so as to create new opportunities and togain new market. A successful paradigm shift is dependent on two factors:(1) the ability topinpoint the inherent weaknesses in the existing paradigm;(2) the ability to find a paradigmthat can replace the old paradigm. In this paper; we show how the integrated feedbackapproach is able to address these two concerns. The integrated feedback approach wasproposed to integrate the design phase with the downstream activities so as to achieve adesign that is better for assembly. The approach operates in two phases: an evaluationphase and a redesign suggestion generation phase. A number of objective criteria havebeen proposed to evaluate a given design from the functional perspective; from the …,Robotics and Automation; 1995.

Predicting User Reported Drug Side Effects Using a Gated Neural Network,Lahari Poddar; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,ABSTRACT The detection of Adverse Drug Events (ADE) or side effects of different drugsare necessary to minimize potential health risks of patients. Given the prevalence of userreported contents on Twitter and various health forums; recent research has focused on theautomatic discovery of potential side effects of drugs from these online platforms. However; itis not clear if these reported side effects are solely due to the drug or there are otherconfounding factors that influence a patient's experience of side effects. In this work; we seekto characterize the reported side effects along with their severity for different drugs; based onpatients' past drug evaluations and pre-existing medical conditions.

iFACT: An Interactive Framework to Assess Claims from Tweets,Wee Yong Lim; Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu,Abstract Posts by users on microblogs such as Twitter provide diverse real-time updates tomajor events. Unfortunately; not all the information are credible. Previous works that assessthe credibility of information in Twitter have focused on extracting features from the Tweets.In this work; we present an interactive framework called iFACT for assessing the credibility ofclaims from tweets. The proposed framework collects independent evidence from websearch results (WSR) and identify the dependencies between claims. It utilizes features fromthe search results to determine the probabilities that a claim is credible; not credible orinconclusive. Finally; the dependencies between claims are used to adjust the likelihoodestimates of a claim being credible; not credible or inconclusive. iFACT allows users to beengaged in the credibility assessment process by providing feedback as to whether the …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,*

Target-Oriented Keyword Search over Temporal Databases,Xianyan Jia; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,Abstract Keyword search in relational databases has gained popularity due to its ease ofuse. However; existing methods do not handle keyword search in temporal databases. Inthis paper; we extend keyword queries to allow temporal information to be associated withkeywords; as well as support temporal relationships between two keywords. We design atarget-oriented search over an augmented data graph to efficiently evaluate such temporalkeyword queries.

Inferring Topic-Level Influence from Network Data,Enliang Xu; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee; Dhaval Patel,Abstract Existing influence analysis research has largely focused on studying themaximization of influence spread in the whole network; or inferring the “hidden” networkfrom a list of observations. There is little work on topic-level specific influence analysis.Although some works try to address this problem; their methods depend on known socialnetwork structure; and do not consider temporal factor which plays an important role indetermining the degree of influence. In this paper; we take into account the temporal factor toinfer the influential strength between users at topic-level. Our approach does not require theunderlying network structure to be known. We propose a guided hierarchical LDA approachto automatically identify topics without using any structural information. We then construct thetopic-level influence network incorporating the temporal factor to infer the influential …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2014,*
Study on TBM Launching in Parallel with Small Spacing,Zhan Wang; Xuejin Lv,The launching of a tunnel boring machine (TBM) is very important in the tunnel constructionprocedure; but it also has great risk. Water and slurry may burst into the shield work well inthe case of an inappropriate launching process; resulting in the collapse of the work well.Generally; one work well of a tunnel station is uniquely designed for one TBM. The conditionwhere two tunnels or more share one shield work well is rare. Based on the tunnelconstruction project of metro line 1 in Hangzhou; the special problem of TBM launching fromone work well that had three tunnels in parallel was studied. The minimum spacing betweentunnels was 1.83 m; which was only approximately one-third of the diameter of the tunnel.The most dangerous situation of middle TBM launching was studied; which had greatinfluence on the two existing side tunnels.

Exploiting domain knowledge to improve biological significance of biclusters with key missing genes,Jin Chen; Liping Ji; Wynne Hsu; Kian-Lee Tan; Seung Y Rhee,In an era of increasingly complex biological datasets; one of the key steps in gene functionalanalysis comes from clustering genes based on co-expression. Biclustering algorithms canidentify gene clusters with local co-expressed patterns; which are more likely to definegenes functioning together than global clustering methods. However; these algorithms arenot effective in uncovering gene regulatory networks because the mined biclusters lackgenes that may be critical in the function but may not be co-expressed with the clusteredgenes. In this paper; we introduce a biclustering method called SKeleton Biclustering (SKB);which builds high quality biclusters from microarray data; creates relationships among thebiclustered genes based on Gene Ontology annotations; and identifies genes that aremissing in the biclusters.

Next; based on the summary structure; we designan algorithm; called TopologyMiner; to find the interesting topological patterns in a depth-first manner. The algorithm follows the pattern growth methodology. We also investigate anefficient way to incorporate geographical features in TopologyMiner.,*,2008,*

However; both algorithms are not scalable as theyrequire multiple scans of databases and tend to generate many candidates during themining process. Subsequently; Yan and Han (2002) and Nijssen and Kok (2004) proposedepth-first graph mining approaches called gSpan and Gaston; respectively.

Rapid prototyping with constraints-based scheduling for multimedia applications,Wynne Hsu; Teik Guan Tan,Abstract With the increased demand in multimedia applications; the need to provide bettersystem support is greater than ever. Multimedia applications have an added dimension oftime in their execution which results in stringent timing requirements. Existing systemsincorporate such stringent timing requirements either at the system-level or the application-level. System-level supports are typically operating-system-dependent whereas application-level supports are achieved by building timing controls into the application itself. Thislengthens the application development time and fails to take full advantage of operatingsystem's capabilities. In this paper; we propose a framework that resides between thesystem-level and application-level support.

Towards an optimal degree of design coupling through fuzzy analysis,Wynne Hsu; CS George Lee,Abstract It has long been recognized that we need some fundamental; correct principles andmethodologies to guide decision making in design. One important decision to be made indesign is the determination of the optimal degree of design coupling among thecomponents. Two components are physically coupled together if the design features of bothcomponents have been integrated to form one single physical component. This ability todecide on the optimal degree of design coupling has a direct impact on the number ofcomponents in the final design which; in turns; affects the maintainability; assemblability;testability; and adaptability of the resultant product. Design for assembly guidelines tell us toreduce the number of components in the final design. This implies that we should; as far aspossible; strive for the highest degree of physical integration of parts. This may prove to …,Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems,1999,*
Approximating scheduling for multimedia applications under overload conditions,T Guan Tan; W Hsu,With the increased demands in multimedia applications; the need to provide better systemsupport is greater than ever. Multimedia applications have an added dimension of time intheir execution which results in stringent timing requirements. These timing requirements areusually" soft" constraints; that is; they are potentially relaxable human preference constraints.In this paper; we investigate an approximating scheduling algorithm that attempts to derivea" good" schedule for multimedia processes even under the overload condition. A model ispresented which is able to quantify the trade-off between conflicting goals in a multimediaapplication. Experiments are conducted to test the performance of the approximatingscheduling algorithm. Results indicate that our proposed algorithm is able to adjustdynamically to transient overload situation without too much degradation in performance …,*,1998,*
Interactive scheduling supports for real-time multimedia execution,Teik Guan Tan; Wynne Hsu,With the widespread use of multimedia in industry; there is a need to re-study the underlyingcomputer system structure to better support the execution of multimedia applications.Traditional schedulers found in general-purpose operating systems (GPOS) like UNIXcannot give sufficient and timely service to the multimedia applications. Though there aremany hard real-time systems available; they emphasize predictability and absoluteguarantee of schedules. These should not be the primary concerns for multimediaapplications where missing a deadline is not fatal. To address the special needs ofmultimedia scheduling; the authors have designed and implemented a flexible schedulingtestbed; called ICute (Interactive exeCUTE). The objectives of ICute are:(1) to implement aflexible scheduling mechanism that is able to regulate the execution of multimedia …,Multimedia Computing and Systems' 97.

Upgrading links for performance,Andrew Lim; Yeow-Meng Chee; Wynne Hsu,Abstract The performance of a computer network is commonly measured by the maximumminimum time required to move a certain amount of data between any 2 nodes in thenetwork. Due to the advances in technology; certain links in the network may be upgraded;for instance to optical fibre links; so that better performance can be achieved. In this paper;we study the LINK UPGRADE problem for networks. We first show that the LINK UPGRADEproblem is NP-complete. We also show that; a closely related problem; the MINIMUM COSTLINK UPGRADE problem is NP-complete even if the underlying topology of the network is alinear array. However; for certain classes of networks; the LINK UPGRADE problem can besolved in polynomial time. For general networks; we provide effective heuristics for theabove problems.,Informatica,1996,*
Infantile hemangioendothelioma of the liver,Sang Joon Kim; In One Kim; Kyung Mo Yeon,Abstract Radiological findings of 4 cases of infantile hemangioendothelioma of the liver(IHL) were reviewed; which were surgically proven or diagnosed by the clinical findings andsonographic; CT and angiographic findings. Clinical tirads of IHL are abdominal mass(hepatomegaly); congestive heart failure and cutaneous hemangioma. Characteristically;patients of IHL are under 6 months of age and have frequently multifocal lesions whichregress spontaneously. Sonographic findings were multifocal well defined discrete masses.Echogenicity was variable; hypoechoic or hyperechoic with or without centrat target. CT wasperformed in 2 cases and showed multiple centripetally enhancing masses and so it couldbe diagnosed as IHL; and after that it was cnfirmed by angiography. CT of the otherexophytic mass showed inhomogenous enhancing pattern; and diagosed as …,Journal of the Korean Radiological Society,1987,*

An Elastic Matching-Based Registration Algorithm for Retinal Images Using Vascular Structure,Bin Fang; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,ABSTRACT Temporal registration of retinal images is fundamental in tracking evolution ofeye-related diseases and providing important information for physicians to decide furthertreatments. In this paper; we propose an elastic matching-based registration algorithm forfundus images using vascular structure features. A two-stage process is first presented toidentify and extract vascular structure. Vessels are enhanced by mathematical morphologytransformation with respect to their spatial properties and are differentiated from backgroundpatterns by curvature evaluation and linear filtering. Morphology reconstruction is performedusing dynamic local region growing to recover the complete vascular structure. With therecovered vascular structure; we perform the registration using an elastic matchingalgorithm. Prior to registration; the extracted vessels are thinned and approximated using …,*,*,*
Utilizing the Subjective Intent of Authoring Formats to Perform Focused Web Crawling,Hok Peng Leung; Wynne Hsu,A successful web information retrieval system requires the ability to determine quickly andaccurately whether a document or a link should be further explored. Current state-of-the-artweb search engines typically use the meta-information in the HTML header to determine therelevancy of the documents. However; many documents on the web do not have such HTMLheader information. On the other hand; most web documents are formatted carefully toconvey some messages to the readers. The hidden information; embedded in theseformatting tags; serves as a good source for determining the relevancy of a document withrespect to the query context. In this paper; we propose a fast and accurate approach todetermining the relevancy of a document by taking into account the information embeddedwithin these formatting tags. Using such information; we are able to quickly narrow down …,*,*,*

A Corba Based Integrated QoS Support For Distributed Multimedia Applications,Hung Keng Pung; Wynne Hsu; WC Wong,ABSTRACT Advance object oriented computing platform such as the Common ObjectRequest Broker Architecture (CORBA) provides a conducive and standardized frameworkfor the development of distributed applications. Most of the off-the-shelf CORBA areimplemented over legacy network transports and distributed processing platforms such asTCP/IP and RPC. They are not suitable for real-time applications due to their highprocessing overheads; and lack of features and mechanisms in supporting quality of serviceboth at the network level and at the end-host level. To overcome this limitation we havedesigned and implemented a CORBA-based Real Time Stream Service (RTSS) that allowsreal-time streams to be managed through the'CORBA channel'but by-passing the heavyCORBA protocol stacks. RTSS aims to achieve an integrated QOS framework that …,*,*,*

Query based Personalized Search in Tag Social Systems,Gang Zhao; Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu; Jiawei Zhang,ABSTRACT Online social networks (OSNs) like Delicious; Facebook and Flicker arebecoming more and more popular with both users of Web 2.0 and academic researchers fornew opportunities. Users of such web sites can use tags to annotate various resources andshare them with their friends. With this new way of sharing and managing resources in thesocial systems; the challenge is to incorporate this additional information to retrieve relevantresources for the querying users. In this paper; we focus on the problem of improving searchin tag social systems. We first show the weakness of the existing user-centric friendship-based solutions where the strength of a friendship is determined by the degree ofoverlapping tags or resources among users. Such solutions may not be able to retrieverelevant results as they do not consider whether these friends are qualified to answer the …,*,*,*
Topband Queries in Time Series Data,Ling Li; Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu,Abstract Top-k queries have been extensively studied in various snapshot databases anddata streams for applications where the state of an object is static with respect to time. Weobserve that decision-makers are often interested in a set of objects that exhibit a certaindegree of consistent performance over time. In this paper; we introduce a new class ofqueries called⌈ k⌉-topband that is able to retrieve objects that are within top k at every timepoint over a specified time interval. Topband queries can be processed using standard SQLand existing top-k methods. However; the SQL method requires the nested loops to computethe top-k result; while the top-k approach leads to large intermediate results and wastedcomputations. We design a rank-based approach to address these shortcomings.Experiment results on both synthetic and real world datasets indicate that the proposed …,*,*,*
Efficient Remote Homology Detection with Secondary Structure,Yuna Hou; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee,ABSTRACT Motivation: The function of an unknown biological sequence can often beaccurately inferred if we are able to map this unknown sequence to its correspondinghomologous family. Currently; discriminative approach which combines support vectormachine and sequence similarity is recognized as the most accurate approach. SVM-Fisherand SVM-pairwise methods are two representatives of this approach; and SVM-pairwise isthe most accurate method. However; these methods only encode sequence information intotheir feature vectors and ignore the structure information. In addition; one of their majordrawbacks is their computation inefficiency. Based on this observation; we present analternative method for SVM-based protein classification. Our method; SVM-I-sites; usesstructure similarity instead of sequence similarity for remote homology detection. Our …,*,*,*

In our method; we aim at looking forinformative and discriminatory feature subset. Then; we build classification models withthese feature subsets. We find some general properties of promising 3G users; ie; the falsepositive predictions. These properties should be useful for easily differentiating the 3Gmobile phone users.,*,*,*
