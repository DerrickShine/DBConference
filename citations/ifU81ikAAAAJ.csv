Managing trust in a peer-2-peer information system,Karl Aberer; Zoran Despotovic,Abstract Managing trust is a problem of particular importance in peer-to-peer environmentswhere one frequently encounters unknown agents. Existing methods for trust management;that are based on reputation; focus on the semantic properties of the trust model. They donot scale as they either rely on a central database or require to maintain global knowledgeat each agent to provide data on earlier interactions. In this paper we present an approachthat addresses the problem of reputation-based trust management at both the datamanagement and the semantic level. We employ at both levels scalable data structures andalgorithms that require no central control and allow to assess trust by computing an agentsreputation from its former interactions with other agents. Thus the meethod can beimplemented in a peer-to-peer environment and scales well for very large numbers of …,Proceedings of the tenth international conference on Information and knowledge management,2001,1377
P-Grid: A self-organizing access structure for P2P information systems,Karl Aberer,Abstract Peer-To-Peer systems are driving a major paradigm shift in the era of genuinelydistributed computing. Gnutella is a good example of a Peer-To-Peer success story: a rathersimple software enables Internet users to freely exchange files; such as MP3 music files. Butit shows up also some of the limitations of current P2P information systems with respect totheir ability to manage data efficiently. In this paper we introduce P-Grid; a scalable accessstructure that is specifically designed for Peer-To-Peer information systems. P-Grids areconstructed and maintained by using randomized algorithms strictly based on localinteractions; provide reliable data access even with unreliable peers; and scale gracefullyboth in storage and communication cost.,International Conference on Cooperative Information Systems,2001,672
P-Grid: a self-organizing structured P2P system,Karl Aberer; Philippe Cudré-Mauroux; Anwitaman Datta; Zoran Despotovic; Manfred Hauswirth; Magdalena Punceva; Roman Schmidt,In the P2P community a fundamental distinction is made among unstructured and structuredP2P systems for resource location. In unstructured P2P systems in principle peers areunaware of the resources that neighboring peers in the overlay networks maintain. Typicallythey resolve search requests by flooding techniques. Gnutella [9] is the most prominentexample of this class. In contrast; in structured P2P systems peers maintain informationabout what resources neighboring peers offer. Thus queries can be directed and inconsequence substantially fewer messages are needed. This comes at the cost of increasedmaintenance efforts during changes in the overlay network as a result of peers joining orleaving. The most prominent class of approaches to structured P2P systems are distributedhash tables (DHT); for example Chord [17]. Unstructured P2P systems have generated …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2003,532
CrossFlow: Cross-organizational workflow management in dynamic virtual enterprises,Paul Grefen; Karl Aberer; Yigal Hoffner; Heiko Ludwig,Nowadays; many organizations form dynamic partnerships to effectively deal with marketrequirements. Companies focus on their core business and outsource secondary activities toother organizations. Growing complexity of products requires co-makership relationsbetween organizations. Value chains require a tight cooperation between companiesparticipating in these chains. As a result; the creation of virtual organizations has become amajor issue. To enable their operation; the information processing infrastructures of theparticipating organizations need to be linked. In the context of the close cooperationbetween companies; automated support for processes crossing organizational boundariesis an essential element [27].

Infrastructure for data processing in large-scale interconnected sensor networks,Karl Aberer; Manfred Hauswirth; Ali Salehi,With the price of wireless sensor technologies diminishing rapidly we can expect largenumbers of autonomous sensor networks being deployed in the near future. These sensornetworks will typically not remain isolated but the need of interconnecting them on thenetwork level to enable integrated data processing will arise; thus realizing the vision of aglobal" sensor Internet." This requires a flexible middleware layer which abstracts from theunderlying; heterogeneous sensor network technologies and supports fast and simpledeployment and addition of new platforms; facilitates efficient distributed query processingand combination of sensor data; provides support for sensor mobility; and enables thedynamic adaption of the system configuration during runtime with minimal (zero-programming) effort.

QoS-based service selection and ranking with trust and reputation management,Le-Hung Vu; Manfred Hauswirth; Karl Aberer,Abstract QoS-based service selection mechanisms will play an essential role in service-oriented architectures; as e-Business applications want to use services that most accuratelymeet their requirements. Standard approaches in this field typically are based on theprediction of services' performance from the quality advertised by providers as well as fromfeedback of users on the actual levels of QoS delivered to them. The key issue in this settingis to detect and deal with false ratings by dishonest providers and users; which has onlyreceived limited attention so far. In this paper; we present a new QoS-based semantic webservice selection and ranking solution with the application of a trust and reputationmanagement method to address this problem. We will give a formal description of ourapproach and validate it with experiments which demonstrate that our solution yields high …,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2005,348

Gridvine: Building internet-scale semantic overlay networks,Karl Aberer; Philippe Cudré-Mauroux; Manfred Hauswirth; Tim Van Pelt,Abstract This paper addresses the problem of building scalable semantic overlay networks.Our approach follows the principle of data independence by separating a logical layer; thesemantic overlay for managing and mapping data and metadata schemas; from a physicallayer consisting of a structured peer-to-peer overlay network for efficient routing ofmessages. The physical layer is used to implement various functions at the logical layer;including attribute-based search; schema management and schema mapping management.The separation of a physical from a logical layer allows us to process logical operations inthe semantic overlay using different physical execution strategies. In particular we identifyiterative and recursive strategies for the traversal of semantic overlay networks as twoimportant alternatives. At the logical layer we support semantic interoperability through …,International semantic web conference,2004,291

In this paper; wecharacterize the propagation of URLs in the social network of Twitter; a popularmicroblogging site. We track 15 million URLs exchanged among 2.7 million users over a300 hour period. Data analysis uncovers several statistical regularities in the user activity;the social graph; the structure of the URL cascades and the communication dynamics.,WOSN,2010,272
Updates in highly unreliable; replicated peer-to-peer systems,Anwitaman Datta; Manfred Hauswirth; Karl Aberer,This paper studies the problem of updates in decentralised and self-organising P2P systemsin which peers have low online probabilities and only local knowledge. The update strategywe propose for this environment is based on a hybrid push/pull rumor spreading algorithmand provides a fully decentralised; efficient and robust communication scheme which offersprobabilistic guarantees rather than ensuring strict consistency. We describe a genericanalytical model to investigate the utility of our hybrid update propagation scheme from theperspective of communication overhead.,Distributed Computing Systems; 2003.

The chatty web: emergent semantics through gossiping,Karl Aberer; Philippe Cudré-Mauroux; Manfred Hauswirth,Abstract This paper describes a novel approach for obtaining semantic interoperabilityamong data sources in a bottom-up; semi-automatic manner without relying on pre-existing;global semantic models. We assume that large amounts of data exist that have beenorganized and annotated according to local schemas. Seeing semantics as a form ofagreement; our approach enables the participating data sources to incrementally developglobal agreement in an evolutionary and completely decentralized process that solely relieson pair-wise; local interactions: Participants provide translations between schemas they areinterested in and can learn about other translations by routing queries (gossiping).

Jedi: Extracting and synthesizing information from the web,Gerald Huck; Peter Frankhauser; Karl Aberer; Erich Neuhold,Jedi (Java based Extraction and Dissemination of Information) is a lightweight tool for thecreation of wrappers and mediators to extract; combine; and reconcile information fromseveral independent information sources. For wrappers it uses attributed grammars; whichare evaluated with a fault-tolerant parsing strategy to cope with ambiguous grammars andirregular sources. For mediation it uses a simple generic object-model that can be extendedwith Java-libraries for specific models such as HTML; XML or the relational model.

Energy-efficient continuous activity recognition on mobile phones: An activity-adaptive approach,Zhixian Yan; Vigneshwaran Subbaraju; Dipanjan Chakraborty; Archan Misra; Karl Aberer,Power consumption on mobile phones is a painful obstacle towards adoption of continuoussensing driven applications; eg; continuously inferring individual's locomotive activities(such as' sit';'stand'or'walk') using the embedded accelerometer sensor. To reduce theenergy overhead of such continuous activity sensing; we first investigate how the choice ofaccelerometer sampling frequency & classification features affects; separately for eachactivity; the" energy overhead" vs." classification accuracy" tradeoff. We find that suchtradeoff is activity specific. Based on this finding; we introduce an activity-sensitive strategy(dubbed" A3R"-Adaptive Accelerometer-based Activity Recognition) for continuous activityrecognition; where the choice of both the accelerometer sampling frequency and theclassification features are adapted in real-time; as an individual performs daily lifestyle …,Wearable Computers (ISWC); 2012 16th International Symposium on,2012,201
The essence of P2P: A reference architecture for overlay networks,Karl Aberer; Luc Onana Alima; Ali Ghodsi; Sarunas Girdzijauskas; Seif Haridi; Manfred Hauswirth,The success of the P2P idea has created a huge diversity of approaches; among whichoverlay networks; for example; Gnutella; Kazaa; Chord; Pastry; Tapestry; P-Grid; or DKS;have received specific attention from both developers and researchers. A wide variety ofalgorithms; data structures; and architectures have been proposed. The terminologies andabstractions used; however; have become quite inconsistent since the P2P paradigm hasattracted people from many different communities; eg; networking; databases; distributedsystems; graph theory; complexity theory; biology; etc. In this paper we propose a referencemodel for overlay networks which is capable of modeling different approaches in thisdomain in a generic manner. It is intended to allow researchers and users to assess theproperties of concrete systems; to establish a common vocabulary for scientific discussion …,Peer-to-Peer Computing; 2005. P2P 2005.

Autonomous gossiping: A self-organizing epidemic algorithm for selective information dissemination in wireless mobile ad-hoc networks,Anwitaman Datta; Silvia Quarteroni; Karl Aberer,Abstract We introduce autonomous gossiping (A/G); a new genre epidemic algorithm forselective dissemination of information in contrast to previous usage of epidemic algorithmswhich flood the whole network. A/G is a paradigm which suits well in a mobile ad-hocnetworking (MANET) environment because it does not require any infrastructure ormiddleware like multicast tree and (un) subscription maintenance for publish/subscribe; butuses ecological and economic principles in a self-organizing manner in order to achieve anyarbitrary selectivity (flexible casting). The trade-off of using a stateless self-organizingmechanism like A/G is that it does not guarantee completeness deterministically as is one ofthe original objectives of alternate selective dissemination schemes like publish/subscribe.We argue that such incompleteness is not a problem in many non-critical real-life civilian …,*,2004,174
SeMiTri: a framework for semantic annotation of heterogeneous trajectories,Zhixian Yan; Dipanjan Chakraborty; Christine Parent; Stefano Spaccapietra; Karl Aberer,Abstract GPS devices allow recording the movement track of the moving object they areattached to. This data typically consists of a stream of spatio-temporal (x; y; t) points. Forapplication purposes the stream is transformed into finite subsequences called trajectories.Existing knowledge extraction algorithms defined for trajectories mainly assume a specificcontext (eg vehicle movements) or analyze specific parts of a trajectory (eg stops); inassociation with data from chosen geographic sources (eg points-of-interest; road networks).We investigate a more comprehensive semantic annotation framework that allows enrichingtrajectories with any kind of semantic data provided by multiple 3rd party sources. This paperpresents SeMiTri-the framework that enables annotating trajectories for any kind of movingobjects. Doing so; the application can benefit from a" semantic trajectory" representation …,Proceedings of the 14th international conference on extending database technology,2011,169
An Overview of Peer-to-Peer Information Systems.,Karl Aberer; Manfred Hauswirth,Abstract The limitations of client/server systems become evident in an Internetscaledistributed environment. P2P systems offer an alternative to traditional client/server systems:Every node acts both as a client and a server and “pays” its participation by providing accessto its computing resources. Systems such as Napster and Gnutella have proven theirpractical applicability.

Today; we expect to witness the extension of this revolution withthe wide adoption of meta-data standards like RDF or OWL underpinning the creation of asemantic web. Again; we hope for global properties to emerge from a multiplicity of pair-wise; local interactions; resulting eventually in a self-stabilizing semantic infrastructure. Thispaper represents an effort to summarize the conditions under which this revolution wouldtake place as well as an attempt to underline its main properties; limitations and possibleapplications.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2004,164
P2P reputation management: Probabilistic estimation vs. social networks,Zoran Despotovic; Karl Aberer,Abstract Managing trust is a key issue for a wide acceptance of P2P computing; particularlyin critical areas such as e-commerce. Reputation-based trust management has beenidentified in the literature as a viable solution to the problem. The current work in the fieldcan be roughly divided into two groups: social networks that rely on aggregating the entireavailable feedback in the network in hope achieving as much robustness against possiblemisbehavior as possible and probabilistic models that rely on the well known probabilisticestimation techniques but use only a limited fraction of the available feedback. In this paperwe provide first an overview of these techniques and then a comprehensive comparison ofthe two classes of approaches. We test their performance against various classes ofcollusive peer behavior and analyze their properties with respect to the implementation …,Computer Networks,2006,160
Range queries in trie-structured overlays,Anwitaman Datta; Manfred Hauswirth; Renault John; Roman Schmidt; Karl Aberer,Among the open problems in P2P systems; support for nontrivial search predicates;standardized query languages; distributed query processing; query load balancing; andquality of query results have been identified as some of the most relevant issues. This paperdescribes how range queries as an important nontrivial search predicate can be supportedin a structured overlay network that provides O (log n) search complexity on top of a trieabstraction. We provide analytical results that show that the proposed approach is efficient;supports arbitrary granularity of ranges; and demonstrate that its algorithmic complexity interms of messages is independent of the size of the queried ranges and only depends onthe size of the result set. In contrast to other systems which provide evaluation results onlythrough simulations; we validate the theoretical analysis of the algorithms with large-scale …,Peer-to-Peer Computing; 2005.

A self-organized; fault-tolerant and scalable replication scheme for cloud storage,Nicolas Bonvin; Thanasis G Papaioannou; Karl Aberer,Abstract Failures of any type are common in current datacenters; partly due to the higherscales of the data stored. As data scales up; its availability becomes more complex; whiledifferent availability levels per application or per data item may be required. In this paper; wepropose a self-managed key-value store that dynamically allocates the resources of a datacloud to several applications in a cost-efficient and fair way. Our approach offers anddynamically maintains multiple differentiated availability guarantees to each differentapplication despite failures. We employ a virtual economy; where each data partition (ie akey range in a consistent-hashing space) acts as an individual optimizer and chooseswhether to migrate; replicate or remove itself based on net benefit maximization regardingthe utility offered by the partition and its storage and maintenance cost.

Deriving service models in cross-organizational workflows,Justus Klingemann; Jurgen Wasch; Karl Aberer,Competitive markets force companies to form virtual enterprises by outsourcing activities toexternal service providers. The workflow concept has been very successful in streamliningbusiness processes by automating the coordination of activities; but has so far been limitedto use within single organizations. To address the problems of cross-organizationalworkflows; we use a service-oriented workflow model. Within this approach; we present atechnique to derive a model of the external services; based on continuous-time Markovchains; by analysing their externally observable behaviour. This allows one to assess thequality of the external services without compromising the autonomy of the service providers.,Research Issues on Data Engineering: Information Technology for Virtual Enterprises; 1999.

Semantic trajectories: Mobility data computation and annotation,Zhixian Yan; Dipanjan Chakraborty; Christine Parent; Stefano Spaccapietra; Karl Aberer,Abstract With the large-scale adoption of GPS equipped mobile sensing devices; positionaldata generated by moving objects (eg; vehicles; people; animals) are being easily collected.Such data are typically modeled as streams of spatio-temporal (x; y; t) points; calledtrajectories. In recent years trajectory management research has progressed significantlytowards efficient storage and indexing techniques; as well as suitable knowledge discovery.These works focused on the geometric aspect of the raw mobility data. We are nowwitnessing a growing demand in several application sectors (eg; from shipment tracking togeo-social networks) on understanding the semantic behavior of moving objects. Semanticbehavior refers to the use of semantic abstractions of the raw mobility data; including notonly geometric patterns but also knowledge extracted jointly from the mobility data and …,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST),2013,121
SoCo: a social network aided context-aware recommender system,Xin Liu; Karl Aberer,Abstract Contexts and social network information have been proven to be valuableinformation for building accurate recommender system. However; to the best of ourknowledge; no existing works systematically combine diverse types of such information tofurther improve recommendation quality. In this paper; we propose SoCo; a novel context-aware recommender system incorporating elaborately processed social networkinformation. We handle contextual information by applying random decision trees to partitionthe original user-item-rating matrix such that the ratings with similar contexts are grouped.Matrix factorization is then employed to predict missing preference of a user for an itemusing the partitioned matrix.

Towards p2p-based semantic web service discovery with qos support,Le-Hung Vu; Manfred Hauswirth; Karl Aberer,Abstract The growing number of web services advocates distributed discoveryinfrastructures which are semantics-enabled and support quality of service (QoS). In thispaper; we introduce a novel approach for semantic discovery of web services in P2P-basedregistries taking into account QoS characteristics. We distribute (semantic) serviceadvertisements among available registries such that it is possible to quickly identify therepositories containing the best probable matching services. Additionally; we represent theinformation relevant for the discovery process using Bloom filters and pre-computedmatching information such that search efforts are minimized when querying for services witha certain functional/QoS profile. Query results can be ranked and users can providefeedbacks on the actual QoS provided by a service.

Beyond "Web of trust": enabling P2P e-commerce,Anwitaman Datta; Manfred Hauswirth; Karl Aberer,The huge success of eBay has proven the demand for customer-to-customer (C2C)electronic commerce. eBay is a centralized infrastructure with all its scalability problems(network bandwidth; server load; availability; etc.). We argue that C2C e-commerce is anapplication domain that maps naturally onto the emergent field of P2P systems simply by itsunderlying interaction model of customers; ie; peers. This offers the opportunity to take P2Psystems beyond mere file sharing systems into interesting new application domains. Thelong-term goal would be to design a fully functional decentralized system which resembleseBay without eBay's dedicated; centralized infrastructure. Since security (authenticity; non-repudiation; trust; etc.) is key to any e-commerce infrastructure; our envisioned P2P e-commerce platform has to address this adequately. As the first step in this direction we …,E-Commerce; 2003. CEC 2003. IEEE International Conference on,2003,111

Personalized point-of-interest recommendation by mining users' preference transition,Xin Liu; Yong Liu; Karl Aberer; Chunyan Miao,Abstract Location-based social networks (LBSNs) offer researchers rich data to studypeople's online activities and mobility patterns. One important application of such studies isto provide personalized point-of-interest (POI) recommendations to enhance userexperience in LBSNs. Previous solutions directly predict users' preference on locations butfail to provide insights about users' preference transitions among locations. In this work; wepropose a novel category-aware POI recommendation model; which exploits the transitionpatterns of users' preference over location categories to improve location recommendationaccuracy.

Gridvine: An infrastructure for peer information management,Philippe Cudré-Mauroux; Suchit Agarwal; Karl Aberer,GridVine is a semantic overlay infrastructure based on a peer-to-peer (P2P) accessstructure. Built following the principle of data independence; it separates a logical layer-inwhich data; schemas; and schema mappings are managed-from a physical layer consistingof a structured P2P network supporting decentralized indexing; key load-balancing; andefficient routing. The system is decentralized; yet fosters semantic interoperability throughpair-wise schema mappings and query reformulation. GridVine's heterogeneous butsemantically related information sources can be queried transparently using iterative queryreformulation. The authors discuss a reference implementation of the system and severalmechanisms for resolving queries collaboratively.,IEEE Internet Computing,2007,105
Indexing data-oriented overlay networks,Karl Aberer; Anwitaman Datta; Manfred Hauswirth; Roman Schmidt,Abstract The application of structured overlay networks to implement index structures fordata-oriented applications such as peer-to-peer databases or peer-to-peer informationretrieval; requires highly efficient approaches for overlay construction; as changingapplication requirements frequently lead to re-indexing of the data and hence (re)construction of overlay networks. This problem has so far not been addressed in theliterature and thus we describe an approach for the efficient construction of data-oriented;structured overlay networks from scratch in a self-organized way. Standard maintenancealgorithms for overlay networks cannot accomplish this efficiently; as they are inherentlysequential. Our proposed algorithm is completely decentralized; parallel; and can constructa new overlay network with short latency. At the same time it ensures good load …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,97

At itscore; community sensing is a dynamic new form of mobile geosensor network. We believethat community sensing networks; in order to be widely deployable and sustainable; need tofollow utilitarian approaches towards sensing and data management.

Castor: Scalable secure routing for ad hoc networks,Wojciech Galuba; Panos Papadimitratos; Marcin Poturalski; Karl Aberer; Zoran Despotovic; Wolfgang Kellerer,Wireless ad hoc networks are inherently vulnerable; as any node can disrupt thecommunication of potentially any other node in the network. Many solutions to this problemhave been proposed. In this paper; we take a fresh and comprehensive approach thataddresses simultaneously three aspects: security; scalability and adaptability to changingnetwork conditions. Our communication protocol; Castor; occupies a unique point in thedesign space: it does not use any control messages except simple packetacknowledgments; and each node makes routing decisions locally and independentlywithout exchanging any routing state with other nodes. Its novel design makes Castorresilient to a wide range of attacks and allows the protocol to scale to large network sizesand to remain efficient under high mobility.

Scalable peer-to-peer web retrieval with highly discriminative keys,Ivana Podnar; Martin Rajman; Toan Luu; Fabius Klemm; Karl Aberer,The suitability of peer-to-peer (P2P) approaches for full-text Web retrieval has recently beenquestioned because of the claimed unacceptable bandwidth consumption induced byretrieval from very large document collections. In this contribution we formalize a novelindexing/retrieval model that achieves high performance; cost-efficient retrieval by indexingwith highly discriminative keys (HDKs) stored in a distributed global index maintained in astructured P2P network. HDKs correspond to carefully selected terms and term setsappearing in a small number of collection documents. We provide a theoretical analysis ofthe scalability of our retrieval model and report experimental results obtained with our HDK-based P2P retrieval engine. These results show that; despite increased indexing costs; thetotal traffic generated with the HDK approach is significantly smaller than the one …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007.

Distributed similarity search in high dimensions using locality sensitive hashing,Parisa Haghani; Sebastian Michel; Karl Aberer,Abstract In this paper we consider distributed K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) search and rangequery processing in high dimensional data. Our approach is based on Locality SensitiveHashing (LSH) which has proven very efficient in answering KNN queries in centralizedsettings. We consider mappings from the multi-dimensional LSH bucket space to the linearlyordered set of peers that jointly maintain the indexed data and derive requirements toachieve high quality search results and limit the number of network accesses. We putforward two such mappings that come with these salient properties: being locality preservingso that buckets likely to hold similar data are stored on the same or neighboring peers andhaving a predictable output distribution to ensure fair load balancing. We show how toleverage the linearly aligned data for efficient KNN search and how to efficiently process …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,80
A search engine for QoS-enabled discovery of semantic web services,Le-Hung Vu; Manfred Hauswirth; Fabio Porto; Karl Aberer,Directory services are a genuine constituent of any distributed architecture which facilitatebinding attributes to names and then querying this information; that is; announcing anddiscovering resources. In such contexts; especially in a business environment; Quality ofService (QoS) and non-functional properties are usually the most important criteria to decidewhether a specific resource will be used. To address this problem; we present an approachto the semantic description and discovery of web services which specifically takes intoaccount their QoS properties. Our solution uses a robust trust and reputation model toprovide an accurate picture of the actual QoS to user. The search engine is based on analgebraic discovery model and uses adaptive query-processing techniques to paralleliseexpensive operators. Architecturally; the engine can be run as a centralised service for …,International Journal of Business Process Integration and Management,2006,80
Autonomic SLA-driven provisioning for cloud applications,Nicolas Bonvin; Thanasis G Papaioannou; Karl Aberer,Abstract Significant achievements have been made for automated allocation of cloudresources. However; the performance of applications may be poor in peak load periods;unless their cloud resources are dynamically adjusted. Moreover; although cloud resourcesdedicated to different applications are virtually isolated; performance fluctuations do occurbecause of resource sharing; and software or hardware failures (eg unstable virtualmachines; power outages; etc.). In this paper; we propose a decentralized economicapproach for dynamically adapting the cloud resources of various applications; so as tostatistically meet their SLA performance and availability goals in the presence of varyingloads or failures. According to our approach; the dynamic economic fitness of a Web servicedetermines whether it is replicated or migrated to another server; or deleted.

Efficient; self-contained handling of identity in peer-to-peer systems,Karl Aberer; Anwitaman Datta; Manfred Hauswirth,Identification is an essential building block for many services in distributed informationsystems. The quality and purpose of identification may differ; but the basic underlyingproblem is always to bind a set of attributes to an identifier in a unique and deterministicway. Name/directory services; such as DNS; X. 500; or UDDI; are a well-established conceptto address this problem in distributed information systems. However; none of these servicesaddresses the specific requirements of peer-to-peer systems with respect to dynamism;decentralization; and maintenance. We propose the implementation of directories using astructured peer-to-peer overlay network and apply this approach to support self-containedmaintenance of routing tables with dynamic IP addresses in structured P2P systems. Thus;we keep routing tables intact without affecting the organization of the overlay networks …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,74
Object-oriented modeling for hypermedia systems using the VODAK model language,Wolfgang Klas; Karl Aberer; Erich Neuhold,Abstract More and more documents become available in electronic form; eg; in thepublishing sector; product design and specification; documentation; medical records; etc.Real applications in industry have a serious problem of handling masses of documents.Therefore; there is a growing demand of database support in the areas of documentmodelling; in particular hypermedia document modelling; ie documents containingmultimedia data. As documents represent intrinsically complex structured data object-oriented database management (OODBMS) technology with its ability to handle such kind ofinformation offers itself as a very promising way to tackle this problem as opposed toconventional database technology which was designed to handle simple structured data.OODBMS technology; although fairly developed today; needs to be extended and …,*,1994,74
Internet-Scale Storage Systems under Churn--A Study of the Steady-State using Markov Models,Anwitaman Datta; Karl Aberer,Content storage in a distributed collaborative environment uses redundancy for betterresilience and thus provides good availability and durability. In a peer-to-peer environment;where peers continuously leave and rejoin the network; various lazy strategies can beemployed to maintain a minimal redundancy of stored content in the system. Existing staticresilience analyses fail to capture in detail the system's behavior over time; particularly theprobability mass function of the actual available redundancy; since it ignores the crucialinterplay between churn and maintenance operations; and looks only at the average systemproperty. We perform a Markovian time-evolution analysis of the system specified byprobability mass function of each possible system state; and establish that given a fixed rateof churn and a specific maintenance strategy; the system operates in a corresponding …,Peer-to-Peer Computing; 2006.

Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Peers" Performance in P2P Networks,Zoran Despotovic; Karl Aberer,Abstract The problem of encouraging trustworthy behavior in P2P online communities bymanaging peers' reputations has drawn a lot of attention recently. However; most of theproposed solutions exhibit the following two problems: huge implementation overhead andunclear trust related model semantics. In this paper we show that a simple probabilistictechnique; maximum likelihood estimation namely; can reduce these two problemssubstantially when employed as the feedback aggregation strategy. Thus; no complexexploration of the feedback is necessary. Instead; simple; intuitive and efficient probabilisicestimation methods suffice.,The Second Workshop on the Economics of Peer-to-Peer Systems,2004,69
Supporting Temporal Multimedia Operations in Object-Oriented Database Systems.,Karl Aberer; Wolfgang Klas,Advanced applications in fields like electronic publishing and telecooperation face theproblem of handling multimedia information. Conventional database systems do not offeradequate support for storage management as they do not provide for the modeling;indexing; and manipulation of multimedia data. Database management systems need to beextended if they should be able to handle multimedia information like audio and video. Inthis paper we present an approach of extending the data model of an object-orienteddatabase system by means of schedules which allow for the description of the temporalcharacteristics of multimedia operations as they occur when modeling time-dependent datalike audio and video. First; we present a model of schedules and define the basic conceptsand semantics to execute time-dependent operations. Second; we introduce the …,ICMCS,1994,67
A framework for semantic gossiping,Karl Aberer; Philippe Cudré-Mauroux; Manfred Hauswirth,Abstract Today the problem of semantic interoperability in information search on the Internetis solved mostly by means of centralization; both at a system and at a logical level. Thisapproach has been successful to a certain extent. Peer-to-peer systems as a new brand ofsystem architectures indicate that the principle of decentralization might offer new solutionsto many problems that scale well to very large numbers of users. In this paper we outlinehow the peer-to-peer system architectures can be applied to tackle the problem of semanticinteroperability in the large; driven in a bottom-up manner by the participating peers. Such asystem can readily be used to study semantic interoperability as a global scale phenomenontaking place in a social network of information sharing peers.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2002,66
Global sensor networks,Karl Aberer; Manfred Hauswirth; Ali Salehi,Abstract The availability of cheap and smart wireless sensing devices providesunprecedented possibilities to monitor the physical world. On the technical side thesedevices introduce several original research problems; many of them related to theintegration of the rampant technology proposals. Global Sensor Network (GSN) is a platformwhich provides a scalable infrastructure for integrating heterogeneous sensor networktechnologies using a small set of powerful abstractions. GSN supports the integration anddiscovery of sensor networks and sensor data; provides distributed querying; filtering; andcombination of sensor data; and supports the dynamic adaption of the system configurationduring operation through a declarative XML-based language.,*,2006,65
Semantic query optimization for methods in object-oriented database systems,Karl Aberer; Gisela Fischer,Although the main difference between the relational and the object-oriented data model isthe possibility to define object behavior; query optimization techniques in object-orienteddatabase systems are mainly based on the structural part of objects. We claim that theoptimization potential emerging from methods has been strongly underestimated so far. Inthis paper we concentrate on the question of how semantic knowledge about methods canbe considered in query optimization. We rely on the algebraic and rule-based approach forquery optimization and present a framework that allows to integrate schema-specificknowledge by tailoring the query optimizer according to the particular application's needs.We sketch an implementation of our concepts within the OODBMS VODAK using theVolcano optimizer generator.,Data Engineering; 1995.

Query optimization in XML structured-document databases,Dunren Che; Karl Aberer; M Tamer Özsu,Abstract While the information published in the form of XML-compliant documents keeps fastmounting up; efficient and effective query processing and optimization for XML have nowbecome more important than ever. This article reports our recent advances in XMLstructured-document query optimization. In this article; we elaborate on a novel approachand the techniques developed for XML query optimization. Our approach performs heuristic-based algebraic transformations on XPath queries; represented as PAT algebraicexpressions; to achieve query optimization. This article first presents a comprehensive set ofgeneral equivalences with regard to XML documents and XML queries. Based on theseequivalences; we developed a large set of deterministic algebraic transformation rules forXML query optimization.

Middleware support for the" Internet of Things",Karl Aberer; Manfred Hauswirth,Abstract. The “Internet of Things” intends to enhance items of our everyday life withinformation and/or processing and interconnect them; so that computers can sense;integrate; present; and react on all kinds of aspects of the physical world. As this implies thatenormous numbers of data sources need to be connected and related to each other; flexibleand dynamic middleware support essentially providing zero-programming deployment is akey requirement to cope with the sheer scale of this task and the heterogeneity of availabletechnologies. In this paper we briefly overview our Global Sensor Networks (GSN)middleware which supports these tasks and offers a flexible; zero-programming deploymentand integration infrastructure.

Adaptive outsourcing in cross-organizational workflows,Justus Klingemann; Jürgen Wäsch; Karl Aberer,Abstract The workflow concept has been very successful in streamlining business processesby automating the coordination of activities; but has so far been limited to the use withinsingle organizations. Any attempt to distribute workflows among different organizations hasto face the problems posed by the complex relationship among autonomous organizationsand their services. To address these problems we propose a service-oriented model forcross-organizational workflows. Modeling the workflow execution as a cooperation ofservices allows different organizations to interact via well-defined interfaces. We furthershow how the execution can be optimized by selecting services depending on theircontribution to quality criteria of the workflow.,International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering,1999,63
Structured document storage and refined declarative and navigational access mechanisms in HyperStorM,Klemens Böhm; Karl Aberer; Erich J Neuhold; Xiaoya Yang,Abstract The combination of SGML and database technology allows to refine bothdeclarative and navigational access mechanisms for structured document collection: withregard to declarative access; the user can formulate complex information needs withoutknowing a query language; the respective document type definition (DTD) or the underlyingmodelling. Navigational access is eased by hyperlink-rendition mechanisms going beyondplain link-integrity checking. With our approach; the database-internal representation ofdocuments is configurable. It allows for an efficient implementation of operations; becauseDTD knowledge is not needed for document structure recognition. We show how the numberof method invocations and the cost of parsing can be significantly reduced.,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,1997,61
Probabilistic message passing in peer data management systems,Philippe Cudre-Mauroux; Karl Aberer; Andras Feher,Until recently; most data integration techniques involved central components; eg; globalschemas; to enable transparent access to heterogeneous databases. Today; however; withthe democratization of tools facilitating knowledge elicitation in machine-processableformats; one cannot rely on global; centralized schemas anymore as knowledge creationand consumption are getting more and more dynamic and decentralized. Peer DataManagement Systems (PDMS) provide an answer to this problem by eliminating the centralsemantic component and considering instead compositions of local; pair-wise mappings topropagate queries from one database to the others. PDMS approaches proposed so farmake the implicit assumption that all mappings used in this way are correct. This obviouslycannot be taken as granted in typical PDMS settings where mappings can be created …,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06. Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on,2006,59
Electricity load forecasting for residential customers: Exploiting aggregation and correlation between households,Samuel Humeau; Tri Kurniawan Wijaya; Matteo Vasirani; Karl Aberer,The recent development of smart meters has allowed the analysis of household electricityconsumption in real time. Predicting electricity consumption at such very low scales shouldhelp to increase the efficiency of distribution networks and energy pricing. However; this isby no means a trivial task since household-level consumption is much more irregular than atthe transmission or distribution levels. In this work; we address the problem of improvingconsumption forecasting by using the statistical relations between consumption series. Thisis done both at the household and district scales (hundreds of houses); using variousmachine learning techniques; such as support vector machine for regression (SVR) andmultilayer perceptron (MLP). First; we determine which algorithm is best adapted to eachscale; then; we try to find leaders among the time series; to help short-term forecasting …,Sustainable Internet and ICT for Sustainability (SustainIT); 2013,2013,58
ProtoPeer: a P2P toolkit bridging the gap between simulation and live deployement,Wojciech Galuba; Karl Aberer; Zoran Despotovic; Wolfgang Kellerer,Abstract Simulators are a commonly used tool in peer-to-peer systems research. However;they may not be able to capture all the details of a system operating in a live network.Transitioning from the simulation to the actual system implementation is a non-trivial andtime-consuming task. We present ProtoPeer; a peer-to-peer systems prototyping toolkit thatallows for switching between the event-driven simulation and live network deploymentwithout changing any of the application code. ProtoPeer defines a set of APIs for messagepassing; message queuing; timer operations as well as overlay routing and managing theoverlay neighbors. Users can plug in their own custom implementations of most of the partsof ProtoPeer including custom network models for simulation and custom message passingover different network stacks.,Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Simulation Tools and Techniques,2009,55
Web text retrieval with a P2P query-driven index,Gleb Skobeltsyn; Toan Luu; Ivana Podnar Zarko; Martin Rajman; Karl Aberer,Abstract In this paper; we present a query-driven indexing/retrieval strategy for efficient fulltext retrieval from large document collections distributed within a structured P2P network.Our indexing strategy is based on two important properties:(1) the generated distributedindex stores posting lists for carefully chosen indexing term combinations; and (2) theposting lists containing too many document references are truncated to a bounded numberof their top-ranked elements. These two properties guarantee acceptable storage andbandwidth requirements; essentially because the number of indexing term combinationsremains scalable and the transmitted posting lists never exceed a constant size. However;as the number of generated term combinations can still become quite large; we also useterm statistics extracted from available query logs to index only such combinations that …,Proceedings of the 30th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2007,55

A decentralised public key infrastructure for customer-to-customer e-commerce,Karl Aberer; Anwitaman Datta; Manfred Hauswirth,The success story of eBay has shown the demand for customer-to-customer (C2C)electronic commerce. eBay is a centralised infrastructure with all its scalability problems(network bandwidth; server load; availability; etc.). In this paper; we argue that C2C e-commerce is an application domain that maps naturally onto the emerging field of peer-to-peer (P2P) systems simply by its underlying interaction model of customers; ie; peers. Thisoffers the opportunity to take P2P systems beyond mere file sharing systems into interestingnew application domains. The long-term goal would be to design a fully functionaldecentralised system which resembles eBay without eBay's dedicated; centralisedinfrastructure.

The approach of the Integrated Publication and Information SystemsInstitute (IPSI) to support electronic publishing is to build an integrated publicationenvironment. The publication of electronic documents demands enhanced support frompublishing tools and imposes new challenges on database technology. Taking ahypermedia reference publication as an example; requirements on database technology forthe production of electronic publications are discussed. Those can be met by using an object-oriented database management system like VODAK.

Evaluating top-k queries over incomplete data streams,Parisa Haghani; Sebastian Michel; Karl Aberer,Abstract We study the problem of continuous monitoring of top-k queries over multiple non-synchronized streams. Assuming a sliding window model; this general problem has been awell addressed research topic in recent years. Most approaches; however; assumesynchronized streams where all attributes of an object are known simultaneously to thequery processing engine. In many streaming scenarios though; different attributes of an itemare reported in separate non-synchronized streams which do not allow for exact scorecalculations. We present how the traditional notion of object dominance changes in this casesuch that the k dominance set still includes all and only those objects which have a chanceof being among the top-k results in their life time. Based on this; we propose an exactalgorithm which builds on generating multiple instances of the same object in a way that …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,50
Multifaceted Simultaneous Load Balancing in DHT-based P2P systems: A new game with old balls and bins,Karl Aberer; Anwitaman Datta; Manfred Hauswirth,Abstract This paper presents and evaluates uncoordinated on-line algorithms forsimultaneous storage and replication load-balancing in DHT-based peer-to-peer systems.We compare our approach with the classical balls into bins model; and point out both thesimilarities as well as the differences which call for new load-balancing mechanismsspecifically targeted at P2P systems. Some of the peculiarities of P2P systems; which makeour problem challenging are that both the network membership and the data indexed in thenetwork are dynamic; there is neither global coordination nor global information to rely on;and the load-balancing mechanism ideally should not compromise the structural propertiesand thus the search efficiency of the DHT; while preserving the semantic information of thedata (eg; lexicographic ordering to enable range searches).,*,2005,48

Using a rule-based approach for queryoptimization and applying it to such queries; we deploy knowledge on Document TypeDefinition (DTD) to formulate transformation rules for query-algebra terms. Specifically; welook at rules that serve navigation along paths by cutting off these paths or by replacing themwith access operations to indices; ie; materialized views on paths. We show for both casesthat we correctly apply and completely exploit knowledge on the DTD; and we briefly discussperformance results.,Research and Technology Advances in Digital Libraries; 1998.

Minimizing efforts in validating crowd answers,Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung; Duong Chi Thang; Matthias Weidlich; Karl Aberer,Abstract In recent years; crowdsourcing has become essential in a wide range of Webapplications. One of the biggest challenges of crowdsourcing is the quality of crowd answersas workers have wide-ranging levels of expertise and the worker community may containfaulty workers. Although various techniques for quality control have been proposed; a post-processing phase in which crowd answers are validated is still required. Validation istypically conducted by experts; whose availability is limited and who incur high costs.Therefore; we develop a probabilistic model that helps to identify the most beneficialvalidation questions in terms of both; improvement of result correctness and detection offaulty workers. Our approach allows us to guide the expert's work by collecting input on themost problematic cases; thereby achieving a set of high quality answers even if the expert …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,46
Enabling secure secret sharing in distributed online social networks,Le-Hung Vu; Karl Aberer; Sonja Buchegger; Anwitaman Datta,We study a new application of threshold-based secret sharing in a distributed online socialnetwork (DOSN); where users need a means to back up and recover their private keys in anetwork of untrusted servers. Using a simple threshold-based secret sharing in such anenvironment is insufficiently secured since delegates keeping the secret shares may colludeto steal the user's private keys. To mitigate this problem; we propose using differenttechniques to improve the system security: by selecting only the most reliable delegates forkeeping these shares and further by encrypting the shares with passwords. We develop amechanism to select the most reliable delegates based on an effective trust measure.Specifically; relationships among the secret owner; delegate candidates and their relatedfriends are used to estimate the trustworthiness of a delegate.

Efficient probabilistic subsumption checking for content-based publish/subscribe systems,Aris M Ouksel; Oana Jurca; Ivana Podnar; Karl Aberer,Abstract Efficient subsumption checking; deciding whether a subscription or publication iscovered by a set of previously defined subscriptions; is of paramount importance forpublish/subscribe systems. It provides the core system functionality—matching ofpublications to subscriber needs expressed as sub-scriptions—and additionally; reduces theoverall system load and generated traffic since the covered subscriptions are notpropagated in distributed environments. As the subsumption problem was shown previouslyto be co-NP complete and existing solutions typically apply pairwise comparisons to detectthe subsumption relationship; we propose a 'Monte Carlo type'probabilistic algorithm for thegeneral subsumption problem. It determines whether a publication/subscription is coveredby a disjunction of subscriptions in O (kmd); where k is the number of subscriptions; m is …,ACM/IFIP/USENIX International Conference on Distributed Systems Platforms and Open Distributed Processing,2006,46
Distributed cache table: efficient query-driven processing of multi-term queries in p2p networks,Gleb Skobeltsyn; Karl Aberer,Abstract The state-of-the-art techniques for processing multi-term queries in P2Penvironments are query flooding and inverted list intersection. However; it has been shownthat due to scalability reasons both methods fail to support full-text search in large scaledocument collections distributed among the nodes in a P2P network. Although a number ofoptimizations have been suggested recently based on the aforementioned techniques; littleevidence is given on their scalability. In this paper we suggest a novel query-driven indexingstrategy which generates and maintains only those index entries that are actually used forquery processing. In our approach called Distributed Cache Table< u> 1 By analogy withDistributed Hash Table (DHT)(DCT) we suggest to abandon the difference between dataindexing and query caching; and to store result sets (caches) for the most profitable …,Proceedings of the international workshop on Information retrieval in peer-to-peer networks,2006,46

Efficient Processing of XPath Queries with Structured Overlay Networks,Gleb Skobeltsyn; Manfred Hauswirth; Karl Aberer,Abstract Non-trivial search predicates beyond mere equality are at the current focus of P2Presearch. Structured queries; as an important type of non-trivial search; have been studiedextensively mainly for unstructured P2P systems so far. As unstructured P2P systems do notuse indexing; structured queries are very easy to implement since they can be treatedequally to any other type of query. However; this comes at the expense of very highbandwidth consumption and limitations in terms of guarantees and expressiveness that canbe provided. Structured P2P systems are an efficient alternative as they typically offerlogarithmic search complexity in the number of peers. Though the use of a distributed index(typically a distributed hash table) makes the implementation of structured queries moreefficient; it also introduces considerable complexity; and thus only a few approaches exist …,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2005,46
When bias matters: An economic assessment of demand response baselines for residential customers,Tri Kurniawan Wijaya; Matteo Vasirani; Karl Aberer,Demand response (DR) has been known to play an important role in the electricity sector tobalance supply and demand. To this end; the DR baseline is a key factor in a successful DRprogram since it influences the incentive allocation mechanism and customer participation.Previous studies have investigated baseline accuracy and bias for large; industrial andcommercial customers. However; the analysis of baseline performance for residentialcustomers has received less attention. In this paper; we analyze DR baselines for residentialcustomers. Our analysis goes beyond accuracy and bias by understanding the impact ofbaselines on all stakeholders' profit. Using our customer models; we successfully show howcustomer participation changes depending on the incentive actually received. We found that;in general; bias is more relevant than accuracy for determining which baseline provides …,IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid,2014,45
Scalable data access in peer-to-peer systems using unbalanced search trees,Karl Aberer,Abstract With the appearance of Peer-to-Peer information systems the interest in scalableand decentralized data access structures is attracting increasingly interest. We propose tothat end P-Grid; a scalable data access structure resulting from the distribution of a binaryprefix tree. When adapting the P-Grid structure to skewed data distributions one obtainsunbalanced search trees. The key result of this paper shows that unbalanced trees do notharm as long as communication is considered as the critical cost and the access structuresare constructed properly. Besides proving this result we propose the necessary distributed;randomized algorithms that allow to construct the P-Grid in a self-organized manner suchthat the tree structure dynamically adapts to the data distribution and the aforementionedresult is applicable.,Workshop on Distributed Data & Structures (WDAS 2002),2002,45
Applying a flexible OODBMS-IRS-Coupling to structured document handling,Marc Volz; Karl Aberer; Klemens Bohm,In document management systems; it is desirable to provide content-based access todocuments going beyond regular expression search in addition to access based onstructural characteristics or associated attributes. We present a new approach for couplingOODBMSs (object-oriented database management systems) and IRSs (information retrievalsystems) that provides enhanced flexibility and functionality as compared to couplingapproaches reported from the literature. Our approach allows one to decide freely to whichdocument collections; that are used as retrieval context; document objects belong; which textcontents they provide for retrieval; and how they derive their associated retrieval values;either directly from the retrieval machine or from the values of related objects. Especially; weshow how; in this approach; different strategies can be applied to hierarchically structured …,Data Engineering; 1996. Proceedings of the Twelfth International Conference on,1996,45
XGSN: An Open-source Semantic Sensing Middleware for the Web of Things.,Jean-Paul Calbimonte; Sofiane Sarni; Julien Eberle; Karl Aberer,Abstract. We present XGSN; an open-source system that relies on semantic representationsof sensor metadata and observations; to guide the process of annotating and publishingsensor data on the Web. XGSN is able to handle the data acquisition process of a widenumber of devices and protocols; and is designed as a highly extensible platform;leveraging on the existing capabilities of the Global Sensor Networks (GSN) middleware.Going beyond traditional sensor management systems; XGSN is capable of enriching virtualsensor descriptions with semantically annotated content using standard vocabularies. In theproposed approach; sensor data and observations are annotated using an ontology networkbased on the SSN ontology; providing a standardized queryable representation that makesit easier to share; discover; integrate and interpret the data.

Neighborhood-based tag prediction,Adriana Budura; Sebastian Michel; Philippe Cudré-Mauroux; Karl Aberer,Abstract We consider the problem of tag prediction in collaborative tagging systems whereusers share and annotate resources on the Web. We put forward HAMLET; a novelapproach to automatically propagate tags along the edges of a graph which relates similardocuments. We identify the core principles underlying tag propagation for which we derivesuitable scoring models combined in one overall ranking formula. Leveraging these scores;we present an efficient top-k tag selection algorithm that infers additional tags by carefullyinspecting neighbors in the document graph. Experiments using real-world datademonstrate the viability of our approach in large-scale environments where tags arescarce.,European Semantic Web Conference,2009,44
An architecture for peer-to-peer information retrieval,Karl Aberer; Fabius Klemm; Martin Rajman; Jie Wu,Abstract Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems are very large computer networks; where peerscollaborate to provide a common service. Providing large-scale Information Retrieval (IR);eg for searching the Word Wide Web; is an appealing application for P2P systems. Theresearch community has presented several proposal for P2P-IR. However; so far theconcepts of P2P and of IR have been intermingled. In this paper; we propose an architectureto structure P2P-IR systems. We differentiate between concepts belonging to theconstruction and maintenance of a P2P overlay network; and those belonging to IR.Furthermore; we distinguish basic P2P-IR concepts; which are likely to be needed in all P2P-IR systems; and advanced P2P-IR concepts; that rather depend on the flavor of the system.This decomposition of the P2P retrieval process is an important step towards a structured …,27th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference (SIGIR 2004); Workshop on Peer-to-Peer Information Retrieval,2004,44
Viewpoints on emergent semantics,Philippe Cudré-Mauroux; Karl Aberer; Alia I Abdelmoty; Tiziana Catarci; Ernesto Damiani; Arantxa Illaramendi; Mustafa Jarrar; Robert Meersman; Erich J Neuhold; Christine Parent; Kai-Uwe Sattler; Monica Scannapieco; Stefano Spaccapietra; Peter Spyns; Guy De Tré,Abstract We introduce a novel view on how to deal with the problems of semanticinteroperability in distributed systems. This view is based on the concept of emergentsemantics; which sees both the representation of semantics and the discovery of the properinterpretation of symbols as the result of a self-organizing process performed by distributedagents exchanging symbols and having utilities dependent on the proper interpretation ofthe symbols. This is a complex systems perspective on the problem of dealing withsemantics. We highlight some of the distinctive features of our vision and point outpreliminary examples of its application.,*,2006,42
An evaluation of model-based approaches to sensor data compression,Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung; Hoyoung Jeung; Karl Aberer,As the volumes of sensor data being accumulated are likely to soar; data compression hasbecome essential in a wide range of sensor-data applications. This has led to a plethora ofdata compression techniques for sensor data; in particular model-based approaches havebeen spotlighted due to their significant compression performance. These methods;however; have never been compared and analyzed under the same setting; rendering a"right" choice of compression technique for a particular application very difficult. Addressingthis problem; this paper presents a benchmark that offers a comprehensive empirical studyon the performance comparison of the model-based compression techniques. Specifically;we reimplemented several state-of-the-art methods in a comparable manner; and measuredvarious performance factors with our benchmark; including compression ratio …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,41
Scalia: an adaptive scheme for efficient multi-cloud storage,Thanasis G Papaioannou; Nicolas Bonvin; Karl Aberer,A growing amount of data is produced daily resulting in a growing demand for storagesolutions. While cloud storage providers offer a virtually infinite storage capacity; dataowners seek geographical and provider diversity in data placement; in order to avoid vendorlock-in and to increase availability and durability. Moreover; depending on the customerdata access pattern; a certain cloud provider may be cheaper than another. In this paper; weintroduce Scalia; a cloud storage brokerage solution that continuously adapts the placementof data based on its access pattern and subject to optimization objectives; such as storagecosts. Scalia efficiently considers repositioning of only selected objects that may significantlylower the storage cost. By extensive simulation experiments; we prove the cost-effectivenessof Scalia against static placements and its proximity to the ideal data placement in various …,High Performance Computing; Networking; Storage and Analysis (SC); 2012 International Conference for,2012,41
The challenges of merging two similar structured overlays: A tale of two networks,Anwitaman Datta; Karl Aberer,Abstract Structured overlay networks is an important and interesting primitive that can beused by diverse peer-to-peer applications. Multiple overlays can result either because ofnetwork partitioning or (more likely) because different groups of peers build such overlaysseparately before coming in contact with each other and wishing to coalesce the overlaystogether. This paper is a first look into how multiple such overlays (all using the sameprotocols) can be merged–which is critical for usability and adoption of such an internet-scale distributed system. We elaborate how two networks using the same protocols can bemerged; looking specifically into two different overlay design principles:(i) maintaining thering invariant and (ii) structural replications; either of which are used in various overlaynetworks to guarantee functional correctness in a highly dynamic (membership changes) …,*,2006,41
Top-k/w publish/subscribe: finding k most relevant publications in sliding time window w,Krešimir Pripužić; Ivana Podnar Žarko; Karl Aberer,Abstract Existing content-based publish/subscribe systems are designed assuming that allmatching publications are equally relevant to a subscription. As we cannot know in advancethe distribution of publication content; the following two unwanted situations are highlypossible: a subscriber either receives too many or only few publications. In this paper wepresent a new publish/subscribe model which is based on the sliding window computationmodel. Our model assumes that publications have different relevance to a subscription. Inthe model; a subscriber receives k most relevant publications published within a timewindow w; where k and w are parameters defined per each subscription. As a consequence;the arrival rate of incoming relevant publications per subscription is predefined; and doesnot depend on the publication rate. Since all relevant objects (ie publications in our case) …,Proceedings of the second international conference on Distributed event-based systems,2008,40
Semantic sensor data search in a large-scale federated sensor network,Jean-Paul Calbimonte; Hoyoung Jeung; Oscar Corcho; Karl Aberer,Sensor network deployments are a primary source of massive amounts of data about thereal world that surrounds us; measuring a wide range of physical properties in real time.However; in large-scale deployments it becomes hard to eectively exploit the data capturedby the sensors; since there is no precise information about what devices are available andwhat properties they measure. Even when metadata is available; users need to know low-level details such as database schemas or names of properties that are specic to a device orplatform. Therefore the task of coherently searching; correlating and combining sensor databecomes very challenging. We propose an ontology-based approach; that consists inexposing sensor observations in terms of ontologies enriched with semantic metadata;providing information such as: which sensor recorded what; where; when; and in which …,*,2011,39
The gist of everything new: personalized top-k processing over web 2.0 streams,Parisa Haghani; Sebastian Michel; Karl Aberer,Abstract Web 2.0 portals have made content generation easier than ever with millions ofusers contributing news stories in form of posts in weblogs or short textual snippets as inTwitter. Efficient and effective filtering solutions are key to allow users stay tuned to this ever-growing ocean of information; releasing only relevant trickles of personal interest. Inclassical information filtering systems; user interests are formulated using standard IRtechniques and data from all available information sources is filtered based on a predefinedabsolute quality-based threshold. In contrast to this restrictive approach which may stilloverwhelm the user with the returned stream of data; we envision a system whichcontinuously keeps the user updated with only the top-k relevant new information.Freshness of data is guaranteed by considering it valid for a particular time interval …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,39
Query-driven indexing for scalable peer-to-peer text retrieval,Gleb Skobeltsyn; Toan Luu; Ivana Podnar Žarko; Martin Rajman; Karl Aberer,Abstract In this paper; we present a query-driven indexing/retrieval strategy for efficient fulltext retrieval from large document collections distributed within a structured P2P network.Our indexing strategy is based on two important properties:(1) the generated distributedindex stores posting lists for carefully chosen indexing term combinations that are frequentlypresent in user queries; and (2) the posting lists containing too many document referencesare truncated to a bounded number of their top-ranked elements. These two propertiesguarantee acceptable latency and bandwidth requirements; essentially because the numberof indexing term combinations remains scalable and the posting lists transmitted duringretrieval never exceed a constant size. A novel index update mechanism efficiently handlesadding of new documents to the document collection. Thus; the generated distributed …,Future Generation Computer Systems,2009,39
Sensor metadata management and its application in collaborative environmental research,Nicholas Dawes; K Ashwin Kumar; Sebastian Michel; Karl Aberer; Michael Lehning,This paper considers metadata generation and tracking in a collaborative environmentwhere users publish raw sensor data in the form of virtual sensors and post-process data bymeans of filtering; modeling; or query processing techniques. In the metadata systemdescribed; data from different sources with different provenance will be enriched with furthermetadata at each processing step to describe the processing implemented and/orobservations which may explain anomalies in the data. The management of this data is thesubject of this paper. In the context of sensor data processing; in particular in theenvironmental sciences; there is still a large gap between data acquisition and metadatagathering; further complicated by the problem of combining both. In this paper; an attempt ismade to bridge the gap between data management and semantic annotation. This paper …,eScience; 2008. eScience'08. IEEE Fourth International Conference on,2008,39
It was easy; when apples and blackberries were only fruits,Surender Reddy Yerva; Zoltán Miklós; Karl Aberer,Abstract. Ambiguities in company names are omnipresent. This is not accidental; companiesdeliberately chose ambiguous brand names; as part of their marketing and brandingstrategy. This procedure leads to new challenges; when it comes to finding informationabout the company on the Web. This paper is concerned with the task of classifying Twittermessages; whether they are related to a given company: for example; we classify a set oftwitter messages containing a keyword apple; whether a message is related to the companyApple Inc. Our technique is essentially an SVM classifier; which uses a simplerepresentation of relevant and irrelevant information in the form of keywords; grouped inspecific “profiles”. We developed a simple technique to construct such classifiers forpreviously unseen companies; where no training set is available; by training the meta …,*,2010,38

In this paper; we introduce a structured framework and adiscriminative index that can be used to segment the consumption data along multiplecontextual dimensions such as locations; communities; seasons; weather patterns; holidays;etc. The generated segments can enable various higher-level applications such as usage-specific tariff structures; theft detection; consumer-specific demand response programs; etc.Our framework is also able to track consumers' behavioral changes; evaluate differenttemporal aggregations; and identify main characteristics which define a cluster.,*,2014,37
User-side adaptive protection of location privacy in participatory sensing,Berker Agir; Thanasis G Papaioannou; Rammohan Narendula; Karl Aberer; Jean-Pierre Hubaux,Abstract The participatory sensing paradigm; through the growing availability of cheapsensors in mobile devices; enables applications of great social and business interest; eg;electrosmog exposure measurement and early earthquake detection. However; users'privacy concerns regarding their activity traces need to be adequately addressed as well.The existing static privacy-enabling approaches; which hide or obfuscate data; offer someprotection at the expense of data value. These approaches do not offer privacy guaranteesand heterogeneous user privacy requirements cannot be met by them. In this paper; wepropose a user-side privacy-protection scheme; it adaptively adjusts its parameters; in orderto meet personalized location-privacy protection requirements against adversaries in ameasurable manner.

Utility-driven data acquisition in participatory sensing,Mehdi Riahi; Thanasis G Papaioannou; Immanuel Trummer; Karl Aberer,Abstract Participatory sensing (PS) is becoming a popular data acquisition means forinteresting emerging applications. However; as data queries from these applicationsincrease; the sustainability of this platform for multiple concurrent applications is at stake. Inthis paper; we consider the problem of efficient data acquisition in PS when queries ofdifferent types come from different applications. We effectively deal with the issues related toresource constraints; user privacy; data reliability; and uncontrolled mobility. We formulatethe problem as multi-query optimization and propose efficient heuristics for its effectivesolution for the various query types and mixes that enable sustainable sensing. Based onsimulations with real and artificial data traces; we found that our heuristic algorithmsoutperform baseline approaches in a multitude of settings considered.,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,37
Effective metadata management in federated sensor networks,Hoyoung Jeung; Sofiane Sarni; Ioannis Paparrizos; Saket Sathe; Karl Aberer; Nicholas Dawes; Thanasis G Papaioannou; Michael Lehning,As sensor networks become increasingly popular; heterogeneous sensor networks arebeing interconnected into federated sensor networks and provide huge volumes of sensordata to large user communities for a variety of applications. Effective metadata managementplays a crucial role in processing and properly interpreting raw sensor measurement data;and needs to be performed in a collaborative fashion. Previous data management work hasconcentrated on metadata and data as two separate entities and has not provided specificsupport for joint real-time processing of metadata and sensor data. In this paper we proposea framework that allows effective sensor data and metadata management based on real-time metadata creation and join processing over federated sensor networks.

To minimize network traffic; we process queries in an incremental top-K fashionleveraging on a locality preserving mapping to the peer space.

Towards peer-to-peer double auctioning,Zoran Despotovic; J-C Usunier; Karl Aberer,P2P systems constitute nowadays an increasingly important part of the online world thatneeds or will soon need all kinds of e-commerce services and applications that are normallyavailable today on client-server platforms. When designing new e-commerce solutions inP2P; particular attention must be paid to masking autonomy of the peers and the lack of anycentral authorities as two most important problems. In this paper; we explore possibilities tobring e-commerce into P2P and propose a double auctioning mechanism that does not relyon the existence of central authorities; auctioneer in particular; and is amenable toimplementation in P2P environments. The mechanism has good economic properties suchas; for example; fast convergence towards efficient trading through intuitive and simplebidding strategies.,System Sciences; 2004.

The quest for balancing peer load in structured peer-to-peer systems,Karl Aberer; Anwitaman Datta; Manfred Hauswirth,Abstract Structured peer-to-peer (P2P) systems are considered as the next generationapplication backbone on the Internet. An important problem of these systems is loadbalancing in the presence of non-uniform data distributions. In this paper we propose acompletely decentralized mechanism that in parallel addresses a local and a global loadbalancing problem:(1) balancing the storage load uniformly among peers participating in thenetwork and (2) uniformly replicating different data items in the network while optimallyexploiting existing storage capacity. Our approach is based on the P-Grid P2P system whichis our variant of a structured P2P network. Problem (1) is solved by directly adapting thesearch structure to the data distribution. This may result in an unbalanced search structure;but we will show that the expected search cost in P-Grid in number of messages remains …,*,2003,36
On leveraging crowdsourcing techniques for schema matching networks,Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung; Nguyen Thanh Tam; Zoltan Miklos; Karl Aberer,Abstract As the number of publicly-available datasets are likely to grow; the demand ofestablishing the links between these datasets is also getting higher and higher. For creatingsuch links we need to match their schemas. Moreover; for using these datasets inmeaningful ways; one often needs to match not only two; but several schemas. Thismatching process establishes a (potentially large) set of attribute correspondences betweenmultiple schemas that constitute a schema matching network. Various commercial andacademic schema matching tools have been developed to support this task. However; asthe matching is inherently uncertain; the heuristic techniques adopted by these tools giverise to results that are not completely correct. Thus; in practice; a post-matching humanexpert effort is needed to obtain a correct set of attribute correspondences.

Handling identity in peer-to-peer systems,Manfred Hauswirth; Anwitaman Datta; Karl Aberer,Due to the limited number of available IP addresses most computers on the Internet usedynamic IP addresses which cause problems for applications that have to maintain routingtables; for example; peer-to-peer systems. To overcome this we propose unique peeridentifiers in the routing tables and apply the peer-to-peer system itself to maintainconsistent ID-to-IP mappings to be used in the routing process. While this may sound like arecursive hen-egg problem we show that it is in fact possible to devise such a mappingservice for realistic scenarios. Our approach is completely decentralized; self-maintaining;and light-weight. It takes into account security to provide sufficient security guarantees for themappings. We also assume that the service operates in an environment with low onlineprobability of the peers constituting the service.,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 2003.

Trank: Ranking entity types using the web of data,Alberto Tonon; Michele Catasta; Gianluca Demartini; Philippe Cudré-Mauroux; Karl Aberer,Abstract Much of Web search and browsing activity is today centered around entities. Forthis reason; Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs) increasingly contain information aboutthe searched entities such as pictures; short summaries; related entities; and factualinformation. A key facet that is often displayed on the SERPs and that is instrumental formany applications is the entity type. However; an entity is usually not associated to a singlegeneric type in the background knowledge bases but rather to a set of more specific types;which may be relevant or not given the document context. For example; one can find on theLinked Open Data cloud the fact that Tom Hanks is a person; an actor; and a person fromConcord; California.

Route maintenance overheads in DHT overlays,Karl Aberer; Anwitaman Datta; Manfred Hauswirth,Abstract Efficient route maintenance in DHTs is still an area of very active research due to itscomplexity and multitude of aspects to be considered. In this paper we propose novelcorrectionon-failure (CoF) and correction-on-use (CoU) approaches that support routemaintenance more efficiently than existing methods even under highly dynamical networkconditions. In contrast to previous work which addresses static resilience; we apply the morerealistic model of viewing changes in the network as a continuous Markovian process anddemonstrate that the system can reach a dynamic equilibrium in the presence of continuouschanges while remaining operational; efficient; and scalable.

Dynamic cost-efficient replication in data clouds,Nicolas Bonvin; Thanasis G Papaioannou; Karl Aberer,Abstract Hardware failures in current data centers are common partly due to the higher datascales supported. Data replication is the common approach for improving availability.However; mostly static replication approaches have been proposed; ie the number ofreplicas and their locations are fixed. Moreover; the geographical diversity of data locationshas not explicitly been considered. In this paper; we propose a cost-efficient replicationscheme across data centers that dynamically adapts the number of replicas employed perpartition to the query load; while maintaining availability guarantees in case of failures. Ourapproach employs a virtual economy that is experimentally proved in a simulatedenvironment to achieve load balancing among data servers at the minimum cost.,Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Automated Control for Datacenters and Clouds,2009,32
A framework for decentralized ranking in web information retrieval,Karl Aberer; Jie Wu,Abstract Search engines are among the most important applications or services on the web.Most existing successful search engines use global ranking algorithms to generate theranking of documents crawled in their databases. However; global ranking of documentshas two potential problems: high computation cost and potentially poor rankings. Both of theproblems are related to the centralized computation paradigm.

Pay-as-you-go reconciliation in schema matching networks,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen; Thanh Tam Nguyen; Zoltan Miklos; Karl Aberer; Avigdor Gal; Matthias Weidlich,Schema matching is the process of establishing correspondences between the attributes ofdatabase schemas for data integration purposes. Although several automatic schemamatching tools have been developed; their results are often incomplete or erroneous. Toobtain a correct set of correspondences; a human expert is usually required to validate thegenerated correspondences. We analyze this reconciliation process in a setting where anumber of schemas needs to be matched; in the presence of consistency expectations aboutthe network of attribute correspondences. We develop a probabilistic model that helps toidentify the most uncertain correspondences; thus allowing us to guide the expert's work andcollect his input about the most problematic cases. As the availability of such experts is oftenlimited; we develop techniques that can construct a set of good quality correspondences …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,31

The complex facets of reputation and trust,Karl Aberer; Zoran Despotovic; Wojciech Galuba; Wolfgang Kellerer,Summary. Trust and reputation systems have proven to be essential to enforcingcooperative behavior in peer-to-peer networks. We briefly describe the current approachesto building reputation systems: social networks formation; probabilistic estimation; and gametheoretic models. We then observe that all of the current models make a number ofsimplifying assumptions that may not necessarily hold in real networks; such as eitherirrational (probabilistic) or completely rational behavior; instant propagation of reputationinformation and homogeneity of interactions. We argue that dropping those assumptionsand allowing more degrees of freedom is necessary in order to construct more realistic andricher reputation models. We support our argument by citing reputation research done ineconomics; evolutionary psychology; biology; and sociology; and consider models that …,*,2006,31
Probabilistic prediction of peers’ performance in p2p networks,Zoran Despotovic; Karl Aberer,Abstract The problem of encouraging trustworthy behavior in P2P online communities bymanaging peers' reputations has drawn a lot of attention recently. However; most of theproposed solutions exhibit the following two problems: huge implementation overhead andunclear trust related model semantics. This paper shows that a simple probabilistictechnique; maximum likelihood estimation namely; can reduce these two problemssubstantially when employed as the feedback aggregation strategy. We evaluate thetechnique in three settings relevant for applications of P2P networks and show that itperforms well in all of them. Thus; no complex exploration of the feedback is necessary.Instead; simple; intuitive and efficient probabilistic estimation methods suffice.,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2005,31
On small world graphs in non-uniformly distributed key spaces,Sarunas Girdzijauskas; Anwitaman Datta; Karl Aberer,In this paper we show that the topologies of most logarithmic-style P2P systems like Pastry;Tapestry or P-Grid resemble small-world graphs. Inspired by Kleinberg's small-world model[7] we extend the model of building" routing-efficient" small-world graphs and propose twonew models. We show that the graph; constructed according to our model for uniform keydistribution and logarithmic outdegree; will have similar properties as the topologies ofstructured P2P systems with logarithmic outdegree. Moreover; we propose a novel model ofbuilding graphs which support uneven node distributions and preserves all desiredproperties of Kleinberg's small-world model. With such a model we are setting a referencebase for nowadays emerging P2P systems that need to support uneven key distributions.,Data Engineering Workshops; 2005. 21st International Conference on,2005,31
Matching demand with supply in the smart grid using agent-based multiunit auction,Tri Kurniawan Wijaya; Kate Larson; Karl Aberer,Recent work has suggested reducing electricity generation cost by cutting the peak toaverage ratio (PAR) without reducing the total amount of the loads. However; most of theseproposals rely on consumer's willingness to act. In this paper; we propose an approach tocut PAR explicitly from the supply side. The resulting cut loads are then distributed amongconsumers by the means of a multiunit auction which is done by an intelligent agent onbehalf of the consumer. This approach is also in line with the future vision of the smart grid tohave the demand side matched with the supply side. Experiments suggest that our approachreduces overall system cost and gives benefit to both consumers and the energy provider.,Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS); 2013 Fifth International Conference on,2013,30
Query-load balancing in structured overlays,Anwitaman Datta; Roman Schmidt; Karl Aberer,Query-load (forwarding and answering) balancing in structured overlays is one of the mostcritical and least studied problems. It has been assumed that caching heuristics can takecare of it. We expose that caching; while necessary; is not in itself sufficient. We then providesimple and effective load-aware variants of the standard greedy routing used in overlays;exploiting routing redundancy originally needed for fault-tolerance; to achieve very goodquery load-balancing.,Cluster Computing and the Grid; 2007.

Swarm intelligent surfing in the web,Jie Wu; Karl Aberer,Abstract Traditional ranking models used in Web search engines rely on a static snapshot ofthe Web graph; basically the link structure of the Web documents. However; visitors'browsing activities indicate the importance of a document. In the traditional static models; theinformation on document importance conveyed by interactive browsing is neglected. Thenowadays Web server/surfer model lacks the ability to take advantage of user interaction fordocument ranking. We enhance the ordinary Web server/surfer model with a mechanisminspired by swarm intelligence to make it possible for the Web servers to interact with Websurfers and thus obtain a proper local ranking of Web documents. The proof-of-conceptimplementation of our idea demonstrates the potential of our model.

Thispaper explores the potential of fusing social and sensor data in the cloud; presenting apractice-a travel recommendation system that offers the predicted mood information ofpeople on where and when users wish to travel. The system is built upon a conceptualframework that allows to blend the heterogeneous social and sensor data for integratedanalysis; extracting weather-dependent people's mood information from Twitter andmeteorological sensor data streams.

Trust-aware delivery of composite goods,Zoran Despotovic; Karl Aberer,Abstract The vast majority of the interactions in typical online communities nowadays isbetween complete strangers. In such settings reputation reporting and trust managementmodels play a crucial role for proper functioning of those communities. A lot of work hasbeen done on the issues of collecting and spreading reputations and subsequentcomputation of trust. The application of such data for decision making; however; is far lessexplored. In this paper we present a solution for scheduling exchanges among participantsof an online community which takes into account their trustworthiness. In this way we canenable exchanges that would otherwise not be taking place. Thus this work alsodemonstrates that trust can in fact increase economic activity.,International Workshop on Agents and P2P Computing,2002,29
Sammple: Detecting semantic indoor activities in practical settings using locomotive signatures,Zhixian Yan; Dipanjan Chakraborty; Archan Misra; Hoyoung Jeung; Karl Aberer,We analyze the ability of mobile phone-generated accelerometer data to detect high-level(ie; at the semantic level) indoor lifestyle activities; such as cooking at home and working atthe workplace; in practical settings. We design a 2-Tier activity extraction framework (calledSAMMPLE) for our purpose. Using this; we evaluate discriminatory power of activitystructures along the dimension of statistical features and after a transformation to asequence of individual locomotive micro-activities (eg sitting or standing). Our findings from152 days of real-life behavioral traces reveal that locomotive signatures achieve an averageaccuracy of 77.14%; an improvement of 16.37% over directly using statistical features.,Wearable Computers (ISWC); 2012 16th International Symposium on,2012,27
Privacy-aware and highly-available OSN profiles,Rammohan Narendula; Thanasis G Papaioannou; Karl Aberer,The explosive growth of online social networks (OSNs) and their wide popularity suggest theimpact of OSNs on today's Internet. At the same time; concentration of vast amount ofpersonal information within a single administrative domain causes critical privacy concerns.As a result; privacy-conscious users feel dis-empowered with today's OSNs. In this paper;we report on an on-going research work and introduce a privacy-aware decentralized OSNcalled\textit {porkut}. Our system exploits trust relationships in the social network fordecentralized storage of OSN profiles and their content. By taking users' geographicallocations and online time statistics into account; it also addresses availability and storageperformance issues. We finally advocate indexing of social network content and present anapproach for indexing in a privacy-preserving manner.,Enabling Technologies: Infrastructures for Collaborative Enterprises (WETICE); 2010 19th IEEE International Workshop on,2010,27

Transparent integration of continuous media support into a multimedia DBMS,Silvia Hollfelder; Florian Schmidt; Matthias Hemmje; Karl Aberer,ABSTRACT Multimedia Database Management Systems (MMDBMS) have to efficientlyprovide the specific functionalities required by time-dependent multimedia data types.During presentation playout; this requires support for continuous data delivery and media-oriented optimization of presentation quality according to users' requirements. In this work;we describe our way to integrate this type of support transparently with other MM-DBMSfunctions like media editing and querying. This has been achieved by extending an existingdata model; in particular by means of stream abstractions for editing and presentation; andby extending the system architecture by means of supporting stream processingcomponents; eg; for intra-media synchronization by adaptation. This approach has beenimplemented as an extension of existing commercial object-relational DBMS technology.,International Workshop on Issues and Applications of Database Technology (IADT" 98),1998,27
Efficient and robust secure aggregation for sensor networks,Parisa Haghani; Panos Papadimitratos; Marcin Poturalski; Karl Aberer; Jean-Pierre Hubaux,Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) rely on in-network aggregation for efficiency; however;this comes at a price: a single adversary can severely influence the outcome by contributingan arbitrary partial aggregate value. Secure in-network aggregation can detect suchmanipulation (H. Chan et al; 2006). But as long as such faults persist; no aggregation resultcan be obtained. In contrast; the collection of individual sensor node values is robust andsolves the problem of availability; yet in an inefficient way. Our work seeks to bridge this gapin secure data collection: we propose a system that enhances availability with an efficiencyclose to that of in-network aggregation. To achieve this; our scheme relies on costlyoperations to localize and exclude nodes that manipulate the aggregation; but only when afailure is detected.

Using a layered markov model for distributed web ranking computation,Jie Wu; Karl Aberer,The link structure of the Web graph is used in algorithms such as Kleinberg's HITS andGoogle's PageRank to assign authoritative weights to Web pages and thus rank them. Bothrequire a centralized computation of the ranking if used to rank the complete Web graph. Inthis paper; we propose a new approach based on a Layered Markov Model to distinguishtransitions among Web sites and Web documents. Based on this model; we propose twodifferent approaches for computation of ranking of Web documents; a centralized one and adecentralized one. Both produce a well-defined ranking for a given Web graph. We thenformally prove that the two approaches are equivalent. This provides a theoreticalfoundation for decomposing link-based rank computation and makes the computation for aWeb-scale graph feasible in a decentralized fashion; such as required for Web search …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2005.

On de Bruijn routing in distributed hash tables: there and back again,Anwitaman Datta; Sarunas Girdzijauskas; Karl Aberer,We show in this paper that de Bruijn networks; despite providing efficient search while usingconstant routing table size; as well as simplicity of the understanding and implementation ofsuch networks; are unsuitable where key distribution will be uneven; a realistic scenario formost practical applications. In presence of arbitrarily skewed data distribution; it has onlyrecently been shown that some traditional P2P overlay networks with non-constant (typicallylogarithmic) instead of constant routing table size can meet conflicting objectives of storageload balancing as well as search efficiency. So this paper; while showing that de Bruijnnetworks fail to meet these dual objectives; opens up a more general problem for theresearch community as to whether P2P systems with constant routing table can at allachieve the conflicting objectives of retaining search efficiency as well as storage load …,Peer-to-Peer Computing; 2004.

Efficient search in unbalanced; randomized peer-to-peer search trees,Karl Aberer,Abstract Scalable mechanisms to support efficient key-based search in distributed systemsare an important part of the infrastructure of peer-to-peer systems and global informationsystems. They received substantial attention both in information and communication systemsresearch. A particularly important class of approaches is based on a principle of scalabledistribution of binary search trees that has been introduced by Plaxton [9]. When adaptingthe shape of such a tree search structure to the data distribution in order to obtain loadbalancing; the search trees may become highly unbalanced. We show that for P-Grid; aPlaxton-like distributed search structure that we first introduced in [1]; the expectedcommunication cost for searches is strictly limited by log (n) where n is the number of peers.This result is completely independent of the shape of the underlying tree.

Integrating relational and object-oriented database systems using a metaclass concept,Wolfgang Klas; Gisela Fischer; Karl Aberer,Abstract This paper presents a specific approach of integrating a relational database systeminto a federated database system. The underlying database integration process consist ofthree steps: first; the external database systems have to be connected to the integrateddatabase system environment and the external data models have to be mapped into acanonical data model. This step is often called syntactic transformation including structuralenrichment and leads to component schemas for each external DBMS. Second; the resultingschemas from the first step are used to construct export schemas which are then integratedinto global; individual schemas or views in the third step. In this paper we focus on the firststep for relational databases; ie; the connection of a relational database system and themapping of the relational model into a canonical data model.

Oscar: Small-world overlay for realistic key distributions,Sarunas Girdzijauskas; Anwitaman Datta; Karl Aberer,Abstract The research on P2P systems which support skewed key distributions has rapidlyadvanced in the recent years. Yet; the assumptions on the skews we are dealing withremained pretty simple: most of the existing literature assumes simple monotonous keydistribution skews. However; this is not always the case. For example; Gnutella filenametraces show that complex key-distributions rather than monotonous skews occur in practice.We show that one of the seminal P2P systems which support skewed keys-Mercury [7];performs poorly given such complex distributions generated from the trace of Gnutellafilenames. We discuss the shortcomings of such state-of-the-art techniques. We present anoverlay network Oscar; based on a novel overlay construction mechanism; which does notdepend on the key-distribution complexity. We demonstrate through simulations that our …,*,2007,25
A peer-to-peer architecture for information retrieval across digital library collections,Ivana Podnar; Toan Luu; Martin Rajman; Fabius Klemm; Karl Aberer,Abstract Peer-to-peer networks have been identified as promising architectural concept fordeveloping search scenarios across digital library collections. Digital libraries typically offersophisticated search over their local content; however; search methods involving a networkof such stand-alone components are currently quite limited. We present an architecture forhighly-efficient search over digital library collections based on structured P2P networks. Asthe standard single-term indexing strategy faces significant scalability limitations indistributed environments; we propose a novel indexing strategy–key-based indexing. Thekeys are term sets that appear in a restricted number of collection documents. Thus; they arediscriminative with respect to the global document collection; and ensure scalable searchcosts. Moreover; key-based indexing computes posting list joins during indexing time …,International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries,2006,25
Using siterank for decentralized computation of web document ranking,Jie Wu; Karl Aberer,Abstract The PageRank algorithm demonstrates the significance of the computation ofdocument ranking of general importance or authority in Web information retrieval. However;doing a PageRank computation for the whole Web graph is both time-consuming and costly.State of the art Web crawler based search engines also suffer from the latency in retrieving acomplete Web graph for the computation of PageRank. We look into the problem ofcomputing PageRank in a decentralized and timely fashion by making use of SiteRank andaggregating rankings from multiple sites. A SiteRank is basically the ranking generated byapplying the classical PageRank algorithm to the graph of Web sites; ie; the Web graph atthe granularity of Web sites instead of Web pages. Our empirical results show that SiteRankalso follows a power-law distribution.

Mining complex activities in the wild via a single smartphone accelerometer,Angshu Rai; Zhixian Yan; Dipanjan Chakraborty; Tri Kurniawan Wijaya; Karl Aberer,Abstract Complex activities are activities that are a combination of many simple ones.Typically; activities of daily living (ADLs) fall in this category. Complex activity recognition isan active area of interest amongst sensing and knowledge mining community today.

This resulted in many novel peer-to-peer data managementconcepts and algorithms; for supporting data management tasks in a wider sense; includingdata integration; document management and text retrieval. The lecture covers four differenttypes of peer-to-peer data management systems that are characterized by the type of datathey manage and the search capabilities they support.

Collaborative schema matching reconciliation,Hung Quoc Viet Nguyen; Xuan Hoai Luong; Zoltán Miklós; Tho Thanh Quan; Karl Aberer,Abstract Schema matching is the process of establishing correspondences between theattributes of database schemas for data integration purpose. Although several schemamatching tools have been developed; their results are often incomplete or erroneous. Toobtain correct attribute correspondences; in practice; human experts edit the mappingresults and fix the mapping problems. As the scale and complexity of data integration taskshave increased dramatically in recent years; the reconciliation phase becomes more andmore a bottleneck. Moreover; one often needs to establish the correspondences in not onlybetween two but a network of schemas simultaneously. In such reconciliation settings; it isdesirable to involve several experts.

Creating probabilistic databases from imprecise time-series data,Saket Sathe; Hoyoung Jeung; Karl Aberer,Although efficient processing of probabilistic databases is a well-established field; a widerange of applications are still unable to benefit from these techniques due to the lack ofmeans for creating probabilistic databases. In fact; it is a challenging problem to associateconcrete probability values with given time-series data for forming a probabilistic database;since the probability distributions used for deriving such probability values vary over time.

Scalable delivery of stream query result,Yongluan Zhou; Ali Salehi; Karl Aberer,Abstract Continuous queries over data streams typically produce large volumes of resultstreams. To scale up the system; one should carefully study the problem of delivering theresult streams to the end users; which; unfortunately; is often overlooked in existing systems.In this paper; we leverage Distributed Publish/Subscribe System (DPSS); a scalable datadissemination infrastructure; for efficient stream query result delivery. To take advantage ofDPSS's multicast-like data dissemination architecture; one has to exploit the commoncontents among different result streams and maximize the sharing of their delivery. Hence;we propose to merge the user queries into a few representative queries whose resultssubsume those of the original ones; and disseminate the result streams of theserepresentative queries through the DPSS.

Toward massive query optimization in large-scale distributed stream systems,Yongluan Zhou; Karl Aberer; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Existing distributed stream systems adopt a tightly-coupled communicationparadigm and focus on fine-tuning of operator placements to achieve communicationefficiency.

On routing in distributed hash tables,Fabius Klemm; Sarunas Girdzijauskas; Jean-Yves Le Boudec; Karl Aberer,There have been many proposals for constructing routing tables for distributed hash tables(DHT). They can be classified into two groups: A) those that assume that the peers areuniformly randomly distributed in the identifier space; and B) those that allow order-preserving hash functions that lead to a skewed peer distribution in the identifier space.Good solutions for group A have been known for many years. However; DHTs in group A arelimited to use randomized hashing and therefore; queries over whole identifier ranges thusdo not scale. Group B can handle such queries easily. However; it is more difficult to connectthe peers such that the resulting topology provides efficient routing; small routing tables; andbalanced routing load. We present an elegant new solution to construct an efficient DHT forgroup B. Our main idea is to decouple the identifier space from the routing topology. In …,Peer-to-Peer Computing; 2007. P2P 2007.

Mapping moving landscapes by mining mountains of logs: novel techniques for dependency model generation,Mirko Steinle; Karl Aberer; Sarunas Girdzijauskas; Christian Lovis,Abstract Problem diagnosis for distributed systems is usually difficult. Thus; an automatedsupport is needed to identify root causes of encountered problems such as performancelags or inadequate functioning quickly. The many tools and techniques existing today thatperform this task rely usually on some dependency model of the system. However; incomplex and fast evolving environments it is practically unfeasible to keep such a model up-to-date manually and it has to be created in an automatic manner. For high level objects thisis in itself a challenging and less studied task. In this paper; we propose three differentapproaches to discover dependencies by mining system logs. Our work is inspired by arecently developed data mining algorithm and techniques for collocation extraction from thenatural language processing field. We evaluate the techniques in a case study for …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,22
Beyond term indexing: A P2P framework for web information retrieval,Ivana Podnar; Martin Rajman; Toan Luu; Fabius Klemm; Karl Aberer,Web search over peer-to-peer (P2P) networks shows promise to become an alternative to thestate-of-the-art search engines since P2P overlays offer means for decentralized search acrosswidely-distributed document collections. However; the design of effective techniques for P2Pindexing and retrieval raises a number of technical challenges due to potentially unscalableresource (eg bandwidth; storage) consumption. The paper presents a framework for full-text informationretrieval in structured P2P networks and intro- duces a novel retrieval model based on highlydiscriminative keys—terms and term sets appearing in a restricted number of documents—thatensure efficient and scalable retrieval. Our goal is to design scalable techniques for buildinga global key index in structured P2P overlays for large document collections. We present experimentalresults that show acceptable indexing and retrieval costs while the retrieval quality is …,Informatica,2006,22
The impact of multimedia data on database management systems,Karl Aberer; Wolfgang Klas,Abstract This paper analyzes the impact of multimedia data on database managementsystems and proposes some solutions which allow for a high degree of integrated handlingof multimedia data by a multimedia database system. We first give a characterization ofmultimedia data with respect to issues like time dependency and amount of data. Then wederive major requirements which need to be satisfied in order to provide the integration.These requirements include eg; dynamic data management; non-transparent parallelism;scheduling; several kinds of abstractions; resource distribution transparency; and advancedinteraction models satisfying real time constraints. We show how some of the requirementscan be met by exploiting concepts from the object-oriented paradigm and database systems.Then we discuss extensions needed with respect to data integration; scheduling …,*,1992,22
Result selection and summarization for web table search,Thanh Tam Nguyen; Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen; Matthias Weidlich; Karl Aberer,The amount of information available on the Web has been growing dramatically; raising theimportance of techniques for searching the Web. Recently; Web Tables emerged as amodel; which enables users to search for information in a structured way. However; effectivepresentation of results for Web Table search requires (1) selecting a ranking of tables thatacknowledges the diversity within the search result; and (2) summarizing the informationcontent of the selected tables concisely but meaningful. In this paper; we formalize theserequirements as the diversified table selection problem and the structured tablesummarization problem. We show that both problems are computationally intractable and;thus; present heuristic algorithms to solve them. For these algorithms; we prove salientperformance guarantees; such as near-optimality; stability; and fairness.

Decentralized planning of energy demand for the management of robustness and discomfort,Evangelos Pournaras; Matteo Vasirani; Robert E Kooij; Karl Aberer,The robustness of smart grids is challenged by unpredictable power peaks or temporaldemand oscillations that can cause blackouts and increase supply costs. Planning ofdemand can mitigate these effects and increase robustness. However; the impact onconsumers in regards to the discomfort they experience as a result of improving robustnessis usually neglected. This paper introduces a decentralized agent-based approach thatquantifies and manages the tradeoff between robustness and discomfort under demandplanning. Eight selection functions of plans are experimentally evaluated using real datafrom two operational smart grids. These functions can provide different quality of servicelevels for demand-side energy self-management that capture both robustness anddiscomfort criteria.,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2014,21
Automatic construction and multi-level visualization of semantic trajectories,Zhixian Yan; Lazar Spremic; Dipanjan Chakraborty; Christine Parent; Stefano Spaccapietra; Karl Aberer,Abstract With the prevalence of GPS-embedded mobile devices; enormous amounts ofmobility data are being collected in the form of trajectory-a stream of (x; y; t) points. Suchtrajectories are of heterogeneous entities-vehicles; people; animals; parcels etc. Mostapplications primarily analyze raw trajectory data and extract geometric patterns. Real-lifeapplications however; need a far more comprehensive; semantic representation oftrajectories. This paper demonstrates the automatic construction and visualizationcapabilities of SeMiTri-a system we built that exploits 3rd party information sourcescontaining geographic information; to semantically enrich trajectories.

Towards access control aware p2p data management systems,Rammohan Narendula; Zoltán Miklós; Karl Aberer,Abstract P2P data management systems provide a scalable alternative to centralizedarchitectures. Their adoption; however; is limited by the lack of possibility to control theaccess to the resources stored in the system. We address this problem in the case ofstructured P2P networks; in particular; when the system is used in a collaborative workingenvironment. We analyze the problem assuming a simple threat model and wesystematically explore the solution possibilities. We design and compare access controlenforcement techniques which realize the desired functionality by constructing independentnetworks or by implementing access control at query or at response time.,Proceedings of the 2009 EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2009,21

Using semantic technologies; userscan specify the QoS matching model and customize the ranking of services flexiblyaccording to their preferences. The formal modeling of the discovery process as a queryexecution plan facilitates the introduction of different discovery algorithms and the automaticgeneration of parallelized matchmaking evaluations.

Combining pat-trees and signature files for query evaluation in document databases,Yangjun Chen; Karl Aberer,Abstract In this paper; a new indexing technique to support the query evaluation indocument databases is proposed. The key idea of the method is the combination of thetechnique of pat-trees with signature files. While the signature files are built to expedite thetraversal of object hierarchies; the pat-trees are constructed to speed up both the signaturefile searching and the text scanning. In this way; high performance can be achieved.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,1999,21
Minimizing human effort in reconciling match networks,Hung Quoc Viet Nguyen; Tri Kurniawan Wijaya; Zoltán Miklós; Karl Aberer; Eliezer Levy; Victor Shafran; Avigdor Gal; Matthias Weidlich,Abstract Schema and ontology matching is a process of establishing correspondencesbetween schema attributes and ontology concepts; for the purpose of data integration.Various commercial and academic tools have been developed to support this task. Thesetools provide impressive results on some datasets. However; as the matching is inherentlyuncertain; the developed heuristic techniques give rise to results that are not completelycorrect. In practice; post-matching human expert effort is needed to obtain a correct set ofcorrespondences. We study this post-matching phase with the goal of reducing the costlyhuman effort. We formally model this human-assisted phase and introduce a process ofmatching reconciliation that incrementally leads to identifying the correct correspondences.We achieve the goal of reducing the involved human effort by exploiting a network of …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2013,20
Effective consumption scheduling for demand-side management in the smart grid using non-uniform participation rate,Tri Kurniawan Wijaya; Thanasis G Papaioannou; Xin Liu; Karl Aberer,Periods of peak consumer demand in today's electricity sector are expensive to satisfy andcan be the source of power failures. One possible solution is the use of demand-sidemanagement (DSM) applying dynamic pricing mechanisms. However; instead of reducingpeak loads; these mechanisms can lead to peak-shifting due to the herding effect ofconsumers' load-shifting behavior. To overcome this problem; we explore strategies ofassigning (non-uniform) participation rates to consumers. We use a generic method to find anear-optimal distribution setting for participation rates. Our method allows DSM designers totune the system toward consumer convenience. This means less frequent consumptionschedule changes; in the price of system performance. In addition; consumers do not needto reveal their detailed consumption schedules (hence; their privacy is preserved). Using …,Sustainable Internet and ICT for Sustainability (SustainIT); 2013,2013,20
A decentralized online social network with efficient user-driven replication,Rammohan Narendula; Thanasis G Papaioannou; Karl Aberer,Unprecedented growth of online social networks (OSNs) increasingly makes privacyadvocates and government agencies worrisome alike.

Cost-efficient and differentiated data availability guarantees in data clouds,Nicolas Bonvin; Thanasis G Papaioannou; Karl Aberer,Failures of any type are common in current datacenters. As data scales up; its availabilitybecomes more complex; while different availability levels per application or per data itemmay be required. In this paper; we propose a self-managed key-value store that dynamicallyallocates the resources of a data cloud to several applications in a cost-efficient and fair way.Our approach offers and dynamically maintains multiple differentiated availabilityguarantees to each different application despite failures. We employ a virtual economy;where each data partition acts as an individual optimizer and chooses whether to migrate;replicate or remove itself based on net benefit maximization regarding the utility offered bythe partition and its storage and maintenance cost.

Congestion control for distributed hash tables,Fabius Klemm; J-Y Le Boudec; Karl Aberer,Distributed hash tables (DHTs) provide a scalable mechanism for mapping identifiers tosocket addresses. As each peer in the network can initiate lookup requests; a DHT has toprocess concurrently a potentially very large number of requests. In this paper; we look atcongestion control for DHTs. Our goal is to control the flow of lookup requests that are routedin the overlay network. We first show that congestion control is essential for certainapplications with high lookup rates. We then present two congestion control mechanisms forDHTs and compare their performances in different network conditions,Network Computing and Applications; 2006. NCA 2006.

Semantic gossiping,Karl Aberer; Manfred Hauswirth,Abstract We state that the problem of semantic interoperability in information search on theInternet is solved today mostly by means of centralization; both at a system and at a logicallevel. A new brand of system architectures; peerto-peer systems; indicates that the principleof decentralization might lead to solutions to many problems that scale well to very largenumbers of users. In this position statement we develop a scenario of how decentralizationcould be working for addressing the problem of information search at a global scale. In thisscenario we extend the architecture of a well-known peer-to-peer file sharing system;namely Gnutella; to a peer-to-peer information sharing system enabling semanticinteroperability that is driven in a bottom-up manner by the participating peers. Such asystem could readily be used in order to study semantic interoperability as a global scale …,Database and Information Systems Research for Semantic Web and Enterprises; Invitational Workshop Sponsored by NSF CISE-IIS-IDM,2002,20

In this context; RDF StreamProcessing (RSP) and Stream Reasoning (SR) have emerged as solutions to combinesemantic technologies with stream and event processing techniques. Research in theseareas has proposed an ecosystem of solutions to query; reason and perform real-timeprocessing over heterogeneous and distributed data streams on the Web.

Symbolic representation of smart meter data,Tri Kurniawan Wijaya; Julien Eberle; Karl Aberer,Abstract Currently smart meter data analytics has received enormous attention because itallows utility companies to analyze customer consumption behavior in real time. However;the amount of data generated by these sensors is very large. As a result; analytics performedon top of it become very expensive. Furthermore; smart meter data contains very detailedenergy consumption measurement which can lead to customer privacy breach and all risksassociated with it. In this work; we address the problem on how to reduce smart meter datanumerosity and its detailed measurement while maintaining its analytics accuracy.

PicShark: mitigating metadata scarcity through large-scale P2P collaboration,Philippe Cudré-Mauroux; Adriana Budura; Manfred Hauswirth; Karl Aberer,Abstract With the commoditization of digital devices; personal information and media sharingis becoming a key application on the pervasive Web. In such a context; data annotationrather than data production is the main bottleneck. Metadata scarcity represents a majorobstacle preventing efficient information processing in large and heterogeneouscommunities. However; social communities also open the door to new possibilities foraddressing local metadata scarcity by taking advantage of global collections of resources.We propose to tackle the lack of metadata in large-scale distributed systems through acollaborative process leveraging on both content and metadata.

Quality-aware similarity assessment for entity matching in Web data,Surender Reddy Yerva; Zoltán Miklós; Karl Aberer,Abstract One of the key challenges to realize automated processing of the information on theWeb; which is the central goal of the Semantic Web; is related to the entity matchingproblem. There are a number of tools that reliably recognize named entities; such aspersons; companies; geographic locations; in Web documents. The names of theseextracted entities are; however; non-unique; the same name on different Web pages mightor might not refer to the same entity. The entity matching problem concerns of identifying theentities; which are referring to the same real-world entity. This problem is very similar to theentity resolution problem studied in relational databases; however; there are also severaldifferences. Most importantly Web pages often only contain partial or incomplete informationabout the entities. Similarity functions try to capture the degree of belief about the …,Information Systems,2012,18
What have fruits to do with technology?: the case of orange; blackberry and apple,Surender Reddy Yerva; Zoltán Miklós; Karl Aberer,Abstract Twitter is a micro-blogging service on the Web; where people can enter shortmessages; which then become visible to other users of the service. While the topics of thesemessages varies; there are a lot of messages where the users express their opinions aboutcompanies or products. Since the twitter service is very popular; the messages form a richsource of information for companies. They can learn with the help of data mining andsentiment analysis techniques; how their customers like their products or what is the generalperception of the company. There is however a great obstacle for analyzing the data directly:as the company names are often ambiguous; one needs first to identify; which messages arerelated to the company. In this paper we address this question.

Towards probabilistic estimation of quality of online services,Le-Hung Vu; Karl Aberer,Accurate estimation of quality of online services is both an important and difficult problem;since a service has many interdependent quality attributes influenced by several contextualfactors. It is even more challenging as quality ratings come from sources with unknownreliability; each source may rate a service on different quality aspects. Although severalsolutions have been proposed; there is little work addressing all these issues thoroughly. Inthis paper; we show that domain knowledge on service structure and related constraints;such as causal dependencies among quality attributes and contextual factors; while widelyavailable; can be exploited to effectively address the above issues in a theoretically-soundframework. Theoretical analysis shows that computational cost of the approach isacceptable; and accurate evaluation of service quality requires a reasonable number of …,Web Services; 2009. ICWS 2009.

Aggregation of a term vocabulary for P2P-IR: A DHT stress test,Fabius Klemm; Karl Aberer,Abstract There has been an increasing research interest in developing full-text retrievalbased on peer-to-peer (P2P) technology. So far; these research efforts have largelyconcentrated on efficiently distributing an index. However; ranking of the results retrievedfrom the index is a crucial part in information retrieval. To determine the relevance of adocument to a query; ranking algorithms use collection-wide statistics. Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF); for example; is based on frequencies of documentscontaining a given term in the whole collection. Such global frequencies are not readilyavailable in a distributed system. In this paper; we study the feasibility of aggregating globalfrequencies for a large term vocabulary in a P2P setting. We use a distributed hash table(DHT) for our analysis. Traditional applications of DHTs; such as file sharing; index keys …,*,2007,18

Possibilities for managing trust in P2P networks,Zoran Despotovic; Karl Aberer,Abstract Reputation systems offer a viable solution to the old problem of encouragingtrustworthy behavior in online communities. Their key presumptions are that the participantsof an online community engage in repeated interactions and that the information about theirpast doings is informative of their future performance and as such will influence it. Thus;collecting; processing; and disseminating the feedback about the participants' past behavioris expected to boost their trustworthiness. We investigate and classify the possibilitiesappeared so far in the literature to do this in the context of P2P networks.

Top-kw publish/subscribe: A publish/subscribe model for continuous top-k processing over data streams,Krešimir Pripužić; Ivana Podnar Žarko; Karl Aberer,Abstract Continuous processing of top-k queries over data streams is a promising techniquefor alleviating the information overload problem as it distinguishes relevant from irrelevantdata stream objects with respect to a given scoring function over time. Thus it enablesfiltering of irrelevant data objects and delivery of top-k objects relevant to user interests inreal-time. We propose a solution for distributed continuous top-k processing based on thepublish/subscribe communication paradigm—top-k publish/subscribe over sliding windows(top-k/w publish/subscribe). It identifies k best-ranked objects with respect to a given scoringfunction over a sliding window of size w; and extends the publish/subscribe communicationparadigm by continuous top-k processing algorithms coming from the field of data streamprocessing.

Towards online multi-model approximation of time series,Thanasis G Papaioannou; Mehdi Riahi; Karl Aberer,The increasing use of sensor technology for various monitoring applications (eg air-pollution; traffic; climate-change; etc.) has led to an unprecedented volume of streaming datathat has to be efficiently aggregated; stored and retrieved. Real-time model-based dataapproximation and filtering is a common solution for reducing the storage (andcommunication) overhead. However; the selection of the most efficient model depends onthe characteristics of the data stream; namely rate; burstiness; data range; etc.; which cannotbe always known a priori for (mobile) sensors and they can even dynamically change. In thispaper; we investigate the innovative concept of efficiently combining multiple approximationmodels in real-time.

In particular; a collaborative environmentwith personalized access to information is needed; which supports strongly varyinginformation needs of the users. This scenario is not fully supported by existing systems. Forexample; content management systems do not support personalized access to content.Social bookmarking systems are not sufficiently specific in user groups; thus; they misscontext information of the bookmarks and introduce imprecision and noise. In this paper wepropose to combine a collaborative content management system (wiki) with the socialbookmarking idea.

We endeavor to extend XSLT to accommodate the separation of processinformation from the data structure and presentation. We support declarative design furtherby a language designed to concisely specify information commerce processes.

It has to providehypermedia-document access methods. Finally; it has to allow the exchange of hypermediadocuments with other systems. On a technical level; an object-oriented database-management system; on a logical level; a well established ISO standard; namely HyTime; isused to satisfy the requirements mentioned above.

However; given a newapplication; it is difficult for users to choose the best-suited technique as well as appropriateparameter values since each of these techniques has distinct performance characteristicsdepending on various factors (eg worker expertise; question difficulty). In this paper; wedevelop a benchmarking tool that allows to (i) simulate the crowd and (ii) evaluateaggregate techniques in different aspects (accuracy; sensitivity to spammers; etc.). Webelieve that this tool will be able to serve as a practical guideline for both researchers and …,Proceedings of the 36th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2013,16

Structured overlay for heterogeneous environments: Design and evaluation of oscar,Šarūnas Girdzijauskas; Anwitaman Datta; Karl Aberer,Abstract Recent years have seen advances in building large Internet-scale index structures;generally known as structured overlays. Early structured overlays realized distributed hashtables (DHTs) which are ill suited for anything but exact queries. The need to support rangequeries necessitates systems that can handle uneven load distributions. However suchsystems suffer from practical problems—including poor latency; disproportionate bandwidthusage at participating peers; or unrealistic assumptions on peers' homogeneity; in terms ofavailable storage or bandwidth resources. In this article we consider a system that is not onlyable to support uneven load distributions but also to operate in heterogeneousenvironments; where each peer can autonomously decide how much of its resources tocontribute to the system. We provide the theoretical foundations of realizing such a …,ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems (TAAS),2010,16
A probabilistic framework for decentralized management of trust and quality,Le-Hung Vu; Karl Aberer,Abstract In this paper; we propose a probabilistic framework targeting three important issuesin the computation of quality and trust in decentralized systems. Specifically; our approachaddresses the multi-dimensionality of quality and trust; taking into account credibility of thecollected data sources for more reliable estimates; while also enabling the personalizationof the computation. We use graphical models to represent peers' qualitative behaviors andexploit appropriate probabilistic learning and inference algorithms to evaluate their qualityand trustworthiness based on related reports. Our implementation of the frameworkintroduces the most typical quality models; uses the Expectation-Maximization algorithm tolearn their parameters; and applies the Junction Tree algorithm to inference on them for theestimation of quality and trust. The experimental results validate the advantages of our …,International Workshop on Cooperative Information Agents,2007,16
Building a hybrid database application for structured documents,Klemens Böhm; Karl Aberer; Wolfgang Klas,Abstract In this article; we propose a database-internal representation for SGML-/HyTime-documents based on object-oriented database technology with the following features:documents of arbitrary type can be administered. The semantics of architectural forms isreflected by means of methods that are part of the database schema and by the database-internal representation of HyTime-specific characteristics. The framework includesmechanisms to ensure conformance of documents to the HyTime standard. Measures forimproved performance of HyTime operations are also described. The database-internalrepresentation of documents is a hybrid between a completely structured and a flatrepresentation. Namely; the structured representation is better to support the HyTimesemantics; and modifications of document components. On the other hand; most …,Multimedia Tools and Applications,1999,16
DRSim: A cyber physical simulator for Demand Response systems,Tri Kurniawan Wijaya; Dipyaman Banerjee; Tanuja Ganu; Dipanjan Chakraborty; Sourav Battacharya; Thanasis Papaioannou; Deva P Seetharam; Karl Aberer,Demand Response (DR) is a mechanism in which electricity consumers alter their demandin response to power grid's supply and economic conditions. DR programs have thepotential to improve resource efficiency; sustainability; grid reliability and economic viabilityby providing tighter alignment between demand and supply. However; implementing DRprogram is a non-trivial task as it requires good knowledge of electricity consumptionpreferences; economic models and contextual factors. Developing such knowledge throughreal world studies can be expensive and be time consuming. As a result; utility companieshave been finding it complicated to analyze potential viability and return on investments ofDR programs for variouswhat-if'scenarios. To address this problem; we present DRSim-acyber-physical simulator that allows utility companies to study demand side participation …,Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm); 2013 IEEE International Conference on,2013,15
Sustainable energy consumption monitoring in residential settings,SN Akshay Uttama Nambi; Thanasis G Papaioannou; Dipanjan Chakraborty; Karl Aberer,The continuous growth of energy needs and the fact that unpredictable energy demand ismostly served by unsustainable (ie fossil-fuel) power generators have given rise to thedevelopment of Demand Response (DR) mechanisms for flattening energy demand.Building effective DR mechanisms and user awareness on power consumption cansignificantly benefit from fine-grained monitoring of user consumption at the appliance level.However; installing and maintaining such a monitoring infrastructure in residential settingscan be quite expensive. In this paper; we study the problem of fine-grained appliance power-consumption monitoring based on one house-level meter and few plug-level meters. Weexplore the trade-off between monitoring accuracy and cost; and exhaustively find theminimum subset of plug-level meters that maximize accuracy.

Optimos: Optimal sensing for mobile sensors,Zhixian Yan; Julien Eberle; Karl Aberer,Both sensor coverage maximization and energy cost minimization are the fundamentalrequirements in the design of real-life mobile sensing applications; eg;(1) deployingenvironmental sensors (like CO 2; fine particle measurement) on public transports to monitorair pollution;(2) analyzing smart phone embedded sensors (like GPS; accelerometer) torecognize people daily activities. However sensor coverage and energy cost contradict eachother: the higher frequency mobile sensing takes; the more energy is used; and vise versa.In this paper; we design a novel two-step mobile sensing process (" OptiMoS") to achieveoptimal mobile sensing that can effectively balance sensor coverage and energy cost. In thefirst step; OptiMoS divides the continuous mobile sensor readings into several segments;where the readings in one segment are highly-correlated rather than readings amongst …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2012 IEEE 13th International Conference on,2012,15
Towards integrated and efficient scientific sensor data processing: a database approach,Ji Wu; Yongluan Zhou; Karl Aberer; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract In this work; we focus on managing scientific environmental data; which aremeasurement readings collected from wireless sensors. In environmental scienceapplications; raw sensor data often need to be validated; interpolated; aligned andaggregated before being used to construct meaningful result sets. Due to the lack of asystem that integrates all the necessary processing steps; scientists often resort to multipletools to manage and process the data; which can severely affect the efficiency of their work.In this paper; we propose a new data processing framework; HyperGrid; to address theproblem. HyperGrid adopts a generic data model and a generic query processing andoptimization framework. It offers an integrated environment to store; query; analyze andvisualize scientific datasets.

From Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 and back-: how did your grandma use to tag?,Sheila Kinsella; Adriana Budura; Gleb Skobeltsyn; Sebastian Michel; John G Breslin; Karl Aberer,Abstract We consider the applicability of terms extracted from anchortext as a source of Webpage descriptions in the form of tags. With a relatively simple and easy-to-use method; weshow that anchortext significantly overlaps with tags obtained from the popular taggingportal del. icio. us. Considering the size and diversity of the user community potentiallyinvolved in social tagging; this observation is rather surprising. Furthermore; we show by anevaluation using human-created relevance assessments the general suitability of theanchortext tag generation in terms of user-perceived precision values. The awareness of thiseasy-to-obtain source of tags could trigger the rise of new tagging portals pushed by thisautomatic bootstrapping process or be applied in already existing portals to increase thenumber of tags per page by merely looking at the anchortext which exists anyway.,Proceedings of the 10th ACM workshop on Web information and data management,2008,15
A cloud-based eHealth architecture for privacy preserving data integration,Alevtina Dubovitskaya; Visara Urovi; Matteo Vasirani; Karl Aberer; Michael I Schumacher,Abstract In this paper; we address the problem of building an anonymized medical databasefrom multiple sources. Our proposed solution defines how to achieve data integration in aheterogeneous network of many clinical institutions; while preserving data utility andpatients' privacy. The contribution of the paper is twofold: Firstly; we propose a secure andscalable cloud eHealth architecture to store and exchange patients' data for the treatment.Secondly; we present an algorithm for efficient aggregation of the health data for theresearch purposes from multiple sources independently.,IFIP International Information Security Conference,2015,14
Continuous query evaluation over distributed sensor networks,Oana Jurca; Sebastian Michel; Alexandre Herrmann; Karl Aberer,In this paper we address the problem of processing continuous multi-join queries; overdistributed data streams. Our approach makes use of existing work in the field ofpublish/subscribe systems. We show how these principles can be ported to our envisionedarchitectural model by enriching the common query model with location dependentattributes. We allow users to subscribe to a set of sensor attributes; a service that requiresprocessing multi-join correlation queries. The goal is to decrease the overall network trafficconsumption by removing redundant subscriptions and eliminating unrequested eventsclose to the publishing sensors. This is non-trivial; especially in the presence of multi-joinqueries without any central control mechanism. Our approach is based on the concept offilter-split-forward phases for efficient subscription filtering and placement inside the …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,14

As ashowcase scenario we consider tag prediction in community-based Web 2.0 taggingapplications. Experiments using real-world data demonstrate the viability of our approach inlarge-scale environments where tags are scarce.

Resource prediction and admission control for interactive video,Karl Aberer; Silvia Hollfelder,Abstract Highly interactive multimedia applications; like browsing in video databases;generate strongly varying loads on the media server during the presentation of media data.Existing admission control approaches for limiting the number of concurrent users and thusguaranteeing acceptable service quality are only suited for applications with uniform loadcharacteristics like videoon-demand. We propose a session-oriented approach to admissioncontrol that is based on the stochastical model of Continuous Time Markov Chains; whichallows to describe the different presentation states occurring in the interactive access to themultimedia database. The model is derived from semantic information on the forthcomingbrowsing session. In particular; it considers the relevance of the videos to the user. In thisway a more precise prediction on resource usage can be given for achieving the two …,*,1999,14
An admission control framework for applications with variable consumption rates in client-pull architectures,Silvia Hollfelder; Karl Aberer,Abstract Highly interactive multimedia applications require variable data rates during theirpresentation. Current admission control mechanisms do not address the variable data raterequirements appropriately for the following reasons:(1) classical admission controlmechanisms are based on the server-push approach; where the required data rate has to beestimated in advance; and (2) worst-case resource reservation is not economic. Client-pullmodels are more appropriate to serve these kinds of applications. At the current state; thereare no suitable mechanisms that support admission control in client-pull architectures at theserver. In this paper; a session-oriented framework for admission control is introduced that isbased on two steps:(1) the admission of new clients and (2) the scheduling of the singlerequests of admitted clients to balance the load. The goal of this approach is to improve …,International Workshop on Multimedia Information Systems,1998,14
Constituting a Receptor-Ligand Database from Quality-Enriched Data,Klemens Hemm; Karl Aberer; Manfred Hendlich,Abstract Many different resources are needed for analyzing relevant experimental data indrug design. Currently this data is difficult to access; because it is stored in heterogeneousdatabases; spread over many platforms; poorly interconnected; incomplete; erroneous; orjust not electronically available. In order to establish a high quality database for drug designwe have developed a new demand-driven methodology for integrating and semanticallyenriching heterogeneous data from different research areas and for migrating the data intoan object-oriented database management system. In this way we have established adatabase containing well-prepared; relevant data needed for drug design and offering theadvantages of modern database technology; like a comprehensive objectoriented datamodel; a flexible declarative query language and support for persistent storage and …,Proceedings of the International Conference on Intelligent Systems in Molecular Biology (ISMB)" 95,1995,14
The use of object-oriented data models for biomolecular databases,Karl Aberer,New biochemical and computational methods have led to an explosion in the availablebiomolecular data. Thus the management of large databases has become one of theimportant applications of computational tools in biomolecular research. From a datamanagement viewpoint the main difficulties in managing biomolecular data are related onlyto a minor degree to the quantity of available data. Databases of much larger sizes arecommon in many application areas. The challenge is to deal with the complexity of the datawith respect to the data structures; integrity constraints and algorithms. Thus conventionaldata management approaches; like file–based data management or relational databasemanagement systems; are not able to deal adequately with the typical requirements ofbiomolecular data management in general; despite of the fact that they are frequentely …,Proceedings of the Conference on Object-Oriented Computing in the Natural Sciences (OOCNS" 94),1995,14
Administering structured documents in digital libraries,Klemens Böhm; Karl Aberer; Erich Neuhold,The exponential growth in the amount of published information has led to a crisis in many oftoday's libraries. On the one hand the choice of what to keep; even in a limited field; isbecoming harder and harder; on the other hand the selection of relevant information for aspecific library user also becomes more difficult. The old idea that a library provides itsreaders with the right information in the right amount for an acceptable price at the right timeis about to fail. In a nutshell; a solution to these problems can be seen in transforming thecontents of a library to digitalized electronic form and thus gaining advantages in producing;selecting; storing and offering information. However; next to the growth in the amount ofinformation two other phenomena have occurred. The information to be handled by librariesis increasingly becoming multimedia.

Object-oriented query processing: The impact of methods on language; architecture and optimization,Karl Aberer; Gisela Fischer,Abstract Although nearly all object-oriented data models proposed so far include behavioralaspects; most objectoriented query languages; algebras and query optimization strategiessimply adapt relational concepts since they focus on the complex structures of objects andneglect the behavior. We claim that this approach is not sufficient since it does not reflect themuch richer semantics methods can carry which have to be taken into account for reallyefficient query processing. The quite straightforward approach we consider is to integratemethods in an algebraic framework for query processing and to make there partialknowledge about methods available in the form of equivalences. We examine two importantquestions which emerge from taking this approach. First; how is it possible to integratealgebraic set operators with methods defined in database schemas within an object …,*,1993,14
Cluster-based aggregate forecasting for residential electricity demand using smart meter data,Tri Kurniawan Wijaya; Matteo Vasirani; Samuel Humeau; Karl Aberer,While electricity demand forecasting literature has focused on large; industrial; and nationaldemand; this paper focuses on short-term (1 and 24 hour ahead) electricity demandforecasting for residential customers at the individual and aggregate level. Since electricityconsumption behavior may vary between households; we first build a feature universe; andthen apply Correlation-based Feature Selection to select features relevant to eachhousehold. Additionally; smart meter data can be used to obtain aggregate forecasts withhigher accuracy using the so-called Cluster-based Aggregate Forecasting (CBAF) strategy;ie; by first clustering the households; forecasting the clusters' energy consumptionseparately; and finally aggregating the forecasts. We found that the improvement providedby CBAF depends not only on the number of clusters; but also more importantly on the …,Big Data (Big Data); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,13

A query-adaptive partial distributed hash table for peer-to-peer systems,Fabius Klemm; Anwitaman Datta; Karl Aberer,Abstract The two main approaches to find data in peer-to-peer (P2P) systems areunstructured networks using flooding and structured networks using a distributed index. Adistributed index is usually built over all keys that are stored in the network whether they arequeried or not. Indexing all keys is no longer feasible when indexing metadata; as the keyspace becomes very large. Here we need a query-adaptive approach that indexes only keysworth indexing; ie keys that are queried at least with a certain frequency. In this paper westudy the cost of indexing and propose a query-adaptive partial distributed hash table(PDHT) that does not keep all keys in the index. We model and analyze a scenario to showthat query-adaptive partial indexing outperforms pure flooding and “index-everything”strategies. Furthermore; our scheme is able to automatically adjust the index to changing …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2004,13
Efficient search in structured peer-to-peer systems: Binary vs k-ary unbalanced tree structures,Magdalena Punceva; Karl Aberer,Abstract We investigate the search cost in terms of number of messages generated forrouting queries in tree-based P2P structured systems including binary and k-ary treestructures with different arities and different degrees of imbalance in the tree shape. Thiswork is motivated by the fact that k-ary balanced tree access structures can greatly reducethe number of hops for searching compared to the binary trees. We study to what extent thesame fact is true when the tree-like structures for access in P2P environments areunbalanced. Another important issue related to P2P environments is how to build thesestructures in a self-organizing way. We propose a mechanism for constructing k-ary treebased decentralized access structure in a self-organizing way and based on localinteractions only. The ability to search efficiently also on unbalanced k-ary trees opens …,International Workshop on Databases; Information Systems; and Peer-to-Peer Computing,2003,13

Efficient indexing and query processing of model-view sensor data in the cloud,Tian Guo; Thanasis G Papaioannou; Karl Aberer,Abstract As the number of sensors that pervade our lives increases (eg; environmentalsensors; phone sensors; etc.); the efficient management of massive amount of sensor data isbecoming increasingly important. The infinite nature of sensor data poses a seriouschallenge for query processing even in a cloud infrastructure. Traditional raw sensor datamanagement systems based on relational databases lack scalability to accommodate large-scale sensor data efficiently. Thus; distributed key-value stores in the cloud are becoming aprime tool to manage sensor data. Model-view sensor data management; which stores thesensor data in the form of modeled segments; brings the additional advantages of datacompression and value interpolation. However; currently there are no techniques forindexing and/or query optimization of the model-view sensor data in the cloud; full table …,Big Data Research,2014,12
Leveraging social networks for increased bittorrent robustness,Wojciech Galuba; Karl Aberer; Zoran Despotovic; Wolfgang Kellerer,In peer-to-peer content delivery systems; such as BitTorrent; there may exist nodes that arenon-cooperative and do not contribute their upload bandwidth to the system while stilldownloading content from others. The current widely used countermeasures against thisfreeriding behavior have been shown to be ineffective. In this paper; we address theproblem by leveraging the trust latent in the social networks and explicitly incorporating thesocial links as part of the BitTorrent content distribution infrastructure. Our extensive systemevaluation produces several insights. First; the social network topology alone without thetrackers is an efficient and scalable content distribution medium. Second; thanks to thecooperative social links; BitTorrent's robustness to freeriding significantly improves.

Requirements for workflow modeling in P2P-workflows derived from collaboration establishment,Andreas Wombacher; Karl Aberer,Web services advocate loosely coupled systems; although current applications are limited tocentrally controlled structures. The reason for this limitation is the lack of a method fordeciding collaboration consistency; that is deadlock freeness and boundedness; in adecentralized way. In particular; an intuitive approach classifies collaborations incorrectlybeing inconsistent due to the loss of information introduced by the decentralization. In thispaper we identify loss of message ordering and message parameter value constraintscaused by the decentralization to be the reasons for incorrect decision results. The proposedapproach to overcome this issue is to explicate these constraints; which cannot represent incommon workflow models.,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 2004.

On reputation in game theory-application to online settings,Karl Aberer; Zoran Despotovic,The phenomenon of reputation has been extensively studied in economics; game theory inparticular. The game theoretic framework for analysing reputation is that of repeated gamesin which some players are uncertain about the payoff structures of their opponents. Thereare two keyterms in this informal definition: repeated game and uncertainty. Both of them arewell in accordance with informal understanding of the notion of reputation. The necessity ofrepetition is rather obvious-it makes sense to build reputation only if it can influence futurereturns. If all interactions are one time deals then reputation is not needed because no onewill happen to know in the future what you did in the past. Uncertainty is just a little bit lessobvious: one who is locked into specific type of behavior; without any other options tochoose from; cannot have reputation for that specific type. Rather; he or she is of that type …,*,2004,12
On the efficient evaluation of relaxed queries in biological databases,Yangjun Chen; Duren Che; Karl Aberer,Abstract In this paper; a new technique is developed to support the query relaxation inbiological databases. Query relaxation is required due to the fact that queries tend not to beexpressed exactly by the users; especially in scientific databases such as biologicaldatabases; in which complex domain knowledge is heavily involved. To treat this problem;we propose the concept of the so-called fuzzy equivalence classes to capture importantkinds of domain knowledge that is used to relax queries. This concept is further integratedwith the canonical techniques for pattern searching such as the position tree and automatontheory. As a result; fuzzy queries produced through relaxation can be efficiently evaluated.This method has been successfully utilized in a practical biological database-the GPCRDB.,Proceedings of the eleventh international conference on Information and knowledge management,2002,12
A query system in a biological database,Dunren Che; Yangjun Chen; Karl Aberer,We present a query system that has been implemented in a practical biological database-GPCRDB. Distinguishing features of this system include: smart query relaxation and smoothintegration of navigation with conventional language based query functions. Queryrelaxation is required due to the fact that queries are not always effective (in other words;expected results are frequently not achieved); particularly in scientific databases likebiological databases; in which complex domain knowledge is heavily used. On the otherhand; navigation capability is desired as complex data sets are involved; especially in aWWW based environment where multiple hyperlinks are often employed. For efficientimplementation; the" fuzzy equivalence class" concept has been applied that captures animportant type of domain knowledge.,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 1999.

An oodbms-irs coupling for structured documents,Michael Volz; Karl Aberer; Klemens Böhm,Abstract Requirements of modern Hypermedia Document Systems include support forstructured documents and full DBMS and IRS functionality. 1 An objective of DBMSs is tostore and facilitate updates of highly structured and typed data. In conventional IRSs;however; documents are perceived as at. Uncertainty; on the other hand; is a principalnotion in the IRS context. In order to combine the advantages of both DBMSs and IRSs wehave coupled the IRS INQUERY with the OODBMS VODAK. To model document structure;we have chosen SGML. SGML documents are stored in the OODBMS; and additional fulltext indexing is done by the IRS. The coupling consists of OODBMS classes encapsulatingthe IRS functionality. As SGML elements are modeled by database objects in an objectoriented framework; queries can be modeled by means of methods| including content …,Data Engineering Bulletin,1996,12
An object-oriented database application for hytime document storage,Klemens Böhm; Karl Aberer,Abstract An open hypermedia-document storage system has to meet requirements that arenot satisfied by existing systems: it has to support non-generic hypermedia documenttypes1; ie document types enriched with application-specific semantics. It has to providehypermedia-document access methods. Finally; it has to allow the exchange of hypermediadocuments with other systems. On a technical level; an object-oriented database-management system; on a logical level; a well established ISO standard; namely HyTime; isused to satisfy the requirements mentioned above. By means of the example of documentsincorporating hypertext structures we discuss the impact of taking such an approach onrepresentation and processing within the database system.,Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM" 94),1994,12
C3p: Context-aware crowdsourced cloud privacy,Hamza Harkous; Rameez Rahman; Karl Aberer,Abstract Due to the abundance of attractive services available on the cloud; people areplacing an increasing amount of their data online on different cloud platforms. However;given the recent large-scale attacks on users data; privacy has become an important issue.Ordinary users cannot be expected to manually specify which of their data is sensitive; or totake appropriate measures to protect such data. Furthermore; usually most people are notaware of the privacy risk that different shared data items can pose. In this paper; we presenta novel conceptual framework in which privacy risk is automatically calculated using thesharing context of data items. To overcome ignorance of privacy risk on the part of mostusers; we use a crowdsourcing based approach.

Completeness and ambiguity of schema cover,Avigdor Gal; Michael Katz; Tomer Sagi; Matthias Weidlich; Karl Aberer; Hung Quoc Viet Nguyen; Zoltán Miklós; Eliezer Levy; Victor Shafran,Abstract Given a schema and a set of concepts; representative of entities in the domain ofdiscourse; schema cover defines correspondences between concepts and parts of theschema. Schema cover aims at interpreting the schema in terms of concepts and thus; vastlysimplifying the task of schema integration. In this work we investigate two properties ofschema cover; namely completeness and ambiguity. The former measures the part of aschema that can be covered by a set of concepts and the latter examines the amount ofoverlap between concepts in a cover. To study the tradeoffs between completeness andambiguity we define a cover model to which previous frameworks are special cases. Weanalyze the theoretical complexity of variations of the cover problem; some aim atmaximizing completeness while others aim at minimizing ambiguity.

The problem ofuntrustworthy online information is augmented by its high economic potential and itsdynamic nature; eg transient domain names; dynamic content; etc. In this paper; we addressthe problem of assessing the credibility of web pages by a decentralized socialrecommender system. Specifically; we concurrently employ i) item-based collaborativefiltering (CF) based on specific web page features; ii) user-based CF based on friend ratingsand iii) the ranking of the page in search results. These factors are appropriately combinedinto a single assessment based on adaptive weights that depend on their effectiveness fordifferent topics and different fractions of malicious ratings. Simulation experiments with realtraces of web page credibility evaluations suggest that our hybrid approach outperforms …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,11
Social and sensor data fusion in the cloud,Surender Reddy Yerva; Jonnahtan Saltarin; Hoyoung Jeung; Karl Aberer,This paper explores the potential of fusing social and sensor data in the cloud; presenting apractice-a travel recommendation system that offers the predicted mood information ofpeople on where and when users wish to travel. The system is built upon a conceptualframework that allows to blend the heterogeneous social and sensor data for integratedanalysis; extracting weather-dependant people's mood information from Twitter andmeteorological sensor data streams. In order to handle massively streaming data; thesystem employs various cloud-serving systems; such as Hadoop; HBase; and GSN. Usingthis scalable system; we performed heavy ETL as well as filtering jobs; resulting in 12 milliontweets over four months. We then derived a rich set of interesting findings through the datafusion; proving that our approach is effective and scalable; which can serve as an …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2012 IEEE 13th International Conference on,2012,11
Fuzzynet: Ringless routing in a ring-like structured overlay,Sarunas Girdzijauskas; Wojciech Galuba; Vasilios Darlagiannis; Anwitaman Datta; Karl Aberer,Abstract Many structured overlay networks rely on a ring invariant as a core networkconnectivity element. The responsibility ranges of the participating peers and navigabilityprinciples (greedy routing) heavily depend on the ring structure. For correctness guarantees;each node needs to eagerly maintain its immediate neighboring links-the ring invariant.However; the ring maintenance is an expensive task and it may not even be possible tomaintain the ring invariant continuously under high churn; particularly as the network sizegrows. Furthermore; routing anomalies in the network; peers behind firewalls and NetworkAddress Translators (NATs) create non-transitivity effects; which inevitably lead to theviolation of the ring invariant. We argue that reliance on the ring structure is a seriousimpediment for real life deployment and scalability of structured overlays. In this paper we …,Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications,2011,11
Oscar: A data-oriented overlay for heterogeneous environments,Sarunas Girdzijauskas; Anwitaman Datta; Karl Aberer,Quite a few data-oriented overlay networks have been designed in recent years. Thesedesigns often (implicitly) assume various homogeneity which seriously limit their usability inreal world. In this paper we present some performance results of the Oscar overlay; whichsimultaneously deals with heterogeneity as observed in the Internet (capacity of computers;bandwidth) as well as non-uniformity observed in data-oriented applications.,Data Engineering; 2007.

A heuristics-based approach to query optimization in structured document databases,Dunren Che; Karl Aberer,The number of documents published via the World Wide Web in the form of SGML/HTMLhas been rapidly growing for years. Efficient; declarative access mechanisms for this type ofdocument-structured documents in general-are becoming of great importance. This paperreports our most recent advance in pursuit of the effective processing and optimization ofstructured document queries; which are important for large repositories of structureddocuments. Our methodology emphasizes applying exclusively deterministictransformations on query expressions to achieve the best possible optimization efficiency. Anew approach is thus proposed that facilitates the exploitation of the DTD (document typedefinition) knowledge; structural properties and structure indices of structured documents forthe purpose of fast query optimization.,Database Engineering and Applications; 1999.

These issues are currentlytackled separately in various loosely related areas; such as workflow systems; groupware;and advanced transactional models. In the TRANSCOOP project; we have developed atransaction model and a specification language that provide a core functionality forinformation sharing in cooperative systems. The core functionality includes explicit workcoordination facilities; which at the same time ensure the consistency of results.

Contextualized ranking of entity types based on knowledge graphs,Alberto Tonon; Michele Catasta; Roman Prokofyev; Gianluca Demartini; Karl Aberer; Philippe Cudre-Mauroux,Abstract A large fraction of online queries targets entities. For this reason; Search EngineResult Pages (SERPs) increasingly contain information about the searched entities such aspictures; short summaries; related entities; and factual information. A key facet that is oftendisplayed on the SERPs and that is instrumental for many applications is the entity type.However; an entity is usually not associated to a single generic type in the backgroundknowledge graph but rather to a set of more specific types; which may be relevant or notgiven the document context. For example; one can find on the Linked Open Data cloud thefact that Tom Hanks is a person; an actor; and a person from Concord; California. All thesetypes are correct but some may be too general to be interesting (eg; person); while othermay be interesting but already known to the user (eg; actor); or may be irrelevant given …,Web Semantics: Science; Services and Agents on the World Wide Web,2016,10
ERICA: Expert guidance in validating crowd answers,Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung; Duong Chi Thang; Matthias Weidlich; Karl Aberer,Abstract Crowdsourcing became an essential tool for a broad range of Web applications.Yet; the wide-ranging levels of expertise of crowd workers as well as the presence of faultyworkers call for quality control of the crowdsourcing result. To this end; many crowdsourcingplatforms feature a post-processing phase; in which crowd answers are validated by experts.This approach incurs high costs though; since expert input is a scarce resource. To supportthe expert in the validation process; we present a tool for\emph {ExpeRt guidance Invalidating Crowd Answers (ERICA)}. It allows us to guide the expert's work by collectinginput on the most problematic cases; thereby achieving a set of high quality answers even ifthe expert does not validate the complete answer set.

Time-and space-efficient sliding window top-k query processing,Krešimir Pripužić; Ivana Podnar Žarko; Karl Aberer,Abstract A sliding window top-k (top-k/w) query monitors incoming data stream objects withina sliding window of size w to identify the k highest-ranked objects with respect to a givenscoring function over time. Processing of such queries is challenging because; even whenan object is not a top-k/w object at the time when it enters the processing system; it mightbecome one in the future. Thus a set of potential top-k/w objects has to be stored in memorywhile its size should be minimized to efficiently cope with high data streaming rates. Existingapproaches typically store top-k/w and candidate sliding window objects in a k-skyband overa two-dimensional score-time space. However; due to continuous changes of the k-skyband;its maintenance is quite costly. Probabilistic k-skyband is a novel data structure storing datastream objects from a sliding window with significant probability to become top-k/w …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2015,10
Measuring and controlling unfairness in decentralized planning of energy demand,Evangelos Pournaras; Matteo Vasirani; Robert E Kooij; Karl Aberer,Demand-side energy management improves robustness and efficiency in Smart Grids. Load-adjustment and load-shifting are performed to match demand to available supply. Theseoperations come at a discomfort cost for consumers as their lifestyle is influenced when theyadjust or shift in time their demand. Performance of demand-side energy managementmainly concerns how robustness is maximized or discomfort is minimized. However;measuring and controlling the distribution of discomfort as perceived between differentconsumers provides an enriched notion of fairness in demand-side energy managementthat is missing in current approaches. This paper defines unfairness in demand-side energymanagement and shows how unfairness is measurable and controllable by software agentsthat plan energy demand in a decentralized fashion.

Model-view sensor data management in the cloud,Tian Guo; Thanasis G Papaioannou; Karl Aberer,Infinite nature of sensor data poses a serious challenge for query processing even in a cloudinfrastructure. Model-based sensor data approximation reduces the amount of data for queryprocessing; but all modeled segments need to be scanned; in the worst case. In this paper;we propose an innovative index for modeled segments in key-value stores; namely KVI-index. KVI-index has an in-memory tree component and a secondary structure materializedin the key-value store that maps the tree nodes to the modeled data segments. Then; weintroduce a KVI-index-Scan-MapReduce hybrid approach to perform efficient queryprocessing. As proved by a series of experiments in a real private cloud infrastructure; ourapproach outperforms in query response time and index updating efficiency both Hadoop-based parallel processing of the raw sensor data and multiple alternative indexing …,Big Data; 2013 IEEE International Conference on,2013,10
Tag recommendation for large-scale ontology-based information systems,Roman Prokofyev; Alexey Boyarsky; Oleg Ruchayskiy; Karl Aberer; Gianluca Demartini; Philippe Cudré-Mauroux,Abstract We tackle the problem of improving the relevance of automatically selected tags inlarge-scale ontology-based information systems. Contrary to traditional settings where tagscan be chosen arbitrarily; we focus on the problem of recommending tags (eg; concepts)directly from a collaborative; user-driven ontology. We compare the effectiveness of a seriesof approaches to select the best tags ranging from traditional IR techniques such as TF/IDFweighting to novel techniques based on ontological distances and latent Dirichlet allocation.All our experiments are run against a real corpus of tags and documents extracted from theScienceWise portal; which is connected to ArXiv. org and is currently used by growingnumber of researchers. The datasets for the experiments are made available online forreproducibility purposes.,International Semantic Web Conference,2012,10
Towards the realization of decentralized online social networks: An empirical study,Rammohan Narendula; Thanasis G Papaioannou; Karl Aberer,As the Online Social Networks (OSNs) amass un-precedented amounts of personalinformation; the privacy concerns gain considerable attention from the community. Apartfrom privacy-enabling approaches for existing OSNs; a number of initiatives towardsbuilding decentralized OSN infrastructures have emerged. However; before this paradigmbecomes a serious alternative to current centralized infrastructures; some key designchallenges; often conflicting with each other; have to be addressed. In this paper; we exploresuch design objectives concerning various system properties; namely availability; replicationdegree; user online times; privacy; and experimentally study the trade-offs among thembased on real data sets from Facebook and Twitter.

Semantic activity classification using locomotive signatures from mobile phones,Zhixian Yan; Dipanjan Chakraborty; Archan Misra; Hoyoung Jeung; Karl Aberer,Abstract—We explore the use of mobile phone-generated sensor feeds to determine thehigh-level (ie; at the semantic level); indoor; lifestyle activities of individuals; such as cooking& dining at home and working & having lunch at the workplace. We propose and evaluate a2-T ier activity extraction framework (called SAMMPLE 1) where features of the low-levelaccelerometer data are first used to identify individual locomotive micro-activities (eg; sittingor standing); and the micro-activity sequence is subsequently used to identify thediscriminatory characteristics of individual semantic activities. Using 152 days of real-lifebehavioral traces from users; our approach achieves an average accuracy of 77.14%; animprovement of 16.37% from the traditional 1-T ier approach; which directly uses statisticalfeatures of the accelerometer stream; towards such activity classification tasks.,*,2012,10
Efficiently maintaining distributed model-based views on real-time data streams,Alexandru Arion; Hoyoung Jeung; Karl Aberer,Minimizing communication cost is a fundamental problem in large-scale federated sensornetworks. Maintaining model-based views of data streams has been highlighted because itpermits efficient data communication by transmitting parameter values of models; instead oforiginal data streams. We propose a framework that employs the advantages of using model-based views for communication-efficient stream data processing over federated sensornetworks; yet it significantly improves state-of-the-art approaches. The framework is genericand any time-parameterized models can be plugged; while accuracy guarantees for queryresults are ensured throughout the large-scale networks. In addition; we boost theperformance of the framework by the coded model update that enables efficient modelupdate from one node to another. It predetermines parameter values for the model …,Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM 2011); 2011 IEEE,2011,10
Towards better entity resolution techniques for Web document collections,Surender Reddy Yerva; Zoltán Miklós; Karl Aberer,As person names are non-unique; the same name on different Web pages might or mightnot refer to the same real-world person. This entity identification problem is one of the mostchallenging issues in realizing the Semantic Web or entity-oriented search. We address thisdisambiguation problem; which is very similar to the entity resolution problem studied inrelational databases; however there are also several differences. Most importantly Webpages often only contain partial or incomplete information about the persons; moreover theavailable information is very heterogeneous; thus we are only able to obtain some uncertainevidence about whether two names refer to the same person using similarity functions.These similarity functions capture some aspects of the similarities between Web-pages;where the names occur; thus they perform very differently for the different names.

Synergies of different reputation systems: challenges and opportunities,Le-Hung Vu; Thanasis G Papaioannou; Karl Aberer,Reputation is a well established means to determine trustworthiness in online systems invarious contexts; eg online transactions; product recommendation; e-mail spam fighting; etc.However; typically these reputation systems are``closed''outside of the community: the set ofparticipants; their possible actions; their evaluation and the mechanism to derive trustevaluations are predetermined in the system design. Therefore; existing information ishardly reused and emerging online communities have a" cold" start regardingtrustworthiness. In this paper; we discuss the various opportunities that arise by combiningreputation information from different communities and provide a detail discussion on relatedchallenges; namely identification; mapping of reputation semantics; contextual distance;reputation disclosure (dis) incentives and privacy.

Query-driven indexing for peer-to-peer text retrieval,Gleb Skobeltsyn; Toan Luu; Karl Aberer; Martin Rajman; Ivana Podnar Zarko,Abstract We describe a query-driven indexing framework for scalable text retrieval overstructured P2P networks. To cope with the bandwidth consumption problem that has beenidentified as the major obstacle for full-text retrieval in P2P networks; we truncate postinglists associated with indexing features to a constant size storing only top-k ranked documentreferences. To compensate for the loss of information caused by the truncation; we extendthe set of indexing features with carefully chosen term sets. Indexing term sets are selectedbased on the query statistics extracted from query logs; thus we index only suchcombinations that are a) frequently present in user queries and b) non-redundant wrt the restof the index. The distributed index is compact and efficient as it constantly evolves adaptingto the current query popularity distribution. Moreover; it is possible to control the tradeoff …,Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web,2007,10
From bioinformatic web portals to semantically integrated Data Grid networks,Adriana Budura; Philippe Cudré-Mauroux; Karl Aberer,Abstract We propose a semi-automated method for redeploying bioinformatic databasesindexed in a Web portal as a decentralized; semantically integrated and service-orientedData Grid. We generate peer-to-peer schema mappings leveraging on cross-referencedinstances and instance-based schema matching algorithms. Analyzing real-world dataextracted from an existing portal; we show how a rather trivial combination of lexicographicalmeasures with set distance measures yields surprisingly good results in practice. Finally; wepropose data models for redeploying all instances; schemas and schema mappings in theData Grid; relying on standard Semantic Web technologies.,Future Generation Computer Systems,2007,10
Transactional support for cooperative applications,Jürgen Wäsch; Karl Aberer; Erich J Neuhold,Abstract Cooperative work on shared; persistent data requires computing system support tocoordinate the work of multiple users and to ensure data consistency. Conventionaldatabase transaction models do not meet the requirements of cooperative applications.Isolation of transactions; as guaranteed by the ACID properties; contradicts the need ofcooperation between users. In this paper; we investigate different advanced transactionmodels that target at improved support for cooperative applications. To that extent weanalyze typical cooperative application scenarios and derive from that basic requirementsfor consistent access to shared databases. In particular we discuss in detail the cooperativetransaction model that has been developed within the TRANSCOOP project.

Argument discovery via crowdsourcing,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen; Chi Thang Duong; Thanh Tam Nguyen; Matthias Weidlich; Karl Aberer; Hongzhi Yin; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract The amount of controversial issues being discussed on the Web has been growingdramatically. In articles; blogs; and wikis; people express their points of view in the form ofarguments; ie; claims that are supported by evidence. Discovery of arguments has a largepotential for informing decision-making. However; argument discovery is hindered by thesheer amount of available Web data and its unstructured; free-text representation. Theformer calls for automatic text-mining approaches; whereas the latter implies a need formanual processing to extract the structure of arguments. In this paper; we propose acrowdsourcing-based approach to build a corpus of arguments; an argumentation base;thereby mediating the trade-off of automatic text-mining and manual processing in argumentdiscovery.

PriBots: Conversational Privacy with Chatbots.,Hamza Harkous; Kassem Fawaz; Kang G Shin; Karl Aberer,ABSTRACT Traditional mechanisms for delivering notice and enabling choice have so farfailed to protect users' privacy. Users are continuously frustrated by complex privacy policies;unreachable privacy settings; and a multitude of emerging standards. The miniaturizationtrend of smart devices and the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoTs) will exacerbate thisproblem further. In this paper; we propose Conversational Privacy Bots (PriBots) as a newway of delivering notice and choice through a two-way dialogue between the user and acomputer agent (a chatbot). PriBots improve on state-of-the-art by offering users a moreintuitive and natural interface to inquire about their privacy settings; thus allowing them tocontrol their privacy. In addition to presenting the potential applications of PriBots; wedescribe the underlying system needed to support their functionality. We also delve into …,WSF@ SOUPS,2016,9

Privacy-preserving schema reuse,Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung; Nguyen Thanh Tam; Karl Aberer,Abstract As the number of schema repositories grows rapidly and several webbasedplatforms exist to support publishing schemas; schema reuse becomes a new trend.Schema reuse is a methodology that allows users to create new schemas by copying andadapting existing ones. This methodology supports to reduce not only the effort of designingnew schemas but also the heterogeneity between them. One of the biggest barriers ofschema reuse is about privacy concerns that discourage schema owners from contributingtheir schemas. Addressing this problem; we develop a framework that enables privacy-preserving schema reuse. Our framework supports the contributors to define their ownprotection policies in the form of privacy constraints. Instead of showing original schemas;the framework returns an anonymized schema with maximal utility while satisfying these …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2014,9
Entity disambiguation in tweets leveraging user social profiles,Surender Reddy Yerva; Michele Catasta; Gianluca Demartini; Karl Aberer,Pervasive web and social networks are becoming part of everyone's life. Users through theiractivities on these networks are leaving traces of their expertise; interests and personalities.With the advances in Web mining and user modeling techniques it is possible to leveragethe user social network activity history to extract the semantics of user-generated content. Inthis work we explore various techniques for constructing user profiles based on the contentthey publish on social networks. We further show that one of the advantages of maintainingsocial network user profiles is to provide the context for better understanding of microposts.We propose and experimentally evaluate different approaches for entity disambiguation insocial networks based on syntactic and semantic features on top of two different socialnetworks: a general-interest network (ie; Twitter) and a domain-specific network (ie …,Information Reuse and Integration (IRI); 2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on,2013,9

Guest editor's introduction,Karl Aberer,P2P computing has become an extremely popular topic in computer science. It affectsdiverse areas such as networking; distributed systems; information systems; algorithms anddatabases. The P2P paradigm introduces an architectural principle “replacing” the paradigmof client-server computing. It is based on the concepts of decentralization and resourcesharing. By avoiding central bottlenecks and distributing workload it facilitates thedeployment of applications at a global scale. The use of the P2P paradigm as a practicalapproach for developing scalable applications has not emerged from academic research;but resulted from a number of grass-root efforts on the Web. The most popoular ones weresystems for the purpose of (music) file sharing; such as Napster; Gnutella and Kaaza.

Semantic web graph implied by user preferred activities,Jie Wu; Karl Aberer,The web can be viewed as a directed graph if we take entities in the web as the vertices andconnections which imply some relationship between pairs of the entities as the directededges. Several such graphs can be set up to model the World Wide Web and berepresented; saved and processed in proper mathematical way; eg; the application of thetheory of matrix computation. When we use the web documents as the entities and the weblinks from one page to another as the directed edges; the graph becomes the normal onethat is widely used in algorithms like PageRank [1] and its descendants. In this family ofalgorithms; hyper web links are intuitively considered to embed the information of pageimportance from the viewpoint of page authors.

Estimating human interactions with electrical appliances for activity-based energy savings recommendations,Hông-Ân Cao; Tri Kurniawan Wijaya; Karl Aberer; Nuno Nunes,Since the power consumption of different electrical appliances in a household can berecorded by individual smart meters; it becomes possible to start considering in more detailthe interactions of the residents with those devices throughout the day.

In this work; we analyze three different permission models that aim todiscourage users from installing over-privileged apps. In experiments with 210 real users;we discover that the most successful permission model is our novel ensemble method thatwe call Far-reaching Insights.

Fast distributed correlation discovery over streaming time-series data,Tian Guo; Saket Sathe; Karl Aberer,Abstract The dramatic rise of time-series data in a variety of contexts; such as socialnetworks; mobile sensing; data centre monitoring; etc.; has fuelled interest in obtaining real-time insights from such data using distributed stream processing systems. One suchextremely valuable insight is the discovery of correlations in real-time from large-scale time-series data. A key challenge in discovering correlations is that the number of time-seriespairs that have to be analyzed grows quadratically in the number of time-series; giving riseto a quadratic increase in both computation cost and communication cost between thecluster nodes in a distributed environment. To tackle the challenge; we propose a frameworkcalled AEGIS. AEGIS exploits well-established statistical properties to dramatically prune thenumber of time-series pairs that have to be evaluated for detecting interesting correlations …,Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2015,8
An energy-aware method for the joint recognition of activities and gestures using wearable sensors,Joseph Korpela; Kazuyuki Takase; Takahiro Hirashima; Takuya Maekawa; Julien Eberle; Dipanjan Chakraborty; Karl Aberer,Abstract This paper presents an energy-aware method for recognizing time seriesacceleration data containing both activities and gestures using a wearable device coupledwith a smartphone. In our method; we use a small wearable device to collect accelerometerdata from a user's wrist; recognizing each data segment using a minimal feature set chosenautomatically for that segment. For each collected data segment; if our model finds thatrecognizing the segment requires high-cost features that the wearable device cannot extract;such as dynamic time warping for gesture recognition; then the segment is transmitted to thesmartphone where the high-cost features are extracted and recognition is performed.Otherwise; only the minimum required set of low-cost features are extracted from thesegment on the wearable device and only the recognition result; ie; label; is transmitted to …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computers,2015,8
SMART: A tool for analyzing and reconciling schema matching networks,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen; Thanh Tam Nguyen; Vinh Tuan Chau; Tri Kurniawan Wijaya; Zoltán Miklós; Karl Aberer; Avigdor Gal; Matthias Weidlich,Schema matching supports data integration by establishing correspondences between theattributes of independently designed database schemas. In recent years; various tools forautomatic pair-wise matching of schemas have been developed. Since the matchingprocess is inherently uncertain; the correspondences generated by such tools are oftenvalidated by a human expert. In this work; we consider scenarios in which attributecorrespondences are identified in a network of schemas and not only in a pairwise setting.Here; correspondences between different schemas are interrelated; so that incomplete anderroneous matching results propagate in the network and the validation of acorrespondence by an expert has ripple effects.

Semantic and Sensitivity Aware Location Privacy Protection for the Internet of Things.,Berker Agir; Jean-Paul Calbimonte; Karl Aberer,Abstract. Everyday applications and ubiquitous devices contribute data to the Internet ofThings; oftentimes including sensitive information of people. This opens new challenges forprotecting users' data from adversaries; who can perform different types of attacks usingcombinations of private and publicly available information. In this paper; we discuss some ofthe main challenges; especially regarding location-privacy; and a general approach foradaptively protecting this type of data. This approach considers the semantics of the userlocation; as well as the user's sensitivity preferences; and also builds an adversary model forestimating privacy levels.,PrivOn@ ISWC,2014,8
Impact of instance seeking strategies on resource allocation in cloud data centers,Hao Zhuang; Xin Liu; Zhonghong Ou; Karl Aberer,With the prosperity of cloud computing; an increasing number of Small and Medium-sizedEnterprises (SMEs) move their business to public clouds such as Amazon EC2. To helptenants deploy services in the cloud; researchers either conduct performance evaluations ordesign mechanisms and software on seeking virtual machines of better performance.However; few studies have investigated the impact of instance seeking strategies onresource allocation in clouds if every tenant starts to apply the same method to find the betterperforming virtual machine. In this paper; we propose a cloud and a tenant model in order tosimulate the process of tenants' seeking better-performing instances in the cloud. Wediscuss; implement and evaluate six cloud resource allocation strategies and five instanceseeking strategies. We perform the evaluation via simulation based on real data traces …,Cloud Computing (CLOUD); 2013 IEEE Sixth International Conference on,2013,8
AFFINITY: Efficiently querying statistical measures on time-series data,Saket Sathe; Karl Aberer,Computing statistical measures for large databases of time series is a fundamental primitivefor querying and mining time-series data [1]-[6]. This primitive is gaining importance with theincreasing number and rapid growth of time series databases. In this paper; we introduce aframework for efficient computation of statistical measures by exploiting the concept of affinerelationships. Affine relationships can be used to infer statistical measures for time series;from other related time series; instead of computing them directly; thus; reducing the overallcomputational cost significantly. The resulting methods exhibit at least one order ofmagnitude improvement over the best known methods. To the best of our knowledge; this isthe first work that presents an unified approach for computing and querying severalstatistical measures at once. Our approach exploits affine relationships using three key …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,8
Fuzzynet: Zero-maintenance ringless overlay,Sarunas Girdzijauskas; Wojciech Galuba; Vasilios Darlagiannis; Anwitaman Datta; Karl Aberer,Abstract Many structured overlay networks rely on a ring invariant as a core networkconnectivity element. The responsibility ranges of the participating peers and navigabilityprinciples (greedy routing) heavily depend on the ring structure. For correctness guarantees;each node needs to eagerly maintain its immediate neighboring links-the ring invariant.However; the ring maintenance is an expensive task and it may not even be possible tomaintain the ring invariant continuously under high churn; particularly as the network sizegrows. Furthermore; routing anomalies in the network; peers behind firewalls and NetworkAddress Translators (NATs) create non-transitivity effects; which inevitably lead to theviolation of the ring invariant. We argue that reliance on the ring structure is a seriousimpediment for real life deployment and scalability of structured overlays. In this paper we …,*,2008,8
Generic emergent overlays in arbitrary peer identifier spaces,Wojciech Galuba; Karl Aberer,Abstract Unstructured overlay networks are driven by simple protocols that are easy toanalyze and implement. The lack of structure; however; leads to weak message deliveryguarantees and poor scaling. Structured overlays impose a global overlay topology that isthen maintained by all peers in a complex protocol. In contrast to unstructured approachesthe structured overlays are efficient and scalable; but leave little flexibility in how theirtopology can be adapted to the needs of the application. We propose a generic overlaymaintenance and routing algorithm that combines the simplicity of the unstructured overlaysand the scalability of the structured approaches; while allowing the application to define itsown peer identifier space. The overlay topology is not explicitly defined but emerges in a self-organized way as the result of simple maintenance rules. Independently of the identifier …,International Workshop on Self-Organizing Systems,2007,8
Authentication-free fault-tolerant peer-to-peer service provisioning,Wojciech Galuba; Karl Aberer; Zoran Despotovic; Wolfgang Kellerer,Abstract. The correct functioning of a peer-to-peer network relies on cooperative behavior ofpeers as service providers. Current approaches to detection and deterrence of non-cooperative behavior; such as reputation systems; rely on (1) global sharing of observationsabout service provisioning and (2) global authentication. These two factors severely impairthe practical applicability. We propose a novel forward feedback protocol that is completelylocal and authentication-free and where peers locally and independently learn to avoid non-cooperative peers and routing failures. We evaluate our system in a variety of failurescenarios. The convergence rates and failure resilience are close to those of a fullycentralized reputation system. High churn is tolerated without significant drop inperformance. For increased fault tolerance the system takes advantage of the service …,Databases; Information Systems and Peer-to-Peer Computing,2007,8
Towards a common framework for peer-to-peer web retrieval,Karl Aberer; Jie Wu,Abstract Search engines are among the most important services on the Web. Due to thescale of the ever-growing Web; classic centralized models and algorithms can no longermeet the requirements of a search system for the whole Web. Decentralization seems to bean attractive alternative. Consequently Web retrieval has received growing attention in thearea of peer-to-peer systems. Decentralization of Web retrieval methods; in particular of text-based retrieval and link-based ranking as used in standard Web search engines havebecome subject of intensive research. This allows both to distribute the computational effortfor more scalable solutions and to share different interpretations of the Web content tosupport personalized and context-dependent search. In this paper we first review existingstudies about the algorithmic feasibility of realizing peer-to-peer Web search using text …,*,2005,8

Supporting dynamic information visualization with VRML and databases,Thomas Risse; Martin Leissler; Matthias Hemmje; Karl Aberer; Thomas Klement,ABSTRACT Nowadays; many state-of-the-art user interfaces to complexly structured datacollections require appropriate information visualization methods. With the increase ingraphics performance available on client systems; methods for three-dimensionalvisualization can be applied more easily. The conceptual approach presented in this paperdynamically generates threedimensional VRML scenes from information stored in databasesystems. To achieve this; VRML is extended with new nodes for supporting the server sidegeneration of VRML scenes and for supporting trigger mechanisms. An implementation ofthe introduced concept is introduced by means of an object relational database systemwhich is extended with a new VRML data type and its related functions. Altogether; theseconcepts and software components provide a platform for server-based information …,Proceedings of the 1998 workshop on New paradigms in information visualization and manipulation,1998,8
Normal forms in function fields,Karl Aberer,Abstract We consider function fields of functions of one variable augmented by the binaryoperation of composition of functions. It is shown that the straightforward axiomatization ofthis concept allows the introduction of a normal form for expressions denoting elements insuch fields. While the description of this normal form seems relatively intuitive; it issurprisingly difficult to prove this fact. We present an algorithm for the normalization ofexpressions; formulated in the symbolic computer algebra language mathematica. Thisallows us to effectively decide compositional identities in such fields. Examples are given.,Proceedings of the international symposium on Symbolic and algebraic computation,1990,8
Robust online time series prediction with recurrent neural networks,Tian Guo; Zhao Xu; Xin Yao; Haifeng Chen; Karl Aberer; Koichi Funaya,Time series forecasting for streaming data plays an important role in many real applications;ranging from IoT systems; cyber-networks; to industrial systems and healthcare. Howeverthe real data is often complicated with anomalies and change points; which can lead thelearned models deviating from the underlying patterns of the time series; especially in thecontext of online learning mode. In this paper we present an adaptive gradient learningmethod for recurrent neural networks (RNN) to forecast streaming time series in thepresence of anomalies and change points. We explore the local features of time series toautomatically weight the gradients of the loss of the newly available observations withdistributional properties of the data in real time. We perform extensive experimental analysison both synthetic and real datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.,Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA); 2016 IEEE International Conference on,2016,7
Online unsupervised state recognition in sensor data,Julien Eberle; Tri Kurniawan Wijaya; Karl Aberer,Smart sensors; such as smart meters or smart phones; are nowadays ubiquitous. To be“smart”; however; they need to process their input data with limited storage andcomputational resources. In this paper; we convert the stream of sensor data into a stream ofsymbols; and further; to higher level symbols in such a way that common analytical taskssuch as anomaly detection; forecasting or state recognition; can still be carried out on thetransformed data with almost no loss of accuracy; and using far fewer resources. We identifystates of a monitored system and convert them into symbols (thus; reducing data size); whilekeeping “interesting” events; such as anomalies or transition between states; as it is. Ouralgorithm is able to find states of various length in an online and unsupervised way; which iscrucial since behavior of the system is not known beforehand.

Decentralizing the cloud: How can small data centers cooperate?,Hao Zhuang; Rameez Rahman; Karl Aberer,Cloud computing has become pervasive due to attractive features such as on-demandresource provisioning and elasticity. Most cloud providers are centralized entities thatemploy massive data centers. However; in recent times; due to increasing concerns aboutprivacy and data control; many small data centers (SDCs) established by different providersare emerging in an attempt to meet demand locally. However; SDCs can suffer fromresource in-elasticity due to their relatively scarce resources; resulting in a loss ofperformance and revenue. In this paper we propose a decentralized cloud model in which agroup of SDCs can cooperate with each other to improve performance. Moreover; we designa general strategy function for the SDCs to evaluate the performance of cooperation basedon different dimensions of resource sharing.

In contrast to prior work; where complex activity recognition isperformed offline with the observation of the activity available for its entire duration andutilizing deeply-instrumented environments; we focus on online activity detection using onlyaccelerometer data from a single body-worn smartphone device. We present window basedalgorithms for online detection that effectively perform different tradeoffs betweenclassification accuracy and detection latency.

Distributed processing of continuous sliding-window k-NN queries for data stream filtering,Krešimir Pripužić; Ivana Podnar Žarko; Karl Aberer,Abstract A sliding-window k-NN query (k-NN/w query) continuously monitors incoming datastream objects within a sliding window to identify k closest objects to a query. It enableseffective filtering of data objects streaming in at high rates from potentially distributedsources; and offers means to control the rate of object insertions into result streams.Therefore k-NN/w processing systems may be regarded as one of the prospective solutionsfor the information overload problem in applications that require processing of structureddata in real-time; such as the Sensor Web. Existing k-NN/w processing systems are mainlycentralized and cannot cope with multiple data streams; where data sources are scatteredover the Internet. In this paper; we propose a solution for distributed continuous k-NN/wprocessing of structured data from distributed streams. We define a k-NN/w processing …,World Wide Web,2011,7
Impact of trust management and information sharing to adversarial cost in ranking systems,Le-Hung Vu; Thanasis G Papaioannou; Karl Aberer,Abstract Ranking systems such as those in product review sites and recommender systemsusually use ratings to rank favorite items based on both their quality and popularity. Sincehigher ranked items are more likely selected and yield more revenues for their owners;providers of unpopular and low quality items have strong incentives to strategicallymanipulate their ranking. This paper analyzes the adversary cost for manipulating theserankings in a variety of scenarios. Particularly; we analyze and compare the adversarial costto attack ranking systems that use various trust measures to detect and eliminate maliciousratings to systems that use no such a trust management mechanism. We provide theoreticalresults showing the relation between the capability of the trust mechanism in detectingmalicious ratings and the minimal adversarial cost for successfully changing the ranking …,IFIP International Conference on Trust Management,2010,7
Self-organized fault-tolerant routing in peer-to-peer overlays,Wojciech Galuba; Karl Aberer; Zoran Despotovic; Wolfgang Kellerer,In sufficiently large heterogeneous overlays message loss and delays are likely to occur.This has a significant impact on overlay routing; especially on longer paths. The existingsolutions to this problem rely on message redundancy to mask the loss and delays. Thisincurs a significant bandwidth cost. We propose the Forward Feedback Protocol (FFP) whichonly routes a single copy of the message and detects the message loss and excessivedelays while routing. Failures are signaled along the routing paths. Based only on thesimple binary signals; each overlay node locally and independently learns to route to avoidfailures. The local node interactions lead to the emergence of fast reliable overlay routes.This is a continuous process; the system constantly self-organizes in response to changingdelay and loss conditions.

Building a peer-to-peer full-text Web search engine with highly discriminative keys,Karl Aberer; Fabius Klemm; Toan Luu; Ivana Podnar; Martin Rajman,Abstract Web search engines designed on top of peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay networks showpromise to enable attractive search scenarios operating at a large scale. However thedesign of effective indexing techniques for extremely large document collections still raises anumber of open technical challenges. Resource sharing; self-organization; and lowmaintenance costs are favorable properties of P2P overlays in the perspective of large-scalesearch; but we also face new problems due to potentially huge bandwidth consumptionduring both indexing and querying; as well as the unavailability of global documentcollection statistics. Since a straightforward application of P2P solutions for Web searchgenerates unscalable indexing and search traffic; we propose a novel indexing techniquewhich maintains a global key index in structured P2P overlays.

Using a layered markov model for decentralized web ranking,Jie Wu; Karl Aberer,Abstract The link structure of the Web graph is used in algorithms such as Kleinberg's HITSand Google's PageRank to assign authoritative weights to Web pages and thus rank them.In HITS; a solid theoretical model is lacking and the algorithm often leads to non-unique ornon-intuitive rankings where zero weights may inappropriately be assigned to parts of anetwork. In PageRank; a model of random walks is proposed such that the theory about thestationary state of a Markov process can be applied to assure convergence to a uniqueranking. Both algorithms require a centralized computation of the ranking if used to rank thecomplete Web graph. In this paper; we propose a new approach based on a LayeredMarkov Model to distinguish transitions among Web sites and Web documents. Based onthis model; we propose two different approaches for computation of ranking of Web …,*,2004,7

Rule-based generation of logical query plans with controlled complexity,Karl Aberer; Dunren Che; Klemens Böhm,Abstract Rule-based query optimizers are recognized as particularly valuable for extensibleand object-oriented database management systems by providing a high flexibility inadapting query optimization strategies to nonstandard application needs. On the other handrule-based optimizers are problematic with regard to run-time behavior for more complexqueries as the generation of query plans based on a declarative rule base tends to bedifficult to control. In this paper we show that this is not a fundamental problem of rule-basedoptimizers; but rather a question of careful design of the rule system. We exemplify this forone fundamental optimization problem; namely join enumeration for linear queries. There; arule-based optimization strategy can achieve the theoretically optimal complexity.

Towards enabling probabilistic databases for participatory sensing,Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung; Saket Sathe; Duong Chi Thang; Karl Aberer,Participatory sensing has emerged as a new data collection paradigm; in which humans usetheir own devices (cell phone accelerometers; cameras; etc.) as sensors. This paradigmenables to collect a huge amount of data from the crowd for world-wide applications; withoutspending cost to buy dedicated sensors. Despite of this benefit; the data collected fromhuman sensors are inherently uncertain due to no quality guarantee from the participants.Moreover; the participatory sensing data are time series that not only exhibit highly irregulardependencies on time; but also vary from sensor to sensor. To overcome these issues; westudy in this paper the problem of creating probabilistic data from given (uncertain) timeseries collected by participatory sensors. We approach the problem in two steps.

System and Method for Optimizing Data Storage in a Distributed Data Storage Environment,*,A growing amount of data is produced daily resulting in a growing demand for storagesolutions. While cloud storage providers offer a virtually infinite storage capacity; dataowners seek geographical and provider diversity in data placement; in order to avoid vendorlock-in and to increase availability and durability. Moreover; depending on the customerdata access pattern; a certain cloud provider may be cheaper than another. In this respect isprovided a method and a system that facilitates allocation of data objects in a distributeddata storage environment.

Query-driven indexing in large-scale distributed systems,Gleb Skobeltsyn,Abstract Efficient and effective search in large-scale data repositories requires complexindexing solutions deployed on a large number of servers. Web search engines such asGoogle and Yahoo! already rely upon complex systems to be able to return relevant queryresults and keep processing times within the comfortable sub-second limit. Nevertheless; theexponential growth of the amount of content on the Web poses serious challenges withrespect to scalability. Coping with these challenges requires novel indexing solutions thatnot only remain scalable but also preserve the search accuracy. In this thesis we introduceand explore the concept of query-driven indexing–an index construction strategy that usescaching techniques to adapt to the querying patterns expressed by users. We suggest toabandon the strict difference between indexing and caching; and to build a distributed …,*,2009,6

Thus theInternet information space and the physical environment become increasingly entangled inwhat we call a smart Earth. We illustrate technical challenges and applications from the workof the Swiss national competence centre of research in mobile information andcommunication systems (NCCR-MICS). We identify the three layers of data access networks;semantic overlay networks and social networks as essential building blocks and observethat each of these network layers will be largely self-organized.

Improving the throughput of distributed hash tables using congestion-aware routing,Fabius Klemm; Jean-Yves Le Boudec; Dejan Kostic; Karl Aberer,Abstract Advanced applications for Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs); such as Peer-to-PeerInformation Retrieval; require a DHT to quickly and efficiently process a large number (in theorder of millions) of requests. In this paper we study mechanisms to optimize the throughputof DHTs. Our goal is to maximize the number of route operations per peer per second a DHTcan perform (given certain constraints on the lookup delay). Each peer receives congestionfeedback from the DHT; which it uses to adjust its routing decisions. This way; peers canavoid routing through slow parts of the overlay network and hence increase the rate at whichthey insert new messages into the DHT. We provide a numerical analysis of congestion-aware routing in DHTs and show that considerable improvements in throughput are possiblecompared to DHTs with proximity neighbor selection and strictly greedy routing.,IPTPS,2007,6
Efficient peer-to-peer belief propagation,Roman Schmidt; Karl Aberer,Abstract In this paper; we will present an efficient approach for distributed inference.

Thereafter correlated data is stored close to each otherreducing the message cost for inference. We simulated our approach in Matlab and showthe message reduction and the achieved load balance for random; tree-shaped; and scale-free Bayesian networks of different sizes. As possible application; we envision a distributedsoftware knowledge base maintaining encountered software bugs under users' systemconfigurations together with possible solutions for other users having similar problems.Users would not only be able to repair their system but also to foresee possible problems …,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2006,6

Configuration of distributed message converter systems,Thomas Risse; Karl Aberer; Andreas Wombacher; Mike Surridge; Stephen Taylor,Abstract Finding a configuration of a distributed system satisfying performance goals is acomplex search problem that involves many design parameters; like hardware selection; jobdistribution and process configuration. Performance models are a powerful tool to analyzepotential system configurations; however; their evaluation is expensive; such that only alimited number of possible configurations can be evaluated. In this paper we present asystematic method to find a satisfactory configuration with feasible effort; based on a two-step approach. First; performing a queuing network analysis a hardware configuration isdetermined and then a software configuration is incrementally optimized by simulatingLayered Queuing Network models. We applied this method to the design of performant EDIconverter systems in the financial domain; where increasing message volumes need to …,Performance Evaluation,2004,6

webXice: an Infrastructure for Information Commerce on the WWW,Andreas Wombacher; Paraskevi Kostaki; Karl Aberer,Systems for information commerce on the WWW have to support flexible business models ifthey are to cover the wide range of requirements that are imposed by the different types ofinformation businesses. This leads to non-trivial functional and security requirements bothon the provider side and on the consumer side; for which we introduce an architecture and asystem implementation called webXice (Web-enabled eXtended Information and ContentExchange protocol). We focus on the question of how participants with minimaltechnological requisites; ie with just standard Web browsers available; can betechnologically enabled to participate in the information commerce at a system level; whilenot sacrificing the functionality and security required by an autonomous participant in aninformation commerce scenario.

Online scheduling in distributed message converter systems,Thomas Risse; Andreas Wombacher; Mike Surridge; Steve Taylor; Karl Aberer,Abstract The optimal distribution of jobs among hosts in distributed environments is animportant factor to achieve high performance. The optimal strategy depends on theapplication. In this paper we present a new online scheduling strategy for distributed EDIconverter system. The strategy is based on the Bin-Stretching approach. The originalalgorithm has been enhanced to satisfy the business goals of meeting deadlines; priorityprocessing; low response time and high throughput. The algorithm can be flexible adaptedto different objective goals due to its two-stage strategy. We show by simulation andmeasurements on a real system that the modified Bin-Stretching approach fulfills theobjective goals while requiring only low computational effort.,Parallel and Distributed Computing Systems (PDCS 2001),2001,6
Efficient processing of voluminous edi documents,Thomas Risse; Andreas Wombacher; Karl Aberer,ABSTRACT Business data is frequently exchanged between heterogeneous informationsystems using standard EDI formats like EDIFACT; X12 and in the future also XML/EDI. Forinhouse use; data represented in these formats must be converted to inhouse data formatsby message converters. With the growing usage of EDI; high volumes of data; like financialtransactions; must be converted and processed efficiently and reliably. Considering thecomplex hierarchical structure of EDI messages; message conversion is a complex datatransformation problem. For efficient processing; the different conversion steps have to beexecuted in an optimized manner exploiting the available; typically distributed; processingarchitecture. In addition; the processing has to take into account different optimization goals;like maximizing throughput; minimizing delays and keeping deadlines.,8th European Conference on Information Systems (ECIS 2000),2000,6
Scheduling non-enforceable contracts among autonomous agents,Thomas Tesch; Karl Aberer,With the emergence of fast and standardized communication infrastructures over whichseparately designed agents of different organizations can interact in real-time; there is anincreasing demand for cooperation mechanisms that allow to carry out inter-organizationalcooperations in a safe way. The lack of external control over an agent's decisions; resourcesand actions hamper the usage of traditional transaction and workflow technology to makeself-interested agents cooperate; ie; agents cannot not be forced from a mediatingcooperation instance to continue a cooperation. The challenge is; therefore; to design acooperation mechanism that motivates cooperating agents to carry out a specified contractand; in case of unilateral defection; ensures that none of the cooperators can benefit fromthe situation.

Towards a highly effective and robust Web credibility evaluation system,Xin Liu; Radoslaw Nielek; Paulina Adamska; Adam Wierzbicki; Karl Aberer,Abstract By leveraging crowdsourcing; Web credibility evaluation systems (WCESs) havebecome a promising tool to assess the credibility of Web content; eg; Web pages. However;existing systems adopt a passive way to collect users' credibility ratings; which incurs twocrucial challenges:(1) a considerable fraction of Web content have few or even no ratings; sothe coverage (or effectiveness) of the system is low;(2) malicious users may submit fakeratings to damage the reliability of the system. In order to realize a highly effective and robustWCES; we propose to integrate recommendation functionality into the system. On the onehand; by fusing Matrix Factorization and Latent Dirichlet Allocation; a personalized Webcontent recommendation model is proposed to attract users to rate more Web pages; ie; thecoverage is increased. On the other hand; by analyzing a user's reaction to the …,Decision Support Systems,2015,5

To this end; learning whenappliances are in an active or idle state and the related user activity is crucial. Until smartappliances become widespread and can communicate their internal state; identifying whenthe residents interact with the appliances has to be determined from the availableinformation that can be recorded from these devices.

Tag-based paper retrieval: minimizing user effort with diversity awareness,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen; Son Thanh Do; Thanh Tam Nguyen; Karl Aberer,Abstract As the number of scientific papers getting published is likely to soar; most of modernpaper management systems (eg ScienceWise; Mendeley; CiteULike) support tag-basedretrieval. In that; each paper is associated with a set of tags; allowing user to search forrelevant papers by formulating tag-based queries against the system. One of the most criticalissues in tag-based retrieval is that user often has difficulties in precisely formulating hisinformation need. Addressing this issue; our paper tackles the problem of automaticallysuggesting new tags for user when he formulates a query. The set of tags are selected insuch a way that resolves query ambiguity in two aspects: informativeness and diversity.While the former reduces user effort in finding the desired papers; the latter enhances thevariety of information shown to user.

Semantic Data Layers in Air Quality Monitoring for Smarter Cities,Jean-Paul Calbimonte; Julien Eberle; Karl Aberer,Abstract. Air pollution is one of the key indicators for quality of life in urban environments;and is also the subject of global health concern; given the number of mortal diseasesassociated to exposure to pollutants. Assessing and monitoring air quality is an importantstep in order to better understand the impact of pollution on the health of the population.Nevertheless; in order to scale to the city level; traditional high-quality stationary sensingstations are not enough. Limitations include lack of coverage; the cost of deployment andmaintenance; as well as the resolution of the observed phenomena. The OpenSense2project aims at providing a city-level sensing deployment that combines different levels of airquality sensing: reference stations; mobile sensing on public transportation; andparticipatory crowdsensing. In this paper we highlight some of the key challenges of …,Proc. of the 6th Workshop on Semantics for Smarter Cities S4SC 2015; at ISWC 2015,2015,5
Comparing the predictive capability of social and interest affinity for recommendations,Alexandra Olteanu; Anne-Marie Kermarrec; Karl Aberer,Abstract The advent of online social networks created new prediction opportunities forrecommender systems: instead of relying on past rating history through the use ofcollaborative filtering (CF); they can leverage the social relations among users as a predictorof user tastes similarity. Alas; little effort has been put into understanding when and why (eg;for which users and what items) the social affinity (ie; how well connected users are in thesocial network) is a better predictor of user preferences than the interest affinity among themas algorithmically determined by CF; and how to better evaluate recommendationsdepending on; for instance; what type of users a recommendation application targets. Thisoverlook is explained in part by the lack of a systematic collection of datasets including boththe explicit social network among users and the collaborative annotated items.

Online indexing and distributed querying model-view sensor data in the cloud,Tian Guo; Thanasis G Papaioannou; Hao Zhuang; Karl Aberer,Abstract As various kinds of sensors penetrate our daily life (eg; sensor networks forenvironmental monitoring); the efficient management of massive amount of sensor databecomes increasingly important at present. Traditional sensor data management systemsbased on relational database lack scalability to accommodate large-scale sensor dataefficiently. Consequently; distributed key-value stores in the cloud is becoming the prime toolto manage sensor data. Meanwhile; model-view sensor data management stores the sensordata in the form of modelled segments. However; currently there is no index and queryoptimizations upon the modelled segments in the cloud; which results in full table scan in theworst case. In this paper; we propose an innovative model index for sensor data segments inkey-value stores (KVM-index).

Modelling the ICE standard with a formal language for information commerce,Andreas Wombacher; Karl Aberer,Abstract Automatizing information commerce requires languages to represent the typicalinformation commerce processes. Existing languages and standards cover either only veryspecific types of business models or are too general to capture in a concise way the specificproperties of information commerce processes. We introduce a language that is specificallydesigned for information commerce. It can be directly used for the implementation of theprocesses and communication required in information commerce. We demonstrate the useof the language by applying it to an important standard for specifying information commerceprocesses; the ICE Information and Content Exchange protocol [ICE1]. By doing so we alsoillustrate the benefit of using formal specifications for information commerce processesallowing to capture informal specifications; like ICE; in a concise way.,International Conference on Electronic Commerce and Web Technologies,2001,5
The design of query interfaces to the GPCRDB biological database,Dunren Che; Karl Aberer; Yangjun Chen,We describe the query interfaces of a practical biological database system-GPCRDB.Distinguishing features of the system include: an embedded smart query engine (for queryrelaxation); smooth integration of navigation with the more conventional SQL-based querymechanisms; and the top-down style of incremental query result presentation combined withflexible navigation capabilities. Query relaxation is important due to the fact that queries tendnot to be expressed exactly by the users; particularly when complex domain knowledge isinvolved. Navigation capability is desired because it can be an ideal supplement to SQL-based query mechanisms when large; complex data sets are concerned; especially in theWWW environment where hyperlinks are heavily used.

Unterstützung des strukturierten Zugriffs auf MPEG Videos in einem Multimedia Datenbankmanagementsystem,Matthias Malsy; Silvia Hollfelder; Arnd Steinmetz; Karl Aberer,Zusammenfassung Videoanwendungen; die auf einzelne Segmente eines kodiertenMediums zugreifen; benötigen Informationen über die Struktur der Daten. Um dieseStrukturinformation zu erhalten; müssen kodierte Videodaten geparst werden. DieseInformationen werden üblicherweise nicht persistent gehalten; was bei einem wiederholtenZugriff ineffizient ist. Dieser Artikel beschreibt die Integration eines MPEG-Parsers in einerweiterbares Datenbankmanagementsystem. Dadurch werden Funktionen für den Zugriffauf inhaltsbezogene Daten wie auch grundlegende Funktionen zum Extrahieren vonDatenströmen oder Dekodieren einzelner Bilder als Datenbankfunktionalität zur Verfügunggestellt.

Building a configurable database application for structured documents,Klemens Böhm; K Aberer; W Klas,Abstract Storing structured documents in object-oriented databases and fragmenting themaccording to their logical structure gives way to more expressive querying mechanisms; ascompared to conventional document-management systems. At a rst stage; however; such anapproach does not come out too good with regard to the performance of certain other basicoperations. Thus; our database-application framework for document storage has beenextended so that document-type-speci c semantics can be re ected with documents'database-internal representation. In this article; the dimensions of con gurability aredescribed. Further; we say how the parameters are speci ed and how the non-trivialproblems with regard to the realization have been solved. We discuss which (not-yet-existing) database features might have been advantageous in this context.,*,1995,5

Combinatory models and symbolic computation,Karl Aberer,Abstract We introduce an algebraic model of computation which is especially useful for thedescription of computations in analysis. On one level the model allows the representation ofalgebraic computation and on an other level approximate computation is represented.Furthermore programs are themselves algebraic expressions. Therefore it is possible toalgebraically manipulate programs of symbolic and numerical computation; thus providingsymbolic computation with a firm semantic foundation and giving a natural model for mixedsymbolic-numerical computation. We illustrate these facts with examples.,International Symposium on Design and Implementation of Symbolic Computation Systems,1992,5
Data summarization with social contexts,Hao Zhuang; Rameez Rahman; Xia Hu; Tian Guo; Pan Hui; Karl Aberer,Abstract While social data is being widely used in various applications such as sentimentanalysis and trend prediction; its sheer size also presents great challenges for storing;sharing and processing such data. These challenges can be addressed by datasummarization which transforms the original dataset into a smaller; yet still useful; subset.Existing methods find such subsets with objective functions based on data properties suchas representativeness or informativeness but do not exploit social contexts; which aredistinct characteristics of social data. Further; till date very little work has focused on topicpreserving data summarization; despite the abundant work on topic modeling. This is achallenging task for two reasons. First; since topic model is based on latent variables;existing methods are not well-suited to capture latent topics. Second; it is difficult to find …,Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2016,4
An evaluation of diversification techniques,Duong Chi Thang; Nguyen Thanh Tam; Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung; Karl Aberer,Abstract Diversification is a method of improving user satisfaction by increasing the variety ofinformation shown to user. Due to the lack of a precise definition of information variety; manydiversification techniques have been proposed.

Addressing this problem; this paper presents abenchmark that offers a comprehensive empirical study on the performance comparison ofdiversification. Specifically; we integrate several state-of-the-art diversification algorithms ina comparable manner; and measure distinct characteristics of these algorithms with varioussettings.

Neither Web search nor structured queries can effectively answer thistype of queries; even when supported by Human Computation solutions. In this paper; wepropose a new approach to answer memory queries that we call Transactive Search: Theuser-requested memory is reconstructed from a group of people by exchanging pieces ofpersonal memories in order to reassemble the overall memory; which is stored in adistributed fashion among members of the group.

We propose to combine virtual and physical sensors from mobile devices to inferdigital memories of user activities in a semi-supervised fashion. In MemorySense; sensordata is processed by a space and energy efficient algorithm to recognize basic activities. Wethen use semantic reasoning to aggregate these activities into the digital equivalent of ahuman episodic memory.,Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PERCOM Workshops); 2014 IEEE International Conference on,2014,4
Crowdsourcing behavioral incentives for pervasive demand response,Tri Kurniawan Wijaya; Matteo Vasirani; Karl Aberer,Demand response (DR) refers to a set of dynamic demand mechanisms that aim to manageelectricity consumption in response to supply-side signals. DR can be used for the purposeof demand regulation (eg to maintain voltage and frequency within safety limits) as well asfor energy balance (eg to shift demand to off-peak periods; to curtail demand duringemergency situations; or to offset fluctuations caused by less predictable energy sourcessuch as wind or solar). DR is often carried out through direct load control (DLC); in whichcase it is called direct DR or dispatchable DR. Nevertheless; consumer behavior can also beinfluenced by using indirect methods of DR such as incentives; real-time information; ordynamic pricing. This second type of DR is called indirect DR or reactive DR. Direct DR hasthe advantage that the expected outcome of a DR signal is measurable and quantifiable …,*,2014,4
Topick: Accurate topic distillation for user streams,Anton Dimitrov; Alexandra Olteanu; Luke McDowell; Karl Aberer,Users of today's information networks need to digest large amounts of data. Therefore; toolsthat ease the task of filtering the relevant content are becoming necessary. One way toachieve this is to identify the users who generate content in a certain topic of interest.However; due to the diversity and ambiguity of the shared information; assigning users totopics in an automatic fashion is challenging. In this demo; we present Topick; a system thatleverages state of the art techniques and tools to automatically distill high-level topics for agiven user. Topick exploits both the user stream and her profile information to accuratelyidentify the most relevant topics. The results are synthesised as a set of stars associated toeach topic; designed to give an intuition about the topics encompassed in the user streamsand the confidence in the results.

ConDense: managing data in community-driven mobile geosensor networks,Sebastian Cartier; Saket Sathe; Dipanjan Chakraborty; Karl Aberer,Effectively managing the data generated by community-driven mobile geo-sensor networksis a new and challenging problem. One important step for managing and querying sensornetwork data is to create abstractions of the data in the form of models. These models canthen be stored; retrieved; and queried; as required. There has been significant amount ofprior literature on using models for query processing [1]-[5]. On the contrary; however; therehas been a lack of understanding on developing reliable models; considering the uniquecharacteristics of community-driven geo-sensor networks. In an effort to correct this situation;this paper proposes various approaches for modeling the data from a community-drivenmobile geo-sensor network.

An End-to-End System for Cleaning Sensor Data: Model-Based Approaches,Hoyoung Jeung; Sofiane Sarni; Ioannis Paparrizos; Saket Sathe; Karl Aberer,Abstract Due to the erroneous and inaccurate nature of sensor data; data cleaning is anessential task before the data is used by applications in sensor networks. In this paper; wepresent an end-to-end data cleaning system that detects anomalies from streaming sensordata; stores cleaned data; generates and manages metadata indicating 'dirty values' in ametadata management system; and processes joins between the metadata and itsassociated raw sensor data. Our system performs all of this pipelined processing in a fullyautomated manner; using only simple configurations. The key component of our system is amodel-based anomaly detector that employs various mathematical models for identifyingoutliers in sensor data.

Processing publish/subscribe queries over distributed data streams,Oana Jurca; Sebastian Michel; Alexandre Herrmann; Karl Aberer,Abstract We address the problem of processing continuous multi-join queries; overdistributed data streams; making use of existing work in the field of publish/subscribesystems. We show how these principles can be ported to data streams; by enriching thecommon query model with location dependent attributes. Users can subscribe to a set ofsensor attributes; a service that requires processing multi-join correlation queries. The goalis to decrease the overall network traffic consumption by removing redundant subscriptionsand eliminating unrequested events close to the publishing sensors. This is non-trivial;especially in the presence of multi-join queries without any central control mechanism. Ourapproach is based on the concept of filter-split-forward phases for efficient subscriptionfiltering and placement inside the network.

Query driven operator placement for complex event detection over data streams,Oana Jurca; Sebastian Michel; Alexandre Herrmann; Karl Aberer,Abstract. We consider the problem of efficiently processing subscrip-tion queries over datastreams in large-scale interconnected sensor networks. We propose a scalable algorithm fordistributed data stream processing; applicable on top of any platform granting access tointercon-nected sensor networks. We make use of a probabilistic algorithm to check whethersubscriptions are subsumed by other subscriptions and thus can be pruned for more efficientprocessing. Our proposed methods are query driven; hence do not replicate data streams;but intelligently place join operators inside the global network of sources.

Optimal caching for first-order query load-balancing in decentralized index structures,Anwitaman Datta; Wolfgang Nejdl; Karl Aberer,Abstract Balancing query-load in structured overlays is an important and mostly unattendedproblem; apart from heuristics to deal with hot-spots. We determine the optimal cachingstrategy-how many caches (dependent on relative frequency of queries) to reduce searchlatency and where to place these caches? Our query-adaptive replication scheme providesfirst-order balancing of query-load. We also elaborate the limitations of first-order balancing(ignored by all existing heuristics) though it should have been obvious given theexperiences of the P2P community with storage-load balancing. This work lays the groundfor our ongoing work on load-aware routing in structured overlays as a mechanismcomplementing caching to achieve query-load balancing.,*,2007,4

Trust-aware cooperation,Zoran Despotovic; Karl Aberer; Manfred Hauswirth,In mobile teamwork environments two basic problems exist: how to discover someonebased on a profile (skills; reputations) and how to assess that person's" credibility"(trust). Alot of work has been done on the issues of collecting and spreading reputations andsubsequent computation of trust. The application of such data for decision making; howeveris still missing.

Resource prediction for admission control of interactive multimedia sessions,Silvia Hollfelder; Karl Aberer,Abstract Interactive multimedia sessions have uncertain; varying consumption rates due tousers' interactive behavior. In this paper; we propose two approaches for prediction ofconsumption rates required for admission control. They differ in the assumptions of theavailable knowledge: The observation-based approach predicts the future consumption fromthe past system behavior. The stochastical approach requires a user behavior model fromwhich the prediction is deduced. We discuss the pros and cons of the two approaches withrespect to available information sources; accuracy of prediction; and suitable scenarios.,Int.

Towards visual support for document navigation through multidimensional catalogues,Thomas Klement; Matthias Hemmje; Karl Aberer,ABSTRACT In information systems applications; the “catalogue” concept is mostly used as aconnotation for information systems that categorize content by means of documentannotation hierarchies. Within user interfaces; catalogue metaphors are in wide spread use.To take advantage of more flexible and efficient catalogue navigation based onmultidimensional menu hierarchies a project about an integrated Information CatalogueEnvironment (ICE) is currently performed at GMD-IPSI. The goal of the ICE project is toprovide efficient and flexible catalogue oriented categorization and representationmechanisms for multimedia document types and structures.,Proceedings of the 1998 workshop on New paradigms in information visualization and manipulation,1998,4

A multiagent system for dynamic data aggregation in medical research,Alevtina Dubovitskaya; Visara Urovi; Imanol Barba; Karl Aberer; Michael Ignaz Schumacher,The collection of medical data for research purposes is a challenging and long-lastingprocess. In an effort to accelerate and facilitate this process we propose a new framework fordynamic aggregation of medical data from distributed sources. We use agent-basedcoordination between medical and research institutions. Our system employs principles ofpeer-to-peer network organization and coordination models to search over alreadyconstructed distributed databases and to identify the potential contributors when a newdatabase has to be built. Our framework takes into account both the requirements of aresearch study and current data availability. This leads to better definition of databasecharacteristics such as schema; content; and privacy parameters. We show that thisapproach enables a more efficient way to collect data for medical research.,BioMed research international,2016,3
Sigco: Mining significant correlations via a distributed real-time computation engine,Tian Guo; Jean-Paul Calbimonte; Hao Zhuang; Karl Aberer,The dramatic rise of time-series data produced in a variety of contexts; such as stockmarkets; mobile sensing; sensor networks; data centre monitoring; etc.; has fuelled thedevelopment of large-scale distributed real-time computation systems (eg; Apache Storm;Samza; Spark Streaming; S4; etc.). However; it is still unclear how certain time series miningtasks could be performed using such new emerging systems. In this paper; we focus on thetask of efficiently discovering statistically significant correlations among a large number oftime series via a distributed realtime computation engine. We propose a framework referredto as SigCO. In SigCO; we put forward a novel partition-aware data shuffling; which is able toadaptively shuffle time series data only to the relevant nodes of the distributed real-timecomputation engine. On the other hand; in SigCO we design a δ-hypercube structure …,Big Data (Big Data); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,3
Coshare: A cost-effective data sharing system for data center networks,Hao Zhuang; Imen Filali; Rameez Rahman; Karl Aberer,Numerous research groups and other organizations collect data from popular data sourcessuch as online social networks. This leads to the problem of data islands; wherein all thisdata is isolated and lying idly; without any use to the community at large. Using existingcentralized solutions such as Drop box to replicate data to all interested parties isprohibitively costly; given the large size of datasets. A practical solution is to use a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) approach to replicate data in a self-organized manner. However; existing P2Papproaches focus on minimizing downloading time without taking into account thebandwidth cost. In this paper; we present Co Share; a P2P inspired decentralized costeffective sharing system for data replication.

Reactive processing of RDF streams of events,Jean-Paul Calbimonte; Karl Aberer,Abstract Events on the Web are increasingly being produced in the form of data streams;and are present in many different scenarios and applications such as health monitoring;environmental sensing or social networks. The heterogeneity of event streams has raisedthe challenges of integrating; interpreting and processing them coherently. Semantictechnologies have shown to provide both a formal and practical framework to address someof these challenges; producing standards for representation and querying; such as RDF andSPARQL. However; these standards are not suitable for dealing with streams for events; asthey do not include the concpets of streaming and continuous processing. The idea of RDFstream processing (RSP) has emerged in recent years to fill this gap; and the researchcommunity has produced prototype engines that cover aspects including complex event …,International Semantic Web Conference,2015,3
Studying web content credibility by social simulation,Adam Wierzbicki; Paulina Adamska; Katarzyna Abramczuk; Thanasis Papaioannou; Karl Aberer; Emilia Rejmund,* Abstract The Internet has become an important source of information that significantlyaffects social; economical and political life. The content available in the Web is the basis forthe operation of the digital economy. Moreover; Web content has become essential for manyWeb users that have to make decisions. Meanwhile; more and more often we encounterWeb content of low credibility due to incorrect opinions; lack of knowledge; and; even worse;manipulation attempts for the benefit of the authors or content providers. While mechanismsfor the support of credibility evaluation in practice have been proposed; little is known abouttheir effectiveness; and about their influence on the global picture of Web content productionand consumption.

Privacy Enhanced Demand Response with Reputation-based Incentive Distribution,Matteo Vasirani; Tri Kurniawan Wijaya; Georgios Liassas; Karl Aberer,ABSTRACT Demand response (DR) is a Smart Grid application that aims at managingconsumption of electricity in response to supplyside signals. The exchange of sensitiveinformation (ie; electricity consumption data) between the consumers and the DR provider isnecessary for the functioning of DR; but at the same time it is an obstacle to its wide-spreadadoption; due to the related privacy concerns. This paper proposes the use of homomorphicencrypted user aggregation and reputation-based incentive distribution to address thetradeoff between enhancing user privacy and correctly assessing the contribution of eachuser to the demand reduction.,International Workshop on Demand Response,2014,3

More on castor: the scalable secure routing protocol for ad-hoc networks,Wojciech Galuba; Panos Papadimitratos; Marcin Poturalski; Karl Aberer; Zoran Despotovic; Wolfgang Kellerer,Abstract—Wireless ad hoc networks are inherently vulnerable; as any node can disrupt thecommunication of potentially any other node in the network. Many solutions to this problemhave been proposed. In this paper; we take a fresh and comprehensive approach;simultaneously addressing three aspects: security; scalability and adaptability to changingnetwork conditions. Our communication protocol; Castor; occupies a unique point in thedesign space: it does not use any control messages except simple packetacknowledgements; and each node makes routing decisions locally and independently ofother nodes without exchanging routing state with them. This novel design makes Castorresilient to a wide range of attacks and allows it to scale to large network sizes and to remainefficient under high mobility.

Peer-to-Peer Issue Tracking System: Challenges and Solutions,Vijay Srinivas Agneeswaran; Narendula Rammohan; Karl Aberer,Issue tracking1 tools such as Jira or Bugzilla have become important for softwaredevelopment; especially with distributed development teams becoming the norm in severalorganizations. It is interesting to see that some open source software come with their ownissue tracking systems; such as Eclipse bugzilla (https://bugs. eclipse. org/bugs/). However;these tools are centralized and are project specific. The software development communityneeds a decentralized; project independent issue tracking tool that enables the communityof users to share and have access to knowledge. By centralized; we mean that the existingissue tracking systems are managed centrally-with centralized control. Moreover; they arealso hosted on centralized servers. However; both these may not be attractive for the opensource community.

Probabilistic information integration and retrieval in the Semantic Web,Livia Predoiu,Abstract The Semantic Web (SW) has been envisioned to enable software tools or WebServices; respectively; to process information provided on the Web automatically. For thispurpose; languages for representing the semantics of data by means of ontologies havebeen proposed such as RDF (S) and OWL. While the semantics of RDF (S) requires a non-standard model-theory that goes beyond first order logics; OWL is intended to model subsetsof first order logics. OWL consists of three variants that are layered on each other. The lessexpressive variants OWL-Light and OWL-DL correspond to the Description Logics SHIF (D)and SHOIN (D) 1; respectively; and thus to subsets of First Order Logics 2.,*,2007,3

The P2P paradigm holdsmany promises; eg scalability; failure resilience and increased autonomy of nodes. Forthese reasons P2P seems also to be an interesting architectural paradigm for realizing largescale information retrieval systems. However; search methods in P2P networks are stillmostly limited to simple keyword queries and the use of advanced retrieval models is in itsinfancy.,ACM SIGIR Forum,2006,3
An extensible and personalized approach to QoS-enabled semantic web service discovery,Le-Hung Vu; Fabio Porto; Manfred Hauswirth; Karl Aberer,Abstract We present a framework for the autonomous discovery and selection of SemanticWeb services based on their QoS properties. The novelty of our approach is the wide use ofsemantic technologies for a customizable discovery; which enables both the service usersand providers to flexibly specify their matching models for QoS and the correspondingenvironmental conditions. In the presented approach; the discovery and ranking of servicescan be personalized via the use of domain ontologies detailing the user's preferences andthe provider's specification. The discovery component is modeled as an adaptive queryprocessing system in which the basic steps of filtering; matchmaking; reputation-based QoSassessment; and ranking of services correspond to logical algebraic operators; whichfacilitates the introduction of different discovery algorithms and the automatic generation …,*,2006,3

We validate our heuristics on a real collection of interconnected bioinformaticdatabases registered with the Sequence Retrieval System (SRS). Furthermore; we deriveand provide experimental evaluations of query propagation on weighted semantic networks;where weights model the quality of the various schema mappings in the network.,W8: Semantic Network Analysis,2005,3
On the convergence of structured search; information retrieval and trust management in distributed systems,Karl Aberer; Philippe Cudré-Mauroux; Zoran Despotovic,Abstract The database and information retrieval communities have long been recognized asbeing irreconcilable. Today; however; we witness a surprising convergence of thetechniques used by both communities in decentralized; large-scale environments. Thenewly emerging field of reputation based trust management; borrowing techniques from bothcommunities; best demonstrates this claim. We argue that incomplete knowledge andincreasing autonomy of the participating entities are the driving forces behind thisconvergence; pushing the adoption of probabilistic techniques typically borrowed from aninformation retrieval context. We argue that using a common probabilistic framework wouldbe an important step in furthering this convergence and enabling a common treatment andanalysis of distributed complex systems. We will provide a first sketch of such a framework …,German Conference on Multiagent System Technologies,2005,3
Using highly discriminative keys for indexing in a peer-to-peer full-text retrieval system,Toan Luu; Fabius Klemm; Martin Rajman; Karl Aberer,Abstract. Excessive network bandwidth consumption; caused by the transmission of longposting lists; was identified as one of the major bottlenecks for implementing distributed full-text retrieval in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture. To address this problem we introduce anovel approach to indexing using highly discriminative terms and term sets; which leads toshort posting lists and therefore reduces the network traffic by almost one order ofmagnitude. In addition; we show that retrieval based on discriminative term sets provides aretrieval quality comparable to standard full-text retrieval using TF-IDF ranking. Our indexingscheme is an important improvement towards realistic P2P retrieval systems that opens theopportunity to virtually unlimited scalability well beyond the capacity of today's bestcentralized Web search engines.,Technical Report 2005041,2005,3

Peer-to-peer systems are characterized as beingdecentralized; self-organizing distributed systems; in which all or most communication issymmetric. Peer-to-peer technologies are aimed for building large-scale distributed services.In particular peer-to-peer architectures could be used in the context of web and gridcomputing to provide scalable self-organizing resources/services.

In particular; we focus on campaigns related to climate change onTwitter; which promote online activism to encourage; educate; and motivate people to reactto the various issues raised by climate change. We propose a generic framework to identifyboth the type of a given campaign as well as the various actions undertaken throughout itslifespan: official meetings; physical actions; calls for action; publications on climate relatedresearch; etc. We study whether the type of a campaign is correlated to the actions …,International Conference on Social Informatics,2016,2
Data-Driven Privacy Indicators.,Hamza Harkous; Rameez Rahman; Karl Aberer,ABSTRACT Third party applications work on top of existing platforms that host users' data.Although these apps access this data to provide users with specific services; they can alsouse it for monetization or profiling purposes. In practice; there is a significant gap betweenusers' privacy expectations and the actual access levels of 3rd party apps; which are oftenover-privileged. Due to weaknesses in the existing privacy indicators; users are generallynot well-informed on what data these apps get. Even more; we are witnessing the rise ofinverse privacy: 3rd parties collect data that enables them to know information about usersthat users do not know; cannot remember; or cannot reach [2]. In this paper; we describe ourrecent experiences with the design and evaluation of Data-Driven Privacy Indicators(DDPIs); an approach attempting to reduce the aforementioned privacy gap.

Please Sign to Save...: How Online Environmental Petitions Succeed.,Julia Proskurnia; Karl Aberer; Philippe Cudré-Mauroux,Abstract Social media have become one of the key platforms to support the debate onclimate change. In particular; Twitter allows easy information dissemination when runningenvironmental campaigns. Yet; the dynamics of these campaigns on social platforms stillremain largely unexplored. In this paper; we study the success factors enabling onlinepetitions to attain their required number of signatures. We present an analysis of e-petitionsand identify how their number of users; tweets and retweets correlate with their success. Inaddition; we show that environmental petitions are actively promoted by popular publiccampaigns on Twitter. Finally; we present an annotated corpus of petitions posted byenvironmental campaigns together with their corresponding tweets to enable furtherexploration.,EcoMo@ ICWSM,2016,2
Tree-structured classifier for acceleration-based activity and gesture recognition on smartwatches,Joseph Korpela; Takuya Maekawa; Julien Eberle; Dipanjan Chakraborty; Karl Aberer,This paper proposes a new method for recognizing both activities and gestures by usingacceleration data collected on a smartwatch. While both activity recognition techniques andgesture recognition techniques employ acceleration data; these techniques are studiedindependently due to the large difference between the characteristics of activity sensor dataand gesture sensor data. In this study; we combine their recognition using a tree structuredclassifier that combines features that are widely used to recognize activities with dynamictime warping-based k-nearest neighbor classifiers. Our method can recognize both activitiesand gestures with low computational cost by executing only the minimal set of featureextraction and classification processes that are required to recognize an input sensor-datasegment.

Detection of hypoglycemic events through wearable sensors,Jean-Eudes Ranvier; Fabien Dubosson; Jean-Paul Calbimonte; Karl Aberer,Abstract. Diabetic patients are dependent on external substances to balance their bloodglucose level. In order to control this level; they historically needed to sample a drop a bloodfrom their hand and have it analyzed. Recently; other directions emerged to offer alternativeways to estimate glucose level. In this paper; we present our ongoing work on a frameworkfor inferring semantically annotated glycemic events on the patient; which leverages mobilewearable sensors on a sport-belt.,Proceedings of the International Workshop on Semantic Web Technologies for Mobile and PErvasive Environments 2016,2016,2
An economic analysis of pervasive; incentive-based demand response,Tri Kurniawan Wijaya; Matteo Vasirani; Jonas Christoffer Villumsen; Karl Aberer,Demand response (DR) emerges as one of the cheapest and greenest solutions to matchsupply and demand in the electricity sector. While DR has been focused on large andindustrial consumers; pervasive implementation (by including residential consumers) isneeded to maximize its potential. This paper presents theoretical analysis of pervasive;incentive-based DR from the economics perspective. Our analysis consider cases whether(1) DR is used to encourage consumers to decrease or increase their demand; and (2) utilitycompanies have access to a single or multiple energy sources. We determine the necessaryconditions and derive the optimal incentives to benefit from DR events.,Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,2

Where are the rdf streams?: Deploying rdf streams on the web of data with triplewave,Andrea Mauri; Jean-Paul Calbimonte; Marco Balduini; Emanuele Della Valle; Karl Aberer,Abstract. RDF Stream Processing (RSP) bridges the gap between semantic technologiesand data stream systems. Although a number of RSP systems have been recently proposed;no RDF streams are actually made publicly available on the Web. To cope with this; RSPengines require ad-hoc wrappers in order to be fed from non-RDF streams available on theInternet. In this paper we present TripleWave: an approach for publishing existing streamson the Web as RDF streams; using mappings to perform live transformation of data; andfollowing the Linked Data principles. We implemented and deployed TripleWave for aconcrete use-case: a live feed of updates of Wikipedia.,14th International Semantic Web Conference ISWC,2015,2
Using Identity Premium for Honesty Enforcement and Whitewashing Prevention,Le‐Hung Vu; Jie Zhang; Karl Aberer,Abstract One fundamental issue with existing reputation systems; particularly thoseimplemented in open and decentralized environments; is whitewashing attacks byopportunistic participants.

Energy-efficient opportunistic collaborative sensing,Julien Eberle; Zhixian Yan; Karl Aberer,This paper studies mobile sensing in a complete distributed and opportunistic scheme. Wepresent a novel sensing strategy for sensing nodes without movement constraints. Thisstrategy offers information sharing and sensor scheduling that maximizes the benefits fromcollaboration between the nodes. We evaluate the strategy with two real world datasets;where mobile devices sense the surroundings and share the information with nearbydevices via Bluetooth. We show that data sharing of energy-hungry sensing (eg; GPS) vianearby devices can save a substantial amount of energy. Moreover; we formulate the offlinemeasurement scheduling as a non-linear optimization problem and compare the offlineoptimal results with our online scheduling performance.,Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems (MASS); 2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on,2013,2

Semantic Trajectories,Zhixian Yan,Abstract Thanks to the rapid development of mobile sensing technologies (like GPS; GSM;RFID; accelerometer; gyroscope; sound and other sensors in smartphones); the largescalecapture of evolving positioning data (called mobility data or trajectories) generated bymoving objects with embedded sensors has become easily feasible; both technically andeconomically. We have already entered a world full of trajectories. The state-of-the-art ontrajectory; either from the moving object database area or in the statistical analysisviewpoint; has built a bunch of sophisticated techniques for trajectory data ad-hoc storage;indexing; querying and mining etc. However; most of these existing methods mainly focus ona spatio-temporal viewpoint of mobility data; which means they analyze only the geometricmovement of trajectories (eg; the raw< x; y; t> sequential data) without enough …,*,2011,2
Tracking hot-k items over Web 2.0 streams,Parisa Haghani; Sebastian Michel; Karl Aberer,Abstract: The rise of the Web 2.0 has made content publishing easier than ever. Yesterday'spassive consumers are now active users who generate and contribute new data to the webat an immense rate. We consider evaluating data driven aggregation queries which arise inWeb 2.0 applications. In this context; each user action is interpreted as an event in acorresponding stream eg; a particular weblog feed; or a photo stream. The presentedapproach continuously tracks the most popular tags attached to the incoming items andbased on this; constructs a dynamic top-k query. By continuous evaluation of this query onthe incoming stream; we are able to retrieve the currently hottest items. To limit the queryprocessing cost; we propose to pre-aggregate index lists for parts of the query which arelater on used to construct the full query result.

Knowing when to slide-efficient scheduling for sliding window processing,Ali Salehi; Mehdi Riahi; Sebastian Michel; Karl Aberer,We consider sliding window query execution scheduling in stream processing engines.Sliding windows are an essential building block to limit the query focus at a particular part ofthe stream; based either on value count or time ranges. These so called sliding windowpredicates specify the execution condition for the query. Due to the often massive amount ofregistered queries; efficient algorithms to check these predicates are essential. While thereexists a comprehensive set of works on the stream processing techniques; the actualalgorithms to intelligently decide on the sliding behaviors is not extensively addressed in theexisting works. In this paper we propose a set of algorithms for managing and sharingsliding decisions.

Data management in the social web,Karl Aberer,An interesting observation relates to the fact that the most successful applications on theWeb incorporate some sort of social mechanism. This is true for commercial success stories;such as Ebay with its reputation mechanism; Amazon with its recommendation tool andGoogle with PageRank; a recommendation-based ranking algorithm. Peer-to-peer filesharing and photo sharing are other recent examples were the essence of the applicationconsists of social interactions. In these applications large numbers of anonymousparticipants interact; such that mechanisms for social control become increasingly important.This explains the recent interest in reputation-based trust management. The same issueswill emerge when large numbers of services will be deployed over the Web through Webservices and Grid computing technology.,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2006,2
Indexing data-oriented overlay networks using belief propagation,Danny Bickson; Danny Dolev; Yair Weiss; Karl Aberer; Manfred Hauswirth,Abstract In this paper we discuss the problem of data-oriented partitioning in large-scaleoverlay networks; as required by peer-to-peer databases or by peer-to-peer informationretrieval. The goal is to partition a large set of nodes into k partitions with the additionalrequirement of meeting certain load-balancing constraints without global knowledge of thenetwork's parameters; ie; the desired number of partitions and the partition distributionfunction are not known in advance and change dynamically as the network evolves. This keyproblem in large-scale decentralized systems has so far received only very limited attention.The novel contributions described in the following are (1) the definition of a distributedalgorithm for local estimation of the partitioning distribution function; which does notpreclude the network's topology; and (2) a distributed method for performing the actual …,Proceedings of the Workshop on Distributed Data and Structures (WDAS); Santa Clara; CA; USA,2006,2

The work goes along the following twodimensions: P2P reputation systems design and building P2P e-commerce services andapplications. Enabling any kind of commerce has as the very first precondition providingappropriate assurance mechanisms that reduce or eliminate opportunistic behavior of theinvolved parties. Traditional forms of such mechanisms; such as contractual agreementsmonitored by enforcement institutions; are not always viable in an online world; particularlyin global decentralized communities such as P2P networks. Under such circumstances;reputation systems as informal social mechanisms for encouraging trustworthy behaviorappear to be the only remaining alternative.

Using siterank for p2p web retrieval,Karl Aberer; Jie Wu,Abstract Studies of the Web graph at the granularity of documents have revealed manyinteresting link distributions. Similarly; studies of the Web graph at the granularity of Websites; the so-called hostgraph; revealed relationships among hosts based on linkage and co-citation. However; to the best of our knowledge; the graph of Web sites has not beenexploited for the purpose of ranking in search engines. In this paper; we first identify thenecessity of a SiteGraph abstraction. We derive the SiteRank; a ranking of generalimportance among the Web sites in such a graph. We then show that SiteRank follows apower-law distribution. As experimental data set we were using the Web of our campus withover two million documents.

Separating business process from user interaction utilizing process-aware XSLT stylesheets,Karl Aberer; Anwitaman Datta; Zoran Despotovic,In the web context; it is difficult to disentangle presentation from process logic; andsometimes even data is not separate from the presentation. Consequently; it becomescrucial to define an abstract model for business processes; and their mapping into an activeuser interface presentation; using the principle of separation of concern between theprocess logic; data and its presentation aspects. We endeavour to extend declarative (rulebased) XSLT to accommodate the separation of process information from the data structureand presentation; and thus propose to design process aware stylesheets; in a minimallyinvasive manner. The isolation of the three otherwise entangled aspects of web-processesmakes it easy to develop and maintain web-applications in a more independent mannerwhere each individual developer can focus on his/her primary responsibility; like …,Advanced Issues of E-Commerce and Web-Based Information Systems; 2002.(WECWIS 2002).

Yet; crowd workers have wide-ranging levels of expertise. Large workerpopulations are heterogeneous and comprise a significant amount of faulty workers. As aconsequence; quality insurance for crowd answers is commonly seen as the Achilles heel ofcrowdsourcing. Although various techniques for quality control have been proposed inrecent years; a post-processing phase in which crowd answers are validated is still required.Such validation; however; is typically conducted by experts; whose availability is limited andwhose work incurs comparatively high costs.

If You Can't Beat them; Join them: A Usability Approach to Interdependent Privacy in Cloud Apps,Hamza Harkous; Karl Aberer,Abstract Cloud storage services; like Dropbox and Google Drive; have growing ecosystemsof 3rd party apps that are designed to work with users' cloud files. Such apps often requestfull access to users' files; including files shared with collaborators. Hence; whenever a usergrants access to a new vendor; she is inflicting a privacy loss on herself and on hercollaborators too. Based on analyzing a real dataset of 183 Google Drive users and 131third party apps; we discover that collaborators inflict a privacy loss which is at least 39%higher than what users themselves cause. We take a step toward minimizing this loss byintroducing the concept of History-based decisions. Simply put; users are informed atdecision time about the vendors which have been previously granted access to their data.Thus; they can reduce their privacy loss by not installing apps from new vendors …,Proceedings of the Seventh ACM on Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy,2017,1

In the case of energy datasets; acquiring datarepresents an obstacle to develop data-driven methods; due to prohibitive monetary andtime costs linked to the instrumentation of households in order to monitor the energyconsumption. More so; most datasets only contain pure power time series; despite labelsbeing required to determine when a device is in use from when it is idle (incurring stand-byconsumption or being off); and by extension to separate human activities triggering theconsumption from the baseline consumption.

On crowdsensed data acquisition using multi-dimensional point processes,Saket Sathe; Timos Sellis; Karl Aberer,Crowdsensing applications are increasing at a tremendous rate. In crowdsensing; mobilesensors (humans; vehicle-mounted sensors; etc.) generate streams of information that isused for inferring high-level phenomena of interest (eg; traffic jams; air pollution). Unliketraditional sensor network data; crowdsensed data has a highly skewed spatio-temporaldistribution caused largely due to the mobility of sensors [1]. Thus; designing systems thatcan mitigate this effect by acquiring crowdsensed at a fixed spatio-temporal rate are needed.In this paper we propose using multi-dimensional point processes (MDPPs); a mathematicalmodeling tool that can be effectively used for performing this data acquisition task.,Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW); 2015 31st IEEE International Conference on,2015,1

Performance analysis of data processing architectures for the Smart Grid,SN Akshay Uttama Nambi; Matteo Vasirani; R Venkatesha Prasad; Karl Aberer,Information and communication technology infrastructures play an important role to realizethe full potential of Smart Grid (SG) applications. Several architectures proposed in theliterature usually focus on communication requirement or data storage. However; it is still notclear which architecture best satisfies energy; storage; processing and communicationrequirements. The lack of understanding of key parameters; such as energy required;communication bandwidth; storage space; processing power; etc.; has hindered the largescale SG deployments. In this paper; we investigate different data processing architecturesfor hierarchical power distribution networks. We introduce several key cost indicators toanalyze hierarchical data processing architectures for the SG.

TransactiveDB: tapping into collective human memories,Michele Catasta; Alberto Tonon; Djellel Eddine Difallah; Gianluca Demartini; Karl Aberer; Philippe Cudre-Mauroux,Abstract Database Management Systems (DBMSs) have been rapidly evolving in the recentyears; exploring ways to store multi-structured data or to involve human processes duringquery execution. In this paper; we outline a future avenue for DBMSs supporting transactivememory queries that can only be answered by a collection of individuals connected througha given interaction graph. We present TransactiveDB and its ecosystem; which allow usersto pose queries in order to reconstruct collective human memories. We describe a set of newtransactive operators including TUnion; TFill; TJoin; and TProjection. We also describe howTransactiveDB leverages transactive operators---by mixing query execution; social networkanalysis and human computation---in order to effectively and efficiently tap into thememories of all targeted users.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,1
Fast correlation discovery for large-scale streaming time-series data,Tian Guo; Saket Sathe; Karl Aberer,The dramatic rise of streaming time-series data produced in a vari-ety of contexts; such asstock markets; mobile sensing; sensor net-works; data centre monitoring; etc.; has fuelledthe development of large-scale distributed real-time computation systems (eg; ApacheStorm; Spark Streaming; S4; etc.). However; it is still unclear how certain important tasks;which can be performed with relative ease in a centralized system; could be performedusing such distributed systems. In this paper; we focus on one such task of continu-ouslydiscovering correlations among a large number of stream-ing time series. While doing so;we address two key challenges:(1) the number of time-series pairs that have to be analyzedgrows quadratically (O (n2)) in the number of time-series n; giving rise to a quadraticincrease in the communication cost between differ-ent nodes of the distributed system;(2) …,*,2014,1
Characterizing the Optimal Incentives for Pervasive Demand Response,Tri Kurniawan Wijaya; Matteo Vasirani; Jonas Christoffer Villumsen; Karl Aberer,ABSTRACT While Demand Response (DR) has been focused on large and industrialconsumers; pervasive implementation (by including residential consumers) is needed tomaximize its potential. This paper presents analyses from the economics perspective ofpervasive; incentive-based DR; and consider cases whether (1) DR is used to encourageconsumers to decrease or increase their demand; and (2) utility companies have access to asingle or multiple energy sources. We derive the necessary conditions and the optimalincentives to benefit from DR events.,*,2014,1
A Cost-Benefit Analysis of Data Processing Architectures for the Smart Grid,Uttama Nambi; SN Akshay; Matteo Vasirani; R Venkatesha Prasad; Karl Aberer,ABSTRACT Information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure plays animportant role to realize the full potential of Smart Grid applications. Smart grids utilize ICTentities to enhance efficiency; reliability and sustainability of power generation anddistribution network. Majority of the architectures proposed hitherto focus only on a specificarchitectural aspect; like communication; storage; processing requirement; etc. Recentstudies have shown that lack of knowledge on which architecture best satisfies certaininformation management requirements has hindered large scale smart grid deployments. Inthis paper; we investigate the cost-benefit analysis of four data processing architectures forvarious applications in smart grid.

Reconciling schema matching networks,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen,Abstract Schema matching is the process of establishing correspondences between theattributes of schemas; for the purpose of data integration. Schema matching is oftenperformed in a pair-wise setting; in which two given schemas are matched again each otherby automatic tools. In this thesis; we instead approach the schema matching problem in anetwork setting; in which the two schemas to be matched do not exist in isolation butparticipate in a larger matching network and connect to several other schemas at the sametime; coined the term schema matching network. The notion of schema matching network isnovel in its own right and is beneficial in many real world scenarios; including largeenterprises and mashup applications. There is a large body of work on schema matchingtechniques; numerous commercial and academic schema matching tools; called …,*,2014,1

EnviroMeter: A platform for querying community-sensed data,Saket Sathe; Arthur Oviedo; Dipanjan Chakraborty; Karl Aberer,Abstract Efficiently querying data collected from Large-area Community driven SensorNetworks (LCSNs) is a new and challenging problem. In our previous works; we proposedadaptive techniques for learning models (eg; statistical; nonparametric; etc.) from such data;considering the fact that LCSN data is typically geo-temporally skewed. In this paper; wepresent a demonstration of EnviroMeter. EnviroMeter uses our adaptive model creationtechniques for processing continuous queries on community-sensed environmentalpollution data. Subsequently; it efficiently pushes current pollution updates to GPS-enabledsmartphones (through its Android application) or displays it via a web-interface. Weexperimentally demonstrate that our model-based query processing approach is orders ofmagnitude efficient than processing the queries over indexed raw data.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,1
Sustainable energy consumption monitoring in residential settings,SN Uttama-Nambi; Thanasis G Papaioannou; Dipanjan Chakraborty; Karl Aberer,Abstract—The continuous growth of energy needs and the fact that unpredictable energydemand is mostly served by unsustainable (ie fossil-fuel) power generators have given riseto the development of Demand Response (DR) mechanisms for flattening energy demand.Building effective DR mechanisms and user awareness on power consumption cansignificantly benefit from fine-grained monitoring of user consumption at the appliance level.However; installing and maintaining such a monitoring infrastructure in residential settingscan be quite expensive. In this paper; we study the problem of fine-grained appliance power-consumption monitoring based on one houselevel meter and few plug-level meters. Weexplore the trade-off between monitoring accuracy and cost; and exhaustively find theminimum subset of plug-level meters that maximize accuracy.

Towards enabling schema reuse with privacy constraints,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen; Son Thanh Do; Tam Nguyen Thanh; Karl Aberer,Abstract As the number of schema repositories grows rapidly and several web-basedplatforms exist to support publishing schemas; schema reuse becomes a new trend.Schema reuse is a methodology that allows users to create new schemas by copying andadapting existing ones. This methodology supports to reduce not only the effort of designingnew schemas but also the heterogeneity between them. One of the biggest barriers ofschema reuse is privacy concerns that discourage the participants from contributing theirschemas. Addressing this problem; we develop a framework that enables privacy-preservingschema reuse. To this end; our framework supports users to define their own protectionpolicies in the form of privacy constraints. Instead of showing original schemas; theframework returns an anonymized schema with maximal utility while satisfying these …,*,2013,1

Keynote: OpenSense: Open sensor networks for air quality monitoring,Karl Aberer,Wireless sensor networks and publishing of sensor data on the Internet bear the potential tosubstantially increase public awareness and involvement in environmental sustainability. Airpollution monitoring in urban areas is a prime example of such an application as commonair pollutants have direct effect on the human health. However; bringing the vision of publicinvolvement in environmental monitoring to a reality poses today substantial technicalchallenges for the communication and information systems infrastructure; to scale up fromisolated well controlled systems to an open and scalable infrastructure. In this talk weprovide first an overview of the OpenSense project for air pollution monitoring. OpenSensetakes a holistic; end-to-end systems perspective.

Analyzing the Emergence of Semantic Agreement among Rational Agents,Golnaz Vakili; Thanasis G Papaioannou; Karl Aberer; Siavash Khorsandi,To days complex online applications often require the interaction of multiple services thatpotentially belong to different business entities. Interoperability is a core element of such anenvironment; yet not a straightforward one. In this paper; we argue that the emergence ofinteroperability is an economic process among rational agents and; although interoperabilitycan be mutually beneficial for the involved parties; it is also costly and may fail to emerge. Asa sample scenario; we consider the emergence of semantic interoperability among rationalservice agents in the service-oriented architectures (SOA) and analyze their individualeconomic incentives with respect to utility; risk and cost. We model this process as a positive-sum game and study its equilibrium and evolutionary dynamics.

Automated Model-driven Simulation and Visualization of Field Sensor Data,Thanasis G Papaioannou; Sofiane Sarni; Karl Aberer; Silvia Simoni; Marc Parlange; Mathias Bavay; Michael Lehning,Environmental models (eg GEOtop; Alpine3D; etc.) are very useful for understandingcomplex physical processes and predict potential natural hazards. However; running amodel-driven simulation based on field sensor data needs several steps; namely datasensing; aggregation; retrieval; cleaning; interpolation; formatting; model execution andmodel output visualization. This process is time-consuming (eg only the data preparation fora single simulation typically takes 3-4 days) and highly error-prone; as it involves manymanual or semi-automated steps. Furthermore; the scientists need to employ many differentsoftware tools for the various data processing steps; and often manually import data andexport the results from the tools.

PANACEA: Tunable privacy for access controlled data in peer-to-peer systems,Narendula Rammohan; Thanasis G Papaioannou; Karl Aberer,Abstract—Peer-to-peer paradigm is increasingly employed for organizing distributedresources for various applications; eg content distribution; open storage grid etc. In openenvironments; even when proper access control mechanisms supervise the access to theresources; privacy issues may arise depending on the application. In this paper; weintroduce; PANACEA; a system that offers high and tunable privacy based on an innovativeresource indexing approach. In our case; privacy has two aspects: the deducibility of aresource's existence/non-existence and the discovery of the provider of the resource.

Employing probabilistic reasoning;we quantify the privacy and analytically derive that PANACEA can offer high privacy …,*,2010,1
ProtoPeer: Bridging the Gap Between Simulation and Live Deployment,Wojciech Galuba; K Aberer; Z Despotovic; W Kellerer,Abstract Simulators are a commonly used tool in peer-to-peer systems research. However;they may not be able to capture all the details of a system operating in a live in the network.Transitioning from simulation to the actual system implementation is a non-trivial and time-consuming task. We present ProtoPeer; a peer-to-peer systems prototyping toolkit thatallows for switching between the event-driven simulation and live network deploymentwithout changing any of the application code. ProtoPeer exports a set of APIs for messagepassing; message queuing; timer operations as well as overlay routing and managing theoverlay neighbors. Users can plug in their own custom implementations of most of the partsof ProtoPeer including custom network models for simulation and custom message passingover transports other than the default TCP/UDP.

Probabilistic estimation quality ratings of online services,Le-Hung Vu; Karl Aberer,Abstract Accurate estimation of quality of online services is both an important and difficultproblem; since a service has many interdependent quality attributes influenced by severalcontextual factors. It is even more challenging as quality ratings come from sources withunknown reliability; each source may rate a service on different quality aspects. Althoughseveral solutions have been proposed; there is little work addressing all these issuesthoroughly. In this paper; we show that domain knowledge on service structure and relatedconstraints; such as causal dependencies among quality attributes and contextual factors;while widely available; can be exploited to effectively address the above issues in atheoretically-sound framework. Theoretical analysis shows that computational cost of theapproach is acceptable; and accurate evaluation of service quality requires a reasonable …,*,2008,1
Sharing of probabilistically correlated data in peer-to-peer networks,Roman SChMIDT,Abstract The impact of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks on the Internet landscape is undisputed.It has led to a series of new applications; eg; as part of the socalled Web 2.0. The shift fromthe classical client-server based paradigm of the Internet; with a clear distinction betweeninformation providers and consumers; towards consumers sharing information among eachother led to the rise of the P2P paradigm. The distributed setting enables users to share theircontent autonomously and locally; ie; information remains at computers at the edge of theInternet and is not gathered and organized at central servers. Structured overlay networkswere designed to organize the huge quantity of data shared in P2P networks by building aglobal; though distributed; index of shared information. Whereas the initial aim of thesesystems was to provide efficient lookup operations for single keyword operations; the …,*,2008,1

2.2. Belief Propagation on Uncertain Schema Mappings in Peer Data Management Systems,Philippe Cudré-Mauroux; Karl Aberer,Abstract. Until recently; most data integration techniques involved central components; eg;global schemas; to enable transparent access to heterogeneous databases. Today;however; with the democratization of tools facilitating knowledge elicitation in machine-processable formats; one cannot rely on global; centralized schemas anymore asknowledge creation and consumption are getting more and more dynamic anddecentralized. Peer Data Management Systems (PDMS) provide an answer to this problemby eliminating the central semantic component and considering instead compositions oflocal; pair-wise mappings to propagate queries from one database to the others. In thefollowing; we give an overview of various PDMS approaches; all the approaches proposedso far make the implicit assumption that all schema mappings used to reformulate a query …,EMERGING COMMUNICATION,2006,1
Distributed link-based ranking in P2P Web retrieval,Jie Wu,One of the main differences between modern search engines and traditional ones is theadoption of link-based ranking algorithm in ordering Web documents. Google has claimedthat it is its link-based ranking algorithm; PageRank that has made the quality of its searchresults superior. However; existing link-based ranking algorithms are mostly logicallycentralized although techniques of distributed data management and load balancing havebeen used in search engines to improve the performance and availability of the systems.With the scale of the Web becoming larger and larger; the scalability of traditional searchengines is very much limited by the current centralized algorithms; models; andarchitectures. The centralization in link-based ranking computation has brought in severalcritical problems that are hard to solve: centralized bottleneck and single point of failure …,*,2006,1
Probabilistic Estimation of Peers’ Quality and Behaviors for Subjective Trust Evaluation,Le-Hung Vu; Karl Aberer,Abstract The management of trust and quality in decentralized systems has been recognizedas a key research area over recent years. In this paper; we propose a probabilisticcomputational approach to enable a peer in the system to model and estimate the qualityand behaviors of the others subjectively according to its own preferences. Our solution isbased on the use of graphical models to represent the dependencies among different QoSparameters of a service provided by a peer; the associated contextual factors; the innatebehaviors of the reporters and their feedback on quality of the peer being evaluated. Weapply the EM algorithm to learn the conditional probabilities of the introduced variables andperform necessary probabilistic inferences on the constructed model to estimate peer'squality and behaviors. Interestingly; our proposed framework can be shown as the …,*,2006,1
Agents,Munindar P Singh; Michael N Huhns,Given that we are now able to to build and use individual services; it is only natural that weshould want to put services together to create more sophisticated and valuable services.Service composition is about putting together services to create new functionality. Often; thecomposed functionality would itself be exposed as a new service with a standard interface.Let us consider some challenges faced while composing services. Imagine that a merchantwould like to enable a customer to be able to track the shipping of a sold item. Currently; thebest that the merchant can do is to point the customer to the shipper's Web site; and thecustomer can then go there to check on delivery status. If the merchant could compose itsown production notification system with the shipper's Web services; the result would be acustomized delivery notification service by which the customer—or the customer's agents …,Service-Oriented Computing: Semantics; Processes; Agents,2005,1
Semantic Gossiping: Coping with Heterogeneous Semantic Knowledge Management Systems in the Large,Karl Aberer; Philippe Cudré-Mauroux,With the creation and wide adoption of Semantic Web standards like RDF or OWL; a newbreed of semantic networks is about to appear. For the first time; we can expect largenumbers of knowledge management systems to interoperate using common languages toexpress the semantics of the data they share or seek. We however foresee semanticheterogeneity to surface once more as a key problem in information integration; given thescale and variety of the systems we are dealing with: Indeed; we realistically cannot expectcommon global upper-ontologies to capture with sufficient adequacy the requirements of allthe different parties in our heterogeneous environment. Custom ontologies will bedeveloped for various application needs; thus endangering global semantic interoperabilityby introducing local concepts and properties.

Experimental evaluation results of an advanced DHT-based peer-to-peer system,Karl Aberer; Manfred Hauswirth; Roman Schmidt,Abstract P-Grid is a decentralized DHT-based peer-topeer system with logarithmic searchcomplexity. As it is intended to provide a platform for distributed information managementbeyond mere file-sharing it supports an update functionality with lazy consistencyguarantees; identity management disentangling the DHT from the underlying networkinginfrastructure; and decentralized load balancing. In this paper we first give a brief overviewof the theoretical foundations of P-Grid and the supporting functionalities. Then we highlightsome interesting implementation details and present briefly some experimental evaluationresults. To our knowledge this is one of the first reports on experimental evaluation results ofa structured peer-to-peer system in a real-world networking environment.,*,2004,1
Identifying peers using a self-contained directory,Karl Aberer; Anwitaman Datta; Manfred Hauswirth,Abstract PGP's “web of trust” approach provides basic identification facilities. One benefit ofthis approach is that it tries to lower the infrastructure requirements such that; for example;no certification authorities are required. In this paper we also pursue this objective but take iteven further. We present a self-contained P2P-based directory that provides similarguarantees for identification as PGP; and like PGP requires no dedicated; third-partyinfrastructure. The participating peers provide the infrastructure along with their normaloperation. But unlike PGP it does not require out-of-system mechanisms to disseminate thepublic key. Instead we exploit properties of the underlying P2P system to ensure correct keypublication and retrieval by probabilistic quorums. We argue that this is an efficient and morereliable mechanism compared to web-of-trust approaches.,*,2003,1

Gridella: A self-organizing P2P system,Karl Aberer; Manfred Hauswirth; Magdalena Punceva; Roman Schmidt,This paper describes our Gnutella compatible P2P system Gridella which is based on the P-Grid approach. P-Grid has several advantages over the standard Gnutella infrastructure; forexample; that probabilistic estimates can be given for successful search requests and that itscales gracefully in the total number of nodes and data items. Gridella is designed forinteroperability with Gnutella and the long-term goal is to replace the existing Gnutellainfrastructure with Gridella to make it more self-organizing and get around known problemsof Gnutella. On the basis of an analysis of Gnutella we describe the P-Grid approach and themapping algorithm that form the algorithmic foundations of Gridella. We present Gridella'sarchitecture and communication patterns and compare it with Gnutella.,*,2001,1
Transparent Integration of Continuous Media Support into a Multimedia DBMS,Silvia Hollfelder; Florian Schmidt; Matthias Hemmje; Karl Aberer; Arnd Steinmetz,Abstract Multimedia Database Management Systems (MM-DBMS) have to efficiently providethe specific functionalities required by time-dependent multimedia data types. Duringpresentation playout; this requires support for continuous data delivery and media-orientedoptimization of presentation quality according to user requirements. In this work; we showhow we integrated this type of support transparently with other MM-DBMS functions likemedia editing and querying. This is achieved by extending an existing data model forcontinuous media; in particular by means of stream abstractions for editing and presentation;and by extending the system architecture by means of supporting stream processingcomponents; eg; for intra-media synchronization by adaptation. This approach has beenimplemented as an extension of existing commercial objectrelational DBMS technology.,*,1997,1
Admissible Record-Oriented Evaluation Plans for Declarative Updates,Gisela Fischer; Karl Aberer,Abstract Efficient evaluation strategies for declarative updates have rarely been investigated.Due to possible dependencies between the resulting database state and the order in whichrecords (objects) are processed; usually declarative updates are evaluated in a set-orientedway in order to ensure a deterministic evaluation. In this paper; we show that suchdependencies can be detected by exploiting knowledge about conflicts between theoperations that are used to access the database during the update evaluation. Thus mostdeclarative updates can also be evaluated deterministically; and in some cases moreefficiently; in a record-oriented way. We show that some of the detected conflicts can berelaxed or even be ignored; while a deterministic evaluation can still be guaranteed.,Proceedings of the First East-European Symposium on Advances in Databases and Information Systems; (ADBIS'97); St Petersburg; 2-5 September 1997,1997,1

Autonomous Gossiping: A self-organizing epidemic algorithm for selective information dissemination in wireless mobile ad-hoc networks EPFL Technical Report: IC-...,Anwitaman Datta; Silvia Quarteroni; Karl Aberer,Abstract We introduce autonomous gossiping (A/G); a new genre epidemic algorithm forselective dissemination of information in contrast to previous usage of epidemic algorithmswhich flood the whole network. A/G is a paradigm which suits well in a mobile ad-hocnetworking (MANET) environment because it does not require any infrastructure ormiddleware like multicast tree and (un) subscription maintenance for publish/subscribe; butuses ecological and economic principles in a self-organizing manner in order to achieve anyarbitrary selectivity (flexible casting). The trade-off of using a stateless self-organizingmechanism like A/G is that it does not guarantee completeness deterministically as is one ofthe original objectives of alternate selective dissemination schemes like publish/subscribe.We argue that such incompleteness is not a problem in many non-critical real-life civilian …,*,*,1

In their current form; policies remain longand difficult to comprehend; thus merely serving the goal of legally protecting thecompanies. Short notices based on information extracted from privacy policies have beenshown to be useful and more usable; but face a significant scalability hurdle; given thenumber of policies and their evolution over time. Companies; users; researchers; andregulators still lack usable and scalable tools to cope with the breadth and depth of privacypolicies.

Efficient Document Filtering Using Vector Space Topic Expansion and Pattern-Mining: The Case of Event Detection in Microposts,Julia Proskurnia; Ruslan Mavlyutov; Carlos Castillo; Karl Aberer; Philippe Cudré-Mauroux,Abstract Automatically extracting information from social media is challenging given thatsocial content is often noisy; ambiguous; and inconsistent. However; as many stories breakon social channels first before being picked up by mainstream media; developing methodsto better handle social content is of utmost importance. In this paper; we propose a robustand effective approach to automatically identify microposts related to a specific topic definedby a small sample of reference documents. Our framework extracts clusters of semanticallysimilar microposts that overlap with the reference documents; by extracting combinations ofkey features that define those clusters through frequent pattern mining.

Taxonomy Induction using Hypernym Subsequences,Amit Gupta; Rémi Lebret; Hamza Harkous; Karl Aberer,Abstract We propose a novel; semi-supervised approach towards domain taxonomyinduction from an input vocabulary of seed terms. Unlike all previous approaches; whichtypically extract direct hypernym edges for terms; our approach utilizes a novel probabilisticframework to extract hypernym subsequences. Taxonomy induction from extractedsubsequences is cast as an instance of the minimum-cost flow problem on a carefullydesigned directed graph. Through experiments; we demonstrate that our approachoutperforms state-of-the-art taxonomy induction approaches across four languages.Importantly; we also show that our approach is robust to the presence of noise in the inputvocabulary. To the best of our knowledge; this robustness has not been empirically provenin any previous approach.,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,*

Multimodal Classification for Analysing Social Media,Chi Thang Duong; Remi Lebret; Karl Aberer,Abstract: Classification of social media data is an important approach in understanding userbehavior on the Web. Although information on social media can be of different modalitiessuch as texts; images; audio or videos; traditional approaches in classification usuallyleverage only one prominent modality. Techniques that are able to leverage multiplemodalities are often complex and susceptible to the absence of some modalities. In thispaper; we present simple models that combine information from different modalities toclassify social media content and are able to handle the above problems with existingtechniques. Our models combine information from different modalities using a pooling layerand an auxiliary learning task is used to learn a common feature space.

Predicting the Success of Online Petitions Leveraging Multidimensional Time-Series,Julia Proskurnia; Przemyslaw Grabowicz; Ryota Kobayashi; Carlos Castillo; Philippe Cudré-Mauroux; Karl Aberer,Abstract Applying classical time-series analysis techniques to online content is challenging;as web data tends to have data quality issues and is often incomplete; noisy; or poorlyaligned. In this paper; we tackle the problem of predicting the evolution of a time series ofuser activity on the web in a manner that is both accurate and interpretable; using relatedtime series to produce a more accurate prediction. We test our methods in the context ofpredicting signatures for online petitions using data from thousands of petitions posted onThe Petition Site-one of the largest platforms of its kind. We observe that the success ofthese petitions is driven by a number of factors; including promotion through social mediachannels and on the front page of the petitions platform. We propose an interpretable modelthat incorporates seasonality; aging effects; self-excitation; and external effects. The …,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web,2017,*
Hybrid Neural Networks over Time Series for Trend Forecasting,Tao Lin; Tian Guo; Karl Aberer,Abstract: The trend of time series characterize the intermediate upward and downwardpatterns of time series. Learning and forecasting the trend in time series data play animportant role in many real applications; ranging from resource allocation in data centers;load schedule in smart grid and so on. Inspired by the recent successes of neural networks;in this paper we propose TreNet; a novel hybrid neural network based learning approachover time series and the associated trend sequence. TreNet leverages convolutional neuralnetworks (CNNs) to extract salient features from local raw data of time series and uses along-short term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM) to capture the sequentialdependency in historical trend evolution.

deepschema. org: An Ontology for Typing Entities in the Web of Data,Panayiotis Smeros; Amit Gupta; Michele Catasta; Karl Aberer,ABSTRACT Discovering the appropriate type of an entity in the Web of Data is stillconsidered an open challenge; given the complexity of the many tasks it entails. Amongthem; the most notable is the definition of a generic and cross-domain ontology. While theontologies proposed in the past function mostly as schemata for knowledge bases ofdifferent sizes; an ontology for entity typing requires a rich; accurate and easily-traversabletype hierarchy. Likewise; it is desirable that the hierarchy contains thousands of nodes andmultiple levels; contrary to what a manually curated ontology can offer. Such level of detail isrequired to describe all the possible environments in which an entity exists in. Furthermore;the generation of the ontology must follow an automated fashion; combining the most widelyused data sources and following the speed of the Web.

Semantic representation and processing of hypoglycemic events derived from wearable sensor data,Jean-Paul Calbimonte; Jean-Eudes Ranvier; Fabien Dubosson; Karl Aberer,Abstract Diabetes Type 1 is a metabolic disease which results in a lack of insulin production;causing high glucose levels in the blood. It is crucial for diabetic patients to balance thisglucose level; and they depend on external substances to do so. In order to keep this levelunder control; they usually need to resort to invasive glucose control methods; such astaking a sample drop of blood from their finger and have it analyzed. Recently; otherdirections emerged to offer alternative ways to estimate glucose level; using indirect sensormeasurements including ECG monitoring and other physiological parameters. This papershowcases a framework for inferring semantically annotated glycemic events on the patient;which leverages data from mobile wearable sensors deployed on a sport-belt.

Efficient Distributed Decision Trees for Robust Regression,Tian Guo; Konstantin Kutzkov; Mohamed Ahmed; Jean-Paul Calbimonte; Karl Aberer,Abstract The availability of massive volumes of data and recent advances in data collectionand processing platforms have motivated the development of distributed machine learningalgorithms. In numerous real-world applications large datasets are inevitably noisy andcontain outliers. These outliers can dramatically degrade the performance of standardmachine learning approaches such as regression trees. To this end; we present a noveldistributed regression tree approach that utilizes robust regression statistics; statistics thatare more robust to outliers; for handling large and noisy data. We propose to integrate robuststatistics based error criteria into the regression tree. A data summarization method isdeveloped and used to improve the efficiency of learning regression trees in the distributedsetting.

A Heuristic Algorithm for Mobility-aware Location Obfuscation,Berker Agir; Iris Safaka; Malik Beytrison; Karl Aberer,Abstract—Mobile users not only use on-demand location-based services increasingly (eg;checking in on online social networks); but also other mobile applications that provide aservice based on location traces of users (eg; fitness tracking; health monitoring; etc.). Thistype of continuous tracking of user location introduces specific challenges to protection oflocation-privacy of mobile users. One of the challenges is ensuring the preservation ofprivacy levels of user location over time. Also; it is essential to build a location obfuscationarea that results in high confusion for an adversary. In this paper; we address thesechallenges by proposing and evaluating a heuristic obfuscation algorithm that is mobilityaware. Specifically; our heuristic algorithm reasons about a user's next location by takinginto account user mobility history and direction of movement. Our experiments show that …,*,2016,*

SMART: A tool for analyzing and reconciling schema matching networks,Hung Nguyen Quoc Viet; Tam Nguyen Thanh; Vinh Chau; Tri Kurniawan Wijaya; Zoltan Miklos; Karl Aberer; Avigdor Gal; Matthias Weidlich,Abstract—Schema matching supports data integration by establishing correspondencesbetween the attributes of independently designed database schemas. In recent years;various tools for automatic pair-wise matching of schemas have been developed. Since thematching process is inherently uncertain; the correspondences generated by such tools areoften validated by a human expert. In this work; we consider scenarios in which attributecorrespondences are identified in a network of schemas and not only in a pairwise setting.Here; correspondences between different schemas are interrelated; so that incomplete anderroneous matching results propagate in the network and the validation of acorrespondence by an expert has ripple effects.

To this end; many crowdsourcingplatforms feature a post-processing phase; in which crowd answers are validated by experts.This approach incurs high costs though; since expert input is a scarce resource. To supportthe expert in the validation process; we present a tool for ExpeRt guidance In validatingCrowd Answers (ERICA). It allows us to guide the expert's work by collecting input on themost problematic cases; thereby achieving a set of high quality answers even if the expertdoes not validate the complete answer set.

On the emergence of semantic agreement among rational agents,Golnaz Vakili; Thanasis G Papaioannou; Karl Aberer,Abstract Today's complex online applications often require the interaction of multiple (web)services that belong to potentially different business entities. Interoperability is a coreelement of such an environment; yet not a straightforward one due to the lack of commondata semantics. The problem is often approached by means of standardization proceduresin a top-down manner with limited adoption in practice.(De facto) standards for semanticinteroperability most commonly emerge in a bottom-up approach; ie; involving theinteraction and information exchange among self-interested industrial agents. In this paper;we argue that the emergence of semantic interoperability can be seen as an economicprocess among rational agents and; although interoperability can be mutually beneficial forthe involved parties; it may also be costly and might fail to emerge.

Pattern-wise trust assessment of sensor data,Robert Gwadera; Mehdi Riahi; Karl Aberer,One of the most important tasks of a sensor network (SN) is to detect occurrences ofinteresting events in the monitored environment. However; data measured by SN is oftenaffected by errors. We investigate the problem of assessing trustworthiness (trust) of asensor value (tested value) in the presence of events and errors. A usual approach is toexpress the trust as a deviation of the tested value from a reference value (a normal value).State of the art approaches aim at defining the reference value in terms of a contextconsisting of values of spatially proximate sensors that are correlated with the tested value.However; they trade accuracy for simplicity and use a fixed context consisting of values of afixed neighborhood (eg; All values within a circular neighborhood of radius r). Therefore;such a fixed context fails in most practical cases by under or overestimating the reference …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2014 IEEE 15th International Conference on,2014,*

Reconciling Schema Matching Networks Through Crowdsourcing.,Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung; Nguyen Thanh Tam; Zoltán Miklós; Karl Aberer,Abstract Schema matching is the process of establishing correspondences between theattributes of database schemas for data integration purposes. Although several automaticschema matching tools have been developed; their results are often incomplete orerroneous. To obtain a correct set of correspondences; usually human effort is required tovalidate the generated correspondences. This validation process is often costly; as it isperformed by highly skilled experts. Our paper analyzes how to leverage crowdsourcingtechniques to validate the generated correspondences by a large group of non-experts. Inour work we assume that one needs to establish attribute correspondences not onlybetween two schemas but in a network.

Towards Enabling Probabilistic Databases for Participatory Sensing,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen; Saket Sathe; Chi Thang Duong; Karl Aberer,Abstract—Participatory sensing has emerged as a new data collection paradigm; in whichhumans use their own devices (cell phone accelerometers; cameras; etc.) as sensors. Thisparadigm enables to collect a huge amount of data from the crowd for world-wideapplications; without spending cost to buy dedicated sensors. Despite of this benefit; thedata collected from human sensors are inherently uncertain due to no quality guaranteefrom the participants. Moreover; the participatory sensing data are time series that not onlyexhibit highly irregular dependencies on time; but also vary from sensor to sensor. Toovercome these issues; we study in this paper the problem of creating probabilistic data fromgiven (uncertain) time series collected by participatory sensors. We approach the problem intwo steps.

Model-Based Similarity Measure in TimeCloud,Ngo Thanh-Nguyen; Ho Young Jeung; Karl Aberer,Abstract. This paper presents a new approach to measuring similarity over massive time-series data. Our approach is built on two principles: one is to parallelize the large amountcomputation using a scalable cloud serving system; called TimeCloud. The another is tobenefit from the filter-and-refinement approach for query processing; such that similaritycomputation is efficiently performed over approximated data at the filter step; and then thefollowing refinement step measures precise similarities for only a small number ofcandidates resulted from the filtering. To this end; we establish a set of firm theoreticalbackgrounds; as well as techniques for processing kNN queries.

Distributed Information Systems Laboratory LSIR,Job Offers; Karl Aberer,This research addresses the problem of efficiently searching for resources in a decentralizedarchitecture. The goal is to rely for construction and maintenance on self-organizationprinciples to the largest degree possible without sacrificing efficiency [7]. The solution buildson a distributed indexing approach based on prefix routing; P-Grid; which has first beenpresented at COOPIS 2001 [1]. P-Grid combines the idea of constructing an efficient;distributed; prefix routing scheme; as used in distributed hash tables; with the flexibility ofnetwork maintenance as found in practical P2P systems; such as Gnutella or FreeNet [4][13].P-Grid has the inherent capability of storage load balancing without sacrificing searchefficiency [3][15][16][27].

Efficient Interest Group Discovery in Social Networks using an Integrated Structure/Quality Index.,Adriana Budura; Sebastian Michel; Karl Aberer,Abstract: We consider the problems of interest group discovery in a social network graphusing term-based topic descriptions. For a given query consisting of a set of terms; weefficiently compute a connected subset of users that jointly cover the query terms; based onthe annotation vocabulary utilized by users in the past. The presented approach is twofold;first we identify so-called seed users; centers of interest groups; that act as starting points ofthe group exploration. Subsequently; we inspect the seed users' neighborhoods and buildup the tree connecting the most promising neighbors. We demonstrate the applicability andefficiency of our method by conducting a series of experiments on data extracted from a Webportal showing that our method does not only provide accurate answers but calculates thesealso in an efficient way.,BTW,2011,*

Tunable Privacy for Access Controlled Data in Peer-to-Peer Systems,Narendula Rammohan; Thanasis G Papaioannou; Zoltán Miklós; Karl Aberer,Abstract—Peer-to-peer paradigm is increasingly employed for organizing distributedresources for various applications; eg content distribution; open storage grid etc. In openenvironments; even when proper access control mechanisms supervise the access to theresources; privacy issues may arise depending on the application. In this paper; weintroduce; PANACEA; a system that offers high and tunable privacy based on an innovativeresource indexing approach. In our case; privacy has two aspects: the deducibility of aresource's existence/non-existence and the discovery of the provider of the resource.

Employing both probabilistic andinformation-theoretic approaches; we analytically derive that PANACEA can offer high …,Proceedings of the 22nd International Teletraffic Congress (ITC 22),2010,*
Labelling Game for Twitter Streams,Hanser Valérian,The main goal of this project is to build a mean and to populate a database with correctinformation regarding some decided pairings. This database will then be compared to theresults of algorithms that process the same pairings; which provides a way to assessalgorithms' performance. The main focus is set on the following pairing; tweet messages andcompany. For a given set of tweet messages; we should be able to decide if either the wordrefers to the given company or not. In order to populate the database with such information;a web game application is used; which will allows any kind of users who wishes to play togive its feedback. We record those feedbacks and when enough feedbacks are collected;we may be able to build a subset of the correct information we want based on the feedbacks.,*,2010,*

Analyzing Trust Management Impact to Optimal Adversarial Attacks in Recommender Systems,Hung Le Vu; Thanasis G Papaioannou; Karl Aberer,Ranking systems; such as those in product review sites; and various recommender systemsusually employ user ratings to rank favorite items based on their quality and/or popularity.Since higher ranked items are more likely to be selected by customers and thus yield morerevenues for their providers; the latter with unpopular and low quality items have strongincentives to try to strategically manipulate their ranking. However; rank manipulationattempts are also costly; especially in the presence of trust management mechanisms. Thispaper analyzes the cost-effectiveness of adversary attack strategies for manipulating theserankings from various perspectives and identifies the optimal adversary strategies.Particularly; we analyze the probability of a successful attack by an adversary in relation with(1) its computational and financial power to generate a certain number of fake identities …,*,2010,*
A Publish/Subscribe Approach to Processing Continuous Queries Over Sensor Streams,Oana Anca Jurca,With technological advances; the sources of available information have become more andmore diverse. Recently; a new source of information has gained growing importance: sensordata. Sensors are devices sensing their environment in various ways and reporting ingeneral a numeric result. A sensor continuously reports values; thus the flow of informationis also continuous; like a stream. As the field has developed; the usage paradigm has shiftedfrom stand-alone sensors to interconnected sensors; or sensor networks. Sensors becamemore complex; generating larger quantities of data and having wireless communicationmodules for transmitting their data. Initially; data from sensor networks was first stored; andthen processed. Thus; classical database technologies could be used. However; the focushas soon shifted towards reacting to sensor data in real time. A user query reacting in real …,*,2010,*

Handling very large numbers of messages in Distributed Hash Tables,Fabius Klemm; Jean-Yves Le Boudec; Dejan Kostic; Karl Aberer,The principal service of distributed hash tables (DHTs) is route (id; data); which sends datato a peer responsible for id; using typically O (log (# of peers)) overlay hops. Certainapplications like peer-to-peer information retrieval generate billions of small messages thatare concurrently inserted into a DHT. These applications can generate messages faster thanthe DHT can process them. To support such demanding applications; a DHT needs acongestion control mechanism to efficiently handle high loads of messages. In this paper weprovide an extended study on congestion control for DHTs: we present a theoretical analysisthat demonstrates that congestion control for DHTs is absolutely necessary for applicationsthat provide elastic traffic. We then present a new congestion control algorithm for DHTs.

Designing peer-to-peer overlays,Šarunas Girdzijauskas,Abstract The Small-World phenomenon; well known under the phrase “six degrees ofseparation”; has been for a long time under the spotlight of investigation. The fact that oursocial network is closely-knitted and that any two people are linked by a short chain ofacquaintances was confirmed by the experimental psychologist Stanley Milgram in thesixties. However; it was only after the seminal work of Jon Kleinberg in 2000 that it wasunderstood not only why such networks exist; but also why it is possible to efficientlynavigate in these networks. This proved to be a highly relevant discovery for peer-to-peersystems; since they share many fundamental similarities with the social networks; inparticular the fact that the peer-to-peer routing solely relies on local decisions; without thepossibility to invoke global knowledge. In this thesis we show how peer-to-peer system …,*,2009,*
Implementing a NAT and Firewall traversal library,Damien Auroux,Network Address Translation (NAT)[1] is more and more widely used as a means to connectlocal area networks to the Internet. While this is a cheap and efficient way to share anInternet connection between multiple users; many network applications are unable to workproperly through these devices without complex configuration. However; there are sometechniques that can be used by an application in order to get through NAT devices andfirewalls without any manual configuration. The goal of this project is to implement them intoa simple library that software developers can easily use for developing network applications.,*,2009,*

A high-performance distributed hash table for peer-to-peer information retrieval,Fabius Klemm,This thesis describes our research results in the context of peer-to-peer information retrieval(P2P-IR). One goal in P2P-IR is to build a search engine for the World Wide Web (WWW)that runs on up to hundreds of thousands or even millions computers distributed all over theworld. The idea is not only to distribute the content; eg; web pages; but also an index forsearching this content. The main focus of this thesis lies on designing an overlay networkthat is capable of transporting data between the different parts of such a distributed searchengine. We built a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) that is able to sustain and efficiently handlehigh traffic loads; which are typically generated by a distributed IR application. We firstanalyze the behavior of a state-of-the-art DHT under heavy load and show that a DHT cansuffer a so-called" congestion collapse" if it does not have a congestion control …,*,2008,*
Bandwidth-efficient delay-and loss-tolerant overlay routing,Wojciech Galuba; Karl Aberer; Zoran Despotovic; Wolfgang Kellerer,Motivation. Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems are mostly deployed in heterogeneousenvironments with resource availability varying not only across the nodes but also over time.If any of the shared computational; storage or network resources are exhausted; failures anddelays occur. The commonly used crash-stop failure model assumes that once a node stopssending messages it never again resumes. Such failures are trivially detected andappropriate algorithms are run that maintain the connectivity and routing efficiency of theP2P overlay under continuous arrivals and departures of the peers (ie churn)[6];[4]. Thefailure detection mechanisms in the crashstop model are typically tuned to minimize thenumber of false positives that might be caused by intermittent message dropping or delays.Avoiding these false positives is important as oversensitive failure detection triggers more …,Proceedings of the IEEE 16th International Conference on Network Protocols,2008,*

Fast Probabilistic Subsumption Checking for Publish/Subscribe Systems,Aris M Ouksel; Oana Jurca; Ivana Podnar; Karl Aberer,Abstract. Efficient subsumption checking; deciding whether a subscription or publication issubsumed by a set of previously defined subscriptions; is of paramount importance forpublish/subscribe systems. It provides the core system functionality—matching ofpublications to subscriber needs expressed as subscriptions—and additionally; reduces theoverall system load and generated traffic since the covered subscriptions are notpropagated in distributed environments. As the subsumption problem was shown previouslyto be co-NP complete and existing solutions typically apply pairwise comparisons to detectthe subsumption relationship; we propose a 'Monte Carlo type'probabilistic algorithm for thegeneral subsumption problem.

Until recently; most data integration techniques revolved around centralapproaches; eg; global schemas; to enable transparent access to heterogeneousdatabases. However; with the advent of the Internet and the democratization of toolsfacilitating knowledge elicitation in machine-processable formats; the situation is quicklyevolving. One cannot rely on global; centralized schemas anymore as knowledge creationand consumption are getting increasingly dynamic and decentralized.

IP description; goals,Anwitaman Datta; Oana Jurca; Manfred Hauswirth; Karl Aberer,Results: We have devised an event dissemination algorithm suitable for implementing thetopicbased publish/subscribe abstraction in mobile ad-hoc networks [BaehniCG: 04]. Thereliability of the dissemination relies both on the mobility of the publishers/subscribers aswell as on as the validity period of the events. Our algorithm minimizes the use of thememory of the subscribers by exploiting the validity periods of the events and does not relyon any routing algorithms. As such; our algorithm is suitable to highly mobile environments.We performed exhaustive simulations that highlight interesting relations between the validityperiods of the events and the speed of the publishers/subscribers. Together with thesimulations; a current prototype implementation has been developed.,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,2004,*

Towards a Foundation Model for Peer-to-Peer Web Information,Jie Wu; Karl Aberer,We find that there lacks a formal algebraic framework in the research area of P2Pinformation retrieval. Such a formal framework is indispensable and pivotal. On the onehand; no solid theoretical foundation can explain why the results of many ad-hoccommercial ranking algorithms are good or bad; on the other hand; in some cases; it mightbe preferable in a decentralized search system to use different retrieval models and differentranking algorithms at the same time since each separate document collection and each peermight have different characteristics. Thus it is important to have a common framework; wherewe can capture the individual models and describe the overall behavior. Such a frameworkcharacterizes notions like ranking; relevance feedback; rank aggregation and combination;etc. and necessary operations. In this paper; we define such a foundation model for P2P …,*,2004,*

Efficient; self-contained handling of identity in Peer-to-Peer systems,Manfred Hauswirth; Anwitaman Datta; Karl Aberer,Abstract Identification is an essential building block for many services in distributedinformation systems. The quality and purpose of identification may differ but the basicunderlying problem is always to bind a set of attributes to an identifier in a unique anddeterministic way. Name/directory services such as DNS; X. 500; or UDDI are a well-established concept to address this problem in distributed information systems. However;none of these services addresses the specific requirements of peer-to-peer systems withrespect to dynamism; decentralization and maintenance. We propose the implementation ofdirectories using a structured peer-to-peer overlay network and apply this approach tosupport self-contained maintenance of routing tables with dynamic IP addresses instructured P2P systems.

Estimating Human Interactions with Electrical Appliances for Activity-based Energy Savings Recommendations,Tri Kurniawan Wijaya; Karl Aberer,Abstract Since the power consumption of different electrical appliances in a household canbe recorded by individual smart meters; it becomes possible to start considering in moredetails the interactions of the residents with those devices throughout the day. Appliancesusages should not be considered as independent events; but rather as enablers foractivities. In this work; we propose an automated method for determining when an electricaldevice is triggered solely from its power trace. Knowing when an appliance is powered on isrequired for identifying recurrent patterns that could later be understood as activities.Leveraging activity knowledge over time will allow us to design personalized energy efficientmeasures. We envision the design of future ambient intelligence systems; where the smarthome can optimize the energy consumption in regards to the lifestyles of its residents.,Power [W],2000,*

A Heuristics-Based Approach to Query Optimization,Dunren Che; Karl Aberer,Abstract The number of documents published via WWW in form of SGML/HTML has beenrapidly growing for years. Efficient; declarative access mechanisms for this type ofdocuments–structured documents in general–are becoming of great importance. This paperreports our most recent advance in pursuit of effective processing and optimization ofstructured-document queries; which are important for large repositories of structureddocuments. Our methodology emphasizes applying exclusively deterministictransformations on query expressions to achieve the best possible optimization efficiency. Anew approach is thus proposed that facilitates the exploitation of the DTD-knowledge;structural properties; and structure indices of structured documents for the purpose of fastquery optimization.,1999 International Database Engineering and Applications Symposium (IDEAS),1999,*
The Design of Query Interfaces to GPCRDB,Dunren Che; Karl Aberer; Yangjun Chen,Abstract In this paper; we describe the query interfaces of a practical biological databasesystem-GPCRDB. Distinguishing features of the system include: an embedded smart queryengine (for query relaxation); smooth integration of navigation with the more conventionalSQL-based query mechanisms; and the top-down style of incremental query resultpresentation combined with flexible navigation capabilities. Query relaxation is importantdue to the fact that queries tend not to be expressed exactly by the users; particularly whencomplex domain knowledge is involved. Navigation capability is desired because it can bean ideal supplement to SQL-based query mechanisms when large; complex data sets areconcerned; especially in the WWW environment where hyperlinks are heavily used.

Efficient algorithm for determining the optimal execution strategy for path queries in OODBS,Weimin Chen; Karl Aberer,Abstract. To select an optimal query evaluation strategy for a path query in an object-oriented database system one has to exploit the available index structures on the path. In adatabase with a large database schema many alternative strategies have to be consideredfor the evaluation of a path query by choosing from a large set of available indices; whichcan make the selection of the optimal strategy expensive. We give an algorithm that finds theoptimal strategy for evaluating a path query with time complexity independent of the set ofindices available in the database. The algorithm considers all possible forward andbackward traversal strategies and has time complexity O (n2) in the path length n.Incorporating this algorithm into the query optimization for object-oriented databasemanagement systems can improve the response time of the system; by optimizing an …,Sistemi Evoluti per Basi di Dati (SEBD" 96),1996,*

Search and Retrieval in Object-Oriented Information Systems,Erich Neuhold; Karl Aberer; Wolfgang Klas; Adelheit Stein; Ulrich Thiel,Abstract Retrieving data that satisfies a complex information need is often an exploratoryand incremental process. In addition; the handling of multimedia information places anadditional cognitive workload on the human user. A guiding principle of system design isthat the system should adapt to the needs of the human user; and not vice versa [cf. Norman& Draper 1986]. This means that the user with his strong and even more with his weak pointshas to be the central parameter in the interface design process. An ideal system would beone which presented the user a familiar environment; which minimizes the learning of theformal details of the system in order to work effectively with it.,*,1993,*

Theserequirements include eg; dynamic data management; non-transparent parallelism;scheduling; several kinds of abstractions; resource distribution transparency; and advancedinteraction models satisfying real time constraints. We show how some of the requirementscan be met by exploiting concepts from the object-oriented paradigm and database systems.Then we discuss extensions needed with respect to data integration; scheduling …,*,1993,*

Onthe other hand; the classes of algorithms using only arithmetic operations are the moststudied in complexity theory; and are used; eg; to obtain fast parallel algorithms fornumerical problems. In this paper; we study; by using a simulation argument; the relativepower of di erent sets of operations for computing with approximations. We prove thatcomparisions can be simulated e ciently and with the same error bounds for most inputs byarithmetic operations when divisions are present. To develop our simulation strategy wecombine notions imported from approximation theory and topology with complexity and errorbounds.,Proceedings of the Thirtieth Annual Allerton Conference on Communication; Control and Computing,1992,*

Pay-as-you-go Reconciliation in Schema Matching Networks,Nguyen Quoc; Viet Hung; Nguyen Thanh Tam; Karl Aberer; Avigdor Gal; Matthias Weidlich,Abstract—Schema matching is the process of establishing correspondences between theattributes of database schemas for data integration purposes. Although several automaticschema matching tools have been developed; their results are often incom-plete orerroneous. To obtain a correct set of correspondences; a human expert is usually required tovalidate the generated correspondences. We analyze this reconciliation process in a settingwhere a number of schemas needs to be matched; in the presence of consistencyexpectations about the network of attribute correspondences. We develop a probabilisticmodel that helps to identify the most uncertain correspondences; thus allowing us to guidethe expert's work and collect his input about the most problematic cases. As the availabilityof such experts is often limited; we develop techniques that can construct a set of good …,*,*,*

Argument Discovery via Crowdsourcing,Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung; Duong Chi Thang; Nguyen Thanh Tam; Matthias Weidlich; Karl Aberer; Hongzhi Yin; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract The amount of controversial issues being discussed on the Web has been growingdramatically. In articles; blogs; and wikis; people express their points of view in the form ofarguments; ie; claims that are supported by evidence. Discovery of arguments has a largepotential for informing decision-making. However; argument discovery is hindered by thesheer amount of available Web data and its unstructured; free-text representation. Theformer calls for automatic text-mining approaches; whereas the latter implies a need formanual processing to extract the structure of arguments. In this paper; we propose acrowdsourcing-based approach to build a corpus of arguments; an argumentation base;thereby mediating the trade-off of automatic text-mining and manual processing in argumentdiscovery. We develop an end-to-end process that minimizes the crowd cost while …,*,*,*

ID: 160,Yangjun Chen; Duren Che; Karl Aberer,Abstract In this paper; a new technique is developed to support the query relaxation inbiological databases. Query relaxation is required due to the fact that queries tend not to beexpressed exactly by the users; especially in scientific databas s such as biologicaldatabases; in which complex domain knowledge is heavily involved. To treat this problem;we propose the concept of the so-called fuzzy equivalence classes to capture importantkinds of domain knowledge that is used to relax queries. This concept is further integratedwith the canonical techniques for pattern searching such as the position tree and automatontheory. As a result; fuzzy queries produced through relaxation can be efficiently evaluated.This method has been successfully utilized in a practical biological database-the GPCRDB.,*,*,*
Where are the RDF Streams?,Andrea Mauri; Jean-Paul Calbimonte; Daniele Dell’Aglio; Marco Balduini; Emanuele Della Valle; Karl Aberer,Abstract. RDF Stream Processing (RSP) bridges the gap between semantic technologiesand data stream systems. Although a number of RSP systems have been recently proposed;no RDF streams are actually made publicly available on the Web. To cope with this; RSPengines require ad-hoc wrappers in order to be fed from non-RDF streams available on theInternet. In this paper we present TripleWave: an approach for publishing existing streamson the Web as RDF streams; using mappings to perform live transformation of data; andfollowing the Linked Data principles. We implemented and deployed TripleWave for aconcrete use-case: a live feed of updates of Wikipedia.,*,*,*

Online Unsupervised State Recognition in Sensor Data (Supplementary Materials),Julien Eberle; Tri Kurniawan Wijaya; Karl Aberer,Abstract—Smart sensors; such as smart meters or smart phones; are nowadays ubiquitous.To be “smart”; however; they need to process their input data with limited storage andcomputational resources. In this paper; we convert the stream of sensor data into a stream ofsymbols; and further; to higher level symbols in such a way that common analytical taskssuch as anomaly detection; forecasting or state recognition; can still be carried out on thetransformed data with almost no loss of accuracy; and using far fewer resources. We identifystates of a monitored system and convert them into symbols (thus; reducing data size); whilekeeping “interesting” events; such as anomalies or transition between states; as it is. Ouralgorithm is able to find states of various length in an online and unsupervised way; which iscrucial since behavior of the system is not known beforehand. We show the effectiveness …,*,*,*
Efficient Distributed Decision Trees for Robust Regression [Technical Report],Tian Guo; Konstantin Kutzkov; Mohamed Ahmed; Jean-Paul Calbimonte; Karl Aberer,Abstract. The availability of massive volumes of data and recent advances in data collectionand processing platforms have motivated the development of distributed machine learningalgorithms. In numerous real-world applications large datasets are inevitably noisy andcontain outliers. These outliers can dramatically degrade the performance of standardmachine learning approaches such as regression trees. To this end; we present a noveldistributed regression tree approach that utilizes robust regression statistics; statistics thatare more robust to outliers; for handling large and noisy data. We propose to integrate robuststatistics based error criteria into the regression tree. A data summarization method isdeveloped and used to improve the efficiency of learning regression trees in the distributedsetting. We implemented the proposed approach and baselines based on Apache Spark …,*,*,*
Advanced XML Processing,Karl Aberer,XML has established itself over the recent years as THE standard for representing data inscientific and business applications. Starting out as a standard data exchange format for theWeb; it has become instrumental in the development of electronic commerce applicationsand online information services; and draws in its tailwind a multitude of standardizationefforts for all kinds of applications. Documents are not only used for representing multimediainformation content but also for many other purposes; like the representation of meta-information and the specification of component interfaces; protocols; and processes. As aconsequence; the amount of XML data being stored and processed is large and will beincreasing at an astonishing rate. This has caused XML data management to become afocus of research efforts in the database community. This was the motivation for putting …,*,*,*
Uncertainty Reasoning for the Semantic Web,Fernando Bobillo; Paulo Costa; Claudia d'Amato; Nicola Fanizzi; Francis Fung; Thomas Lukasiewicz; Trevor Martin; Matthias Nickles; Yun Peng; Michael Pool; Pavel Smrz; Peter Vojtas,Abstract. Partial knowledge about geospatial categories is critical for knowledge modellingin the geospatial domain but is beyond the scope of conventional ontologies. Degree ofoverlaps between geospatial categories; especially those based on geospatial actionsconcepts and geospatial enitity concepts need to be specified in ontologies. We present anapproach to encode probabilistic information in geospatial ontologies based on theBayesOWL approach. This paper presents a case study of using road network ontologies.Inferences within the probabilistic ontologies are discussed along with inferences acrossontologies using common concepts of geospatial actions within each ontology. The resultsof machine-based mappings produced are verified with human generated mappings ofconcepts.,*,*,*
SMART: A tool for analyzing and reconciling schema matching networks,Zoltán Miklós; Karl Aberer; Matthias Weidlich' Avigdor Gal,Abstract—Schema matching supports data integration by establishing correspondencesbetween the attributes of independently designed database schemas. In recent years;various tools for automatic pair-wise matching of schemas have been developed. Since thematching process is inherently uncertain; the correspondences generated by such tools areoften validated by a human expert. In this work; we consider scenarios in which attributecorrespondences are identiﬁed in a network of schemas and not only in a pairwise setting.Here; correspondences between different schemas are interrelated; so that incomplete anderroneous matching results propagate in the network and the validation of acorrespondence by an expert has ripple effects. To analyse and reconcile such matchings inschema networks; we present the Schema Matching Analyzer and Reconciliation Tool …,*,*,*

Although several automaticschema matching tools have been developed; their results are often incomplete orerroneous. To obtain a correct set of correspondences; usually human effort is required tovalidate the generated correspondences.

Second; a list of challengesis presented whose solution is deemed to enhance our understanding (theory) and to makeprogress in addressing current network problems (practice).,Month,*,*
Agents and Peer-to-Peer Computing,Gianluca Moro Sonia Bergamaschi; Karl Aberer,Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing is attracting enormous media attention; spurred by thepopularity of file sharing systems such as Napster; Gnutella; and Morpheus. The peers areautonomous; or as some call them; first-class citizens. P2P networks are emerging as a newdistributed computing paradigm for their potential to harness the computing power of thehosts composing the network and make their underutilized resources available to others.This possibility has generated a lot of interest in many industrial organizations that havealready launched important projects. In P2P systems; peer and Web services in the role ofresources become shared and combined to enable new capabilities greater than the sum ofthe parts. This means that services can be developed and treated as pools of methods thatcan be composed dynamically. The decentralized nature of P2P computing makes it also …,*,*,*
A Generalized Cover problem for Schema Matching,Karl Aberer; Ran Bittmann; Avigdor Gal; Michael Katz; Eliezer Levy; Zoltán Miklós; Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung; Tomer Sagi; Victor Shafran,Given a schema and a set of concepts; representative of entities in the domain of discourse(eg; a vendor in an eCommerce application); schema cover defines correspondencesbetween concepts and parts of the schema. Schema cover aims at “explaining” the schemain terms of concepts and thus; enhance the integration of a schema into an existing body ofknowledge. Schema cover can be considered a service in a dataspace toolbox [7]; enablinga pay-as-you-go approach for the introduction of a new schema. More motivation can beinserted here Schema cover builds upon the research work in schema matching; the task ofproviding correspondences between heterogeneous schema elements (eg attributes indatabase schemata). Schema matching is one of the basic operations required by theprocess of data and schema integration [1];[14];[3]; and thus has great effect on its …,*,*,*

Structured Overlay For Heterogeneous Environments: Design and Evaluation of Oscar,UNAS ˇSAR; ANWITAMAN DATTA; KARL ABERER,Recent years have seen advances in building large Internet-scale index structures;generally known as structured overlays. Early structured overlays realized distributed hashtables (DHTs) which are ill suited for anything but exact queries. The need to support rangequeries necessitates systems that can handle uneven load distributions. However suchsystems suffer from practical problems—including poor latency; disproportionate bandwidthusage at participating peers; or unrealistic assumptions on peers' homogeneity; in terms ofavailable storage or bandwidth resources. In this article we consider a system that is not onlyable to support uneven load distributions but also to operate in heterogeneousenvironments; where each peer can autonomously decide how much of its resources tocontribute to the system. We provide the theoretical foundations of realizing such a …,*,*,*
2009 IEEE International Conference on Web Services Towards Probabilistic Estimation of Quality of Online Services,Le-hung Vu; Karl Aberer,Abstract Accurate estimation of quality of online services is both an important and difficultproblem; since a service has many interdependent quality attributes influenced by severalcontextual factors. It is even more challenging as quality ratings come from sources withunknown reliability; each source may rate a service on different quality aspects. Althoughseveral solutions have been proposed; there is little work addressing all these issuesthoroughly. In this paper; we show that domain knowledge on service structure and relatedconstraints; such as causal dependencies among quality attributes and contextual factors;while widely available; can be exploited to effectively address the above issues in atheoretically-sound framework. Theoretical analysis shows that computational cost of theapproach is acceptable; and accurate evaluation of service quality requires a reasonable …,*,*,*
Survey on Internet Science Research,Anna Satsiou; Karl Aberer,1. Executive Summary This deliverable seeks to provide an Internet Science Survey. Since“Internet Science” is still more of an ultimate goal of this NoE than “a reality”; this survey aimsat presenting the different and usually unsynchronized efforts to study and understandInternet from different perspectives and disciplines. In this way it will serve as an importantstarting point to on one hand provide a cohesive view of the Internet research and on theother hand motivate and enable research towards making Internet a unifying discipline thatalthough borrows some of its principles from other well-established sciences; has also itsown particular fundamental laws and principles; similar to any other empirical science.Towards these goals; this deliverable presents the major Internet research drives that havebeen pursued so far; while next version; ie; D13. 2 related to the Roadmap of Internet …,*,*,*
Online Multi-Model Approximation of Time Series,Thanasis G Papaioannou; Mehdi Riahi; Karl Aberer,Abstract—Real-time model-based data approximation and filtering is a common solution forreducing the storage (and communication) overhead. However; the selection of the mostefficient model depends on the potentially dynamic characteristics of the data stream;namely rate; burstiness; deviation; etc. Here; we investigate the innovative concept ofefficiently combining multiple approximation models in real-time for maximizing achievabledata compression.,Wireless Integration of Sensor networks in Hybrid architectures,*,*

Each peer has a path; a binary stringthat gives the position of a peer in the tree (paths are shown in gray in Figure 1). Peers canhave the same path and become replicas of each other.,*,*,*
Demo Abstract: GSN; Quick and Simple Sensor Network Deployment,Ali Salehi; Karl Aberer,Abstract—Wireless sensor and actuator networks are an emerging computer class based ona new platform; networking structure; and interface that enable novel; low cost and highvolume applications. One of the main obstacles in adaption of the sensor networks is thelack of standardization and the continuous inflow of novel sensor network technologieswhich have made the sensor network deployment the main factor of manpowerconsumption. To address these problems we developed the Global Sensor Networks (GSN)middleware with the aims of rapid and simple deployment of a wide range of sensor networktechnologies; providing flexible integration and discovery of sensor networks; enablingaddition of new platforms quickly; and dynamically adaption of the system configurationduring operation. In this paper we provide a brief overview of GSN with the focus on …,*,*,*
Message from the Advanced Seminar Chairs,Karl Aberer; Jari Veijalainen,The organization committee of MDM 2011 decided to offer advanced seminars instead oftutorials this year. We discussed during autumn 2010 what kind of seminars we would like tohave. The result was that we could have very visionary seminars that try to look far into thefuture; on one hand; or a few years ahead; on the other hand. In our very rapidly developingfield forecasting the next 10-15 years turned out to be a tough challenge. Thus we receivedproposals on ubiquitous technologies that are currently emerging in research labs in variousparts of the world and that would be in production in a few years.,*,*,*

Panel:“Networking Meets Databases: Do we meet or merge?”,K Aberer; A Abbadi; R Jain UCI; D Gunopulos UCR; W Hong,The recent years brought a massive change in the way data management is viewed. Data isbeing increasingly processed within networks. P2P computing and sensor networks are themost prominent examples. The classical separation of information systems fromcommunication systems is disolving. We can observe that very similar problems areaddressed by what before seemed fairly disparate research communities. For example; theproblem of aggregating and filtering data within networks is being studied simultanously ininformation theory and networking; both classical EE fields; as well as in distributed systemsand databases; both classical CS fields. Even researchers from so seemingly unrelateddisciplines such as physics start to investigate these problems. This raises a number ofissues of how research in this field is organized now and ought to be organized in the …,*,*,*
Peer-To-Peer Double Auctioning,Zoran Despotovic; Jean-Claude Usunier; Karl Aberer,Abstract P2P systems constitute nowadays an increasingly important part of the online worldthat needs or will soon need all kinds of e-commerce services and applications that arenormally available today on client-server platforms. When designing new solutions particularattention must be paid to conquering autonomy of the peers and the lack of any centralauthorities as two most important problems. In this paper we explore possibilities to bring e-commerce into P2P and propose a double auctioning mechanism that does not rely on theexistence of central authorities; auctioneer in particular; and is amenable to implementationin P2P environments. The mechanism has good economic properties such as; for example;fast convergence towards efficient trading through intuitive and simple bidding strategies.,*,*,*
PicShark: Emergent Semantics Processes to Recontextualize Semi-Structured Metadata in Large Scale Media Sharing Environments,Philippe Cudré-Mauroux; Karl Aberer; Adriana Budura; Manfred Hauswirth,ABSTRACT With the ubiquitous availability of communication devices; personal informationand media sharing is becoming a key functionality of the pervasive Web. In this context;publishing and searching for media content heavily relies on the availability of meaningfulmetadata. Metadata scarcity and heterogeneity are among the major obstacles hamperingmeaningful media sharing in large communities. However; participating in a communityopens new perspectives for addressing metadata scarcity and heterogeneity throughsharing of semantic knowledge and metadata. Taking advantage of this opportunity; weprovide a solution to those two problems through a bottom-up; community-based andselforganizing recontextualization process in which information entropy–in terms of missingand heterogeneous metadata–is gradually alleviated.

On de Bruijn routing in distributed hash tables: There and back again EPFL Technical Report: IC/2004/41,Anwitaman Datta; Sarunas Girdzijauskas; Karl Aberer,Abstract We show in this paper that de Bruijn networks; despite providing efficient searchwhile using constant routing table size; as well as simplicity of the understanding andimplementation of such networks; are unsuitable where key distribution will be uneven; arealistic scenario for most practical applications. In presence of arbitrarily skewed datadistribution; it has only recently been shown that some traditional P2P overlay networks withnon-constant (typically logarithmic) in stead of constant routing table size can meetconflicting objectives of storage load balancing as well as search efficiency. So this paper;while showing that de Bruijn networks fail to meet these dual objectives; opens up a moregeneral problem for the research community as to whether P2P systems with constantrouting table can at all achieve the conflicting objectives of retaining search efficiency as …,*,*,*
