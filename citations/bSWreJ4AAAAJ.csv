Query and update efficient B+-tree based indexing of moving objects,Christian S Jensen; Dan Lin; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract A number of emerging applications of data management technology involve themonitoring and querying of large quantities of continuous variables; eg; the positions ofmobile service users; termed moving objects. In such applications; large quantities of statesamples obtained via sensors are streamed to a database. Indexes for moving objects mustsupport queries efficiently; but must also support frequent updates. Indexes based onminimum bounding regions (MBRs) such as the R-tree exhibit high concurrency overheadsduring node splitting; and each individual update is known to be quite costly. This motivatesthe design of a solution that enables the B+-tree to manage moving objects. We representmoving-object locations as vectors that are timestamped based on their update time. Byapplying a novel linearization technique to these values; it is possible to index the …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,405
Ensuring distributed accountability for data sharing in the cloud,Smitha Sundareswaran; Anna Squicciarini; Dan Lin,Cloud computing enables highly scalable services to be easily consumed over the Interneton an as-needed basis. A major feature of the cloud services is that users' data are usuallyprocessed remotely in unknown machines that users do not own or operate. While enjoyingthe convenience brought by this new emerging technology; users' fears of losing control oftheir own data (particularly; financial and health data) can become a significant barrier to thewide adoption of cloud services. To address this problem; in this paper; we propose a novelhighly decentralized information accountability framework to keep track of the actual usageof the users' data in the cloud. In particular; we propose an object-centered approach thatenables enclosing our logging mechanism together with users' data and policies.

Continuous clustering of moving objects,Christian S Jensen; Dan Lin; Beng Chin Ooi,This paper considers the problem of efficiently maintaining a clustering of a dynamic set ofdata points that move continuously in two-dimensional Euclidean space. This problem hasreceived little attention and introduces new challenges to clustering. The paper proposes anew scheme that is capable of incrementally clustering moving objects. This proposalemploys a notion of object dissimilarity that considers object movement across a period oftime; and it employs clustering features that can be maintained efficiently in incrementalfashion. In the proposed scheme; a quality measure for incremental clusters is used foridentifying clusters that are not compact enough after certain insertions and deletions. Anextensive experimental study shows that the new scheme performs significantly faster thantraditional ones that frequently rebuild clusters. The study also shows that the new …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2007,134
An approach to evaluate data trustworthiness based on data provenance,Chenyun Dai; Dan Lin; Elisa Bertino; Murat Kantarcioglu,Abstract Today; with the advances of information technology; individual people andorganizations can obtain and process data from different sources. It is critical to ensure dataintegrity so that effective decisions can be made based on these data. An importantcomponent of any solution for assessing data integrity is represented by techniques andtools to evaluate the trustworthiness of data provenance. However; few efforts have beendevoted to investigate approaches for assessing how trusted the data are; based in turn onan assessment of the data sources and intermediaries. To bridge this gap; we propose adata provenance trust model which takes into account various factors that may affect thetrustworthiness and; based on these factors; assigns trust scores to both data and dataproviders. Such trust scores represent key information based on which data users may …,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2008,124
Effective density queries on continuouslymoving objects,Christian S Jensen; Dan Lin; Beng Chin Ooi; Rui Zhang,This paper assumes a setting where a population of objects move continuously in theEuclidean plane. The position of each object; modeled as a linear function from time topoints; is assumed known. In this setting; the paper studies the querying for dense regions.In particular; the paper defines a particular type of density query with desirable propertiesand then proceeds to propose an algorithm for the efficient computation of density queries.While the algorithm may exploit any existing index for the current and near-future positionsof moving objects; the Bx-tree is used. The paper reports on an extensive empirical study;which elicits the performance properties of the algorithm.,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06.

A brokerage-based approach for cloud service selection,Smitha Sundareswaran; Anna Squicciarini; Dan Lin,The expanding Cloud computing services offer great opportunities for consumers to find thebest service and best pricing; which however raises new challenges on how to select thebest service out of the huge pool. It is time-consuming for consumers to collect the necessaryinformation and analyze all service providers to make the decision. This is also a highlydemanding task from a computational perspective; because the same computations may beconducted repeatedly by multiple consumers who have similar requirements. Therefore; inthis paper; we propose a novel brokerage-based architecture in the Cloud; where the Cloudbrokers is responsible for the service selection. In particular; we design a unique indexingtechnique for managing the information of a large number of Cloud service providers. Wethen develop efficient service selection algorithms that rank potential service providers …,Cloud Computing (CLOUD); 2012 IEEE 5th International Conference on,2012,109
A survey of quantification of privacy preserving data mining algorithms,Elisa Bertino; Dan Lin; Wei Jiang,The aim of privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) algorithms is to extract relevantknowledge from large amounts of data while protecting at the same time sensitiveinformation. An important aspect in the design of such algorithms is the identification ofsuitable evaluation criteria and the development of related benchmarks. Recent research inthe area has devoted much effort to determine a trade-off between the right to privacy andthe need of knowledge discovery. It is often the case that no privacy preserving algorithmexists that outperforms all the others on all possible criteria. Therefore; it is crucial to providea comprehensive view on a set of metrics related to existing privacy preserving algorithmsso that we can gain insights on how to design more effective measurement and PPDMalgorithms.

Access control policy combining: theory meets practice,Ninghui Li; Qihua Wang; Wahbeh Qardaji; Elisa Bertino; Prathima Rao; Jorge Lobo; Dan Lin,Abstract Many access control policy languages; eg; XACML; allow a policy to containmultiple sub-policies; and the result of the policy on a request is determined by combiningthe results of the sub-policies according to some policy combining algorithms (PCAs).Existing access control policy languages; however; do not provide a formal language forspecifying PCAs. As a result; it is difficult to extend them with new PCAs. While severalformal policy combining algebras have been proposed; they did not address importantpractical issues such as policy evaluation errors and obligations; furthermore; they cannotexpress PCAs that consider all sub-policies as a whole (eg; weak majority or strongmajority). We propose a policy combining language PCL; which can succinctly and preciselyexpress a variety of PCAs. PCL represents an advancement both in terms of theory and …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2009,104
An algebra for fine-grained integration of XACML policies,Prathima Rao; Dan Lin; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li; Jorge Lobo,Abstract Collaborative and distributed applications; such as dynamic coalitions andvirtualized grid computing; often require integrating access control policies of collaboratingparties. Such an integration must be able to support complex authorization specificationsand the fine-grained integration requirements that the various parties may have. In thispaper; we introduce an algebra for fine-grained integration of sophisticated policies. Thealgebra; which consists of three binary and two unary operations; is able to support thespecification of a large variety of integration constraints. To assess the expressive power ofour algebra; we introduce a notion of completeness and prove that our algebra is completewith respect to this notion. We then propose a framework that uses the algebra for the fine-grained integration of policies expressed in XACML.

Efficient indexing of the historical; present; and future positions of moving objects,Dan Lin; Christian S Jensen; Beng Chin Ooi; Simonas Šaltenis,Abstract Although significant effort has been put into the development of efficient spatio-temporal indexing techniques for moving objects; little attention has been given to thedevelopment of techniques that efficiently support queries about the past; present; and futurepositions of objects. The provisioning of such techniques is challenging; both because of thenature of the data; which reflects continuous movement; and because of the types of queriesto be supported. This paper proposes the BB x-index structure; which indexes the positionsof moving objects; given as linear functions of time; at any time. The index stores linearizedmoving-object locations in a forest of B+-trees. The index supports queries that selectobjects based on temporal and spatial constraints; such as queries that retrieve all objectswhose positions fall within a spatial range during a set of time intervals.

Preventing information leakage from indexing in the cloud,Anna Squicciarini; Smitha Sundareswaran; Dan Lin,Cloud computing enables highly scalable services to be easily consumed over the Interneton an as-needed basis. While cloud computing is expanding rapidly and used by manyindividuals and organizations internationally; data protection issues in the cloud have notbeen carefully addressed at current stage. Users' fear of confidential data (particularlyfinancial and health data) leakage and loss of privacy in the cloud may become a significantbarrier to the wide adoption of cloud services. In this paper; we explore a newly emergingproblem of information leakage caused by indexing in the cloud.

A benchmark for evaluating moving object indexes,Su Chen; Christian S Jensen; Dan Lin,Abstract Progress in science and engineering relies on the ability to measure; reliably and indetail; pertinent properties of artifacts under design. Progress in the area of database-indexdesign thus relies on empirical studies based on prototype implementations of indexes. Thispaper proposes a benchmark that targets techniques for the indexing of the current and near-future positions of moving objects. This benchmark enables the comparison of existing andfuture indexing techniques. It covers important aspects of such indexes that have notpreviously been covered by any benchmark. Notable aspects covered include updateefficiency; query efficiency; concurrency control; and storage requirements. Next; the paperapplies the benchmark to half a dozen notable moving-object indexes; thus demonstratingthe viability of the benchmark and offering new insight into the performance properties of …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,84
An approach to evaluate policy similarity,Dan Lin; Prathima Rao; Elisa Bertino; Jorge Lobo,Abstract Recent collaborative applications and enterprises very often need to efficientlyintegrate their access control policies. An important step in policy integration is to analyzethe similarity of policies. Existing approaches to policy similarity analysis are mainly basedon logical reasoning and boolean function comparison. Such approaches arecomputationally expensive and do not scale well for large heterogeneous distributedenvironments (like Grid computing systems). In this paper; we propose a policy similaritymeasure as a filter phase for policy similarity analysis. This measure provides a lightweightapproach to pre-compile a large amount of policies and only return the most similar policiesfor further evaluation. In the paper we formally define the measure; by taking into accountboth the case of categorical attributes and numeric attributes.

A3p: adaptive policy prediction for shared images over popular content sharing sites,Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Smitha Sundareswaran; Dan Lin; Josh Wede,Abstract More and more people go online today and share their personal images usingpopular web services like Picasa. While enjoying the convenience brought by advancedtechnology; people also become aware of the privacy issues of data being shared. Recentstudies have highlighted that people expect more tools to allow them to regain control overtheir privacy. In this work; we propose an Adaptive Privacy Policy Prediction (A3P) system tohelp users compose privacy settings for their images. In particular; we examine the role ofimage content and metadata as possible indicators of users' privacy preferences.

Conditional privacy-aware role based access control,Qun Ni; Dan Lin; Elisa Bertino; Jorge Lobo,Abstract Privacy is considered critical for all organizations needing to manage individualrelated information. As such; there is an increasing need for access control models whichcan adequately support the specification and enforcement of privacy policies. In this paper;we propose a model; referred to as Conditional Privacy-aware Role Based Access Control(P-RBAC); which supports expressive condition languages and flexible relations amongpermission assignments for more complex privacy policies. Efficient algorithms for detectingconflicts; redundancies; and indeterminism for a set of permission assignments arepresented. In the paper we also extend Conditional P-RBAC to Universal P-RBAC by takinginto account hierarchical relations among roles; data and purposes. In comparison withother approaches; such as P3P; EPAL; and XACML; our work has achieved both …,European Symposium on Research in Computer Security,2007,66
EXAM: a comprehensive environment for the analysis of access control policies,Dan Lin; Prathima Rao; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li; Jorge Lobo,Abstract Policy integration and inter-operation is often a crucial requirement when partieswith different access control policies need to participate in collaborative applications andcoalitions. Such requirement is even more difficult to address for dynamic large-scalecollaborations; in which the number of access control policies to analyze and compare canbe quite large. An important step in policy integration and inter-operation is to analyze thesimilarity of policies. Policy similarity can sometimes also be a pre-condition for establishinga collaboration; in that a party may enter a collaboration with another party only if thepolicies enforced by the other party match or are very close to its own policies. Existingapproaches to the problem of analyzing and comparing access control policies are verylimited; in that they only deal with some special cases.

Specifically; thispaper consists of the following contributions: 1) massive social images and their privacysettings are leveraged to learn the object-privacy relatedness effectively and identify a set ofprivacy-sensitive object classes automatically; 2) a deep multi-task learning algorithm isdeveloped to jointly learn more representative deep convolutional neural networks andmore discriminative tree classifier; so that we can achieve fast and accurate detection oflarge numbers of privacy-sensitive object classes; 3) automatic recommendation of privacysettings for image sharing can be achieved by detecting the underlying privacy-sensitive …,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2017,54
Data protection models for service provisioning in the cloud,Dan Lin; Anna Squicciarini,Abstract Cloud computing enables highly scalable services to be easily consumed over theInternet on an as-needed basis. While cloud computing is expanding rapidly and used bymany individuals and organizations internationally; data protection issues in the cloud havenot been carefully addressed at current stage.

Privacy policy inference of user-uploaded images on content sharing sites,Anna Cinzia Squicciarini; Dan Lin; Smitha Sundareswaran; Joshua Wede,With the increasing volume of images users share through social sites; maintaining privacyhas become a major problem; as demonstrated by a recent wave of publicized incidentswhere users inadvertently shared personal information. In light of these incidents; the needof tools to help users control access to their shared content is apparent. Toward addressingthis need; we propose an Adaptive Privacy Policy Prediction (A3P) system to help userscompose privacy settings for their images. We examine the role of social context; imagecontent; and metadata as possible indicators of users' privacy preferences. We propose atwo-level framework which according to the user's available history on the site; determinesthe best available privacy policy for the user's images being uploaded.

Policy decomposition for collaborative access control,Dan Lin; Prathima Rao; Elisa Bertino; Ninghui Li; Jorge Lobo,Abstract With the advances in web service techniques; new collaborative applications haveemerged like supply chain arrangements and coalition in government agencies. In suchapplications; the collaborating parties are responsible for managing and protectingresources entrusted to them. Access control decisions thus become a collaborative activity inwhich a global policy must be enforced by a set of collaborating parties withoutcompromising the autonomy or confidentiality requirements of these parties. Unfortunately;none of the conventional access control systems meets these new requirements. To supportcollaborative access control; in this paper; we propose a novel policy-based access controlmodel. Our main idea is based on the notion of policy decomposition and we propose anextension to the reference architecture for XACML.

The min-dist location selection query,Jianzhong Qi; Rui Zhang; Lars Kulik; Dan Lin; Yuan Xue,We propose and study a new type of location optimization problem: given a set of clients anda set of existing facilities; we select a location from a given set of potential locations forestablishing a new facility so that the average distance between a client and her nearestfacility is minimized. We call this problem the min-dist location selection problem; which hasa wide range of applications in urban development simulation; massively multiplayer onlinegames; and decision support systems. We explore two common approaches to locationoptimization problems and propose methods based on those approaches for solving thisnew problem. However; those methods either need to maintain an extra index or fall short inefficiency. To address their drawbacks; we propose a novel method (named MND); whichhas very close performance to the fastest method but does not need an extra index.

A highly optimized algorithm for continuous intersection join queries over moving objects,Rui Zhang; Jianzhong Qi; Dan Lin; Wei Wang; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract Given two sets of moving objects with nonzero extents; the continuous intersectionjoin query reports every pair of intersecting objects; one from each of the two moving objectsets; for every timestamp. This type of queries is important for a number of applications; eg;in the multi-billion dollar computer game industry; massively multiplayer online games likeWorld of Warcraft need to monitor the intersection among players' attack ranges and renderplayers' interaction in real time. The computational cost of a straightforward algorithm or analgorithm adapted from another query type is prohibitive; and answering the query in realtime poses a great challenge. Those algorithms compute the query answer for either toolong or too short a time interval; which results in either a very large computation cost peranswer update or too frequent answer updates; respectively. This observation motivates …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2012,44
Continuous intersection joins over moving objects,Rui Zhang; Dan Lin; Kotagiri Ramamohanarao; Elisa Bertino,The continuous intersection join query is computationally expensive yet important for variousapplications on moving objects. No previous study has specifically addressed this querytype. We can adopt a naive algorithm or extend an existing technique (TP-Join) to processthe query. However; they compute the answer for either too long or too short a time interval;which results in either a very large computation cost per object update or too frequentanswer updates; respectively. This motivates us to optimize the query processing in the timedimension. In this study; we achieve this optimization by introducing the new concept of time-constrained (TC) processing. Further; TC processing enables a set of effective improvementtechniques on traditional intersection join algorithms.

Location privacy in moving-object environments,Dan Lin; Elisa Bertino; Reynold Cheng; Sunil Prabhakar,The expanding use of location-based services has profound implications on the privacy ofpersonal information. If no adequate protection is adopted; information about movements ofspecific individuals could be disclosed to unauthorized subjects or organizations; thusresulting in privacy breaches. In this paper; we propose a framework for preserving locationprivacy in moving-object environments. Our approach is based on the idea of sending to theservice provider suitably modified location information. Such modifications; that includetransformations like scaling; are performed by agents interposed between users and serviceproviders.

A three-dimensional node snapping algorithm ispresented to modify the topology of deformable models; without adding new elements.Smooth cut is generated by duplicating and displacing mass points that have been snappedalong the cutting path. Several sets of triangles representing different soft tissues aregenerated along the new cut to present the internal structures and material properties ofheterogeneous deformable objects.

Most VANET applications are enabled by different routing protocols. The design ofsuch routing protocols; however; is quite challenging due to the dynamic nature of nodes(vehicles) in VANETs. To exploit the unique characteristics of VANET nodes; we design amoving-zone based architecture in which vehicles collaborate with one another to formdynamic moving zones so as to facilitate information dissemination.

High-assurance integrity techniques for databases,Elisa Bertino; Chenyun Dai; Hyo-Sang Lim; Dan Lin,Abstract With the increased need of data sharing among multiple organizations; such asgovernment organizations; financial corporations; medical hospitals and academicinstitutions; it is critical to ensure data integrity so that effective decisions can be made basedon these data. In this paper; we first present an architecture for a comprehensive integritycontrol system based on data validation and metadata management. We then discuss animportant issue in the data validation; that is; the evaluation of data provenance and proposea trust model for estimating the trustworthiness of data and data providers. By taking intoaccount confidence about data provenance; we introduce an approach for policy observingquery evaluation as a complement to the integrity control system.,British National Conference on Databases,2008,14

Information-oriented trustworthiness evaluation in vehicular ad-hoc networks,Sashi Gurung; Dan Lin; Anna Squicciarini; Elisa Bertino,Abstract In Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs); applications are typically realized byforwarding and exchanging messages among vehicles. The integrity and trustworthiness ofmessages directly impacts the quality of the applications. Though there have been extensiveworks on authentication protocols in VANETs; authentication can only certify message originbut cannot guarantee that the identity holders will send truthful and accurate messages.Therefore; in this paper; we propose a novel trust model to directly evaluate thetrustworthiness of the content of a message received from other vehicles. The model is builtbased on various factors such as content similarity; content conflict and route similarity.Trustworthiness of message content will be evaluated at the individual vehicle level and willnot introduce any additional architectural assumptions.

Optimizing moving queries over moving object data streams,Dan Lin; Bin Cui; Dongqing Yang,Abstract With the increasing in demand on location-based aware services and RFIDs;efficient processing of continuous queries over moving object streams becomes important. Inthis paper; we propose an efficient in-memory processing of continuous queries on themoving object streams. We model moving objects using function of time and use it in theprediction of usefulness of objects with respect to the continuous queries. To effectivelyutilize the limited memory; we derive several replacement policies to discard objects that areof no potential interest to the queries and design efficient algorithms with light datastructures. Experimental studies are conducted and the results show that our proposedmethod is both memory and query efficient.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,11
Influence-Aware predictive density queries under road-network constraints,Lasanthi Heendaliya; Michael Wisely; Dan Lin; Sahra Sedigh Sarvestani; Ali Hurson,Abstract Density query is a very useful query type that informs users about highlyconcentrated/dense regions; such as a traffic jam; so as to reschedule their travel plans tosave time. However; existing products and research work on density queries still haveseveral limitations which; if can be resolved; will bring more significant benefits to oursociety. For example; we identify an important problem that has never been studied before.That is none of the existing works on traffic prediction consider the influence of the predicteddense regions on the subsequent traffic flow. Specifically; if road A is estimated to becongested at timestamp t_1; the prediction of the condition on other roads after t_1 shouldconsider the traffic blocked by road A. In this paper; we formally model such influencebetween multiple density queries and propose an efficient query algorithm.

Monochromatic and bichromatic mutual skyline queries,Tao Jiang; Yunjun Gao; Bin Zhang; Dan Lin; Qing Li,Abstract In this paper; we study a new skyline operator; namely; mutual skyline query (MSQ);which retrieves all the data objects that are contained in the dynamic skyline and meanwhilethe reverse skyline of a specified query object q. MSQ has many applications such asmarketing analysis; task allocation; and personalized matching. Motivated by this; we firstformalize MSQ in both monochromatic and bichromatic cases; and then propose severalalgorithms for processing MSQ. Our methods utilize a conventional data-partitioning indexon the dataset; employ the advantage of reusing technique; and exploit effective pruningheuristics to improve the query processing. Extensive experiments using both real andsynthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithmsunder various experimental settings.,Expert systems with applications,2014,10
Query processing techniques for compliance with data confidence policies,Chenyun Dai; Dan Lin; Murat Kantarcioglu; Elisa Bertino; Ebru Celikel; Bhavani Thuraisingham,Abstract Data integrity and quality is a very critical issue in many data-intensive decision-making applications. In such applications; decision makers need to be provided with highquality data on which they can rely on with high confidence. A key issue is that obtaininghigh quality data may be very expensive. We thus need flexible solutions to the problem ofdata integrity and quality. This paper proposes one such solution based on four keyelements. The first element is the association of a confidence value with each data item inthe database. The second element is the computation of the confidence values of queryresults by using lineage propagation. The third element is the notion of confidence policies.Such a policy restricts access to the query results by specifying the minimum confidencelevel that is required for use in a certain task by a certain subject. The fourth element is an …,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2009,10
Towards optimal utilization of main memory for moving object indexing,Bin Cui; Dan Lin; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract In moving object databases; existing disk-based indexes are unable to keep up withthe high update rate while providing speedy retrieval at the same time. However; efficientmanagement of moving-object database can be achieved through aggressive use of mainmemory. In this paper; we propose an Integrated Memory Partitioning and Activity ConsciousTwin-index (IMPACT) framework where the moving object database is indexed by a pair ofindexes based on the properties of the objects' movement–a main-memory structuremanages active objects while a disk-based index handles inactive objects. As objectsbecome active (or inactive); they dynamically migrate from one structure to the other.Moreover; the main memory is also organized into two partitions–one for the main memoryindex; and the other as buffers for the frequently accessed nodes of the disk-based index …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2005,10
Indexing fast moving objects for knn queries based on nearest landmarks,Dan Lin; Rui Zhang; Aoying Zhou,Abstract With the rapid advancements in positioning technologies such as the GlobalPositioning System (GPS) and wireless communications; the tracking of continuouslymoving objects has become more convenient. However; this development poses newchallenges to database technology since maintaining up-to-date information regarding thelocation of moving objects incurs an enormous amount of updates. Existing indexes can nolonger keep up with the high update rate while providing speedy retrieval at the same time.This study aims to improve k nearest neighbor (kNN) query performance while reducingupdate costs. Our approach is based on an important observation that queries usually occuraround certain places or spatial landmarks of interest; called reference points.

However;existing brokerage schemes on cloud service selection typically assume that brokers arecompletely trusted; and do not provide any guarantee over the correctness of the servicerecommendations. It is then possible for a compromised or dishonest broker to easily takeadvantage of the limited capabilities of the clients and provide incorrect or incompleteresponses.

This raises a number of security and privacy concerns regardingone's sensitive data such as health records. For example; according to Canadian laws; datarelated to personal identifiable information must be stored within Canada. Nevertheless; incontrast to the urgent demands; privacy requirements regarding to cloud storage locationshave not been well investigated in the current cloud computing market; fostering securityand privacy concerns among potential adopters.

Traffic information publication with privacy preservation,Sashi Gurung; Dan Lin; Wei Jiang; Ali Hurson; Rui Zhang,Abstract We are experiencing the expanding use of location-based services such as AT&T'sTeleNav GPS Navigator and Intel's Thing Finder. Existing location-based services havecollected a large amount of location data; which has great potential for statistical usage inapplications like traffic flow analysis; infrastructure planning; and advertisementdissemination. The key challenge is how to wisely use the data without violating each user'slocation privacy concerns.

A moving-object index for efficient query processing with peer-wise location privacy,Dan Lin; Christian S Jensen; Rui Zhang; Lu Xiao; Jiaheng Lu,Abstract With the growing use of location-based services; location privacy attracts increasingattention from users; industry; and the research community. While considerable effort hasbeen devoted to inventing techniques that prevent service providers from knowing a user'sexact location; relatively little attention has been paid to enabling so-called peer-wiseprivacy---the protection of a user's location from unauthorized peer users. This paperidentifies an important efficiency problem in existing peer-privacy approaches that simplyapply a filtering step to identify users that are located in a query range; but that do not wantto disclose their location to the querying peer. To solve this problem; we propose a novel;privacy-policy enabled index called the PEB-tree that seamlessly integrates locationproximity and policy compatibility. We propose efficient algorithms that use the PEB-tree …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,8

Though searchable encryption allows users to encrypt their stored data whilepreserving some search capabilities; few efforts have sought to consider the reliability of thesearchable encrypted data outsourced to the clouds. In this paper; we propose a privacy-preserving STorage and REtrieval (STRE) mechanism that not only ensures security andprivacy but also provides reliability guarantees for the outsourced searchable encrypteddata.

Incremental evaluation of top-k combinatorial metric skyline query,Tao Jiang; Bin Zhang; Dan Lin; Yunjun Gao; Qing Li,Abstract In this paper; we define a novel type of skyline query; namely top-k combinatorialmetric skyline (kCMS) query. The kCMS query aims to find k combinations of data pointsaccording to a monotonic preference function such that each combination has the queryobject in its metric skyline. The kCMS query will enable a new set of location-basedapplications that the traditional skyline queries cannot offer. To answer the kCMS query; wepropose two efficient query algorithms; which leverage a suite of techniques including thesorting and threshold mechanisms; reusing technique; and heuristics pruning toincrementally and quickly generate combinations of possible query results.

Continuous predictive line queries for on-the-go traffic estimation,Lasanthi Heendaliya; Dan Lin; Ali Hurson,Abstract Traffic condition is one vital piece of information that any commuter would wish toobtain to plan an efficient route. However; most existing works monitor and report onlycurrent traffic; which makes it too late for commuters to change their routes when they realizethey are already stuck in the traffic. Therefore; in this paper; we propose a traffic predictionapproach by defining and solving a novel continuous predictive line query. The continuouspredictive line query aims to accurately estimate traffic conditions in the near future based oncurrent movement of vehicles on the roads; and continuously update the predicted trafficconditions as vehicles move. The predicted traffic condition will not only help redirectcommuters in advance but also help relieve the overall traffic congestion problem.

An important step in policy integration is to analyze thesimilarity of policies. Existing approaches to policy similarity analysis are mainly based onlogical reasoning and Boolean function comparison.

First; the existing authentication servers typically collect the plaintext of users'facial images in order to conduct authentication. If the servers are compromised; theattackers would obtain the users' facial images and can easily impersonate the users in anyother applications that use face authentication. Second; it is also hard to prevent attackersfrom using facial images published in social network sites to impersonate the true user. Inthis paper; we conquered these two issues by proposing a novel secure face authenticationsystem; called UFace. UFace uses special close-up facial images (which cannot be found …,Computers & Security,2017,*
PAS: policy-based assistance in sensor networks,Jingwei Li; Adam Bowers; Dan Lin; Peng Jiang; Wei Jiang,Abstract During the last one and a half decades; wireless sensor networks (WSNs) havewitnessed significant growth and tremendous development. While enjoying the wide varietyof applications; the sensors in WSN have constrained resources; affecting their living lives;working times; assigned tasks; etc. Though a large number of efforts have been devoted intodesigning protocols that save energy as much as possible; they are still a passive solution.In this paper; we propose a novel approach called policy-based assistance system (PAS)that addresses the issue of resource limitation in a proactive manner. Complementary toexisting works which focus on saving energy in individual nodes; our proposed approachfurther allows sensors with limited resources to make requests to other sensors to helpcomplete the tasks. In this way; the resources in the whole WSN are better utilized and …,Computing,2017,*
Unraveling the genetic cause of a consanguineous family with unilateral coloboma and retinoschisis: expanding the phenotypic variability of RAX mutations,Xiu-Feng Huang; Zhi-Qin Huang; Dan Lin; Ma-Li Dai; Qing-Feng Wang; Zhen-Ji Chen; Zi-Bing Jin; Yuqin Wang,Abstract Ocular coloboma is a common eye malformation arising from incomplete closure ofthe human optic fissure during development. Multiple genetic mutations contribute to thedisease process; showing extensive genetic heterogeneity and complexity of colobomaspectrum diseases. In this study; we aimed to unravel the genetic cause of aconsanguineous family with unilateral coloboma and retinoschisis. The subjects wererecruited and underwent specialized ophthalmologic clinical examination. A combination ofwhole exome sequencing (WES); homozygosity mapping; and comprehensive variantanalyses was performed to uncover the causative mutation. Only one homozygous mutation(c. 113 T> C; p.

MELT: Mapreduce-based Efficient Large-scale Trajectory Anonymization,Katrina Ward; Dan Lin; Sanjay Madria,Abstract With the proliferation of location-based services enabled by a large number ofmobile devices and applications; the quantity of location data; such as trajectories collectedby service providers; is gigantic. If these datasets could be published; they will be valuableassets to various service providers to explore business opportunities; to governments toresearch commuter behavior for better transport management; and could also greatly benefitthe general public for day to day commute. However; there are two major concerns thatconsiderably limit the availability and the usage of these trajectory datasets. The first is thethreat to individual privacy as users' trajectories may be tracked by an adversary to discoversensitive information; such as home locations; their children's school locations; or socialinformation like habits or relationships. The other concern is the ability to analyze the …,Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2017,*
Poster: A Location-Privacy Approach for Continuous Queries,Douglas Steiert; Dan Lin; Quincy Conduff; Wei Jiang,Abstract With the prevalence of smartphones; mobile apps have become more and morepopular. However; many mobile apps request location information of the user. If there isnothing in place for location privacy; these mobile app users are in great risk of beingtracked by malicious parties. Although the location privacy problem has been studiedextensively by resorting to a third-party location anonymizer; there is very little work thatallows the users to fully control the disclosure of their data using their smartphones alone. Inthis paper; we propose a novel Android App called MoveWithMe which automaticallygenerates mocking locations. Most importantly; these mocking locations are not random likethose generated by original Android location mocking function. The proposed MoveWithMeapp generates k traces of mocking locations and ensures that each trace looks like a …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM on Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies,2017,*
Real-Time Detection of Illegal File Transfers in the Cloud,Adam Bowers; Dan Lin; Anna Squicciarini; Ali Hurson,There has been a prolific rise in the popularityof cloud storage in recent years. While cloudstorage offersmany advantages such as flexibility and convenience; users arenow unable totell or control the actual locations of their data. This limitation may affect users' confidenceand trust in thestorage provider; or even be unsuitable for storing data withstrict locationrequirements. To address this issue; we proposean illegal file transfer detection frameworkthat constantlymonitors the real-time file transfers in the cloud and is capableof detectingpotential illegal transfers which moves sensitivedata outside the (" legal") boundariesspecified by the fileowner. The main idea is to classifying multiple users' locationpreferences when making the data storage arrangement inthe cloud nodes.

Automatic Privacy Prediction to Accelerate Social Image Sharing,Zhenzhong Kuang; Zongmin Li; Dan Lin; Jianping Fan,The manual process for privacy setting could be very time-consuming and challenging forcommon users. By assuming that there are hidden correlations between the visualproperties of images (ie; visual features) or object classes and the privacy settings for imagesharing; an effective algorithm is developed in this paper to achieve automatic prediction ofimage privacy; so that the best-matching privacy setting can be recommended automaticallyfor each single image being shared. Our algorithm for automatic image privacy predictioncontains two approaches:(a) feature-based approach by learning more representative deepfeatures and discriminative classifier for assigning each single image being shared into oneof two categories: private vs. public;(b) object-based approach by detecting large numbers ofprivacy-sensitive object classes and events automatically and leveraging them to achieve …,Multimedia Big Data (BigMM); 2017 IEEE Third International Conference on,2017,*
From Tag to Protect: A Tag-Driven Policy Recommender System for Image Sharing,Anna Squicciarini; Andrea Novelli; Dan Lin; Cornelia Caragea; Haoti Zhong,Abstract—Sharing images on social network sites has become a part of daily routine formore and more online users. However; in face of the considerable amount of images sharedonline; it is not a trivial task for a person to manually configure proper privacy settings foreach of the images that he/she uploaded. The lack of proper privacy protection during imagesharing could raise many potential privacy breaches of people's private lives that they arenot aware of. In this work; we propose a privacy setting recommender system to help peopleeffortlessly set up the privacy settings for their online images. The key idea is developedbased on our finding that there are certain correlations between a number of genericpatterns of image privacy settings and image tags; regardless of the image owners'individual privacy bias and levels of awareness.

UFace: Your Universal Password That No One Can See.,Nicholas Hilbert; Christian S Jensen; Dan Lin; Wei Jiang,Abstract—With the advantage of not having to memorize long passwords; people are moreinterested in adopting face authentication for use with mobile devices. However; since facialimages are widely shared in social networking sites; it becomes a challenging task tosecurely employ face authentication for web services to prevent attackers fromimpersonating the legal users by using the users' online face photos. Moreover; existing faceauthentication protocols either require users to disclose their unencrypted facial images tothe authentication server or require users to execute computationally expensive securemultiparty computation protocols. For mobile devices with limited computational power; thispresents a problem that cannot be overlooked.

The first is cryptography;which conceals plain text information using mathematical transformations. The second isaccess control; which defines the parties permitted access to certain parts of the system orcertain pieces of information. The third is authorization; which determines what actions eachauthorized party is allowed to do with a piece of data or a system module [1–3].

Indexing and Querying Techniques for Moving Objects in Both Euclidean Space and Road Network,Lasanthi Heendaliya; Michael Wisely; Dan Lin; S Sedigh Sarvestani; Ali Hurson,Abstract Location-dependent query is a service that enables users to acquire real-timelocation-dependent information on mobile objects. This type of service is challenged by thesize and volatility of the underlying data. This challenge has created the need for newmethods that allow users to efficiently access; retrieve; and update volatile mobile objectdata. Motivated by this necessity; this chapter explores and discusses research challengesand issues regarding indexing and querying mobile data. The support for predictive querieson road-network constrained mobile objects is a major deficiency in the existing research.This chapter also presents performance evaluation on some solutions of indexing mobileobjects as well as their supported predictive queries under the road-network constraints.,*,2016,*

While efficient; MapReduce offers very complicated (if any) means for users torequest nodes that satisfy certain security and privacy requirements to process their data. Inthis paper; we propose a novel approach to seamlessly integrate node selection control tothe MapReduce framework for increasing data security. We define a succinct yet expressivepolicy language for MapReduce environments; according to which users can specify theirsecurity and privacy concerns over their data. Then; we propose corresponding datapreprocessing techniques and node verification protocols to achieve strong policyenforcement.

A Moving Object Index For Efficient Query Processing with Peer-wise Location Privacy Protection,Lu Xiao; Christian S Jensen; Dan Lin; Rui Zhang; Jiaheng Lu,*,*,2011,*
Interoperability; XML Schema,Shashi Shekhar; Hui Xiong,The iDistance is an indexing and query processing technique for k nearest neighbor (kNN)queries on point data in multi-dimensional metric spaces. The kNN query is one of thehardest problems on multi-dimensional data. It has been shown analytically andexperimentally that any algorithm using hierarchical index structure based on either space-or data-partitioning is less efficient than the naive method of sequentially checking everydata record (called the sequential scan) in high-dimensional spaces [4]. Some datadistributions including the uniform distribution are particularly hard cases [1]. The iDistanceis designed to process kNN queries in high-dimensional spaces efficiently and it isespecially good for skewed data distributions; which usually occur in real-life data sets. Foruniform data; the iDistance beats the sequential scan up to 30 dimensions as reported in …,Encyclopedia of GIS,2008,*

Efficient indexing of the historical; and future positions of moving,D Lin; CS Jensen; BC Ooi; S Šaltenis,Although significant effort has been put into the development of efficient spatio-temporalindexing techniques for moving objects; little attention has been given to the development oftechniques that efficiently support queries about the past; present; and future positions ofobjects. The provisioning of such techniques is challenging; both because of the nature ofthe data; which reflects continuous movement; and because of the types of queries to besupported. This paper proposes the BBx-index structure; which indexes the positions ofmoving objects; given as linear functions of time; at any time. The index stores linearizedmoving-object locations in a forest of B+-trees. The index supports queries that selectobjects based on temporal and spatial constraints; such as queries that retrieve all objectswhose positions fall within a spatial range during a set of time intervals.
