Peertrust: Supporting reputation-based trust for peer-to-peer electronic communities,Li Xiong; Ling Liu,Peer-to-peer (P2P) online communities are commonly perceived as an environment offeringboth opportunities and threats. One way to minimize threats in such communities is to usecommunity-based reputations to help estimate the trustworthiness of peers. We presentPeerTrust-a reputation-based trust supporting framework; which includes a coherentadaptive trust model for quantifying and comparing the trustworthiness of peers based on atransaction-based feedback system; and a decentralized implementation of such a modelover a structured P2P network. PeerTrust model has two main features. First; we introducethree basic trust parameters and two adaptive factors in computing trustworthiness of peers;namely; feedback a peer receives from other peers; the total number of transactions a peerperforms; the credibility of the feedback sources; transaction context factor; and the …,IEEE transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,2219

TrustGuard: countering vulnerabilities in reputation management for decentralized overlay networks,Mudhakar Srivatsa; Li Xiong; Ling Liu,Abstract Reputation systems have been popular in estimating the trustworthiness andpredicting the future behavior of nodes in a large-scale distributed system where nodes maytransact with one another without prior knowledge or experience. One of the fundamentalchallenges in distributed reputation management is to understand vulnerabilities anddevelop mechanisms that can minimize the potential damages to a system by maliciousnodes. In this paper; we identify three vulnerabilities that are detrimental to decentralizedreputation management and propose TrustGuard-a safeguard framework for providing ahighly dependable and yet efficient reputation system. First; we provide a dependable trustmodel and a set of formal methods to handle strategic malicious nodes that continuouslychange their behavior to gain unfair advantages in the system. Second; a transaction …,Proceedings of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web,2005,383
Building trust in decentralized peer-to-peer electronic communities,Li Xiong; Ling Liu,Abstract Many players in electronic markets have to cope with much higher amount ofuncertainty as to quality and reliability of the products they buy and the information theyobtain from other peers in the respective online business communities. One way to addressthis uncertainty problem is to use information such as feedbacks about past experiences tohelp making recommendation and judgment on product quality and information reliability.This paper presents PeerTrust; a simple yet effective reputation-based trust mechanism forquantifying and comparing the trustworthiness of peers in a decentralized peer-to-peerelectronic marketplace. There are three main contributions in this paper. First; we argue thatthe trust models based solely on feedbacks from other peers in the community is inaccurateand ineffective.

Publishing set-valued data via differential privacy,Rui Chen; Noman Mohammed; Benjamin CM Fung; Bipin C Desai; Li Xiong,ABSTRACT Set-valued data provides enormous opportunities for various data mining tasks.In this paper; we study the problem of publishing set-valued data for data mining tasks underthe rigorous differential privacy model. All existing data publishing methods for set-valueddata are based on partitionbased privacy models; for example k-anonymity; which arevulnerable to privacy attacks based on background knowledge. In contrast; differentialprivacy provides strong privacy guarantees independent of an adversary's backgroundknowledge and computational power. Existing data publishing approaches for differentialprivacy; however; are not adequate in terms of both utility and scalability in the context of set-valued data due to its high dimensionality. We demonstrate that set-valued data could beefficiently released under differential privacy with guaranteed utility with the help of …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,173

In this paper; we study the problem of differentiallyprivate histogram release based on an interactive differential privacy interface. We proposetwo multidimensional partitioning strategies including a baseline cell-based partitioning andan innovative kd-tree based partitioning. In addition to providing formal proofs for differentialprivacy and usefulness guarantees for linear distributive queries; we also present a set ofexperimental results and demonstrate the feasibility and performance of our method.,Workshop on Secure Data Management,2010,122
p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 promotes invasion and metastasis of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells,Sumin Kang; Shannon Elf; Katherine Lythgoe; Taro Hitosugi; Jack Taunton; Wei Zhou; Li Xiong; Dongsheng Wang; Susan Muller; Songqing Fan; Shi-Yong Sun; Adam I Marcus; Ting-Lei Gu; Roberto D Polakiewicz; Fadlo R Khuri; Dong M Shin; Jing Chen,Abstract Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the most commontypes of human cancer and frequently metastasizes to LNs. Identifying metastasis-promotingfactors is of immense clinical interest; as the prognosis for patients with even a singleunilateral LN metastasis is extremely poor. Here; we report that p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2(RSK2) promotes human HNSCC cell invasion and metastasis. We determined that RSK2was overexpressed and activated in highly invasive HNSCC cell lines compared with poorlyinvasive cell lines. Expression of RSK2 also correlated with metastatic progression inpatients with HNSCC. Ectopic expression of RSK2 substantially enhanced the invasivecapacity of HNSCC cells; while inhibition of RSK2 activity led to marked attenuation ofinvasion in vitro. Additionally; shRNA knockdown of RSK2 substantially reduced the …,The Journal of clinical investigation,2010,109
Anonymizing user profiles for personalized web search,Yun Zhu; Li Xiong; Christopher Verdery,Abstract We study the problem of anonymizing user profiles so that user privacy issufficiently protected while the anonymized profiles are still effective in enablingpersonalized web search. We propose a Bayes-optimal privacy notion to bound the priorand posterior probability of associating a user with an individual term in the anonymizeduser profile set. We also propose a novel bundling technique that clusters user profiles intogroups by taking into account the semantic relationships between the terms while satisfyingthe privacy constraint. We evaluate our approach through a set of preliminary experimentsusing real data demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness.,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,84
Distributed anonymization: Achieving privacy for both data subjects and data providers,Pawel Jurczyk; Li Xiong,Abstract There is an increasing need for sharing data repositories containing personalinformation across multiple distributed and private databases. However; such data sharing issubject to constraints imposed by privacy of individuals or data subjects as well as dataconfidentiality of institutions or data providers. Concretely; given a query spanning multipledatabases; query results should not contain individually identifiable information. In addition;institutions should not reveal their databases to each other apart from the query results. Inthis paper; we develop a set of decentralized protocols that enable data sharing forhorizontally partitioned databases given these constraints. Our approach includes a newnotion; l-site-diversity; for data anonymization to ensure anonymity of data providers inaddition to that of data subjects; and a distributed anonymization protocol that allows …,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2009,83
The glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose activates multiple prosurvival pathways through IGF1R,Diansheng Zhong; Li Xiong; Tongrui Liu; Xiuju Liu; Xiangguo Liu; Jing Chen; Shi-Yong Sun; Fadlo R Khuri; Yaping Zong; Qinghua Zhou; Wei Zhou,Abstract Recent molecular studies indicate that aerobic glycolysis plays an important role intumorigenesis and is a valid target for cancer therapy. Although 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) iswell characterized as a glycolytic inhibitor; we recently discovered that it activates aprosurvival oncoprotein; AKT; through PI3K. In this study; we discovered that 2-DGtreatments disrupted the binding between insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) so that the free form of IGF-1 could be released from the IGF-1·IGFBP3 complex to activate IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) signaling. Because IGF1R signaling isinvolved; PI3K/AKT constitutes only one of the prosurvival pathways that are activated by 2-DG treatment; we validated that MEK-ERK signaling was also induced in an IGF1R-dependent manner in some cancer cell lines. Furthermore; our phospho-specific antibody …,Journal of Biological Chemistry,2009,80
Querying multiple bioinformatics information sources: Can semantic web research help?,David Buttler; Matthew Coleman; Terence Critchlow; Renato Fileto; Wei Han; Calton Pu; Daniel Rocco; Li Xiong,Abstract Advances in Semantic Web and Ontologies have pushed the role of semantics to anew frontier: Semantic Composition of Web Services. A good example of such compositionsis the querying of multiple bioinformatics data sources. Supporting effective querying over alarge collection of bioinformatics data sources presents a number of unique challenges.First; queries over bioinformatics data sources are often complex associative queries overmultiple Web documents. Most associations are defined by string matching of textualfragments in two documents. Second; most of the queries required by Genomics researchersinvolve complex data extraction; and sophisticated workflows that implement the complexassociative access. Third but not the least; complex Genomics-specific queries are oftenreused many times by Genomics researchers; either directly or through some refinements …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2002,74
Spatial task assignment for crowd sensing with cloaked locations,Layla Pournajaf; Li Xiong; Vaidy Sunderam; Slawomir Goryczka,Distributed mobile crowd sensing is becoming a valuable paradigm; enabling a variety ofnovel applications built on mobile networks and smart devices. However; this trend bringsseveral challenges; including the need for crowd sourcing platforms to manage interactionsbetween applications and the crowd (participants or workers). One of the key functions ofsuch platforms is spatial task assignment which assigns sensing tasks to participants basedon their locations. Task assignment becomes critical when participants are hesitant to sharetheir locations due to privacy concerns. In this paper; we examine the problem of spatial taskassignment in crowd sensing when participants utilize spatial cloaking to obfuscate theirlocations. We investigate methods for assigning sensing tasks to participants; efficientlymanaging location uncertainty and resource constraints. We propose a novel two-stage …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2014 IEEE 15th International Conference on,2014,73
Phosphorus-containing liquid cycloaliphatic epoxy resins for reworkable environment-friendly electronic packaging materials,Wanshuang Liu; Zhonggang Wang; Li Xiong; Linni Zhao,Abstract Novel thermally reworkable; phosphorus-containing; di-and tri-functional liquidcycloaliphatic epoxy resins were designed and synthesized. Their chemical structures werecharacterized by means of MS; FTIR; 1 H NMR and 31 P NMR methods. After curing; theproducts were transparent and stable up to 220° C; while exhibited quick thermaldecomposition at the temperature range of 255–280° C. The removal test showed that; afterheat-treatment at 260° C in air atmosphere for only 4 min; the residual char on the glasssubstrate could be easily wiped off. This unique degradation behavior was attributed to thesynergistic effect of two factors: the thermally-labile phosphate groups evenly distributedwithin the three-dimensional network and the in-situ catalyzing of phosphoric acid generatedfrom the cleavage of phosphate bond on the pyrolysis of adjacent other phosphate and …,Polymer,2010,68
Preserving data privacy in outsourcing data aggregation services,Li Xiong; Subramanyam Chitti; Ling Liu,Abstract Advances in distributed service-oriented computing and Internet technology haveformed a strong technology push for outsourcing and information sharing. There is anincreasing need for organizations to share their data across organization boundaries bothwithin the country and with countries that may have lesser privacy and security standards.Ideally; we wish to share certain statistical data and extract the knowledge from the privatedatabases without revealing any additional information of each individual database apartfrom the aggregate result that is permitted. In this article; we describe two scenarios foroutsourcing data aggregation services and present a set of decentralized peer-to-peerprotocols for supporting data sharing across multiple private databases while minimizing thedata disclosure among individual parties.

Protecting locations with differential privacy under temporal correlations,Yonghui Xiao; Li Xiong,Abstract Concerns on location privacy frequently arise with the rapid development of GPSenabled devices and location-based applications. While spatial transformation techniquessuch as location perturbation or generalization have been studied extensively; mosttechniques rely on syntactic privacy models without rigorous privacy guarantee. Many ofthem only consider static scenarios or perturb the location at single timestamps withoutconsidering temporal correlations of a moving user's locations; and hence are vulnerable tovarious inference attacks. While differential privacy has been accepted as a standard forprivacy protection; applying differential privacy in location based applications presents newchallenges; as the protection needs to be enforced on the fly for a single user and needs toincorporate temporal correlations between a user's locations. In this paper; we propose a …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2015,63

Service-oriented architecture for high-dimensional private data mashup,Benjamin CM Fung; Thomas Trojer; Patrick CK Hung; Li Xiong; Khalil Al-Hussaeni; Rachida Dssouli,Mashup is a web technology that allows different service providers to flexibly integrate theirexpertise and to deliver highly customizable services to their customers. Data mashup is aspecial type of mashup application that aims at integrating data from multiple data providersdepending on the user's request. However; integrating data from multiple sources bringsabout three challenges: 1) Simply joining multiple private data sets together would revealthe sensitive information to the other data providers. 2) The integrated (mashup) data couldpotentially sharpen the identification of individuals and; therefore; reveal their person-specific sensitive information that was not available before the mashup. 3) The mashup datafrom multiple sources often contain many data attributes.

The toolextends traditional record linkage tools with a richer set of parameters. Users maysystematically and iteratively explore the optimal combination of parameter values toenhance linking performance and accuracy. Results of linking a birth defects monitoringprogram and birth certificate data using FRIL show 99% precision and 95% recall rateswhen compared to results obtained through handcrafted algorithms; and the process tooksignificantly less time to complete. Experience and experimental result suggest that FRILhas the potential to increase the accuracy of data linkage across all studies involving recordlinkage. In particular; FRIL will enable researchers to assess objectively the quality of linkeddata.,AMIA annual symposium proceedings,2008,50

$ m $-Privacy for Collaborative Data Publishing,Slawomir Goryczka; Li Xiong; Benjamin CM Fung,In this paper; we consider the collaborative data publishing problem for anonymizinghorizontally partitioned data at multiple data providers. We consider a new type of “insiderattack” by colluding data providers who may use their own data records (a subset of theoverall data) to infer the data records contributed by other data providers. The paperaddresses this new threat; and makes several contributions. First; we introduce the notion ofm-privacy; which guarantees that the anonymized data satisfies a given privacy constraintagainst any group of up to m colluding data providers.

A two-phase algorithm for mining sequential patterns with differential privacy,Luca Bonomi; Li Xiong,Abstract Frequent sequential pattern mining is a central task in many fields such as biologyand finance. However; release of these patterns is raising increasing concerns on individualprivacy. In this paper; we study the sequential pattern mining problem under the differentialprivacy framework which provides formal and provable guarantees of privacy. Due to thenature of the differential privacy mechanism which perturbs the frequency results with noise;and the high dimensionality of the pattern space; this mining problem is particularlychallenging. In this work; we propose a novel two-phase algorithm for mining both prefixesand substring patterns. In the first phase; our approach takes advantage of the statisticalproperties of the data to construct a model-based prefix tree which is used to mine prefixesand a candidate set of substring patterns. The frequency of the substring patterns is …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,42
Mining multiple private databases using a knn classifier,Li Xiong; Subramanyam Chitti; Ling Liu,Abstract Modern electronic communication has collapsed geographical boundaries forglobal information sharing but often at the expense of data security and privacy boundaries.Distributed privacy preserving data mining tools are increasingly becoming critical for miningmultiple databases with a minimum information disclosure. We present a frameworkincluding a general model as well as multi-round algorithms for mining horizontallypartitioned databases using a privacy preserving k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier. Asalient feature of our approach is that it offers a trade-off between accuracy; efficiency andprivacy through multi-round protocols.,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2007,38
Topk queries across multiple private databases,Li Xiong; Subramanyam Chitti; Ling Liu,Advances in distributed service-oriented computing and global communications haveformed a strong technology push for large-scale data integration among organizations andenterprises.

Frequent pattern mining for kernel trace data,Christopher LaRosa; Li Xiong; Ken Mandelberg,Abstract Operating systems engineers have developed tracing tools that log details aboutprocess execution at the kernel level. These tools make it easier to understand the actualexecution that takes place on real systems. Unfortunately; uncovering certain types of usefulinformation in kernel trace data is nearly impossible through manual inspection of a tracelog. To detect interesting interprocess communication patterns and other recurring runtimeexecution patterns in operating system trace logs; we employ data mining techniques; inparticular; frequent pattern mining.

To this end; private user datamust be aggregated and shared continuously over time with data privacy guarantee.However; releasing time series data with standard differential privacy mechanism can leadto high perturbation error due to the correlation between time stamps. In addition; datasparsity in the spatial domain imposes another challenge to user privacy as well as utility.

Secure multiparty aggregation with differential privacy: A comparative study,Slawomir Goryczka; Li Xiong; Vaidy Sunderam,Abstract This paper considers the problem of secure data aggregation in a distributed settingwhile preserving differential privacy for the aggregated data. In particular; we focus on thesecure sum aggregation. Security is guaranteed by secure multiparty computation protocolsusing well known security schemes: Shamir's secret sharing; perturbation-based; andvarious encryption schemes. Differential privacy of the final result is achieved by distributedLaplace perturbation mechanism (DLPA). Partial random noise is generated by allparticipants; which draw random variables from Gamma or Gaussian distributions; such thatthe aggregated noise follows Laplace distribution to satisfy differential privacy. We alsointroduce a new efficient distributed noise generation scheme with partial noise drawn fromLaplace distributions.,Proceedings of the Joint EDBT/ICDT 2013 Workshops,2013,28

HIDE is a framework we developed for integrating heterogenousstructured and unstructured health information and provides methods for privacy preservingdata publishing. The DPCube component uses differentially private access mechanisms andan innovative 2-phase multidimensional partitioning strategy to publish a multi-dimensionaldata cube or histogram that achieves good utility while satisfying differential privacy.

However; to this date there have been no tools for releasingreal-time aggregated data with differential privacy; a strong and provable privacy guarantee.We propose FAST; a real-time system that allows differentially private aggregate sharingand time-series analytics.

Differentially private histogram publication for dynamic datasets: an adaptive sampling approach,Haoran Li; Li Xiong; Xiaoqian Jiang; Jinfei Liu,Abstract Differential privacy has recently become a de facto standard for private statisticaldata release. Many algorithms have been proposed to generate differentially privatehistograms or synthetic data. However; most of them focus on" one-time" release of a staticdataset and do not adequately address the increasing need of releasing series of dynamicdatasets in real time. A straightforward application of existing histogram methods on eachsnapshot of such dynamic datasets will incur high accumulated error due to thecomposibility of differential privacy and correlations or overlapping users between thesnapshots. In this paper; we address the problem of releasing series of dynamic datasets inreal time with differential privacy; using a novel adaptive distance-based samplingapproach.

Dynamic data driven crowd sensing task assignment,Layla Pournajaf; Li Xiong; Vaidy Sunderam,Abstract To realize the full potential of mobile crowd sensing; techniques are needed to dealwith uncertainty in participant locations and trajectories. We propose a novel model forspatial task assignment in mobile crowd sensing that uses a dynamic and adaptive datadriven scheme to assign moving participants with uncertain trajectories to sensing tasks; in anear-optimal manner. Our scheme is based on building a mobility model from publiclyavailable trajectory history and estimating posterior location values using noisy/uncertainmeasurements upon which initial tasking assignments are made. These assignments maybe refined locally (using exact information) and used by participants to steer their future datacollection; which completes the feedback loop.

In this paper; we study the problem of differentiallyprivate histogram release for random workloads. We study two multidimensional partitioningstrategies including: 1) a baseline cell-based partitioning strategy for releasing an equi-width cell histogram; and 2) an innovative 2-phase kd-tree based partitioning strategy forreleasing a v-optimal histogram. We formally analyze the utility of the released histogramsand quantify the errors for answering linear queries such as counting queries. We formallycharacterize the property of the input data that will guarantee the optimality of the algorithm.Finally; we implement and experimentally evaluate several applications using the releasedhistograms; including counting queries; classification; and blocking for record linkage and …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1202.5358,2012,23

While this paradigm is immensely useful;it involves the collection of detailed information from sensors and their carriers (ieparticipants) during task management processes including sensor recruitment and taskdistribution. Such information might compromise participant privacy in various regards byidentification or disclosure of sensitive attributes–thereby increasing vulnerability andsubsequently reducing participation. In this survey; we identify different task managementapproaches in mobile crowd sensing; and assess the threats to participant privacy whenpersonal information is disclosed. We also outline how privacy mechanisms are utilized inexisting sensing applications to address these threats. Finally; we discuss continuing …,Dept. Math. Comput.

Finding pareto optimal groups: group-based skyline,Jinfei Liu; Li Xiong; Jian Pei; Jun Luo; Haoyu Zhang,Abstract Skyline computation; aiming at identifying a set of skyline points that are notdominated by any other point; is particularly useful for multi-criteria data analysis anddecision making. Traditional skyline computation; however; is inadequate to answer queriesthat need to analyze not only individual points but also groups of points. To address this gap;we generalize the original skyline definition to the novel group-based skyline (G-Skyline);which represents Pareto optimal groups that are not dominated by other groups. In order tocompute G-Skyline groups consisting of k points efficiently; we present a novel structure thatrepresents the points in a directed skyline graph and captures the dominance relationshipsamong the points based on the first k skyline layers. We propose efficient algorithms tocompute the first k skyline layers. We then present two heuristic algorithms to efficiently …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,20
Differentially private synthesization of multi-dimensional data using copula functions,Haoran Li; Li Xiong; Xiaoqian Jiang,Abstract Differential privacy has recently emerged in private statistical data release as one ofthe strongest privacy guarantees. Most of the existing techniques that generate differentiallyprivate histograms or synthetic data only work well for single dimensional or low-dimensional histograms. They become problematic for high dimensional and large domaindata due to increased perturbation error and computation complexity. In this paper; wepropose DPCopula; a differentially private data synthesization technique using Copulafunctions for multi-dimensional data. The core of our method is to compute a differentiallyprivate copula function from which we can sample synthetic data. Copula functions are usedto describe the dependence between multivariate random vectors and allow us to build themultivariate joint distribution using one-dimensional marginal distributions. We present …,Advances in database technology: proceedings. International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2014,19

Clinical comparison of progressive aphasia associated with Alzheimer versus FTD-spectrum pathology,Li Xiong; John H Xuereb; Maria Grazia Spillantini; Karalyn Patterson; John R Hodges; Peter J Nestor,Objective Recent post-mortem studies indicate that 30–40% of patients with clinicallydiagnosed progressive aphasia (PA) have Alzheimer9s disease pathology; while theremainder have pathology in the FTD spectrum. This study aimed to compare the clinicalfeatures of patients from these two groups. Materials and methods A retrospective chartreview was conducted on 33 pathologically verified PA patients: n= 13 AD and n= 20 FTD-spectrum pathology. Demographics; global cognitive function; non-verbal memory;neuropsychiatric symptoms and structural imaging were compared between the twopathology-confirmed groups. Results The median survival was 6.3 years in the FTD groupversus 8.1 years in the AD group; in spite of the fact that onset for AD was on average 2.0years older than FTD. Features highly specific in predicting FTD-spectrum pathology were …,Journal of Neurology; Neurosurgery & Psychiatry,2011,19
Homozygous deletion of SMAD4 in breast cancer cell lines and invasive ductal carcinomas,Diansheng Zhong; Aki Morikawa; Lizheng Guo; Cecile Colpaert; Li Xiong; Aziza Nassar; Ceshi Chen; Neil Lamb; Jin-Tang Dong; Wei Zhou,Inactivation of TGF-β/SMAD4 signaling was postulated to play an important role in breastcancer development. Even though SMAD4 is located on 18q21; a region frequently lost inbreast cancers; point mutations of SMAD4 were rarely observed; implying that biallelicinactivation of SMAD4 was not necessary in the process. In this study; a novel homozygousdeletion of SMAD4 was identified in breast cancer cell line SW527 during a screening of 31breast cancer cell lines. As several breast cancer cell lines were shown to contain SMAD4homozygous deletion; we sought to develop a reliable method to access such lesions inarchived primary tumor specimens. First; a DNA quantification method was developed tomeasure as few as 5 copies of DNA templates so that the amount of genomic DNA isolatedby laser-capture microdissection can be accurately determined. Next; accurate DNA …,Cancer biology & therapy,2006,19
Differentially private distributed logistic regression using private and public data,Zhanglong Ji; Xiaoqian Jiang; Shuang Wang; Li Xiong; Lucila Ohno-Machado,Privacy protecting is an important issue in medical informatics and differential privacy is astate-of-the-art framework for data privacy research. Differential privacy offers provableprivacy against attackers who have auxiliary information; and can be applied to data miningmodels (for example; logistic regression). However; differentially private methods sometimesintroduce too much noise and make outputs less useful. Given available public data inmedical research (eg from patients who sign open-consent agreements); we can designalgorithms that use both public and private data sets to decrease the amount of noise that isintroduced. In this paper; we modify the update step in Newton-Raphson method to proposea differentially private distributed logistic regression model based on both public and privatedata. We try our algorithm on three different data sets; and show its advantage over:(1) a …,BMC medical genomics,2014,17
Privacy preserving distributed DBSCAN clustering,Jinfei Liu; Joshua Zhexue Huang; Jun Luo; Li Xiong,Abstract DBSCAN is a well-known density-based clustering algorithm which offersadvantages for finding clusters of arbitrary shapes compared to partitioning and hierarchicalclustering methods. However; there are few papers studying the DBSCAN algorithm underthe privacy preserving distributed data mining model; in which the data is distributedbetween two or more parties; and the parties cooperate to obtain the clustering resultswithout revealing the data at the individual parties. In this paper; we address the problem oftwo-party privacy preserving DBSCAN clustering. We first propose two protocols for privacypreserving DBSCAN clustering over horizontally and vertically partitioned data respectivelyand then extend them to arbitrarily partitioned data. We also provide analysis of theperformance and proof of privacy of our solution.,Proceedings of the 2012 Joint EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2012,17
Anonymizing data with quasi-sensitive attribute values,Pu Shi; Li Xiong; Benjamin Fung,Abstract We study the problem of anonymizing data with quasi-sensitive attributes. Quasi-sensitive attributes are not sensitive by themselves; but certain values or their combinationsmay be linked to external knowledge to reveal indirect sensitive information of an individual.We formalize the notion of l-diversity and t-closeness for quasi-sensitive attributes; which wecall QS l-diversity and QS t-closeness; to prevent indirect sensitive attribute disclosure. Wepropose a two-phase anonymization algorithm that combines quasi-identifying valuegeneralization and quasi-sensitive value suppression to achieve QS l-diversity and QS t-closeness.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,17
Countering feedback sparsity and manipulation in reputation systems,Li Xiong; Ling Liu; Mustaque Ahamad,Reputation systems provide a promising way for building trust through social control incollaborative communities by harnessing the community knowledge in the form of feedback.However; reputation systems also introduce vulnerabilities due to potential manipulations bydishonest or malicious players. In this paper; we focus on two closely related problems-feedback sparsity and potential feedback manipulations-and propose a feedback similaritybased inference framework. We perform extensive evaluations of various algorithmiccomponents of the framework and evaluate their effectiveness on countering feedbacksparsity in the presence of feedback manipulations.,Collaborative Computing: Networking; Applications and Worksharing; 2007.

Dynamic query processing for p2p data services in the cloud,Pawel Jurczyk; Li Xiong,Abstract With the trend of cloud computing; data and computing are moved away fromdesktop and are instead provided as a service from the cloud. Data-as-a-service enablesaccess to a wealth of data across distributed and heterogeneous data sources in the cloud.We designed and developed DObjects; a general-purpose P2P-based query and dataoperations infrastructure that can be deployed in the cloud. This paper presents the detailsof the dynamic query execution engine within our data query infrastructure that dynamicallyadapts to network and node conditions. The query processing is capable of fully benefitingfrom all the distributed resources to minimize the query response time and maximize systemthroughput.

HIDE: heterogeneous information DE-identification,James Gardner; Li Xiong; Kanwei Li; James J Lu,Abstract While there is an increasing need to share data that may contain personalinformation; such data sharing must preserve individual privacy without disclosing anyidentifiable information. A considerable amount of research in the data privacy communityhas been devoted to formalizing the notion of identifiability with many techniques foranonymization; but is focused exclusively on structured data. On the other hand; efforts onde-identifying medical text documents in the medical informatics community are highlyspecialized for specific document types or a subset of identifiers. In addition; they rely onsimple identifier removal or grouping techniques and do not take advantage of the researchdevelopments in the data privacy community. We developed an integrated system; HIDE; forHeterogeneous Information DE-identification including structured and unstructured data …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,16
Towards privacy-preserving integration of distributed heterogeneous data,Pawel Jurczyk; Li Xiong,Abstract More and more applications rely heavily on large amounts of data in the distributedstorages collected over time or produced by large scale scientific experiments orsimulations. An important fact is that many organizations collect; store; and use various typesof information about individuals. In consequence; such data sharing is subject to constraintsimposed by privacy of individuals or data subjects as well as data confidentiality ofinstitutions or data providers. Given a query spanning multiple databases; it should beexecuted transparently and efficiently. And most importantly; the results should not containindividually identifiable information and institutions should not reveal their databases toeach other apart from the query results. In this paper; we propose a distributedanonymization protocol that allows independent data providers to build a virtual …,Proceedings of the 2nd PhD workshop on Information and knowledge management,2008,16
DObjects: Enabling distributed data services for metacomputing platforms,Pawel Jurczyk; Li Xiong; Vaidy Sunderam,Abstract Many applications rely heavily on large amounts of data in the distributed storagescollected over time or produced by large scale scientific experiments or simulations. The keyconstraints for building a distributed data query infrastructure for such applications are:scalability; consistency; heterogeneity and network and resource dynamics. We designedand developed DObjects; a general-purpose query and data operations infrastructure thatcan be integrated with metacomputing middleware. This paper describes the architecture ofour data services and shows how those services were integrated with the metacomputingframework offering users an open platform for building distributed applications that requireaccess to data integrated from multiple distributed data sources.,International Conference on Computational Science,2008,16
Participant privacy in mobile crowd sensing task management: A survey of methods and challenges,Layla Pournajaf; Daniel A Garcia-Ulloa; Li Xiong; Vaidy Sunderam,Abstract Mobile crowd sensing enables a broad range of novel applications by leveragingmobile devices and smartphone users worldwide. While this paradigm is immensely useful;it involves the collection of detailed information from sensors and their carriers (ieparticipants) during task management processes including participant recruitment and taskdistribution. Such information might compromise participant privacy in various regards byidentification or disclosure of sensitive attributes--thereby increasing vulnerability andsubsequently reducing participation. In this survey; we identify different task managementapproaches in mobile crowd sensing; and assess the threats to participant privacy whenpersonal information is disclosed. We also outline how privacy mechanisms are utilized inexisting sensing applications to protect the participants against these threats. Finally; we …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2016,15
An evaluation of feature sets and sampling techniques for de-identification of medical records,James Gardner; Li Xiong; Fusheng Wang; Andrew Post; Joel Saltz; Tyrone Grandison,Abstract De-identification of text medical records is of critical importance in any healthinformatics system in order to facilitate research and sharing of medical records. Whilestatistical learning based techniques have shown promising results for de-identificationpurposes; few such systems are publicly available. It remains a challenge for practitioners tobuild an accurate and efficient system as it involves a significant amount of featureengineering; ie creation and examination of new features used in the system. Acomprehensive evaluation is needed to thoroughly understand the effects of different featuresets and potential impacts of sampling and their trade-offs between the often conflictinggoals of precision (or positive predictive value); recall (or sensitivity); and efficiency.

In loose terms; the fair exchange problem is defined asatomically exchanging electronic items between two parties. All the known fair exchangeprotocols today utilize a centralized trusted third party server either actively or passively. Inthis paper; we propose a distributed protocol for exchange of electronic items usinguntrusted servers. We perform detailed security analysis and show that the protocolguarantees effectiveness and fairness with Byzantine failures of up to one third of theuntrusted servers. We also give the probability of a fair exchange otherwise.

Privacy-preserving inference of social relationships from location data: a vision paper,Cyrus Shahabi; Liyue Fan; Luciano Nocera; Li Xiong; Ming Li,Abstract Social relationships between people; eg; whether they are friends with each other;can be inferred by observing their behaviors in the real world. Thanks to the popularity ofGPS-enabled mobile devices or online services; a large amount of high-resolution locationdata becomes available for such inference studies. However; due to the sensitivity oflocation data and user privacy concerns; those studies cannot be largely carried out onindividually contributed data without privacy guarantees. Furthermore; we observe that theactual location may not be needed for social relationship studies; but rather the fact that twopeople met and some statistical properties about their meeting locations; which can becomputed in a private manner. In this paper; we envision an extensible framework; dubbedPrivacy-preserving Location Analytics and Computation Environment (PLACE); which …,Proceedings of the 23rd SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2015,13
Automatic link detection: a sequence labeling approach,James J Gardner; Li Xiong,Abstract The popularity of Wikipedia and other online knowledge bases has recentlyproduced an interest in the machine learning community for the problem of automaticlinking. Automatic hyperlinking can be viewed as two sub problems-link detection whichdetermines the source of a link; and link disambiguation which determines the destination ofa link. Wikipedia is a rich corpus with hyperlink data provided by authors. It is possible to usethis data to train classifiers to be able to mimic the authors in some capacity. In this paper;we introduce automatic link detection as a sequence labeling problem. Conditional randomfields (CRFs) are a probabilistic framework for labeling sequential data. We show thattraining a CRF with different types of features from the Wikipedia dataset can be used toautomatically detect links with almost perfect precision and high recall.,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,13

Frequency modeling of wind power fluctuation and the application on power systems,Jin Lin; Yuan-zhang Sun; Poul Sørensen; Guo-jie Li; Xiong Li,System imbalance due to power fluctuation is the first concern of power grid with large scalewind power integration. Traditional studies are limited in time domain; where the modeling isnot convenient enough. In this paper; a model based on frequency domain is proposed. Thismodel is more precise; and capable to take some important factors; such as the layout ofwind farm; into account. This paper also presents a fast engineering implementation of thismodel; which can be applied on different power system studies. The case studies show thismodel can perfectly evaluate the ramp rate and reserve requirement of power systems; nomatter under normal or extreme weather condition; therefore the validity and flexibility of thismodel get proved.,Power System Technology (POWERCON); 2010 International Conference on,2010,12
Differentially private frequent sequence mining via sampling-based candidate pruning,Shengzhi Xu; Sen Su; Xiang Cheng; Zhengyi Li; Li Xiong,In this paper; we study the problem of mining frequent sequences under the rigorousdifferential privacy model. We explore the possibility of designing a differentially privatefrequent sequence mining (FSM) algorithm which can achieve both high data utility and ahigh degree of privacy. We found; in differentially private FSM; the amount of required noiseis proportionate to the number of candidate sequences. If we could effectively reduce thenumber of unpromising candidate sequences; the utility and privacy tradeoff can besignificantly improved. To this end; by leveraging a sampling-based candidate pruningtechnique; we propose a novel differentially private FSM algorithm; which is referred to asPFS 2. The core of our algorithm is to utilize sample databases to further prune thecandidate sequences generated based on the downward closure property.

DPSynthesizer: differentially private data synthesizer for privacy preserving data sharing,Haoran Li; Li Xiong; Lifan Zhang; Xiaoqian Jiang,Abstract Differential privacy has recently emerged in private statistical data release as one ofthe strongest privacy guarantees. Releasing synthetic data that mimic original data withdifferential privacy provides a promising way for privacy preserving data sharing andanalytics while providing a rigorous privacy guarantee. However; to this date there is noopen-source tools that allow users to generate differentially private synthetic data; inparticular; for high dimensional and large domain data. Most of the existing techniques thatgenerate differentially private histograms or synthetic data only work well for singledimensional or low-dimensional histograms. They become problematic for high dimensionaland large domain data due to increased perturbation error and computation complexity.

Adaptively sharing time-series with differential privacy,Liyue Fan; Li Xiong,Abstract: Sharing real-time aggregate statistics of private data is of great value to the publicto perform data mining for understanding important phenomena; such as Influenzaoutbreaks and traffic congestion. However; releasing time-series data with standarddifferential privacy mechanism has limited utility due to high correlation between datavalues. We propose FAST; a novel framework to release real-time aggregate statistics underdifferential privacy based on filtering and adaptive sampling. To minimize the overall privacycost; FAST adaptively samples long time-series according to the detected data dynamics. Toimprove the accuracy of data release per time stamp; FAST predicts data values at non-sampling points and corrects noisy observations at sampling points. Our experiments withreal-world as well as synthetic data sets confirm that FAST improves the accuracy of …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1202.3461,2012,11
Mining frequent patterns with differential privacy,Luca Bonomi; Li Xiong,Abstract The mining of frequent patterns is a fundamental component in many data miningtasks. A considerable amount of research on this problem has led to a wide series of efficientand scalable algorithms for mining frequent patterns. However; releasing these patterns isposing concerns on the privacy of the users participating in the data. Indeed the informationfrom the patterns can be linked with a large amount of data available from other sourcescreating opportunities for adversaries to break the individual privacy of the users anddisclose sensitive information. In this proposal; we study the mining of frequent patterns in aprivacy preserving setting. We first investigate the difference between sequential and itemsetpatterns; and second we extend the definition of patterns by considering the absence andpresence of noise in the data. This leads us in distinguishing the patterns between exact …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,10

To achieve sufficient statistical power in a survival analysis; itusually requires a large amount of data. Data sharing across institutions could be a potentialworkaround for providing this added power.

Quantifying differential privacy under temporal correlations,Yang Cao; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Yonghui Xiao; Li Xiong,Differential Privacy (DP) has received increasing attention as a rigorous privacy framework.Many existing studies employ traditional DP mechanisms (eg; the Laplace mechanism) asprimitives; which assume that the data are independent; or that adversaries do not haveknowledge of the data correlations. However; continuous generated data in the real worldtend to be temporally correlated; and such correlations can be acquired by adversaries. Inthis paper; we investigate the potential privacy loss of a traditional DP mechanism undertemporal correlations in the context of continuous data release. First; we model the temporalcorrelations using Markov model and analyze the privacy leakage of a DP mechanism whenadversaries have knowledge of such temporal correlations. Our analysis reveals that theprivacy loss of a DP mechanism may accumulate and increase over time. We call it …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,8
Privacy preserving RBF kernel support vector machine,Haoran Li; Li Xiong; Lucila Ohno-Machado; Xiaoqian Jiang,Data sharing is challenging but important for healthcare research. Methods for privacy-preserving data dissemination based on the rigorous differential privacy standard have beendeveloped but they did not consider the characteristics of biomedical data and make full useof the available information. This often results in too much noise in the final outputs. Wehypothesized that this situation can be alleviated by leveraging a small portion of open-consented data to improve utility without sacrificing privacy. We developed a hybrid privacy-preserving differentially private support vector machine (SVM) model that uses public dataand private data together. Our model leverages the RBF kernel and can handle nonlinearlyseparable cases. Experiments showed that this approach outperforms two baselines:(1)SVMs that only use public data; and (2) differentially private SVMs that are built from …,BioMed research international,2014,8

It also creates an increasingchallenge for automatically and dynamically placing the data in the globally distributedcomputers or data centers in order to optimally utilize resources while minimizing user-perceived latency.

Towards application-oriented data anonymization,Li Xiong; Kumudhavalli Rangachari,Abstract Data anonymization is of increasing importance for allowing sharing of individualdata for a variety of data analysis and mining applications. Most of existing work on dataanonymization optimizes the anonymization in terms of data utility typically through one-size-fits-all measures such as data discernibility. Our primary viewpoint in this paper is that eachtarget application may have a unique need of the data and the best way of measuring datautility is based on the analysis task for which the anonymized data will ultimately be used.We take a top-down analysis of typical application scenarios and derive applicationorientedanonymization criteria. We propose a prioritized anonymization scheme where we prioritizethe attributes for anonymization based on how important and critical they are to theapplication needs. Finally; we present preliminary results that show the benefits of our …,First SIAM International Workshop on Practical Privacy-Preserving Data Mining; Atlanta; US,2008,8

Finding probabilistic k-skyline sets on uncertain data,Jinfei Liu; Haoyu Zhang; Li Xiong; Haoran Li; Jun Luo,Abstract Skyline is a set of points that are not dominated by any other point. Given uncertainobjects; probabilistic skyline has been studied which computes objects with high probabilityof being skyline. While useful for selecting individual objects; it is not sufficient for scenarioswhere we wish to compute a subset of skyline objects; ie; a skyline set. In this paper; wegeneralize the notion of probabilistic skyline to probabilistic k-skyline sets (Pk-SkylineSets)which computes k-object sets with high probability of being skyline set. We present anefficient algorithm for computing probabilistic k-skyline sets. It uses two heuristic pruningstrategies and a novel data structure based on the classic layered range tree to compute theskyline set probability for each instance set with a worst-case time bound. The experimentalresults on the real NBA dataset and the synthetic datasets show that Pk-SkylineSets is …,Proceedings of the 24th acm international on conference on information and knowledge management,2015,7
The non-catalytic N-terminal domain of ACS7 is involved in the post-translational regulation of this gene in Arabidopsis,Li Xiong; Dong Xiao; Xinxin Xu; Zhaoxia Guo; Ning Ning Wang,Abstract Post-transcriptional control of the expression of the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (ACS) gene family is important for maintaining appropriate levels ofethylene production. However; the molecular mechanism underlying the post-transcriptionalregulation of type 3 ACS proteins remains unclear. Multiple sequence alignment revealedthat the N-terminus of type 3 ACSs was longer than that of other ACSs. Fusing the N-terminal54 residues of ACS7; the sole type 3 ACS in Arabidopsis; to the β-glucuronidase (GUS)reporter significantly decreased the stability of N7 (1–54)–GUS fusion protein. Among these54 residues; residues 1–14 conferred this negative effect on the GUS fusion gene.Consistently; a truncated form of ACS7 lacking residues 1–14 was more stable than full-length ACS7 when transgenically expressed in Arabidopsis and led to a more severe …,Journal of experimental botany,2014,7
Differentially private anomaly detection with a case study on epidemic outbreak detection,Liyue Fan; Li Xiong,Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been studied in a variety of applicationdomains; ranging from syndrome surveillance for epidemic outbreaks to intrusion detectionin computer networks. The data collected from individual users contain sensitive information;such as health records and network usage data; and thus need to be transformed prior to therelease for privacy preservation. In this paper; we propose a novel framework for anomalydetection with differential privacy.

LinkIT: privacy preserving record linkage and integration via transformations,Luca Bonomi; Li Xiong; James J Lu,Abstract We propose to demonstrate an open-source tool; LinkIT; for privacy preservingrecord Linkage and Integration via data Transformations. LinkIT implements novelalgorithms that support data transformations for linking sensitive attributes; and is designedto work with our previously developed tool; FRIL (Fine-grained Record Integration andLinkage); to provide a complete record linkage solution.

Privacy preserving record linkage via grams projections,Luca Bonomi; Li Xiong; Rui Chen; Benjamin Fung,Abstract: Record linkage has been extensively used in various data mining applicationsinvolving sharing data. While the amount of available data is growing; the concern ofdisclosing sensitive information poses the problem of utility vs privacy. In this paper; westudy the problem of private record linkage via secure data transformations. In contrast to theexisting techniques in this area; we propose a novel approach that provides strong privacyguarantees under the formal framework of differential privacy. We develop an embeddingstrategy based on frequent variable length grams mined in a private way from the originaldata. We also introduce personalized threshold for matching individual records in theembedded space which achieves better linkage accuracy than the existing global thresholdapproach. Compared with the state-of-the-art secure matching schema; our approach …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1208.2773,2012,7
Mining multiple private databases using a privacy preserving knn classifier,Subramanyam Chitti; Li Xiong; Ling Liu,ABSTRACT Data mining technologies are popular for identifying interesting patterns andtrends in large amounts of data. With the advent of high speed networks and easily availablestorage; many organizations are able to collect large amounts of data. On one hand; theseorganizations would like to mine their data to understand and discover interesting patterns;on the other hand; many legal and commercial reasons may prevent the organizations fromsharing their data. In such situations; privacy preserving data mining tools become critical-they allow data from many organizations to be mined securely and with a minimum ofinformation disclosure. In this paper; we present a framework for mining multiple privatedatabases using a privacy preserving k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier. We develop ageneral model for privacy preserving kNN classification and present algorithms for …,*,2004,7
Information sharing across private databases: Secure union revisited,Pawel Jurczyk; Li Xiong,There is a growing demand for sharing information across multiple autonomous and privatedatabases. The problem is usually formulated as a secure multi-party computation problemin which a set of parties wish to jointly compute a function of their private inputs such that theparties learn only the result of the function but nothing else. In this paper we perform ananalysis and an experimental evaluation of existing and potential solutions for secure multi-party computation of union. We also present an alternative random shares based protocoland show that the protocol; although quite simple; is efficient while providing reasonablelevel of security that can be adjusted by users. We formally analyze the security propertiesand the cost of our protocol. We also experimentally compare the various existing andpotential solutions and show the tradeoff between different protocols in terms of security …,Privacy; Security; Risk and Trust (PASSAT) and 2011 IEEE Third Inernational Conference on Social Computing (SocialCom); 2011 IEEE Third International Conference on,2011,6
Hypoxia inducible factor 1α promotes endogenous adaptive response in rat model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion,Ying Yang; Jieyang Ju; Min Deng; Jing Wang; Hui Liu; Li Xiong; Junjian Zhang,Hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α); a pivotal regulator of gene expression in response tohypoxia and ischemia; is now considered to regulate both pro-survival and pro-deathresponses depending on the duration and severity of the stress. We previously showed thatchronic global cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) triggered long-lasting accumulation of HIF-1αprotein in the hippocampus of rats. However; the role of the stabilized HIF-1α in CCH isobscure. Here; we knock down endogenous HIF-1α to determine whether and how HIF-1αaffects the disease processes and phenotypes of CCH. Lentivirus expressing HIF-1α smallhairpin RNA was injected into the bilateral hippocampus and bilateral ventricles to knockdown HIF-1α gene expression in the hippocampus and other brain areas.

Privacy-Preserving IR 2016: Differential Privacy; Search; and Social Media,Hui Yang; Ian Soboroff; Li Xiong; Charles LA Clarke; Simson L Garfinkel,Abstract Due to lack of mature techniques in privacy-preserving information retrieval (IR);concerns about information privacy and security have become serious obstacles thatprevent valuable user data to be used in IR research such as studies on query logs; socialmedia; and medical record retrieval. In SIGIR 2014 and SIGIR 2015; we have run the privacy-preserving IR workshops exploring and understanding the privacy and security risks ininformation retrieval. This year; we continue the efforts of connecting the two disciplines of IRand privacy/security by organizing this workshop. We target on three themes; differentialprivacy and IR dataset release; privacy in search and browsing; and privacy in social media.The workshop includes panels with researchers from both fields on these three themes; aswell as invite industry speakers for real-world challenges.

Differentially private frequent subgraph mining,Shengzhi Xu; Sen Su; Li Xiong; Xiang Cheng; Ke Xiao,Mining frequent subgraphs from a collection of input graphs is an important topic in datamining research. However; if the input graphs contain sensitive information; releasingfrequent subgraphs may pose considerable threats to individual's privacy. In this paper; westudy the problem of frequent subgraph mining (FGM) under the rigorous differential privacymodel. We introduce a novel differentially private FGM algorithm; which is referred to asDFG. In this algorithm; we first privately identify frequent subgraphs from input graphs; andthen compute the noisy support of each identified frequent subgraph.

Database fragmentation with confidentiality constraints: A graph search approach,Xiaofeng Xu; Li Xiong; Jinfei Liu,Abstract Database fragmentation is a promising approach that can be used in combinationwith encryption to achieve secure data outsourcing which allows clients to securelyoutsource their data to remote untrusted server (s) while enabling query support using theoutsourced data. Given a set of confidentiality constraints; it vertically partitions the databaseinto fragments such that the set of attributes in each constraint do not appear together in anyone fragment. The optimal fragmentation problem is to find a fragmentation with minimumcost for query support. In this paper; we propose an efficient graph search based approachwhich obtains near optimal fragmentation. We model the fragmentation search space as agraph and propose efficient search algorithms on the graph. We present static and dynamicsearch strategies as well as a novel level-wise graph expansion technique which …,Proceedings of the 5th ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy,2015,5
Semantic Security: Privacy Definitions Revisited.,Jinfei Liu; Li Xiong; Jun Luo,Abstract. In this paper∗ we illustrate a privacy framework named Indistinguishable† Privacy.Indistinguishable privacy could be deemed as the formalization of the existing privacydefinitions in privacy preserving data publishing as well as secure multi-party computation.We introduce three representative privacy notions in the literature; Bayes-optimal privacy forprivacy preserving data publishing; differential privacy for statistical data release; andprivacy wrt semi-honest behavior in the secure multi-party computation setting; and provethey are equivalent. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first work that illustrates therelationships of these privacy definitions and unifies them through one framework.,Trans. Data Privacy,2013,5
Adapting commit protocols for large-scale and dynamic distributed applications,Pawel Jurczyk; Li Xiong,Abstract The continued advances in distributed data intensive applications have formed anincreasing demand for distributed commit protocols that are adaptive to large scale anddynamic nature of the applications to guarantee data consistency and integrity. Well knowntwo-phase commit protocol and three-phase commit protocol and their variants do notprovide scalability and flexibility desired for a wide range of applications with potentiallydifferent requirements on consistency and efficiency. In this paper; we present an adaptationof three-phase commit protocol for dynamic and scalable distributed systems. The protocol isnot only resistant to dynamic network and node failures but also provides good scalability.Most importantly; it offers a set of adjustable parameters for a desired level of consistency atlowest cost depending on specific requirements of different applications.,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2008,5

Differentially private distributed online learning,Chencheng Li; Pan Zhou; Li Xiong; Qian Wang; Ting Wang,In the big data era; the generation of data presents some new characteristics; including widedistribution; high velocity; high dimensionality and privacy concern. To address thesechallenges for big data analytics; we develop a privacy-preserving distributed onlinelearning framework on the data collected from distributed data sources. Specifically; eachnode (ie; data source) has the capacity of learning a model from its local dataset; andexchanges intermediate parameters with a random part of their own neighboring (logicallyconnected) nodes. Hence; the topology of the communications in our distributed computingframework is unfixed in practice. As online learning always performs on the sensitive data;we introduce the notion of differential privacy (DP) into our distributed online learningalgorithm (DOLA) to protect the data privacy during the learning; which prevents an …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2018,4
Safelog: Supporting Web Search and Mining by Differentially-Private Query Logs,Sicong Zhang; Grace Hui Yang; Lisa Singh; Li Xiong,Abstract Query logs can be very useful for advancing web search and web mining research.Since these web query logs contain private; possibly sensitive data; they need to beeffectively anonymized before they can be released for research use. Anonymization ofquery logs differs from that of structured data since they are generated based on naturallanguage and the vocabulary (domain) is infinite. This unstructured; unbounded data setposes different challenges for producing privacy-preserving query logs. To mitigate thesechallenges; we propose using a differential privacy framework called Safelog to generateanonymized query logs that contain sufficient contextual information to allow existing websearch and web mining algorithms to use the data and attain meaningful results. The key toachieving high privacy guarantees is the introduction of a query pool for augmenting the …,2016 AAAI Fall Symposium Series,2016,4
Stac: Spatial task assignment for crowd sensing with cloaked participant locations,Layla Pournajaf; Li Xiong; Vaidy Sunderam; Xiaofeng Xu,Abstract We propose to demonstrate STAC; a tool for spatial task assignment with cloakedlocations in crowd sensing applications. The need for systems such as STAC becomescritical when participants of crowd sensing applications hesitate to share their locations dueto privacy concerns. In such applications; STAC enables effective task assignmentcapabilities without compromising the location privacy of workers and volunteers. STACimplements novel algorithms that handle uncertain task assignment; which is a challengingproblem involving uncertain locations of participants as a result of location cloaking. We willdemonstrate; from both synthetic and real data; that our methods achieve high sensingcoverage with low cost using cloaked participant locations. We will also demonstrate alocation-based mobile Q&A application that utilizes STAC for task assignment.,Proceedings of the 23rd SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2015,4
Speed partitioning for indexing moving objects,Xiaofeng Xu; Li Xiong; Vaidy Sunderam; Jinfei Liu; Jun Luo,Abstract Indexing moving objects has been extensively studied in the past decades. Movingobjects; such as vehicles and mobile device users; usually exhibit some patterns on theirvelocities; which can be utilized for velocity-based partitioning to improve performance of theindexes. Existing velocity-based partitioning techniques rely on some kinds of heuristicsrather than analytically calculate the optimal solution. In this paper; we propose a novelspeed partitioning technique based on a formal analysis over speed values of the movingobjects. We first formulate the optimal speed partitioning problem based on search spaceexpansion analysis and then compute the optimal solution using dynamic programming. Wethen build the partitioned indexing system where queries are duplicated and processed ineach index partition.

While the specific definition of “smart city” is stillevolving; most agree that the term implies integrating communication and informationtechnology to advance quality of life. Location-aware mobiles apps can provide manyservices tailored to a user's current location. Several current apps provide routing andproximity alerts for hazards; but require users to disclose locations and dataowners/providers (DO) to advertise areas of interest locations.

Differential privacy and distributed online learning for wireless big data,Chencheng Li; Pan Zhou; Tao Jiang,Distributed sensor networks (DSN) have been widely applied in daily life. Many sensornetwork applications can be regarded as big-data optimization; since the sensor nodescollect large volume of data in a long time. However; subject to limited computation andcommunication capabilities of sensor nodes; how we process such a large scale of data is agreat challenge. In this paper; we give the sensor nodes the ability of online learning; whichreduces the size of data storage by “using” the data. Then; each sensor node is able to savemuch flash memory to handle more data. Furthermore; the communications among sensornodes may lead to privacy breaches. Hence; we use differential privacy to solve the privacy-preserving problem. Numeric results show the performance of our proposed differentiallyprivate distributed online learning algorithm used in DSN.,Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP); 2015 International Conference on,2015,3

Secure skyline queries on cloud platform,Jinfei Liu; Juncheng Yang; Li Xiong; Jian Pei,Outsourcing data and computation to cloud server provides a cost-e ective way to supportlarge scale data storage and query processing. However; due to security and privacyconcerns; sensitive data (eg; medical records) need to be protected from the cloud serverand other unauthorized users. One approach is to outsource encrypted data to the cloudserver and have the cloud server perform query processing on the encrypted data only. Itremains a challenging task to support various queries over encrypted data in a secure and ecient way such that the cloud server does not gain any knowledge about the data; query;and query result. In this paper; we study the problem of secure skyline queries overencrypted data.

We explore the possibility of designing a differentially privatefrequent sequence mining (FSM) algorithm which can achieve both high data utility and ahigh degree of privacy. We found; in differentially private FSM; the amount of required noiseis proportionate to the number of candidate sequences. If we could effectively prune thoseunpromising candidate sequences; the utility and privacy tradeoff can be significantlyimproved. To this end; by leveraging a sampling-based candidate pruning technique; wepropose PFS $^ 2$; a novel differentially private FSM algorithm. It is the first algorithm thatsupports the general gap-constrained FSM in the context of differential privacy.

Detection of distributed attacks in hybrid & public cloud networks,Syed Raheel Hassan; Julien Bourgeois; Vaidy Sunderam; Li Xiong,In this paper early detection of distributed attacks are discussed that are launched frommultiple sites of the hybrid & public cloud networks. A prototype of Cloud DistributedIntrusion Detection System (CDIDS) is discussed with some basic experiments. Thesummation of security alerts has been applied which helps to detect distributed attacks whilekeeping the false positive at the minimum. Using the summation of security alertsmechanism the attacks that have slow iteration rate are detected at an early stage.

Secure Distributed Data Anonymization and Integration with m-Privacy,Slawomir Goryczka; Li Xiong; BC Fung,Abstract—In this paper; we study the collaborative data publishing problem for anonymizinghorizontally partitioned data at multiple data providers. We consider a new type of “insiderattack” by colluding data providers who may use their own data records (a subset of theoverall data) to infer the data records contributed by other data providers. The paperaddresses this new threat; and makes several contributions.

A randomized response model for privacy-preserving data dissemination,Xiaoqian Jiang; Shuang Wang; Zhanglong Ji; Lucila Ohno-Machado; Li Xiong,Public dissemination of medical data encourages meaningful research and qualityimprovement. However; there is a big concern that improper disclosure may put sensitivepersonal information at risk. To maintain the research benefits and customize the privacyprotection; we propose a novel and practical randomized response model (k-shuffle) and astatistical information recovery procedure. The former mixes distribution of patient recordswith samples drawn from k-1 pre-determined distributions to ensure differential privacy. Thelatter allows data receivers to recover statistical properties (eg; the mean and variance) ofinterested sub-populations with accuracy proportional to the size of the sub-population. Thatis; our algorithm provides stronger privacy protection to smaller groups; and offers high datausability to studies targeted at larger population. Most importantly; with differential privacy …,Healthcare Informatics; Imaging and Systems Biology (HISB); 2012 IEEE Second International Conference on,2012,1

Information sharing across private databases: Secure union and intersection revisited,Pawel Jurczyk; Li Xiong,Abstract—There is a growing demand for sharing information across multiple autonomousand private databases. The problem is usually formulated as a secure multipartycomputation problem where a set of parties wish to jointly compute a function of their privateinputs such that the parties learn only the result of the function but nothing else. In this paperwe analyze existing and potential solutions for secure multiparty computation protocols forunion and intersection. We also present an alternative random shares based approach andshow that the protocols; although quite simple; are more efficient than existing protocolswhile providing reasonable level of security that can be adjusted by users. We formallyanalyze the security properties and the cost of our protocols. We also experimentallycompare the performance of our approach with the existing solutions.,*,2010,1

Architecture for Privacy-Preserving Integration and Querying of Distributed and Heterogeneous Data,Pawel Jurczyk; Li Xiong,ABSTRACT More and more applications rely heavily on large amounts of data in thedistributed storages collected over time or produced by large scale scientific experiments orsimulations. An important fact is that many organizations collect; store; and use various typesof information about individuals. In consequence; such data sharing is subject to constraintsimposed by privacy of individuals or data subjects as well as data confidentiality ofinstitutions or data providers. Given a query spanning multiple databases; query should notonly be executed efficiently by the system; but results should not contain individuallyidentifiable information. In addition; institutions should not reveal their databases to eachother apart from the query results. We propose a distributed anonymization protocol thatallows independent data providers to build a virtual anonymized databases; and a secure …,Proceedings of the Second Ph. D.

Adapting Distributed Commit Protocol for Dynamic Metacomputing Frameworks,Pawel Jurczyk; Li Xiong,Abstract With increasing interest in applications which benefit from distributed computingparadigm and require at the same time to operate on data from heterogeneous data sourcesthere is an increasing desire for commit protocols which can suit such systems. Well knowntwo-phase commit protocol and three-phase commit protocol or its modifications do notprovide flexibility which is desired for wide area of potential applications. In this paper wepresent an adaptation of three-phase commit protocol for dynamic distributed systems. Theprotocol is not only resistant to nodes/network failures; but also provides good scalability.Our protocol offers users a set of parameters which can be tuned and; depending on specificrequirements of the system; guarantee consistency at desired level for the best price.,*,2007,1

Now; some patients agree to open their information for research use;which gives rise to a new question of how to effectively use the public information to betterunderstand the private dataset without breaching privacy. In this paper; we specialize thisquestion as selecting an optimal subset of the public dataset for M-estimators in theframework of differential privacy (DP) in [1]. From a perspective of non-interactive learning;we first construct the weighted private density estimation from the hybrid datasets under DP.Along the same line as [2]; we analyze the accuracy of the DP M-estimators based on thehybrid datasets. Our main contributions are (i) we find that the bias-variance tradeoff in theperformance of our M-estimators can be characterized in the sample size of the released …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2018,*
A Two-Phase Algorithm for Differentially Private Frequent Subgraph Mining,Xiang Cheng; Sen Su; Shengzhi Xu; Li Xiong; Ke Xiao; Mingxing Zhao,Mining frequent subgraphs from a collection of input graphs is an important task forexploratory data analysis on graph data. However; if the input graphs contain sensitiveinformation; releasing discovered frequent subgraphs may pose considerable threats toindividual privacy. In this paper; we study the problem of frequent subgraph mining (FSM)under the rigorous differential privacy model. We present a two-phase differentially privateFSM algorithm; which is referred to as DFG. In DFG; frequent subgraphs are privatelyidentified in the first phase; and the noisy support of each identified frequent subgraph iscalculated in the second phase. In particular; to privately identity frequent subgraphs; wepropose a frequent subgraph identification approach; which can improve the accuracy ofdiscovered frequent subgraphs through candidate pruning.

Quantifying Differential Privacy in Continuous Data Release under Temporal Correlations,Yang Cao; Masatoshi Yoshikawa; Yonghui Xiao; Li Xiong,Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) has received increasing attention as a rigorous privacyframework. Many existing studies employ traditional DP mechanisms (eg; the Laplacemechanism) as primitives to continuously release private data for protecting privacy at eachtime point (ie; event-level privacy); which assume that the data at different time points areindependent; or that adversaries do not have knowledge of correlation between data.However; continuously generated data tend to be temporally correlated; and suchcorrelations can be acquired by adversaries. In this paper; we investigate the potentialprivacy loss of a traditional DP mechanism under temporal correlations. First; we analyze theprivacy leakage of a DP mechanism when adversaries have knowledge of such temporalcorrelations. Our analysis reveals that; the event-level privacy loss of a DP mechanism …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.11436,2017,*

Fast Algorithms for Pareto Optimal Group-based Skyline,Wenhui Yu; Zheng Qin; Jinfei Liu; Li Xiong; Xu Chen; Huidi Zhang,Abstract Skyline; aiming at finding a Pareto optimal subset of points in a multi-dimensionaldataset; has gained great interest due to its extensive use for multi-criteria analysis anddecision making. Skyline consists of all points that are not dominated by; or not worse thanother points. It is a candidate set of optimal solution; which depends on a specific evaluationcriterion for optimum. However; conventional skyline queries; which return individual points;are inadequate in group querying case since optimal combinations are required. To addressthis gap; we study the skyline computation in group case and propose fast methods to findthe group-based skyline (G-skyline); which contains Pareto optimal groups. For computingthe front k skyline layers; we lay out an efficient approach that does the search concurrentlyon each dimension and investigates each point in subspace.

Our methodincorporates a reliability model for users; which improves as more reports arrive whileincreasing the accuracy of the model in labeling the state of the event. The model is furtherimproved by Kalman estimation (BE+ KE) that models the spatio-temporal correlations of theevents and predicts the next state of an event and is corrected when new reports arrive.

Partitioning-based mechanisms under personalized differential privacy,Haoran Li; Li Xiong; Zhanglong Ji; Xiaoqian Jiang,Abstract Differential privacy has recently emerged in private statistical aggregate analysis asone of the strongest privacy guarantees. A limitation of the model is that it provides the sameprivacy protection for all individuals in the database. However; it is common that data ownersmay have different privacy preferences for their data. Consequently; a global differentialprivacy parameter may provide excessive privacy protection for some users; whileinsufficient for others. In this paper; we propose two partitioning-based mechanisms; privacy-aware and utility-based partitioning; to handle personalized differential privacy parametersfor each individual in a dataset while maximizing utility of the differentially privatecomputation. The privacy-aware partitioning is to minimize the privacy budget waste; whileutility-based partitioning is to maximize the utility for a given aggregate analysis.

Due to their inherent capability of simultaneously modeling the spatial andtemporal aspects of multiple instances; tensors have been successfully used to analyzesuch spatio-temporal data. However; standard tensor factorization approaches often result incomponents that are highly overlapping; which hinders the practitioner's ability to interpretthem without advanced domain knowledge.

Post-polymerization modification of styrene–maleic anhydride copolymer brushes,Wei Guo; Li Xiong; Cassandra M Reese; Douglas V Amato; Brittany J Thompson; Phillip K Logan; Derek L Patton,Post-polymerization modification (PPM) has been broadly employed to achieve functionalpolymer brush surfaces via immobilization of functional moieties on the brush using efficientorganic tranformations. Here; we demonstrate the amine-anhydride reaction as a modularPPM route to functional brush surfaces using poly (styrene–maleic anhydride)(pSMA)copolymer brushes as a platform. The amine-anhydride reaction on pSMA surfacesproceeds to high conversions; with rapid kinetics; under ambient reaction conditions; andexploits a readily available library of functional amines. Using cystamine as a modifier; aconvenient route to thiol-functionalized brushes was developed that enables sequentialPPM modifications with a large library of alkenes using both base-catalyzed thiol-Michaeland radical-mediated thiol–ene reactions.

A Markov chain based pruning method for predictive range queries,Xiaofeng Xu; Li Xiong; Vaidy Sunderam; Yonghui Xiao,Abstract Predictive range queries retrieve objects in a certain spatial region at a (future)prediction time. Processing predictive range queries on large moving object databases isexpensive. Thus effective pruning is important; especially for long-term predictive queriessince accurately predicting long-term future behaviors of moving objects is challenging andexpensive. In this work; we propose a pruning method that effectively reduces the candidateset for predictive range queries based on (high-order) Markov chain models learned fromhistorical trajectories. The key to our method is to devise compressed representations forsparse multi-dimensional matrices; and leverage efficient algorithms for matrixcomputations.

Specifically; we treat every state in Markov model as a node; anduse a graph to represent the privacy policy; in which" indistinguishability" between states isdenoted by edges between nodes. Due to the temporal correlations in Markov model; weshow that the graph may be reduced to a subgraph with disconnected nodes; which becomeunprotected and might be exposed.

Privacy Preserving Publication of Locations Based on Delaunay Triangulation,Jun Luo; Jinfei Liu; Li Xiong,Abstract The pervasive usage of LBS (Location Based Services) has caused serious risk ofpersonal privacy. In order to preserve the privacy of locations; only the anonymized orperturbated data are published. At the same time; the data mining results for the perturbateddata should keep as close as possible to the data mining results for the original data. In thispaper; we propose a novel perturbation method such that the Delaunay triangulation of theperturbated data is the same as that of the original data. Theoretically; the Delaunaytriangulation of point data set presents the neighborhood relationships of points. Many datamining algorithms strongly depend on the neighborhood relationships of points. Our methodis proved to be effective and efficient by performing several popular data mining algorithmssuch as KNN; K-means; DBSCAN.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2014,*
IFC soft: visual comparison of flow cytometry data using self-organizing maps,Kyle Thayer; Li Xiong; Vicki Hertzberg,Abstract Using flow cytometry (FCM) technology; multi-faceted measurements can be takenof many individual particles; and thus is often used in tissue sample analysis. As theresulting data set can have over ten dimensions and millions of points; analysis can becomplicated. Visualizing the data requires significantly reducing the number of dimensionsor condensing the volume of the data. In studies using FCM data from multiple patients atmultiple times; difficulties are compounded. We demonstrate IFC Soft; a program that usesSelf-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to visually analyze and compare FCM data. Taking pre-processed FCM data from a transplant study; we show how to use SOMs to select clusters ofcells and then to find trends among different classes of patients.,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM SIGHIT International Health Informatics Symposium,2012,*
RSK2 promotes head and neck cancer cell invasion through direct phosphorylation of Hsp27 to regulate actin filaments,Shannon Elf; Katherine Lythgoe; Taro Hitosugi; Jack Taunton; Wei Zhou; Li Xiong; Dongsheng Wang; Susan Muller; Songqing Fan; Shi-Yong Sun; Fadlo R Khuri; Jing Chen; Dong M Shin; Sumin Kang,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the most common types ofhuman cancers and frequently metastasizes to lymph nodes. We found that the proteinexpression pattern of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) correlates with the invasive abilityof diverse HNSCC cell lines; and with human head and neck cancer progression. ContinuedRSK2 expression is vital for maintenance of the invasive and metastatic potential of HNSCCcells in vitro and in vivo; respectively. In a phospho-antibody microarray-based study; weidentified pro-metastatic protein factors that are phosphorylated and activated by RSK2;including the previously identified CREB and a newly identified RSK2 substrate Hsp27;which are important for the RSK2-mediated pro-invasive ability of HNSCC cells. Hsp27 hasbeen found to be overexpressed in many types of cancers; and its overexpression is …,*,2010,*

Abstract# 4386: Phospho-proteomic analysis reveals the activation of ERK signaling by 2-deoxyglucose in NSCLC,Diansheng Zhong; Li Xiong; Tongrui Liu; Xiuju Liu; Jing Chen; Wei Zhou,Cancer cells display high rates of aerobic glycolysis in comparison to their nontransformedcounterparts (Warburg Effect). The inhibition of aerobic glycolysis is a valid cancertherapeutic target. 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) is metabolized to phosphorylated 2-DG (2-DG-P)which competitively inhibits hexokinase at the rate-limiting step of glycolysis; resulting in thedepletion of intracellular ATP; which ultimately leads to cell death in vitro. Currently; it isbeing evaluated in clinical trial for cancer treatment in combination with other therapies.Nonetheless; the implementation of 2-DG for cancer treatment has been a disappointment.Whereas 2-DG is toxic in vitro; xenografts studies indicated that 2-DG treatment does notenhance tumor cell killing as a single agent. Because 2-DG is a relatively small molecule;we sought to discover additional cellular targets of 2-DG in addition to glycolysis inhibition …,*,2009,*

Report on international workshop on privacy and anonymity in the information society (PAIS 2008),Li Xiong; Traian Marius Truta; Farshad Fotouhi,While the ever increasing computational power together with the huge amount of individualdata collected daily by various agencies is of great value for our society; they also pose asignificant threat to individual privacy. As a result legislators for many countries try toregulate the use and the disclosure of confidential information. Various privacy regulations(such as USA Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act; Canadian StandardAssociation Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information; Australian PrivacyAmendment Act 2000; etc.) have been enacted in many countries all over the world.

Frequent pattern mining for kernel trace data,Li Xiong,ABSTRACT Operating systems engineers have developed tracing tools that log detailsabout process execution at the kernel level. These tools make it easier to understand theactual execution that takes place on real systems. Unfortunately; uncovering certain types ofuseful information in kernel trace data is nearly impossible through manual inspection of atrace log. To detect interesting interprocess communication patterns and other recurringruntime execution patterns in operating system trace logs; we employ data miningtechniques; in particular; frequent pattern mining. We present a framework for mining kerneltrace data; making use of frequent pattern mining in conjunction with special considerationsfor the temporal characteristics of kernel trace data.

Bladder Dosimetry in High Dose Rate Vaginal Cuff Brachytherapy,AJ Stewart; RA Cormack; L Xiong; H Lee; JL Hansen; PM Devlin; AN Viswanathan,Purpose/Objective: The international standard of critical structure dose measurement; theICRU 38 reference bladder point; is limited by the fact that it is not representative of thevolume and surface area of normal tissue irradiated. Foley catheter placement is alsorequired for ICRU 38 delineation of bladder dose. Alternative; less invasive; methods ofbladder dose estimation are therefore valuable. The optimal state of bladder filling inpatients undergoing high dose rate (HDR) vaginal cuff brachytherapy has not been fullyanalyzed.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology• Biology• Physics,2005,*

Yet the calculation of the distribution is highly challengingdue to inter-fraction change in anatomic geometry. This work presents an algorithm fordeformable image registration of bladder and cumulative dose calculation in the setting ofHDR brachy-therapy for vaginal cylinder treatment. Method and Materials: CT scans wereobtained on 20 patients with gynecological cancer who received fractionated high dose ratebrachy-therapy to the vaginal cuff; with the vaginal cylinder in situ. As part of an IRBapproved study; the patients' bladder filling status was intentionally different for eachfraction. The bladder was manually contoured for each treatment fraction and its surface wasextracted for input to a biomechanical deformable registration algorithm; which models …,Medical Physics,2005,*
Homozygous deletion of MAHD4 in infiltrative ductal breast carcinomas,Diansheng Zhong; Aki Morikawa; Michael Guo; Cecile Colpaert; Li Xiong; Neil Lamb; Ceshi Chen; Jin-Tang Dong; Wei Zhou,1894 Genetic analysis of human tumors has significantly advanced our understanding of thecarcinogenic process. In primary tumors; however; the genetic analysis is fraught withtechnical problems; such as tissue contaminations; that have limited its reproducibility andinterpretation. Laser-capture microdissection (LCM) is currently the best method to isolaterelatively pure neoplastic cells from tissue specimens. This enrichment; nevertheless; itselfleads to difficulties; as it is associated with the procurement of a relatively low number ofDNA template molecules and consequently potential sampling errors. We here describe anovel experimental approach; involving two components; to ensure accurate homozygousdeletion analysis in primary tumors. First; quantitative real time PCR was coupled with the“counting alleles” method to quantify DNA recovery from LCM samples in molecular …,*,2005,*

COLL Ramanathan Nagarajan Sunday; March 16; 2014,Li Xiong,Surperamphiphobic surfaces; exhibiting high contact angles and low contact anglehysteresis to water and low surface tension liquids; have attracted a great deal attention inrecent years due to the importance in many practical applications. In this work; we present asimple strategy for fabrication of superamphiphobic coatings based on photopolymerizationof hybrid thiol-ene resins. Spray-deposition and UV cure of thiol-ene resins containinghydrophobic silica nanoparticles and fluorinated thiols provides a multiscale topography thatendows the surface with superamphiphobicity and repellency towards several low surfacetension liguids. Droplet impact and sandpaper abrasion tests indicate the coatingsrespectively possess a robust anti-wetting behavior and good mechanical durability.,*,*,*

A Selective Model to Suppress NLOS Signals in Angle-of-Arrival (AOA) Location,Li Xiong,ABSTRACT Angle-of-Arrival (AOA) is a key technique in wireless location estimation. Thestudy of AOA becomes very important with the recent FCC ruling regarding the wirelessEnhanced 911 (E911) emergency calling systems. This paper studies the performance ofAOA in cellular environment. Special attention is drawn to the Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS)problem that is a significant error source in position estimation. A model is proposed toidentify and to reduce the NLOS errors with the coordination of many base stations. Thesimulation results show that the proposed algorithm is quite efficient in reducing theestimation error when NLOS is present.,*,*,*

Queries across Multiple Private Databases,Li Xiong; Subramanyam Chitti; Ling Liu,Abstract Advances in distributed service-oriented computing and global communicationshave formed a strong technology push for large scale data integration among organizationsand enterprises. However; concerns about data privacy become increasingly important forlarge scale mission-critical data integration applications. Ideally; given a database queryspanning multiple private databases; we wish to compute the answer to the query withoutrevealing any additional information of each individual database apart from the query result.In practice; we may relax this constraint to allow efficient information integration whileminimizing the information disclosure. In this paper; we propose an efficient decentralizedpeer-to-peer protocol for supporting aggregate queries over multiple private databaseswhile respecting the privacy constraints of participants.

De-identification of Medical Text,Li Xiong; Konstantine Boronda; Michael Graiser; Christopher Flowers,Health informatics is receiving a tremendous amount of attention nationally and locally.While there is an increasing need to release and share health records for purposes such asdemographic and public health research and ultimately improve patient care; such datarelease and sharing must be governed by data privacy requirements. One of the biggestchallenges facing health informatics is allowing sharing and dissemination of medicalrecords while maintaining a commitment to patient privacy. Currently; investigators wishingto use medical records of research purposes have three options: obtain permission from thepatients; obtain a waiver of informed consent from their Institutional Review Boards (IRB) oruse a data set that has had all (de-identified data set) or most (limited data set) of theidentifiers removed.

Privacy-Aware Spatial Task Assignment For Coordinated Participatory Sensing,Layla Pournajaf; Li Xiong; Vaidy Sunderam; Slawomir Goryczka,ABSTRACT Participatory sensing is becoming a valuable paradigm; enabling a variety ofnovel applications built on mobile networks and smart devices. However; this trend bringsseveral challenges; including the need for software platforms to manage interactionsbetween participants and applications; with a number of constraints. One such criticalrequirement is participant privacy. In this paper; we examine the problem of privacy-preserving spatial task assignment in coordinated participatory sensing when theparticipants do not share their exact location due to privacy concerns. We investigatemethods for assigning participants to targets; efficiently managing location uncertainty andresource constraints. We formulate the problem as a two-stage optimization and proposegreedy algorithms to approximate each stage. Simulation results show that our methods …,*,*,*
