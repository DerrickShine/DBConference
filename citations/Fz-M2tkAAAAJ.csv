Grouping students in educational settings,Rakesh Agrawal; Behzad Golshan; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Given a class of large number of students; each exhibiting a different ability level;how can we group them into sections so that the overall gain for students is maximized? Thisquestion has been a topic of central concern and debate amongst social scientists andpolicy makers for a long time. We propose a framework for rigorously studying this question;taking a computational perspective. We present a formal definition of the grouping problemand investigate some of its variants. Such variants are determined by the desired number ofgroups as well as the definition of the gain for each student in the group. We focus on twonatural instantiations of the gain function and we show that for both of them the problem ofidentifying a single group of students that maximizes the gain among its members can besolved in polynomial time. The corresponding partitioning problem; where the goal is to …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,21
Profit-maximizing cluster hires,Behzad Golshan; Theodoros Lappas; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Team formation has been long recognized as a natural way to acquire a diversepool of useful skills; by combining experts with complementary talents. This allowsorganizations to effectively complete beneficial projects from different domains; while alsohelping individual experts position themselves and succeed in highly competitive jobmarkets. Here; we assume a collection of projects ensuremath {P}; where each projectrequires a certain set of skills; and yields a different benefit upon completion. We are furtherpresented with a pool of experts ensuremath {X}; where each expert has his own skillset andcompensation demands. Then; we study the problem of hiring a cluster of experts T⊆ X; sothat the overall compensation (cost) does not exceed a given budget B; and the total benefitof the projects that this team can collectively cover is maximized. We refer to this as the …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,17
Whither social networks for web search?,Rakesh Agrawal; Behzad Golshan; Evangelos Papalexakis,Abstract Access to diverse perspectives nurtures an informed citizenry. Google and Binghave emerged as the duopoly that largely arbitrates which English language documents areseen by web searchers. A recent study shows that there is now a large overlap in the toporganic search results produced by them. Thus; citizens may no longer be able to gaindifferent perspectives by using different search engines. We present the results of ourempirical study that indicates that by mining Twitter data one can obtain search results thatare quite distinct from those produced by Google and Bing. Additionally; our user studyfound that these results were quite informative. The gauntlet is now on search engines to testwhether our findings hold in their infrastructure for different social networks and whetherenabling diversity has sufficient business imperative for them.,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,15
A study of distinctiveness in web results of two search engines,Rakesh Agrawal; Behzad Golshan; Evangelos Papalexakis,Abstract Google and Bing have emerged as the diarchy that arbitrates what documents areseen by Web searchers; particularly those desiring English language documents. We seekto study how distinctive are the top results presented to the users by the two search engines.A recent eye-tracking has shown that the web searchers decide whether to look at adocument primarily based on the snippet and secondarily on the title of the document on theweb search result page; and rarely based on the URL of the document. Given that thesnippet and title generated by different search engines for the same document are oftensyntactically different; we first develop tools appropriate for conducting this study. Ourempirical evaluation using these tools shows a surprising agreement in the results producedby the two engines for a wide variety of queries used in our study. Thus; this study raises …,Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web,2015,12
Forming beneficial teams of students in massive online classes,Rakesh Agrawal; Behzad Golshan; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Given a class of large number of students; each exhibiting a different ability level;how can we form teams of students so that the expected performance of team membersimproves due to team participation? We take a computational perspective and formallydefine two versions of such team-formation problem: the MAXTEAM and theMAXPARTITION problems. The first asks for the identification of a single team of studentsthat improves the performance of most of the participating team members. The second asksfor a partitioning of students into non-overlapping teams that also maximizes the benefit ofthe participating students. We show that the first problem can be solved optimally inpolynomial time; while the second is NP-complete. For the MAXPARTITION problem; wealso design an efficient approximate algorithm for solving it. Our experiments with …,Proceedings of the first ACM conference on Learning@ scale conference,2014,12
Sofia search: a tool for automating related-work search,Behzad Golshan; Theodoros Lappas; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract When working on a new project; researchers need to devote a significant amount oftime and effort to surveying the relevant literature. This is required in order to gain expertise;evaluate the significance of their work and gain useful insights about a particular scientificdomain. While necessary; relevant-work search is also a time-consuming and arduousprocess; requiring the continuous participation of the user. In this work; we introduce SofiaSearch; a tool that fully automates the search and retrieval of the literature related to a topic.Given a seed of papers submitted by the user; Sofia Search searches the Web for candidaterelated papers; evaluates their relevance to the seed and downloads them for the user. Thetool also provides modules for the evaluation and ranking of authors and papers; in thecontext of the retrieved papers. In the demo; we will demonstrate the functionality of our …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,6
A framework for evaluating the smoothness of data-mining results,Gaurav Misra; Behzad Golshan; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract The data-mining literature is rich in problems that are formalized as combinatorial-optimization problems. An indicative example is the entity-selection formulation that hasbeen used to model the problem of selecting a subset of representative reviews from areview corpus [11; 22] or important nodes in a social network [10]. Existing combinatorialalgorithms for solving such entity-selection problems identify a set of entities (eg; reviews ornodes) as important. Here; we consider the following question: how do small or largechanges in the input dataset change the value or the structure of the such reportedsolutions? We answer this question by developing a general framework for evaluating thesmoothness (ie; consistency) of the data-mining results obtained for the input dataset X. Wedo so by comparing these results with the results obtained for datasets that are within a …,Joint European conference on machine learning and knowledge discovery in databases,2012,5
Toward data-driven design of educational courses: A feasibility study,Rakesh Agrawal; Behzad Golshan; Evangelos Papalexakis,A study plan is the choice of concepts and the organization and sequencing of the conceptsto be covered in an educational course. While a good study plan is essential for the successof any course offering; the design of study plans currently remains largely a manual task. Wepresent a novel data-driven method; which given a list of concepts can automaticallypropose candidate plans to cover all the concepts. Our method uses Wikipedia as anexternal source of knowledge to both identify which concepts should be studied togetherand how students should move from one group of concepts to another. For our experimentalvalidation; we synthesize study plan for a course defined by a list of concept names fromhigh school physics. Our user study with domain experts finds that our method is able toproduce a study plan of high quality.,Journal of Educational Data Mining,2016,3

What do row and column marginals reveal about your dataset?,Behzad Golshan; John Byers; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Numerous datasets ranging from group memberships within social networks topurchase histories on e-commerce sites are represented by binary matrices. While this datais often either proprietary or sensitive; aggregated data; notably row and column marginals;is often viewed as much less sensitive; and may be furnished for analysis. Here; weinvestigate how these data can be exploited to make inferences about the underlying matrixH. Instead of assuming a generative model for H; we view the input marginals as constraintson the dataspace of possible realizations of H and compute the probability density functionof particular entries H (i; j) of interest. We do this; for all the cells of H simultaneously; withoutgenerating realizations but rather via implicitly sampling the datasets that satisfy the inputmarginals. The end result is an efficient algorithm with running time equal to the time …,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,2013,3
Data integration: After the teenage years,Behzad Golshan; Alon Halevy; George Mihaila; Wang-Chiew Tan,Abstract The field of data integration has expanded significantly over the years; fromproviding a uniform query and update interface to structured databases within an enterpriseto the ability to search; ex-change; and even update; structured or unstructured data that arewithin or external to the enterprise. This paper describes the evolution in the landscape ofdata integration since the work on rewriting queries using views in the mid-1990's. Inaddition; we describe two important challenges for the field going forward. The firstchallenge is to develop good open-source tools for different components of data integrationpipelines. The second challenge is to provide practitioners with viable solutions for the long-standing problem of systematically combining structured and unstructured data.,Proceedings of the 36th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems,2017,2

Finding low-tension communities,Esther Galbrun; Behzad Golshan; Aristides Gionis; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Motivated by applications that arise in online social media and collaborationnetworks; there has been a lot of work on community-search. In this class of problems; thegoal is to find a subgraph that satisfies a certain connectivity requirement and contains agiven collection of seed nodes. In this paper; we extend the community-search problem byassociating each individual with a profile. The profile is a numeric score that quantifies theposition of an individual with respect to a topic. We adopt a model where each individualstarts with a latent profile and arrives to a conformed profile through a dynamic conformationprocess; which takes into account the individual's social interaction and the tendency toconform with one's social environment. In this framework; social tension arises from thedifferences between the conformed profiles of neighboring individuals as well as from the …,*,2017,1

Unveiling Variables in Systems of Linear Equations,Behzad Golshan; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract Motivated by emerging applications including vehicular traffic networks andcrowdsourcing systems; we introduce the Unveil problem defined as follows: given a systemof linear equations with less equations than unknowns (ie; an underdetermined system);identify a set of k variables to query their values so that the number of variables that can beuniquely deduced in the new system is maximized. In this paper; we study the complexity ofthe Unveil problem and several of its variants and we obtain the following results. In Unveil;when the variables of the linear system take real values; then the problem is NP-hard tosolve or even approximate. These inapproximability results carry over to the case where thequeries may involve linear combinations of variables. When the variables in the linearequations are binary; then the corresponding binary version of the UNVEIL problem …,*,2014,1

Minimizing Tension in Teams,Behzad Golshan; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract In large organizations (eg; companies; universities; etc.) individual experts withdifferent work habits are asked to work together in order to complete projects or tasks.Oftentimes; the differences in the inherent work habits of these experts causes tensionamong them; which can prove detrimental for the organization's performance andfunctioning. The question we consider in this paper is the following:" can this tension bereduced by providing incentives to individuals to change their work habits?" We formalizethis question in the definition of the k-AlterHabit problem. To the best of our knowledge weare the first to define this problem and analyze its properties. Although we show that k-AlterHabit is NP-hard; we devise polynomial-time algorithms for solving it in practice. Ouralgorithms are based on interesting connections that we draw between our problem and …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,*

Computational approaches for engineering effective teams,Behzad Golshan,Abstract The performance of a team depends not only on the abilities of its individualmembers; but also on how these members interact with each other. Inspired by this premiseand motivated by a large number of applications in educational; industrial and managementsettings; this thesis studies a family of problems; known as team-formation problems; thataim to engineer teams that are effective and successful. The major challenge in this family ofproblems is dealing with the complexity of the human team participants. Specifically; eachindividual has his own objectives; demands; and constraints that might be in contrast withthe desired team objective. Furthermore; different collaboration models lead to differentinstances of team-formation problems. In this thesis; we introduce several such models anddescribe techniques and efficient algorithms for various instantiations of the team …,*,2016,*
