Extended finite element method with edge-based strain smoothing (ESm-XFEM) for linear elastic crack growth,L Chen; T Rabczuk; Stephane Pierre Alain Bordas; GR Liu; KY Zeng; Pierre Kerfriden,Abstract This paper presents a strain smoothing procedure for the extended finite elementmethod (XFEM). The resulting “edge-based” smoothed extended finite element method(ESm-XFEM) is tailored to linear elastic fracture mechanics and; in this context; to outperformthe standard XFEM. In the XFEM; the displacement-based approximation is enriched by theHeaviside and asymptotic crack tip functions using the framework of partition of unity. Thiseliminates the need for the mesh alignment with the crack and re-meshing; as the crackevolves. Edge-based smoothing (ES) relies on a generalized smoothing operation oversmoothing domains associated with edges of simplex meshes; and produces a softeningeffect leading to a close-to-exact stiffness;“super-convergence” and “ultra-accurate”solutions. The present method takes advantage of both the ES-FEM and the XFEM …,Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering,2012,114
A node-based smoothed extended finite element method (NS-XFEM) for fracture analysis,N Vu-Bac; H Nguyen-Xuan; L Chen; S Bordas; P Kerfriden; RN Simpson; GR Liu; T Rabczuk,Abstract: This paper aims to incorporate the node-based smoothed finite element method(NS-FEM) into the extended finite element method (XFEM) to form a novel numerical method(NS-XFEM) for analyzing fracture problems of 2D elasticity. NS-FEM uses the strainsmoothing technique over the smoothing domains associated with nodes to compute thesystem stiffness matrix; which leads to the line integrations using directly the shape functionvalues along the boundaries of the smoothing domains. As a result; we avoid integration ofthe stress singularity at the crack tip. It is not necessary to divide elements cut by crackswhen we replace interior integration by boundary integration; simplifying integration of thediscontinuous approximation. The key advantage of the NS-XFEM is that it provides moreaccurate solutions compared to the XFEM-T3 element. We will show for two numerical …,Computer Modeling in Engineering & Sciences(CMES),2011,80

It is; however; much more difficult to obtain theupper bound solutions for these problems. This paper aims to formulate a novel singularnode-based smoothed finite element method (NS-FEM) to obtain the upper bound solutionsfor fracture problems. In the present singular NS-FEM; the calculation of the system stiffnessmatrix is performed using the strain smoothing technique over the smoothing domains (SDs)associated with nodes; which leads to the line integrations using only the shape functionvalues along the boundaries of the SDs.

A phantom-node method with edge-based strain smoothing for linear elastic fracture mechanics,Nam Vu-Bac; Hung Nguyen-Xuan; Lei Chen; Chang-Kye Lee; Goangseup Zi; X Zhuang; Gui Rong Liu; Timon Rabczuk,This paper presents a novel numerical procedure based on the combination of an edge-based smoothed finite element (ES-FEM) with a phantom-node method for 2D linear elasticfracture mechanics. In the standard phantom-node method; the cracks are formulated byadding phantom nodes; and the cracked element is replaced by two new superimposedelements. This approach is quite simple to implement into existing explicit finite elementprograms. The shape functions associated with discontinuous elements are similar to thoseof the standard finite elements; which leads to certain simplification with implementing in theexisting codes. The phantom-node method allows modeling discontinuities at an arbitrarylocation in the mesh. The ES-FEM model owns a close-to-exact stiffness that is much softerthan lower-order finite element methods (FEM). Taking advantage of both the ES-FEM …,Journal of Applied Mathematics,2013,69

A phase-field model coupled with large elasto-plastic deformation: application to lithiated silicon electrodes,L Chen; F Fan; L Hong; J Chen; YZ Ji; SL Zhang; T Zhu; LQ Chen,Abstract A phase-field model; accounting for large elasto-plastic deformation; is developedto study the evolution of phase; morphology and stress in crystalline silicon (Si) electrodesupon lithium (Li) insertion. The Li concentration profiles and deformation geometries are co-evolved by solving a set of coupled phase-field and mechanics equations using the finiteelement method. The present phase-field model is validated in comparison with a non-linearconcentration-dependent diffusion model of lithiation in Si electrodes. It is shown that as thelithiation proceeds; the hoop stress changes from the initial compression to tension in thesurface layer of the Si electrode; which may explain the surface cracking observed inexperiments. The present phase-field model is generally applicable to high-capacityelectrode systems undergoing both phase change and large elasto-plastic deformation.,Journal of The Electrochemical Society,2014,37

In the formulation of singular ES-FEM; only the assumeddisplacement values (not the derivatives) on the boundaries of the smoothing domains areneeded. Thus; a layer of T5 crack-tip element is devised to construct “singular” shapefunctions via a simple point interpolation with a fractional order basis; without mappingprocedure. The effectiveness of the present singular ES-FEM is demonstrated by intensiveexamples for a wide range of degrees of anisotropy.,Engineering Fracture Mechanics,2011,36

A multi model approach is developed; wherein; a setof local auto regressive exogenous (ARX) models are first identified at different processoperating points; and are then combined to describe the complete dynamics of a nonlinearsystem. An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used for simultaneous identificationof local ARX models; and for computing the probability associated with each of the localARX models taking effect. A smoothing algorithm is used to estimate the distribution of thehidden scheduling variables in the EM algorithm. If the dynamics of the scheduling variablesare linear; Kalman smoother is used; whereas; if the dynamics are nonlinear; sequentialMonte-Carlo (SMC) method is used.

Explicit finite deformation analysis of isogeometric membranes,Lei Chen; Nhon Nguyen-Thanh; Hung Nguyen-Xuan; Timon Rabczuk; Stéphane Pierre Alain Bordas; Georges Limbert,Abstract NURBS-based isogeometric analysis was first extended to thin shell/membranestructures which allows for finite membrane stretching as well as large deflection andbending strain. The assumed non-linear kinematics employs the Kirchhoff–Love shell theoryto describe the mechanical behaviour of thin to ultra-thin structures. The displacement fieldsare interpolated from the displacements of control points only; and no rotational degrees offreedom are used at control points. Due to the high order C k (k≥ 1) continuity of NURBSshape functions the Kirchhoff–Love theory can be seamlessly implemented. An explicit timeintegration scheme is used to compute the transient response of membrane structures totime-domain excitations; and a dynamic relaxation method is employed to obtain steady-state solutions.

An edge-based smoothed XFEM for fracture in composite materials,Y Jiang; TE Tay; L Chen; XS Sun,Abstract In this work; an edge-based smoothed extended finite element method (ES-XFEM)is extended to fracture analysis in composite materials. This method; in which the edge-based smoothing technique is married with enrichment in XFEM; shows advantages of boththe extended finite element method (XFEM) and the edge-based smoothed finite elementmethod (ES-FEM). The crack tip enrichment functions are specially derived to represent thecharacteristic of the displacement field around the crack tip in composite materials. Due tothe strain smoothing; the necessity of integrating the singular derivatives of the crack tipenrichment functions is eliminated by transforming area integration into path integration;which is an obvious advantage compared with XFEM. Two examples are presented to testifythe accuracy and convergence rate of the ES-XFEM.,International Journal of Fracture,2013,20

It is evenmore important for high energy density electrodes such as Li metal anodes; which issubjected to large volumetric and interfacial variations due to Li deposition/stripping cyclesduring operation. Currently; there is a lack of understanding of the role of SEI/Li interfacesand their mechanical and electrochemical properties. In this paper; we present an interfacialstudy to evaluate the two major SEI components; LiF and Li 2 CO 3; based on densityfunctional theory (DFT) calculations. The calculated interfacial energy results show that theLi 2 CO 3/Li interface has higher interfacial mechanical strength. The density of states (DOS)and electrostatic potential results demonstrate that the LiF/Li interface has higher electron …,Journal of The Electrochemical Society,2016,19

Herephase-field and finite-element simulations were combined to study the dynamics of strain-mediated voltage-driven magnetic domain-wall motion in curved nanowires. Using a ring-shaped; rough-edged magnetic nanowire on top of a piezoelectric disk; we demonstrate afast voltage-driven magnetic domain-wall motion with average velocity up to 550 m/s; whichis comparable to current-driven wall velocity.

Design of asymmetric gear and accurate bending stress analysis using the ES-PIM with triangular mesh,S Wang; GR Liu; GY Zhang; L Chen,This paper proposes a novel design of an asymmetric gear that applies a larger pressureangle in the drive side and a standard pressure angle in the coast side via accurate stressanalysis using the edge-based smoothed point interpolation method with triangular mesh(ES-PIM-(T3)). An asymmetric rack cutter is first developed. Then; the governing equations ofthe tooth profiles cut by the rack cutter are derived. Finally; five sets of asymmetric gears withthe pressure angles of 20°/20°; 25°/20°; 30°/20°; 35°/20°; and 40°/20° are established toquantitatively check the stress distributions at the fillet of the drive side of these teeth. Thebest point for applying force in a static bending stress analysis and the best pressure anglein the drive side for a gear design are suggested.,International Journal of Computational Methods,2011,7
A computational and experimental investigation of three-dimensional micro-wedge indentation-induced interfacial delamination in a soft-film-on-hard-substrate system,L Chen; KB Yeap; CM She; GR Liu,Abstract A three-dimensional finite element (FEM) simulation was performed to study themechanics of micro-wedge indentation-induced interfacial delamination of a soft film from ahard substrate. In this simulation; a traction–separation law; with two major parameters:interfacial strength and interfacial energy; was used to characterize the failure behaviors ofthe interface. Cracking of film and residual stresses were not included. The initiation andgrowth of the interfacial delamination were investigated for a wide range of interfacialproperties. It was found that the interfacial strength influences the initiation of delaminationmore than does interfacial energy; while the interfacial energy is more effective to affect thepropagation of the delamination crack. The effects of the length of wedge indenter tip andthe thickness of film on the onset and growth of interfacial delamination were also …,Engineering Structures,2011,6
Extended finite element method coupled with face‐based strain smoothing technique for three‐dimensional fracture problems,Y Jiang; TE Tay; L Chen; YW Zhang,Summary In this work; the extended finite element method (XFEM) is for the first timecoupled with face-based strain-smoothing technique to solve three-dimensional fractureproblems. This proposed method; which is called face-based smoothed XFEM here; isexpected to combine both the advantages of XFEM and strain-smoothing technique. InXFEM; arbitrary crack geometry can be modeled and crack advance can be simulatedwithout remeshing. Strain-smoothing technique can eliminate the integration of singular termover the volume around the crack front; thanks to the transformation of volume integrationinto area integration. Special smoothing scheme is implemented in the crack front smoothingdomain. Three examples are presented to test the accuracy; efficiency; and convergencerate of the face-based smoothed XFEM. From the results; it is clear that smoothing …,International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering,2015,5

In this paper; a finite-element modeling strategy is applied to develop a generalunderstanding of the relationship between porosity; pore topology; and elastic modulus forthe porous OSG thin films. This relationship in combination with the experimental elasticmodulus data from nanoindentation (NI) studies is used to predict the pore structure ofvarious OSG films. In addition; positron annihilation spectroscopy measurements areperformed to determine the threshold porosity for the transition from nonoverlapping tooverlapping porous structure. A similar threshold value is determined based on the finite-element modeling and experimental NI data.,Journal of Materials Research,2013,5
Accurate bending strength analysis of the asymmetric gear using the novel ES-PIM with triangular mesh,S Wang; GR Liu; GY Zhang; L Chen,ABSTRACT This paper extends the edge-based smoothed point interpolation method (ES-PIM) to the bending strength analysis of asymmetric gear with complex outlines. Five sets ofasymmetric gears with the pressure angles of 20/20; 25/20; 30/20; 35/20; 40/20 aregenerated by a special designed rack cutter; respectively. Four key factors; eg accuracy;convergence; convergence rate and computational efficiency of the present ES-PIM arechecked in great detail on these five models; and distributions of bending stresses at thefillet of drive side are carefully investigated.

Surface Model Based Modeling and Simulation of Filling Process in Gas-Assisted Injection Molding,Jianhui Li; Lei Chen; Huamin Zhou; Dequn Li,Present gas-assisted injection molding simulations are all based on either a midplanemodel or a 3D model; in which second modeling is unavoidable for a midplane model; and a3D simulation needs a full-scale three-dimensional discretization of parts leading tounsustainable computing time and unstable numerical analysis. In this paper; surface modelbased modeling and numerical simulation of gas-assisted injection molding are proposed.By taking the influence of gas penetration on melt flow as boundary conditions of the melt-filling region; a hybrid control-volume finite element/finite-difference method (CV/FEM/FDM)similar to conventional injection molding simulation is employed.

S-FEM FOR FRACTURE PROBLEMS; THEORY; FORMULATION AND APPLICATION,Gui Rong Liu; Lei Chen; Ming Li,This paper briefs some of recent works on applications of the smoothed finite elementmethod (SFEM) to fracture problems. In the SFEM formulation for simulating the singularfiled near the crack-tip; it is known that one can directly enrich the filed by adding in properterms needed to simulate the singularity; which can be done in a number of ways (see theSFEM book). In this work a generalized technique called the" enriched linear PIM" forconstructing shape functions is used to formulate a special" five-node (T5) singular crack-tipelement" that can produce a proper order of stress singularity near the crack-tip. One layer ofT5 crack-tip singular elements are used in a basic mesh of linear elements leading to a verysimple model that can be crated automatically for complicated geometry. Because the SFEMuses weakened weak formulations; such a simple model does not require transition …,International Journal of Computational Methods,2014,4

Study of Co-continuous Phase and Rheological Behavior of ABS/PETG Composites [J],Jian-bin SONG; Wen-bin YANG; Li-hong CHEN; Fang-bin YU; Qiu-ning WU,The ABS/PETG composites were produced by melting method and the morphology andrheological behavior were analyzed by using SEM and rotating rheometer in detail. TheSEM results showed that ABS and PETG were immiscible; and could form a co-continuousphase when ABS content was from 50-60 wt%; which was also confirmed by rotatingrheometer. Elevating the shear rate could decrease the viscosity of ABS and ABS/PETGcomposites substantially; but it had a little effect on PETG. Compared the composites withhigh content of ABS (≥ 50%); the low content of ABS (≤ 50%) in ABS/PETG compositeshad higher storage modulus; loss modulus and complex viscosity; which indicated thatcomposites strength was higher and the toughness was poorer.,China Plastics Industry,2013,2

A two-dimensional scanning electron microscopy image-dependent model of porous electrodesthat accounts for the diffusion; DIS; and the size and shape polydispersity of electrodeparticles is developed. The effects of the size and shape polydispersity on concentrationprofiles; DIS evolution; and mechanical failure mechanisms are numerically discussed.Simulations show that small particles experienced less DIS than larger particles; primarilybecause of their reduced strain mismatch. In elliptical electrode particles; simple cracksappear at the endpoints of the major axis; while more complicated and severe cracks appearat the endpoints of the minor axis. Small particles with a spherical geometry are most …,Journal of Materials Science,2017,1

Development of Smoothed Numerical Methods for Fracture Analyses and Interfacial Toughness Characterization in Thin Film Systems,CHEN LEI,This thesis is to develop new numerical methods for fracture analyses; and to propose anovel approach to characterize the interfacial toughness in thin film systems. Firstly; a stainsmoothing technique is introduced to the collapsed quadratic singular elements and theextended finite element method to formulate two novel numerical methods for fractureanalyses in thin film systems:(1) the singular smoothed finite element method (sS-FEM); and(2) the smoothed extended finite element method (S-XFEM). Within the strain smoothing;domain integration is transformed into boundary integration; and the stiffness matrixcalculation requires only evaluating the shape functions values (and not the derivatives).Therefore; the singular terms of functions are no longer necessary to compute the stiffnessmatrix; in addition; the need to subdivide elements cut by cracks in the XFEM settings can …,*,2011,1
Microstructural effects on effective piezoelectric responses of textured PMN-PT ceramics,Chen Ming; Tiannan Yang; Kun Luan; Lei Chen; Liang Wang; Jiangtao Zeng; Yongxiang Li; Wenqing Zhang; Long-Qing Chen,Abstract The effective piezoelectric properties of [001] c fiber textured Pb (Mg 1/3 Nb 2/3) O 3-PbTiO 3 (PMN-PT) ceramics were studied by phase-field modeling. The effects ofmicrostructures such as texture; grain shape; grain boundaries; residual pores andheterogeneous growth templates were investigated. It was found that the degree of textureplays a dominant role in determining the properties. The pores; heterogeneous templatesand grain boundaries reduce the properties significantly at high degrees of texture with theeffect diminishing at decreasing degrees of texture. The presence of heterogeneoustemplates leads to a more significant reduction in the properties than pores although thepiezoelectric coefficients of pores are zero. The shape of grains has a weak effect at alldegrees of texture. By utilizing the experimentally measured microstructural parameters in …,Acta Materialia,2017,*
Stress induced by diffusion; curvature; and reversible electrochemical reaction in bilayer lithium-ion battery electrode plates,Liang Ji; Zhansheng Guo; Shiyu Du; Lei Chen,Abstract In this paper; a new reaction-diffusion model; coupling the reversibleelectrochemical reaction; Lithium (Li) diffusion; and bending; is proposed to investigate thecurvature; neutral axis movement; and stress in bilayer electrode. Bending curvature andstress; for the first time; are analytically and numerically investigated relate to both thediffusion and the reversible electrochemical reaction. The results reveal that the reversibleelectrochemical reaction retards the lithiation process; leading to the slowing down ofdiffusion process. Two neutral axes exist in the active plate due to a gradient of mechanicalproperties during lithiation. The reaction makes the stress turn to compressive-state at theside surface of active plate; and more violent reaction aggravates this compressive stressduring charging. Moreover; the reaction alleviates the compressive stress at interface …,International Journal of Mechanical Sciences,2017,*

PHASE-FIELD MODELLING OF THE MARTENSITIC TRANSFORMATION IN SHAPE MEMORYALLOY Au 30 Cu 25 Zn 45,SONG Pengcheng; LIU Wenbo; CHEN Lei; Zhigang YANG Chi ZHANG,Abstract Applications of shape memory alloys require them have the ability to undergo backand forth through the solid-to-solid martensitic phase transformations for many times withoutdegradation of properties (termed “reversibility”). Low hysteresis and small migration oftransformation temperature under cycling are the macroscopic manifestation of highreversibility. By the crystallographic theory of martensite; materials with certain crystallinesymmetry and geometric compatibility tend to form no-stressed transformation interface andhave exce-llent functional stability. In the theory; several conditions that corresponding toextremely low hysteresis are specified. Stronger compatibility conditions which lead to evenbetter reversibility have been theoretically proposed; those conditions are called “cofactorconditions”.
