Online outlier detection in sensor data using non-parametric models,Sharmila Subramaniam; Themis Palpanas; Dimitris Papadopoulos; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Sensor networks have recently found many popular applications in a number ofdifferent settings. Sensors at different locations can generate streaming data; which can beanalyzed in real-time to identify events of interest. In this paper; we propose a framework thatcomputes in a distributed fashion an approximation of multi-dimensional data distributions inorder to enable complex applications in resource-constrained sensor networks. We motivateour technique in the context of the problem of outlier detection. We demonstrate how ourframework can be extended in order to identify either distance-or density-based outliers in asingle pass over the data; and with limited memory requirements. Experiments with syntheticand real data show that our method is efficient and accurate; and compares favorably toother proposed techniques. We also demonstrate the applicability of our technique to …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,428
Survey on mining subjective data on the web,Mikalai Tsytsarau; Themis Palpanas,Abstract In the past years we have witnessed Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Miningbecoming increasingly popular topics in Information Retrieval and Web data analysis. Withthe rapid growth of the user-generated content represented in blogs; wikis and Web forums;such an analysis became a useful tool for mining the Web; since it allowed us to capturesentiments and opinions at a large scale. Opinion retrieval has established itself as animportant part of search engines. Ratings; opinion trends and representative opinions enrichthe search experience of users when combined with traditional document retrieval; byrevealing more insights about a subject. Opinion aggregation over product reviews can bevery useful for product marketing and positioning; exposing the customers' attitude towards aproduct and its features along different dimensions; such as time; geographical location …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2012,295
Indexing large human-motion databases,Eamonn Keogh; Themistoklis Palpanas; Victor B Zordan; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Marc Cardle,Abstract Data-driven animation has become the industry standard for computer games andmany animated movies and special effects. In particular; motion capture data recorded fromlive actors; is the most promising approach offered thus far for animating realistic humancharacters. However; the manipulation of such data for general use and re-use is not yet asolved problem. Many of the existing techniques dealing with editing motion rely on indexingfor annotation; segmentation; and re-ordering of the data. Euclidean distance isinappropriate for solving these indexing problems because of the inherent variability foundin human motion. The limitations of Euclidean distance stems from the fact that it is verysensitive to distortions in the time axis. A partial solution to this problem; Dynamic TimeWarping (DTW); aligns the time axis before calculating the Euclidean distance. However …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,256
Distributed deviation detection in sensor networks,Themistoklis Palpanas; Dimitris Papadopoulos; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Sensor networks have recently attracted much attention; because of their potentialapplications in a number of different settings. The sensors can be deployed in largenumbers in wide geographical areas; and can be used to monitor physical phenomena; or todetect certain events. An interesting problem which has not been adequately addressed sofar is that of distributed online deviation detection in streaming data. The identification ofdeviating values provides an efficient way to focus on the interesting events in the sensornetwork. In this work; we propose a technique for online deviation detection in streamingdata. We discuss how these techniques can operate efficiently in the distributed environmentof a sensor network; and discuss the tradeoffs that arise in this setting. Our techniquesprocess as much of the data as possible in a decentralized fashion; so as to avoid …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2003,190

Online amnesic approximation of streaming time series,Themistoklis Palpanas; Michail Vlachos; Eamonn Keogh; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Wagner Truppel,The past decade has seen a wealth of research on time series representations; because themanipulation; storage; and indexing of large volumes of raw time series data is impractical.The vast majority of research has concentrated on representations that are calculated inbatch mode and represent each value with approximately equal fidelity. However; theincreasing deployment of mobile devices and real time sensors has brought home the needfor representations that can be incrementally updated; and can approximate the data withfidelity proportional to its age. The latter property allows us to answer queries about therecent past with greater precision; since in many domains recent information is more usefulthan older information.

Ranked join indices,Panayiotis Tsaparas; Themistoklis Palpanas; Yannis Kotidis; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,A plethora of data sources contain data entities that could be ordered according to a varietyof attributes associated with the entities. Such orderings result effectively in a ranking of theentities according to the values in the attribute domain. Commonly; users correlate suchsources for query processing purposes through join operations. In query processing; it isdesirable to incorporate user preferences towards specific attributes or their values. A way toincorporate such preferences is by utilizing scoring functions that combine user preferencesand attribute values and return a numerical score for each tuple in the join result. Then; atarget query; which we refer to as top-k join query; seeks to identify the k tuples in the joinresult with the highest scores. We propose a novel technique; which we refer to as rankedjoin index; to efficiently answer top-k join queries for arbitrary; user specified; preferences …,Data Engineering; 2003.

iSAX 2.0: Indexing and mining one billion time series,Alessandro Camerra; Themis Palpanas; Jin Shieh; Eamonn Keogh,There is an increasingly pressing need; by several applications in diverse domains; fordeveloping techniques able to index and mine very large collections of time series.Examples of such applications come from astronomy; biology; the web; and other domains. Itis not unusual for these applications to involve numbers of time series in the order ofhundreds of millions to billions. However; all relevant techniques that have been proposedin the literature so far have not considered any data collections much larger than one-milliontime series. In this paper; we describe iSAX 2.0; a data structure designed for indexing andmining truly massive collections of time series.

Incremental maintenance for non-distributive aggregate functions,Themistoklis Palpanas; Richard Sidle; Roberta Cochrane; Hamid Pirahesh,Abstract Incremental view maintenance is a well-known topic that has been addressed in theliterature as well as implemented in database products. Yet; incremental refresh has beenstudied in depth only for a subset of the aggregate functions. In this paper we propose ageneral incremental maintenance mechanism that applies to all aggregate functions;including those that are not distributive over all operations. This class of functions is of greatinterest; and includes MIN/MAX; STDDEV; correlation; regression; XML constructor; anduser defined functions. We optimize the maintenance of such views in two ways. First; byonly recomputing the set of affected groups. Second; we extend the incrementalinfrastructure with work areas to support the maintenance of functions that are algebraic.

Frequent items in streaming data: An experimental evaluation of the state-of-the-art,Nishad Manerikar; Themis Palpanas,Abstract The problem of detecting frequent items in streaming data is relevant to manydifferent applications across many domains. Several algorithms; diverse in nature; havebeen proposed in the literature for the solution of the above problem. In this paper; wereview these algorithms; and we present the results of the first extensive comparativeexperimental study of the most prominent algorithms in the literature. The algorithms werecomprehensively tested using a common test framework on several real and syntheticdatasets. Their performance with respect to the different parameters (ie; parameters intrinsicto the algorithms; and data related parameters) was studied. We report the results; andinsights gained through these experiments.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2009,74
What does model-driven data acquisition really achieve in wireless sensor networks?,Usman Raza; Alessandro Camerra; Amy L Murphy; Themis Palpanas; Gian Pietro Picco,Model-driven data acquisition techniques aim at reducing the amount of data reported; andtherefore the energy consumed; in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). At each node; a modelpredicts the sampled data; when the latter deviate from the current model; a new model isgenerated and sent to the data sink. However; experiences in real-world deployments havenot been reported in the literature. Evaluation typically focuses solely on the quantity of datareports suppressed at source nodes: the interplay between data modeling and theunderlying network protocols is not analyzed. In contrast; this paper investigates in practicewhether i) model-driven data acquisition works in a real application; ii) the energy savings itenables in theory are still worthwhile once the network stack is taken into account.

Which are the most attended venues? What do visitors think aboutthem? How do they feel before; during and after the event? These are few of the questions acity-scale event manger would like to see answered in real-time.

Density-based projected clustering over high dimensional data streams,Irene Ntoutsi; Arthur Zimek; Themis Palpanas; Peer Kröger; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract Clustering of high dimensional data streams is an important problem in manyapplication domains; a prominent example being network monitoring. Several approacheshave been lately proposed for solving independently the different aspects of the problem.There exist methods for clustering over full dimensional streams and methods for findingclusters in subspaces of high dimensional static data. Yet only a few approaches have beenproposed so far which tackle both the stream and the high dimensionality aspects of theproblem simultaneously. In this work; we propose a new density-based projected clusteringalgorithm; HDDStream; for high dimensional data streams.

Exemplar queries: Give me an example of what you need,Davide Mottin; Matteo Lissandrini; Yannis Velegrakis; Themis Palpanas,Abstract Search engines are continuously employing advanced techniques that aim tocapture user intentions and provide results that go beyond the data that simply satisfy thequery conditions. Examples include the personalized results; related searches; similaritysearch; popular and relaxed queries. In this work we introduce a novel query paradigm thatconsiders a user query as an example of the data in which the user is interested. We callthese queries exemplar queries and claim that they can play an important role in dealingwith the information deluge. We provide a formal specification of the semantics of suchqueries and show that they are fundamentally different from notions like queries by example;approximate and related queries. We provide an implementation of these semantics forgraph-based data and present an exact solution with a number of optimizations that …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,59

In this survey paper we explore the problem of identifying andextracting interesting knowledge from large collections of data residing in data warehouses;by using data mining techniques. Such techniques have the ability to identify patterns andbuild succinct models to describe the data. These models can also be used to achievesummarization and approximation. We review the associated work in the OLAP; data mining;and approximate query answering literature.

A blocking framework for entity resolution in highly heterogeneous information spaces,George Papadakis; Ekaterini Ioannou; Themis Palpanas; Claudia Niederee; Wolfgang Nejdl,In the context of entity resolution (ER) in highly heterogeneous; noisy; user-generated entitycollections; practically all block building methods employ redundancy to achieve higheffectiveness. This practice; however; results in a high number of pairwise comparisons; witha negative impact on efficiency. Existing block processing strategies aim at discardingunnecessary comparisons at no cost in effectiveness. In this paper; we systemize blockingmethods for clean-clean ER (an inherently quadratic task) over highly heterogeneousinformation spaces (HHIS) through a novel framework that consists of two orthogonal layers:the effectiveness layer encompasses methods for building overlapping blocks with smalllikelihood of missed matches; the efficiency layer comprises a rich variety of techniques thatsignificantly restrict the required number of pairwise comparisons; having a controllable …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2013,56
Sindbad: a location-based social networking system,Mohamed Sarwat; Jie Bao; Ahmed Eldawy; Justin J Levandoski; Amr Magdy; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract This demo presents Sindbad; a location-based social networking system. Sindbadsupports three new services beyond traditional social networking services; namely; location-aware news feed; location-aware recommender; and location-aware ranking. These newservices not only consider social relevance for its users; but they also consider spatialrelevance. Since location-aware social networking systems have to deal with large numberof users; large number of messages; and user mobility; efficiency and scalability areimportant issues. To this end; Sindbad encapsulates its three main services inside the queryprocessing engine of PostgreSQL. Usage and internal functionality of Sindbad; implementedwith PostgreSQL and Google Maps API; are demonstrated through user (ie; web/phone) andsystem analyzer GUI interfaces; respectively.,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,52
Indexing for interactive exploration of big data series,Kostas Zoumpatianos; Stratos Idreos; Themis Palpanas,Abstract Numerous applications continuously produce big amounts of data series; and inseveral time critical scenarios analysts need to be able to query these data as soon as theybecome available; which is not currently possible with the state-of-the-art indexing methodsand for very large data series collections. In this paper; we present the first adaptive indexingmechanism; specifically tailored to solve the problem of indexing and querying very largedata series collections. The main idea is that instead of building the complete index over thecomplete data set up-front and querying only later; we interactively and adaptively buildparts of the index; only for the parts of the data on which the users pose queries. The neteffect is that instead of waiting for extended periods of time for the index creation; users canimmediately start exploring the data series.

Using datacube aggregates for approximate querying and deviation detection,Themis Palpanas; Nick Koudas; Alberto Mendelzon,Much research has been devoted to the efficient computation of relational aggregations and;specifically; the efficient execution of the datacube operation. In this paper; we consider theinverse problem; that of deriving (approximately) the original data from the aggregates. Wemotivate this problem in the context of two specific application areas; approximate queryanswering and data analysis. We propose a framework based on the notion of informationentropy that enables us to estimate the original values in a data set; given only aggregatedinformation about it. We then show how approximate queries on the data from which theaggregates were derived can be performed using our framework. We also describe analternate use of the proposed framework that enables us to identify values that deviate fromthe underlying data distribution; suitable for data mining purposes.

Meta-blocking: Taking entity resolutionto the next level,George Papadakis; Georgia Koutrika; Themis Palpanas; Wolfgang Nejdl,Entity Resolution is an inherently quadratic task that typically scales to large data collectionsthrough blocking. In the context of highly heterogeneous information spaces; blockingmethods rely on redundancy in order to ensure high effectiveness at the cost of lowerefficiency (ie; more comparisons). This effect is partially ameliorated by coarse-grained blockprocessing techniques that discard entire blocks either a-priori or during the resolutionprocess. In this paper; we introduce meta-blocking as a generic procedure that intervenesbetween the creation and the processing of blocks; transforming an initial set of blocks into anew one with substantially fewer comparisons and equally high effectiveness. In essence;meta-blocking aims at extracting the most similar pairs of entities by leveraging theinformation that is encapsulated in the block-to-entity relationships. To this end; it first …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,43

Beyond 100 million entities: large-scale blocking-based resolution for heterogeneous data,George Papadakis; Ekaterini Ioannou; Claudia Niederée; Themis Palpanas; Wolfgang Nejdl,Abstract A prerequisite for leveraging the vast amount of data available on the Web is EntityResolution; ie; the process of identifying and linking data that describe the same real-worldobjects. To make this inherently quadratic process applicable to large data sets; blocking istypically employed: entities (records) are grouped into clusters-the blocks-of matchingcandidates and only entities of the same block are compared. However; novel blockingtechniques are required for dealing with the noisy; heterogeneous; semi-structured; user-generateddata in the Web; as traditional blocking techniques are inapplicable due to theirreliance on schema information. The introduction of redundancy; improves the robustness ofblocking methods but comes at the price of additional computational cost.

Web prefetching using partial match prediction,Themistoklis Palpanas; Alberto Mendelzon,Abstract Web tra c is now one of the major components of Internet tra c. One of the maindirections of research in this area is to reduce the time latencies users experience whennavigating through Web sites.

This study investigates theuse of partial match prediction; a technique taken from the data compression literature; forprefetching in the Web. The main concern when employing prefetching is to predict as manyfuture requests as possible; while limiting the false predictions to a minimum. The simulationresults suggest that a high fraction of the predictions are accurate (eg; predicts 18%-23% ofthe requests with 90%-80% accuracy); so that additional network tra c is kept low …,*,1998,43
A probabilistic optimization framework for the empty-answer problem,Davide Mottin; Alice Marascu; Senjuti Basu Roy; Gautam Das; Themis Palpanas; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract We propose a principled optimization-based interactive query relaxation frameworkfor queries that return no answers. Given an initial query that returns an empty answer set;our framework dynamically computes and suggests alternative queries with less conditionsthan those the user has initially requested; in order to help the user arrive at a query with anon-empty answer; or at a query for which no matter how many additional conditions areignored; the answer will still be empty. Our proposed approach for suggesting queryrelaxations is driven by a novel probabilistic framework based on optimizing a wide varietyof application-dependent objective functions.

Practical data prediction for real-world wireless sensor networks,Usman Raza; Alessandro Camerra; Amy L Murphy; Themis Palpanas; Gian Pietro Picco,Data prediction is proposed in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to extend the systemlifetime by enabling the sink to determine the data sampled; within some accuracy bounds;with only minimal communication from source nodes. Several theoretical studies clearlydemonstrate the tremendous potential of this approach; able to suppress the vast majority ofdata reports at the source nodes. Nevertheless; the techniques employed are relativelycomplex; and their feasibility on resource-scarce WSN devices is often not ascertained.More generally; the literature lacks reports from real-world deployments; quantifying theoverall system-wide lifetime improvements determined by the interplay of data predictionwith the underlying network. These two aspects; feasibility and system-wide gains; are key indetermining the practical usefulness of data prediction in real-world WSN applications.

Eliminating the redundancy in blocking-based entity resolution methods,George Papadakis; Ekaterini Ioannou; Claudia Niederée; Themis Palpanas; Wolfgang Nejdl,Abstract Entity resolution is the task of identifying entities that refer to the same real-worldobject. It has important applications in the context of digital libraries; such as citationmatching and author disambiguation. Blocking is an established methodology for efficientlyaddressing this problem; it clusters similar entities together; and compares solely entitiesinside each cluster. In order to effectively deal with the current large; noisy andheterogeneous data collections; novel blocking methods that rely on redundancy have beenintroduced: they associate each entity with multiple blocks in order to increase recall; thusincreasing the computational cost; as well. In this paper; we introduce novel techniques thatremove the superfluous comparisons from any redundancy-based blocking method. Theyimprove the time-efficiency of the latter without any impact on the end result. We present …,Proceedings of the 11th annual international ACM/IEEE joint conference on Digital libraries,2011,35
TASM: Top-k approximate subtree matching,Nikolaus Augsten; Denilson Barbosa; Michael Böhlen; Themis Palpanas,We consider the Top-k Approximate Subtree Matching (TASM) problem: finding the k bestmatches of a small query tree; eg; a DBLP article with 15 nodes; in a large document tree;eg; DBLP with 26M nodes; using the canonical tree edit distance as a similarity measurebetween subtrees.

Towards a general entity representation model,Barbara Bazzanella; Themis Palpanas; Heiko Stoermer,One of the major problems that have emerged in the Se- mantic Web (SW) effort is the problemof uniquely identify- ing entities [3]. Entities play a major role for the SW since they representthe atomic objects of reference and reason- ing. Nevertheless; we currently face the problemof identi- fying and referencing these entities; since different users; or systems; assign differentidentifiers to the same real-world entities. Along with the problem of assigning global identi- fiersto entities in the semantic web also come the problems of managing these identifiers throughoutthe entire lifetime of the entities.

System and method for incrementally maintaining non-distributive aggregate functions in a relational database,*,A system for incrementally maintaining non-distributive aggregate functions in a relationaldatabase includes a data storage device in which a relational database is stored. Aprocessor communicates with the data storage device and includes a databasemaintenance module. The database maintenance module includes a program forincrementally maintaining non-distributive aggregate functions in a relational database. Themethod embodied in the program includes determining whether all functions in a relationaldatabase query are distributive. Based on this determination; a basic propagate phasegraph is selectively altered to yield a new propagate phase graph. Changes to an automaticsummary table are then applied thereto based on the new propagate phase graph.,*,2006,29
Scalable detection of sentiment-based contradictions,Mikalai Tsytsarau; Themis Palpanas; Kerstin Denecke,ABSTRACT The analysis of user opinions expressed on the Web is becoming increasinglyrelevant to a variety of applications. It allows us to track the evolution of opinions ordiscussions in the blogosphere; or perform product surveys. The aggregation of sentimentsand analysis of contradictions is another important application; which becomes effectivesince we are able to capture the diversity in sentiments on different topics with moreprecision and on a large scale. Though; there is still a need for a scalable way of sentimentaggregation with respect to the time dimension; which preserves enough information tocapture contradictions. In this paper; we are focusing on the problem of findingsentimentbased contradictions at a large scale. First; we define two types of contradictions;depending on the distributions of opposite sentiments over time. Second; we introduce a …,DiversiWeb; WWW,2011,28
Distributed real-time detection and tracking of homogeneous regions in sensor networks,Sharmila Subramaniam; Vana Kalogeraki; Themis Palpanas,In many applications we can deploy large number of sensors spanning wide geographicalareas; to monitor environmental phenomena. The analysis of the data collected by suchsensor network can help us to understand the field dynamics; and optimize the deploymentof other solutions. We define a group of sensors having similar underlying distribution over aperiod of time as a homogeneous region. In this paper we propose distributed algorithms todetect such regions; approximate their boundary with a piece-wise linear curve and track theboundary in real-time.

Top-k nearest neighbor search in uncertain data series,Michele Dallachiesa; Themis Palpanas; Ihab F Ilyas,Abstract Many real applications consume data that is intrinsically uncertain; noisy and error-prone. In this study; we investigate the problem of finding the top-k nearest neighbors inuncertain data series; which occur in several different domains. We formalize the top-knearest neighbor problem for uncertain data series; and describe a model for uncertain dataseries that captures both uncertainty and correlation. This distinguishes our approach fromprior work that compromises the accuracy of the model by assuming independence of thevalue distribution at neighboring time-stamps. We introduce the Holistic-PkNN algorithm;which uses novel metric bounds for uncertain series and an efficient refinement strategy toreduce the overall number of required probability estimates. We evaluate our proposalunder a variety of settings using a combination of synthetic and 45 real datasets from …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,27
Entropy based approximate querying and exploration of datacubes,Themistoklis Palpanas; Nick Koudas,Much research has been devoted to the efficient computation of relational aggregations andspecifically the efficient execution of the datacube operation. We consider the inverseproblem; that of deriving (approximately) the original data from the aggregates. We motivatethis problem in the context of two specific application areas; that of approximate queryanswering and data analysis. We propose a framework based on the notion of informationentropy that enables us to estimate the original values in a data set; given only aggregatedinformation about it. We also describe an alternate utility of the proposed framework; thatenables us to identify values that deviate from the underlying data distribution; suitable fordata mining purposes. Finally; we present a detailed performance study of the algorithmsusing both real and synthetic data; highlighting the benefits of our approach as well as the …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2001.

A conceptual model for a web-scale entity name system,Paolo Bouquet; Themis Palpanas; Heiko Stoermer; Massimiliano Vignolo,Abstract The problem of identity and reference is receiving increasing attention in the(semantic) web community and is emerging as one of the key features which distinguishtraditional knowledge representation from knowledge representation on the web withrespect to data interlinking and knowledge integration on a large scale. As part of thisdebate; the OKKAM project proposed the creation of an Entity Name System which providesrigid identifiers; named OKKAMid s; for any type of concrete and particular entities; and linksOKKAMid s to existing identifiers which have been created elsewhere for the same entity.The introduction of these identifiers raises some practical and conceptual concerns. In thispaper we address them by extending two proposed ontologies (IRE and IRW) toaccomodate the notion of OKKAMid; describe their formal properties; illustrate why they …,Asian Semantic Web Conference,2009,25
Efficiently discovering recent frequent items in data streams,Ferry Irawan Tantono; Nishad Manerikar; Themis Palpanas,Abstract The problem of frequent item discovery in streaming data has attracted a lot ofattention lately. While the above problem has been studied extensively; and severaltechniques have been proposed for its solution; these approaches treat all the values of thedata stream equally. Nevertheless; not all values are of equal importance. In severalsituations; we are interested more in the new values that have appeared in the stream;rather than in the older ones. In this paper; we address the problem of finding recentfrequent items in a data stream given a small bounded memory; and present novelalgorithms to this direction. We propose a basic algorithm that extends the functionality ofexisting approaches by monitoring item frequencies in recent windows. Subsequently; wepresent an improved version of the algorithm with significantly improved performance (in …,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2008,24

Parallel meta-blocking: Realizing scalable entity resolution over large; heterogeneous data,Vasilis Efthymiou; George Papadakis; George Papastefanatos; Kostas Stefanidis; Themis Palpanas,Entity resolution constitutes a crucial task for many applications; but has an inherentlyquadratic complexity. Typically; it scales to large volumes of data through blocking: similarentities are clustered into blocks so that it suffices to perform comparisons only within eachblock. Meta-blocking further increases efficiency by cleaning the overlapping blocks fromunnecessary comparisons. However; even Meta-blocking can be time-consuming: applyingit to blocks with 7.4 million entities and 2.21011 comparisons takes almost 8 days on amodern high-end server. In this paper; we parallelize Meta-blocking based on MapReduce.We propose a simple strategy that explicitly creates the core concept of Meta-blocking; theblocking graph. We then describe an advanced strategy that creates the blocking graphimplicitly; reducing the overhead of data exchange. We also introduce a load balancing …,Big Data (Big Data); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,21

An important observation is that the entityidentification problem lies at the core of many semantic web applications. In this paper; weexamine the special requirements of storage and management for entities; in the context ofan entity management system for the semantic web. We study the requirements with respectto creating and modifying these entities; as well as to managing their evolution over time.Finally; we propose a conceptual model for there presentation of entities; and discussrelated research directions.,Database and Expert Systems Application; 2008.

Updating a data warehouse schema based on changes in an observation model,*,A method; information processing system; and computer readable medium for modifying atleast one data warehouse schema based on detected changes in an associated observationmodel are disclosed. The method includes determining if at least one new observationmodel has been created. The method also includes determining if at least one existingobservation model is associated with the new observation model. In response to the existingobservation model being associated with the new observation model; at least one changedattribute is identified by comparing the new observation model and the existing observationmodel. A set of files associated with the existing observation model is updated to reflect thechanged attribute between the new observation model and the existing observation model.,*,2008,21
Comparative analysis of approximate blocking techniques for entity resolution,George Papadakis; Jonathan Svirsky; Avigdor Gal; Themis Palpanas,Abstract Entity Resolution is a core task for merging data collections. Due to its quadraticcomplexity; it typically scales to large volumes of data through blocking: similar entities areclustered into blocks and pair-wise comparisons are executed only between co-occurringentities; at the cost of some missed matches. There are numerous blocking methods; and theaim of this work is to offer a comprehensive empirical survey; extending the dimensions ofcomparison beyond what is commonly available in the literature. We consider 17 state-of-the-art blocking methods and use 6 popular real datasets to examine the robustness of theirinternal configurations and their relative balance between effectiveness and time efficiency.We also investigate their scalability over a corpus of 7 established synthetic datasets thatrange from 10;000 to 2 million entities.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,19

Data series management: The road to big sequence analytics,Themis Palpanas,Abstract Massive data series collections are becoming a reality for virtually every scientificand social domain; and have to be processed and analyzed; in order to extract usefulknowledge. Current data series management solutions are ad hoc; requiring hugeinvestments in time and effort; and duplication of effort across different teams. Systems likerelational databases; Column Stores; and Array Databases are not a suitable solution either;since none of these systems offers native support for data series. Our vision is to design anddevelop a generalpurpose Data Series Management System; able to copewith big dataseries; that is; very large and fast-changing collections of data series; which can beheterogeneous (ie; originate from disparate domains and thus exhibit very differentcharacteristics); and which can have uncertainty in their values (eg; due to inherent errors …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2015,16

RINSE: interactive data series exploration with ADS+,Kostas Zoumpatianos; Stratos Idreos; Themis Palpanas,Abstract Numerous applications continuously produce big amounts of data series; and inseveral time critical scenarios analysts need to be able to query these data as soon as theybecome available. An adaptive index data structure; ADS+; which is specifically tailored tosolve the problem of indexing and querying very large data series collections has beenrecently proposed as a solution to this problem. The main idea is that instead of building thecomplete index over the complete data set up-front and querying only later; we interactivelyand adaptively build parts of the index; only for the parts of the data on which the users posequeries. The net effect is that instead of waiting for extended periods of time for the indexcreation; users can immediately start exploring the data series.

Efficient top-k approximate subtree matching in small memory,Nikolaus Augsten; Denilson Barbosa; Michael Bohlen; Themis Palpanas,We consider the Top-k Approximate Subtree Matching (TASM) problem: finding the k bestmatches of a small query tree within a large document tree using the canonical tree editdistance as a similarity measure between subtrees. Evaluating the tree edit distance forlarge XML trees is difficult: the best known algorithms have cubic runtime and quadraticspace complexity; and; thus; do not scale. Our solution is TASM-postorder; a memory-efficient and scalable TASM algorithm. We prove an upper bound for the maximum subtreesize for which the tree edit distance needs to be evaluated. The upper bound depends onthe query and is independent of the document size and structure. A core problem is toefficiently prune subtrees that are above this size threshold. We develop an algorithm basedon the prefix ring buffer that allows us to prune all subtrees above the threshold in a …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,15
Scalable similarity matching in streaming time series,Alice Marascu; Suleiman A Khan; Themis Palpanas,Abstract Nowadays online monitoring of data streams is essential in many real lifeapplications; like sensor network monitoring; manufacturing process control; and videosurveillance. One major problem in this area is the online identification of streamingsequences similar to a predefined set of pattern-sequences. In this paper; we present anovel solution that extends the state of the art both in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.We propose the first online similarity matching algorithm based on Longest CommonSubSequence that is specifically designed to operate in a streaming context; and that caneffectively handle time scaling; as well as noisy data. In order to deal with high stream ratesand multiple streams; we extend the algorithm to operate on multilevel approximations of thestreaming data; therefore quickly pruning the search space.

Self-organizing energy aware clustering of nodes in sensor networks using relevant attributes,Marwan Hassani; Emmanuel Mller; Pascal Spaus; Adriola Faqolli; Themis Palpanas; Thomas Seidl,ABSTRACT Physical clustering of nodes in sensor networks aims at grouping togethersensor nodes according to some similarity criteria like neighborhood. Out of each group; oneselected node will be the group representative for forwarding the data collected by its group.This considerably reduces the total energy consumption; as only representatives need tocommunicate with distant data sink. In data mining; one is interested in constructing thesephysical clusters according to similar measurements of sensor nodes. Previous data miningapproaches for physical clustering concentrated on the similarity over all dimensions ofmeasurements. We propose ECLUN; an energy aware method for physical clustering ofsensor nodes based on both spatial and measurements similarities. Our approach uses anovel method for constructing physical clusters according to similarities over some …,Proc. of the Int. Wkshp. on Kowledge Discovery from Sensor Data (SensorKDD),2010,14
Parallel meta-blocking for scaling entity resolution over big heterogeneous data,Vasilis Efthymiou; George Papadakis; George Papastefanatos; Kostas Stefanidis; Themis Palpanas,Abstract Entity resolution constitutes a crucial task for many applications; but has aninherently quadratic complexity. In order to enable entity resolution to scale to large volumesof data; blocking is typically employed: it clusters similar entities into (overlapping) blocks sothat it suffices to perform comparisons only within each block. To further increase efficiency;Meta-blocking is being used to clean the overlapping blocks from unnecessarycomparisons; increasing precision by orders of magnitude at a small cost in recall. Despiteits high time efficiency though; using Meta-blocking in practice to solve entity resolutionproblem on very large datasets is still challenging: applying it to 7.4 million entities takes(almost) 8 full days on a modern high-end server. In this paper; we introduce scalablealgorithms for Meta-blocking; exploiting the MapReduce framework. Specifically; we …,Information Systems,2017,13
Searching with XQ: the exemplar query search engine,Davide Mottin; Matteo Lissandrini; Yannis Velegrakis; Themis Palpanas,Abstract We demonstrate XQ; a query engine that implements a novel technique forsearching relevant information on the web and in various data sources; called ExemplarQueries. While the traditional query model expects the user to provide a set of specificationsthat the elements of interest need to satisfy; XQ expects the user to provide only an elementof interest and we infer the desired answer set based on that element. Through the variousexamples we demonstrate the functionality of the system and its applicability in variouscases. At the same time; we highlight the technical challenges for this type of queryanswering and illustrate the implementation approach we have materialized.

Efficient sentiment correlation for large-scale demographics,Mikalai Tsytsarau; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Themis Palpanas,Abstract Analyzing sentiments of demographic groups is becoming important for the SocialWeb; where millions of users provide opinions on a wide variety of content. While severalapproaches exist for mining sentiments from product reviews or micro-blogs; little attentionhas been devoted to aggregating and comparing extracted sentiments for differentdemographic groups over time; such as' Students in Italy'or'Teenagers in Europe'. Thisproblem demands efficient and scalable methods for sentiment aggregation and correlation;which account for the evolution of sentiment values; sentiment bias; and other factorsassociated with the special characteristics of web data. We propose a scalable approach forsentiment indexing and aggregation that works on multiple time granularities and usesincrementally updateable data structures for online operation.

Content and type as orthogonal modeling features: a study on user interest awareness in entity subscription services,George Giannakopoulos; Themis Palpanas,Abstract—Real-word entities can be mapped to unique entity identifiers through an EntityName System (ENS); to systematically support the re-use of these identifiers anddisambiguate references to real world entities in the Web. An entity subscription serviceinforms subscribed users of changes in the descriptive data of an entity; which is a set of free-form attribute name-value pairs. We study the design; implementation and application of anadaptable; push-policy subscription service; within a large-scale ENS. The subscriptionsystem aims to deliver ranked descriptions of the changes on entities; following userpreferences through a feedbackdriven adaptation process. Within this paper; we offer anovel approach based on the discrimination between the content (descriptive aspect) andthe type (directly quantifiable or binary aspects) of information instances (ie; entity …,International Journal of Advances on Networks and Services,2010,13

Strategic management for real-time business intelligence,Konstantinos Zoumpatianos; Themis Palpanas; John Mylopoulos,Abstract Even though much research has been devoted on real-time data warehousing;most of it ignores business concerns that underlie all uses of such data. The completeBusiness Intelligence (BI) problem begins with modeling and analysis of business objectivesand specifications; followed by a systematic derivation of real-time BI queries on warehousedata. In this position paper; we motivate the need for the development of a complete RealTime BI stack able to continuously evaluate and reason about strategic objectives. We arguethat an integrated system; able to receive formal specifications of the organization's strategicobjectives and to transform them into a set of queries that are continuously evaluatedagainst the warehouse; offers significant benefits.

To compare or not to compare: making entity resolution more efficient,George Papadakis; Ekaterini Ioannou; Claudia Niederée; Themis Palpanas; Wolfgang Nejdl,Abstract Blocking methods are crucial for making the inherently quadratic task of EntityResolution more efficient. The blocking methods proposed in the literature rely on thehomogeneity of data and the availability of binding schema information; thus; they areinapplicable to the voluminous; noisy; and highly heterogeneous data of the Web 2.0 user-generated content. To deal with such data; attribute-agnostic blocking has been recentlyintroduced; following a two-fold strategy: the first layer places entities into overlapping blocksin order to achieve high effectiveness; while the second layer reduces the number ofunnecessary comparisons in order to enhance efficiency. In this paper; we present a set oftechniques that can be plugged into the second strategy layer of attribute-agnostic blockingto further improve its efficiency.

Scaling Entity Resolution to Large; Heterogeneous Data with Enhanced Meta-blocking.,George Papadakis; George Papastefanatos; Themis Palpanas; Manolis Koubarakis,ABSTRACT Entity Resolution constitutes a quadratic task that typically scales to large entitycollections through blocking. The resulting blocks can be restructured by Meta-blocking inorder to significantly increase precision at a limited cost in recall. Yet; its processing can betime-consuming; while its precision remains poor for configurations with high recall. In thiswork; we propose new meta-blocking methods that improve precision by up to an order ofmagnitude at a negligible cost to recall. We also introduce two efficiency techniques that;when combined; reduce the overhead time of Metablocking by more than an order ofmagnitude. We evaluate our approaches through an extensive experimental study over 6realworld; heterogeneous datasets. The outcomes indicate that our new algorithmsoutperform all meta-blocking techniques as well as the state-of-the-art methods for block …,EDBT,2016,11
Sliding windows over uncertain data streams,Michele Dallachiesa; Gabriela Jacques-Silva; Buğra Gedik; Kun-Lung Wu; Themis Palpanas,Abstract Uncertain data streams can have tuples with both value and existential uncertainty.A tuple has value uncertainty when it can assume multiple possible values. A tuple isexistentially uncertain when the sum of the probabilities of its possible values is<< 1. Asituation where existential uncertainty can arise is when applying relational operators tostreams with value uncertainty. Several prior works have focused on querying and miningdata streams with both value and existential uncertainty. However; none of them havestudied; in depth; the implications of existential uncertainty on sliding window processing;even though it naturally arises when processing uncertain data. In this work; we study thechallenges arising from existential uncertainty; more specifically the management of count-based sliding windows; which are a basic building block of stream processing …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2015,11
Conditional heavy hitters: detecting interesting correlations in data streams,Katsiaryna Mirylenka; Graham Cormode; Themis Palpanas; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract The notion of heavy hitters—items that make up a large fraction of the population—has been successfully used in a variety of applications across sensor and RFID monitoring;network data analysis; event mining; and more. Yet this notion often fails to capture thesemantics we desire when we observe data in the form of correlated pairs. Here; we areinterested in items that are conditionally frequent: when a particular item is frequent withinthe context of its parent item. In this work; we introduce and formalize the notion ofconditional heavy hitters to identify such items; with applications in network monitoring andMarkov chain modeling. We explore the relationship between conditional heavy hitters andother related notions in the literature; and show analytically and experimentally theusefulness of our approach.

IQR: an interactive query relaxation system for the empty-answer problem,Davide Mottin; Alice Marascu; Senjuti Basu Roy; Gautam Das; Themis Palpanas; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract We present IQR; a system that demonstrates optimization based interactiverelaxations for queries that return an empty answer. Given an empty answer; IQRdynamically suggests one relaxation of the original query conditions at a time to the user;based on certain optimization objectives; and the user responds by either accepting ordeclining the relaxation; until the user arrives at a non-empty answer; or a non-emptyanswer is impossible to achieve with any further relaxations. The relaxation suggestionshinge on a proba-bilistic framework that takes into account the probability of the useraccepting a suggested relaxation; as well as how much that relaxation serves towards theoptimization objec-tive.

Identifying streaming frequent items in ad hoc time windows,Michele Dallachiesa; Themis Palpanas,Abstract The problem of frequent item discovery in streaming data has attracted a lot ofattention; mainly because of its numerous applications in diverse domains; such as networktraffic monitoring and e-business transactions analysis. While the above problem has beenstudied extensively; and several techniques have been proposed for its solution; theseapproaches are geared towards the recent values in the stream. Nevertheless; in severalsituations the users would like to be able to query about the item frequencies in ad hocwindows in the stream history; and compare these values among themselves. In this paper;we address the problem of finding frequent items in ad hoc windows in a data stream givena small bounded memory; and present novel algorithms to this direction.

Exemplar queries: a new way of searching,Davide Mottin; Matteo Lissandrini; Yannis Velegrakis; Themis Palpanas,Abstract Modern search engines employ advanced techniques that go beyond the structuresthat strictly satisfy the query conditions in an effort to better capture the user intentions. In thiswork; we introduce a novel query paradigm that considers a user query as an example of thedata in which the user is interested. We call these queries exemplar queries. We provide aformal specification of their semantics and show that they are fundamentally different fromnotions like queries by example; approximate queries and related queries. We provide animplementation of these semantics for knowledge graphs and present an exact solution witha number of optimizations that improve performance without compromising the result quality.We study two different congruence relations; isomorphism and strong simulation; foridentifying the answers to an exemplar query. We also provide an approximate solution …,The VLDB Journal,2016,10
Big sequence management: A glimpse of the past; the present; and the future,Themis Palpanas,Abstract There is an increasingly pressing need; by several applications in diverse domains;for developing techniques able to index and mine very large collections of sequences; ordata series. Examples of such applications come from biology; astronomy; entomology; theweb; and other domains. It is not unusual for these applications to involve numbers of dataseries in the order of hundreds of millions to billions; which are often times not analyzed intheir full detail due to their sheer size. In this work; we describe recent efforts in designingtechniques for indexing and mining truly massive collections of data series that will enablescientists to easily analyze their data. We show that the main bottleneck in mining suchmassive datasets is the time taken to build the index; and we thus introduce solutions to thisproblem. Furthermore; we discuss novel techniques that adaptively create data series …,International Conference on Current Trends in Theory and Practice of Informatics,2016,10
Query workloads for data series indexes,Kostas Zoumpatianos; Yin Lou; Themis Palpanas; Johannes Gehrke,Abstract Data series are a prevalent data type that has attracted lots of interest in recentyears. Most of the research has focused on how to efficiently support similarity or nearestneighbor queries over large data series collections (an important data mining task); andseveral data series summarization and indexing methods have been proposed in order tosolve this problem. Nevertheless; up to this point very little attention has been paid toproperly evaluating such index structures; with most previous work relying solely onrandomly selected data series to use as queries (with/without adding noise). In this work; weshow that random workloads are inherently not suitable for the task at hand and we arguethat there is a need for carefully generating a query workload. We define measures thatcapture the characteristics of queries; and we propose a method for generating workloads …,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,10

An entity subscription service informssubscribed users of changes in the descriptive data of an entity; which is a set of attributename-value pairs. We study the design; implementation and application of an adaptablepush-policy subscription service; within a large-scale ENS. The subscription system aims todeliver ranked descriptions of the changes on entities; following user preferences through afeedback-driven adaptation process. The adaptation is based on both the content and thetype of each entity change. We evaluate the learning curve of the system and the utility of thecontent-type discrimination. The experiments demonstrate good results; especially in the …,Future Computing; Service Computation; Cognitive; Adaptive; Content; Patterns; 2009. COMPUTATIONWORLD'09. Computation World:,2009,10
Whitewater: Distributed processing of fast streams,Ioana Stanoi; George Mihaila; Themis Palpanas; Christian Lang,Monitoring systems today often involve continuous queries over streaming data in adistributed collaborative fashion. The distribution of query operators over a network ofprocessors; as well as their processing sequence; form a query configuration with inherentconstraints on the throughput that it can support. In this paper; we discuss the implications ofmeasuring and optimizing for output throughput; as well as its limitations. We propose to useinstead the more granular input throughput and a version of throughput measure; theprofiled input throughput; that is focused on matching the expected behavior of the inputstreams. We show how we can evaluate a query configuration based on profiled inputthroughput and that the problem of finding the optimal configuration is NP-hard.Furthermore; we describe how we can overcome the complexity limitation by adapting hill …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2007,10
A systematic approach for dynamic targeted monitoring of kpis,Alejandro Maté; Kostas Zoumpatianos; Themis Palpanas; Juan Trujillo; John Mylopoulos; Elvis Koci,Abstract There has been growing interest for more than a decade in Business Analytics as ameans for improving business performance. One of the most popular Business Analyticstechnique involves monitoring performance by means of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).A KPI is a powerful tool that relates enterprise data to business goals; thereby enablingmanagers to guide the analytic process and identify deviations in their strategic plan.Nevertheless; monitoring KPIs requires that they are evaluated at multiple levels of detail; inorder to identify potential problems earlier instead of being noted after the fact.Unfortunately; there are obstacles to the generation and enactment of such monitoringprocesses. In particular; there is no systematic; tool-supported process for defining what is tobe monitored given a strategic plan; nor are there tools for automatically generating …,Proceedings of 24th annual international conference on computer science and software engineering,2014,9

Imagine you are in Milano for the Design Week. You have just spent a couple ofdays attending few nice events in Brera district. Which of the other hundreds of eventsspread around in Milano shall you attend now? This paper presents a system able torecommend venues to the visitors of such a city-scale event based on the digital footprintsthey left on Social Media. By combining deductive and inductive stream reasoningtechniques with visitor-modeling functionality; this system semantically analyses and linksvisitors' social network activities to produce high-quality recommendations even wheninformation about visitors' preferences for venues and events is sparse.,S4SC@ ISWC,2014,9
Towards mega-modeling: a walk through data analysis experiences,Stefano Ceri; Themis Palpanas; Emanuele Della Valle; Dino Pedreschi; Johann-Christoph Freytag; Roberto Trasarti,Big data is perceived as a fundamental ingredient for fostering the progress of science in avariety of disciplines. However; we believe that the current ICT solutions are not adequatefor this challenge. Abstractions and languages for big data management are tailored tovertical domains and influenced by underlying ICT platforms; hence unsuitable forsupporting “computational interdisciplinarity”; as it is required if one wants to use the best of;eg; analytical; inductive; and simulation techniques; all at work on the same data.

Corpus evidence for age effects on priming in child language,Jeffrey Gerard; Frank Keller; Themis Palpanas,Abstract Structural priming; the tendency to repeat previously uttered syntactic structures;can give insight into human language processing and acquisition. We report two corpus-based studies of children's structural priming that test the following claim of the item-basedaccount of language acquisition: as older children generalize over structures; primingincreases with age. A hypothesis derived from this claim; viz.; that the lexical boost effectdecreases with age; is also tested. We fit mixed-effects logistic regression models on datafrom children aged 2 to 7.5 years from the CHILDES corpus. We demonstrate structuralpriming of arbitrary syntactic structures for the first time in child language data. We also findevidence that priming increases with age; but fail to confirm the hypothesis that the lexicalboost effect decreases with age.,Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society,2010,9
Revisiting the effect of history on learning performance: The problem of the demanding lord,George Giannakopoulos; Themis Palpanas,Abstract In a variety of settings ranging from recommendation systems to informationfiltering; approaches which take into account feedback have been introduced to improveservices and user experience. However; as also indicated in the machine learning literature;there exist several settings where the requirements and target concept of a learning systemchanges over time; which consists a case of “concept drift”. In several systems; a slidingwindow over the training instances has been used to follow drifting concepts. However; nogeneral analytic study has been performed on the relation between the size of the slidingwindow and the average performance of a learning system; since previous works havefocused on instantaneous performance and specific underlying learners and datacharacteristics.

Finding interesting correlations with conditional heavy hitters,Katsiaryna Mirylenka; Themis Palpanas; Graham Cormode; Divesh Srivastava,The notion of heavy hitters-items that make up a large fraction of the population-has beensuccessfully used in a variety of applications across sensor and RFID monitoring; networkdata analysis; event mining; and more. Yet this notion often fails to capture the semantics wedesire when we observe data in the form of correlated pairs. Here; we are interested in itemsthat are conditionally frequent: when a particular item is frequent within the context of itsparent item. In this work; we introduce and formalize the notion of Conditional Heavy Hittersto identify such items; with applications in network monitoring; and Markov chain modeling.We introduce several streaming algorithms that allow us to find conditional heavy hittersefficiently; and provide analytical results. Different algorithms are successful for differentinput characteristics.

Detecting and exploiting stability in evolving heterogeneous information spaces,George Papadakis; George Giannakopoulos; Claudia Niederée; Themis Palpanas; Wolfgang Nejdl,Abstract Individuals contribute content on the Web at an unprecedented rate; accumulatingimmense quantities of (semi-) structured data. Wisdom of the Crowds theory advocates thatsuch information (or parts of it) is constantly overwritten; updated; or even deleted by otherusers; with the goal of rendering it more accurate; or up-to-date. This is particularly true forthe collaboratively edited; semi-structured data of entity repositories; whose entity profilesare consistently kept fresh. Therefore; their core information that remain stable with thepassage of time; despite being reviewed by numerous users; are particularly useful for thedescription of an entity. Based on the above hypothesis; we introduce a classificationscheme that predicts; on the basis of statistical and content patterns; whether an attribute (ie;name-value pair) is going to be modified in the future.

Reducing retrieval latencies in the Web: the past; the present; and the future,Themistoklis Palpanas; Balachander Krishnamurthy,Abstract One of the main directions of research in the Web is to reduce the time latenciesusers experience when navigating through Web sites. The work in this direction originatedfrom relevant research in operating systems (eg caching); where the aim is to reduce lesystem latencies. Caching is already being used in the Web domain. However; recentstudies indicate that the bene ts from this technique are rather limited. Thus; another methodthat was rst applied in operating systems; prefetching; is now being studied in the Webcontext. In addition to prefetching; there is a number of other techniques that are beingexamined in the Web domain and are speci cally targeted to this environment. Thesetechniques include compression; and piggybacking of information between the servers andthe clients.

Unleashing the power of information graphs,Matteo Lissandrini; Davide Mottin; Themis Palpanas; Dimitra Papadimitriou; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract Information graphs are generic graphs that model different types of informationthrough nodes and edges. Knowledge graphs are the most common type of informationgraphs in which nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships among them. Inthis paper; we argue that exploitation of information graphs can lead into novel queryanswering capabilities that go beyond the existing capabilities of keyword search; and focuson one of them; namely; exemplar queries. Exemplar queries is a recently introducedparadigm that treats a user query as an example from the desired result set. In this paper; wedescribe the foundations of exemplar queries and the significant role of information graphs;and we present several applications and relevant research directions.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2015,6

Updating a data warehouse schema based on changes in an observation model,*,A method; information processing system; and computer readable medium for modifying atleast one data warehouse schema based on detected changes in an associated observationmodel are disclosed. The method includes determining if at least one new observationmodel has been created. The method also includes determining if at least one existingobservation model is associated with the new observation model. In response to the existingobservation model being associated with the new observation model; at least one changedattribute is identified by comparing the new observation model and the existing observationmodel. A set of files associated with the existing observation model is updated to reflect thechanged attribute between the new observation model and the existing observation model.,*,2011,6

Social networking sites have gained much popularity in the recent years; becauseof the opportunities they give people to connect to each other in an easy and timely manner;and to exchange and share various kinds of information. However; these sites arearchitected based on a centralized paradigm; which limits the mobility of their users; andultimately; their chances for establishing new relationships and benefiting from diversenetworking services. In this paper; we argue for a decentralized paradigm for socialnetworking; in which users retain control of their profiles; and social networking sites focuson the delivery of innovative and competitive services.

Topic-related sentiment analysis for discovering contradicting opinions in weblogs,Kerstin Denecke; Mikalai Tsytsarau; Themis Palpanas; Marko Brosowski,This work addresses the problem of analyzing the evolution of community opinions acrosstime. First; a two-step approach is introduced to determine a continuous sentiment value foreach topic discussed in a text based on SentiWordNet as lexical resource. Sentences areclustered according to their topic using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Both steps are extensivelyevaluated and tested. The output is then exploited for studying contradictions among weblogposts and comments. We introduce a novel measure for contradictions based on a meanvalue and the variance of opinions among different posts. In addition; a method is proposed;which identifies posts with contradicting opinions on certain topics on a basis of such ameasure. It can be used to analyze and track opinion evolution over time and to identifyinteresting trends and patterns. The developed algorithm is applied to a dataset of …,*,2009,6
Online Distribution Estimation for Streaming Data: Framework and Applications.,Themis Palpanas; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract. In the last few years; we have been witnessing an evergrowing need for continuousobservation and monitoring applications.

Characterizing home device usage from wireless traffic time series,Katsiaryna Mirylenka; Vassilis Christophides; Themis Palpanas; Ioannis Pefkianakis; Martin May,The analysis of temporal behavioral patterns of home network users can reveal importantinformation to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and help them to optimize their networks andoffer new services (eg; remote software upgrades; troubleshooting; energy savings). Thisstudy uses time series analysis of continuous traffic data from wireless home networks; toextract traffic patterns recurring within; or across homes; and assess the impact of differentdevice types (fixed or portable) on home traffic. Traditional techniques for time seriesanalysis are not suited in this respect; due to the limited stationary and evolving distributionproperties of wireless home traffic data.

Defining and measuring data-driven quality dimension of staleness,Oleksiy Chayka; Themis Palpanas; Paolo Bouquet,With the growing complexity of data acquisition and processing methods; there is anincreasing demand in understanding which data is outdated and how to have it as fresh aspossible. Staleness is one of the key; time-related; data quality characteristics; thatrepresents a degree of synchronization between data originators and information systemspossessing the data. However; nowadays there is no common and pervasive notion of datastaleness; as well as methods for its measurement in a wide scope of applications. Our workprovides a definition of a data-driven notion of staleness for information systems withfrequently updatable data. For such a data; we demonstrate an efficient exponentialsmoothing method of staleness measurement; compared to naïve approaches; using thesame limited amount of memory; based on averaging of frequency of updates.

On space constrained set selection problems,Themis Palpanas; Nick Koudas; Alberto Mendelzon,Abstract Space constrained optimization problems arise in a variety of applications; rangingfrom databases to ubiquitous computing. Typically; these problems involve selecting a set ofitems of interest; subject to a space constraint. We show that in many important applications;one faces variants of this basic problem; in which the individual items are sets themselves;and each set is associated with a benefit value. Since there are no known approximationalgorithms for these problems; we explore the use of greedy and randomized techniques.We present a detailed performance and theoretical evaluation of the algorithms; highlightingthe efficiency of the proposed solutions.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2008,5
Boosting the efficiency of large-scale entity resolution with enhanced meta-blocking,George Papadakis; George Papastefanatos; Themis Palpanas; Manolis Koubarakis,Abstract Entity Resolution constitutes a quadratic task that typically scales to large entitycollections through blocking. The resulting blocks can be restructured by Meta-blocking toraise precision at a limited cost in recall. At the core of this procedure lies the blocking graph;where the nodes correspond to entities and the edges connect the comparable pairs. Thereare several configurations for Meta-blocking; but no hints on best practices. In general; thenode-centric approaches are more robust and suitable for a series of applications; but sufferfrom low precision; due to the large number of unnecessary comparisons they retain. In thiswork; we present three novel methods for node-centric Meta-blocking that significantlyimprove precision. We also introduce a pre-processing method that restricts the size of theblocking graph by removing a large number of noisy edges. As a result; it reduces the …,Big Data Research,2016,4
A holistic and principled approach for the empty-answer problem,Davide Mottin; Alice Marascu; Senjuti Basu Roy; Gautam Das; Themis Palpanas; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract We propose a principled optimization-based interactive query relaxation frameworkfor queries that return no answers. Given an initial query that returns an empty-answer set;our framework dynamically computes and suggests alternative queries with fewer conditionsthan those the user has initially requested; in order to help the user arrive at a query with anon-empty-answer; or at a query for which no matter how many additional conditions areignored; the answer will still be empty. Our proposed approach for suggesting queryrelaxations is driven by a novel probabilistic framework based on optimizing a wide varietyof application-dependent objective functions. We describe optimal and approximatesolutions of different optimization problems using the framework.

Therefore; the choice of a good algorithm for a particularlearning problem is crucial. In this paper; we introduce the “Sigmoid Rule” Frameworkfocusing on the description of classifier behavior in noisy settings. The framework uses anexisting model of the expected performance of learning algorithms as a sigmoid function ofthe signal-to-noise ratio in the training instances. We study the parameters of the abovesigmoid function using five different classifiers; namely; Naive Bayes; kNN; SVM; a decisiontree classifier; and a rule-based classifier.

Data series management: The next challenge,Themis Palpanas,There is an increasingly pressing need; by several applications in diverse domains; fordeveloping techniques able to index and mine very large collections of sequences; or dataseries. Examples of such applications come from biology; astronomy; entomology; the web;and other domains. It is not unusual for these applications to involve numbers of data seriesin the order of hundreds of millions to billions; which are often times not analyzed in their fulldetail due to their sheer size.

Node classification in uncertain graphs,Michele Dallachiesa; Charu Aggarwal; Themis Palpanas,Abstract In many real applications that use and analyze networked data; the links in thenetwork graph may be erroneous; or derived from probabilistic techniques. In such cases;the node classification problem can be challenging; since the unreliability of the links mayaffect the final results of the classification process. In this paper; we focus on situations thatrequire the analysis of the uncertainty that is present in the graph structure.

Updating a data warehouse schema based on changes in an observation model,*,A method; information processing system; and computer readable medium for modifying atleast one data warehouse schema based on detected changes in an associated observationmodel are disclosed. The method includes determining if at least one new observationmodel has been created. The method also includes determining if at least one existingobservation model is associated with the new observation model. In response to the existingobservation model being associated with the new observation model; at least one changedattribute is identified by comparing the new observation model and the existing observationmodel. A set of files associated with the existing observation model is updated to reflect thechanged attribute between the new observation model and the existing observation model.,*,2014,3
dbTrento: the data and information management group at the University of Trento,Themis Palpanas; Yannis Velegrakis,[Semantic-based Keyword Search] Keyword search is becoming the de-facto mechanism forquerying data [19]; since it does not require knowledge of the full semantics or theirorganization in the repository; neither knowledge of some complex query language. For thisreason; there has been enough work on querying structured (mostly relational) data throughkeywords. These works are typically based on an index that is built in advance; and whichsupports at run time the mapping of,ACM SIGMOD Record,2012,3
Cloudalloc: A monitoring and reservation system for compute clusters,Enrico Iori; Alkis Simitsis; Themis Palpanas; Kevin Wilkinson; Stavros Harizopoulos,Abstract Cloud computing has emerged as a promising environment capable of providingflexibility; scalability; elasticity; fail-over mechanisms; high availability; and other importantfeatures to applications. Compute clusters are relatively easy to create and use; but tools toeffectively share cluster resources are lacking. CloudAlloc addresses this problem andschedules workloads to cluster resources using allocation algorithms that can be easilychanged according to the objectives of the enterprise. It also monitors resource utilizationand thus; provides accountability for actual usage. CloudAlloc is a lightweight; flexible; easy-to-use tool for cluster resource allocation that has also proved useful as a research platform.We demonstrate its features and also discuss its allocation algorithms that minimize powerusage. CloudAlloc was implemented and is in use at HP Labs.,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,3
Knowledge Mining for the Business Analyst,Themis Palpanas; Jakka Sairamesh,Abstract There is an extensive literature on data mining techniques; including severalapplications of these techniques in the e-commerce setting. However; all previousapproaches require that expert users interpret the data mining results; making themcumbersome to use by business analysts. In this work; we describe a framework that showshow data mining technology can be effectively applied in an e-commerce environment;delivering significant benefits to the business analyst. Using a real-world case study; wedemonstrate the added benefit of the proposed method. We also validate the claim that theproduced results represent actionable knowledge that can help the business analystimprove the business performance; by significantly reducing the time needed for dataanalysis; which results in substantial financial savings.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2008,3

New trends on exploratory methods for data analytics,Davide Mottin; Matteo Lissandrini; Yannis Velegrakis; Themis Palpanas,Abstract Data usually comes in a plethora of formats and dimensions; rendering theexploration and information extraction processes cumbersome. Thus; being able to castexploratory queries in the data with the intent of having an immediate glimpse on some ofthe data properties is becoming crucial. An exploratory query should be simple enough toavoid complicate declarative languages (such as SQL) and mechanisms; and at the sametime retain the flexibility and expressiveness of such languages. Recently; we havewitnessed a rediscovery of the so called example-based methods; in which the user; or theanalyst circumvent query languages by using examples as input. An example is arepresentative of the intended results; or in other words; an item from the result set.

The Parallel and Distributed Future of Data Series Mining,Themis Palpanas,There is an increasingly pressing need; by several applications in diverse domains; fordeveloping techniques able to index and mine very large collections of sequences; or dataseries. Examples of such applications come from biology; astronomy; entomology; the web;and other domains. It is not unusual for these applications to involve numbers of data seriesin the order of hundreds of millions to billions; which are often times not analyzed in their fulldetail due to their sheer size. In this work; we describe past efforts in designing techniquesfor indexing and mining truly massive collections of data series; based on indexingtechniques for fast similarity search; an operation that lies at the core of many miningalgorithms. We show that there are two bottlenecks in mining such massive datasets;namely; the time taken to build the index; and the time required to answer exactly …,High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS); 2017 International Conference on,2017,2

On classifier behavior in the presence of mislabeling noise,Katsiaryna Mirylenka; George Giannakopoulos; Themis Palpanas,Abstract Machine learning algorithms perform differently in settings with varying levels oftraining set mislabeling noise. Therefore; the choice of the right algorithm for a particularlearning problem is crucial. The contribution of this paper is towards two; dual problems: first;comparing algorithm behavior; and second; choosing learning algorithms for noisy settings.We present the “sigmoid rule” framework; which can be used to choose the most appropriatelearning algorithm depending on the properties of noise in a classification problem. Theframework uses an existing model of the expected performance of learning algorithms as asigmoid function of the signal-to-noise ratio in the training instances. We study thecharacteristics of the sigmoid function using five representative non-sequential classifiers;namely; Naïve Bayes; kNN; SVM; a decision tree classifier; and a rule-based classifier …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2017,2
Managing Diverse Sentiments at Large Scale,Mikalai Tsytsarau; Themis Palpanas,The large-scale aggregation and analysis of user opinions is becoming increasinglyrelevant to a variety of applications; from detecting social mood on some political topics totracking their sentiment changes related to events. The analysis of diverse sentiments isanother important application; which becomes possible based on the ability of modernmethods to capture sentiment polarity on various topics with high precision and on the ever-growing scale. Therefore; there is a need for a scalable way of sentiment aggregation withrespect to the time dimension; which stores enough information to preserve diversity; andwhich allows statistically accurate analysis of sentiment trends and opinion shifts. In thispaper; we are focusing on the novel problem of aggregating diverse sentiments at a largescale; based on data sources that are continuously updated.

Cache management policies for semantic caching,Themistoklis Palpanas; Per-Åke Larson; Jonathan Goldstein,Abstract Commercial database systems make extensive use of caching to speed up queryexecution. Semantic caching is the idea of caching actual query results in the hope of beingable to reuse them to speed up subsequent queries. This paper deals with cachemanagement policies; which refer to policies for admission into the cache and eviction fromthe cache. When a query is executed; we must decide what part; if any; of the query result toadd to the cache. If the cache is full; we must also decide which; if any; of the currentlycached results to evict from the cache. The objective of these policies is to minimize the costof executing the current and future queries or; phrased differently; maximize the benefit ofthe cache. The main difficulty is predicting the cost savings of future queries. In this study wepresent a family of cache admission and eviction policies; named RECYCLE; specifically …,*,2001,2
Data Series Management: Fulfilling the Need for Big Sequence Analytics,Kostas Zoumpatianos; Themis Palpanas,Abstract—Massive data sequence collections exist in virtually every scientific and socialdomain; and have to be analyzed to extract useful knowledge. However; no existing datamanagement solution (such as relational databases; column stores; array databases; andtime series management systems) can offer native support for sequences and thecorresponding operators necessary for complex analytics. We argue for the need to studythe theory and foundations for sequence management of big data sequences; and to buildcorresponding systems that will enable scalable management and analysis of very largesequence collections. To this effect; we need to develop novel techniques to efficientlysupport a wide range of sequence queries and mining operations; while leveraging modernhardware.

In this work; wepropose ULISSE; the first data series index structure designed for answering similaritysearch queries of variable length. Our contribution is two-fold. First; we introduce a novelrepresentation technique; which effectively and succinctly summarizes multiple sequencesof different length. Based on the proposed index; we describe efficient algorithms forapproximate and exact similarity search; combining disk based index visits and in-memorysequential scans.

These data are thenprocessed and analyzed using a large variety of techniques; most of which are based on thecomputation of some distance function. In this study; we evaluate the benefits ofincorporating into the distance functions correlation measures; which enable us to capturethe associations among neighboring values in the sequence. We propose three suchmeasures; inspired by statistical and probabilistic approaches.

Blocking for large-scale Entity Resolution: Challenges; algorithms; and practical examples,George Papadakis; Themis Palpanas,Entity Resolution constitutes one of the cornerstone tasks for the integration of overlappinginformation sources. Due to its quadratic complexity; a large amount of research has focusedon improving its efficiency so that it scales to Web Data collections; which are inherentlyvoluminous and highly heterogeneous. The most common approach for this purpose isblocking; which clusters similar entities into blocks so that the pair-wise comparisons arerestricted to the entities contained within each block. In this tutorial; we take a close look onblocking-based Entity Resolution; starting from the early blocking methods that were craftedfor database integration. We highlight the challenges posed by contemporaryheterogeneous; noisy; voluminous Web Data and explain why they render inapplicablethese schema-based techniques.

Diverse dimension decomposition for itemset spaces,Mikalai Tsytsarau; Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis; Themis Palpanas,Abstract We introduce the problem of diverse dimension decomposition in transactionaldatabases; where a dimension is a set of mutually exclusive itemsets. The problem weconsider requires to find a decomposition of the itemset space into dimensions; which areorthogonal to each other and which provide high coverage of the input database. Themining framework we propose can be interpreted as a dimensionality-reducingtransformation from the space of all items to the space of orthogonal dimensions. Relying oninformation-theoretic concepts; we formulate the diverse dimension decomposition problemwith a single objective function that simultaneously captures constraints on coverage;exclusivity; and orthogonality.

Thismeasure is focused on matching the expected behavior of the input streams. To prune thesearch space we used hill-climbing techniques that proved to be efficient and effective.,Proceedings of the 15th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2006,1

Space constrained selection problems for data warehouses and pervasive computing,Themistoklis Palpanas; N Kouda; Alberto Mendelzon,Space constrained optimization problems arise in a multitude of important applications suchas data warehouses and pervasive computing. A typical instance of such problems is toselect a set of items of interest; subject to a constraint on the total space occupied by theseitems. Assuming that each item is associated with a benefit; for a suitably defined notion ofbenefit; one wishes to optimize the total benefit for the selected items. We show that in manyimportant applications; one faces variants of this basic problem in which the individual itemsare sets themselves; and each set is associated with a benefit value. We present instancesof such problems in the context of data warehouse management and pervasive computing;derive their complexity; and propose several techniques for solving them. Since there are noknown approximation algorithms for these problems; we explore the use of greedy and …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2003. 15th International Conference on,2003,*

Multi-Example Search in Rich Information Graphs,Matteo Lissandrini; Davide Mottin; Themis Palpanas; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract—In rich information spaces; it is often hard for users to formally specify thecharacteristics of the desired answers; either due to the complexity of the schema or of thequery language; or even because they do not know exactly what they are looking for.Exemplar queries constitute a query paradigm that overcomes those problems; by allowingusers to provide examples of the elements of interest in place of the query specification. Inthis paper; we propose a general approach where the user-provided example can compriseseveral partial specification fragments; where each fragment describes only one part of thedesired result. We provide a formal definition of the problem; which generalizes existingformulations for both the relational and the graph model. We then describe exact algorithmsfor its solution for the case of information graphs; as well as top-k algorithms. Experiments …,*,*,*

Since itsfirst release in 2008; the service has undergone significant architectural improvements; andhas extended its functionality to support a better interaction with the Linked Data idea. In thispaper we will describe the new architecture of the second release of the ENS; give detailsabout its implementation and performance; and provide an in-depth description of theservices that it provides to Web users; the Semantic Web community; and the Linked Datacommunity in particular.,*,*,*
