On discovery of gathering patterns from trajectories,Kai Zheng; Yu Zheng; Nicholas Jing Yuan; Shuo Shang,The increasing pervasiveness of location-acquisition technologies has enabled collection ofhuge amount of trajectories for almost any kind of moving objects. Discovering usefulpatterns from their movement behaviours can convey valuable knowledge to a variety ofcritical applications. In this light; we propose a novel concept; called gathering; which is atrajectory pattern modelling various group incidents such as celebrations; parades; protests;traffic jams and so on. A key observation is that these incidents typically involve largecongregations of individuals; which form durable and stable areas with high density. Sincethe process of discovering gathering patterns over large-scale trajectory databases can bequite lengthy; we further develop a set of well thought out techniques to improve theperformance.

Reducing uncertainty of low-sampling-rate trajectories,Kai Zheng; Yu Zheng; Xing Xie; Xiaofang Zhou,The increasing availability of GPS-embedded mobile devices has given rise to a newspectrum of location-based services; which have accumulated a huge collection of locationtrajectories. In practice; a large portion of these trajectories are of low-sampling-rate. Forinstance; the time interval between consecutive GPS points of some trajectories can beseveral minutes or even hours. With such a low sampling rate; most details of theirmovement are lost; which makes them difficult to process effectively. In this work; weinvestigate how to reduce the uncertainty in such kind of trajectories. Specifically; given alow-sampling-rate trajectory; we aim to infer its possible routes. The methodology adopted inour work is to take full advantage of the rich information extracted from the historicaltrajectories. We propose a systematic solution; History based Route Inference System …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,108
User Oriented Trajectory Search for Trip Recommendation,Shuo Shang; Ruogu Ding; Bo Yuan; Kexin Xie; Kai Zheng; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Trajectory sharing and searching have received significant attentions in recentyears. In this paper; we propose and investigate a novel problem called User OrientedTrajectory Search (UOTS) for trip recommendation. In contrast to conventional trajectorysearch by locations (spatial domain only); we consider both spatial and textual domains inthe new UOTS query. Given a trajectory data set; the query input contains a set of intendedplaces given by the traveler and a set of textual attributes describing the traveler'spreference. If a trajectory is connecting/close to the specified query locations; and the textualattributes of the trajectory are similar to the traveler'e preference; it will be recommended tothe traveler for reference. This type of queries can bring significant benefits to travelers inmany popular applications such as trip planning and recommendation. There are two …,EDBT Conference,2012,81
Towards efficient search for activity trajectories,Kai Zheng; Shuo Shang; Nicholas Jing Yuan; Yi Yang,The advances in location positioning and wireless communication technologies have led toa myriad of spatial trajectories representing the mobility of a variety of moving objects. Whileprocessing trajectory data with the focus of spatio-temporal features has been widely studiedin the last decade; recent proliferation in location-based web applications (eg; Foursquare;Facebook) has given rise to large amounts of trajectories associated with activityinformation; called activity trajectory. In this paper; we study the problem of efficient similaritysearch on activity trajectory database. Given a sequence of query locations; each associatedwith a set of desired activities; an activity trajectory similarity query (ATSQ) returns ktrajectories that cover the query activities and yield the shortest minimum match distance. Anorder-sensitive activity trajectory similarity query (OATSQ) is also proposed to take into …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,80
Probabilistic range queries for uncertain trajectories on road networks,Kai Zheng; Goce Trajcevski; Xiaofang Zhou; Peter Scheuermann,Abstract Trajectories representing the motion of moving objects are typically obtained vialocation sampling; eg using GPS or road-side sensors; at discrete time-instants. In-betweenconsecutive samples; nothing is known about the whereabouts of a given moving object.Various models have been proposed (eg; sheared cylinders; spacetime prisms) to representthe uncertainty of the moving objects both in unconstrained Euclidian space; as well as roadnetworks. In this paper; we focus on representing the uncertainty of the objects moving alongroad networks as time-dependent probability distribution functions; assuming availability of amaximal speed on each road segment. For these settings; we introduce a novel indexingmechanism--UTH (Uncertain Trajectories Hierarchy); based upon which efficient algorithmsfor processing spatio-temporal range queries are proposed. We also present …,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2011,80
Discovering urban functional zones using latent activity trajectories,Nicholas Jing Yuan; Yu Zheng; Xing Xie; Yingzi Wang; Kai Zheng; Hui Xiong,The step of urbanization and modern civilization fosters different functional zones in a city;such as residential areas; business districts; and educational areas. In a metropolis; peoplecommute between these functional zones every day to engage in different socioeconomicactivities; eg; working; shopping; and entertaining. In this paper; we propose a data-drivenframework to discover functional zones in a city. Specifically; we introduce the concept oflatent activity trajectory (LAT); which captures socioeconomic activities conducted by citizensat different locations in a chronological order. Later; we segment an urban area intodisjointed regions according to major roads; such as highways and urban expressways. Wehave developed a topic-modeling-based approach to cluster the segmented regions intofunctional zones leveraging mobility and location semantics mined from LAT. Furthermore …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,74

In this paper; wepresent LifeSpec; a computational framework for exploring and hierarchically categorizingurban lifestyles. Specifically; we have developed an algorithm to connect multiple socialnetwork accounts of millions of individuals and collect their publicly availableheterogeneous behavioral data as well as social links. In addition; a nonparametricBayesian approach is developed to model the lifestyle spectrum of a group of individuals.

Short text understanding through lexical-semantic analysis,Wen Hua; Zhongyuan Wang; Haixun Wang; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,Understanding short texts is crucial to many applications; but challenges abound. First; shorttexts do not always observe the syntax of a written language. As a result; traditional naturallanguage processing methods cannot be easily applied. Second; short texts usually do notcontain sufficient statistical signals to support many state-of-the-art approaches for textprocessing such as topic modeling. Third; short texts are usually more ambiguous. We arguethat knowledge is needed in order to better understand short texts. In this work; we uselexical-semantic knowledge provided by a well-known semantic network for short textunderstanding. Our knowledge-intensive approach disrupts traditional methods for taskssuch as text segmentation; part-of-speech tagging; and concept labeling; in the sense thatwe focus on semantics in all these tasks.

An effectiveness study on trajectory similarity measures,Haozhou Wang; Han Su; Kai Zheng; Shazia Sadiq; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract The last decade has witnessed the prevalence of sensor and GPS technologies thatproduce a sheer volume of trajectory data representing the motion history of moving objects.Measuring similarity between trajectories is undoubtedly one of the most important tasks intrajectory data management since it serves as the foundation of many advanced analysessuch as similarity search; clustering; and classification. In this light; tremendous efforts havebeen spent on this topic; which results in a large number of trajectory similarity measures.Generally; each individual work introducing a new distance measure has made specificclaims on the superiority of their proposal. However; for most works; the experimental studywas focused on demonstrating the efficiency of the search algorithms; leaving theeffectiveness aspect unverified empirically. In this paper; we conduct a comparative …,Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Australasian Database Conference-Volume 137,2013,49
Calibrating trajectory data for similarity-based analysis,Han Su; Kai Zheng; Haozhou Wang; Jiamin Huang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Due to the prevalence of GPS-enabled devices and wireless communicationstechnologies; spatial trajectories that describe the movement history of moving objects arebeing generated and accumulated at an unprecedented pace. Trajectory data in a databaseare intrinsically heterogeneous; as they represent discrete approximations of originalcontinuous paths derived using different sampling strategies and different sampling rates.Such heterogeneity can have a negative impact on the effectiveness of trajectory similaritymeasures; which are the basis of many crucial trajectory processing tasks. In this paper; wepioneer a systematic approach to trajectory calibration that is a process to transform aheterogeneous trajectory dataset to one with (almost) unified sampling strategies.Specifically; we propose an anchor-based calibration system that aligns trajectories to a …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD international conference on management of data,2013,48
Multimedia event detection using a classifier-specific intermediate representation,Zhigang Ma; Yi Yang; Nicu Sebe; Kai Zheng; Alexander G Hauptmann,Multimedia event detection (MED) plays an important role in many applications such asvideo indexing and retrieval. Current event detection works mainly focus on sports and newsevent detection or abnormality detection in surveillance videos. Differently; our researchaims to detect more complicated and generic events within a longer video sequence. In thepast; researchers have proposed using intermediate concept classifiers with concept lexicato help understand the videos. Yet it is difficult to judge how many and what concepts wouldbe sufficient for the particular video analysis task. Additionally; obtaining robust semanticconcept classifiers requires a large number of positive training examples; which in turn hashigh human annotation cost.

Personalized trajectory matching in spatial networks,Shuo Shang; Ruogu Ding; Kai Zheng; Christian S Jensen; Panos Kalnis; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract With the increasing availability of moving-object tracking data; trajectory search andmatching is increasingly important. We propose and investigate a novel problem calledpersonalized trajectory matching (PTM). In contrast to conventional trajectory similaritysearch by spatial distance only; PTM takes into account the significance of each samplepoint in a query trajectory. A PTM query takes a trajectory with user-specified weights foreach sample point in the trajectory as its argument. It returns the trajectory in an argumentdata set with the highest similarity to the query trajectory. We believe that this type of querymay bring significant benefits to users in many popular applications such as route planning;carpooling; friend recommendation; traffic analysis; urban computing; and location-basedservices in general. PTM query processing faces two challenges: how to prune the search …,The VLDB Journal,2014,40
K-nearest neighbor search for fuzzy objects,Kai Zheng; Pui Cheong Fung; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract The K-Nearest Neighbor search (kNN) problem has been investigated extensivelyin the past due to its broad range of applications. In this paper we study this problem in thecontext of fuzzy objects that have indeterministic boundaries. Fuzzy objects play animportant role in many areas; such as biomedical image databases and GIS. Existingresearch on fuzzy objects mainly focuses on modelling basic fuzzy object types andoperations; leaving the processing of more advanced queries such as kNN queryuntouched. In this paper; we propose two new kinds of kNN queries for fuzzy objects; Ad-hockNN query (AKNN) and Range kNN query (RKNN); to find the k nearest objects qualifying ata probability threshold or within a probability range. For efficient AKNN query processing; weoptimize the basic best-first search algorithm by deriving more accurate approximations …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,38
Crowdplanner: A crowd-based route recommendation system,Han Su; Kai Zheng; Jiamin Huang; Hoyoung Jeung; Lei Chen; Xiaofang Zhou,As travel is taking more significant part in our life; route recommendation service becomes abig business and attracts many major players in IT industry. Given a pair of user-specifiedorigin and destination; a route recommendation service aims to provide users with the routesof best travelling experience according to criteria; such as travelling distance; travelling time;traffic condition; etc. However; previous research shows that even the routes recommendedby the big-thumb service providers can deviate significantly from the routes travelled byexperienced drivers. It means travellers' preferences on route selection are influenced bymany latent and dynamic factors that are hard to model exactly with pre-defined formulas. Inthis work we approach this challenging problem with a very different perspective-leveragingcrowds' knowledge to improve the recommendation quality.

Interactive top-k spatial keyword queries,Kai Zheng; Han Su; Bolong Zheng; Shuo Shang; Jiajie Xu; Jiajun Liu; Xiaofang Zhou,Conventional top-k spatial keyword queries require users to explicitly specify theirpreferences between spatial proximity and keyword relevance. In this work we investigatehow to eliminate this requirement by enhancing the conventional queries with interaction;resulting in Interactive Top-k Spatial Keyword (ITkSK) query. Having confirmed the feasibilityby theoretical analysis; we propose a three-phase solution focusing on both effectivenessand efficiency. The first phase substantially narrows down the search space for subsequentphases by efficiently retrieving a set of geo-textual k-skyband objects as the initialcandidates. In the second phase three practical strategies for selecting a subset ofcandidates are developed with the aim of maximizing the expected benefit for learning userpreferences at each round of interaction. Finally we discuss how to determine the …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,32
Approximate keyword search in semantic trajectory database,Bolong Zheng; Nicholas Jing Yuan; Kai Zheng; Xing Xie; Shazia Sadiq; Xiaofang Zhou,Driven by the advances in location positioning techniques and the popularity of locationsharing services; semantic enriched trajectory data have become unprecedentedlyavailable. While finding relevant Point-of-Interest (POIs) based on users' locations and querykeywords has been extensively studied in the past years; it is largely untouched to explorethe keyword queries in the context of semantic trajectory database. In this paper; we studythe problem of approximate keyword search in massive semantic trajectories. Given a set ofquery keywords; an approximate keyword query of semantic trajectory (AKQST) returns ktrajectories that contain the most relevant keywords to the query and yield the least traveleffort in the meantime. The main difference between AKQST and conventional spatialkeyword queries is that there is no query location in AKQST; which means the search …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,29
Sharkdb: An in-memory column-oriented trajectory storage,Haozhou Wang; Kai Zheng; Jiajie Xu; Bolong Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou; Shazia Sadiq,Abstract The last decade has witnessed the prevalence of sensor and GPS technologies thatproduce a high volume of trajectory data representing the motion history of moving objects.However some characteristics of trajectories such as variable lengths and asynchronoussampling rates make it difficult to fit into traditional database systems that are disk-based andtuple-oriented. Motivated by the success of column store and recent development of in-memory databases; we try to explore the potential opportunities of boosting the performanceof trajectory data processing by designing a novel trajectory storage within main memory. Incontrast to most existing trajectory indexing methods that keep consecutive samples of thesame trajectory in the same disk page; we partition the database into frames in which thepositions of all moving objects at the same time instant are stored together and aligned in …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM international conference on conference on information and knowledge management,2014,29
Making sense of trajectory data: A partition-and-summarization approach,Han Su; Kai Zheng; Kai Zeng; Jiamin Huang; Shazia Sadiq; Nicholas Jing Yuan; Xiaofang Zhou,Due to the prevalence of GPS-enabled devices and wireless communication technology;spatial trajectories that describe the movement history of moving objects are beinggenerated and accumulated at an unprecedented pace. However; a raw trajectory in theform of sequence of timestamped locations does not make much sense for humans withoutsemantic representation. In this work we aim to facilitate human's understanding of a rawtrajectory by automatically generating a short text to describe it. By formulating this task asthe problem of adaptive trajectory segmentation and feature selection; we propose apartition-and-summarization framework. In the partition phase; we first define a set offeatures for each trajectory segment and then derive an optimal partition with the aim tomake the segments within each partition as homogeneous as possible in terms of their …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,26
An improved early detection method of type-2 diabetes mellitus using multiple classifier system,Jia Zhu; Qing Xie; Kai Zheng,Abstract The specific causes of complex diseases such as Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)have not yet been identified. Nevertheless; many medical science researchers believe thatcomplex diseases are caused by a combination of genetic; environmental; and lifestylefactors. Detection of such diseases becomes an issue because it is not free from falsepresumptions and is accompanied by unpredictable effects. Given the greatly increasedamount of data gathered in medical databases; data mining has been used widely in recentyears to detect and improve the diagnosis of complex diseases. However; past researchshowed that no single classifier can be considered optimal for all problems. Therefore; inthis paper; we focus on employing multiple classifier systems to improve the accuracy ofdetection for complex diseases; such as T2DM. We proposed a dynamic weighted voting …,Information Sciences,2015,26
Modeling user mobility for location promotion in location-based social networks,Wen-Yuan Zhu; Wen-Chih Peng; Ling-Jyh Chen; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract With the explosion of smartphones and social network services; location-basedsocial networks (LBSNs) are increasingly seen as tools for businesses (eg; restaurants;hotels) to promote their products and services. In this paper; we investigate the keytechniques that can help businesses promote their locations by advertising wisely throughthe underlying LBSNs. In order to maximize the benefit of location promotion; we formalize itas an influence maximization problem in an LBSN; ie; given a target location and an LBSN;which a set of k users (called seeds) should be advertised initially such that they cansuccessfully propagate and attract most other users to visit the target location. Existingstudies have proposed different ways to calculate the information propagation probability;that is how likely a user may influence another; in the settings of static social network …,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,25

Adapting to user interest drift for poi recommendation,Hongzhi Yin; Xiaofang Zhou; Bin Cui; Hao Wang; Kai Zheng; Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen,Point-of-Interest recommendation is an essential means to help people discover attractivelocations; especially when people travel out of town or to unfamiliar regions. While agrowing line of research has focused on modeling user geographical preferences for POIrecommendation; they ignore the phenomenon of user interest drift across geographicalregions; ie; users tend to have different interests when they travel in different regions; whichdiscounts the recommendation quality of existing methods; especially for out-of-town users.In this paper; we propose a latent class probabilistic generative model Spatial-TemporalLDA (ST-LDA) to learn region-dependent personal interests according to the contents oftheir checked-in POIs at each region. As the users' check-in records left in the out-of-townregions are extremely sparse; ST-LDA incorporates the crowd's preferences by …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,23
Discovery of path nearby clusters in spatial networks,Shuo Shang; Kai Zheng; Christian S Jensen; Bin Yang; Panos Kalnis; Guohe Li; Ji-Rong Wen,The discovery of regions of interest in large cities is an important challenge. We propose andinvestigate a novel query called the path nearby cluster (PNC) query that finds regions ofpotential interest (eg; sightseeing places and commercial districts) with respect to a user-specified travel route. Given a set of spatial objects O (eg; POIs; geo-tagged photos; or geo-tagged tweets) and a query route q; if a cluster c has high spatial-object density and isspatially close to q; it is returned by the query (a cluster is a circular region defined by acenter and a radius). This query aims to bring important benefits to users in popularapplications such as trip planning and location recommendation. Efficient computation of thePNC query faces two challenges: how to prune the search space during query processing;and how to identify clusters with high density effectively. To address these challenges; a …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,21
PNN query processing on compressed trajectories,Shuo Shang; Bo Yuan; Ke Deng; Kexin Xie; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Trajectory compression is widely used in spatial-temporal databases as it cannotably reduce (i) the computation/communication load of clients (GPS-enabled mobiledevices) and (ii) the storage cost of servers. Compared with original trajectories;compressed trajectories have clear advantages in data processing; transmitting; storing; etc.In this paper; we investigate a novel problem of searching the Path Nearest Neighbor basedon Compressed Trajectories (PNN-CT query). This type of query is conducted oncompressed trajectories and the target is to retrieve the PNN with the highest probability(lossy compression leads to the uncertainty); which can bring significant benefits to users inmany popular applications such as trip planning. To answer the PNN-CT query effectivelyand efficiently; a two-phase solution is proposed. First; we use the meta-data and sample …,GeoInformatica,2012,20
Spatial query processing for fuzzy objects,Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou; Pui Cheong Fung; Kexin Xie,Abstract Range and nearest neighbor queries are the most common types of spatial queries;which have been investigated extensively in the last decades due to its broad range ofapplications. In this paper; we study this problem in the context of fuzzy objects that haveindeterministic boundaries. Fuzzy objects play an important role in many areas; such asbiomedical image databases and GIS communities. Existing research on fuzzy objectsmainly focuses on modeling basic fuzzy object types and operations; leaving the processingof more advanced queries largely untouched. In this paper; we propose two new kinds ofspatial queries for fuzzy objects; namely single threshold query and continuous thresholdquery; to determine the query results which qualify at a certain probability threshold andwithin a probability interval; respectively.

Discovering interpretable geo-social communities for user behavior prediction,Hongzhi Yin; Zhiting Hu; Xiaofang Zhou; Hao Wang; Kai Zheng; Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen; Shazia Sadiq,Social community detection is a growing field of interest in the area of social networkapplications; and many approaches have been developed; including graph partitioning;latent space model; block model and spectral clustering. Most existing work purely focuseson network structure information which is; however; often sparse; noisy and lack ofinterpretability. To improve the accuracy and interpretability of community discovery; wepropose to infer users' social communities by incorporating their spatiotemporal data andsemantic information. Technically; we propose a unified probabilistic generative model; User-Community-Geo-Topic (UCGT); to simulate the generative process of communities as aresult of network proximities; spatiotemporal co-occurrences and semantic similarity.

STMaker: a system to make sense of trajectory data,Han Su; Kai Zheng; Kai Zeng; Jiamin Huang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Widely adoption of GPS-enabled devices generates large amounts of trajectoriesevery day. The raw trajectory data describes the movement history of moving objects by asequence of< longitude; latitude; time-stamp> triples; which are nonintuitive for human toperceive the prominent features of the trajectory; such as where and how the moving objecttravels. In this demo; we present the STMaker system to help users make sense of individualtrajectories. Given a trajectory; STMaker can automatically extract the significant semanticbehavior of the trajectory; and summarize the behavior by a short human-readable text. Inthis paper; we first introduce the phrases of generating trajectory summarizations; and thenshow several real trajectory summarization cases.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,17
Discovering the Most Influential Sites over Uncertain Data: A Rank Based Approach,Kai Zheng; Zi Huang; X Zhou,With the rapidly increasing availability of uncertain data in many important applications suchas location-based services; sensor monitoring; and biological information managementsystems; uncertainty-aware query processing has received a significant amount of researcheffort from the database community in recent years. In this paper; we investigate a new typeof query in the context of uncertain databases; namely uncertain top-k influential sites query(UTkIS query for short); which can be applied in a wide range of application areas such asmarketing analysis and mobile services. Since it is not so straightforward to precisely definethe semantics of top-k query with uncertain data; in this paper we introduce a novel andmore intuitive formulation of the query on the basis of expected rank semantics.

In this paper; by leveraging users'historical dining pattern; socio-demographic characteristics and restaurants' attributes; weaim at generating the top-K restaurants for a user's next dining. Compared to previousstudies in location prediction which mainly focus on regular mobility patterns; we present anovelty-seeking based dining recommender system; termed NDRS; in consideration of bothexploration and exploitation.

Graph-based clustering and ranking for diversified image search,Yan Yan; Gaowen Liu; Sen Wang; Jian Zhang; Kai Zheng,Abstract In this paper; we consider the problem of clustering and re-ranking web imagesearch results so as to improve diversity at high ranks. We propose a novel rankingframework; namely cluster-constrained conditional Markov random walk (CCCMRW); whichhas two key steps: first; cluster images into topics; and then perform Markov random walk inan image graph conditioned on constraints of image cluster information. In order to clusterthe retrieval results of web images; a novel graph clustering model is proposed in this paper.We explore the surrounding text to mine the correlations between words and images andtherefore the correlations are used to improve clustering results. Two kinds of correlations;namely word to image and word to word correlations; are mainly considered.

Planning unobstructed paths in traffic-aware spatial networks,Shuo Shang; Jiajun Liu; Kai Zheng; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen; Ji-Rong Wen,Abstract Route planning and recommendation have received significant attention in recentyears. In this light; we study a novel problem of planning unobstructed paths in traffic-awarespatial networks (TAUP queries) to avoid potential traffic congestions. We propose twoprobabilistic TAUP queries:(1) a time-threshold query like “what is the path from the check-indesk to the flight SK 1217 with the minimum congestion probability to take at most 45minutes?”; and (2) a probability-threshold query like “what is the fastest path from the check-in desk to the flight SK 1217 whose congestion probability is less than 20%?”. These queriesare mainly motivated by indoor space applications; but are also applicable in outdoorspaces. We believe that these queries are useful in some popular applications; such asplanning unobstructed paths for VIP bags in airports and planning convenient routes for …,GeoInformatica,2015,13
Trust Prediction with Propagation and Similarity Regularization.,Xiaoming Zheng; Yan Wang; Mehmet A Orgun; Youliang Zhong; Guanfeng Liu,Abstract Online social networks have been used for a variety of rich activities in recent years;such as investigating potential employees and seeking recommendations of high qualityservices and service providers. In such activities; trust is one of the most critical factors forthe decisionmaking of users. In the literature; the state-of-the-art trust prediction approachesfocus on either dispositional trust tendency and propagated trust of the pair-wise trustrelationships along a path or the similarity of trust rating values. However; there are otherinfluential factors that should be taken into account; such as the similarity of the trust ratingdistributions. In addition; tendency; propagated trust and similarity are of different types; aseither personal properties or interpersonal properties. But the difference has been neglectedin existing models. Therefore; in trust prediction; it is necessary to take all the above …,AAAI,2014,13
Multi-constrained graph pattern matching in large-scale contextual social graphs,Guanfeng Liu; Kai Zheng; Yan Wang; Mehmet A Orgun; An Liu; Lei Zhao; Xiaofang Zhou,Graph Pattern Matching (GPM) plays a significant role in social network analysis; which hasbeen widely used in; for example; experts finding; social community mining and socialposition detection. Given a pattern graph GQ and a data graph GD; a GPM algorithm findsthose subgraphs; GM; that match GQ in G D. However; the existing GPM methods do notconsider the multiple constraints on edges in GQ; which are commonly exist in variousapplications such as; crowdsourcing travel; social network based e-commerce and studygroup selection; etc. In this paper; we first conceptually extend Bounded Simulation to Multi-Constrained Simulation (MCS); and propose a novel NP-Complete Multi-Constrained GraphPattern Matching (MC-GPM) problem.

Finding alternative shortest paths in spatial networks,Kexin Xie; Ke Deng; Shuo Shang; Xiaofang Zhou; Kai Zheng,Abstract Shortest path query is one of the most fundamental queries in spatial networkdatabases. There exist algorithms that can process shortest path queries in real time.However; many complex applications require more than just the calculation of a singleshortest path. For example; one of the common ways to determine the importance (or price)of a vertex or an edge in spatial network is to use Vickrey pricing; which intuitively values thevertex v (or edge e) based on how much harder for travelling from the sources to thedestinations without using v (or e). In such cases; the alternative shortest paths without usingv (or e) are required. In this article; we propose using a precomputation based approach forboth single pair alternative shortest path and all pairs shortest paths processing.

Exploiting dining preference for restaurant recommendation,Fuzheng Zhang; Nicholas Jing Yuan; Kai Zheng; Defu Lian; Xing Xie; Yong Rui,Abstract The wide adoption of location-based services provide the potential to understandpeople's mobility pattern at an unprecedented level; which can also enable food-serviceindustry to accurately predict consumers' dining behavior. In this paper; based on users'dining implicit feedbacks (restaurant visit via check-ins); explicit feedbacks (restaurantreviews) as well as some meta data (eg; location; user demographics; restaurant attributes);we aim at recommending each user a list of restaurants for his next dining. Implicit andExplicit feedbacks of dining behavior exhibit different characteristics of user preference.Therefore; in our work; user's dining preference mainly contains two parts: implicitpreference coming from check-in data (implicit feedbacks) and explicit preference comingfrom rating and review data (explicit feedbacks). For implicit preference; we first apply a …,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web,2016,11
Sharkdb: An in-memory storage system for massive trajectory data,Haozhou Wang; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou; Shazia Sadiq,Abstract An increasing amount of motion history data; which is called trajectory; is beingcollected from different sources such as GPS-enabled mobile devices; surveillance camerasand social networks. However it is hard to store and manage trajectory data in traditionaldatabase systems; since its variable lengths and asynchronous sampling rates do not fit disk-based and tuple-oriented structures; which are the fundamental structures of traditionaldatabase systems. We implement a novel trajectory storage system that is motivated by thesuccess of column store and recent development of in-memory based databases. In thisstorage design; we try to explore the potential opportunities; which can boost theperformance of query processing for trajectory data.

Microblog entity linking with social temporal context,Wen Hua; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Nowadays microblogging sites; such as Twitter and Chinese Sina Weibo; haveestablished themselves as an invaluable information source; which provides a hugecollection of manually-generated tweets with broad range of topics from daily life to breakingnews. Entity linking is indispensable for understanding and maintaining such information;which in turn facilitates many real-world applications such as tweet clustering andclassification; personalized microblog search; and so forth. However; tweets are short;informal and error-prone; rendering traditional approaches for entity linking in documentslargely inapplicable. Recent work addresses this problem by utilising information from othertweets and linking entities in a batch manner. Nevertheless; the high computationalcomplexity makes this approach infeasible for real-time applications given the high arrival …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,11
Modeling the dynamic trust of online service providers using HMM,Xiaoming Zheng; Yan Wang; Mehmet A Orgun,Online trading takes place in a very complex environment full of uncertainty in whichdeceitful service providers or sellers may strategically change their behaviors to maximizetheir profits. The proliferation of deception cases makes it essential and challenging tomodel the dynamics of a service provider and predict the trustworthiness of the serviceprovider in transactions. Recently; probabilistic trust models have been used to assistdecision making in computing environments. Although the typical Hidden Markov Model(HMM) has been used to model a provider's behavior dynamics; existing approaches focusonly on the outcomes or ignore the hidden characteristics of the HMM model. In this paper;we model the dynamic trust of service providers concerning a forthcoming transaction in lightof as much information as we can consider; including the static features; such as the …,Web Services (ICWS); 2013 IEEE 20th International Conference on,2013,11
Finding regions of interest using location based social media,Shuo Shang; Danhuai Guo; Jiajun Liu; Kai Zheng; Ji-Rong Wen,Abstract The discovery of regions of interest in city groups is increasingly important in recentyears. In this light; we propose and investigate a novel problem called Region Discoveryquery (RD query) that finds regions of interest with respect to a user׳ s current geographiclocation. Given a set of spatial objects O and a query location q; if a circular region ω is withhigh spatial-object density and is spatially close to q; it is returned by the query and isrecommended to users. This type of query can bring significant benefit to users in manyuseful applications such as trip planning and region recommendation. The RD query faces abig challenge: how to prune the search space in the spatial and density domains. Toovercome the challenge and process the RD query efficiently; we propose a novelcollaboration search method and we define a pair of bounds to prune the search space …,Neurocomputing,2016,9
Keyword-aware continuous knn query on road networks,Bolong Zheng; Kai Zheng; Xiaokui Xiao; Han Su; Hongzhi Yin; Xiaofang Zhou; Guohui Li,It is nowadays quite common for road networks to have textual contents on the vertices;which describe auxiliary information (eg; business; traffic; etc.) associated with the vertex. Insuch road networks; which are modelled as weighted undirected graphs; each vertex isassociated with one or more keywords; and each edge is assigned with a weight; which canbe its physical length or travelling time. In this paper; we study the problem of keyword-aware continuous k nearest neighbour (KCkNN) search on road networks; which computesthe k nearest vertices that contain the query keywords issued by a moving object andmaintains the results continuously as the object is moving on the road network. Reducingthe query processing costs in terms of computation and communication has attractedconsiderable attention in the database community with interesting techniques proposed …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,8
Understand short texts by harvesting and analyzing semantic knowledge,Wen Hua; Zhongyuan Wang; Haixun Wang; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,Understanding short texts is crucial to many applications; but challenges abound. First; shorttexts do not always observe the syntax of a written language. As a result; traditional naturallanguage processing tools; ranging from part-of-speech tagging to dependency parsing;cannot be easily applied. Second; short texts usually do not contain sufficient statisticalsignals to support many state-of-the-art approaches for text mining such as topic modeling.Third; short texts are more ambiguous and noisy; and are generated in an enormousvolume; which further increases the difficulty to handle them. We argue that semanticknowledge is required in order to better understand short texts. In this work; we build aprototype system for short text understanding which exploits semantic knowledge providedby a well-known knowledgebase and automatically harvested from a web corpus.

Multi-view ensemble learning for dementia diagnosis from neuroimaging: an artificial neural network approach,Jiajun Liu; Shuo Shang; Kai Zheng; Ji-Rong Wen,Abstract Identifying abnormalities from neuroimaging of brain matters has been a crucialway of diagnosis of two closely associated diseases; namely Alzheimer׳ s Disease (AD) andMild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Different types of neuroimaging have been developed tohelp such diagnosis; and significant research efforts are put into the automation andquantification of such diagnosis by computer algorithms over the past decades. In this paperwe propose an ensemble learning framework to create effective models for AD/MCI relatedclassification tasks from multiple modalities of neuroimaging and multiple baselineestimators. The framework is based on artificial neural networks and it resembles acomposite model that solves the feature fusion learning problem as well as the predictionproblem simultaneously; which targets at exploiting the prediction power of both fusing …,Neurocomputing,2016,6
Ranking based activity trajectory search,Wei Chen; Lei Zhao; Xu Jiajie; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract With the proliferation of the GPS-enabled devices and mobile techniques; there hasbeen a lot of work on trajectory search in the last decade. Previous trajectory search hasfocused on spatio-temporal features and text descriptions. Different from them; we study anovel problem of searching trajectories with activities and corresponding rankinginformation. Given a query q; which is attached with a set of activities and a threshold ofdistance; the results of ranking based activity trajectory search (RTS) are k trajectories suchthat the given activities are performed with the highest ranking within the threshold ofdistance. In addition; we also extend the query with an order; ie; order-sensitive rankingbased activity trajectory search (ORTS); which takes both the order of activities in a query qand the order of trajectories into account. It is challenging to answer RTS and ORTS …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2014,6
Compressing large scale urban trajectory data,Kuien Liu; Yaguang Li; Jian Dai; Shuo Shang; Kai Zheng,Abstract With the increasing size of trajectory data generated by location-based services andapplications which are built from inexpensive GPS-enabled devices in urban environments;the need for compressing large scale trajectories becomes obvious. This paper proposes ascalable urban trajectory compression scheme (SUTC) that can compress a set oftrajectories collectively by exploiting common movement behaviors among the urbanmoving objects such as vehicles and smartphone users. SUTC exploits that urban objectsmoving in similar behaviors naturally; especially large-scale of human and vehicle which aremoving constrained by some geographic context (eg; road networks or routes). To exploitredundancy across a large set of trajectories; SUTC first transforms trajectory sequencesfrom Euclidean space to network-constrained space and represents each trajectory with a …,Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Cloud Data and Platforms,2014,6
Exploiting viral marketing for location promotion in location-based social networks,Wen-Yuan Zhu; Wen-Chih Peng; Ling-Jyh Chen; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract With the explosion of smartphones and social network services; location-basedsocial networks (LBSNs) are increasingly seen as tools for businesses (eg; restaurants andhotels) to promote their products and services. In this article; we investigate the keytechniques that can help businesses promote their locations by advertising wisely throughthe underlying LBSNs. In order to maximize the benefit of location promotion; we formalize itas an influence maximization problem in an LBSN; ie; given a target location and an LBSN;a set of k users (called seeds) should be advertised initially such that they can successfullypropagate and attract many other users to visit the target location. Existing studies haveproposed different ways to calculate the information propagation probability; that is; howlikely it is that a user may influence another; in the setting of a static social network …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2016,5
Graph-based analysis of city-wide traffic dynamics using time-evolving graphs of trajectory data,Jiwon Kim; Kai Zheng; Sanghyung Ahn; Marty Papamanolis; Pingfu Chao,Abstract This paper proposes a graph-based approach to representing spatio-temporaltrajectory data that allows an effective visualization and characterization of city-wide trafficdynamics. With the advance of sensor; mobile; and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies;vehicle and passenger trajectories are increasingly being collected in massive scale andare becoming a critical source of insight into traffic pattern and traveller behaviour. Toleverage such trajectory data to better understand traffic dynamics in a large-scale urbannetwork; this study develops a trajectory-based network traffic analysis method that convertsindividual trajectory data into a sequence of graphs that evolve over time (known as dynamicgraphs or time-evolving graphs) and analyses network-wide traffic patterns in terms of acompact and informative graph-representation of aggregated traffic flows.

Spatial and temporal scoring for egocentric video summarization,Zhao Guo; Lianli Gao; Xiantong Zhen; Fuhao Zou; Fumin Shen; Kai Zheng,Abstract We present a summarization approach for egocentric video. Given hours of video;the proposed method produces a compact storyboard summary of the camera wearer's day.In contrast to traditional keyframe selection techniques; the resulting summary focuses onthe most important video shots which reflect high stable salience; discrimination andrepresentativeness. To accomplish this; we utilize egocentric salience cues; motion cuesand a selection model to capture stable salience weight; discriminative weight andrepresentative weight of a video shot respectively. We further combine these weights in aunified framework to predict the importance score of a shot; based on which; important shotsare selected for the storyboard. Critically; the approach is neither camera-wearer-specificnor object-specific; that means the learned importance metric need not be trained for a …,Neurocomputing,2016,5
Binet: Trust sub-network extraction using binary ant colony algorithm in contextual social networks,Xiaoming Zheng; Yan Wang; Mehmet A Orgun,Online Social Networks (OSNs) have become an integral part of daily life in recent years.OSNs contain important participants; the trust relations between participants; and thecontexts in which participants interact with each other. All of these have a great influence onthe prediction of the trust between a source participant and a target participant; which isimportant for a participant's decision-making process in many applications; such as seekingservice providers. However; predicting the trust from a source participant to a target onebased on the whole social network is not really feasible. Thus; prior to trust prediction; theextraction of a small-scale sub-network containing most of the important nodes andcontextual information with a high density rate could make trust prediction more efficient andeffective. However; extracting such a sub-network has been proved to be an NP …,Web Services (ICWS); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,5
Social context-aware trust prediction in social networks,Xiaoming Zheng; Yan Wang; Mehmet A Orgun; Guanfeng Liu; Haibin Zhang,Abstract Online social networks have been widely used for a large number of activities inrecent years. Utilizing social network information to infer or predict trust among people torecommend services from trustworthy providers have drawn growing attention; especially inonline environments. Conventional trust inference approaches predict trust between peoplealong paths connecting them in social networks. However; most of the state-of-the-art trustprediction approaches do not consider the contextual information that influences trust andtrust evaluation. In this paper; we first analyze the personal properties and interpersonalproperties which impact trust transference between contexts. Then; a new trust transferencemethod is proposed to predict the trust in a target context from that in different but relevantcontexts. Next; a social context-aware trust prediction model based on matrix factorization …,International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing,2014,5
Efficient retrieval of top-k most similar users from travel smart card data,Bolong Zheng; Kai Zheng; Mohamed A Sharaf; Xiaofang Zhou; Shazia Sadiq,Understanding the dynamics of human daily mobility patterns is essential for themanagement and planning of urban facilities and services. Travel smart cards; which recordusers' public transporting histories; capture rich information of users' mobility pattern. Thisprovides the opportunity to discover valuable knowledge from these transaction records. Inrecent years; research on measuring user similarity for behavior analysis has attracted a lotof attention in applications such as recommendation systems; crowd behavior analysisapplications; and numerous data mining tasks. In this paper; our goal is to estimate thesimilarity between users' travel patterns according to their travel smart card data.

A crowd-based route recommendation system-crowdplanner,Han Su; Kai Zheng; Jiamin Huang; Tianyu Liu; Haozhou Wang; Xiaofang Zhou,Route recommendation service has become a big business in industry since traveling isnow an important part of our daily life. We can travel to unknown places by simply typing inour destination and then following recommendation service's guidance; that a pleasant tripdesires them to provide a good route. However; previous research shows that even theroutes recommended by the big-thumb service providers can deviate significantly from theroutes travelled by experienced drivers since the many latent factors affect drivers'preferences and it is hard for a single route recommendation algorithm to model all of them.In this demo we will present the CrowPlanner system to leverage crowds' knowledge toimprove the recommendation quality.

Semantic-aware query processing for activity trajectories,Huiwen Liu; Jiajie Xu; Kai Zheng; Chengfei Liu; Lan Du; Xian Wu,Abstract Nowadays; users of social networks like tweets and weibo have generated massivegeo-tagged records; and these records reveal their activities in the physical world togetherwith spatio-temporal dynamics. Existing trajectory data management studies mainly focus onanalyzing the spatio-temporal properties of trajectories; while leaving the understanding oftheir activities largely untouched. In this paper; we incorporate the semantic analysis of theactivity information embedded in trajectories into query modelling and processing; with theaim of providing end users more accurate and meaningful trip recommendations. To thisend; we propose a novel trajectory query that not only considers the spatio-temporalcloseness but also; more importantly; leverages probabilistic topic modelling to capture thesemantic relevance of the activities between data and query.

Category co-occurrence modeling for large scale scene recognition,Xinhang Song; Shuqiang Jiang; Luis Herranz; Yan Kong; Kai Zheng,Abstract Scene recognition involves complex reasoning from low-level local features to high-level scene categories. The large semantic gap motivates that most methods model scenesresorting to mid-level representations (eg objects; topics). However; this implies anadditional mid-level vocabulary and has implications in training and inference. In contrast;the semantic multinomial (SMN) represents patches directly in the scene-level semanticspace; which leads to ambiguity when aggregated to a global image representation.Fortunately; this ambiguity appears in the form of scene category co-occurrences which canbe modeled a posteriori with a classifier. In this paper we observe that these patterns areessentially local rather than global; sparse; and consistent across SMNs obtained frommultiple visual features. We propose a co-occurrence modeling framework where we …,Pattern Recognition,2016,4
Efficient query processing with mutual privacy protection for location-based services,Shushu Liu; An Liu; Lei Zhao; Guanfeng Liu; Zhixu Li; Pengpeng Zhao; Kai Zheng; Lu Qin,Abstract Data privacy in location-based services involves two aspects. The location of a useris a kind of private data as many sensitive information can be inferred from it given somebackground knowledge. On the other hand; the POI database is a great asset to the LBSprovider as its construction requires many resources and efforts. In this paper; we propose amethod of protecting mutual privacy (ie; the location of the user issuing a query and the POIdatabase of the LBS provider) for location-based query processing. Our approach consistsof two steps: data preparation and query processing. Data preparation is conducted by LBSitself and is totally an offline computation; while query processing involves some onlinecomputation and multiple rounds of communication between LBS and the user. Weimplement the query processing by two rounds of oblivious transfer extension (OT …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2016,4
GFilter: A General Gram Filter for String Similarity Search,Haoji Hu; Kai Zheng; Xiaoling Wang; Aoying Zhou,Numerous applications such as data integration; protein detection; and article copydetection share a similar core problem: given a string as the query; how to efficiently find allthe similar answers from a large scale string collection. Many existing methods adopt aprefix-filter-based framework to solve this problem; and a number of recent works aim to useadvanced filters to improve the overall search performance. In this paper; we propose agram-based framework to achieve near maximum filter performance. The main idea is tojudiciously choose the high-quality grams as the prefix of query according to their estimatedability to filter candidates. As this selection process is proved to be NP-hard problem; wegive a cost model to measure the filter ability of grams and develop efficient heuristicalgorithms to find high-quality grams.

Cost-efficient spatial network partitioning for distance-based query processing,Jiping Wang; Kai Zheng; Hoyoung Jeung; Haozhou Wang; Bolong Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,The efficiency of spatial query processing is crucial for many applications such as location-based services. In spatial networks; queries like k-NN queries are all based on networkdistance evaluation. Classic solutions for these queries rely on network expansion and arenot efficient enough for large networks. Some approaches have improved the queryefficiency but brought considerable space cost for index. To address these problems; wepropose a hierarchical graph partitioning based index named Partition Tree. It organizes thevertices of a spatial network into a hierarchy through a series of graph partitioningprocesses. Meanwhile precomputed distances are associated with this hierarchy to facilitateefficient query processing. Inspired by the observation that queries are usually invokedaround objects of interest; we propose a query-oriented optimization on top of the …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2014 IEEE 15th International Conference on,2014,4
Popularity-aware spatial keyword search on activity trajectories,Kai Zheng; Bolong Zheng; Jiajie Xu; Guanfeng Liu; An Liu; Zhixu Li,Abstract The proliferation of GPS-enabled smart mobile devices enables us to collect a large-scale trajectories of moving objects with GPS tags. While the raw trajectories that onlyconsists of positional information have been studied extensively; many recent works havebeen focusing on enriching the raw trajectories with semantic knowledge. The resultingdata; called activity trajectories; embed the information about behaviors of the movingobjects and support a variety of applications for better quality of services. In this paper; wepropose a Top-k Spatial Keyword (T k SK) query for activity trajectories; with the objective tofind a set of trajectories that are not only close geographically but also meet therequirements of the query semantically. Such kind of query can deliver more informativeresults than existing spatial keyword queries for static objects; since activity trajectories …,World Wide Web,2017,3

The interaction between schema matching and record matching in data integration,Binbin Gu; Zhixu Li; Xiangliang Zhang; An Liu; Guanfeng Liu; Kai Zheng; Lei Zhao; Xiaofang Zhou,Schema Matching (SM) and Record Matching (RM) are two necessary steps in integratingmultiple relational tables of different schemas; where SM unifies the schemas and RMdetects records referring to the same real-world entity. The two processes have beenthoroughly studied separately; but few attention has been paid to the interaction of SM andRM. In this work; we find that; even alternating them in a simple manner; SM and RM canbenefit from each other to reach a better integration performance (ie; in terms of precisionand recall). Therefore; combining SM and RM is a promising solution for improving dataintegration. To this end; we define novel matching rules for SM and RM; respectively; that is;every SM decision is made based on intermediate RM results; and vice versa; such that SMand RM can be performed alternately. The quality of integration is guaranteed by a …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,3
TOSI: a trust-oriented social influence evaluation method in contextual social networks,Guanfeng Liu; Feng Zhu; Kai Zheng; An Liu; Zhixu Li; Lei Zhao; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Online Social Networks (OSNs) have been used as the means for a variety ofapplications. For example; social networking platform has been used in employment system;e-Commerce and CRM system to improve the quality of recommendations with theassistance of social networks. In these applications; social influence acts as a significantrole; affecting people's decision-making. However; the existing social influence evaluationmethods do not fully consider the social contexts; ie; the social relationships and the socialtrust between participants; and the preferences of participants; which have significant impacton social influence evaluation in OSNs. Thus; these existing methods cannot deliveraccurate social influence evaluation results.

On efficient spatial keyword querying with semantics,Zhihu Qian; Jiajie Xu; Kai Zheng; Wei Sun; Zhixu Li; Haoming Guo,Abstract The fast development of GPS equipped devices has aroused widespread use ofspatial keyword querying in location based services nowadays. Existing spatial keywordindexing and querying methodologies mainly focus on the spatial and textual similarities;while leaving the semantic understanding of keywords in spatial web objects and queries tobe ignored. To address this issue; this paper studies the problem of semantic based spatialkeyword querying. It seeks to return the k objects most similar to the query; subject to notonly their spatial and textual properties; but also the coherence of their semantic meanings.To achieve that; we propose a novel indexing structure called NIQ-tree; which integratesspatial; textual and semantic information in a hierarchical manner; so as to prune the searchspace effectively in query processing.

Dimension reduction with meta object-groups for efficient image retrieval,Shuo Shang; Jiajun Liu; Kun Zhao; Mingrui Yang; Kai Zheng; Ji-rong Wen,Abstract Bag-of-Word (BoW) has been a prominent form for representing visual content suchas image and video in recent years; as a result of its unique capability of characterizingvisual content in a picture-level while still preserving part of the object-level information.However; it is also noticed that the dimensionality of BoW is usually as high as a fewhundreds or even thousands; posing a serious challenge for any application that requiresefficient processing. In this paper we propose a dimension reduction method called Metaobject-Group Component (MGC) to tackle this problem. MGC aims at discovering the hiddenrelations of objects by examining the correlations between dimensions in the BoW featuresand maximizing the relations of the members in a meta object-group. By exchangingmessage passing between object-groups; meta object-groups are identified for a dataset …,Neurocomputing,2015,3
Contextual Sub-network Extraction in Contextual Social Networks,Xiaoming Zheng; Yan Wang; Mehmet A Orgun,Predicting the trust between a source participant and a target participant in a social networkis important in many applications; eg; assessing the recommendation from a targetparticipant from the perspective of a source participant. In general; social networks containparticipants; the links and trust relations between them and the contextual information fortheir interactions. All such information has important influence on trust prediction. However;predicting the trust between two participants based on the whole network is ineffective andinefficient. Thus; prior to trust prediction; it is necessary to extract a small-scale contextualnetwork that contains most of the important participants as well as trust and contextualinformation. However; extracting such a sub-network has been proved to be an NP-Complete problem. To solve this challenging problem; we propose a social context-aware …,Trustcom/BigDataSE/ISPA; 2015 IEEE,2015,3
Trip oriented search on activity trajectory,Wei Chen; Lei Zhao; Jia-Jie Xu; Guan-Feng Liu; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Driven by the flourish of location-based services; trajectory search has receivedsignificant attentions in recent years. Different from existing studies that focus on searchingtrajectories with spatio-temporal information and text de-scriptions; we study a novelproblem of searching trajectories with spatial distance; activities; and rating scores. Given aquery q with a threshold of distance; a set of activities; a start point S and a destination E; triporiented search on activity trajectory (TOSAT) returns k trajectories that can cover theactivities with the highest rating scores within the threshold of distance. In addition; weextend the query with an order; ie; order-sensitive trip oriented search on activity trajectory(OTOSAT); which takes both the order of activities in a query q and the order of trajectoriesinto consideration.

VID join: Mapping trajectories to points of interest to support location-based services,Shuo Shang; Kexin Xie; Kai Zheng; Jiajun Liu; Ji-Rong Wen,Abstract Variable influence duration (VID) join is a novel spatio-temporal join operationbetween a set T of trajectories and a set P of spatial points. Here; trajectories are travelinghistories of moving objects (eg; travelers); and spatial points are points of interest (POIs; eg;restaurants). VID join returns all pairs of (τ s; p) if τ s is spatially close to p for a long period oftime; where τ s is a segment of trajectory τ∈ T and p∈ P. Each returned (τ s; p) implies thatthe moving object associated with τ s stayed at p (eg; having dinner at a restaurant). Suchinformation is useful in many aspects; such as targeted advertising; social security; andsocial activity analysis. The concepts of influence and influence duration are introduced tomeasure the spatial closeness between τ and p; and the time spanned; respectively.Compared to the conventional spatio-temporal join; the VID join is more challenging …,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2015,3
An efficient method to find the optimal social trust path in contextual social graphs,Guanfeng Liu; Lei Zhao; Kai Zheng; An Liu; Jiajie Xu; Zhixu Li; Athman Bouguettaya,Abstract Online Social Networks (OSN) have been used as platforms for many emergingapplications; where trust is a critical factor for participants' decision making. In order toevaluate the trustworthiness between two unknown participants; we need to perform trustinference along the social trust paths formed by the interactions among the intermediateparticipants. However; there are usually a large number of social trust paths between twoparticipants. Thus; a challenging problem is how to effectively and efficiently find the optimalsocial trust path that can yield the most trustworthy evaluation result based on therequirements of participants. In this paper; the core problem of finding the optimal social trustpath with multiple constraints of social contexts is modelled as the classical NP-CompleteMulti-Constrained Optimal Path (MCOP) selection problem.

CSky: an online efficient algorithm for subspace skyline computation in high dimensional space,Hongfu Zhou; Xueqing Gong; Kai Zheng; Aoying Zhou,Abstract Skyline computation aims to find the points that are not dominated by any otherpoint in the dataset. It has been becoming a hot topic due to its potential applications in real-time online services. Usually; such applications expect to return the first Skyline pointquickly; without ransacking all the points. This paper focuses on the problem of progressivesubspace Skyline queries in high dimensional space. To the best of our knowledge; theexisting algorithms and their variations cannot be easily extended to support arbitrarysubspace Skyline query efficiently. The BNL (Blocked Nested Loop) method can be used forsubspace Skyline queries; but it is very inefficiently; and not progressive.

Efficient clue-based route search on road networks,Bolong Zheng; Han Su; Wen Hua; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou; Guohui Li,With the advances in geo-positioning technologies and location-based services; it isnowadays quite common for road networks to have textual contents on the vertices. Previouswork on identifying an optimal route that covers a sequence of query keywords has beenstudied in recent years. However; in many practical scenarios; an optimal route might notalways be desirable. For example; a personalized route query is issued by providing someclues that describe the spatial context between PoIs along the route; where the result can befar from the optimal one. Therefore; in this paper; we investigate the problem of clue-basedroute search (${\sf {CRS}} $); which allows a user to provide clues on keywords and spatialrelationships. First; we propose a greedy algorithm and a dynamic programming algorithmas baselines. To improve efficiency; we develop a branch-and-bound algorithm that …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,2
Ranking weighted clustering coefficient in large dynamic graphs,Xuefei Li; Lijun Chang; Kai Zheng; Zi Huang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Efficiently searching top-k representative vertices is crucial for understanding thestructure of large dynamic graphs. Recent studies show that communities formed by a vertexwith high local clustering coefficient and its neighbours can achieve enhanced informationpropagation speed as well as disease transmission speed. However; local clusteringcoefficient; which measures the cliquishness of a vertex in its local neighbourhood; prefersvertices with small degrees. To remedy this issue; in this paper we propose a new rankingmeasure; weighted clustering coefficient (WCC) of vertices; by integrating both localclustering coefficient and degree. WCC not only inherits the properties of local clusteringcoefficient but also approximately measures the density (ie; average degree) of itsneighbourhood subgraph. Thus; vertices with higher WCC are more likely to be …,World Wide Web,2017,2
Trajectory similarity join in spatial networks,Shuo Shang; Lisi Chen; Zhewei Wei; Christian S Jensen; Kai Zheng; Panos Kalnis,Abstract The matching of similar pairs of objects; called similarity join; is fundamentalfunctionality in data management. We consider the case of trajectory similarity join (TS-Join);where the objects are trajectories of vehicles moving in road networks. Thus; given two setsof trajectories and a threshold θ; the TS-Join returns all pairs of trajectories from the two setswith similarity above θ. This join targets applications such as trajectory near-duplicatedetection; data cleaning; ridesharing recommendation; and traffic congestion prediction.With these applications in mind; we provide a purposeful definition of similarity. To enableefficient TS-Join processing on large sets of trajectories; we develop search space pruningtechniques and take into account the parallel processing capabilities of modern processors.Specifically; we present a two-phase divide-and-conquer algorithm.

Due to the significant differences in both physicaland logical designs; these two systems show totally different characteristics on massive dataanalytic workload. In order to address the difference and technical reasons behind; wecontrast the performance between disk-based data warehousing and in-memory databasesystems by comparing two state-of-the-art commercial systems using a large-scale realtransportation dataset.

PerNav: A route summarization framework for personalized navigation,Yaguang Li; Han Su; Ugur Demiryurek; Bolong Zheng; Kai Zeng; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract In this paper; we study a route summarization framework for PersonalizedNavigation dubbed PerNav-with which the goal is to generate more intuitive and customizedturn-by-turn directions based on user generated content. The turn-by-turn directionsprovided in the existing navigation applications are exclusively derived from underlying roadnetwork topology information ie; the connectivity of nodes to each other. Therefore; the turn-by-turn directions are simplified as metric translation of physical world (eg distance/time toturn) to spoken language. Such translation-that ignores human cognition about thegeographic space-is often verbose and redundant for the drivers who have knowledgeabout the geographical areas.

Given a pair ofuser-specified origin and destination; a route recommendation service aims to provide userswith the routes of the best travelling experience according to given criteria. However; eventhe routes recommended by the big-thumb service providers can deviate significantly fromthe ones travelled by experienced drivers; which motivates the previous research thatleverages crowds' knowledge to improve the recommendation quality. Since routerecommendation is normally an online task; low-latency response to drivers' queries isrequired in this kind of systems. Unfortunately; latency of crowdsourced systems is usuallyhigh; because they need to generate tasks and wait for workers' feedbacks before …,Data Science and Engineering,2016,2
Discovering neighborhood pattern queries by sample answers in knowledge base,Jialong Han; Kai Zheng; Aixin Sun; Shuo Shang; Ji-Rong Wen,Knowledge bases have shown their effectiveness in facilitating services like Web searchand question-answering. Nevertheless; it remains challenging for ordinary users to fullyunderstand the structure of a knowledge base and to issue structural queries. In manycases; users may have a natural language question and also know some popular (but notall) entities as sample answers. In this paper; we study the Reverse top-k NeighborhoodPattern Query problem; with the aim of discovering structural queries of the question basedon:(i) the structure of the knowledge base; and (ii) the sample answers of the question. Theproposed solution contains two phases: filter and refine. In the filter phase; a search space ofcandidate queries is systematically explored. The invalid queries whose result sets do notfully cover the sample answers are filtered out. In the refine phase; all surviving queries …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,2
KPMCF: A learning model for measuring social relationship strength,Youliang Zhong; Xiaoming Zheng; Jian Yang; Mehmet A Orgun; Yan Wang,Social relationship strength is one of the most important research topics in social networkanalysis; measuring how strong or weak the relationships are among the users in a socialnetwork. In particular; a theory named “The Strength of Weak Ties” was initially introduced in[1]; whereas a quantitative measurement using multiple indicator techniques was explored in[3]. While social networking services on the web are getting increasingly popular in recentyears; social relationships have significantly changed from those in the old days. Firstly; it becomesnormal for a user to have hundreds or even thousands of “friends” in social networks. Theso-called “friends” in the virtual space range from actual close friends to casual acquaintanceson the web [6]. Furthermore; it is even possible to obtain not only users' interaction data but alsousers' profile information through social networks. These changes bring greater …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2013,2
SharkDB: an in-memory column-oriented storage for trajectory analysis,Bolong Zheng; Haozhou Wang; Kai Zheng; Han Su; Kuien Liu; Shuo Shang,Abstract The last decade has witnessed the prevalence of sensor and GPS technologies thatproduce a high volume of trajectory data representing the motion history of moving objects.However some characteristics of trajectories such as variable lengths and asynchronoussampling rates make it difficult to fit into traditional database systems that are disk-based andtuple-oriented. Motivated by the success of column store and recent development of in-memory databases; we try to explore the potential opportunities of boosting the performanceof trajectory data processing by designing a novel trajectory storage within main memory. Incontrast to most existing trajectory indexing methods that keep consecutive samples of thesame trajectory in the same disk page; we partition the database into frames in which thepositions of all moving objects at the same time instant are stored together and aligned in …,World Wide Web,2018,1
A context-aware approach for trustworthy worker selection in social crowd,Yang Zhao; Guanfeng Liu; Kai Zheng; An Liu; Zhixu Li; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Crowdsourcing applications like Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) make it possibleto address many difficult tasks (eg; image tagging and sentiment analysis) on the internetand make full use of the wisdom of crowd; where worker quality is one of the most crucialissues for the task owners. Thus; a challenging problem is how to effectively and efficientlyselect the high quality workers; so that the tasks online can be accomplished successfullyunder a certain budget. The existing methods on the crowd worker selection problem mainlybased on the quality measurement of the crowd workers; those who have to register on thecrowdsourcing platforms. With the connect of the OSNs and the crowdsourcing applications;the social contexts like social relationships and social trust between participants and socialpositions of participants can assist requestors to select one or a group of trustworthy …,World Wide Web,2017,1
Web-ADARE: A web-aided data repairing system,Binbin Gu; Zhixu Li; Qiang Yang; Qing Xie; An Liu; Guanfeng Liu; Kai Zheng; Xiangliang Zhang,Abstract Data repairing aims at discovering and correcting erroneous data in databases. Inthis paper; we develop Web-ADARE; an end-to-end web-aided data repairing system; toprovide a feasible way to involve the vast data sources on the Web in data repairing. Ourmain attention in developing Web-ADARE is paid on the interaction problem between web-aided repairing and rule-based repairing; in order to minimize the Web consultation costwhile reaching predefined quality requirements. The same interaction problem also exists incrowd-based methods but this is not yet formally defined and addressed. We first prove intheory that the optimal interaction scheme is not feasible to be achieved; and then proposean algorithm to identify a scheme for efficient interaction by investigating the inconsistenciesand the dependencies between values in the repairing process.

Context-aware trust network extraction in large-scale trust-oriented social networks,Guanfeng Liu; Yi Liu; An Liu; Zhixu Li; Kai Zheng; Yan Wang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract In recent years; social networking sites have been used as a means for a richvariety of activities; such as movie recommendations and product recommendations. Inorder to evaluate the trust between a truster (ie; the source) and a trustee (ie; the target) whohave no direct interaction in Online Social Networks (OSNs); the trust network between themthat contains important intermediate participants; the trust relations between the participants;and the social context; has an important influence on trust evaluation. Thus; to deliver areasonable trust evaluation result; before performing any trust evaluation (ie; trusttransitivity); the contextual trust network from a given source to a given target needs to befirst extracted from the social network; where constraints on social context should also beconsidered to guarantee the quality of the extracted networks.

While a number of achievements have beenattained on the study of improving the accuracy of collaborative QoS prediction; little workhas been done for protecting user privacy in this process. In this paper; we propose aprivacy-preserving collaborative QoS prediction framework which can protect the privatedata of users while retaining the ability of generating accurate QoS prediction. We introducedifferential privacy; a rigorous and provable privacy preserving technique; into thepreprocess of QoS data prediction.

EtherQL: A Query Layer for Blockchain System,Yang Li; Kai Zheng; Ying Yan; Qi Liu; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Blockchain-the innovation behind Bitcoin-enables people to exchange digitalmoney with complete trust; and seems to be completely transforming the way we think abouttrust. While blockchain is designed for secured; immutable funds transfer in trustless anddecentralized environment; the underlying storage of blockchain is very simple with onlylimited supports for data access. Moreover; blockchain data are highly compressed beforeflushing to hard disk; making it harder to have an insight of these valuable data set. In thiswork; we develop EtherQL; an efficient query layer for Ethereum–the most representativeopen-source blockchain system. EtherQL provides highly efficient query primitives foranalyzing blockchain data; including range queries and top-k queries; which can beintegrated with other applications with much flexibility.

Strong Social Component-Aware Trust Sub-network Extraction in Contextual Social Networks,Guanfeng Liu; Yan Wang; Mehmet A Orgun; Xiaoming Zheng; An Liu; Zhixu Li; Kai Zheng,In Online Social Networks (OSNs); the important participants; the trust relations betweenparticipants; and the interaction contexts between participants greatly impact a participant'sdecision-making in many applications; such as service provider selection andcrowdsourcing service invocation. However; predicting the trust between two unknownparticipants based on the whole large-scale social network can lead to very highcomputation costs. Thus; prior to trust prediction; extracting a small-scale sub-networkcontaining the important participants and the corresponding contextual information with ahigh density could make the trust prediction more efficient and effective. However; extractingsuch a sub-network has been proved to be an NP-Complete problem. To address thischallenging problem; we propose a strong social component-aware trust sub-network …,Web Services (ICWS); 2016 IEEE International Conference on,2016,1
Learning abstract snippet detectors with temporal embedding in convolutional neural networks,Jiajun Liu; Kun Zhao; Brano Kusy; Ji-rong Wen; Kai Zheng; Raja Jurdak,The prediction of periodical time-series remains challenging due to various types of scaling;misalignments and distortion effects. Here; we propose a novel model called Temporalembedding-enhanced convolutional neural Network (TeNet) to learn repeatedly-occurring-yet-hidden structural elements in periodical time-series; called abstract snippet detectors; topredict future changes. Our model effectively learns a new feature space for a time-seriesdataset. In the new feature space; distorted time-series that have implicit similarity butsubstantial differences in value and sequence to regular patterns are re-aligned to theregular patterns in the dataset; and subsequently contribute to a robust prediction mode. Themodel is robust to various types of distortions and misalignments and demonstrates strongprediction power for periodical time-series.

Quality-Aware Entity-Level Semantic Representations for Short Texts.,Wen Hua; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Recent prevalence of Web search engines; microblogging services as well asinstant messaging tools give rise to a large amount of short texts including queries; tweetsand instant messages. A better understanding of the semantics embedded in short texts isindispensable for various Web applications. We adopt the entity-level semanticrepresentation which interpretes a short text as a sequence of mentionenity pairs. A typicalstrategy consists of two steps: entity extraction to locate entity mentions; and entity linking toidentify their corresponding entities. However; it is never a trivial task to achieve high quality(ie; complete and accurate) interpretations for short texts. First; short texts are noisy;containing massive abbreviations; nicknames and misspellings. As a result; traditional entityextraction methods cannot detect every potential entity mentions. Second; entities are …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2016,1

In this paper; by bridging consumer behavior with perceived stimuli on socialnetworks; we present a computational framework; termed Consumer Impulsivity Model(CIM); for exploring a consumer's impulsivity in both offline and online context: consumption-related location visit indicating consumption patterns in the physical realm; and onlineshopping behavior indicating economic activities on the Internet. To demonstrate theeffectiveness of CIM; we conduct extensive experiments; with a large dataset we havecollected from thousands of consumers.

They have been used as a means for a rich variety of activities; such as seekingservice providers or recommendations. In these activities; trust is one of the most importantfactors for participants' decision-making process. Therefore; it is necessary and significant topredict the trust between two participants who have no direct interactions. My thesis aims toprovide effective and efficient trust prediction approaches to evaluate trust values; which areintroduced from the following four aspects. The first aspect of the work is to study the factorsthat affect trust in OSNs and solve the trust network extraction problem. OSNs containimportant participants; the trust relations between participants; and the contexts in whichparticipants interact with each other.

Benchmarking big data for trip recommendation,Kuien Liu; Yaguang Li; Zhiming Ding; Shuo Shang; Kai Zheng,The availability of massive trajectory data collected from GPS devices has receivedsignificant attentions in recent years. A hot topic is trip recommendation; which focuses onsearching trajectories that connect (or are close to) a set of query locations; eg; severalsightseeing places specified by a traveller; from a collection of historic trajectories made byother travellers. However; if we know little about the sample coverage of trajectory datawhen developing an application of trip recommendation; it is difficult for us to answer manypractical questions; such as 1) how many (future) queries can be supported with a given setof raw trajectories? 2) how many trajectories are required to achieve a good-enough result?3) how frequent the update operations need to be performed on trajectory data to keep itlong-term effective?

Efficient Aggregate Farthest Neighbour Query Processing on Road Networks,Haozhou Wang; Kai Zheng; Han Su; Jiping Wang; Shazia Sadiq; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract This paper addresses the problem of searching the k aggregate farthest neighbours(A k FN query in short) on road networks. Given a query point set; A k FN is aimed at findingthe top-k points from a dataset with the largest aggregate network distance. The challenge ofthe A k FN query on the road network is how to reduce the number of network distanceevaluation which is an expensive operation. In our work; we propose a three-phase solution;including clustering points in dataset; network distance bound pre-computing and searching.By organizing the objects into compact clusters and pre-calculating the network distancebound from clusters to a set of reference points; we can effectively prune a large fraction ofclusters without probing each individual point inside.

Rights Protection for Trajectory Streams,Mingliang Yue; Zhiyong Peng; Kai Zheng; Yuwei Peng,Abstract More and more trajectory data are available as streams due to the unprecedentedprevalence of mobile positioning devices. Meanwhile; an increasing number of applicationsare designed to be dependent on real-time trajectory streams. Therefore; the protection ofownership rights over such data becomes a necessity. In this paper; we propose an onlinewatermarking scheme that can be used for the rights protection of trajectory streams. Thescheme works in a finite window; single-pass streaming model. It embeds watermark bymodifying feature distances extracted from the streams. The fact that these feature distancescan be recovered ensures a consistent overlap between the recovered watermark and theembedded one. Experimental results verify the robustness of the scheme against domain-specific attacks; including geometric transformations; noise addition; trajectory …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2014,1

MCS-GPM: Multi-Constrained Simulation Based Graph Pattern Matching in Contextual Social Graphs,Guanfeng Liu; Kai Zheng; An Liu; Zhixu Li; Yan Wang; Xiaofang Zhou,Graph Pattern Matching (GPM) has been used in lots of areas; like biology; medical science;and physics. With the advent of Online Social Networks (OSNs); recently; GPM has beenplaying a significant role in social network analysis; which has been widely used in; forexample; finding experts; social community mining and social position detection.

Exploiting Hierarchical Structures for POI Recommendation,Pengpeng Zhao; Xiefeng Xu; Yanchi Liu; Ziting Zhou; Kai Zheng; Victor S Sheng; Hui Xiong,With the rapid development of location-based social networks; Point-of-Interest (POI)recommendation has played an important role in helping people discover attractivelocations. However; existing POI recommendation methods assume a flat structure of POIs;which are better described in a hierarchical structure in reality. Furthermore; we discover thatboth users' content and spatial preferences exhibit hierarchical structures. To this end; in thispaper; we propose a hierarchical geographical matrix factorization model (HGMF) to utilizethe hierarchical structures of both users and POIs for POI recommendation. Specifically; wefirst describe the POI influence degrees over regions with two-dimensional normaldistribution; and learn the influence areas of different layers of POIs as the input of HGMF.Then; we perform matrix factorization on user content preference matrix; user spatial …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2017 IEEE International Conference on,2017,*
CNN-IETS: A CNN-based Probabilistic Approach for Information Extraction by Text Segmentation,Meng Hu; Zhixu Li; Yongxin Shen; An Liu; Guanfeng Liu; Kai Zheng; Lei Zhao,Abstract Information Extraction by Text Segmentation (IETS) aims at segmenting text inputsto extract implicit data values contained in them. The state-of-art IETS approaches mainlyrely on machine learning techniques; either supervised or unsupervised. However; while thesupervised approaches require a large labelled training data; the performance of theunsupervised ones could be unstable on different data sets. To overcome their weaknesses;this paper introduces CNN-IETS; a novel unsupervised probabilistic approach that takes theadvantages of pre-existing data and a Convolution Neural Network (CNN)-basedprobabilistic classification model. While using the CNN model can ease the burden ofselecting high-quality features in associating text segments with attributes of a given domain;the pre-existing data as a domain knowledge base can provide training data with a …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,*
Destination-aware Task Assignment in Spatial Crowdsourcing,Yan Zhao; Yang Li; Yu Wang; Han Su; Kai Zheng,Abstract With the proliferation of GPS-enabled smart devices and increased availability ofwireless network; spatial crowdsourcing (SC) has been recently proposed as a framework toautomatically request workers (ie; smart device carriers) to perform location-sensitive tasks(eg; taking scenic photos; reporting events). In this paper we study a destination-aware taskassignment problem that concerns the optimal strategy of assigning each task to properworker such that the total number of completed tasks can be maximized whilst all workerscan reach their destinations before deadlines after performing assigned tasks. Finding theglobal optimal assignment turns out to be an intractable problem since it does not implyoptimal assignment for individual worker. Observing that the task assignment dependencyonly exists amongst subsets of workers; we utilize tree-decomposition technique to …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017,*
Interactive Spatial Keyword Querying with Semantics,Jiabao Sun; Jiajie Xu; Kai Zheng; Chengfei Liu,Abstract Conventional spatial keyword queries confront the difficulty of returning desiredobjects that are synonyms but morphologically different to query keywords. To overcome thisflaw; this paper investigates the interactive spatial keyword querying with semantics. It aimsto enhance the conventional queries by not only making sense of the query keywords; butalso refining the understanding of query semantics through interactions. On top of theprobabilistic topic model; a novel interactive strategy is proposed to precisely infer the latentquery semantics by learning from user feedbacks. In each interaction; the returned objectsare carefully selected to ensure effective inference of user intended query semantics.

However; no existing work has considered the visual content informationin these photos for tour recommendation. We believe the visual features of photos providevaluable information on measuring user/Point-of-Interest (POI) similarities; which ischallenging due to data sparsity. To this end; in this paper; we propose a visual featureenhanced tour recommender system; named'Photo2Trip'; to utilize the visual contents andcollaborative filtering models for recommendation. Specifically; we first extract various visualfeatures from photos taken by tourists. Then; we propose a Visual-enhanced ProbabilisticMatrix Factorization model (VPMF); which integrates visual features into the collaborative …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Multimedia Conference,2017,*

Anonymity-Based Privacy-Preserving Task Assignment in Spatial Crowdsourcing,Yue Sun; An Liu; Zhixu Li; Guanfeng Liu; Lei Zhao; Kai Zheng,Abstract The ubiquity of mobile device and wireless networks flourishes the market of SpatialCrowdsourcing (SC); in which location constrained tasks are sent to workers and expectedto be performed in some designated locations. To obtain a global optimal task assignmentscheme; the SC-server usually needs to collect location information of all workers. Duringthis process; there is a significant security concern; that is; SC-server may not be trustworthy;so it brings about a threat to workers location privacy. In this paper; we focus on the privacy-preserving task assignment in SC. By introducing a semi-honest third party; we present anapproach for task assignment in which location privacy of workers can be protected in a k-anonymity manner.

Crowd-Guided Entity Matching with Consolidated Textual Data,Zhi-Xu Li; Qiang Yang; An Liu; Guan-Feng Liu; Jia Zhu; Jia-Jie Xu; Kai Zheng; Min Zhang,Abstract Entity matching (EM) identifies records referring to the same entity within or acrossdatabases. Existing methods using structured attribute values (such as digital; date or shortstring values) may fail when the structured information is not enough to reflect the matchingrelationships between records. Nowadays more and more databases may have someunstructured textual attribute containing extra consolidated textual information (CText) of therecord; but seldom work has been done on using the CText for EM. Conventional stringsimilarity metrics such as edit distance or bag-of-words are unsuitable for measuring thesimilarities between CText since there are hundreds or thousands of words with each pieceof CText; while existing topic models either cannot work well since there are no obviousgaps between topics in CText.

Discrete Content-aware Matrix Factorization,Defu Lian; Rui Liu; Yong Ge; Kai Zheng; Xing Xie; Longbing Cao,Abstract Precisely recommending relevant items from massive candidates to a large numberof users is an indispensable yet computationally expensive task in many online platforms(eg; Amazon. com and Netflix. com). A promising way is to project users and items into aHamming space and then recommend items via Hamming distance. However; previousstudies didn't address the cold-start challenges and couldn't make the best use of preferencedata like implicit feedback. To fill this gap; we propose a Discrete Content-aware MatrixFactorization (DCMF) model; 1) to derive compact yet informative binary codes at thepresence of user/item content information; 2) to support the classification task based on alocal upper bound of logit loss; 3) to introduce an interaction regularization for dealing withthe sparsity issue.

Moreover; the existing GPM method for matching the designated node v0 doesnot consider the multiple constraints of the attributes associated with each vertex and eachedge which commonly exist in real applications; like the constraints of social contexts for theexperts recommendation in contextual social. In this paper; we first propose the Multi-Constrained Top-K Graph Pattern Matching problem (MC-Top-K-GPM); which involves theNP-Complete Multiple Constrained GPM problem.

Semantic-aware top-k spatial keyword queries,Zhihu Qian; Jiajie Xu; Kai Zheng; Pengpeng Zhao; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract The fast development of GPS equipped devices has aroused widespread use ofspatial keyword querying in location based services nowadays. Existing spatial keywordquery methodologies mainly focus on the spatial and textual similarities; while leaving thesemantic understanding of keywords in spatial Web objects and queries to be ignored. Toaddress this issue; this paper studies the problem of semantic based spatial keywordquerying. It seeks to return the k objects most similar to the query; subject to not only theirspatial and textual properties; but also the coherence of their semantic meanings. Toachieve that; we propose novel indexing structures; which integrate spatial; textual andsemantic information in a hierarchical manner; so as to prune the search space effectively inquery processing. Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate and compare them …,World Wide Web,2017,*
CAT: Context-Aware Trust-Oriented Worker Selection in Social Crowd,Yang Zhao; Guanfeng Liu; Kai Zheng; An Liu; Zhixu Li; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Finding trustworthy worker is a longstanding issue in crowdsourcing systems. Ontraditional crowdsouring platforms; like Amazon Mechanical Turk\reffn: Amazon MechanicalTurk; the trustworthiness of a worker is usually based on the contextual information; likedifferent types of tasks and different reward amounts of tasks. However; with the combinationof OSNs and the crowdsourcing applications in social crowd; in addition to the abovementioned task based contexts; the social contexts like the social relationships and thesocial positions of participants can greatly assist requestors to select trustworthy workers. Inorder to select the trustworthy workers in social crowd; in this paper; we first present acontextual social network structure which contains complex social contexts. Then wepropose a trust evaluation model taking both contexts information and the requirements of …,Computing and Informatics,2017,*
PaRE: A System for Personalized Route Guidance,Yaguang Li; Han Su; Ugur Demiryurek; Bolong Zheng; Tieke He; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract The turn-by-turn directions provided in existing navigation applications areexclusively derived from underlying road network topology information; ie; the connectivity ofedges to each other. Therefore; the turn-by-turn directions are simplified as metric translationof physical world (eg distance/time to turn) to spoken language. Such translation-thatignores human cognition of the geographic space-is often verbose and redundant for thedrivers who have knowledge about the geographical areas. In this paper; we study aPersonalized RoutE Guidance System dubbed PaRE-with which the goal is to generatemore customized and intuitive directions based on user generated content. PaRE utilizes awealth of user generated historical trajectory data to extract namely" landmarks"(eg; point ofinterests or intersections) and frequently visited routes between them from the road …,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web,2017,*
GPS-Simulated Trajectory Detection,Han Su; Wei Chen; Rong Liu; Min Nie; Bolong Zheng; Zehao Huang; Defu Lian,Abstract Due to the prevalence of GPS-enabled devices and wireless communicationtechnology; spatial trajectories have become the basis of many location based applications;eg; Didi. However; trajectory data suffers low quality problems causing by sensor errors andartificial forgeries. Sensor errors are inevitable while forgeries are always constructed onbad purpose. For example; some Didi drivers use GPS simulators to generate forgerytrajectories and make fake transactions. In this work we aim to distinguish whether a giventrajectory is a GPS simulated trajectory. By formulating this task as the problem of trafficspeed extracting and irregular measuring; we propose a simulated trajectory detectionframework. In traffic speed extracting phase; we first divide time into time slots and thenextract the regular speed of each road during each time slot. In irregular measuring phase …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2017,*
Efficient spatial keyword query processing on geo-textual data,Bolong Zheng,Abstract The past decades have witnessed a transformation from a desktop-based web to apredominantly mobile web; where more often than not; users access the web from mobiledevices. As a result; a huge volume of geo-textual web objects that have both geographicallocation and textual description have been generated. In literature; there have been lots ofefforts in enabling efficient processing largescale geo-textual data under a variety ofproblem settings. In spite of the remarkable progress in this field; unsolved challengesremain. In this PhD thesis; I investigate a few interesting but challenging problems of thisarea. The contribution of this thesis can be summarized in three aspects. First; a set of newquery predicates has been defined with a target of more diversified data types (eg; activitytrajectories); underlying spaces (eg; road network) and query semantics; by which users …,*,2017,*
A Robust Approach to Finding Trustworthy Influencer in Trust-Oriented E-Commerce Environments,Feng Zhu; Guanfeng Liu; Yan Wang; Mehmet A Orgun; An Liu; Zhixu Li; Kai Zheng,Abstract With the recognition of the significance of OSNs (Online Social Networks) in therecommendation of services in e-commerce; there are more and more e-commerce platformbeing combined with OSNs; forming social e-commerce; where a participant couldrecommend a product to his/her friends based on the participant's corresponding purchasingexperience. For example; at Epinions; a buyer could share product reviews with his/herfriends. In such platforms; a buyer providing lots of high quality reviews is very likely toinfluence many potential buyers' purchase behaviours. Such a buyer is believed to havestrong social influence. However; dishonest participants in OSNs can deceive the existingsocial influence evaluation models; by mounting attacks; such as Constant (Dishonestadvisors constantly provide unfairly positive/negative ratings to sellers.) and Camouflage …,International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing,2016,*

On Efficient Passenger Assignment for Group Transportation,Jiajie Xu; Guanfeng Liu; Kai Zheng; Chengfei Liu; Haoming Guo; Zhiming Ding,Abstract With the increasing popularity of LBS services; spatial assignment has become animportant problem nowadays. Nevertheless most existing works use Euclidean distance asthe measurement of spatial proximity. In this paper; we investigate a variant of spatialassignment problem with road networks as the underlying space. Given a set of passengersand a set of vehicles; where each vehicle waits for the arrival of all passengers assigned toit; and then carries them to the same destination; our goal is to find an assignment frompassengers to vehicles such that all passengers can arrive at earliest together. Such apassenger assignment problem has various applications in real life. However; finding theoptimal assignment efficiently is challenging due to high computational cost in the fastestpath search and combinatorial nature of capacity constrained assignment.

Go Beyond Raw Trajectory Data: Quality and Semantics.,Kai Zheng; Han Su,Abstract Past decades have witnessed extensive studies from both academia and industriesover trajectory data; which are generated from a diverse range of applications. Existingliterature mainly focuses on raw trajectories with spatio-temporal features such as location;time; speed; direction and so on. Recently; the pervasive use of smart mobile devices likesmart phones; watches and bands have brought about more generation of trajectory bypersonal users (instead of companies or organizations) and from online space (instead ofphysical space); where individuals can decide when and where to log on and share theirlocations with others. The more discentralized and contextualized trajectory sources havebrought some unique challenges for database management with respect to the quality andsemantics of trajectories data.
