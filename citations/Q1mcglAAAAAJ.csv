Mining concept-drifting data streams using ensemble classifiers,Haixun Wang; Wei Fan; Philip S Yu; Jiawei Han,Abstract Recently; mining data streams with concept drifts for actionable insights hasbecome an important and challenging task for a wide range of applications including creditcard fraud protection; target marketing; network intrusion detection; etc. Conventionalknowledge discovery tools are facing two challenges; the overwhelming volume of thestreaming data; and the concept drifts. In this paper; we propose a general framework formining concept-drifting data streams using weighted ensemble classifiers. We train anensemble of classification models; such as C4. 5; RIPPER; naive Beyesian; etc.; fromsequential chunks of the data stream. The classifiers in the ensemble are judiciouslyweighted based on their expected classification accuracy on the test data under the time-evolving environment. Thus; the ensemble approach improves both the efficiency in …,Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2003,1380
Models for Incomplete and Probabilistic Information,Charu C Aggarwal,Abstract We discuss; compare and relate some old and some new models for incompleteand probabilistic databases. We characterize the expressive power of c-tables over infinitedomains and we introduce a new kind of result; algebraic completion; for studying lessexpressive models. By viewing probabilistic models as incompleteness models withadditional probability information; we define completeness and closure under querylanguages of general probabilistic database models and we introduce a new such model;probabilistic c-tables; that is shown to be complete and closed under the relational algebra.We also identify fundamental connections between query answering with incomplete andprobabilistic databases and data provenance. We show that the calculations for incompletedatabases; probabilistic databases; bag semantics; lineage; and why-provenance are …,*,2009,614
Clustering by pattern similarity in large data sets,Haixun Wang; Wei Wang; Jiong Yang; Philip S Yu,Abstract Clustering is the process of grouping a set of objects into classes of similar objects.Although definitions of similarity vary from one clustering model to another; in most of thesemodels the concept of similarity is based on distances; eg; Euclidean distance or cosinedistance. In other words; similar objects are required to have close values on at least a set ofdimensions. In this paper; we explore a more general type of similarity. Under the pClustermodel we proposed; two objects are similar if they exhibit a coherent pattern on a subset ofdimensions. For instance; in DNA microarray analysis; the expression levels of two genesmay rise and fall synchronously in response to a set of environmental stimuli. Although themagnitude of their expression levels may not be close; the patterns they exhibit can be verymuch alike. Discovery of such clusters of genes is essential in revealing significant …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,614
Text mining in social networks,Charu C Aggarwal; Haixun Wang,Abstract Social networks are rich in various kinds of contents such as text and multimedia.The ability to apply text mining algorithms effectively in the context of text data is critical for awide variety of applications. Social networks require text mining algorithms for a wide varietyof applications such as keyword search; classification; and clustering. While search andclassification are well known applications for a wide variety of scenarios; social networkshave a much richer structure both in terms of text and links. Much of the work in the areauses either purely the text content or purely the linkage structure. However; many recentalgorithms use a combination of linkage and content information for mining purposes. Inmany cases; it turns out that the use of a combination of linkage and content informationprovides much more effective results than a system which is based purely on either of the …,*,2011,593
BLINKS: ranked keyword searches on graphs,Hao He; Haixun Wang; Jun Yang; Philip S Yu,Abstract Query processing over graph-structured data is enjoying a growing number ofapplications. A top-k keyword search query on a graph finds the top k answers according tosome ranking criteria; where each answer is a substructure of the graph containing all querykeywords. Current techniques for supporting such queries on general graphs suffer fromseveral drawbacks; eg; poor worst-case performance; not taking full advantage of indexes;and high memory requirements. To address these problems; we propose BLINKS; a bi-levelindexing and query processing scheme for top-k keyword search on graphs. BLINKS followsa search strategy with provable performance bounds; while additionally exploiting a bi-levelindex for pruning and accelerating the search. To reduce the index space; BLINKS partitionsa data graph into blocks: The bi-level index stores summary information at the block level …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,543
Probase: A probabilistic taxonomy for text understanding,Wentao Wu; Hongsong Li; Haixun Wang; Kenny Q Zhu,Abstract Knowledge is indispensable to understanding. The ongoing information explosionhighlights the need to enable machines to better understand electronic text in humanlanguage. Much work has been devoted to creating universal ontologies or taxonomies forthis purpose. However; none of the existing ontologies has the needed depth and breadthfor universal understanding. In this paper; we present a universal; probabilistic taxonomythat is more comprehensive than any existing ones. It contains 2.7 million conceptsharnessed automatically from a corpus of 1.68 billion web pages. Unlike traditionaltaxonomies that treat knowledge as black and white; it uses probabilities to modelinconsistent; ambiguous and uncertain information it contains. We present details of how thetaxonomy is constructed; its probabilistic modeling; and its potential applications in text …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,419
ViST: a dynamic index method for querying XML data by tree structures,Haixun Wang; Sanghyun Park; Wei Fan; Philip S Yu,Abstract With the growing importance of XML in data exchange; much research has beendone in providing flexible query facilities to extract data from structured XML documents. Inthis paper; we propose ViST; a novel index structure for searching XML documents. Byrepresenting both XML documents and XML queries in structure-encoded sequences; weshow that querying XML data is equivalent to finding subsequence matches. Unlike indexmethods that disassemble a query into multiple sub-queries; and then join the results ofthese sub-queries to provide the final answers; ViST uses tree structures as the basic unit ofquery to avoid expensive join operations. Furthermore; ViST provides a unified index onboth content and structure of the XML documents; hence it has a performance advantageover methods indexing either just content or structure.

Trinity: A distributed graph engine on a memory cloud,Bin Shao; Haixun Wang; Yatao Li,Abstract Computations performed by graph algorithms are data driven; and require a highdegree of random data access. Despite the great progresses made in disk technology; it stillcannot provide the level of efficient random access required by graph computation. On theother hand; memory-based approaches usually do not scale due to the capacity limit ofsingle machines. In this paper; we introduce Trinity; a general purpose graph engine over adistributed memory cloud. Through optimized memory management and networkcommunication; Trinity supports fast graph exploration as well as efficient parallelcomputing. In particular; Trinity leverages graph access patterns in both online and offlinecomputation to optimize memory and communication for best performance. These enableTrinity to support efficient online query processing and offline analytics on large graphs …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,398
Landmarks: a new model for similarity-based pattern querying in time series databases,C-S Perng; Haixun Wang; Sylvia R Zhang; D Stott Parker,In this paper we present the landmark model; a model for time series that yields newtechniques for similarity-based time series pattern querying. The landmark model does notfollow traditional similarity models that rely on pointwise Euclidean distance. Instead; it leadsto landmark similarity; a general model of similarity that is consistent with human intuitionand episodic memory. By tracking different specific subsets of features of landmarks; we canefficiently compute different landmark similarity measures that are invariant undercorresponding subsets of six transformations; namely; shifting; uniform amplitude scaling;uniform time scaling; uniform bi-scaling; time warping and non-uniform amplitude scaling. Amethod of identifying features that are invariant under these transformations is proposed. Wealso discuss a generalized approach for removing noise from raw time series without …,Data Engineering; 2000. Proceedings. 16th International Conference on,2000,384
/spl delta/-clusters: capturing subspace correlation in a large data set,Jiong Yang; Wei Wang; Haixun Wang; Philip Yu,Clustering has been an active research area of great practical importance for recent years.Most previous clustering models have focused on grouping objects with similar values on a(sub) set of dimensions (eg; subspace cluster) and assumed that every object has anassociated value on every dimension (eg; bicluster). These existing cluster models may notalways be adequate in capturing coherence exhibited among objects. Strong coherencemay still exist among a set of objects (on a subset of attributes) even if they take quitedifferent values on each attribute and the attribute values are not fully specified. This is verycommon in many applications including bio-informatics analysis as well as collaborativefiltering analysis; where the data may be incomplete and subject to biases. In bio-informatics; a bicluster model has recently been proposed to capture coherence among a …,Data Engineering; 2002. Proceedings. 18th International Conference on,2002,383
Enhanced biclustering on expression data,Jiong Yang; Haixun Wang; Wei Wang; Philip Yu,Microarrays are one of the latest breakthroughs in experimental molecular biology; whichprovide a powerful tool by which the expression patterns of thousands of genes can bemonitored simultaneously and are already producing huge amount of valuable data. Theconcept of bicluster was introduced by Cheng and Church (2000) to capture the coherenceof a subset of genes and a subset of conditions. A set of heuristic algorithms were alsodesigned to either find one bicluster or a set of biclusters; which consist of iterations ofmasking null values and discovered biclusters; coarse and fine node deletion; nodeaddition; and the inclusion of inverted data. These heuristics inevitably suffer from someserious drawback. The masking of null values and discovered biclusters with randomnumbers may result in the phenomenon of random interference which in turn impacts the …,Bioinformatics and Bioengineering; 2003.

Moment: Maintaining closed frequent itemsets over a stream sliding window,Yun Chi; Haixun Wang; Philip S Yu; Richard R Muntz,This paper considers the problem of mining closed frequent itemsets over a sliding windowusing limited memory space. We design a synopsis data structure to monitor transactions inthe sliding window so that we can output the current closed frequent itemsets at any time.Due to time and memory constraints; the synopsis data structure cannot monitor all possibleitemsets. However; monitoring only frequent itemsets make it impossible to detect newitemsets when they become frequent. In this paper; we introduce a compact data structure;the closed enumeration tree (CET); to maintain a dynamically selected set of item-sets overa sliding-window. The selected itemsets consist of a boundary between closed frequentitemsets and the rest of the itemsets. Concept drifts in a data stream are reflected byboundary movements in the CET.

Integrity auditing of outsourced data,Min Xie; Haixun Wang; Jian Yin; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract An increasing number of enterprises outsource their IT services to third parties whocan offer these services for a much lower cost due to economy of scale. Quality of service isa major concern in outsourcing. In particular; query integrity; which means that query resultsreturned by the service provider are both correct and complete; must be assured. Previouswork requires clients to manage data locally to audit the results sent back by the server; ordatabase engine to be modified for generating authenticated results. In this paper; weintroduce a novel integrity audit mechanism that eliminating these costly requirements. Inour approach; we insert a small amount of records into an outsourced database so that theintegrity of the system can be effectively audited by analyzing the inserted records in thequery results.

Dual labeling: Answering graph reachability queries in constant time,Haixun Wang; Hao He; Jun Yang; Philip S Yu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Graph reachability is fundamental to a wide range of applications; including XML indexing;geographic navigation; Internet routing; ontology queries based on RDF/OWL; etc. Manyapplications involve huge graphs and require fast answering of reachability queries. Severalreachability labeling methods have been proposed for this purpose. They assign labels tothe vertices; such that the reachability between any two vertices may be decided using theirlabels only. For sparse graphs; 2-hop based reachability labeling schemes answerreachability queries efficiently using relatively small label space. However; the labelingprocess itself is often too time consuming to be practical for large graphs. In this paper; wepropose a novel labeling scheme for sparse graphs. Our scheme ensures that graphreachability queries can be answered in constant time. Furthermore; for sparse graphs …,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06.

Efficient subgraph matching on billion node graphs,Zhao Sun; Hongzhi Wang; Haixun Wang; Bin Shao; Jianzhong Li,Abstract The ability to handle large scale graph data is crucial to an increasing number ofapplications. Much work has been dedicated to supporting basic graph operations such assubgraph matching; reachability; regular expression matching; etc. In many cases; graphindices are employed to speed up query processing. Typically; most indices require eithersuper-linear indexing time or super-linear indexing space. Unfortunately; for very largegraphs; super-linear approaches are almost always infeasible. In this paper; we study theproblem of subgraph matching on billion-node graphs. We present a novel algorithm thatsupports efficient subgraph matching for graphs deployed on a distributed memory store.Instead of relying on super-linear indices; we use efficient graph exploration and massiveparallel computing for query processing.

Query languages and data models for database sequences and data streams,Yan-Nei Law; Haixun Wang; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract We study the fundamental limitations of relational algebra (RA) and SQL insupporting sequence and stream queries; and present effective query language and datamodel enrichments to deal with them. We begin by observing the well-known limitations ofSQL in application domains which are important for data streams; such as sequence queriesand data mining. Then we present a formal proof that; for continuous queries on datastreams; SQL suffers from additional expressive power problems. We begin by focusing onthe notion of nonblocking (NB) queries that are the only continuous queries that can besupported on data streams. We characterize the notion of nonblocking queries by showingthat they are equivalent to monotonic queries. Therefore the notion of NB-completeness forRA can be formalized as its ability to express all monotonic queries expressible in RA …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,224
A distributed graph engine for web scale RDF data,Kai Zeng; Jiacheng Yang; Haixun Wang; Bin Shao; Zhongyuan Wang,Abstract Much work has been devoted to supporting RDF data. But state-of-the-art systemsand methods still cannot handle web scale RDF data effectively. Furthermore; many usefuland general purpose graph-based operations (eg; random walk; reachability; communitydiscovery) on RDF data are not supported; as most existing systems store and index data inparticular ways (eg; as relational tables or as a bitmap matrix) to maximize one particularoperation on RDF data: SPARQL query processing. In this paper; we introduce Trinity. RDF;a distributed; memory-based graph engine for web scale RDF data. Instead of managing theRDF data in triple stores or as bitmap matrices; we store RDF data in its native graph form.

Efficiently answering reachability queries on very large directed graphs,Ruoming Jin; Yang Xiang; Ning Ruan; Haixun Wang,Abstract Efficiently processing queries against very large graphs is an important researchtopic largely driven by emerging real world applications; as diverse as XML databases; GIS;web mining; social network analysis; ontologies; and bioinformatics. In particular; graphreachability has attracted a lot of research attention as reachability queries are not onlycommon on graph databases; but they also serve as fundamental operations for many othergraph queries. The main idea behind answering reachability queries in graphs is to buildindices based on reachability labels. Essentially; each vertex in the graph is assigned withcertain labels such that the reachability between any two vertices can be determined by theirlabels. Several approaches have been proposed for building these reachability labels;among them are interval labeling (tree cover) and 2-hop labeling. However; due to the …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,161
Gstring: A novel approach for efficient search in graph databases,Haoliang Jiang; Haixun Wang; S Yu Philip; Shuigeng Zhou,Graphs are widely used for modeling complicated data; including chemical compounds;protein interactions; XML documents; and multimedia. Information retrieval against suchdata can be formulated as a graph search problem; and finding an efficient solution to theproblem is essential for many applications. A popular approach is to represent both graphsand queries on graphs by sequences; thus converting graph search to subsequencematching. State-of-the-art sequencing methods work at the finest granularity-each node (oredge) in the graph will appear as an element in the resulting sequence. Clearly; suchmethods are not semantic conscious; and the resulting sequences are not only bulky butalso prone to complexities arising from graph isomorphism and other problems in searching.In this paper; we introduce a novel sequencing method to capture the semantics of the …,Data Engineering; 2007.

Short text conceptualization using a probabilistic knowledgebase,Yangqiu Song; Haixun Wang; Zhongyuan Wang; Hongsong Li; Weizhu Chen,Abstract Most text mining tasks; including clustering and topic detection; are based onstatistical methods that treat text as bags of words. Semantics in the text is largely ignored inthe mining process; and mining results often have low interpretability. One particularchallenge faced by such approaches lies in short text understanding; as short texts lackenough content from which statistical conclusions can be drawn easily. In this paper; weimprove text understanding by using a probabilistic knowledgebase that is as rich as ourmental world in terms of the concepts (of worldly facts) it contains. We then develop aBayesian inference mechanism to conceptualize words and short text. We conductedcomprehensive experiments on conceptualizing textual terms; and clustering short pieces oftext such as Twitter messages.

We design a synopsis data structure tomonitor transactions in the sliding window so that we can output the current closed frequentitemsets at any time. Due to time and memory constraints; the synopsis data structure cannotmonitor all possible itemsets. However; monitoring only frequent itemsets will make itimpossible to detect new itemsets when they become frequent.

Fast graph pattern matching,Jiefeng Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Bolin Ding; S Yu Philip; Haixun Wang,Due to rapid growth of the Internet technology and new scientific/technological advances;the number of applications that model data as graphs increases; because graphs have highexpressive power to model complicated structures. The dominance of graphs in real-worldapplications asks for new graph data management so that users can access graph dataeffectively and efficiently. In this paper; we study a graph pattern matching problem over alarge data graph. The problem is to find all patterns in a large data graph that match a user-given graph pattern.

We considerthe filter step as an R-semijoin; and propose a new optimization approach by interleaving R-joins with R-semijoins.

While there are some recent studies on mining data streams; we would like to askthe following essential question: What are the distinct features of mining data streamscompared to mining other kinds of data? In this paper; we take the following position: onlinemining of the changes in data streams is one of the core issues.

Active mining of data streams,Wei Fan; Yi-an Huang; Haixun Wang; Philip S Yu,Abstract Most previously proposed mining methods on data streams make an unrealisticassumption that “labelled” data stream is readily available and can be mined at anytime.However; in most real-world problems; labelled data streams are rarely immediatelyavailable. Due to this reason; models are refreshed periodically; that is usually synchronizedwith data availability schedule. There are several undesirable consequences of this “passiveperiodic refresh”. In this paper; we propose a new concept of demand-driven active datamining. It estimates the error of the model on the new data stream without knowing the trueclass labels. When significantly higher error is suspected; it investigates the true class labelsof a selected number of examples in the most recent data stream to verify the suspectedhigher error.,*,2004,131
Maple: A fast algorithm for maximal pattern-based clustering,Jian Pei; Xiaoling Zhang; Moonjung Cho; Haixun Wang; Philip S Yu,Pattern-based clustering is important in many applications; such as DNA micro-array dataanalysis; automatic recommendation systems and target marketing systems. However;pattern-based clustering in large databases is challenging. On the one hand; there can be ahuge number of clusters and many of them can be redundant and thus make the pattern-based clustering ineffective. On the other hand; the previous proposed methods may not beefficient or scalable in mining large databases. We study the problem of maximal pattern-based clustering. Redundant clusters are avoided completely by mining only the maximalpattern-based clusters. MaPle; an efficient and scalable mining algorithm is developed.

On the sequencing of tree structures for XML indexing,Haixun Wang; Xiaofeng Meng,Sequence-based XML indexing aims at avoiding expensive join operations in queryprocessing. It transforms structured XML data into sequences so that a structured query canbe answered holistically through subsequence matching. In this paper; we address theproblem of query equivalence with respect to this transformation; and we introduce aperformance-oriented principle for sequencing tree structures. With query equivalence; XMLqueries can be performed through subsequence matching without join operations; post-processing; or other special handling for problems such as false alarms. We identify a classof sequencing methods for this purpose; and we present a novel subsequence matchingalgorithm that observe query equivalence. Still; query equivalence is just a prerequisite forsequence-based XML indexing. Our goal is to find the best sequencing strategy with …,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005.

Since thisproblem is# P-Complete; we focus on efficiently and accurately approximating DCR online.Our main results include two new estimators for the probabilistic reachability.

Is random model better? on its accuracy and efficiency,Wei Fan; Haixun Wang; Philip S Yu; Sheng Ma,Inductive learning searches an optimal hypothesis that minimizes a given loss function. It isusually assumed that the simplest hypothesis that fits the data is the best approximate to anoptimal hypothesis. Since finding the simplest hypothesis is NP-hard for mostrepresentations; we generally employ various heuristics to search its closest match.Computing these heuristics incurs significant cost; making learning inefficient andunscalable for large dataset. At the same time; it is still questionable if the simplesthypothesis is indeed the closest approximate to the optimal model. Recent success ofcombining multiple models; such as bagging; boosting and meta-learning; has greatlyimproved the accuracy of the simplest hypothesis; providing a strong argument against theoptimality of the simplest hypothesis.

Understanding tables on the web,Jingjing Wang; Haixun Wang; Zhongyuan Wang; Kenny Q Zhu,Abstract The Web contains a wealth of information; and a key challenge is to make thisinformation machine processable. In this paper; we study how to “understand” HTML tableson the Web; which is one step further from finding the schemas of tables. From 0.3 billionWeb documents; we obtain 1.95 billion tables; and 0.5-1% of these contain information ofvarious entities and their properties. We argue that in order for computers to understandthese tables; computers must first have a brain–a general purpose knowledge taxonomy thatis comprehensive enough to cover the concepts (of worldly facts) in a human mind. Second;we argue that the process of understanding a table is the process of finding the right positionfor the table in the knowledge taxonomy.

Fast computation of reachability labeling for large graphs,Jiefeng Cheng; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Xuemin Lin; Haixun Wang; S Yu Philip,Abstract The need of processing graph reachability queries stems from many applicationsthat manage complex data as graphs. The applications include transportation network;Internet traffic analyzing; Web navigation; semantic web; chemical informatics and bio-informatics systems; and computer vision. A graph reachability query; as one of the primarytasks; is to find whether two given data objects; u and v; are related in any ways in a largeand complex dataset. Formally; the query is about to find if v is reachable from u in a directedgraph which is large in size. In this paper; we focus ourselves on building a reachabilitylabeling for a large directed graph; in order to process reachability queries efficiently. Such alabeling needs to be minimized in size for the efficiency of answering the queries; and needsto be computed fast for the efficiency of constructing such a labeling.

Discovering frequent closed partial orders from strings,Jian Pei; Haixun Wang; Jian Liu; Ke Wang; Jianyong Wang; Philip S Yu,Mining knowledge about ordering from sequence data is an important problem with manyapplications; such as bioinformatics; Web mining; network management; and intrusiondetection. For example; if many customers follow a partial order in their purchases of aseries of products; the partial order can be used to predict other related customers' futurepurchases and develop marketing campaigns. Moreover; some biological sequences (eg;microarray data) can be clustered based on the partial orders shared by the sequences.Given a set of items; a total order of a subset of items can be represented as a string. A stringdatabase is a multiset of strings. In this paper; we identify a novel problem of mining frequentclosed partial orders from strings. Frequent closed partial orders capture the nonredundantand interesting ordering information from string databases.

Automatic taxonomy construction from keywords,Xueqing Liu; Yangqiu Song; Shixia Liu; Haixun Wang,Abstract Taxonomies; especially the ones in specific domains; are becoming indispensableto a growing number of applications. State-of-the-art approaches assume there exists a textcorpus to accurately characterize the domain of interest; and that a taxonomy can be derivedfrom the text corpus using information extraction techniques. In reality; neither assumption isvalid; especially for highly focused or fast-changing domains. In this paper; we study achallenging problem: Deriving a taxonomy from a set of keyword phrases. A solution canbenefit many real life applications because i) keywords give users the flexibility and ease tocharacterize a specific domain; and ii) in many applications; such as online advertisements;the domain of interest is already represented by a set of keywords. However; it is impossibleto create a taxonomy out of a keyword set itself.

A 2-hop cover can compactly represent thewhole edge transitive closure of a graph in O (| V|.| E| 1/2) space; and be used to answerreachability query efficiently. However; it is challenging to compute a 2-hop cover. Theexisting approaches suffer from either large resource consumption or low compression rate.In this paper; we propose a hierarchical partitioning approach to partition a large graph Ginto two subgraphs repeatedly in a top-down fashion. The unique feature of our approach isthat we compute 2-hop cover while partitioning. In brief; in every iteration of top-downpartitioning; we provide techniques to compute the 2-hop cover for connections between thetwo subgraphs first. A cover is computed to cut the graph into two subgraphs; which …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,93
Leveraging spatio-temporal redundancy for RFID data cleansing,Haiquan Chen; Wei-Shinn Ku; Haixun Wang; Min-Te Sun,Abstract Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies are used in many applicationsfor data collection. However; raw RFID readings are usually of low quality and may containmany anomalies. An ideal solution for RFID data cleansing should address the followingissues. First; in many applications; duplicate readings (by multiple readers simultaneously orby a single reader over a period of time) of the same object are very common. The solutionshould take advantage of the resulting data redundancy for data cleaning. Second; priorknowledge about the readers and the environment (eg; prior data distribution; false negativerates of readers) may help improve data quality and remove data anomalies; and a desiredsolution must be able to quantify the degree of uncertainty based on such knowledge. Third;the solution should take advantage of given constraints in target applications (eg; the …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,92
Natural language question answering over RDF: a graph data driven approach,Lei Zou; Ruizhe Huang; Haixun Wang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Wenqiang He; Dongyan Zhao,Abstract RDF question/answering (Q/A) allows users to ask questions in natural languagesover a knowledge base represented by RDF. To answer a national language question; theexisting work takes a two-stage approach: question understanding and query evaluation.Their focus is on question understanding to deal with the disambiguation of the naturallanguage phrases. The most common technique is the joint disambiguation; which has theexponential search space. In this paper; we propose a systematic framework to answernatural language questions over RDF repository (RDF Q/A) from a graph data-drivenperspective. We propose a semantic query graph to model the query intention in the naturallanguage question in a structural way; based on which; RDF Q/A is reduced to subgraphmatching problem. More importantly; we resolve the ambiguity of natural language …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,90

Location-based spatial query processing with data sharing in wireless broadcast environments,Wei-Shinn Ku; Roger Zimmermann; Haixun Wang,Location-based spatial queries (LBSQs) refer to spatial queries whose answers rely on thelocation of the inquirer. Efficient processing of LBSQs is of critical importance with the ever-increasing deployment and use of mobile technologies. We show that LBSQs have certainunique characteristics that traditional spatial query processing in centralized databasesdoes not address. For example; a significant challenge is presented by wirelessbroadcasting environments; which have excellent scalability but often exhibit high-latencydatabase access. In this paper; we present a novel query processing technique that; whilemaintaining high scalability and accuracy; manages to reduce the latency considerably inanswering location-based spatial queries. Our approach is based on peer-topeer sharing;which enables us to process queries without delay at a mobile host by using query results …,IEEE Transactions on mobile computing,2008,79
Computing compressed multidimensional skyline cubes efficiently,Jian Pei; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Xuemin Lin; Haixun Wang,Recently; the skyline computation and analysis have been extended from one single fullspace to multidimensional subspaces; which can lead to valuable insights in someapplications. Particularly; compressed skyline cubes in the form of skyline groups and theirdecisive subspaces provide a succinct summarization and compression of multidimensionalsubspace skylines. However; computing skyline cubes remains a challenging task since theexisting methods have to search an exponential number of nonempty subspaces forsubspace skylines. In this paper; we propose a novel and efficient method; Stellar; whichexploits an interesting skyline group lattice on a small subset of objects which are in theskyline of the full space.

Semantic multidimensional scaling for open-domain sentiment analysis,Erik Cambria; Yangqiu Song; Haixun Wang; Newton Howard,The ability to understand natural language text is far from being emulated in machines. Oneof the main hurdles to overcome is that computers lack both the common and common-sense knowledge that humans normally acquire during the formative years of their lives. Toreally understand natural language; a machine should be able to comprehend this type ofknowledge; rather than merely relying on the valence of keywords and word co-occurrencefrequencies. In this article; the largest existing taxonomy of common knowledge is blendedwith a natural-language-based semantic network of common-sense knowledge.Multidimensional scaling is applied on the resulting knowledge base for open-domainopinion mining and sentiment analysis.,IEEE Intelligent Systems,2014,77

Computing label-constraint reachability in graph databases,Ruoming Jin; Hui Hong; Haixun Wang; Ning Ruan; Yang Xiang,Abstract Our world today is generating huge amounts of graph data such as social networks;biological networks; and the semantic web. Many of these real-world graphs are edge-labeled graphs; ie; each edge has a label that denotes the relationship between the twovertices connected by the edge. A fundamental research problem on these labeled graphs ishow to handle the label-constraint reachability query: Can vertex u reach vertex v through apath whose edge labels are constrained by a set of labels? In this work; we introduce anovel tree-based index framework which utilizes the directed maximal weighted spanningtree algorithm and sampling techniques to maximally compress the generalized transitiveclosure for the labeled graphs.

Atlas: A native extension of sql for data mining,Haixun Wang; Carlox Zaniolo,Abstract A lack of power and extensibility in their query languages has seriously limited thegenerality of DBMSs and hampered their ability to support data mining applications. Thus;there is a pressing need for more general mechanisms for extending DBMSs to supportefficiently database-centric data mining appliacations. To satisfy this need; we propose anew extensibility mechanism for SQL-compliant DBMSs; and demonstrate its power insupporting decision support applications. The key extension is the ability of defining newtable functions and aggregate functions in SQL—rather than in external procedurallanguages as Object-Relational (OR) DBMSs currently do. This simple extension turns SQLinto a powerful language for decision-support applications; including ROLAPs; time-seriesqueries; stream-oriented processing; and data mining functions.

Online search of overlapping communities,Wanyun Cui; Yanghua Xiao; Haixun Wang; Yiqi Lu; Wei Wang,Abstract A great deal of research has been conducted on modeling and discoveringcommunities in complex networks. In most real life networks; an object often participates inmultiple overlapping communities. In view of this; recent research has focused on miningoverlapping communities in complex networks. The algorithms essentially materialize asnapshot of the overlapping communities in the network. This approach has threedrawbacks; however. First; the mining algorithm uses the same global criterion to decidewhether a subgraph qualifies as a community. In other words; the criterion is fixed andpredetermined. But in reality; communities for different vertices may have very differentcharacteristics. Second; it is costly; time consuming; and often unnecessary to findcommunities for an entire network. Third; the approach does not support dynamically …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2013,69
Suppressing model overfitting in mining concept-drifting data streams,Haixun Wang; Jian Yin; Jian Pei; Philip S Yu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Mining data streams of changing class distributions is important for real-timebusiness decision support. The stream classifier must evolve to reflect the current classdistribution. This poses a serious challenge. On the one hand; relying on historical data mayincrease the chances of learning obsolete models. On the other hand; learning only from thelatest data may lead to biased classifiers; as the latest data is often an unrepresentativesample of the current class distribution. The problem is particularly acute in classifying rareevents; when; for example; instances of the rare class do not even show up in the mostrecent training data. In this paper; we use a stochastic model to describe the concept shiftingpatterns and formulate this problem as an optimization one: from the historical and thecurrent training data that we have observed; find the most-likely current distribution; and …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,68

Efficient subgraph search over large uncertain graphs,Ye Yuan; Guoren Wang; Haixun Wang; Lei Chen,ABSTRACT Retrieving graphs containing a query graph from a large graph database is akey task in many graph-based applications; including chemical compounds discovery;protein complex prediction; and structural pattern recognition. However; graph data handledby these applications is often noisy; incomplete; and inaccurate because of the way the datais produced. In this paper; we study subgraph queries over uncertain graphs. Specifically;we consider the problem of answering threshold-based probabilistic queries over a largeuncertain graph database with the possible world semantics. We prove that problem is# P-complete; therefore; we adopt a filtering-and-verification strategy to speed up the search. Inthe filtering phase; we use a probabilistic inverted index; PIndex; based on subgraphfeatures obtained by an optimal feature selection process. During the verification phase …,Proc.

Loadstar: A load shedding scheme for classifying data streams,Yun Chi; Philip S Yu; Haixun Wang; Richard R Muntz,Abstract We consider the problem of resource allocation in mining multiple data streams.Due to the large volume and the high speed of streaming data; mining algorithms must copewith the effects of system overload. How to realize maximum mining benefits under resourceconstraints becomes a challenging task. In this paper; we propose a load shedding schemefor classifying multiple data streams. We focus on the following problems: i) how to classifydata that are dropped by the load shedding scheme? and ii) how to decide when to dropdata from a stream? We introduce a quality of decision (QoD) metric to measure the level ofuncertainty in classification when exact feature values of the data are not available becauseof load shedding.

Local search of communities in large graphs,Wanyun Cui; Yanghua Xiao; Haixun Wang; Wei Wang,Abstract Community search is important in social network analysis. For a given vertex in agraph; the goal is to find the best community the vertex belongs to. Intuitively; the bestcommunity for a given vertex should be in the vicinity of the vertex. However; existingsolutions use\emph {global search} to find the best community. These algorithms; althoughstraight-forward; are very costly; as all vertices in the graph may need to be visited. In thispaper; we propose a\emph {local search} strategy; which searches in the neighborhood of avertex to find the best community for the vertex. We show that; because the minimum degreemeasure used to evaluate the goodness of a community is not\emph {monotonic}; designingefficient local search solutions is a very challenging task. We present theories andalgorithms of local search to address this challenge.

It is challenging not justbecause the graph is large; but because we can no longer assume that the data can beorganized in arbitrary ways to maximize the performance of the partitioning algorithm.Instead; the algorithm must adopt the same data and programming model adopted by thesystem and other applications.

However; the potentially explosive growth ofdatabase outsourcing is hampered by security concerns; namely data privacy and queryintegrity of outsourced databases. While privacy issues of outsourced databases have beenextensively studied; query integrity for outsourced databases has just started to drawattention from the database community. Currently; there still does not exist a solution thatcan provide complete integrity.

Short text understanding through lexical-semantic analysis,Wen Hua; Zhongyuan Wang; Haixun Wang; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,Understanding short texts is crucial to many applications; but challenges abound. First; shorttexts do not always observe the syntax of a written language. As a result; traditional naturallanguage processing methods cannot be easily applied. Second; short texts usually do notcontain sufficient statistical signals to support many state-of-the-art approaches for textprocessing such as topic modeling. Third; short texts are usually more ambiguous. We arguethat knowledge is needed in order to better understand short texts. In this work; we uselexical-semantic knowledge provided by a well-known semantic network for short textunderstanding. Our knowledge-intensive approach disrupts traditional methods for taskssuch as text segmentation; part-of-speech tagging; and concept labeling; in the sense thatwe focus on semantics in all these tasks.

Efficient subgraph similarity search on large probabilistic graph databases,Ye Yuan; Guoren Wang; Lei Chen; Haixun Wang,Abstract Many studies have been conducted on seeking the efficient solution for subgraphsimilarity search over certain (deterministic) graphs due to its wide application in manyfields; including bioinformatics; social network analysis; and Resource DescriptionFramework (RDF) data management. All these works assume that the underlying data arecertain. However; in reality; graphs are often noisy and uncertain due to various factors; suchas errors in data extraction; inconsistencies in data integration; and privacy preservingpurposes. Therefore; in this paper; we study subgraph similarity search on large probabilisticgraph databases. Different from previous works assuming that edges in an uncertain graphare independent of each other; we study the uncertain graphs where edges' occurrences arecorrelated.

Much work has been devoted topattern discovery from time series data; but not much has attempted to use the time seriesdata to unveil a system's internal dynamics.

Typically; the client applications want to obtain qualityassurance (eg; data authenticity and query completeness) of the outsourced databaseservice at a low cost. Previous work on database outsourcing has focused on issues such ascommunication overhead; secure data access; and data privacy.

Theconcept of bicluster was introduced by Cheng and Church1 to capture the coherence of asubset of genes and a subset of conditions. A set of heuristic algorithms were also designedto either find one bicluster or a set of biclusters; which consist of iterations of masking nullvalues and discovered biclusters; coarse and fine node deletion; node addition; and theinclusion of inverted data. These heuristics inevitably suffer from some serious drawback.The masking of null values and discovered biclusters with random numbers may result in thephenomenon of random interference which in turn impacts the discovery of high quality …,International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools,2005,57
Path-tree: An efficient reachability indexing scheme for large directed graphs,Ruoming Jin; Ning Ruan; Yang Xiang; Haixun Wang,Abstract Reachability query is one of the fundamental queries in graph database. The mainidea behind answering reachability queries is to assign vertices with certain labels such thatthe reachability between any two vertices can be determined by the labeling information.Though several approaches have been proposed for building these reachability labels; itremains open issues on how to handle increasingly large number of vertices in real-worldgraphs; and how to find the best tradeoff among the labeling size; the query answering time;and the construction time. In this article; we introduce a novel graph structure; referred to aspath-tree; to help labeling very large graphs. The path-tree cover is a spanning subgraph ofG in a tree shape. We show path-tree can be generalized to chain-tree which theoreticallycan has smaller labeling cost.

Loadstar: load shedding in data stream mining,Yun Chi; Haixun Wang; Philip S Yu,Abstract In this demo; we show that intelligent load shedding is essential in achievingoptimum results in mining data streams under various resource constraints. The Loadstarsystem introduces load shedding techniques to classifying multiple data streams of largevolume and high speed. Loadstar uses a novel metric known as the quality of decision(QoD) to measure the level of uncertainty in classification. Resources are then allocated tosources where uncertainty is high. To make optimum classification decisions and accurateQoD measurement; Loadstar relies on feature prediction to model the data dropped by theload shedding mechanism. Furthermore; Loadstar is able to adapt to the changing datacharacteristics in data streams. The system thus offers a nice solution to data mining withresource constraints.,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,55

Currently; most approaches workby" chasing trends"; that is; they keep learning or updating models from the evolving data;and use these impromptu models for online prediction. In many cases; this proves to be bothcostly and ineffective¿ much time is wasted on re-learning recurring concepts; yet theclassifier may remain one step behind the current trend all the time.

Query integrity assurance of location-based services accessing outsourced spatial databases,Wei-Shinn Ku; Ling Hu; Cyrus Shahabi; Haixun Wang,Abstract Outsourcing data to third party data providers is becoming a common practice fordata owners to avoid the cost of managing and maintaining databases. Meanwhile; due tothe popularity of location-based-services (LBS); the need for spatial data (eg; gazetteers;vector data) is increasing exponentially. Consequently; we are witnessing a new trend ofoutsourcing spatial datasets by data collectors. Two main challenges with outsourcingdatasets is to keep the data private (from the data provider) and ensure the integrity of thequery result (for the clients). Unfortunately; most of the techniques proposed for privacy andintegrity do not extend to spatial data in a straightforward manner. Hence; recent studiesproposed various techniques to support either privacy or integrity (but not both) on spatialdatasets.

Most of the existing work focuseson iceberg queries at a single node. However; in many real-life applications; data sets aredistributed across a large number of nodes. Two naïve approaches might be considered. Inthe first; each node ships its entire data set to a central server; and the central server usessingle-node algorithms to find icebergs. But it may incur prohibitive communicationoverhead. In the second; each node submits local icebergs; and the central server combineslocal icebergs to find global icebergs. But it may fail because in many important applications;globally frequent items may not be frequent at any node.

Attribute extraction and scoring: A probabilistic approach,Taesung Lee; Zhongyuan Wang; Haixun Wang; Seung-won Hwang,Knowledge bases; which consist of concepts; entities; attributes and relations; areincreasingly important in a wide range of applications. We argue that knowledge aboutattributes (of concepts or entities) plays a critical role in inferencing. In this paper; wepropose methods to derive attributes for millions of concepts and we quantify the typicality ofthe attributes with regard to their corresponding concepts. We employ multiple data sourcessuch as web documents; search logs; and existing knowledge bases; and we derivetypicality scores for attributes by aggregating different distributions derived from differentsources using different methods. To the best of our knowledge; ours is the first approach tointegrate concept-and instance-based patterns into probabilistic typicality scores that scaleto broad concept space. We have conducted extensive experiments to show the …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,50
Compact reachability labeling for graph-structured data,Hao He; Haixun Wang; Jun Yang; Philip S Yu,Abstract Testing reachability between nodes in a graph is a well-known problem with manyimportant applications; including knowledge representation; program analysis; and morerecently; biological and ontology databases inferencing as well as XML query processing.Various approaches have been proposed to encode graph reachability information usingnode labeling schemes; but most existing schemes only work well for specific types ofgraphs. In this paper; we propose a novel approach; HLSS (Hierarchical Labeling of Sub-Structures); which identifies different types of substructures within a graph and encodesthem using techniques suitable to the characteristics of each of them. We implement HLSSwith an efficient two-phase algorithm; where the first phase identifies and encodes stronglyconnected components as well as tree substructures; and the second phase encodes the …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2005,50
An online cost sensitive decision-making method in crowdsourcing systems,Jinyang Gao; Xuan Liu; Beng Chin Ooi; Haixun Wang; Gang Chen,Abstract Crowdsourcing has created a variety of opportunities for many challengingproblems by leveraging human intelligence. For example; applications such as imagetagging; natural language processing; and semantic-based information retrieval can exploitcrowd-based human computation to supplement existing computational algorithms.Naturally; human workers in crowdsourcing solve problems based on their knowledge;experience; and perception. It is therefore not clear which problems can be better solved bycrowdsourcing than solving solely using traditional machine-based methods. Therefore; acost sensitive quantitative analysis method is needed. In this paper; we design andimplement a cost sensitive method for crowdsourcing. We online estimate the profit of thecrowdsourcing job so that those questions with no future profit from crowdsourcing can be …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,47
Supporting ranking and clustering as generalized order-by and group-by,Chengkai Li; Min Wang; Lipyeow Lim; Haixun Wang; Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang,Abstract The Boolean semantics of SQL queries cannot adequately capture the" fuzzy"preferences and" soft" criteria required in non-traditional data retrieval applications. One wayto solve this problem is to add a flavor of" information retrieval" into database queries byallowing fuzzy query conditions and flexibly supporting grouping and ranking of the queryresults within the DBMS engine. While ranking is already supported by all major commercialDBMSs natively; support of flexibly grouping is still very limited (ie; group-by). In this paper;we propose to generalize group-by to enable flexible grouping (clustering specifically) of thequery results. Different from clustering in data mining applications; our focus is on supportingefficient clustering of Boolean results generated at query time. Moreover; we propose tointegrate ranking and clustering with Boolean conditions; forming a new type of …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,47
Indexing weighted-sequences in large databases,Haixun Wang; C-S Perng; Wei Fan; Sanghyun Park; Philip S Yu,We present an index structure for managing weighted-sequences in large databases. Aweighted-sequence is defined as a two-dimensional structure where each element in thesequence is associated with a weight. A series of network events; for instance; is a weighted-sequence in that each event has a timestamp. Querying a large sequence database byevents' occurrence patterns is a first step towards understanding the temporal causalrelationships among the events. The index structure proposed enables us to efficientlyretrieve from the database all subsequences; possibly noncontiguous; that match a givenquery sequence both by events and by weights. The index method also takes intoconsideration the nonuniformfrequency distribution of events in the sequence data. Inaddition; our method finds a broad range of applications in indexing scientific data …,Data Engineering; 2003. Proceedings. 19th International Conference on,2003,45
An algorithmic approach to event summarization,Peng Wang; Haixun Wang; Majin Liu; Wei Wang,Abstract Recently; much study has been directed toward summarizing event data; in thehope that the summary will lead us to a better understanding of the system that generatesthe events. However; instead of offering a global picture of the system; the summaryobtained by most current approaches are piecewise; each describing an isolated snapshotof the system. We argue that the best summary; both in terms of its minimal descriptionlength and its interpretability; is the one obtained with the understanding of the internaldynamics of the system. Such understanding includes; for example; what are the internalstates of the system; and how the system alternates among these states. In this paper; weadopt an algorithmic approach for event data summarization. More specifically; we use ahidden Markov model to describe the event generation process. We show that …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,44
A sampling-based approach to information recovery,Junyi Xie; Jun Yang; Yuguo Chen; Haixun Wang; S Yu Philip,There has been a recent resurgence of interest in research on noisy and incomplete data.Many applications require information to be recovered from such data. Ideally; an approachfor information recovery should have the following features. First; it should be able toincorporate prior knowledge about the data; even if such knowledge is in the form ofcomplex distributions and constraints for which no close-form solutions exist. Second; itshould be able to capture complex correlations and quantify the degree of uncertainty in therecovered data; and further support queries over such data. The database community hasdeveloped a number of approaches for information recovery; but none is general enough tooffer all above features. To overcome the limitations; we take a significantly more generalapproach to information recovery based on sampling. We apply sequential importance …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008.

A native extension of SQL for mining data streams,Chang Luo; Hetal Thakkar; Haixun Wang; Carlo Zaniolo,ESL1 enables users to develop stream applications in an SQL-like high level language that providesthe ease-of-use of a declarative language; which is Turing complete in terms of expressive power[11]. In the database community; there is much interest in data stream mining applications[13; 16; 20] and in Data Stream Management Systems (DSMS) [21; 14; 19; 18]; but; while highlydesirable; a marriage between the two faces difficult research challenges. The difficulty of thetask is demonstrated by traditional databases where; due to query language limitations; miningtasks are typically car- ried out using a cache mining approach: ie; by first moving the data fromthe DBMSs into a (memory or file based) cache; and then writing procedural programs to minethe cache [17]. But a similar solution is not possible for DSMS; since programming lan- guagescannot handle well massive data streams unless we intro- duce primitives for managing …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,44
CMP: A fast decision tree classifier using multivariate predictions,Haixun Wang; Carlo Zaniolo,Most decision tree classifiers are designed to keep class histograms for single attributes;and to select a particular attribute for the next split using said histograms. We propose atechnique where; by keeping histograms on attribute pairs; we achieve: a significant speed-up over traditional classifiers based on single attribute splitting; and the ability of buildingclassifiers that use linear combinations of values from non-categorical attribute pairs as splitcriterion. Indeed; by keeping two-dimensional histograms; CMP can often predict the bestsuccessive split; in addition to computing the current one; therefore; CMP is normally able togrow more than one level of a decision tree for each data scan. CMP's performanceimprovements are also due to techniques whereby non-categorical attributes are discretizedwithout loss in classification accuracy; in fact; we introduce simple techniques; whereby …,Data Engineering; 2000.

A fast algorithm for subspace clustering by pattern similarity,Haixun Wang; Fang Chu; Wei Fan; Philip S Yu; Jian Pei,Unlike traditional clustering methods that focus on grouping objects with similar values on aset of dimensions; clustering by pattern similarity finds objects that exhibit a coherent patternof rise and fall in subspaces. Pattern-based clustering extends the concept of traditionalclustering and benefits a wide range of applications; including large scale scientific dataanalysis; target marketing; Web usage analysis; etc. However; state-of-the-art pattern-basedclustering methods (eg; the pCluster algorithm) can only handle data sets of thousands ofrecords; which makes them inappropriate for many real-life applications. Furthermore;besides the huge data volume; many data sets are also characterized by their sequentiality;for instance; customer purchase records and network event logs are usually modeled asdata sequences. Hence; it becomes important to enable pattern-based clustering …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2004. Proceedings. 16th International Conference on,2004,43
Computing term similarity by large probabilistic isa knowledge,Peipei Li; Haixun Wang; Kenny Q Zhu; Zhongyuan Wang; Xindong Wu,Abstract Computing semantic similarity between two terms is essential for a variety of textanalytics and understanding applications. However; existing approaches are more suitablefor semantic similarity between words rather than the more general multi-word expressions(MWEs); and they do not scale very well. Therefore; we propose a lightweight and effectiveapproach for semantic similarity using a large scale semantic network automaticallyacquired from billions of web documents. Given two terms; we map them into the conceptspace; and compare their similarity there. Furthermore; we introduce a clustering approachto orthogonalize the concept space in order to improve the accuracy of the similaritymeasure. Extensive studies demonstrate that our approach can accurately compute thesemantic similarity between terms with MWEs and ambiguity; and significantly …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Conference on information & knowledge management,2013,42
Logic-based user-defined aggregates for the next generation of database systems,Carlo Zaniolo; Haixun Wang,Summary In this paper; we provide logic-based foundations for the extended aggregateconstructs required by advanced database applications. In particular; we focus on datamining applications and show that they require user-defined aggregates extended with earlyreturns. Thus; we propose a simple formalization of extended user-defined aggregates usingthe nondeterministic construct of choice. We obtain programs that have a formal semanticsbased on the concept of total stable models; but are also amenable to efficientimplementation. Our formalization leads to a simple syntactic characterization of user-defined aggregates that are monotone with respect to set containment. Therefore; theseaggregates can be freely used in recursive programs; and the fixpoints for such programscan be computed efficiently using the standard techniques of deductive databases.

Beyond ten blue links: enabling user click modeling in federated web search,Danqi Chen; Weizhu Chen; Haixun Wang; Zheng Chen; Qiang Yang,Abstract Click models have been positioned as an effective approach to interpret user clickbehavior in search engines. Existing click models mostly focus on traditional Web searchthat considers only ten homogeneous Web HTML documents that appear on the first search-result page. However; in modern commercial search engines; more and more Web searchresults are federated from multiple sources and contain non-HTML results returned by otherheterogeneous vertical engines; such as video or image search engines.

We observed that user click behavior infederated search is highly different from that in traditional Web search; making it difficult tointerpret using existing click models. In response; we propose a novel federated click model(FCM) to interpret user click behavior in federated search.

User defined aggregates in object-relational systems,Haixun Wang; Carlo Zaniolo,User-defined aggregates are essential in many advanced database applications;particularly in expressing data mining functions; but they find little support in current systemsincluding object-relational databases. Three serious limitations of current systems are (i) theinability to introduce new aggregates (eg; by coding them in procedural language asoriginally proposed in SQL3);(ii) the inability to return partial results during the computation(eg to support online aggregation); and (iii) the inability to use aggregates in recursivequeries (eg to express bill of materials and optimized graph searches). In this paper; wepresents a unified solution to these problems which realizes the SQL3 original proposal foruser-defined aggregates (U-DAs); and adds significant improvements in terms of expressivepower and ease of use: in fact our SQL-AG system also supports online aggregation …,Data Engineering; 2000.

K-reach: who is in your small world,James Cheng; Zechao Shang; Hong Cheng; Haixun Wang; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract We study the problem of answering k-hop reachability queries in a directed graph;ie; whether there exists a directed path of length k; from a source query vertex to a targetquery vertex in the input graph. The problem of k-hop reachability is a general problem ofthe classic reachability (where k=∞). Existing indexes for processing classic reachabilityqueries; as well as for processing shortest path queries; are not applicable or not efficient forprocessing k-hop reachability queries. We propose an index for processing k-hopreachability queries; which is simple in design and efficient to construct. Our experimentalresults on a wide range of real datasets show that our index is more efficient than the state-of-the-art indexes even for processing classic reachability queries; for which these indexes areprimarily designed. We also show that our index is efficient in answering k-hop …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,38
Event summarization for system management,Wei Peng; Charles Perng; Tao Li; Haixun Wang,Abstract In system management applications; an overwhelming amount of data aregenerated and collected in the form of temporal events. While mining temporal event data todiscover interesting and frequent patterns has obtained rapidly increasing research efforts;users of the applications are overwhelmed by the mining results. The extracted patterns aregenerally of large volume and hard to interpret; they may be of no emphasis; intricate andmeaningless to non-experts; even to domain experts. While traditional research efforts focuson finding interesting patterns; in this paper; we take a novel approach called eventsummarization towards the understanding of the seemingly chaotic temporal data. Eventsummarization aims at providing a concise interpretation of the seemingly chaotic data; sothat domain experts may take actions upon the summarized models.

Tracking and connecting topics via incremental hierarchical dirichlet processes,Zekai J Gao; Yangqiu Song; Shixia Liu; Haixun Wang; Hao Wei; Yang Chen; Weiwei Cui,Much research has been devoted to topic detection from text; but one major challenge hasnot been addressed: revealing the rich relationships that exist among the detected topics.Finding such relationships is important since many applications are interested in how topicscome into being; how they develop; grow; disintegrate; and finally disappear. In this paper;we present a novel method that reveals the connections between topics discovered from thetext data. Specifically; our method focuses on how one topic splits into multiple topics; andhow multiple topics merge into one topic. We adopt the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP)model; and propose an incremental Gibbs sampling algorithm to incrementally derive andrefine the labels of clusters. We then characterize the splitting and merging patterns amongclusters based on how labels change.

Index structure for supporting structural XML queries,*,The present invention provides a ViST (or “virtual suffix tree”); which is a novel indexstructure for searching XML documents. By representing both XML documents and XMLqueries in structure-encoded sequences; it is shown that querying XML data is equivalent tofinding (non-contiguous) subsequence matches. A variety of XML queries; including thosewith branches; or wild-cards ('*'and '//'); can be expressed by structure-encoded sequences.Unlike index methods that disassemble a query into multiple sub-queries; and then join theresults of these sub-queries to provide the final answers; ViST uses tree structures as thebasic unit of query to avoid expensive join operations. Furthermore; ViST provides a unifiedindex on both content and structure of the XML documents; hence it has a performanceadvantage over methods indexing either just content or structure.

A low-granularity classifier for data streams with concept drifts and biased class distribution,Peng Wang; Haixun Wang; Xiaochen Wu; Wei Wang; Baile Shi,Many applications track streaming data for actionable alerts; which may include; forexample; network intrusions; transaction frauds; bio-surveilence abnormalities; and so forth.Some stream classification models are built for this purpose. Due to concept drifts;maintaining a model's up-to-dateness has become one of the most challenging tasks inmining data streams. State-of-the-art approaches; including both the incrementally updatedclassifiers and the ensemble classifiers; have proved that model update is a very costlyprocess. In this paper; we show that reducing model granularity reduces the update cost; asmodels of fine granularity enable us to efficiently pinpoint local components in the model thatare affected by the concept drift. It also enables us to derive new model components toreflect the current data distribution; thus avoiding expensive updates on a global scale …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2007,35
Method for building space-splitting decision tree,*,A method is provided for data classification that achieves improved interpretability andaccuracy while preserving the efficiency and scalability of univariate decision trees. To builda compact decision tree; the method searches for clusters in subspaces to enablemultivariate splitting based on weighted distances to such a cluster. To classify an instancemore accurately; the method performs a nearest neighbor (NN) search among the potentialnearest leaf nodes of the instance. The similarity measure used in the NN search is basedon Euclidean distances defined in different subspaces for different leaf nodes. Sinceinstances are scored by their similarity to a certain class; this approach provides an effectivemeans for target selection that is not supported well by conventional decision trees.,*,2005,35
Relational languages and data models for continuous queries on sequences and data streams,Yan-Nei Law; Haixun Wang; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract Most data stream management systems are based on extensions of the relationaldata model and query languages; but rigorous analyses of the problems and limitations ofthis approach; and how to overcome them; are still wanting. In this article; we elucidate theinteraction between stream-oriented extensions of the relational model and continuousquery language constructs; and show that the resulting expressive power problems are evenmore serious for data streams than for databases. In particular; we study the loss ofexpressive power caused by the loss of blocking query operators; and characterizenonblocking queries as monotonic functions on the database. Thus we introduce the notionof NB-completeness to assure that a query language is as suitable for continuous queries asit is for traditional database queries. We show that neither RA nor SQL are NB-complete …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2011,34
Integrity assurance of query result from database service provider,*,A method; system and computer program product for confirming the validity of data returnedfrom a data store. A data store contains a primary data set encrypted using a first encryptionand a secondary data set using a second encryption. The secondary data set is a subset ofthe primary data set. A client issues a substantive query against the data store to retrieve aprimary data result belonging to the primary data set. A query interface issues at least onevalidating query against the data store. Each validating query returns a secondary dataresult belonging to the secondary data set. The query interface receives the secondary dataresult and provides a data invalid notification if data satisfying the substantive queryincluded in an unencrypted form of the secondary data result is not contained in anunencrypted form of the primary data result.,*,2011,34
Adaptive load diffusion for multiway windowed stream joins,Xiaohui Gu; S Yu Philip; Haixun Wang,In this paper; we present an adaptive load diffusion operator to enable scalable processingof multiway windowed stream joins (MWSJs) using a cluster system. The load diffusion isachieved by a set of novel semantics-pre serving tuple routing algorithms. Different fromprevious work; the load diffusion operator can (1) preserve the MWSJ semantics whilespreading tuples to different hosts for parallel join processing;(2) achieve fine-grained loadbalancing among distributed hosts; and (3) perform semantics-preserving onlineadaptations to maintain optimal performance in dynamic stream environments. We haveimplemented a prototype of the distributed MWSJ framework on top of the System Sdistributed stream processing system.

Context-Dependent Conceptualization.,Dongwoo Kim; Haixun Wang; Alice H Oh,Abstract Conceptualization seeks to map a short text (ie; a word or a phrase) to a set ofconcepts as a mechanism of understanding text. Most of prior research in conceptualizationuses human-crafted knowledge bases that map instances to concepts. Such approaches toconceptualization have the limitation that the mappings are not context sensitive. Toovercome this limitation; we propose a framework in which we harness the power of aprobabilistic topic model which inherently captures the semantic relations between words.By combining latent Dirichlet allocation; a widely used topic model with Probase; a large-scale probabilistic knowledge base; we develop a corpus-based framework for context-dependent conceptualization. Through this simple but powerful framework; we improveconceptualization and enable a wide range of applications that rely on semantic …,IJCAI,2013,33
Web scale taxonomy cleansing,Taesung Lee; Zhongyuan Wang; Haixun Wang; Seung-won Hwang,ABSTRACT Large ontologies and taxonomies are automatically harvested from web-scaledata. These taxonomies tend to be huge; noisy; and contains little context. As a result;cleansing and enriching those largescale taxonomies becomes a great challenge. A naturalway to enrich a taxonomy is to map the taxonomy to existing datasets that contain richinformation. In this paper; we study the problem of matching two web scale taxonomies.Besides the scale of the problem; we address the challenge that the taxonomies may notcontain enough context (such as attribute values). As existing entity resolution techniquesare based directly or indirectly on attribute values as context; we must explore externalevidence for entity resolution. Specifically; we explore positive and negative evidence inexternal data sources such as the web and in other taxonomies. To integrate positive and …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,33
System and method for ranked keyword search on graphs,*,Arrangements and methods for providing for the efficient implementation of ranked keywordsearches on graph-structured data. Since it is difficult to directly build indexes for generalschemaless graphs; conventional techniques highly rely on graph traversal in running time.The previous lack of more knowledge about graphs also resulted in great difficulties inapplying pruning techniques. To address these problems; there is introduced herein a newscoring function while the block is used as an intermediate access level; the result is anopportunity to create sophisticated indexes for keyword search. Also proposed herein is acost-balanced expansion algorithm to conduct a backward search; which provides a goodtheoretical guarantee in terms of the search cost.,*,2010,30
Efficient keyword search on uncertain graph data,Ye Yuan; Guoren Wang; Lei Chen; Haixun Wang,As a popular search mechanism; keyword search has been applied to retrieve useful data indocuments; texts; graphs; and even relational databases. However; so far; there is no workon keyword search over uncertain graph data even though the uncertain graphs have beenwidely used in many real applications; such as modeling road networks; influential detectionin social networks; and data analysis on PPI networks. Therefore; in this paper; we study theproblem of top-k keyword search over uncertain graph data. Following the similar answerdefinition for keyword search over deterministic graphs; we consider a subtree in theuncertain graph as an answer to a keyword query if 1) it contains all the keywords; 2) it has ahigh score (defined by users or applications) based on keyword matching; and 3) it has lowuncertainty.

Incorporating post-click behaviors into a click model,Feimin Zhong; Dong Wang; Gang Wang; Weizhu Chen; Yuchen Zhang; Zheng Chen; Haixun Wang,Abstract Much work has attempted to model a user's click-through behavior by mining theclick logs. The task is not trivial due to the well-known position bias problem. Some break-throughs have been made: two newly proposed click models; DBN and CCM; addressedthis problem and improved document relevance estimation. However; to further improve theestimation; we need a model that can capture more sophisticated user behaviors. Inparticular; after clicking a search result; a user's behavior (such as the dwell time on theclicked document; and whether there are further clicks on the clicked document) can behighly indicative of the relevance of the document. Unfortunately; such measures have notbeen incorporated in previous click models.

Herein; there is addressed theproblem of query equivalence with respect to this transformation; and thereis introduced aperformance-oriented principle for sequencing tree structures. With query equivalence; XMLqueries can be performed through subsequence matching without join operations; post-processing; or other special handling for problems such as false alarms.

Also introduced is a performance-oriented principle to guide the sequencing of tree structures. For any given XML dataset …,*,2009,28
Toward a distance oracle for billion-node graphs,Zichao Qi; Yanghua Xiao; Bin Shao; Haixun Wang,Abstract The emergence of real life graphs with billions of nodes poses significantchallenges for managing and querying these graphs. One of the fundamental queriessubmitted to graphs is the shortest distance query. Online BFS (breadth-first search) andoffline pre-computing pairwise shortest distances are prohibitive in time or space complexityfor billion-node graphs. In this paper; we study the feasibility of building distance oracles forbillion-node graphs. A distance oracle provides approximate answers to shortest distancequeries by using a pre-computed data structure for the graph. Sketch-based distanceoracles are good candidates because they assign each vertex a sketch of bounded size;which means they have linear space complexity. However; state-of-the-art sketch-baseddistance oracles lack efficiency or accuracy when dealing with big graphs. In this paper …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,27

Identifying users' topical tasks in web search,Wen Hua; Yangqiu Song; Haixun Wang; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract A search task represents an atomic information need of a user in web search. Tasksconsist of queries and their reformulations; and identifying tasks is important for searchengines since they provide valuable information for determining user satisfaction withsearch results; predicting user search intent; and suggesting queries to the user. Traditionalapproaches to identifying tasks exploit either temporal or lexical features of queries.However; many query refinements are topical; which means that a query and its refinementsmay not be similar on the lexical level. Furthermore; multiple tasks in the same searchsession may interleave; which means we cannot simply order the searches by theirtimestamps and divide the session into multiple tasks. Thus; in order to identify taskscorrectly; we need to be able to compare two queries at the semantic level.

Discovery in multi-attribute data with user-defined constraints,Chang-Shing Perng; Haixun Wang; Sheng Ma; Joseph L Hellerstein,Abstract There has been a growing interest in mining frequent itemsets in relational datawith multiple attributes. A key step in this approach is to select a set of attributes that groupdata into transactions and a separate set of attributes that labels data into items.Unsupervised and unrestricted mining; however; is stymied by the combinatorial complexityand the quantity of patterns as the number of attributes grows. In this paper; we focus onleveraging the semantics of the underlying data for mining frequent itemsets. For instance;there are usually taxonomies in the data schema and functional dependencies among theattributes. Domain knowledge and user preferences often have the potential to significantlyreduce the exponentially growing mining space. These observations motivate the design ofa user-directed data mining framework that allows such domain knowledge to guide the …,ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter,2002,25
A query integrity assurance scheme for accessing outsourced spatial databases,Wei-Shinn Ku; Ling Hu; Cyrus Shahabi; Haixun Wang,Abstract With the trend of cloud computing; outsourcing databases to third party serviceproviders is becoming a common practice for data owners to decrease the cost of managingand maintaining databases in-house. In conjunction; due to the popularity of location-based-services (LBS); the need for spatial data (eg; gazetteers; vector data) is increasingdramatically. Consequently; there is a noticeably new tendency of outsourcing spatialdatasets by data collectors. Two main challenges with outsourcing datasets are to keep thedata private (from the data provider) and to ensure the integrity of the query result (for theclients). Unfortunately; most of the techniques proposed for privacy and integrity do notextend to spatial data in a straightforward manner. Hence; recent studies proposed varioustechniques to support either privacy or integrity (but not both) on spatial datasets. In this …,Geoinformatica,2013,24

The S 2-Tree: An index structure for subsequence matching of spatial objects,Haixun Wang; Chang-Shing Perng,Abstract We present the S 2-Tree; an indexing method for subsequence matching of spatialobjects. The S 2-Tree locates subsequences within a collection of spatial sequences; ie;sequences made up of spatial objects; such that the subsequences match a given querypattern within a specified tolerance. Our method is based on (i) the string-searchingtechniques that locate substrings within a string of symbols drawn from a discrete alphabet(eg; ASCII characters) and (ii) the spatial access methods that index (unsequenced) spatialobjects. Particularly; the S 2-Tree can be applied to solve problems such as subsequencematching of time-series data; where features of subsequences are often extracted andmapped into spatial objects. Moreover; it supports queries such as “what is the longestcommon pattern of the two time series?”; which previous subsequence matching …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2001,24
Method for supporting ontology-related semantic queries in DBMSs with XML support,*,A method for supporting semantic matching queries in a database management system(DBMS) by extracting and storing the transitive/subsumption relationships from a givenontology data in a DBMS with native XML support. These transitive relationships aretransformed into a set of XML documents that are natural mappings of the hierarchicalstructure of the transitive relationships. A table function construct expresses semanticmatching queries in a declarative manner. The semantic matching queried are automaticallyrewritten or translated into standard SQL/XML search operators such as XQuery; XPath andXMLExists; and executed by the SQL/XML DBMS on the given instance data and theextracted transitive relationships data.,*,2010,22
System and method for sequence-based subspace pattern clustering,*,Unlike traditional clustering methods that focus on grouping objects with similar values on aset of dimensions; clustering by pattern similarity finds objects that exhibit a coherent patternof rise and fall in subspaces. Pattern-based clustering extends the concept of traditionalclustering and benefits a wide range of applications; including e-Commerce targetmarketing; bioinformatics (large scale scientific data analysis); and automatic computing(web usage analysis); etc. However; state-of-the-art pattern-based clustering methods (eg;the pCluster algorithm) can only handle datasets of thousands of records; which makes theminappropriate for many real-life applications. Furthermore; besides the huge data volume;many data sets are also characterized by their sequentiality; for instance; customer purchaserecords and network event logs are usually modeled as data sequences.

Location-based spatial queries with data sharing in wireless broadcast environments,Wei-Shinn Ku; Roger Zimmermann; Haixun Wang,Location-based spatial queries (LBSQs) refer to spatial queries whose answers rely on thelocation of the inquirer. Efficient processing of LBSQs is of critical importance with the ever-increasing deployment and use of mobile technologies. We show that LBSQs have certainunique characteristics that traditional spatial query processing in centralized databasesdoes not address. For example; a significant challenge is presented by wirelessbroadcasting environments; which often exhibit high-latency database access. In this paper;we present a novel query processing technique that; while maintaining high scalability andaccuracy; manages to reduce the latency considerably in answering location-based spatialqueries. Our approach is based on peer-to-peer sharing; which enables us to processqueries without delay at a mobile host by using query results cached in its neighboring …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007.

Mining extremely skewed trading anomalies,Wei Fan; S Yu Philip; Haixun Wang,Abstract Trading surveillance systems screen and detect anomalous trades of equity; bonds;mortgage certificates among others. This is to satisfy federal trading regulations as well as toprevent crimes; such as insider trading and money laundry. Most existing tradingsurveillance systems are based on hand-coded expert-rules. Such systems are known toresult in long developing process and extremely high “false positive” rates. We participate inco-developing a data mining based automatic trading surveillance system for one of thebiggest banks in the US. The challenge of this task is to handle very skewed positive classes(< 0.01%) as well as very large volume of data (millions of records and hundreds offeatures).

Farm: A framework for exploring mining spaces with multiple attributes,Chang-Shing Perng; Haixun Wang; Sheng Ma; Joseph L Hellerstein,Mining for frequent itemsets typically involves a preprocessing step in which data withmultiple attributes are grouped into transactions; and items are defined based on attributevalues. We hake observed that such fixed attribute mining can severely constrain thepatterns that are discovered. Herein; we introduce mining spaces; a new framework formining multi-attribute data that includes the discovery of transaction and item definitions(with the exploitation of taxonomies and functional dependencies if they are available). Weprove that special downward closure properties (or anti-monotonic property) hold for miningspaces; a result that allows us to construct efficient algorithms for mining patterns without theconstraints of fixed attribute mining. We apply our algorithms to real world data collectedfrom a production computer network. The results show that by exploiting the special kinds …,Data Mining; 2001.

Query Understanding through Knowledge-Based Conceptualization.,Zhongyuan Wang; Kejun Zhao; Haixun Wang; Xiaofeng Meng; Ji-Rong Wen,Abstract The goal of query conceptualization is to map instances in a query to conceptsdefined in a certain ontology or knowledge base. Queries usually do not observe the syntaxof a written language; nor do they contain enough signals for statistical inference. However;the available context; ie; the verbs related to the instances; the adjectives and attributes ofthe instances; do provide valuable clues to understand instances. In this paper; we first minea variety of relations among terms from a large web corpus and map them to relatedconcepts using a probabilistic knowledge base. Then; for a given query; we conceptualizeterms in the query using a random walk based iterative algorithm. Finally; we examine ourmethod on real data and compare it to representative previous methods.

Efficiently monitoring top-k pairs over sliding windows,Zhitao Shen; Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Wenjie Zhang; Haixun Wang,Top-k pairs queries have received significant attention by the research community. k-closestpairs queries; k-furthest pairs queries and their variants are among the most well studiedspecial cases of the top-k pairs queries. In this paper; we present the first approach toanswer a broad class of top-k pairs queries over sliding windows. Our framework handlesmultiple top-k pairs queries and each query is allowed to use a different scoring function; adifferent value of k and a different size of the sliding window. Although the number ofpossible pairs in the sliding window is quadratic to the number of objects N in the slidingwindow; we efficiently answer the top-k pairs query by maintaining a small subset of pairscalled K-sky band which is expected to consist of O (K log (N/K)) pairs. For all the queriesthat use the same scoring function; we need to maintain only one K-sky band. We present …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,21
An integrated data-driven framework for computing system management,Tao Li; Wei Peng; Charles Perng; Sheng Ma; Haixun Wang,With advancement in science and technology; computing systems are becomingincreasingly more complex with a growing number of heterogeneous software and hardwarecomponents. They are thus becoming more difficult to monitor; manage; and maintain.Traditional approaches to system management have been largely based on domain expertsthrough a knowledge acquisition solution that translates domain knowledge into operatingrules and policies. This process has been well known as cumbersome; labor intensive; anderror prone.

System and method for mining time-changing data streams,*,A general framework for mining concept-drifting data streams using weighted ensembleclassifiers. An ensemble of classification models; such as C4. 5; RIPPER; naive Bayesian;etc.; is trained from sequential chunks of the data stream. The classifiers in the ensemble arejudiciously weighted based on their expected classification accuracy on the test data underthe time-evolving environment. Thus; the ensemble approach improves both the efficiency inlearning the model and the accuracy in performing classification. An empirical study showsthat the proposed methods have substantial advantage over single-classifier approaches inprediction accuracy; and the ensemble framework is effective for a variety of classificationmodels.,*,2009,21

System and method for indexing weighted-sequences in large databases,*,The present invention provides an index structure for managing weighted-sequences inlarge databases. A weighted-sequence is defined as a two-dimensional structure in whicheach element in the sequence is associated with a weight. A series of network events; forinstance; is a weighted-sequence because each event is associated with a timestamp.Querying a large sequence database by events' occurrence patterns is a first step towardsunderstanding the temporal causal relationships among the events. The index structureproposed herein enables the efficient retrieval from the database of all subsequences(contiguous and non-contiguous) that match a given query sequence both by events and byweights. The index structure also takes into consideration the nonuniform frequencydistribution of events in the sequence data.,*,2008,20

We conduct a number of controlled experiments to evaluate theperformance of these competing methods. Our results indicate that while the indirectmethods can perform better in a situation in which nearly perfect modeling is possible; underthe more realistic situations in which the system's modeling parameters have restrictedattention; the indirect methods' performance tend to degrade.

Nonmonotonic reasoning in ldl++,Haixun Wang; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract Deductive database systems have made major advances on efficient support fornonmonotonic reasoning. A first generation of deductive database systems supported thenotion of stratification for programs with negation and set aggregates. Stratification is simpleto understand and efficient to implement but it is too restrictive; therefore; a secondgeneration of systems seeks efficient support for more powerful semantics based on notionssuch as well-founded models and stable models. In this respect; a particularly powerful setof constructs is provided by the recently enhanced LDL++ system that supports (i) monotonieuser-defined aggregates;(ii) XY-stratified programs; and (iii) the nondeterministic choiceconstructs under stable model semantics.

Automatic extraction of top-k lists from the web,Zhixian Zhang; Kenny Q Zhu; Haixun Wang; Hongsong Li,This paper is concerned with information extraction from top-k web pages; which are webpages that describe top k instances of a topic which is of general interest. Examples include“the 10 tallest buildings in the world”;“the 50 hits of 2010 you don't want to miss”; etc.Compared to other structured information on the web (including web tables); information intop-k lists is larger and richer; of higher quality; and generally more interesting. Therefore top-k lists are highly valuable. For example; it can help enrich open-domain knowledge bases(to support applications such as search or fact answering). In this paper; we present anefficient method that extracts top-k lists from web pages with high performance.

Lock-free consistency control for web 2.0 applications,Jiangming Yang; Haixun Wang; Ning Gu; Yiming Liu; Chunsong Wang; Qiwei Zhang,Abstract Online collaboration and sharing is the central theme of many web-based servicesthat create the so-called Web 2.0 phenomena. Using the Internet as a computing platform;many Web 2.0 applications set up mirror sites to provide large-scale availability and toachieve load balance. However; in the age of Web 2.0; where every user is also a writer andpublisher; the deployment of mirror sites makes consistency maintenance a Web scaleproblem. Traditional concurrency control methods (eg two phase lock; serialization; etc.) arenot up to the task for several reasons. First; large network latency between mirror sites willmake two phase locking a throughput bottleneck. Second; locking will block a large portionof concurrent operations; which makes it impossible to provide large-scale availability. Onthe other hand; most Web 2.0 operations do not need strict serializability-it is not the …,Proceedings of the 17th international conference on World Wide Web,2008,18
A balanced ensemble approach to weighting classifiers for text classification,Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Haixun Wang; David W Cheung; Huan Liu,This paper studies the problem of constructing an effective heterogeneous ensembleclassifier for text classification. One major challenge of this problem is to formulate a goodcombination function; which combines the decisions of the individual classifiers in theensemble. We show that the classification performance is affected by three weightcomponents and they should be included in deriving an effective combination function. Theyare:(1) Global effectiveness; which measures the effectiveness of a member classifier inclassifying a set of unseen documents;(2) Local effectiveness; which measures theeffectiveness of a member classifier in classifying the particular domain of an unseendocument; and (3) Decision confidence; which describes how confident a classifier is whenmaking a decision when classifying a specific unseen document.

On reducing classifier granularity in mining concept-drifting data streams,Peng Wang; Haixun Wang; Xiaochen Wu; Wei Wang; Baile Shi,Many applications use classification models on streaming data to detect actionable alerts.Due to concept drifts in the underlying data; how to maintain a model's up-to-dateness hasbecome one of the most challenging tasks in mining data streams. State of the artapproaches; including both the incrementally updated classifiers and the ensembleclassifiers; have proved that model update is a very costly process. In this paper; weintroduce the concept of model granularity. We show that reducing model granularity willreduce model update cost. Indeed; models of fine granularity enable us to efficiently pinpointlocal components in the model that are affected by the concept drift. It also enables us toderive new components that can easily integrate with the model to reflect the current datadistribution; thus avoiding expensive updates on a global scale.

A unified approach for computing top-k pairs in multidimensional space,Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Haixun Wang; Jianmin Wang; Wenjie Zhang,Top-k pairs queries have many real applications. k closest pairs queries; k furthest pairsqueries and their bichromatic variants are some of the examples of the top-k pairs queriesthat rank the pairs on distance functions.

Index structure for supporting structural XML queries,*,The present invention provides a ViST (or “virtual suffix tree”); which is a novel indexstructure for searching XML documents. By representing both XML documents and XMLqueries in structure-encoded sequences; it is shown that querying XML data is equivalent tofinding (non-contiguous) subsequence matches. A variety of XML queries; including thosewith branches; or wild-cards ('*'and '//'); can be expressed by structure-encoded sequences.Unlike index methods that disassemble a query into multiple sub-queries; and then join theresults of these sub-queries to provide the final answers; ViST uses tree structures as thebasic unit of query to avoid expensive join operations. Furthermore; ViST provides a unifiedindex on both content and structure of the XML documents; hence it has a performanceadvantage over methods indexing either just content or structure.

Toward topic search on the web,Yue Wang; Hongsong Li; Haixun Wang; Kenny Q Zhu,ABSTRACT Traditional web search engines treat queries as sequences of keywords andreturn web pages that contain those keywords as results. Such a mechanism is effectivewhen the user knows exactly the right words that web pages use to describe the content theyare looking for. However; it is less than satisfactory or even downright hopeless if the userasks for a concept or topic that has broader and sometimes ambiguous meanings. This isbecause keyword-based search engines index web pages by keywords and not by conceptsor topics. In fact they do not understand the content of the web pages. In this paper; wepresent a framework that improves web search experiences through the use of aprobabilistic knowledge base. The framework classifies web queries into different patternsaccording to the concepts and entities in addition to keywords contained in these queries …,*,2010,17

Wikification via link co-occurrence,Zhiyuan Cai; Kaiqi Zhao; Kenny Q Zhu; Haixun Wang,Abstract Wikification; which stands for the process of linking terms in a plain text document toWikipedia articles which represent the correct meanings of the terms; can be thought of as ageneralized Word Sense Disambiguation problem. It disambiguates multi-word expressions(MWEs) in addition to single words. Existing Wikification techniques either models thecontext of a given term as well as the Wikipedia article as bags of words; or compute globalconstraints among Wikipedia concepts by the link graph or link distributions. The first methoddoesn't achieve good results because the MWEs can have very different meanings than itsconstituent words which themselves are ambiguous. The second method doesn't producehigh accuracy because the link structure or link distribution is often biased or incomplete bythemselves due to the fact that Wikipedia pages are often sparsely linked.

Clustering by pattern similarity,Haixun Wang; Jian Pei,Abstract The task of clustering is to identify classes of similar objects among a set of objects.The definition of similarity varies from one clustering model to another. However; in most ofthese models the concept of similarity is often based on such metrics as Manhattan distance;Euclidean distance or other Lp distances. In other words; similar objects must have closevalues in at least a set of dimensions. In this paper; we explore a more general type ofsimilarity. Under the pCluster model we proposed; two objects are similar if they exhibit acoherent pattern on a subset of dimensions. The new similarity concept models a widerange of applications. For instance; in DNA microarray analysis; the expression levels of twogenes may rise and fall synchronously in response to a set of environmental stimuli.Although the magnitude of their expression levels may not be close; the patterns they …,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2008,16
XSeq: an indexing infrastructure for tree pattern queries,Xiaofeng Meng; Yu Jiang; Yan Chen; Haixun Wang,Abstract Given a tree-pattern query; most XML indexing approaches decompose it intomultiple sub-queries; and then join their results to provide the answer to the original query.Join operations have been identified as the most time-consuming component in XML queryprocessing. XSeq is a powerful XML indexing infrastructure which makes tree patterns a firstclass citizen in XML query processing. Unlike most indexing methods that directlymanipulate tree structures; XSeq builds its indexing infrastructure on a much simpler datamodel: sequences. That is; we represent both XML data and XML queries by structure-encoded sequences. We have shown that this new data representation preserves queryequivalence; and more importantly; through subsequence matching; structured queries canbe answered directly without resorting to expensive join operations.

Implicit semantics;however; are insufficient in supporting text or natural language based interfaces; which areadopted by an increasing number of applications. Indeed; in applications ranging fromautomatic ontology construction to question answering; explicit representation of semanticsis starting to play a more prominent role. In this paper; we introduce the task of conceptuallabeling (CL); which aims at generating a minimum set of conceptual labels that bestsummarize a bag of words. We draw the labels from a data driven semantic network thatcontains millions of highly connected concepts. The semantic network provides meaning tothe concepts; and in turn; it provides meaning to the bag of words through the conceptual …,IJCAI,2015,14
Isanette: A common and common sense knowledge base for opinion mining,Erik Cambria; Yangqiu Song; Haixun Wang; Amir Hussain,The ability to understand natural language text is far from being emulated in machines. Oneof the main hurdles to overcome is that computers lack both the common and the commonsense knowledge humans normally acquire during the formative years of their lives. If wewant machines to really understand natural language; we need to provide them with thiskind of knowledge rather than relying on the valence of keywords and word co-occurrencefrequencies. In this work; we blend the largest existing taxonomy of common knowledge witha natural-language-based semantic network of common sense knowledge; and use multi-dimensionality reduction techniques on the resulting knowledge base for opinion miningand sentiment analysis.,Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW); 2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on,2011,14
Querying uncertain data with aggregate constraints,Mohan Yang; Haixun Wang; Haiquan Chen; Wei-Shinn Ku,Abstract Data uncertainty arises in many situations. A common approach to queryprocessing uncertain data is to sample many" possible worlds" from the uncertain data andto run queries against the possible worlds. However; sampling is not a trivial task; as arandomly sampled possible world may not satisfy known constraints imposed on the data. Inthis paper; we focus on an important category of constraints; the aggregate constraints. Anaggregate constraint is placed on a set of records instead of on a single record; and a real-life system usually has a large number of aggregate constraints. It is a challenging task tofind qualified possible worlds in this scenario; since tuple by tuple sampling is extremelyinefficient because it rarely leads to a qualified possible world. In this paper; we introducetwo approaches for querying uncertain data with aggregate constraints: constraint aware …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,14
Effect of an inoculant and enzymes on fermentation quality and nutritive value of erect milkvetch (Astragalus adsurgens Pall.) silages,Ch Xu; H Wang; F Yang; Zh Yu,ABSTRACT The objective of this experiment was to determine the ensiling characteristics;microbial changes and in vitro degradation of erect milkvetch (Astragalus adsurgens Pall.)treated with different additives. Erect milkvetch was treated with distilled water (control);inoculant (I; lactic acid bacteria); enzymes (E; fibrolytic enzymes) and inoculant+ enzymes(I+ E) prior to ensiling. Three bag silos were used and opened after 1; 3; 5; 15; 30 and 45days for chemical analysis and microbial measurement. For all the silages; there was a rapiddecline in pH during the first 5 days of ensiling. Compared with the control; all addedtreatments (I; E and I+ E) resulted in higher (P< 0.05) lactic acid concentration at all ensilingperiods. The crude protein content was higher; and neutral detergent fibre; acid detergentfibre and sulphuric acid lignin were lower for all treatments compared with the control (P< …,J. Anim.

Semantic queries in databases: problems and challenges,Lipyeow Lim; Haixun Wang; Min Wang,Abstract Supporting semantic queries in relational databases is essential to many advancedapplications. Recently; with the increasing use of ontology in various applications; the needfor querying relational data together with its related ontology has become more urgent. Inthis paper; we identify and discuss the problem of querying relational data with itsontologies. Two fundamental challenges make the problem interesting. First; it is extremelydifficult to express queries against graph structured ontology in the relational querylanguage SQL; and second; in many cases where data and its related ontology arecomplicated; queries are usually not precise; that is; users often have only a vague notion;rather than a clear understanding and definition; of what they query for. We outline a query-by-example approach that enables us to support semantic queries in relational databases …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,14
Optimizing timestamp management in data stream management systems,Yijian Bai; Hetal Thakkar; Haixun Wang; Carlo Zaniolo,It has long been recognized that multi-stream operators; such as union and join; often haveto wait idly in a temporarily blocked state; as a result of skews between the timestamps oftheir input streams. It has been shown that the injection of heartbeat information throughpunctuation tuples can alleviate this problem. In this paper; we propose and investigatemore effective solutions that use timestamps generated on-demand to reactivate idle-waitingoperators. We thus introduce a simple execution model that efficiently supports on-demandpunctuation. Experiments show that response time and memory usage are reducedsubstantially by this approach.,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007. IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,14
Demand-driven frequent itemset mining using pattern structures,Haixun Wang; Chang-Shing Perng; Sheng Ma; S Yu Philip,Abstract Frequent itemset mining aims at discovering patterns the supports of which arebeyond a given threshold. In many applications; including network event managementsystems; which motivated this work; patterns are composed of items each described by asubset of attributes of a relational table. As it involves an exponential mining space; theefficient implementation of user preferences and mining constraints becomes the first priorityfor a mining algorithm. User preferences and mining constraints are often expressed usingpatterns' attribute structures. Unlike traditional methods that mine all frequent patternsindiscriminately; we regard frequent itemset mining as a two-step process: the mining of thepattern structures and the mining of patterns within each pattern structure. In this paper; wepresent a novel architecture that uses pattern structures to organize the mining space. In …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2005,14

User-defined aggregates in database languages,Haixun Wang; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract User-defined aggregates (UDAs) can be the linchpin of sophisticated data miningfunctions and other advanced database applications; but they find little support in currentdatabase systems. In this paper; we describe the SQL-AG prototype that overcomes theselimitations by supporting UDAs as originally proposed in Postgres and SQL 3. Then weextend the power and flexibility of UDAs by adding (i) early returns;(to express onlineaggregation) and (ii) syntactically recognizable monotonic UDAs that can be used inrecursive queries to support applications; such as Bill of Materials (BoM) and greedyalgorithms for graph optimization; that cannot be expressed under stratified aggregation.This paper proposes a unified solution to both the theoretical and practical problems ofUDAs; and demonstrates the power of UDAs in dealing with advanced database …,International Symposium on Database Programming Languages,1999,14
System and method for indexing weighted-sequences in large databases,*,The present invention provides an index structure for managing weighted-sequences inlarge databases. A weighted-sequence is defined as a two-dimensional structure in whicheach element in the sequence is associated with a weight. A series of network events; forinstance; is a weighted-sequence because each event is associated with a timestamp.Querying a large sequence database by events' occurrence patterns is a first step towardsunderstanding the temporal causal relationships among the events. The index structureproposed herein enables the efficient retrieval from the database of all subsequences(contiguous and non-contiguous) that match a given query sequence both by events and byweights. The index structure also takes into consideration the nonuniform frequencydistribution of events in the sequence data.,*,2015,13
Entity disambiguation based on a probabilistic taxonomy,Masumi Shirakawa; Haixun Wang; Yangqiu Song; Zhongyuan Wang; Kotaro Nakayama; Takahiro Hara; Shojiro Nishio,Abstract This paper presents a method for entity disambiguation; one of the most substantialtasks for machines to understand text in natural languages. In a natural language; termshave ambiguity; eg “Barcelona” usually means a Spanish city but it can also refer to aprofessional football club. In our work; we utilize a probabilistic taxonomy that is as rich asour mental world in terms of the concepts of worldly facts it contains. We then employ a naiveBayes probabilistic model to disambiguate a term by identifying its related terms in the samedocument. Specifically; our method consists of two steps: clustering related terms andconceptualizing the cluster using the probabilistic taxonomy. We cluster related termsprobabilistically instead of using any threshold-based deterministic clustering approach.

System and method for continuous diagnosis of data streams,*,In connection with the mining of time-evolving data streams; a general framework that mineschanges and reconstructs models from a data stream with unlabeled instances or a limitednumber of labeled instances. In particular; there are defined herein statistical profilingmethods that extend a classification tree in order to guess the percentage of drifts in the datastream without any labelled data. Exact error can be estimated by actively sampling a smallnumber of true labels. If the estimated error is significantly higher than empiricalexpectations; there preferably re-sampled a small number of true labels to reconstruct thedecision tree from the leaf node level.,*,2008,13
A random method for quantifying changing distributions in data streams,Haixun Wang; Jian Pei,Abstract In applications such as fraud and intrusion detection; it is of great interest tomeasure the evolving trends in the data. We consider the problem of quantifying changesbetween two datasets with class labels. Traditionally; changes are often measured by firstestimating the probability distributions of the given data; and then computing the distance;for instance; the KL divergence; between the estimated distributions. However; thisapproach is computationally infeasible for large; high dimensional datasets. The problembecomes more challenging in the streaming data environment; as the high speed makes itdifficult for the learning process to keep up with the concept drifts in the data. To tackle thisproblem; we propose a method to quantify concept drifts using a universal model that incursminimal learning cost. In addition; our model also provides the ability of performing …,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2005,13
ATLaS: A Turing-complete extension of SQL for data mining applications and streams,Haixun Wang; Carlo Zaniolo; Richard C Luo,ATLaS is a powerful database language and system that enables users to develop completedata-intensive applications in SQL—by writing new table functions and aggregates in SQL;rather than in procedural languages as in current OR systems. As a result; ATLaS is Turing-complete [12]; and very suitable for advanced data-intensive applications; such as datamining and stream queries [10]. The first ATLaS system and application suite is available fordownloading from [1]. The suite includes several data mining functions coded in ATLaS'SQLthat run with only a modest (20–40%) performance overhead with respect to the sameapplications written in C/C++. We are now developing an extension of ATLaS for streams.Our proposed ACM SIGMOD 2003 demo will illustrate the key features and applications ofAT-LaS.

Open Domain Short Text Conceptualization: A Generative+ Descriptive Modeling Approach.,Yangqiu Song; Shusen Wang; Haixun Wang,Abstract Concepts embody the knowledge to facilitate our cognitive processes of learning.Mapping short texts to a large set of open domain concepts has gained many successfulapplications. In this paper; we unify the existing conceptualization methods from a Bayesianperspective; and discuss the three modeling approaches: descriptive; generative; anddiscriminative models. Motivated by the discussion of their advantages and shortcomings;we develop a generative+ descriptive modeling approach. Our model considers termrelatedness in the context; and will result in disambiguated conceptualization. We show theresults of short text clustering using a news title data set and a Twitter message data set; anddemonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach compared with the state-of-the-artconceptualization and topic modeling approaches.,IJCAI,2015,13
Data-driven metaphor recognition and explanation,Hongsong Li; Kenny Q Zhu; Haixun Wang,Abstract Recognizing metaphors and identifying the source-target mappings is an importanttask as metaphorical text poses a big challenge for machine reading. To address thisproblem; we automatically acquire a metaphor knowledge base and an isA knowledge basefrom billions of web pages. Using the knowledge bases; we develop an inferencemechanism to recognize and explain the metaphors in the text. To our knowledge; this is thefirst purely data-driven approach of probabilistic metaphor acquisition; recognition; andexplanation. Our results shows that it significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methodsin recognizing and explaining metaphors.,Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2013,12

Cleansing uncertain databases leveraging aggregate constraints,Haiquan Chen; Wei-Shinn Ku; Haixun Wang,Emerging uncertain database applications often involve the cleansing (conditioning) ofuncertain databases using additional information as new evidence for reducing theuncertainty. However; past researches on conditioning probabilistic databases;unfortunately; only focus on functional dependency. In real world applications; mostadditional information on uncertain data sets can be acquired in the form of aggregateconstraints (eg; the aggregate results are published online for various statistical purposes).Therefore; if these aggregate constraints can be taken into account; uncertainty in data setscan be largely reduced. However; finding a practical method to exploit aggregate constraintsto decrease uncertainty is a very challenging problem.

Most previous methods are based on lexical patterns or the DistributionalInclusion Hypothesis; and the accuracy of such methods is not ideal. In this paper; wepropose a simple yet effective supervision framework to identify hypernymy relations usingdistributed term representations (aka term embeddings). First; we design a distance-marginneural network to learn term embeddings based on some pre-extracted hypernymy data.Then; we apply such embeddings as term features to identify positive hypernymy pairsthrough a supervision method.

Head; modifier; and constraint detection in short texts,Zhongyuan Wang; Haixun Wang; Zhirui Hu,Head and modifier detection is an important problem for applications that handle short textssuch as search queries; ads keywords; titles; captions; etc. In many cases; short texts suchas search queries do not follow grammar rules; and existing approaches for head andmodifier detection are coarse-grained; domain specific; and/or require labeling of largeamounts of training data. In this paper; we introduce a semantic approach for head andmodifier detection. We first obtain a large number of instance level head-modifier pairs fromsearch log. Then; we develop a conceptualization mechanism to generalize the instancelevel pairs to concept level. Finally; we derive weighted concept patterns that are concise;accurate; and have strong generalization power in head and modifier detection.Furthermore; we identify a subset of modifiers that we call constraints.

Semantic queries by example,Lipyeow Lim; Haixun Wang; Min Wang,Abstract With the ever increasing quantities of electronic data; there is a growing need tomake sense out of the data. Many advanced database applications are beginning to supportthis need by integrating domain knowledge encoded as ontologies into queries overrelational data. However; it is extremely difficult to express queries against graph structuredontology in the relational SQL query language or its extensions. Moreover; semantic queriesare usually not precise; especially when data and its related ontology are complicated.Users often only have a vague notion of their information needs and are not able to specifyqueries precisely. In this paper; we address these challenges by introducing a novel methodto support semantic queries in relational databases with ease.

Learning to rank with a novel kernel perceptron method,Xue-wen Chen; Haixun Wang; Xiaotong Lin,Abstract While conventional ranking algorithms; such as the PageRank; rely on the webstructure to decide the relevancy of a web page; learning to rank seeks a function capable ofordering a set of instances using a supervised learning approach. Learning to rank hasgained increasing popularity in information retrieval and machine learning communities. Inthis paper; we propose a novel nonlinear perceptron method for rank learning. Theproposed method is an online algorithm and simple to implement. It introduces a kernelfunction to map the original feature space into a nonlinear space and employs a perceptronmethod to minimize the ranking error by avoiding converging to a solution near the decisionboundary and alleviating the effect of outliers in the training dataset.

Load shedding in classifying multi-source streaming data: A Bayes Risk approach,Yijian Bai; Haixun Wang; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract Monitoring multiple streaming sources for collective decision making presentsseveral challenges. First; streaming data are often of large volume; fast speed; and highlybursty nature. Second; it is impossible to offload classification decisions to individual datasources; each of which lacks full knowledge for the decision making. Hence; the centralclassifier responsible for decision making may be frequently overloaded. In this paper; westudy intelligent load shedding for classifying multi-source data. We aim at maximizingclassification quality under resource (CPU and bandwidth) constraints. We use a Markovmodel to predict the distribution of feature values over time.

Understanding short texts through semantic enrichment and hashing,Zheng Yu; Haixun Wang; Xuemin Lin; Min Wang,Clustering short texts (such as news titles) by their meaning is a challenging task. Thesemantic hashing approach encodes the meaning of a text into a compact binary code.Thus; to tell if two texts have similar meanings; we only need to check if they have similarcodes. The encoding is created by a deep neural network; which is trained on textsrepresented by word-count vectors (bag-of-word representation). Unfortunately; for shorttexts such as search queries; tweets; or news titles; such representations are insufficient tocapture the underlying semantics. To cluster short texts by their meanings; we propose toadd more semantic signals to short texts. Specifically; for each term in a short text; we obtainits concepts and co-occurring terms from a probabilistic knowledge base to enrich the shorttext.

A large probabilistic semantic network based approach to compute term similarity,Peipei Li; Haixun Wang; Kenny Q Zhu; Zhongyuan Wang; Xuegang Hu; Xindong Wu,Measuring semantic similarity between two terms is essential for a variety of text analyticsand understanding applications. Currently; there are two main approaches for this task;namely the knowledge based and the corpus based approaches. However; existingapproaches are more suitable for semantic similarity between words rather than the moregeneral multi-word expressions (MWEs); and they do not scale very well. Contrary to theseexisting techniques; we propose an efficient and effective approach for semantic similarityusing a large scale semantic network. This semantic network is automatically acquired frombillions of web documents. It consists of millions of concepts; which explicitly model thecontext of semantic relationships.

Efficient computation of range aggregates against uncertain location-based queries,Ying Zhang; Xuemin Lin; Yufei Tao; Wenjie Zhang; Haixun Wang,In many applications; including location-based services; queries may not be precise. In thispaper; we study the problem of efficiently computing range aggregates in a multidimensionalspace when the query location is uncertain.

System and method for exploring mining spaces with multiple attributes,*,Data with multiple attributes are separated into groups by performing at least the followingsteps for each group to be defined:(1) selecting a first subset of the attributes to be firstattributes; and (2) selecting a second subset of the attributes to be second attributes.Patterns that occur a predetermined number of times in the data are determined by using thegroups. A third part of a definition for a group includes the number of records having thegroup and item attributes. Groups are sorted into levels and each group has a number ofpredecessor relationships and a number of successor relationships with other groups. Thegroups then provide a mining space describing the data; and the groups are termed “miningcamps.” The mining camps are searched for patterns that occur a predetermined number oftimes. The searching determines predecessor relationships and uses the predecessor …,*,2004,10

Preference-based frequent pattern mining,Moonjung Cho; Jian Pei; Haixun Wang; Wei Wang,Abstract Frequent pattern mining is an important data-mining problem with broadapplications. Although there are many in-depth studies on efficient frequent pattern miningalgorithms and constraint pushing techniques; the effectiveness of frequent pattern miningremains a serious concern: It is non-trivial and often tricky to specify appropriate supportthresholds and proper constraints. In this paper; we propose a novel theme of preference-based frequent pattern mining. A user simply can specify a preference instead of settingdetailed parameters in constraints. We identify the problem of preference-based frequentpattern mining and formulate the preferences for mining. We develop an efficient frameworkto mine frequent patterns with preferences. Interestingly; many preferences can be pusheddeep into the mining by properly employing the existing efficient frequent pattern mining …,International Journal of Data Warehousing and Mining (IJDWM),2005,9
Graph similarity search on large uncertain graph databases,Ye Yuan; Guoren Wang; Lei Chen; Haixun Wang,Abstract Many studies have been conducted on seeking an efficient solution for graphsimilarity search over certain (deterministic) graphs due to its wide application in manyfields; including bioinformatics; social network analysis; and Resource DescriptionFramework data management. All prior work assumes that the underlying data isdeterministic. However; in reality; graphs are often noisy and uncertain due to variousfactors; such as errors in data extraction; inconsistencies in data integration; and for privacy-preserving purposes. Therefore; in this paper; we study similarity graph containment searchon large uncertain graph databases. Similarity graph containment search consists ofsubgraph similarity search and supergraph similarity search.

Optimizing index for taxonomy keyword search,Bolin Ding; Haixun Wang; Ruoming Jin; Jiawei Han; Zhongyuan Wang,Abstract Query substitution is an important problem in information retrieval. Much workfocuses on how to find substitutes for any given query. In this paper; we study how toefficiently process a keyword query whose substitutes are defined by a given taxonomy. Thisproblem is challenging because each term in a query can have a large number ofsubstitutes; and the original query can be rewritten into any of their combinations. Wepropose to build an additional index (besides inverted index) to efficiently process queries.For a query workload; we formulate an optimization problem which chooses the additionalindex structure; aiming at minimizing the query evaluation cost; under given index spaceconstraints.

On dimensionality reduction of massive graphs for indexing and retrieval,Charu C Aggarwal; Haixun Wang,In this paper; we will examine the problem of dimensionality reduction of massive disk-resident data sets. Graph mining has become important in recent years because of itsnumerous applications in community detection; social networking; and web mining. Manygraph data sets are defined on massive node domains in which the number of nodes in theunderlying domain is very large. As a result; it is often difficult to store and hold theinformation necessary in order to retrieve and index the data. Most known methods fordimensionality reduction are effective only for data sets defined on modest domains.Furthermore; while the problem of dimensionality reduction is most relevant to the problemof massive data sets; these algorithms are inherently not designed for the case of disk-resident data in terms of the order in which the data is accessed on disk.

Understand short texts by harvesting and analyzing semantic knowledge,Wen Hua; Zhongyuan Wang; Haixun Wang; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,Understanding short texts is crucial to many applications; but challenges abound. First; shorttexts do not always observe the syntax of a written language. As a result; traditional naturallanguage processing tools; ranging from part-of-speech tagging to dependency parsing;cannot be easily applied. Second; short texts usually do not contain sufficient statisticalsignals to support many state-of-the-art approaches for text mining such as topic modeling.Third; short texts are more ambiguous and noisy; and are generated in an enormousvolume; which further increases the difficulty to handle them. We argue that semanticknowledge is required in order to better understand short texts. In this work; we build aprototype system for short text understanding which exploits semantic knowledge providedby a well-known knowledgebase and automatically harvested from a web corpus.

The problem of k k-hop reachability is a general problem ofthe classic reachability (where k= ∞ k=∞). Existing indexes for processing classicreachability queries; as well as for processing shortest path distance queries; are notapplicable or not efficient for processing k k-hop reachability queries.

Asymmetric signature schemes for efficient exact edit similarity query processing,Jianbin Qin; Wei Wang; Chuan Xiao; Yifei Lu; Xuemin Lin; Haixun Wang,Abstract Given a query string Q; an edit similarity search finds all strings in a databasewhose edit distance with Q is no more than a given threshold τ. Most existing methodsanswering edit similarity queries employ schemes to generate string subsequences assignatures and generate candidates by set overlap queries on query and data signatures. Inthis article; we show that for any such signature scheme; the lower bound of the minimumnumber of signatures is τ &plus; 1; which is lower than what is achieved by existing methods.We then propose several asymmetric signature schemes; that is; extracting differentnumbers of signatures for the data and query strings; which achieve this lower bound.

RASIM: a rank-aware separate index method for answering top-k spatial keyword queries,Hyuk-Yoon Kwon; Kyu-Young Whang; Il-Yeol Song; Haixun Wang,Abstract A top-k spatial keyword query returns k objects having the highest (or lowest)scores with regard to spatial proximity as well as text relevancy. Approaches for answeringtop-k spatial keyword queries can be classified into two categories: the separate indexapproach and the hybrid index approach. The separate index approach maintains thespatial index and the text index independently and can accommodate new data types.However; it is difficult to support top-k pruning and merging efficiently at the same time sinceit requires two different orders for clustering the objects: the first based on scores for top-kpruning and the second based on object IDs for efficient merging. In this paper; we proposea new separate index method called Rank-Aware Separate Index Method (RASIM) for top-kspatial keyword queries.

Concept clustering of evolving data,Shixi Chen; Haixun Wang; Shuigeng Zhou,In Web search; a user refines his search several times before he finds the information heneeds. It is very likely that; in the search log; similar sequences of searches appear manytimes; as many users had searched the Web with the same intent. Precisely interpreting theintent of the user is difficult; even with the help of the search log: there might be numerousinstances of such intent scattering in small pieces in the log; but none of them iscomprehensive enough to describe the concept precisely. This scenario occurs in manyapplications. For example; patterns in Web search; Internet traffic; program execution traces;network events; etc.; are often non-stationary; yet the same patterns recur over time.

Pattern-based similarity search for microarray data,Haixun Wang; Jian Pei; Philip S Yu,Abstract One fundamental task in near-neighbor search as well as other similarity matchingefforts is to find a distance function that can efficiently quantify the similarity between twoobjects in a meaningful way. In DNA microarray analysis; the expression levels of twoclosely related genes may rise and fall synchronously in response to a set of experimentalstimuli. Although the magnitude of their expression levels may not be close; the patterns theyexhibit can be very similar. Unfortunately; none of the conventional distance metrics such asthe L p norm can model this similarity effectively. In this paper; we study the near-neighborsearch problem based on this new type of similarity. We propose to measure the distancebetween two genes by subspace pattern similarity; ie; whether they exhibit a synchronouspattern of rise and fall on a subset of dimensions.

Link-based hidden attribute discovery for objects on web,Jiuming Huang; Haixun Wang; Yan Jia; Ariel Fuxman,Abstract Information extraction from the Web is of growing importance. Objects on the Webare often associated with many attributes that describe the objects. It is essential to extractthese attributes and map them to their corresponding objects. However; much attributeinformation about an object is hidden in the dynamic user interaction and is not on the Webpage that describes the object. Existing information extraction approaches focus on gettinginformation from the object Web page only; which means a lot of attribute information is lost.In this paper; we study the dynamic user interaction on exploratory search Websites andpropose a novel link-based approach to discover attributes and map them to objects.

Non-treelabels are then assigned to each node in the spanning tree that is connected to anothernode in the spanning tree by a non-tree link. From these labels; reachability of any twonodes in the spanning tree is determined by using only the interval-based labels and thenon-tree labels.,*,2009,6

Improving performance of bicluster discovery in a large data set,Jiong Yang; Wei Wang; Haixun Wang; Philip Yu,Microarrays are one of the latest breakthroughs in experimental molecular biology; whichprovide a powerful tool by which the expression patterns of thousands of genes can bemonitored simultaneously and are already producing huge amount of valuable data.Analysis of such data is becoming one of the major bottlenecks in the utilization of thetechnology. The gene expression data are organized as matrices| tables where rowsrepresent genes; columns represent various samples such as tissues or experimentalconditions; and numbers in each cell characterize the expression level of the particular genein the particular sample. Investigations show that more often than not; several genescontribute to a disease; which motivates researchers to identify a subset of genes whoseexpression levels rise and fall coherently under a subset of conditions; that is; they exhibit …,6th ACM International Conference on Research in Computational Molecular Biology; Poster,2002,6
G-SQL: fast query processing via graph exploration,Hongbin Ma; Bin Shao; Yanghua Xiao; Liang Jeff Chen; Haixun Wang,Abstract A lot of real-life data are of graph nature. However; it is not until recently thatbusiness begins to exploit data's connectedness for business insights. On the other hand;RDBMSs are a mature technology for data management; but they are not for graphprocessing. Take graph traversal; a common graph operation for example; it heavily relieson a graph primitive that accesses a given node's neighborhood. We need to join tablesfollowing foreign keys to access the nodes in the neighborhood if an RDBMS is used tomanage graph data. Graph exploration is a fundamental building block of many graphalgorithms. But this simple operation is costly due to a large volume of I/O caused by themassive amount of table joins. In this paper; we present G-SQL; our effort toward theintegration of a RDBMS and a native in-memory graph processing engine. G-SQL …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,5
Proxies for shortest path and distance queries,Shuai Ma; Kaiyu Feng; Jianxin Li; Haixun Wang; Gao Cong; Jinpeng Huai,Computing shortest paths and distances is one of the fundamental problems on graphs; andit remains a challenging task today. This article investigates a light-weight data reductiontechnique for speeding-up shortest path and distance queries on large graphs. To do this;we propose a notion of routing proxies (or simply proxies); each of which represents a smallsubgraph; referred to as deterministic routing areas (DRAs). We first show that routingproxies hold good properties for speeding-up shortest path and distance queries. Then; wedesign a linear-time algorithm to compute routing proxies and their corresponding DRAs.Finally; we experimentally verify that our solution is a general technique for reducing graphsizes and speeding-up shortest path and distance queries; using real-life large graphs.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,5
Transfer understanding from head queries to tail queries,Yangqiu Song; Haixun Wang; Weizhu Chen; Shusen Wang,Abstract One of the biggest challenges of commercial search engines is how to handle tailqueries; or queries that occur very infrequently. Frequent queries; also known as headqueries; are easier to handle largely because their intents are evidenced by abundant click-through data (query logs). Tail queries have little historical data to rely on; which makesthem difficult to be learned by ranking algorithms. In this paper; we leverage knowledge fromtwo resources to fill the gap. The first is a general knowledgebase containing differentgranularities of concepts automatically harnessed from the Web. The second is the click-through data for head queries. From the click-through data; we obtain an understanding ofqueries that trigger clicks. Then; we show that by extracting single or multi-word expressionsfrom both head and tail queries and mapping them to a common concept space defined …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2014,5
Hub-accelerator: Fast and exact shortest path computation in large social networks,Ruoming Jin; Ning Ruan; Bo You; Haixun Wang,Abstract: Shortest path computation is one of the most fundamental operations for managingand analyzing large social networks. Though existing techniques are quite effective forfinding the shortest path on large but sparse road networks; social graphs have quitedifferent characteristics: they are generally non-spatial; non-weighted; scale-free; and theyexhibit small-world properties in addition to their massive size. In particular; the existence ofhubs; those vertices with a large number of connections; explodes the search space; makingthe shortest path computation surprisingly challenging. In this paper; we introduce a set ofnovel techniques centered around hubs; collectively referred to as the Hub-Acceleratorframework; to compute the k-degree shortest path (finding the shortest path between twovertices if their distance is within k). These techniques enable us to significantly reduce …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1305.0507,2013,5
Simultaneous Determination of Sweeteners and Preservatives by Ion Chromatography Method [J],Jing LI; Yu WANG; Li-na LIANG,A simultaneous determination method for three sweeteners (sodium cyclamate; potassiumacesulfame and sodium saccharin) and two preservatives (potassium sorbate and sodiumbenzoate) in food was established. Samples were directly diluted or extracted with water;followed by clean-up on Cleanert C18 column for removing organic impurities. Thechromatographic separation of these additives was carried out on low hydrophobic IonPacAS17-C anion-exchange column using KOH solution as eluent by a two-step isocraticelution procedure. Detection was performed using a conductivity detector. Five kinds ofadditives could not be adsorbed by the clean-up column and high recovery rate wasachieved when the pH of sample solution was adjusted to 9-10 prior to loading. Thisdeveloped method is rapid; sensitive; accurate and reliable and therefore suitable for …,Food Science,2011,5
Simultaneous determination of iodide and thiocyanate powdered milk using ion chromatography with mixed-mode column,Jing Li; Yu Wang; Lina Liang,Abstract The contents of iodide and thiocyanate are important detection items in powderedmilk quality testing. Due to the complexity of the powdered milk matrix; chromatographicanalysis is easily subjected to interference. Acclaim Mixed-Mode WAX-1 columnincorporated both hydrophobic and weak anion-exchange properties was used to separateiodide and thiocyanate from interfering substances in powdered milk matrix; and detected byUltraviolet (UV) detection. After powdered milk was dissolved in water; the protein wasprecipitated by acetonitrile. Then OnGuard RP pre-treatment column was used to removethe organic matters which might pollute the column. The eluent was acetonitrile-100 mmol/Lphosphate buffer (pH 6)-water (45: 5: 50; v/v/v).

Inverse time dependency in convex regularized learning,Zeyuan Allen Zhu; Weizhu Chen; Chenguang Zhu; Gang Wang; Haixun Wang; Zheng Chen,In the conventional regularized learning; training time increases as the training set expands.Recent work on L2 linear SVM challenges this common sense by proposing the inverse timedependency on the training set size. In this paper; we first put forward a Primal GradientSolver (PGS) to effectively solve the convex regularized learning problem. This solver isbased on the stochastic gradient descent method and the Fenchel conjugate adjustment;employing the well-known online strongly convex optimization algorithm with logarithmicregret. We then theoretically prove the inverse dependency property of our PGS; embracingthe previous work of the L2 linear SVM as a special case and enable the l_p-normoptimization to run within a bounded sphere; which qualifies more convex loss functions inPGS. We further illustrate this solver in three examples: SVM; logistic regression and …,Data Mining; 2009. ICDM'09. Ninth IEEE International Conference on,2009,5
Eutectic solidification in Al-13.0% Si alloys with combined addition of strontium and boron,Hengcheng Liao; Ke Ding; Juanjuan Bi; Min Zhang; Huipin Wang Lei Zhao,Abstract The influence of addition of boron (B) on eutectic solidification in a near-eutectic Al-13.0% Si alloy modified with strontium (Sr) was investigated using thermal analysis andmacro/microstructure observation. Addition of B in the Sr-modified alloy leads to aconsiderable increase in nucleation temperature (TN; the minimum temperature prior torecalescence (TM) and growth temperature (TG). In the Sr-modified alloy; nucleation ofeutectic might originate at the heterogeneous sites on the mold wall or in the melt near thewall; and eutectic solidification proceeds gradually towards the center; controlled byundercooling of melt. However; with addition of B in the Sr-modified alloy; undercoolingrequired for eutectic nucleation became small; and hence eutectic solidification might occuralmost simultaneously within whole casting; controlled by amount of heterogeneous sites …,Journal of Materials Sciences and Technology,2009,5
Weighted proximity best-joins for information retrieval,Risi Thonangi; Hao He; AnHai Doan; Haixun Wang; Jun Yang,We consider the problem of efficiently computing weighted proximity best-joins over multiplelists; with applications in information retrieval and extraction. We are given a multi-termquery; and for each query term; a list of all its matches with scores; sorted by locations. Theproblem is to find the overall best matchset; consisting of one match from each list; such thatthe combined score according to a scoring function is maximized. We study three types offunctions that consider both individual match scores and proximity of match locations inscoring a matchset. We present algorithms that exploit the properties of the scoring functionsin order to achieve time complexities linear in the size of the match lists. Experiments showthat these algorithms greatly outperform the naive algorithm based on taking the crossproduct of all match lists.

The user haslittle interaction with the system and no control over the final accuracy and training time. If theaccuracy of the produced model is too low; all the computing resources are misspent. In thispaper we propose a progressive modeling framework. In progressive modeling; the learningalgorithm estimates online both the accuracy of the final model and remaining training time.If the estimated accuracy is far below expectation; the user can terminate training prior tocompletion without wasting further resources. If the user chooses to complete the learningprocess; progressive modeling will compute a model with expected accuracy in expectedtime.

Verb Pattern: A Probabilistic Semantic Representation on Verbs.,Wanyun Cui; Xiyou Zhou; Hangyu Lin; Yanghua Xiao; Haixun Wang; Seung-won Hwang; Wei Wang,Abstract Verbs are important in semantic understanding of natural language. Traditionalverb representations; such as FrameNet; PropBank; VerbNet; focus on verbs' roles. Theseroles are too coarse to represent verbs' semantics. In this paper; we introduce verb patternsto represent verbs' semantics; such that each pattern corresponds to a single semantic of theverb. First we analyze the principles for verb patterns: generality and specificity. Then wepropose a nonparametric model based on description length. Experimental results prove thehigh effectiveness of verb patterns. We further apply verb patterns to context-awareconceptualization; to show that verb patterns are helpful in semantic-related tasks.,AAAI,2016,4
Automatic taxonomy construction from keywords via scalable bayesian rose trees,Yangqiu Song; Shixia Liu; Xueqing Liu; Haixun Wang,In this paper; we study a challenging problem of deriving a taxonomy from a set of keywordphrases. A solution can benefit many real-world applications because i) keywords giveusers the flexibility and ease to characterize a specific domain; and ii) in many applications;such as online advertisements; the domain of interest is already represented by a set ofkeywords. However; it is impossible to create a taxonomy out of a keyword set itself. Weargue that additional knowledge and context are needed. To this end; we first use a general-purpose knowledgebase and keyword search to supply the required knowledge andcontext. Then; we develop a Bayesian approach to build a hierarchical taxonomy for a givenset of keywords. We reduce the complexity of previous hierarchical clustering approachesfrom O (n 2 log n) to O (n log n) using a nearest-neighbor-based approximation; so that …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,4
Concept-based web search,Yue Wang; Hongsong Li; Haixun Wang; Kenny Q Zhu,Abstract Traditional web search engines are keyword-based. Such a mechanism is effectivewhen the user knows exactly the right words in the web pages they are looking for. However;it doesn't produce good results if the user asks for a concept or topic that has broader andsometimes ambiguous meanings. In this paper; we present a framework that improves websearch experiences through the use of a probabilistic knowledge base. The frameworkclassifies web queries into different patterns according to the concepts and entities inaddition to keywords contained in these queries. Then it produces answers by interpretingthe queries with the help of the knowledge base. Our preliminary results showed that thenew framework is capable of answering various types of concept-based queries with muchhigher user satisfaction; and is therefore a valuable addition to the traditional web search.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2012,4

Weare facing two challenges; the overwhelming volume and the concept drifts of the streamingdata. In this chapter; we introduce a general framework for mining concept-drifting datastreams using weighted ensemble classifiers. We train an ensemble of classification models;such as C4. 5; RIPPER; naive Bayesian; etc.; from sequential chunks of the data stream. Theclassifiers in the ensemble are judiciously weighted based on their expected classificationaccuracy on the test data under the time-evolving environment. Thus; the ensembleapproach improves both the efficiency in learning the model and the accuracy in performingclassification.

Researchers are motivated to identify geneswhose expression levels rise and fall coherently under a set of experimental perturbations;that is; they exhibit fluctuation of a similar shape when conditions change. In this paper; weshow that queries based on pattern correlations against large-scale microarray databasescan be supported by the weighted-sequence model; an index structure designed forsequence matching. A weighted-sequence is a two-dimensional structure where eachelement in the sequence is associated with a weight. We transform the DNA microarray data;as well as pattern-based queries; into weighted-sequences; and use subsequence matchingalgorithms to retrieve from the database all genes that match the query pattern.

A unified framework for answering k closest pairs queries and variants,Muhammad Aamir Cheema; Xuemin Lin; Haixun Wang; Jianmin Wang; Wenjie Zhang,Given a scoring function that computes the score of a pair of objects; a top-$ k $ pairs queryreturns $ k $ pairs with the smallest scores. In this paper; we present a unified framework foranswering generic top-$ k $ pairs queries including $ k $-closest pairs queries; $ k $-furthestpairs queries and their variants. Note that $ k $-closest pairs query is a special case of top-$k $ pairs queries where the scoring function is the distance between the two objects in apair. We are the first to present a unified framework to efficiently answer a broad class of top-$ k $ queries including the queries mentioned above. We present efficient algorithms andprovide a detailed theoretical analysis that demonstrates that the expected performance ofour proposed algorithms is optimal for two dimensional data sets. Furthermore; ourframework does not require pre-built indexes; uses limited main memory and is easy to …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,3
Distance landmarks revisited for road graphs,Shuai Ma; Kaiyu Feng; Haixun Wang; Jianxin Li; Jinpeng Huai,Abstract: Computing shortest distances is one of the fundamental problems on graphs; andremains a {\em challenging} task today.{\em Distance}{\em landmarks} have been recentlystudied for shortest distance queries with an auxiliary data structure; referred to as {\emlandmark}{\em covers}. This paper studies how to apply distance landmarks for fast {\emexact} shortest distance query answering on large road graphs. However; the {\em direct}application of distance landmarks is {\em impractical} due to the high space and time cost.To rectify this problem; we investigate novel techniques that can be seamlessly combinedwith distance landmarks. We first propose a notion of {\em hybrid landmark covers}; arevision of landmark covers. Second; we propose a notion of {\em agents}; each of whichrepresents a small subgraph and holds good properties for fast distance query answering …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1401.2690,2014,3
How to make a semantic network probabilistic,Zhongyuan Wang; Haixun Wang; Yanghua Xiao; Ji-Rong Wen,ABSTRACT Words and phrases associate with each other to form a semantic network.Characterizing such associations is a first step toward understanding natural languages formachines. Psychologists and linguists have used concepts such as typicality and basic levelconceptualization to characterize such associations. However; how to quantify suchconcepts is an open problem. Recently; much work has focused on constructing semanticnetworks from web scale text corpora; which makes it possible for the first time to analyzesuch networks using a data driven approach. In this paper; we introduce measures such astypicality; basic level conceptualization; vagueness; ambiguity; and similarity tosystematically characterize the associations in a semantic network. We use such measuresas the basis for probabilistic semantic inferencing; which enables a wide range of …,TechReport. MSR-TR-2014-59,2014,3
Assessing sparse information extraction using semantic contexts,Peipei Li; Haixun Wang; Hongsong Li; Xindong Wu,Abstract One important assumption of information extraction is that extractions occurringmore frequently are more likely to be correct. Sparse information extraction is challengingbecause no matter how big a corpus is; there are extractions supported by only a smallamount of evidence in the corpus. A pioneering work known as REALM learns HMMs tomodel the context of a semantic relationship for assessing the extractions. This is quite costlyand the semantics revealed for the context are not explicit. In this work; we introduce alightweight; explicit semantic approach for sparse information extraction. We use a largesemantic network consisting of millions of concepts; entities; and attributes to explicitlymodel the context of semantic relationships. Experiments show that our approach improvesthe F-score of extraction by at least 11.2% over state-of-the-art; HMM based approaches …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Conference on information & knowledge management,2013,3
Finding information nebula over large networks,Lijun Chang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Lu Qin; Yuanyuan Zhu; Haixun Wang,Abstract Social and information networks have been extensively studied over years. In thispaper; we concentrate ourselves on a large information network that is composed of entitiesand relationships; where entities are associated with sets of keyword terms (kterms) tospecify what they are; and relationships describe the link structure among entities which canbe very complex. Our work is motivated but is different from the existing works that find a bestsubgraph to describe how user-specified entities are connected. We compute informationnebula (cloud) which is a set of top-K kterms P that are most correlated to a set of user-specified kterms Q; over a large information network. Our goal is to find how kterms arecorrelated given the complex information network among entities.

User-directed exploration of mining space with multiple attributes,Chang-Shing Perng; Haixun Wang; Sheng Ma; Joseph L Hellerstein,There has been a growing interest in mining frequent itemsets in relational data with multipleattributes. A key step in this approach is to select a set of attributes that group data intotransactions and a separate set of attributes that labels data into items. Unsupervised andunrestricted mining; however is stymied by the combinatorial complexity and the quantity ofpatterns as the number of attributes grows. In this paper we focus on leveraging thesemantics of the underlying data for mining frequent itemsets. For instance; there are usuallytaxonomies in the data schema and functional dependencies among the attributes. Domainknowledge and user preferences often have the potential to significantly reduce theexponentially growing mining space. These observations motivate the design of a user-directed data mining framework that allows such domain knowledge to guide the mining …,Data Mining; 2002. ICDM 2003.

Landmark: a new technique for similarity-based pattern querying in time series databases,Chang-Shing Perng; Haixun Wang; S Zhang; D Stott Parker,Abstract In this paper we present Landmark; a new technique for similarity-based time seriespattern querying. Landmark does not follow traditional similarity models which rely on thepoint-wise Euclidean distance function. Instead; it employs Landmark Similarity; a newsimilarity model based on human intuition and episodic memory. We show that LandmarkSimilarity is more general than Euclidean-based similarity model. The Landmark isapplicable even under six transformations; namely; Shifting; Uniform Amplitude Scaling;Uniform Time Scaling; Uniform Bi-scaling; Time Warping and Non-uniform AmplitudeScaling. A method of identifying features that are invariant under these transformations isproposed. We also discuss a generalized approach for removing noise from raw time serieswithout smoothing out the peaks and bottoms. Beside the new capabilities; our …,Proceedings; ICDE,2000,3
Scaling up Markov logic probabilistic inference for social graphs,Haiquan Chen; Wei-Shinn Ku; Haixun Wang; Liang Tang; Min-Te Sun,Link prediction is a fundamental problem in social network analysis. Although the linkprediction problem is not new; the challenge of how to exploit various existing networkinformation; such as network structure data and node attribute data; to enable AI-styleknowledge inference for large social networks still remains unsolved. In this paper; wedesign and implement a scalable framework that treats link prediction as knowledgereasoning using Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). Differing from other probabilistic graphicalmodels; MLNs allow undirected relationships with cycles and long-range (non-adjacent)dependency; which are essential and abound in social networks. In our framework; the priorknowledge is captured as the structure dependency (such as friendship) and the attributedependency (such as social communities) in terms of inference rules; associated with …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,2

Learning Defining Features for Categories.,Bo Xu; Chenhao Xie; Yi Zhang; Yanghua Xiao; Haixun Wang; Wei Wang,Abstract Categories play a fundamental role in human cognition. Defining features (short forDFs) are the key elements to define a category; which enables machines to categorizeobjects. Categories enriched with their DFs significantly improve the machine's ability ofcategorization and benefit many applications built upon categorization. However; definingfeatures can rarely be found for categories in current knowledge bases. Traditional effortssuch as manual construction by domain experts are not practical to find defining features formillions of categories. In this paper; we make the first attempt to automatically find definingfeatures for millions of categories in the real world. We formalize the defining featurelearning problem and propose a bootstrapping solution to learn defining features from thefeatures of entities belonging to a category.

Fine-Grained Semantic Conceptualization of FrameNet.,Jin-woo Park; Seung-won Hwang; Haixun Wang,Abstract Understanding verbs is essential for many natural language tasks. To this end;large-scale lexical resources such as FrameNet have been manually constructed toannotate the semantics of verbs (frames) and their arguments (frame elements or FEs) inexample sentences. Our goal is to “semantically conceptualize” example sentences byconnecting FEs to knowledge base (KB) concepts. For example; connecting Employer FE tocompany concept in the KB enables the understanding that any (unseen) company can alsobe FE examples. However; a naive adoption of existing KB conceptualization technique;focusing on scenarios of conceptualizing a few terms; cannot 1) scale to many FE instances(average of 29.7 instances for all FEs) and 2) leverage interdependence between instancesand concepts. We thus propose a scalable k-truss clustering and a Markov Random Field …,AAAI,2016,2
Syntactic Parsing of Web Queries,Xiangyan Sun; Haixun Wang; Yanghua Xiao; Zhongyuan Wang,Abstract Syntactic parsing of web queries is important for query understanding. However;web queries usually do not observe the grammar of a written language; and no labeledsyntactic trees for web queries are available. In this paper; we focus on a query's clickedsentence; ie; a well-formed sentence that i) contains all the tokens of the query; and ii)appears in the query's top clicked web pages. We argue such sentences are semanticallyconsistent with the query. We introduce algorithms to derive a query's syntactic structurefrom the dependency trees of its clicked sentences. This gives us a web query treebankwithout manual labeling. We then train a dependency parser on the treebank. Our modelachieves much better UAS (0.86) and LAS (0.80) scores than state-of-the-art parsers on webqueries.,Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2016,2

Various indexschemes have been proposed for top-k spatial-keyword queries; however; a unifiedframework covering all these schemes has not been proposed. In this paper; we present ageneric model of index schemes for top-k spatial-keyword queries; which we call G-IndexModel. First; G-Index Model is a unified framework that exhaustively investigates all thepossible index schemes for top-k spatial-keyword queries. For this; we conjecture that dataclustering is the key element in composing various index schemes and generate indexschemes as combinations of clustering.

Overcoming Semantic Drift in Information Extraction.,Zhixu Li; Hongsong Li; Haixun Wang; Yi Yang; Xiangliang Zhang; Xiaofang Zhou,ABSTRACT Semantic drift is a common problem in iterative information extraction. Previousapproaches for minimizing semantic drift may incur substantial loss in recall. We observethat most semantic drifts are introduced by a small number of questionable extractions in theearlier rounds of iterations. These extractions subsequently introduce a large number ofquestionable results; which lead to the semantic drift phenomenon. We call thesequestionable extractions Drifting Points (DPs). If erroneous extractions are the “symptoms” ofsemantic drift; then DPs are the “causes” of semantic drift. In this paper; we propose amethod to minimize semantic drift by identifying the DPs and removing the effect introducedby the DPs. We use isA (concept-instance) extraction as an example to demonstrate theeffectiveness of our approach in cleaning information extraction errors caused by …,EDBT,2014,2

Modeling and querying E-commerce data in hybrid relational-XML DBMSs,Lipyeow Lim; Haixun Wang; Min Wang,Abstract Data in many industrial application systems are often neither completely structurednor unstructured. Consequently semi-structured data models such as XML have becomepopular as a lowest common denominator to manage such data. The problem is thatalthough XML is adequate to represent the flexible portion of the data; it fails to exploit thehighly structured portion of the data. XML normalization theory could be used to factor outthe structured portion of the data at the schema level; however; queries written against theoriginal schema no longer run on the normalized XML data. In this paper; we propose a newapproach called eXtricate that stores XML documents in a space-efficient decomposed waywhile supporting efficient processing on the original queries.

Estimating the selectivity of XML path expression with predicates by histograms,Yu Wang; Haixun Wang; Xiaofeng Meng; Shan Wang,Abstract Selectivity estimation of path expressions in querying XML data plays an importantrole in query optimization. A path expression may contain multiple branches with predicates;each of which having its impact on the selectivity of the entire query. In this paper; wepropose a novel method based on 2-dimensional value histograms to estimate theselectivity of path expressions embedded with predicates. The value histograms capture thecorrelation between the structures and the values in the XML data. We define a set ofoperations on the value histograms as well as on the traditional histograms that capturenodes positional distribution. We then construct a cost tree based on such operations. Theselectivity of any node (or branch) in a path expression can be estimated by executing thecost tree. Compared with previous methods (which ignore value distribution) our method …,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2004,2

Probase+: Inferring Missing Links in Conceptual Taxonomies,Jiaqing Liang; Yanghua Xiao; Haixun Wang; Yi Zhang; Wei Wang,Much work has focused on automatically constructing conceptual taxonomies or semanticnetworks from large text corpora. In this paper; we use a state-of-the-art data-drivenconceptual taxonomy; Probase; to show that missing links in taxonomies are the chiefproblem that hinders their adoption by many real life applications; for the missing links breakthe inferencing that the conceptual taxonomy claims to support. To solve this problem; wedevise a collaborative filtering framework to infer missing links in taxonomies derived fromtext corpora. We implement our method mainly on Probase; creating a denser taxonomycontaining 5.1 million (about 30 percent) more isA relationships; with an accuracy of above90 percent. We conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the quality of therevised conceptual taxonomies.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,1
Graph-Based Wrong IsA Relation Detection in a Large-Scale Lexical Taxonomy.,Jiaqing Liang; Yanghua Xiao; Yi Zhang; Seung-won Hwang; Haixun Wang,Abstract Knowledge base (KB) plays an important role in artificial intelligence. Much efforthas been taken to both manually and automatically construct web-scale knowledge bases.Comparing with manually constructed KBs; automatically constructed KB is broader but withmore noises. In this paper; we study the problem of improving the quality for automaticallyconstructed web-scale knowledge bases; in particular; lexical taxonomies of isArelationships. We find that these taxonomies usually contain cycles; which are oftenintroduced by incorrect isA relations. Inspired by this observation; we introduce two kinds ofmodels to detect incorrect isA relations from cycles. The first one eliminates cycles byextracting directed acyclic graphs; and the other one eliminates cycles by grouping nodesinto different levels. We implement our models on Probase; a state-of-the-art …,AAAI,2017,1
On the Transitivity of Hypernym-Hyponym Relations in Data-Driven Lexical Taxonomies.,Jiaqing Liang; Yi Zhang; Yanghua Xiao; Haixun Wang; Wei Wang; Pinpin Zhu,Abstract Taxonomy is indispensable in understanding natural language. A variety of largescale; usage-based; data-driven lexical taxonomies have been constructed in recent years.Hypernym-hyponym relationship; which is considered as the backbone of lexicaltaxonomies can not only be used to categorize the data but also enables generalization. Inparticular; we focus on one of the most prominent properties of the hypernym-hyponymrelationship; namely; transitivity; which has a significant implication for many applications.We show that; unlike human crafted ontologies and taxonomies; transitivity does not alwayshold in data-driven lexical taxonomies. We introduce a supervised approach to detectwhether transitivity holds for any given pair of hypernym-hyponym relationships.

Semantic Bootstrapping: A Theoretical Perspective,Wentao Wu; Hongsong Li; Haixun Wang; Kenny Q Zhu,Knowledge acquisition is an iterative process. Most previous work has focused onbootstrapping techniques based on syntactic patterns; that is; each iteration finds moresyntactic patterns for subsequent extraction. However; syntactic bootstrapping is incapableof resolving the inherent ambiguities in the syntactic patterns. The precision of the extractedresults is thus often poor. On the other hand; semantic bootstrapping bootstraps directly onknowledge rather than on syntactic patterns; that is; it uses existing knowledge tounderstand the text and acquire more knowledge. It has been shown that semanticbootstrapping can achieve superb precision while retaining good recall. Nonetheless; theworking mechanism of semantic bootstrapping remains elusive. In this paper; we present adetailed analysis of semantic bootstrapping from a theoretical perspective. We show that …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,1
KBQA: learning question answering over QA corpora and knowledge bases,Wanyun Cui; Yanghua Xiao; Haixun Wang; Yangqiu Song; Seung-won Hwang; Wei Wang,Abstract Question answering (QA) has become a popular way for humans to access billion-scale knowledge bases. Unlike web search; QA over a knowledge base gives out accurateand concise results; provided that natural language questions can be understood andmapped precisely to structured queries over the knowledge base. The challenge; however;is that a human can ask one question in many different ways. Previous approaches havenatural limits due to their representations: rule based approaches only understand a smallset of" canned" questions; while keyword based or synonym based approaches cannot fullyunderstand the questions. In this paper; we design a new kind of question representation:templates; over a billion scale knowledge base and a million scale QA corpora. Forexample; for questions about a city's population; we learn templates such as What's the …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,1
Entity suggestion with conceptual explanation,Yi Zhang; Yanghua Xiao; Seung-won Hwang; Haixun Wang; X Sean Wang; Wei Wang,Abstract Entity Suggestion with Conceptual Explanation (ESC) refers to a type of entityacquisition query in which a user provides a set of example entities as the query and obtainsin return not only some related entities but also concepts which can best explain the queryand the result. ESC is useful in many applications such as related-entity recommendationand query expansion. Many example based entity suggestion solutions are available inexisting literatures. However; they are generally not aware of the concepts of query entitiesthus cannot be used for conceptual explanation. In this paper; we propose two probabilisticentity suggestion models and their computation solutions. Our models and solutions fullytake advantage of the large scale taxonomies which consist of isA relations between entitiesand concepts.

Unsupervised head--modifier detection in search queries,Zhongyuan Wang; Fang Wang; Haixun Wang; Zhirui Hu; Jun Yan; Fangtao Li; Ji-Rong Wen; Zhoujun Li,Abstract Interpreting the user intent in search queries is a key task in query understanding.Query intent classification has been widely studied. In this article; we go one step further tounderstand the query from the view of head--modifier analysis. For example; given the query“popular iphone 5 smart cover;” instead of using coarse-grained semantic classes (eg; findelectronic product); we interpret that “smart cover” is the head or the intent of the query and“iphone 5” is its modifier. Query head--modifier detection can help search engines to obtainparticularly relevant content; which is also important for applications such as ads matchingand query recommendation. We introduce an unsupervised semantic approach for queryhead--modifier detection. First; we mine a large number of instance level head--modifierpairs from search log. Then; we develop a conceptualization mechanism to generalize …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2016,1
Extending relational query languages for data streams,Nikolay Laptev; Barzan Mozafari; Hamid Mousavi; Hetal Thakkar; Haixun Wang; Kai Zeng; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract The design of continuous query languages for data streams and the extent to whichthese should rely on database query languages represent pivotal issues for data streammanagement systems (DSMSs). The Expressive Stream Language (ESL) of our Stream Millsystem is designed to maximize the spectrum of applications a DSMS can support efficiently;while retaining compatibility with the SQL: 2003 standards. This approach offers significantadvantages; particularly for the many applications that span both data streams anddatabases. Therefore; ESL supports minimal extensions required to overcome SQL'sexpressive power limitations—a critical enhancement since said limitations are quite severeon database applications and are further exacerbated on data stream applications; where;eg; only nonblocking query operators can be used. Thus; ESL builds on user-defined …,*,2016,1
Entity suggestion by example using a conceptual taxonomy,Yi Zhang; Yanghua Xiao; Seung-won Hwang; Haixun Wang; X Sean Wang; Wei Wang,Abstract: Entity suggestion by example (ESbE) refers to a type of entity acquisition query inwhich a user provides a set of example entities as the query and obtains in return someentities that best complete the concept underlying the given query. Such entity acquisitionqueries can be useful in many applications such as related-entity recommendation andquery expansion. A number of ESbE query processing solutions exist in the literature.However; they mostly build only on the idea of entity co-occurrences either in text or weblists; without taking advantage of the existence of many web-scale conceptual taxonomiesthat consist of hierarchical isA relationships between entity-concept pairs. This paperprovides a query processing method based on the relevance models between entity setsand concepts. These relevance models can be used to obtain the fine-grained concepts …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.08996,2015,1

Toward Query-centric Web Modeling and Crawling,Jiuming Huang; Haixun Wang; Ariel Fuxman; Yan Jia,ABSTRACT Crawling and information extraction is perhaps one of the most extensivelystudied topics in the web age. Albeit much progress has been made in this area; it is still apage-centric; computation intensive process; and more often than not; it relies on manuallycrafted templates. But how a web site organizes its data has gone through significantchanges since the early days of web; and many web sites; especially e-commerce sites; nowsupport exploratory search; which presents data to the user through an implicit queryinterface. In this paper; we conduct a comprehensive survey of exploratory web sites; andwe show that traditional page-centric crawling is extremely wasteful and the crawled data isseriously incomplete. We propose a query-centric view of web data; and an automaticcrawling framework that crawls web sites by queries instead of by pages. In essence; we …,椅 Proceedings of,2011,1

Semantic query by example,Lipyeow Lim; Haixun Wang; Min Wang,ABSTRACT Supporting semantic queries in relational databases is essential to manyadvanced applications. Recently; with the increasing use of ontology in various applications;the need for querying relational data togther with its related ontology has become moreurgent. In this paper; we identify two fundamental challenges in this task. First; it is extremelydifficult to express queries against graph structured ontology in the relational querylanguage SQL; and second; in many cases where data and its related ontology arecomplicated; queries are usually not precise; that is; users often have only a vague notion;rather than a clear understanding and definition; of what they query for. To address the twochallenges; we introduce a novel method that enables us to support semantic queries inrelational databases with ease.

On mining maximal pattern-based clusters,Jian Pei; Xiaoling Zhang; Moonjung Cho; Haixun Wang; S Yu Philip,Pattern-based clustering is important in many applications; such as DNA micro-array dataanalysis in bio-informatics; as well as automatic recommendation systems and targetmarketing systems in e-business. However; pattern-based clustering in large databases isstill challenging. On the one hand; there can be a huge number of clusters and many of themcan be redundant and thus make the pattern-based clustering ineffective. On the other hand;the previous proposed methods may not be efficient or scalable in mining large databases.In this paper; we study the problem of maximal pattern-based clustering. The major idea isthat the redundant clusters are avoided completely by mining only the maximal pattern-based clusters. We show that maximal pattern-based clusters are skylines of all pattern-based clusters. Two efficient algorithms; MaPle and MaPle+ (MaPle is for Maximal Pattern …,*,2009,1

The ATLaS system and its powerful database language based on simple extensions of SQL,Haixun Wang; Carlo Zaniolo,A lack of power and extensibility in their query languages has seriously limited the generalityof DBMSs and hampered their ability to support new applications domains; such as datamining. In this paper; we solve this problem by stream-oriented aggregate functions andgeneralized table functions which are definable by users in the SQL language itself; ratherthan in an external programming language. These simple extensions turn SQL into apowerful database language; which can express a wide range of applications; includingrecursive queries; ROLAP (relational online analytical processing) aggregates; time-seriesqueries; stream-oriented processing and data-mining functions. The SQL extensions areimplemented in ATLaS (Aggregate and Table Language and System).,Data Engineering; 2002. Proceedings. 18th International Conference on,2002,1
Scanning Tunnelling Microscope Tip-Induced Reconstruction on Si (111)(3) 1/2×(3) 1/2 R30°-Ag Surface,Li Bin; Zeng Chang-Gan; Wang Hai-Qian; Wang Bing; Hou Jian-Guo,Abstract The reconstruction process of the Si (111)(3) 1/2×(3) 1/2 R30-Ag surface is studiedby using a scanning tunnelling microscope at 78 K. By applying a strong interaction betweenthe tip and the surface; a tip-induced reconstruction corresponding to the mergence of two Si(111)(3) 1/2×(3) 1/2 R30-Ag domains is observed. Based on the inequivalent trimers (IET)model; this reconstruction process is attributed to a transition between the clockwise andcounterclockwise IET domains. With this transition; the honeycomb-chained-trimer Si(111)(3) 1/2×(3) 1/2 R30-Ag anti-phase boundary disappears and changes to the IETstructure.,Chinese Physics Letters,2001,1

Disassembly of projectile remnants in a simple dynamics and statistics model,Sa Ben-Hao; Zheng Yu-Ming; Wang Hui; Zhang Xiao-Ze,Abstract The ALADIN data for the disassembly of projectile remnants in Au+ Au reactions at6 0 0 A MeV are investigated using a simple dynamics and statistics model. Once the modelparameter relevant to the excitation energy is fixed via fitting one datum point in theexperimental correlation curve between the mean multiplicity of IMF and the Z bound; notonly this full correlation curve but also all the experimental charge correlations arereproduced nicely. The data of the size of projectile remnant and of the excitation energy pernucleon as functions of Z bound are reproduced as well. Meanwhile; the theoretical relativeyield of the decay mode of projectile remnant as a function of Z bound is comparable withthe experimental ones. In addition; the theoretical caloric curve of projectile remnants is alsosimilar to the ALADIN ones. However; it is premature to conclude that the ALADIN caloric …,Physical Review C,1998,1

Automatic Navbox Generation by Interpretable Clustering over Linked Entities,Chenhao Xie; Lihan Chen; Jiaqing Liang; Kezun Zhang; Yanghua Xiao; Hanghang Tong; Haixun Wang; Wei Wang,Abstract Rare efforts have been devoted to generating the structured Navigation Box(Navbox) for Wikipedia articles. A Navbox is a table in Wikipedia article page that provides aconsistent navigation system for related entities. Navbox is critical for the readership andediting efficiency of Wikipedia. In this paper; we target on the automatic generation ofNavbox for Wikipedia articles. Instead of performing information extraction over unstructurednatural language text directly; an alternative avenue is explored by focusing on a rich set ofsemi-structured data in Wikipedia articles: linked entities. The core idea of this paper is asfollows: If we cluster the linked entities and interpret them appropriately; we can construct ahigh-quality Navbox for the article entity. We propose a clustering-then-labeling algorithm torealize the idea. Experiments show that the proposed solutions are effective.

Answering Natural Language Questions by Subgraph Matching over Knowledge Graphs,Sen Hu; Lei Zou; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Haixun Wang; Dongyan Zhao,RDF question/answering (Q/A) allows users to ask questions in natural languages over aknowledge base represented by RDF. To answer a national language question; the existingwork takes a two-stage approach: question understanding and query evaluation. Their focusis on question understanding to deal with the disambiguation of the natural languagephrases. The most common technique is the joint disambiguation; which has the exponentialsearch space. In this paper; we propose a systematic framework to answer natural languagequestions over RDF repository (RDF Q/A) from a graph data-driven perspective. We proposea semantic query graph to model the query intention in the natural language question in astructural way; based on which; RDF Q/A is reduced to subgraph matching problem.

Fast Relevance Discovery in Time Series,Chang-shing Perng; Haixun Wang; Sheng Ma,In this paper; we propose to model time series from a new angle: state transition points.When fluctuation of values in a time series crosses a certain point; it may trigger statetransition in the system; which may lead to abrupt changes in many other time series. Theconcept of state transition points is essential in understanding the behavior of the time seriesand the behavior of the system. The new measure is robust and is capable of discoveringcorrelations that Pearson's coefficient cannot reveal. We propose efficient algorithms toidentify state transition points and to compute correlation between two time series. We alsointroduce some triangular inequalities to efficiently find highly correlated time series amongmany time series.,Data Mining; 2006. ICDM'06. Sixth International Conference on,2006,*
LOCI: Load Shedding through Class-Preserving Data Acquisition,Peng Wang; Haixun Wang; Wei Wang; Baile Shi; S Yu Philip,An avalanche of data available in the stream form is overstretching our data analyzingability. In this paper; we propose a novel load shedding method that enables fast andaccurate stream data classification. We transform input data so that its class informationconcentrates on a few features; and we introduce a progressive classifier that makesprediction with partial input. We take advantage of stream data's temporal locality-forexample; readings from a temperature sensor usually do not change dramatically over ashort period of time-for load shedding. We first show that temporal locality of the original datais preserved by our transform; then we utilize positive and negative knowledge about thedata (which is of much smaller size than the data itself) for classification. We employ bothanalytical and empirical analysis to demonstrate the advantage of our approach.,Data Mining; 2006. ICDM'06. Sixth International Conference on,2006,*

How to realize maximum mining benefits under resourceconstraints becomes a challenging task. In this paper; we propose a load shedding schemefor classifying multiple data streams. We focus on the following problems: i) how to classifydata that are dropped by the load shedding scheme? and ii) how to decide when to dropdata from a stream? We introduce a quality of decision (QoD) metric to measure the level ofuncertainty in classification when exact feature values of the data are not available becauseof load shedding. A Markov model is used to predict the distribution of feature values and wemake classification decisions using the predicted values and the QoD metric.

Time invariance and analysis results keep the same length with that oforiginal signal are some good properties of stationary wavelet transform. Nonlinear energyoperator can enhance signal with high frequency. Spikes can be detected accurately andeasily while applied nonlinear energy operator to the output of stationary wavelet transform;the modified method is particularly suitable for the automatic detecting of small spikes in theseismogram; which is helpful to reduce the false detection ratio of seismic signal.(authors),Nuclear Electronics and Detection Technology,2005,*

Moment,Yun Chi; Haixun Wang; S Yu Philip; Richard R Muntz,Abstract This paper considers the problem of mining closed frequent itemsets over a slidingwindow using limited memory space. We design a synopsis data structure to monitortransactions in the sliding window so that we can output the current closed frequent itemsetsat any time. Due to time and memory constraints; the synopsis data structure cannot monitorall possible itemsets. However; monitoring only frequent itemsets will make it impossible todetect new itemsets when they become frequent. In this paper; we introduce a compact datastructure; the closed enumeration tree (CET); to maintain a dynamically selected set ofitemsets over a sliding-window. The selected itemsets consist of a boundary between closedfrequent itemsets and the rest of the itemsets. Concept drifts in a data stream are reflected byboundary movements in the CET.

δ-clusters,Jiong Yang; Wei Wang; Haixun Wang; Philip Yu,Abstract Clustering has been an active research area of great practical importance for recentyears. Most previous clustering models have focused on grouping objects with similarvalues on a (sub) set of dimensions (eg; subspace cluster) and assumed that every objecthas an associated value on every dimension (eg; bicluster). These existing cluster modelsmay not always be adequate in capturing coherence exhibited among objects. Strongcoherence may still exist among a set of objects (on a subset of attributes) even if they takequite different values on each attribute and the attribute values are not fully specified. This isvery common in many applications including bio-informatics analysis as well ascollaborative filtering analysis; where the data may be incomplete and subject to biases.

The system was used to measure soft X-ray spectra emitted from laser plasmasand good experimental results were obtained. The measured results show that this systemhas properties of good monochromaticity; unfolding simply and high accuracy,Nuclear Techniques,2001,*
Universal mass dependence of final hadron yield in high energy reactions,Ximing Liu; Xuerao Zhang; Hailong Wang,Recently experiments found that multiplicities of final state particles in high energy reactionsand their masses satisfy a simple universal experienced formula. The multiplicities of directlyproduced mesons and baryons in e+ e-annihilation and p-(anti p) reaction are calculatedand are in complete agreement with the parameter in the experienced formula. And theauthors can give a reasonable interpretation of parameters that are relevant to energy. Thereasons of the mass universal relation are discussed,High Energy Physics and Nuclear Physics,2001,*

Nuclear liquid-gas phase transition shown in multifragmentation,Zheng Yuming; Sa Benhao; Wang Hui,Abstract The Incomplete-Fusion-Fragmentation Model has been used to reproduce nicelythe experimental evidence of liquid-gas phase transition probed in the reaction of $ Au+ Au$ at $600 A\MeV $. The analysis of the relative yields of decay modes for the projectileremnant as a function of $\langle Z_ {\rm bound}\rangle $ shows clearly the competition andtransformation processes of various decay modes of projectile remnant with decreasing of$\langle Z_ {\rm bound}\rangle $. The agreement between theoretical and experimentalresults for the analysis of relative yield of decay modes indicates that the experimentalevidence of liquid-gas phase transition is composed of the decay mode transformations.,Communications in theoretical physics,1998,*
Aggregates in Recursive Datalog and SQL3 Queries,Haixun Wang; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract Advanced database applications require user-de ned aggregates that; along withthe nal returns provided by traditional aggregates; also support early returns as needed inonline aggregation and many data mining applications.

In pure Bi-basedsuperconductor; with nominal composition of Bi 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 1 0; the formation of2212 phase obeys the n ucleation and crystal growth self-catalytic reaction model: α 2 2 1 2=1-exp (-k 2 2 1 2 t 2. 5); and the 2223 phase obeys the n ucleous shrinkage model: 1-(1-α 22 2 3) 1= k 2 2 2 3 t in this case; the activation energy for the former is 60kJ. mol-1 higherthan that of the latter; which makes the formation of 2223 phase more difficult.

It disambiguates multi-word expressions (MWEs) in addition to single words. Existing Wikification techniques eithermodels the context of a given term as well as the Wikipedia article as bags of words; orcompute global constraints among Wikipedia concepts by the link graph or link distributions.The first method doesn't achieve good results because the MWEs can have very differentmeanings than its constituent words which themselves are ambiguous.

Computing Term Similarity by Knowledge from Big Data,Peipei Li; Haixun Wang; Kenny Q Zhu; Zhongyuan Wang; Xindong Wu,ABSTRACT Computing semantic similarity between two terms is essential for a variety of textanalytics and understanding applications. However; existing approaches are more suitablefor semantic similarity between words rather than the more general multi-word expressions(MWEs); and they do not scale very well. Therefore; we propose a lightweight and effectiveapproach for semantic similarity using a large scale semantic network automaticallyacquired from billions of web documents. Given two terms; we map them into the conceptspace; and compare their similarity there. Furthermore; we introduce a clustering approachto orthogonalize the concept space in order to improve the accuracy of the similaritymeasure. Extensive studies demonstrate that our approach can accurately compute thesemantic similarity between terms with MWEs and ambiguity; and significantly …,*,*,*

An Index Structure for Pattern Similarity Searching in DN A Microarray Data,Chang-Shing Perng Wei Fan Philip; S Yu; Haixun Wang,Abstract The DNA microarray technology is about to bring an explosion of gene expressiondata that may dwarf even the human sequencing projects. Researchers are motivated toidentify genes whose expression levels rise and fall coherently under a set of experimentalperturbances; that is; they exhibit fluctuation of a similar shape when conditions change. Inthis paper; we show that queries based on pattern correlations against large-scalemicroarray databases can be supported by the weighted-sequence model; an indexstructure designed for sequence matching. A weighted-sequence is a two-dimensionalstructure where each element in the sequence is associated with a weight. We transform theDNA microarray data; as well as pattern-based queries; into weighted-sequences; and usesubsequence matching algorithms to retrieve from the database all genes that match the …,*,*,*

Many applications require information to be recovered from such data. Forexample; in sensor data processing; errors may occur in collection and transmission; inprivacy-preserving data publishing; only summarized or perturbed data is available foranalysis. Ideally; an approach for information recovery should have the following features.First; it should be able to incorporate prior knowledge about the data; even if suchknowledge is in the form of complex distributions and constraints for which no close-formsolutions exist. Second; it should be able to capture complex correlations and quantify thedegree of uncertainty in the recovered data; and further support queries over such data.

Probase: a Universal Knowledge Base for Semantic Search,Zhongyuan Wang; Jiuming Huang; Hongsong Li; Bin Liu; Bin Shao; Haixun Wang; Jingjing Wang; Yue Wang; Wentao Wu; Jing Xiao; Kenny Q Zhu,ABSTRACT We demonstrate a prototype system that showcases the power of using aknowledge base (Probase) for search. The goal of Probase is to enable common sensecomputing; and its foundation is a universal; probabilistic ontology that is morecomprehensive than any of the existing ontologies. Currently; it contains over 2.7 millionconcepts harnessed automatically from a corpus of 1.68 billion web pages. Unlike traditionalknowledge bases that treat knowledge as black and white; it supports probabilisticinterpretations of the information it contains. The probabilistic nature also enables it toincorporate heterogeneous information in a natural way. Besides the system; we alsodemonstrate two applications; i) semantic web search and ii) understanding and searchingweb tables; that are built on top of the Probase framework. They indicate that a little …,*,*,*
The 4th International Workshop on Mining Multiple Information Sources (MMIS-10),Ruoming Jin; Xingquan Zhu; Haixun Wang; Zoran Obradovic,As data collection sources and channels continuous evolve; mining and correlating informationfrom multiple information sources has become a crucial step in data mining and knowledgediscovery. Several emerging fields and applications from healthcare informatics to environmentalsciences to social computing in particular call for data mining methodologies and approachesto deal with multi-source data. On one hand; comparing patterns from different databases andunderstanding their relationships can be extremely beneficial for these applications. On the otherhand; many data mining and data analysis tasks such as classification; regression; andclustering; can significantly improve their performance if information from different sources canbe properly integrated and leveraged … The aim of this workshop is to bring together data miningexperts to advance research on integrating and mining multiple information sources …,*,*,*

ESL: a Data Stream Query Language and System Designed for Power and Extensibility,Chang Luo; Haixun Wang; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract Applications that span both data streams and databases provide a sound reason forusing SQL for continuous queries on data streams as well as for ad-hoc queries ondatabase tables. However; SQL was designed for persistent data on secondary store; andnot for transient data on the wire; therefore; SQL is facing major problems in this new role—particularly in the domains of expressive power and extensibility that constitute notoriousweakness areas for relational languages. For instance; SQL cannot support sequencequeries; approximate queries; and mining queries that represent important applications fordata stream management systems (DSMS). The fact that blocking operators cannot be usedon continuous queries further impairs the effectiveness of SQL on data streams applications.Our Stream Mill solves these problems with the Expressive Query Language (ESL) …,*,*,*
The S2¹ÌÖ: An Index Structure for Subsequence Matching of Spatial Objects,Haixun Wang; Chang-Shing Perng,Abstract. We present the S2-Tree; an indexing method for subsequence matching of spatialobjects. The S2-Tree locates subsequences within a collection of spatial sequences; ie;sequences made up of spatial objects; such that the subsequences match a given querypattern within a specified tolerance. Our method is based on (i) the string-searchingtechniques that locate substrings within a string of symbols drawn from a discrete alphabet(eg; ASCII characters) and (ii) the spatial access methods that index (unsequenced) spatialobjects. Particularly; the S2-Tree can be applied to solve problems such as subsequencematching of time-series data; where features of subsequences are often extracted andmapped into spatial objects. Moreover; it supports queries such as" what is the longestcommon pattern of the two time series?"; which previous subsequence matching …,*,*,*

ESL: a Very Powerful SQL-Compliant Data Stream Language,Yijian Bai; Chang R Luo; Hetal Thakkar; Haixun Wang; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract Compliance with SQL standards is very desirable for a data stream query languagebecause of practical considerations; and it is also very beneficial for applications that spanboth data streams and data bases. However; SQL suffers from expressive powerimpairments that; on streaming data; are even more serious than those it suffers on storeddata. Our Expressive Stream Language (ESL) solves these problems; and achieves power;flexibility; and adherence to SQL: 2003 standards by using:(i) table expressions andconcrete views on data streams;(ii) non-blocking aggregates (UDAs); and (iii) efficient delta-based maintenance for UDAs on windows. ESL is fully supported in the UCLA Stream MillDSMS and has proven very effective on a wide spectrum of applications that includeapproximate computations; data stream mining; time-series queries; and XML streams.,*,*,*
Power and Extensibility in a Data Stream Query Language and System,Yijian Bai; Hetal Thakkar; Chang Luo; Haixun Wang; Carlo Zaniolo,ABSTRACT Through its Expressive Stream Language (ESL); our Stream Mill systemsupports efficiently a wide range of applications; including very advanced ones such as datastream mining; streaming XML processing; time-series queries; and RFID event processing.Such superior generality and power are achieved by simple SQL extensions that bringwindows and User-Defined Aggregates (UDAs) to levels of support and integration neverachieved in the past. Thus; ESL supports physical and logical windows (with optional slidesand tumbles) on both built-in aggregates and UDAs; using a simple framework that appliesuniformly to both aggregate functions written in a external procedural languages and thosenatively written in ESL. In this paper; we first introduce the main ESL concepts andconstructs and demonstrate their effectiveness in advanced applications; such as data …,*,*,*
IBM TJ Watson Research Center fjiyang; ww1; haixun; psyug@ us. ibm. com,Jiong Yang; Wei Wang; Haixun Wang; Philip Yu,Abstract Clustering has been an active research area of great practical importance for recentyears. Most previous clustering models have focused on grouping objects with similarvalues on a (sub) set of dimensions (eg; subspace cluster) and assumed that every objecthas an associated value on every dimension (eg; bicluster). These existing cluster modelsmay not always be adequate in capturing coherence exhibited among objects. Strongcoherence may still exist among a set of objects (on a subset of attributes) even if they takequite different values on each attribute and the attribute values are not fully specified. This isvery common in many applications including bio-informatics analysis as well ascollaborative filtering analysis; where the data may be incomplete and subject to biases. Inbio-informatics; a bicluster model has recently been proposed to capture coherence …,*,*,*

Aggregates for the Next Generation of Database Systems,Carlo Zaniolo; Haixun Wang,*,*,*,*
User De ned Aggregates in Database Languages,Haixun Wang; Carlo Zaniolo,Abstract User-de ned aggregates can be the linchpin of sophisticated datamining functionsand other advanced database applications; but they nd little support in current databasesystems including Object-Relational databases. Three serious limitations of currentdatabases are (i) the inability of introducing new aggregates (eg; by coding them in aprocedural language as proposed in SQL3);(ii) the inability of returning partial results duringcomputation (eg; to support online aggregation); and (iii) the inability of using aggregates inrecursive queries| eg; to express Bill of Materials (BoM) applications and optimized graphsearches. This paper propose a uni ed solution to these problems; and discusses practicaland theoretical aspects of this powerful addition to database languages.,*,*,*
