General match: a subsequence matching method in time-series databases based on generalized windows,Yang-Sae Moon; Kyu-Young Whang; Wook-Shin Han,Abstract We generalize the method of constructing windows in subsequence matching. Bythis generalization; we can explain earlier subsequence matching methods as special casesof a common framework. Based on the generalization; we propose a new subsequencematching method; General Match. The earlier work by Faloutsos et al.(called FRM forconvenience) causes a lot of false alarms due to lack of point-filtering effect. Dual Match;recently proposed as a dual approach of FRM; improves performance significantly over FRMby exploiting point filtering effect. However; it has the problem of having a smaller allowablewindow size---half that of FRM---given the minimum query length. A smaller windowincreases false alarms due to window size effect. General Match offers advantages of bothmethods: it can reduce window size effect by using large windows like FRM and; at the …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,207
TurboGraph: a fast parallel graph engine handling billion-scale graphs in a single PC,Wook-Shin Han; Sangyeon Lee; Kyungyeol Park; Jeong-Hoon Lee; Min-Soo Kim; Jinha Kim; Hwanjo Yu,Abstract Graphs are used to model many real objects such as social networks and webgraphs. Many real applications in various fields require efficient and effective managementof large-scale graph structured data. Although distributed graph engines such as GBase andPregel handle billion-scale graphs; the user needs to be skilled at managing and tuning adistributed system in a cluster; which is a nontrivial job for the ordinary user. Furthermore;these distributed systems need many machines in a cluster in order to provide reasonableperformance. In order to address this problem; a disk-based parallel graph engine calledGraph-Chi; has been recently proposed. Although Graph-Chi significantly outperforms allrepresentative (disk-based) distributed graph engines; we observe that Graph-Chi still hasserious performance problems for many important types of graph queries due to 1) limited …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,137
Inverted index storage structure using subindexes and large objects for tight coupling of information retrieval with database management systems,*,This invention relates to an inverted index storage structure that indexes keyword inputs intothe storage space for the corresponding posting lists. In particular; the invention relates tothe index structure that enables fast retrieval of the posting of the specific document from theposting list and enables efficient arrangement and maintenance of the posting list indocument identifier (docID) order; so that fast addition; deletion; modification; and retrieval ofdocuments are possible in environments where a database management system is tightlycoupled with information retrieval. The technical solution is to store the posting list in a largeobject and map to each posting list a subindex that indexes the docID into the postingscontaining the docID.,*,2002,134
An in-depth comparison of subgraph isomorphism algorithms in graph databases,Jinsoo Lee; Wook-Shin Han; Romans Kasperovics; Jeong-Hoon Lee,Abstract Finding subgraph isomorphisms is an important problem in many applicationswhich deal with data modeled as graphs. While this problem is NP-hard; in recent years;many algorithms have been proposed to solve it in a reasonable time for real datasets usingdifferent join orders; pruning rules; and auxiliary neighborhood information. However; sincethey have not been empirically compared one another in most research work; it is not clearwhether the later work outperforms the earlier work. Another problem is that reportedcomparisons were often done using the original authors' binaries which were written indifferent programming environments. In this paper; we address these serious problems by re-implementing five state-of-the-art subgraph isomorphism algorithms in a common code baseand by comparing them using many real-world datasets and their query loads.

Turbo iso: towards ultrafast and robust subgraph isomorphism search in large graph databases,Wook-Shin Han; Jinsoo Lee; Jeong-Hoon Lee,Abstract Given a query graph q and a data graph g; the subgraph isomorphism search findsall occurrences of q in g and is considered one of the most fundamental query types formany real applications. While this problem belongs to NP-hard; many algorithms have beenproposed to solve it in a reasonable time for real datasets. However; a recent study hasshown; through an extensive benchmark with various real datasets; that all existingalgorithms have serious problems in their matching order selection. Furthermore; allalgorithms blindly permutate all possible mappings for query vertices; often leading touseless computations. In this paper; we present an efficient and robust subgraph searchsolution; called Turbo ISO; which is turbo-charged with two novel concepts; candidate regionexploration and the combine and permute strategy (in short; Comb/Perm). The candidate …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,98
Ranked subsequence matching in time-series databases,Wook-Shin Han; Jinsoo Lee; Yang-Sae Moon; Haifeng Jiang,Abstract Existing work on similar sequence matching has focused on either whole matchingor range subsequence matching. In this paper; we present novel methods for rankedsubsequence matching under time warping; which finds top-k subsequences most similar toa query sequence from data sequences. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first andmost sophisticated subsequence matching solution mentioned in the literature. Specifically;we first provide a new notion of the minimum-distance matching-window pair (MDMWP) andformally define the mdmwp-distance; a lower bound between a data subsequence and aquery sequence. The mdmwp-distance can be computed prior to accessing the actualsubsequence. Based on the mdmwp-distance; we then develop a ranked subsequencematching algorithm to prune unnecessary subsequence accesses. Next; to reduce …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,88
iGraph: a framework for comparisons of disk-based graph indexing techniques,Wook-Shin Han; Jinsoo Lee; Minh-Duc Pham; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Graphs are of growing importance in modeling complex structures such aschemical compounds; proteins; images; and program dependence. Given a query graph Q;the subgraph isomorphism problem is to find a set of graphs containing Q from a graphdatabase; which is NP-complete. Recently; there have been a lot of research efforts to solvethe subgraph isomorphism problem for a large graph database by utilizing graph indexes.By using a graph index as a filter; we prune graphs that are not real answers at aninexpensive cost. Then; we need to use expensive subgraph isomorphism tests to verifyfiltered candidates only. This way; the number of disk I/Os and subgraph isomorphism testscan be significantly minimized. The current practice for experiments in graph indexingtechniques is that the author of a newly proposed technique does not implement existing …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,78
Mapping-driven XML transformation,Haifeng Jiang; Howard Ho; Lucian Popa; Wook-Shin Han,Abstract Clio is an existing schema-mapping tool that provides user-friendly means tomanage and facilitate the complex task of transformation and integration of heterogeneousdata such as XML over the Web or in XML databases. By means of mappings from source totarget schemas; Clio can help users conveniently establish the precise semantics of datatransformation and integration. In this paper we study the problem of how to efficientlyimplement such data transformation (ie; generating target data from the source data basedon schema mappings). We present a three-phase framework for high-performance XML-to-XML transformation based on schema mappings; and discuss methodologies andalgorithms for implementing these phases. In particular; we elaborate on novel techniquessuch as streamed extraction of mapped source values and scalable disk-based merging …,Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web,2007,47
Parallelizing query optimization,Wook-Shin Han; Wooseong Kwak; Jinsoo Lee; Guy M Lohman; Volker Markl,Abstract Many commercial RDBMSs employ cost-based query optimization exploitingdynamic programming (DP) to efficiently generate the optimal query execution plan.However; optimization time increases rapidly for queries joining more than 10 tables.Randomized or heuristic search algorithms reduce query optimization time for large joinqueries by considering fewer plans; sacrificing plan optimality. Though commercial systemsexecuting query plans in parallel have existed for over a decade; the optimization of suchplans still occurs serially. While modern microprocessors employ multiple cores toaccelerate computations; parallelizing query optimization to exploit multi-core parallelism isnot as straightforward as it may seem. The DP used in join enumeration belongs to thechallenging nonserial polyadic DP class because of its non-uniform data dependencies …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,46

The G* graph database: efficiently managing large distributed dynamic graphs,Alan G Labouseur; Jeremy Birnbaum; Paul W Olsen; Sean R Spillane; Jayadevan Vijayan; Jeong-Hyon Hwang; Wook-Shin Han,Abstract From sensor networks to transportation infrastructure to social networks; we areawash in data. Many of these real-world networks tend to be large (“big data”) and dynamic;evolving over time. Their evolution can be modeled as a series of graphs. Traditionalsystems that store and analyze one graph at a time cannot effectively handle the complexityand subtlety inherent in dynamic graphs. Modern analytics require systems capable ofstoring and processing series of graphs. We present such a system. G* compresses dynamicgraph data based on commonalities among the graphs in the series for deduplicatedstorage on multiple servers. In addition to the obvious space-saving advantage; large-scalegraph processing tends to be I/O bound; so faster reads from and writes to stable storageenable faster results.

Enabling multi-level relevance feedback on PubMed by integrating rank learning into DBMS,Hwanjo Yu; Taehoon Kim; Jinoh Oh; Ilhwan Ko; Sungchul Kim; Wook-Shin Han,Finding relevant articles from PubMed is challenging because it is hard to express the user'sspecific intention in the given query interface; and a keyword query typically retrieves a largenumber of results. Researchers have applied machine learning techniques to find relevantarticles by ranking the articles according to the learned relevance function. However; theprocess of learning and ranking is usually done offline without integrated with the keywordqueries; and the users have to provide a large amount of training documents to get areasonable learning accuracy. This paper proposes a novel multi-level relevance feedbacksystem for PubMed; called RefMed; which supports both ad-hoc keyword queries and amulti-level relevance feedback in real time on PubMed. RefMed supports a multi-levelrelevance feedback by using the RankSVM as the learning method; and thus it achieves …,BMC bioinformatics,2010,33

A formal framework for prefetching based on the type-level access pattern in object-relational DBMSs,Wook-Shin Han; Kyu-Young Whang; Yang-Sae Moon,Prefetching is an effective method for minimizing the number of fetches between the clientand the server in a database management system. In this paper; we formally define thenotion of prefetching. We also formally propose new notions of the type-level access localityand type-level access pattern. The type-level access locality is a phenomenon that repetitivepatterns exist in the attributes referenced. The type-level access pattern is a pattern ofattributes that are referenced in accessing the objects. We then develop an efficientcapturing and prefetching policy based on this formal framework. Existing prefetchingmethods are based on object-level or page-level access patterns; which consist of object-idsor page-ids of the objects accessed. However; the drawback of these methods is that theywork only when exactly the same objects or pages are accessed repeatedly. In contrast …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2005,30
Progressive optimization in a shared-nothing parallel database,Wook-Shin Han; Jack Ng; Volker Markl; Holger Kache; Mokhtar Kandil,Abstract Commercial enterprise data warehouses are typically implemented on paralleldatabases due to the inherent scalability and performance limitation of a serial architecture.Queries used in such large data warehouses can contain complex predicates as well asmultiple joins; and the resulting query execution plans generated by the optimizer may besub-optimal due to mis-estimates of row cardinalities. Progressive optimization (POP) is anapproach to detect cardinality estimation errors by monitoring actual cardinalities at run-timeand to recover by triggering re-optimization with the actual cardinalities measured. However;the original serial POP solution is based on a serial processing architecture; and the coreideas cannot be readily applied to a parallel shared-nothing environment. Extending theserial POP to a parallel environment is a challenging problem since we need to …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,27
Combining active learning and semi-supervised learning techniques to extract protein interaction sentences,Min Song; Hwanjo Yu; Wook-Shin Han,Protein-protein interaction (PPI) extraction has been a focal point of many biomedicalresearch and database curation tools. Both Active Learning and Semi-supervised SVMshave recently been applied to extract PPI automatically. In this paper; we explore combiningthe AL with the SSL to improve the performance of the PPI task. We propose a novel PPIextraction technique called PPISpotter by combining Deterministic Annealing-based SSLand an AL technique to extract protein-protein interaction. In addition; we extract acomprehensive set of features from MEDLINE records by Natural Language Processing(NLP) techniques; which further improve the SVM classifiers. In our feature selectiontechnique; syntactic; semantic; and lexical properties of text are incorporated into featureselection that boosts the system performance significantly.

A new approach for processing ranked subsequence matching based on ranked union,Wook-Shin Han; Jinsoo Lee; Yang-Sae Moon; Seung-won Hwang; Hwanjo Yu,Abstract Ranked subsequence matching finds top-k subsequences most similar to a givenquery sequence from data sequences. Recently; Han et al.[12] proposed a solution (referredto here as HLMJ) to this problem by using the concept of the minimum distance matchingwindow pair (MDMWP) and a global priority queue. By using the concept of MDMWP; HLMJcan prune many unnecessary accesses to data subsequences using a lower bounddistance. However; we notice that HLMJ may incur serious performance overhead forimportant types of queries. In this paper; we propose a novel systematic framework to solvethis problem by viewing ranked subsequence matching as ranked union. Specifically; wepropose a notion of the matching subsequence equivalence class (MSEQ) and a novellower bound called the MSEQ-distance.

The dynamic predicate: integrating access control with query processing in XML databases,Jae-Gil Lee; Kyu-Young Whang; Wook-Shin Han; Il-Yeol Song,Abstract Recently; access control on XML data has become an important research topic.Previous research on access control mechanisms for XML data has focused on increasingthe efficiency of access control itself; but has not addressed the issue of integrating accesscontrol with query processing. In this paper; we propose an efficient access controlmechanism tightly integrated with query processing for XML databases. We present thenovel concept of the dynamic predicate (DP); which represents a dynamically constructedcondition during query execution. A DP is derived from instance-level authorizations andconstrains accessibility of the elements. The DP allows us to effectively integrateauthorization checking into the query plan so that unauthorized elements are excluded inthe process of query execution. Experimental results show that the proposed access …,The VLDB Journal,2007,25
An XML storage system for object-oriented/object-relational DBMSs,Wook-Shin Han; Ki-Hoon Lee; Byung Suk  Lee,Abstract As XML has become popular as a document standard in the World Wide Web; a lotof research has been done on the XML storage systems for storing and managing XMLdocuments using existing DBMSs. Most of the research activities; however; assume arelational DBMS instead of an object-oriented/object-relational (OO/OR) DBMS; which offersmore powerful modeling capabilities. In this paper; we present the design andimplementation of an XML storage system designed for an OO/OR DBMS. Specifically; wefirst analyze the mapping from an XML document structure to OO/OR database schema.Second; we propose a method for describing the mapping using a standard language calledthe XML Schema Language. Third; we propose system catalog classes for storing themapping information specified by users in the database. Fourth; we propose a detailed …,Journal of Object Technology,2003,25
Taming subgraph isomorphism for RDF query processing,Jinha Kim; Hyungyu Shin; Wook-Shin Han; Sungpack Hong; Hassan Chafi,Abstract RDF data are used to model knowledge in various areas such as life sciences;Semantic Web; bioinformatics; and social graphs. The size of real RDF data reaches billionsof triples. This calls for a framework for efficiently processing RDF data. The core function ofprocessing RDF data is subgraph pattern matching. There have been two completelydifferent directions for supporting efficient subgraph pattern matching. One direction is todevelop specialized RDF query processing engines exploiting the properties of RDF data forthe last decade; while the other direction is to develop efficient subgraph isomorphismalgorithms for general; labeled graphs for over 30 years. Although both directions have asimilar goal (ie; finding subgraphs in data graphs for a given query graph); they have beenindependently researched without clear reason. We argue that a subgraph isomorphism …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,24
StreamTX: extracting tuples from streaming XML data,Wook-Shin Han; Haifeng Jiang; Howard Ho; Quanzhong Li,Abstract We study the problem of extracting flattened tuple data from streaming; hierarchicalXML data. Tuple-extraction queries are essentially XML pattern queries with multipleextraction nodes. Their typical applications include mapping-based XML transformation andintegrated (set-based) processing of XML and relational data. Holistic twig joins are knownfor the optimal matching of XML pattern queries on parsed/indexed XML data. Naïveapplication of the holistic twig joins to streaming XML data incurs unnecessary disk I/Os.

PrefetchGuide: capturing navigational access patterns for prefetching in client/server object-oriented/object-relational DBMSs,Wook-Shin Han; Yang-Sae Moon; Kyu-Young Whang,Abstract In prefetching; the objects that are expected to be accessed in the future are fetchedfrom the server to the client in advance. Prefetching reduces the number of round-trips andincreases the system performance. To prefetch object effectively; we need to correctlypredict the future navigational patterns. In this paper; we propose the PrefetchGuide; a noveldata structure that captures the navigational access patterns. We also formally define thenotion of the attribute access log set and analyze the navigational access patterns that canbe captured by the PrefetchGuide. We then present an prefetching algorithm using thePrefetchGuide. To show effectiveness of our algorithm; we have conducted extensiveexperiments in a prototype object-relational database management systems (DBMS).

OPT: a new framework for overlapped and parallel triangulation in large-scale graphs,Jinha Kim; Wook-Shin Han; Sangyeon Lee; Kyungyeol Park; Hwanjo Yu,Abstract Graph triangulation; which finds all triangles in a graph; has been actively studieddue to its wide range of applications in the network analysis and data mining. With the rapidgrowth of graph data size; disk-based triangulation methods are in demand but littleresearched. To handle a large-scale graph which does not fit in memory; we must iterativelyload small parts of the graph. In the existing literature; achieving the ideal cost has beenconsidered to be impossible for billion-scale graphs due to the memory size constraint. Inthis paper; we propose an overlapped and parallel disk-based triangulation framework forbillion-scale graphs; OPT; which achieves the ideal cost by (1) full overlap of the CPU andI/O operations and (2) full parallelism of multi-core CPU and FlashSSD I/O. In OPT; trianglesin memory are called the internal triangles while triangles constituting vertices in memory …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,23
Dependency-aware reordering for parallelizing query optimization in multi-core CPUs,Wook-Shin Han; Jinsoo Lee,Abstract The state of the art commercial query optimizers employ cost-based optimizationand exploit dynamic programming (DP) to find the optimal query execution plan (QEP)without evaluating redundant sub-plans. The number of alternative QEPs enumerated by theDP query optimizer can increase exponentially; as the number of joins in the queryincreases. Recently; by exploiting the coming wave of multi-core processor architectures; astate of the art parallel optimization algorithm [14]; referred to as PDP sva; has beenproposed to parallelize the" time-consuming" DP query optimization process itself. WhilePDP sva significantly extends the practical use of DP to queries having up to 20-25 tables; ithas several limitations: 1) supporting only the size-driven DP enumerator; 2) staticallyallocating search space; and 3) not fully exploiting parallelism. In this paper; we propose …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,21
Processing SPARQL queries with regular expressions in RDF databases,Jinsoo Lee; Minh-Duc Pham; Jihwan Lee; Wook-Shin Han; Hune Cho; Hwanjo Yu; Jeong-Hoon Lee,As the Resource Description Framework (RDF) data model is widely used for modeling andsharing a lot of online bioinformatics resources such as Uniprot (dev. isb-sib.ch/projects/uniprot-rdf) or Bio2RDF (bio2rdf. org); SPARQL-a W3C recommendation queryfor RDF databases-has become an important query language for querying the bioinformaticsknowledge bases. Moreover; due to the diversity of users' requests for extracting informationfrom the RDF data as well as the lack of users' knowledge about the exact value of each factin the RDF databases; it is desirable to use the SPARQL query with regular expressionpatterns for querying the RDF data. To the best of our knowledge; there is currently no workthat efficiently supports regular expression processing in SPARQL over RDF databases.Most of the existing techniques for processing regular expressions are designed for …,BMC bioinformatics,2011,19
Dynamic buffer allocation in video-on-demand systems,Sang-Ho Lee; Kyu-Young Whang; Yang-Sae Moon; Wook-Shin Han; Il-Yeol Song,In video-on-demand (VOD) systems; as the size of the buffer allocated to user requestsincreases; initial latency and memory requirements increase. Hence; the buffer size must beminimized. The existing static buffer allocation scheme; however; determines the buffer sizebased on the assumption that the system is in the fully loaded state. Thus; when the systemis in a partially loaded state; the scheme allocates a buffer larger than necessary to a userrequest. This paper proposes a dynamic buffer allocation scheme that allocates to userrequests buffers of the minimum size in a partially loaded state; as well as in the fully loadedstate. The inherent difficulty in determining the buffer size in the dynamic buffer allocationscheme is that the size of the buffer currently being allocated is dependent on the number ofand the sizes of the buffers to be allocated in the next service period. We solve this …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2003,19
POP/FED: progressive query optimization for federated queries in DB2,Holger Kache; Wook-Shin Han; Volker Markl; Vijayshankar Raman; Stephan Ewen,Abstract Federated queries are regular relational queries accessing data on one or moreremote relational or non-relational data sources; possibly combining them with tables storedin the federated DBMS server. Their execution is typically divided between the federatedserver and the remote data sources. Outdated and incomplete statistics have a biggerimpact on federated DBMS than on regular DBMS; as maintenance of federated statistics isunequally more complicated and expensive than the maintenance of the local statistics;consequently bad performance commonly occurs for federated queries due to the selectionof a suboptimal query plan. To solve this problem we propose a progressive optimizationtechnique for federated queries called POP/FED by extending the state of the art forprogressive reoptimization for local source queries; POP [4].

Transform-space view: performing spatial join in the transform space using original-space indexes,Min-Jae Lee; Kyu-Young Whang; Wook-Shin Han; I-Y Song,Spatial joins find all pairs of objects that satisfy a given spatial relationship. In spatial joinsusing indexes; original-space indexes such as the R-tree are widely used. An original-spaceindex is the one that indexes objects as represented in the original space. Since original-space indexes deal with extents of objects; it is relatively complex to optimize join algorithmsusing these indexes. On the other hand; transform-space indexes; which transform objects inthe original space into points in the transform space and index them; deal only with pointsbut no extents. Thus; optimization of join algorithms using these indexes can be relativelysimple. However; the disadvantage of these join algorithms is that they cannot be applied tooriginal-space indexes such as the R-tree. In this paper; we present a novel mechanism forachieving the best of these two types of algorithms. Specifically; we propose the new …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2006,17
The clustering property of corner transformation for spatial database applications,Ju-Won Song; Kyu-Young Whang; Young-Koo Lee; Min-Jae Lee; Wook-Shin Han; Byung-Kwon Park,Abstract Spatial access methods (SAMs) are often used as clustering indexes in spatialdatabase systems. Therefore; a SAM should have the clustering property both in the indexand in the data file. In this paper; we argue that corner transformation preserves theclustering property such that objects having similar sizes and positions in the original spacetend to be placed in the same region in the transform space. We then show that SAMs basedon corner transformation are able to maintain clustering both in the index and in the data filefor storage systems with fixed object positions and propose the MBR-MLGF as an exampleto implement such an index. In the storage systems with fixed object positions; the insertedobjects never move during the operation of the system. Most storage systems currentlyavailable adopt this architecture.

Structural consistency: enabling XML keyword search to eliminate spurious results consistently,Ki-Hoon Lee; Kyu-Young Whang; Wook-Shin Han; Min-Soo Kim,Abstract XML keyword search is a user-friendly way to query XML data using only keywords.In XML keyword search; to achieve high precision without sacrificing recall; it is important toremove spurious results not intended by the user. Efforts to eliminate spurious results haveenjoyed some success using the concepts of LCA or its variants; SLCA and MLCA.However; existing methods still could find many spurious results. The fundamental cause forthe occurrence of spurious results is that the existing methods try to eliminate spuriousresults locally without global examination of all the query results and; accordingly; somespurious results are not consistently eliminated. In this paper; we propose a novel keywordsearch method that removes spurious results consistently by exploiting the new concept ofstructural consistency. We define structural consistency as a property that is preserved if …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2010,15
Prefetching based on the type-level access pattern in object-relational DBMSs,Wook-Shin Han; Kyu-Young Whang; Yang-Sae Moon; Il-Yeol Song,Prefetching is an effective method for minimizing the number of round-trips between theclient and the server in database management systems. We propose new notions of the type-level access locality and the type-level access pattern. We also formally define the notions ofcapturing and prefetching to help understand the underlying mechanisms. We then developan efficient prefetching policy based on these notions and the framework. The type-levelaccess locality is a phenomenon that repetitive patterns exist in the attributes referenced.The type-level access pattern is a pattern of attributes that are referenced in accessing theobjects. Existing prefetching methods are based on object-level or page-level accesspatterns; which consist of object-ids or page-ids of the objects accessed.

Efficient feature weighting methods for ranking,Hwanjo Yu; Jinoh Oh; Wook-Shin Han,Abstract Feature weighting or selection is a crucial process to identify an important subset offeatures from a data set. Removing irrelevant or redundant features can improve thegeneralization performance of ranking functions in information retrieval. Due to fundamentaldifferences between classification and ranking; feature weighting methods developed forclassification cannot be readily applied to feature weighting for ranking. A state of the artfeature selection method for ranking; called GAS; has been recently proposed; whichexploits importance of each feature and similarity between every pair of features. However;GAS must compute the similarity scores of all pairs of features; thus it is not scalable for high-dimensional data and its performance degrades on nonlinear ranking functions.

Fast and robust parallel SGD matrix factorization,Jinoh Oh; Wook-Shin Han; Hwanjo Yu; Xiaoqian Jiang,Abstract Matrix factorization is one of the fundamental techniques for analyzing latentrelationship between two entities. Especially; it is used for recommendation for its highaccuracy. Efficient parallel SGD matrix factorization algorithms have been developed forlarge matrices to speed up the convergence of factorization. However; most of them aredesigned for a shared-memory environment thus fail to factorize a large matrix that is too bigto fit in memory; and their performances are also unreliable when the matrix is skewed. Thispaper proposes a fast and robust parallel SGD matrix factorization algorithm; called MLGF-MF; which is robust to skewed matrices and runs efficiently on block-storage devices (eg;SSD disks) as well as shared-memory. MLGF-MF uses Multi-Level Grid File (MLGF) forpartitioning the matrix and minimizes the cost for scheduling parallel SGD updates on the …,Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2015,13

The method may performschema mapping-based XML transformation as a three-phase process comprising tupleextraction; XML-fragment generation; and data merging. The tuple extraction phase may beadapted to handle streamed XML data (as well as stored/indexed XML data). The datamerging phase may use a hybrid method that can dynamically switch between main memory-based and disk-based algorithms based on the size of the XML data to be merged.,*,2008,13
Efficient evaluation of partial match queries for XML documents using information retrieval techniques,Young-Ho Park; Kyu-Young Whang; Byung Suk Lee; Wook-Shin Han,Abstract We propose XIR; a novel method for processing partial match queries onheterogeneous XML documents using information retrieval (IR) techniques. A partial matchquery is defined as the one having the descendent-or-self axis “//” in its path expression. Inits general form; a partial match query has branch predicates forming branching paths. Theobjective of XIR is to efficiently support this type of queries for large-scale documents ofheterogeneous schemas. XIR has its basis on the conventional schema-level methods usingrelational tables and significantly improves their efficiency using two techniques: an invertedindex technique and a novel prefix match join. The former indexes the labels in label pathsas keywords in texts; and allows for finding the label paths matching the queries moreefficiently than string match used in the conventional methods.

The method may performschema mapping-based XML transformation as a three-phase process comprising tupleextraction; XML-fragment generation; and data merging. The tuple extraction phase may beadapted to handle streamed XML data (as well as stored/indexed XML data). The datamerging phase may use a hybrid method that can dynamically switch between main memory-based and disk-based algorithms based on the size of the XML data to be merged.,*,2014,11
Leveraging spatial join for robust tuple extraction from web pages,Wook-Shin Han; Wooseong Kwak; Hwanjo Yu; Jeong-Hoon Lee; Min-Soo Kim,Abstract Extracting tuples from HTML pages has been an important issue in various webapplications. Commercial tuple extraction systems have enjoyed some success to extracttuples by regarding HTML pages as tree structures and exploiting XPath queries to findattributes of tuples in the HTML pages. However; such systems would be vulnerable to smallchanges on the web pages. In this paper; we propose a robust tuple extraction system whichutilizes spatial relationships among elements rather than the XPath queries. Spatialinformation (eg; 2-D coordinates) of elements are maintained in the DOM tree when a webpage is rendered in a browser. Our system regards elements in the rendered page as spatialobjects in the 2-D space and executes spatial joins to extract target elements. Since humansalso identify an element in a web page by its relative spatial location; our system …,Information Sciences,2014,11
iGraph in action: performance analysis of disk-based graph indexing techniques,Wook-Shin Han; Minh-Duc Pham; Jinsoo Lee; Romans Kasperovics; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Graphs provide a powerful way to model complex structures such as chemicalcompounds; proteins; images; and program dependence. The previous practice forexperiments in graph indexing techniques is that the author of a newly proposed techniquedoes not implement existing indexes on his own code base; but instead uses the originalauthors' binary executables and reports only the wall clock time. However; we observed thatthis practice may result in several problems [6]. In order to address these problems; we haveimplemented all representative graph indexing techniques on a common framework callediGraph [6]. In this demonstration we showcase iGraph and its visual tools using several realdatasets and their workloads. For selected queries of the workloads; we show severalunique features including visual performance analysis.,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,10
Tightly-coupled spatial database features in the Odysseus/OpenGIS DBMS for high-performance,Kyu-Young Whang; Jae-Gil Lee; Min-Soo Kim; Min-Jae Lee; Ki-Hoon Lee; Wook-Shin Han; Jun-Sung Kim,Abstract Conventional object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) vendorsprovide extension mechanisms for adding user-defined types and functions to their ownDBMSs. Here; the extension mechanisms are implemented using a high-level (typically;SQL-level) interface. We call this mechanism loose-coupling. The advantage of loose-coupling is that it is easy to implement. However; it is not preferable for implementing newdata types and operations in large databases when high performance is required. We haveearlier proposed the tight-coupling architecture (Whang et al. 2002; 2005) to satisfy thisrequirement. In tight-coupling; new data types and operations are integrated into the core ofthe DBMS engine in the extensible type layer. Thus; they are supported in a consistentmanner with high performance. This tight-coupling architecture is being used to …,GeoInformatica,2010,10
Processing time-dependent shortest path queries without pre-computed speed information on road networks,Jinha Kim; Wook-Shin Han; Jinoh Oh; Sungchul Kim; Hwanjo Yu,Abstract Shortest path (or least travel time path) identification has been actively studied fordirect application to road networks. In addition; the processing of time-dependent shortest-path queries; which use past traffic data to compute the speed variations of road segments;has been investigated in order to incorporate speed variations over time. However; speedinformation pre-computed from static past traffic data is often invalid because road traffic isinherently dynamic. This paper addresses a new problem in processing a Dynamic Time-Dependent Shortest Path (DTDSP) query; which considers the current road status withoutassuming pre-determined speed patterns on roads. By dynamically adjusting the speedpatterns of roads instead of fixing them based on past traffic data; the recommended paths;which reflect the current road status; are more effective in distributing the road traffic and …,Information sciences,2014,9
Exact indexing for support vector machines,Hwanjo Yu; Ilhwan Ko; Youngdae Kim; Seungwon Hwang; Wook-Shin Han,Abstract SVM (Support Vector Machine) is a well-established machine learningmethodology popularly used for classification; regression; and ranking. Recently SVM hasbeen actively researched for rank learning and applied to various applications includingsearch engines or relevance feedback systems. A query in such systems is the rankingfunction F learned by SVM. Once learning a function F or formulating the query; processingthe query to find top-k results requires evaluating the entire database by F. So far; thereexists no exact indexing solution for SVM functions. Existing top-k query processingalgorithms are not applicable to the machine-learned ranking functions; as they often makerestrictive assumptions on the query; such as linearity or monotonicity of functions. Existingmetric-based or reference-based indexing methods are also not applicable; because data …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,9
Hippocratic XML databases: a model and an access control mechanism,Jae-Gil Lee; Kyu-Young Whang; W Han; I Song,Abstract The Hippocratic database model recently proposed by Agrawal et al. incorporatesprivacy protection capabilities into relational databases. Since the Hippocratic database isbased on the relational database; it needs extensions to be adapted for XML databases. Inthis paper; we propose the Hippocratic XML database model; an extension of theHippocratic database model for XML databases and present an efficient access controlmechanism under this model. In contrast to relational data; XML data have tree-likehierarchies. Thus; in order to manage these hierarchies of XML data; we extend and formallydefine concepts presented in the Hippocratic database model. Next; we present a newmechanism; which we call the authorization index; that is used in the access controlmechanism. This authorization index; which is implemented using a multi-dimensional …,COMPUTER SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,2006,9
Efficient evaluation of linear path expressions on large-scale heterogeneous XML documents using information retrieval techniques,Young-Ho Park; Kyu-Young Whang; Byung Suk Lee; Wook-Shin Han,Abstract We propose XIR-Linear; a method for efficiently evaluating linear path expressions(LPEs) on large-scale heterogeneous XML documents using information retrieval (IR)techniques. LPEs are the primary form of XPath queries; and their evaluation techniqueshave been researched actively. XPath queries in their general form are partial matchqueries; and these queries are particularly useful for searching documents ofheterogeneous schemas. Thus; XIR-Linear is geared for partial match queries expressed asLPEs. XIR-Linear has its basis on existing methods using relational tables (eg; XRel;XParent); and drastically improves their efficiency using the inverted index technique.Specifically; it indexes the labels in label paths (ie; sequences of node labels) like keywordsin texts; and finds the label paths matching the LPE far more efficiently than string match …,Journal of Systems and Software,2006,9
XMin: Minimizing tree pattern queries with minimality guarantee,Ki-Hoon Lee; Kyu-Young Whang; Wook-Shin Han,Abstract Due to wide use of XPath; the problem of efficiently processing XPath queries hasrecently received a lot of attention. In particular; a considerable effort has been devoted tominimizing XPath queries since the efficiency of query processing greatly depends on thesize of the query. Research work in this area can be classified into two categories: constraint-independent minimization and constraint-dependent minimization. The former minimizesqueries in the absence of integrity constraints while the latter in the presence of them. For alinear path query; which is an XPath query without branching predicates; existing constraint-independent minimization methods are generally known to be unable to minimize the querywithout processing the query itself. Most recently; however; by using the DataGuide; arepresentative structural summary of XML data; a constraint-independent method that …,World Wide Web,2010,8
Hybrid garbage collection for multi-version concurrency control in SAP HANA,Juchang Lee; Hyungyu Shin; Chang Gyoo Park; Seongyun Ko; Jaeyun Noh; Yongjae Chuh; Wolfgang Stephan; Wook-Shin Han,Abstract While multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) supports fast and robustperformance in in-memory; relational databases; it has the potential problem of a growingnumber of versions over time due to obsolete versions. Although a few TB of main memory isavailable for enterprise machines; the memory resource should be used carefully foreconomic and practical reasons. Thus; in order to maintain the necessary number ofversions in MVCC; versions which will no longer be used need to be deleted. This process iscalled garbage collection. MVCC uses the concept of visibility to define garbage. A set ofversions for each record is first identified as candidate if their version timestamps are lowerthan the minimum value of snapshot timestamps of active snapshots in the system. All suchcandidates; except the one which has the maximum version timestamp; are safely …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,7
Type-level access pattern view: Enhancing prefetching performance using the iterative and recursive patterns,Wook-Shin Han; Woong-Kee Loh; Kyu-Young Whang,Abstract Since recent applications such as XML applications; Geographical InformationSystems (GIS); and CAD/CAM systems require highly efficient data management; they arebuilt on Object-Relational DBMS (ORDBMS). The applications are called navigationalapplications; and they navigate the composite objects connected via the reference and thecollection attributes in the ORDBMS. When a navigational application accesses an object; itfirst checks whether the object is stored in the object cache. If not; the object must be fetchedfrom the database in the server; which is a costly operation. Prefetching identifies the objectsthat are most likely to be accessed in the near future by the navigational applications andstores them in the object cache in advance. Since prefetching reduces the number of objectfetches; it is crucial for improving the application performance. However; the experimental …,Information Sciences,2010,7
Developing a hybrid dictionary-based bio-entity recognition technique,Min Song; Hwanjo Yu; Wook-Shin Han,Bio-entity extraction is a pivotal component for information extraction from biomedicalliterature. The dictionary-based bio-entity extraction is the first generation of Named EntityRecognition (NER) techniques. This paper presents a hybrid dictionary-based bio-entityextraction technique. The approach expands the bio-entity dictionary by combining differentdata sources and improves the recall rate through the shortest path edit distance algorithm.In addition; the proposed technique adopts text mining techniques in the merging stage ofsimilar entities such as Part of Speech (POS) expansion; stemming; and the exploitation ofthe contextual cues to further improve the performance. The experimental results show thatthe proposed technique achieves the best or at least equivalent performance amongcompared techniques; GENIA; MESH; UMLS; and combinations of these three resources …,BMC medical informatics and decision making,2015,6
Adaptive row major order: a new space filling curve for efficient spatial join processing in the transform space,Min-Jae Lee; Kyu-Young Whang; Wook-Shin Han; Il-Yeol Song,Abstract A transform-space index indexes spatial objects represented as points in thetransform space. An advantage of a transform-space index is that optimization of spatial joinalgorithms using these indexes can be more formal. The authors earlier proposed theTransform-Based Spatial Join algorithm that joins two transform-space indexes. It rendersglobal optimization easy with little overhead by utilizing the characteristics of the transformspace. In particular; it allows us to globally determine the order of accessing disk pages;which makes a significant impact on the performance of joins. For this purpose; we usevarious space filling curves. In this paper; we propose a new space filling curve called theadaptive row major order (ARM order). The ARM order adaptively controls the order ofaccessing pages and significantly reduces the one-pass buffer size (the minimum buffer …,Journal of Systems and Software,2005,6
DB-IR integration using tight-coupling in the Odysseus DBMS,Kyu-Young Whang; Jae-Gil Lee; Min-Jae Lee; Wook-Shin Han; Min-Soo Kim; Jun-Sung Kim,Abstract As many recent applications require integration of structured data and text data;unifying database (DB) and information retrieval (IR) technologies has become one of majorchallenges in our field. There have been active discussions on the system architecture forDB-IR integration; but a clear agreement has not been reached yet. Along this direction; wehave advocated the use of the tight-coupling architecture and developed a novel structure ofthe IR index as well as tightly-coupled query processing algorithms. In tight-coupling; the textdata type is supported from the storage system just like a built-in data type so that the queryprocessor can efficiently handle queries involving both structured data and text data. In thispaper; for archival purposes; we consolidate our achievements reported at non-regularpublications over the last ten years or so; extending them by adding greater details on the …,World Wide Web,2015,5
Cost-based predictive spatiotemporal join,Wook-Shin Han; Jaehwa Kim; Byung Suk Lee; Yufei Tao; Ralf Rantzau; Volker Markl,A predictive spatiotemporal join finds all pairs of moving objects satisfying a join conditionon future time and space. In this paper; we present CoPST; the first and foremost algorithmfor such a join using two spatiotemporal indexes. In a predictive spatiotemporal join; thebounding boxes of the outer index are used to perform window searches on the inner index;and these bounding boxes enclose objects with increasing laxity over time. CoPSTconstructs globally tightened bounding boxes" on the fly" to perform window searches duringjoin processing; thus significantly minimizing overlap and improving the join performance.CoPST adapts gracefully to large-scale databases; by dynamically switching between main-memory buffering and disk-based buffering; through a novel probabilistic cost model. Ourextensive experiments validate the cost model and show its accuracy for realistic data …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2009,5
DUALSIM: Parallel subgraph enumeration in a massive graph on a single machine,Hyeonji Kim; Juneyoung Lee; Sourav S Bhowmick; Wook-Shin Han; JeongHoon Lee; Seongyun Ko; Moath HA Jarrah,Abstract Subgraph enumeration is important for many applications such as subgraphfrequencies; network motif discovery; graphlet kernel computation; and studying theevolution of social networks. Most earlier work on subgraph enumeration assumes thatgraphs are resident in memory; which results in serious scalability problems. Recently;efforts to enumerate all subgraphs in a large-scale graph have seemed to enjoy somesuccess by partitioning the data graph and exploiting the distributed frameworks such asMapReduce and distributed graph engines. However; we notice that all existing distributedapproaches have serious performance problems for subgraph enumeration due to theexplosive number of partial results. In this paper; we design and implement a disk-based;single machine parallel subgraph enumeration solution called DualSim that can handle …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,4
iKernel: Exact indexing for support vector machines,Youngdae Kim; Ilhwan Ko; Wook-Shin Han; Hwanjo Yu,Abstract SVM (Support Vector Machine) is a well-established machine learningmethodology popularly used for learning classification; regression; and ranking functions.Especially; SVM for rank learning has been applied to various applications including searchengines or relevance feedback systems. A ranking function F learned by SVM becomes thequery in some search engines: A relevance function F is learned from the user's feedbackwhich expresses the user's search intention; and top-k results are found by evaluating theentire database by F. This paper proposes an exact indexing solution for the SVM functionqueries; which is to find top-k results without evaluating the entire database. Indexing forSVM faces new challenges; that is; an index must be built on the kernel space (SVM featurespace) where (1) data points are invisible and (2) the distance function changes with …,Information Sciences,2014,4

Influence maximization based on reachability sketches in dynamic graphs,Dongeun Kim; Dongmin Hyeon; Jinoh Oh; Wook-Shin Han; Hwanjo Yu,Abstract Influence maximization is the problem of selecting the most influential nodes in agiven graph. The problem is applicable to viral marketing and is actively researched associal networks become the media of information propagation. To solve the challenges ofinfluence maximization; previous works approximate the influence evaluations to reduce therunning time and to simultaneously guarantee the quality of those evaluations. We proposea new influence maximization algorithm that overcomes the limitations of the state of the artalgorithms. We also devise our algorithm to process update operations of dynamic graphs.Our algorithm outperforms the state of the art algorithms TIM+ and SKIM in running time; andits influence spread is also comparable to the others.

A Visualization Tool For Ranked Subsequence Matching in Time-Series Databases,Sung-Jin Lee; Jin-Soo Lee; Hune Cho; Wook-Shin Han,Abstract Time-series data are sequences of real numbers; sampling a sequential data intothe fixed time intervals. Common examples of time-series data are the music data; videodata; electroncardiogram data; and the data of stock graphs. A time-series data can beclassified into the data sequence stored in a database and the query sequence received byusers. For querying a time-series database; a ranked subsequence matching program isused to find top-k subsequences which are the most similar to the query sequence from thedata sequence. The goal of this paper is to develop a visualization tool which can improveand facilitate the usage of the ranked subsequence matching program of the existingconsole based systems; in spite of the insufficient user's recognition and understandingabout the matching method.

On supporting effective web extraction,Wook-Shin Han; Wooseong Kwak; Hwanjo Yu,Commercial tuple extraction systems have enjoyed some success to extract tuples byregarding HTML pages as tree structures and exploiting XPath queries to find attributes oftuples in the HTML pages. However; such systems would be vulnerable to small changes onthe web pages. In this paper; we propose a robust tuple extraction system which utilizesspatial relationships among elements rather than the XPath queries of the elements. Oursystem regards elements in the rendered page as spatial objects in the 2-D space andexecutes spatial joins to extract target elements. Since humans also identify an element in aweb page by its relative spatial location; our system extracting elements by their spatialrelationships could possibly be as robust as manual extraction and is far more robust thanexisting tuple extraction systems.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,3
2D-CHI: a tunable two-dimensional class hierarchy index for object-oriented databases,Jong-Hak Lee; Kyu-Young Whang; Wook-Shin Han; Wan-Sup Cho; Il-Yeol Song,We present a tunable two-dimensional class hierarchy indexing technique (2D-CHI) forobject-oriented databases. We use a two-dimensional file organization as the indexstructure. 2D-CHI deals with the problem of clustering objects in a two-dimensional domainspace consisting of the key attribute domain and the class identifier domain. In conventionalclass indexing techniques using one-dimensional index structures such as the B/sup+/-tree;the clustering property is exclusively owned by one attribute. These indexing techniques donot efficiently handle the queries that address both the attribute keys and the classidentifiers. 2D-CHI enhances query performance by adjusting the degree of clusteringbetween the key value domain and the class identifier domain based on the precollectedusage pattern.

BoDBES: a boosted dictionary-based biomedical entity spotter,Min Song; Wook-Shin Han; Hwanjo Yu,To measure the impact of the difference sources on the performance of entity extraction; weused three different data sources: 1) GENIA; 2) Mesh Tree; and 3) UMLS. The performanceis also measured by F1. In the performance comparision among three approaches on thedictionary with GENIA+ MeSH; BoDBES is slightly better than SPED in all three datasetswhereas the context only option shows the worst performance. The most significant novelfeature of our method is that it is based on the two-level string matching technique that SPEDis applied to candidate sets of matched entries from a dictionary. The experimental resultsshow that the proposed technique outperforms the approaches with text mining techniquesonly as well as with SPED only by F measure in most cases.,Proceedings of the 7th international workshop on Data and text mining in biomedical informatics,2013,2
Extracting biomedical concepts from fulltext by relative importance in a graph model,Min Song; Said Bleik; Hwanjo Yu; Wook-Shin Han,Extracting concepts from fulltext data collections is a daunting task in that many differentconcepts and themes are intertwined and ample term variation exists in fulltext. Conceptsrepresent topics or themes of a article and are helpful means of managing and searchinglarge document collections. In addition; automatically extracting and assigning conceptsplay a pivotal role in indexing electronic documents and building digital libraries. In thispaper we propose a novel approach to biomedical concept extraction by adopting a rankingalgorithm of relative importance in concept graphs. The proposed consists of two majorsteps: First; we represent full-text documents by graphs whose nodes and edges aredetermined by named entity recognition and UMLS Semantic Network.

CC-GiST: cache conscious-generalized search tree for supporting various fast intelligent applications,Won-Sik Kim; Woong-Kee Loh; Wook-Shin Han,Abstract According to the advance of technologies; the speed gap between CPU and mainmemory is getting larger every year. Due to the speed gap; it was perceived important tomake the most use of the cache residing between CPU and main memory; and there havebeen a lot of research efforts on this issue. Among those is the research on cache conscioustrees for reducing the cost for accessing main memory indexes. Cache conscious trees weredesigned to cause as few cache misses as possible based on the characteristics of thecache. The most widely known cache conscious trees are the CSB+-tree; the pkB-tree; andthe CR-tree. Since it is costly and error-prone to implement every cache conscious treeseparately; we need a new systematic approach. An analogous approach was made for thedisk based indexes.

Type-level access pattern view: a technique for enhancing prefetching performance,Wook-Shin Han; Woong-Kee Loh; Kyu-Young Whang,Abstract Navigational applications on Object-Relational DBMSs (ORDBMSs) access objectsin the database related to one another via reference and collection attributes. Whenaccessing an object; the applications first look up the object cache in the client and; if theobject does not exist; fetch the object from the server. Prefetching is to identify the objectsthat are highly probable to be accessed in the future by the applications and to save theseobjects in the object cache in advance. Since prefetching reduces the number of high costfetches; it is crucial for the performance of the applications. The prefetch method proposedby Han et al.[7] reduces the number of fetches by orders of magnitude compared with theprevious methods. However; overall performance enhancement is not as significant asreduction of fetches. Since the performance of prefetching is determined by the number of …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2006,2

DSP-CC-: I/O efficient parallel computation of connected components in billion-scale networks,Min-Soo Kim; Sangyeon Lee; Wook-Shin Han; Himchan Park; Jeong-Hoon Lee,Computing connected components is a core operation on graph data. Since billion-scalegraphs cannot be resident in memory of a single server; several approaches based ondistributed machines have recently been proposed. The representative methods are Hash-To-Min and PowerGraph. Hash-To-Min is the state-of-the art disk-based distributed methodwhich minimizes the number of MapReduce rounds. PowerGraph is the-state-of-the-art in-memory distributed system; which is typically faster than the diskbased distributed one;however; requires a lot of machines for handling billion-scale graphs.

A scalable pipeline data processing framework using database and visualization techniques,Wook-Shin Han; Soon Ki Jung; Jeyong Shin; Jinsoo Lee; Mina Yoon; Chang Geol Yoon; Won Seok Seo; Sang Ok Koo,Abstract Intelligent pipeline inspection gauges (PIGs) are inspection vehicles that movealong within a gas (or oil) pipeline and acquire signals from their surrounding rings ofsensors. By analyzing the signals captured by intelligent PIGs; we can detect pipelinedefects; such as holes; curvatures and other potential causes of gas explosions. We noticethat the size of collected data using a PIG is usually in GB range.

Estimating nested selectivity in object-oriented databases,Wan-Sup Cho; Wook-Shin Han; Ki-Hyung Hong; Kyu-Young Whang,Abstract A searchcondition in object-oriented queries consists of nested predicates; each ofwhich is a predicate on a path expression. In this paper; w epresent a new selectivityestimation technique for nested predicates. Selectivity of a nested predicate; neste dselectivity; is defined as the ratio of the number of qualified objects of the starting class in thepath expression to the total number of objects of the class. The new technique takes intoaccount the effects of direct representation of manyto-many relationships. Many-to-manyrelationships frequently occur in object-oriented databases; but have not been properlyhandled in con ven tionalselectivit yestimation techniques. F or many-to-many relationships;we generalize the block-hit function originally proposed by B. Yao allowing the cases whereone object belongs to more than one block.

Scalable and parallelizable influence maximization with Random Walk Ranking and Rank Merge Pruning,Seungkeol Kim; Dongeun Kim; Jinoh Oh; Jeong-Hyon Hwang; Wook-Shin Han; Wei Chen; Hwanjo Yu,Abstract As social networking services become a large part of modern life; interest inapplications using social networks has rapidly increased. One interesting application is viralmarketing; which can be formulated in graph theory as the influence maximization problem.Specifically; the goal of the influence maximization problem is to find a set of k nodes(corresponding to individuals in social network) whose influence spread is maximum.Several methods have been proposed to tackle this problem but to select the k mostinfluential nodes; they suffer from the high computational cost of approximating the influencespread of every individual node. In this paper; we propose an effective pruning method forthe influence maximization problem based on Random Walk and Rank Merge. The key ideais to efficiently find and prune out uninfluential nodes in order to dramatically reduce the …,Information Sciences,2017,*
PAMAE: Parallel k-Medoids Clustering with High Accuracy and Efficiency,Hwanjun Song; Jae-Gil Lee; Wook-Shin Han,Abstract The k-medoids algorithm is one of the best-known clustering algorithms. Despitethis; however; it is not as widely used for big data analytics as the k-means algorithm; mainlybecause of its high computational complexity. Many studies have attempted to solve theefficiency problem of the k-medoids algorithm; but all such studies have improved efficiencyat the expense of accuracy. In this paper; we propose a novel parallel k-medoids algorithm;which we call PAMAE; that achieves both high accuracy and high efficiency. We identify twofactors---" global search" and" entire data"---that are essential to achieving high accuracy;but are also very time-consuming if considered simultaneously. Thus; our key idea is toapply them individually through two phases: parallel seeding and parallel refinement;neither of which is costly. The first phase performs global search over sampled data; and …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2017,*
Parallel replication across formats in SAP HANA for scaling out mixed OLTP/OLAP workloads,Juchang Lee; SeungHyun Moon; Kyu Hwan Kim; Deok Hoe Kim; Sang Kyun Cha; Wook-Shin Han,Abstract Modern in-memory database systems are facing the need of efficiently supportingmixed workloads of OLTP and OLAP. A conventional approach to this requirement is to relyon ETL-style; application-driven data replication between two very different OLTP and OLAPsystems; sacrificing real-time reporting on operational data. An alternative approach is to runOLTP and OLAP workloads in a single machine; which eventually limits the maximumscalability of OLAP query performance. In order to tackle this challenging problem; wepropose a novel database replication architecture called Asynchronous Parallel TableReplication (ATR). ATR supports OLTP workloads in one primary machine; while it supportsheavy OLAP workloads in replicas. Here; row-store formats can be used for OLTPtransactions at the primary; while column-store formats are used for OLAP analytical …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,*
Partitioned-Tree Nested Loop Join: An Efficient Join for Spatio-Temporal Interval Join,Jinsoo Lee; Wook-Shin Han; Jaewha Kim; Jeong-Hoon Lee,A predictive spatio-temporal interval join finds all pairs of moving objects satisfying a joincondition on future time interval and space. In this paper; we propose a method calledPTJoin. PTJoin partitions the inner index into small sub-trees and performs the join processfor each sub-tree to reduce the number of disk page accesses for each window search.Furthermore; to reduce the number of pages accessed by consecutive window searches; wepartition the index so that overlapping index pages do not belong to the same partition. Ourexperiments show that PTJoin reduces the number of page accesses by up to an order ofmagnitude compared to Interval_STJoin [9]; which is the state-of-the-art solution; when thebuffer size is small.,IEICE TRANSACTIONS on Information and Systems,2013,*

Entity-Relationship Reformulation of SPARQL Query Results on RDF Data,Jeong-Hoon Lee; Sang-Yeon Lee; Wook-Shin Han,Abstract Ontology is a formal representation of concepts within a specific domain and theirrelationships. Ontology becomes prevalently used in many areas such as informationscience; e-commerce; and medical field. In order to enhance the utilization of ontology data;we need a method for effectively visualizing the result of a SPARQL query; which is a well-known query language for searching ontology data. However; existing methods forvisualization cannot effectively visualize the query result's context (ie; conceptualcomponents such as entities and their relationships) needed to explain the query result inthe conceptual level. The context sometimes is important for a user to understand themeaning of the result. In order to solve the problem of the existing methods; we propose avisualization method based on entity-relationship model; which maps the query result to …,Journal of KIISE: Databases,2011,*
Dynamic concept ontology construction for pubmed queries,Jinoh Oh; Taehoon Kim; Sun Park; Wook-Shin Han; Hwanjo Yu,Abstract Exploring PubMed to find relevant information is challenging and time-consuming;as PubMed typically returns a large list of articles as a result of query. Existing works inimproving the search quality on PubMed have focused on helping PubMed queryformulation; clustering the results; or ranking by relevance. This paper proposes a novelsystem that dynamically constructs a concept ontology based on the search results; whichvisualizes related concepts to the query in the form of ontology. The concept ontology canmake the PubMed search more effective by detecting related concepts and their relationhidden in the documents. The ontology can broaden the user's knowledge byrecommending new concepts unexpected by the user; and also serves to narrow down thesearch results by recommending additional query terms.

A Cache-Conscious Compression Index Based on the Level of Compression Locality,Won-Sik Kim; Jae-Jun Yoo; Jin-Soo Lee; Wook-Shin Han,Abstract As main memory get cheaper; it becomes increasingly affordable to load entireindex of DBMS and to access the index. Since speed gap between CPU and main memoryis growing bigger; many researches to reduce a cost of main memory access are under theprogress. As one of those; cache conscious trees can reduce the cost of main memoryaccess. Since cache conscious trees reduce the number of cache miss by compressing datain node; cache conscious trees can reduce the cost of main memory. Existing cacheconscious trees use only fixed one compression technique without consideration ofproperties of data in node. First; this paper proposes the DC-tree that uses variouscompression techniques and change data layout in a node according to properties of data inorder to reduce cache miss.

A Query by Humming System Using Humming Algebra,Je-Yong Shin; Wook-Shin Han; Jong-Hak Lee,Abstract Query by humming is an effective and intuitive querying mechanism when a userwants to find a song without knowing lyrics. The query by humming system takes a user-hummed melody as input; compares it with melodies in a music database; and returns top-ksimilar melodies to the input. In this paper; we propose a novel algebra for query byhumming; and design and implement a real query by humming system calledHummingBase by exploiting the algebra. By analyzing existing similarity search techniques;we derive 10 core operators for the algebra. By using the well-defined algebra; we caneasily implement such a system in a extensible and modular way. With two case studies; weshow that the proposed algebra can easily represent the query processing processes ofexisting query-by-humming systems.,Journal of KIISE: Computing Practices and Letters,2009,*

Range Subsequence Matching under Dynamic Time Warping,Wook-Shin Han; Jin-Soo Lee; Yang-Sae Moon,Abstract In this paper; we propose a range subsequence matching under dynamic timewarping (DTW) distance. We exploit Dual Match; which divides data sequences into disjointwindows and the query sequence into sliding windows. However; Dual Match is known towork under Euclidean distance. We argue that Euclidean distance is a fragile distance; andthus; DTW should be supported by Dual Match. For this purpose; we derive a new importanttheorem showing the correctness of our approach and provide a detailed algorithm usingthe theorem. Extensive experimental results show that our range subsequence matchingperforms much better than the sequential scan algorithm.,Journal of KIISE: Computing Practices and Letters,2008,*
T-Cache: a Fast Cache Manager for Pipeline Time-Series Data,Je-Yong Shin; Jin-Soo Lee; Won-Sik Kim; Seon-Hyo Kim; Min-A Yoon; Wook-Shin Han; Soon-Ki Jung; Se-Young Park,Abstract Intelligent pipeline inspection gauges (PIGs) are inspection vehicles that movealong within a (gas or oil) pipeline and acquire signals (also called sensor data) from theirsurrounding rings of sensors. By analyzing the signals captured in intelligent PIGs; we candetect pipeline defects; such as holes and curvatures and other potential causes of gasexplosions. There are two major data access patterns apparent when an analyzer accessesthe pipeline signal data. The first is a sequential pattern where an analyst reads the sensordata one time only in a sequential fashion. The second is the repetitive pattern where ananalyzer repeatedly reads the signal data within a fixed range; this is the dominant pattern inanalyzing the signal data. The existing PIG software reads signal data directly from theserver at every user# s request; requiring network transfer and disk access cost.

CC-GiST: A Generalized Framework for Efficiently Implementing Arbitrary Cache-Conscious Search Trees,Woong-Kee Loh; Won-Sik Kim; Wook-Shin Han,Abstract According to recent rapid price drop and capacity growth of main memory; thenumber of applications on main memory databases is dramatically increasing. Cache miss;which means a phenomenon that the data required by CPU is not resident in cache and isaccessed from main memory; is one of the major causes of performance degradation ofmain memory databases. Several cache-conscious trees have been proposed for reducingcache miss and making the most use of cache in main memory databases. Since eachcache-conscious tree has its own unique features; more than one cache-conscious tree canbe used in a single application depending on the applications requirement. Moreover; ifthere is no existing cache-conscious tree that satisfies the applications requirement; weshould implement a new cache-conscious tree only for the applications sake.

91 PRODUCTION OF A CLONED BOER GOAT (CAPRA HIRCUS) BY SOMATIC CELL NUCLEAR TRANSFER,Y Tao; W Han; M Zhang; J Ding; X Zhang,We reported the birth of a goat clone produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer. The fusionand activation protocols of reconstructed oocytes and embryo transfer procedure wereoptimized. The donors of somatic cells were fibroblasts derived from ear skin of a Boer goatwhile the recipient ooplasm was in vitro-matured oocytes of Huanghuai white goat; an Anhuinative goat species. The reconstructed embryos were activated by ionomycin; 6-dimethylaminopurine (6-DMAP); and cytochalasin B (CB) singly or simultaneously (termedas Ionomycin; Ionomycin+ 6-DMAP; and Ionomycin+ 6-DMAP+ CB). The result showed thatthe cleavage rate in single ionomycin was significantly lower than that in Ionomycin+ 6-DMAP and 6-DMAP+ CB (34.38% vs. 69.85% and 72.02%; P< 0.05).

Performance analysis of the cache conscious-generalized search tree,Won-Sik Kim; Woong-Kee Loh; Wook-Shin Han,Abstract Recently; a main memory index structure called the cache conscious-generalizedsearch tree (CC-GiST) was proposed. The CC-GiST is such a novel index structure that itcan be used for implementing all the existing cache conscious trees with the minimal efforts.It incorporates the pointer compression and the key compression techniques; which wereadopted by the existing cache conscious trees to reduce the cache misses; in a singleframework. In this paper; we formally analyze the performance of the CC-GiST. We comparethe performance of the CC-GiST with the existing cache conscious trees. The result showsthat the CC-GiST has the negligible overhead for supporting all the existing cache conscioustrees in a single framework; and the performance of the tree is almost unaffected.,International Conference on Computational Science,2006,*

Branching Path Query Processing for XML Documents using the Prefix Match Join,Young-Ho Park; Wook-Shin Han; Kyu-Young Whang,Abstract We propose XIR-Branching; a novel method for processing partial match queries onheterogeneous XML documents using information retrieval (IR) techniques and novelinstance join techniques. A partial match query is defined as the one having the descendent-or-self axis'//'in its path expression. In its general form; a partial match query has branchpredicates forming branching paths. The objective of XIR-Branching is to efficiently supportthis type of queries for large-scale documents of heterogeneous schemas. XIR-Branchinghas its basis on the conventional schema-level methods using relational tables (eg; XRel;XParent; XIR-Linear [21]) and significantly improves their efficiency and scalability using twotechniques: an inverted index technique and a novel prefix match join. The former supportslinear path expressions as the method used in XIR-Linear [21]. The latter supports …,Journal of KIISE: Databases,2005,*
Adaptive Row Major Order: a Performance Optimization Method of the Transform-space View Join,Min-Jae Lee; Wook-Shin Han; Kyu-Young Whang,Abstract A transform-space index indexes objects represented as points in the transformspace An advantage of a transform-space index is that optimization of join algorithms usingthese indexes becomes relatively simple. However; the disadvantage is that thesealgorithms cannot be applied to original-space indexes such as the R-tree. As a way ofovercoming this disadvantages; the authors earlier proposed the transform-space view joinalgorithm that joins two original-space indexes in the transform space through the notion ofthe transform-space view. A transform-space view is a virtual transform-space index thatallows us to perform join in the transform space using original-space indexes. In a transform-space view join algorithm; the order of accessing disk pages-for which various space fillingcurves could be used-makes a significant impact on the performance of joins.

Generalization of Window Construction for Subsequence Matching in Time-Series Databases,Yang-Sae Moon; Wook-Shin Han; Kyu-Young Whang,Abstract In this paper; we present the concept of generalization in constructing windows forsubsequence matching and propose a new subsequence matching method.

DualMatch; which has been proposedby the authors; improves performance significantly over FRM by exploiting the point filteringeffect; but it has the problem of having a smaller maximum window size (half that FRM) giventhe minimum query length. GeneralMatch; an improvement of DualMatch; offers advantagesof both methods: it can use large windows like FRM and; at the same time; can exploit thepoint-filtering effect like DualMatch.

A Cost-Based Buffer Replacement Algorithm in Object-Oriented Database Systems,Chong-Mok Park; Wook-Shin Han; Kyu-Young Whang,Abstract Many object oriented database systems manage object buffers to provide fastaccess to objects. Traditional buffer replacement algorithms based on fixed length pagessimply assume that the cost incurred by operating a buffer is propertional to the number ofbuffer faults. However; this assumption no longer holds in an objects buffer where objectsare of variable length and the cost of replacing an object varies for each object. In this paper;we propose a cost based replacement algorithm for object buffers. The proposed algorithmreplaces the have minimum costs per unit time and unit space. The cost model extends theprevious page based one to include the replacement costs and the sizes of objects. Theperformance tests show that proposed algorithm is almost always superior to the LRU-2algorithm and in some cases is more than twice as fast.
