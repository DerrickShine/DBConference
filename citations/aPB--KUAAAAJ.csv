SARS is thought to be caused by an unknown infectiousagent. Methods Clinical specimens from patients with SARS were searched for unknownviruses with the use of cell cultures and molecular techniques. Results A novel coronaviruswas identified in patients with SARS. The virus was isolated in cell culture; and a sequence300 nucleotides in length was obtained by a polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR)–basedrandom-amplification procedure. Genetic characterization indicated that the virus is onlydistantly related to known coronaviruses (identical in 50 to 60 percent of the nucleotidesequence). On the basis of the obtained sequence; conventional and real-time PCR assaysfor specific and sensitive detection of the novel virus were established.

Virus attenuation by genome-scale changes in codon pair bias,J Robert Coleman; Dimitris Papamichail; Steven Skiena; Bruce Futcher; Eckard Wimmer; Steffen Mueller,As a result of the redundancy of the genetic code; adjacent pairs of amino acids can beencoded by as many as 36 different pairs of synonymous codons. A species-specific “codonpair bias” provides that some synonymous codon pairs are used more or less frequentlythan statistically predicted. We synthesized de novo large DNA molecules using hundreds ofover-or underrepresented synonymous codon pairs to encode the poliovirus capsid protein.Underrepresented codon pairs caused decreased rates of protein translation; andpolioviruses containing such amino acid–independent changes were attenuated in mice.Polioviruses thus customized were used to immunize mice and provided protective immunityafter challenge. This “death by a thousand cuts” strategy could be generally applicable toattenuating many kinds of viruses.,Science,2008,429
Interaction of the poliovirus receptor with poliovirus,Yongning He; Valorie D Bowman; Steffen Mueller; Carol M Bator; Jordi Bella; Xiaozhong Peng; Timothy S Baker; Eckard Wimmer; Richard J Kuhn; Michael G Rossmann,Abstract The structure of the extracellular; three-domain poliovirus receptor (CD155)complexed with poliovirus (serotype 1) has been determined to 22-Å resolution by means ofcryo-electron microscopy and three-dimensional image-reconstruction techniques. Densitycorresponding to the receptor was isolated in a difference electron density map and fittedwith known structures; homologous to those of the three individual CD155 Ig-like domains.The fit was confirmed by the location of carbohydrate moieties in the CD155 glycoprotein;the conserved properties of elbow angles in the structures of cell surface molecules with Ig-like folds; and the concordance with prior results of CD155 and poliovirus mutagenesis.CD155 binds in the poliovirus “canyon” and has a footprint similar to that of the intercellularadhesion molecule-1 receptor on human rhinoviruses. However; the orientation of the …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2000,221
Nectin couples cell-cell adhesion and the actin scaffold at heterotypic testicular junctions,Kumi Ozaki-Kuroda; Hiroyuki Nakanishi; Hiroshi Ohta; Hiromitsu Tanaka; Hidetake Kurihara; Steffen Mueller; Kenji Irie; Wataru Ikeda; Tatsuo Sakai; Eckard Wimmer; Yoshitake Nishimune; Yoshimi Takai,Abstract Actin-based cell-cell adherens junctions (AJs) are crucial not only for mechanicaladhesion but also for cell morphogenesis and differentiation [1–4]. While organization ofhomotypic AJs is attributed mostly to classic cadherins; the adhesive mechanism ofheterotypic AJs in more complex tissues remains to be clarified. Nectin; a member of a familyof immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecules at various AJs; is a possible organizer ofheterotypic AJs because of its unique heterophilic trans-interaction property [5–10].Recently; nectin-2 (−/−) mice have been shown to exhibit the defective spermmorphogenesis and the male-specific infertility [11]; but the role of nectin in testicular AJshas not been investigated. We show here the heterotypic trans-interaction between nectin-2in Sertoli cells and nectin-3 in spermatids at Sertoli-spermatid junctions (SspJs) …,Current Biology,2002,219
Reduction of the rate of poliovirus protein synthesis through large-scale codon deoptimization causes attenuation of viral virulence by lowering specific infectivity,Steffen Mueller; Dimitris Papamichail; J Robert Coleman; Steven Skiena; Eckard Wimmer,ABSTRACT Exploring the utility of de novo gene synthesis with the aim of designing stablyattenuated polioviruses (PV); we followed two strategies to construct PV variants containingsynthetic replacements of the capsid coding sequences either by deoptimizing synonymouscodon usage (PV-AB) or by maximizing synonymous codon position changes of the existingwild-type (wt) poliovirus codons (PV-SD). Despite 934 nucleotide changes in the capsidcoding region; PV-SD RNA produced virus with wild-type characteristics. In contrast; noviable virus was recovered from PV-AB RNA carrying 680 silent mutations; due to areduction of genome translation and replication below a critical level. After subcloning ofsmaller portions of the AB capsid coding sequence into the wt background; several viableviruses were obtained with a wide range of phenotypes corresponding to their efficiency …,Journal of virology,2006,214
The DExD/H-box helicase Dicer-2 mediates the induction of antiviral activity in drosophila,Safia Deddouche; Nicolas Matt; Aidan Budd; Stefanie Mueller; Cordula Kemp; Delphine Galiana-Arnoux; Catherine Dostert; Christophe Antoniewski; Jules A Hoffmann; Jean-Luc Imler,Abstract Drosophila; like other invertebrates and plants; relies mainly on RNA interferencefor its defense against viruses. In flies; viral infection also triggers the expression of manygenes. One of the genes induced; Vago; encodes a 18-kilodalton cysteine-rich polypeptide.Here we provide genetic evidence that the Vago gene product controlled viral load in the fatbody after infection with drosophila C virus. Induction of Vago was dependent on thehelicase Dicer-2. Dicer-2 belongs to the same DExD/H-box helicase family as do the RIG-I–like receptors; which sense viral infection and mediate interferon induction in mammals. Wepropose that this family represents an evolutionary conserved set of sensors that detect viralnucleic acids and direct antiviral responses.,Nature immunology,2008,206
Live attenuated influenza virus vaccines by computer-aided rational design,Steffen Mueller; J Robert Coleman; Dimitris Papamichail; Charles B Ward; Anjaruwee Nimnual; Bruce Futcher; Steven Skiena; Eckard Wimmer,Abstract Despite existing vaccines and enormous efforts in biomedical research; influenzaannually claims 250;000–500;000 lives worldwide 1; motivating the search for new; moreeffective vaccines that can be rapidly designed and easily produced. We applied thepreviously described synthetic attenuated virus engineering (SAVE) 2 approach to influenzavirus strain A/PR/8/34 to rationally design live attenuated influenza virus vaccine candidatesthrough genome-scale changes in codon-pair bias. As attenuation is based on manyhundreds of nucleotide changes across the viral genome; reversion of the attenuated variantto a virulent form is unlikely. Immunization of mice by a single intranasal exposure to codonpair–deoptimized virus conferred protection against subsequent challenge with wild-type(WT) influenza virus. The method can be applied rapidly to any emerging influenza virus …,Nature biotechnology,2010,167

Interaction of the poliovirus receptor CD155 with the dynein light chain Tctex-1 and its implication for poliovirus pathogenesis,Steffen Mueller; Xuemei Cao; Reinhold Welker; Eckard Wimmer,Abstract The cellular receptor for poliovirus CD155 (or PVR) is the founding member of anew class of membrane-associated immunoglobulin-like proteins; which include the mousetumor-associated antigen E4 (Tage4) and three proteins termed “nectins.” Using a yeast two-hybrid screen we have discovered that the cytoplasmic domain of CD155 associatesstrongly and specifically with Tctex-1; a light chain of the dynein motor complex; the latterrepresenting the major driving force for retrograde transport of endocytic vesicles andmembranous organelles. We confirmed the interaction biochemically and by co-immunoprecipitation; and we mapped the Tctex-1 binding site to a SKCSR motif within thejuxtamembrane region of CD155. Tctex-1 immunoreactivity was detected in mouse sciaticnerve and spinal cord (two tissues of central importance for poliovirus pathogenesis) in …,Journal of Biological Chemistry,2002,147
Poliovirus and poliomyelitis: a tale of guts; brains; and an accidental event,Steffen Mueller; Eckard Wimmer; Jeronimo Cello,Abstract Nearly 100 years after its discovery poliovirus remains one of most thoroughlystudied and best understood virus models for the molecular virologist. While poliovirus hasbeen of vital importance for our insight into picornavirus biology at the cellular andbiochemical level; it is ironic to note that; due to the early success in defeating poliomyelitisin the developed world through vaccination; many of the basic aspects of polioviruspathogenesis remain poorly understood. This is chiefly due to the lack of an adequate andaffordable animal model; save of old world monkeys. Fundamental questions; such as theidentity of the target cells during the enteric phase of infection; or mechanisms of systemicspread are still unanswered. This review will attempt to summarize our current knowledge ofthe molecular biology of poliovirus; its pathogenesis; as well as recent advances in the …,*,2005,145
Hsp70 chaperones as modulators of prion life cycle: novel effects of Ssa and Ssb on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae prion [PSI+],Kim D Allen; Renee D Wegrzyn; Tatiana A Chernova; Susanne Müller; Gary P Newnam; Peggy A Winslett; Kristin B Wittich; Keith D Wilkinson; Yury O Chernoff,[PSI+] is a prion isoform of the yeast release factor Sup35. In some assays; the cytosolicchaperones Ssa1 and Ssb1/2 of the Hsp70 family were previously shown to exhibit “pro-[PSI+]” and “anti-[PSI+]” effects; respectively. Here; it is demonstrated for the first time thatexcess Ssa1 increases de novo formation of [PSI+] and that pro-[PSI+] effects of Ssa1 areshared by all other Ssa proteins. Experiments with chimeric constructs show that the peptide-binding domain is a major determinant of differences in the effects of Ssa and Ssb proteinson [PSI+]. Surprisingly; overproduction of either chaperone increases loss of [PSI+] whenSup35 is simultaneously overproduced. Excess Ssa increases both the average size ofprion polymers and the proportion of monomeric Sup35 protein. Both in vivo and in vitroexperiments uncover direct physical interactions between Sup35 and Hsp70 proteins …,Genetics,2005,138
Simultaneous genomic overexpression of seven glycolytic enzymes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Jörg Hauf; Friedrich K Zimmermann; Susanne Müller,Abstract Fusions of the glycolytic genes TPI1; PGK1; ENO1; PYK1; PDC1; and ADH1 withthe lacZ reporter gene of Escherichia coli and a lacZ fusion construct of a 390-bp fragmentfrom the promoter of the HXT7 gene were assayed for β-galactosidase activity. The glycolyticpromoters were induced after addition of glucose to ethanol-grown cells; whereas the HXT7promoter fragment showed a constitutive β-galactosidase expression on both carbonsources. The genes coding for the seven enzymes of lower glycolysis Tdh; Pgk; Gpm; Eno;Pyk; Pdc; and Adh were simultaneously put under the control of the same strong promoter; atruncated HXT7 promoter that is constitutively active on ethanol as well as on glucosemedium. Genomic expression of the glycolytic genes under the control of this promoter;resulted in an at least 2-fold overexpression.

Broad RNA interference–mediated antiviral immunity and virus-specific inducible responses in Drosophila,Cordula Kemp; Stefanie Mueller; Akira Goto; Vincent Barbier; Simona Paro; François Bonnay; Catherine Dostert; Laurent Troxler; Charles Hetru; Carine Meignin; Sébastien Pfeffer; Jules A Hoffmann; Jean-Luc Imler,The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a good model to unravel the molecular mechanismsof innate immunity and has led to some important discoveries about the sensing andsignaling of microbial infections. The response of Drosophila to virus infections remainspoorly characterized and appears to involve two facets. On the one hand; RNA interferenceinvolves the recognition and processing of dsRNA into small interfering RNAs by the hostRNase Dicer-2 (Dcr-2); whereas; on the other hand; an inducible response controlled by theevolutionarily conserved JAK-STAT pathway contributes to the antiviral host defense. Toclarify the contribution of the small interfering RNA and JAK-STAT pathways to the control ofviral infections; we have compared the resistance of flies wild-type and mutant for Dcr-2 orthe JAK kinase Hopscotch to infections by seven RNA or DNA viruses belonging to …,The Journal of Immunology,2013,117
Loss of nectin-2 at Sertoli-spermatid junctions leads to male infertility and correlates with severe spermatozoan head and midpiece malformation; impaired binding t...,Steffen Mueller; Thomas A Rosenquist; Yoshimi Takai; Richard A Bronson; Eckard Wimmer,Abstract The members of the nectin/CD155 gene family represent a growing class of novelcell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily. In the present study; wedescribe the generation of a mouse line lacking a functional nectin-2 gene (nectin-2LacZ/LacZ) and analyze the resulting male-specific infertility phenotype. Although nectin-2LacZ/LacZ males produced normal amounts of motile spermatozoa; scanning electronmicroscopy revealed severe malformations of the spermatozoan head and midpiece.Besides a 4-fold reduction in migration of nectin-2LacZ/LacZ spermatozoa to the oviducts; invitro binding to zona-intact mouse oocytes was reduced 6-fold. On the other hand; nectin-2LacZ/LacZ spermatozoa bound to zona-free hamster oocytes at near-wild type levels but;remarkably; failed to penetrate.

Pyrite-induced hydroxyl radical formation and its effect on nucleic acids,Corey A Cohn; Steffen Mueller; Eckard Wimmer; Nicole Leifer; Steven Greenbaum; Daniel R Strongin; Martin AA Schoonen,Abstract Background Pyrite; the most abundant metal sulphide on Earth; is known tospontaneously form hydrogen peroxide when exposed to water. In this study the hypothesisthat pyrite-induced hydrogen peroxide is transformed to hydroxyl radicals is tested. ResultsUsing a combination of electron spin resonance (ESR) spin-trapping techniques andscavenging reactions involving nucleic acids; the formation of hydroxyl radicals inpyrite/aqueous suspensions is demonstrated. The addition of EDTA to pyrite slurries inhibitsthe hydrogen peroxide-to-hydroxyl radical conversion; but does not inhibit the formation ofhydrogen peroxide. Given the stability of EDTA chelation with both ferrous and ferric iron;this suggests that the addition of the EDTA prevents the transformation by chelation ofdissolved iron species.

Synthetic viruses: a new opportunity to understand and prevent viral disease,Eckard Wimmer; Steffen Mueller; Terrence M Tumpey; Jeffery K Taubenberger,Abstract Rapid progress in DNA synthesis and sequencing is spearheading the deliberate;large-scale genetic alteration of organisms. These new advances in DNA manipulation havebeen extended to the level of whole-genome synthesis; as evident from the synthesis ofpoliovirus; from the resurrection of the extinct 1918 strain of influenza virus and of humanendogenous retroviruses and from the restructuring of the phage T7 genome. The largestDNA synthesized so far is the 582;970 base pair genome of Mycoplasma genitalium;although; as yet; this synthetic DNA has not been'booted'to life. As genome synthesis isindependent of a natural template; it allows modification of the structure and function of avirus's genetic information to an extent that was hitherto impossible.

Cell adhesion and proliferation on RGD-modified recombinant spider silk proteins,Stefanie Wohlrab; Susanne Müller; Andreas Schmidt; Stefanie Neubauer; Horst Kessler; Aldo Leal-Egaña; Thomas Scheibel,Abstract Due to the biocompatibility and biodegradability as well as the mechanicalproperties of the fibers; spider silk has become an attractive material for researchersregarding biomedical applications. In this study; the engineered recombinant spider silkprotein eADF4 (C16) was modified with the integrin recognition sequence RGD by a genetic(fusing the amino acid sequence GRGDSPG) as well as a chemical approach (using thecyclic peptide c (RGDfK)). Both modified silk proteins were processed into films; andthereafter characterized concerning secondary structure; water contact angle and surfaceroughness. No influence of the RGD-modifications on any of these film properties could bedetected.

Inhibition of filovirus replication by the zinc finger antiviral protein,Stefanie Müller; Peggy Möller; Matthew J Bick; Stephanie Wurr; Stephan Becker; Stephan Günther; Beate M Kümmerer,ABSTRACT The zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) was recently shown to inhibit Moloneymurine leukemia virus and Sindbis virus replication. We tested whether ZAP also actsagainst Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV). Antiviral effects were observed afterinfection of cells expressing the N-terminal part of ZAP fused to the product of the zeocinresistance gene (NZAP-Zeo) as well as after infection of cells inducibly expressing full-length ZAP. EBOV was inhibited by up to 4 log units; whereas MARV was inhibited between1 to 2 log units. The activity of ZAP was dependent on the integrity of the second and fourthzinc finger motif; as tested with cell lines expressing NZAP-Zeo mutants. Heterologousexpression of EBOV-and MARV-specific sequences fused to a reporter gene suggest thatZAP specifically targets L gene sequences. The activity of NZAP-Zeo in this assay was …,Journal of virology,2007,106

Potentiometric sensors based on surface molecular imprinting: Detection of cancer biomarkers and viruses,Yantian Wang; Zhiquan Zhang; Vijay Jain; Jinju Yi; Steffen Mueller; Jonathan Sokolov; Zhenxian Liu; Kalle Levon; Basil Rigas; Miriam H Rafailovich,Abstract The continuing discovery of cancer biomarkers necessitates improved methods fortheir detection. Molecular imprinting using artificial materials provides an alternative to thedetection of a wide range of substances. We applied surface molecular imprinting using self-assembled monolayers to design sensing elements for the detection of cancer biomarkersand other proteins. These elements consist of a gold-coated silicon chip onto which hydroxyl-terminated alkanethiol molecules and template biomolecule are co-adsorbed; where thethiol molecules are chemically bound to the metal substrate and self-assembled into highlyordered monolayers; the biomolecules can be removed; creating the foot-print cavities in themonolayer matrix for this kind of template molecules. Re-adsorption of the biomolecules tothe sensing chip changes its potential; which can be measured potentiometrically. We …,sensors and actuators B: Chemical,2010,100

Sensitivity tooral infection correlated with CD155 expression not only in the intestinal epithelium;including the follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) and microfold (M) cells of Peyer's patches;but also in germinal centers within the Peyer's patches. CD155 expression in rhesusmacaques was reduced in FAE and; significantly; absent in germinal centers. In CD155 Tgmice; CD155 expression was barely observable in the intestinal epithelium; absent ingerminal centers; but prominent in the tunica muscularis.

RNAi-mediated immunity provides strong protection against the negative-strand RNA vesicular stomatitis virus in Drosophila,Stefanie Mueller; Valérie Gausson; Nicolas Vodovar; Safia Deddouche; Laurent Troxler; Jonathan Perot; Sébastien Pfeffer; Jules A Hoffmann; Maria-Carla Saleh; Jean-Luc Imler,Abstract Activation of innate antiviral responses in multicellular organisms relies on therecognition of structural differences between viral and cellular RNAs. Double-stranded (ds)RNA; produced during viral replication; is a well-known activator of antiviral defenses andtriggers interferon production in vertebrates and RNAi in invertebrates and plants. Previouswork in mammalian cells indicates that negative-strand RNA viruses do not appear togenerate dsRNA; and that activation of innate immunity is triggered by the recognition of theuncapped 5′ ends of viral RNA. This finding raises the question whether antiviral RNAi;which is triggered by the presence of dsRNA in insects; represents an effective host-defensemechanism against negative-strand RNA viruses. Here; we show that the negative-strandRNA virus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) does not produce easily detectable amounts of …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2010,95
Histone deacetylase inhibitors impair the elimination of HIV-infected cells by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes,Richard Brad Jones; Rachel O'Connor; Stefanie Mueller; Maria Foley; Gregory L Szeto; Dan Karel; Mathias Lichterfeld; Colin Kovacs; Mario A Ostrowski; Alicja Trocha; Darrell J Irvine; Bruce D Walker,Resting memory CD4+ T-cells harboring latent HIV proviruses represent a critical barrier toviral eradication. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis); such as suberanilohydroxamicacid (SAHA); romidepsin; and panobinostat have been shown to induce HIV expression inthese resting cells. Recently; it has been demonstrated that the low levels of viral geneexpression induced by a candidate HDACi may be insufficient to cause the death of infectedcells by viral cytopathic effects; necessitating their elimination by immune effectors; such ascytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL). Here; we study the impact of three HDACis in clinicaldevelopment on T-cell effector functions. We report two modes of HDACi-induced functionalimpairment: i) the rapid suppression of cytokine production from viable T-cells induced by allthree HDACis ii) the selective death of activated T-cells occurring at later time-points …,PLoS pathogens,2014,92
ACE inhibitor versus β-blocker for the treatment of hypertension in renal allograft recipients,Martin Hausberg; Michael Barenbrock; Helge Hohage; Susanne Müller; Stefan Heidenreich; Karl-Heinz Rahn,Abstract—Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to slow theprogression of chronic renal failure. However; the value of ACE inhibitors for the treatment ofhypertension in renal allograft recipients has not been established. ACE inhibitors dilate theefferent glomerular arteriole; an effect that may aggravate the decrease in glomerularfiltration rate resulting from cyclosporine-induced vasoconstriction at the afferent glomerulararteriole. Therefore; the goal of this double-blind; randomized study was to compare theantihypertensive and renal effects of the ACE inhibitor quinapril with those of the β-blockeratenolol in renal allograft recipients in whom hypertension developed 6 to 12 weeks aftertransplantation.

Recruitment of nectin-3 to cell-cell junctions through trans-heterophilic interaction with CD155; a vitronectin and poliovirus receptor that localizes to αvβ3 integrin-co...,Steffen Mueller; Eckard Wimmer,Abstract Nectins present a novel class of Ig superfamily adhesion molecules that;cooperatively with cadherins; establish and maintain cell-cell adherens junctions. CD155;the cognate receptor for poliovirus; undergoes cell-matrix contacts by binding to theextracellular matrix protein vitronectin. The significant homology of nectins with CD155prompted us to investigate the possibility of their interaction. We determined that nectin-3binds CD155 and its putative mouse homologue Tage4 in cell-based ligand binding assays.Coculture of nectin-3-and CD155-expressing HeLa cells led to CD155-dependentrecruitment of nectin-3 to cell-cell contacts.

Simultaneous overexpression of enzymes of the lower part of glycolysis can enhance the fermentative capacity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Hans Peter Smits; Jörg Hauf; Susanne Müller; Timothy J Hobley; Friedrich K Zimmermann; Bärbel Hahn‐Hägerdal; Jens Nielsen; Lisbeth Olsson,Abstract Recombinant S. cerevisiae strains; with elevated levels of the enzymes of lowerglycolysis (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; phosphoglycerate mutase;phosphoglycerate kinase; enolase; pyruvate kinase; pyruvate decarboxylase and alcoholdehydrogenase) were physiologically characterized. During growth on glucose the enzymelevels in the recombinant strains (YHM4 and YHM7) were 1.1–3.4-fold higher than in thehost strain (CEN. PK. K45). The recombinant strains were grown in aerobic or anaerobicbatch cultures on glucose or a mixture of glucose and galactose. The specific ethanolproduction rates in the recombinant strains were the same as for the host strain and thephysiological behaviour of the recombinant strains and the host strain was similar.

Composite system mediates two-step DNA uptake into Helicobacter pylori,Kerstin Stingl; Stephanie Müller; Gerda Scheidgen-Kleyboldt; Martin Clausen; Berenike Maier,Abstract The Gram-negative gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori depends on naturaltransformation for genomic plasticity; which leads to host adaptation and spread ofresistances. Here; we show that H. pylori takes up covalently labeled fluorescent DNApreferentially at the cell poles and that uptake is dependent on the type IV secretion systemComB. By titration of external pH and detection of accessibility of the fluorophor by protons;we localized imported fluorescent DNA in the periplasm. Single molecule analysis revealedthat outer membrane DNA transport occurred at a velocity of 1.3 kbp· s− 1 and thatpreviously imported DNA was reversibly extracted from the bacterium at pulling forcesexceeding 23 pN. Thus; transport velocities were 10-fold higher than in Bacillus subtilis; andstalling forces were substantially lower. dsDNA stained with the intercalator YOYO-1 was …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2010,83

Andino; D. Silvera; SD Suggett; PI Achacoso;CJ Miller; D. Baltimore; and MB Feinberg (Science 265: 1448–1451; 1994); we constructedrecombinant polioviruses by fusing the open reading frame (ORF) of the green fluorescentprotein gene (gfp) of Aequorea victoria or the gag gene (encoding p17-p24) of humanimmunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to the N terminus of the poliovirus polyprotein. Allpoliovirus expression vectors constructed by us and those obtained from Andino et al. werefound to be severely impaired in viral replication and genetically unstable. Upon replication;inserted sequences were rapidly deleted as early as the first growth cycle in HeLa cells.However; the vector viruses did not readily revert to the wild-type sequence but ratherretained some of the insert plus the artificial 3C pro/3CD pro cleavage site; engineered …,Journal of virology,1998,83
Direct interaction between two viral proteins; the nonstructural protein 2CATPase and the capsid protein VP3; is required for enterovirus morphogenesis,Ying Liu; Chunling Wang; Steffen Mueller; Aniko V Paul; Eckard Wimmer; Ping Jiang,In spite of decades-long studies; the mechanism of morphogenesis of plus-stranded RNAviruses belonging to the genus Enterovirus of Picornaviridae; including poliovirus (PV); isnot understood. Numerous attempts to identify an RNA encapsidation signal have failed.Genetic studies; however; have implicated a role of the non-structural protein 2CATPase inthe formation of poliovirus particles. Here we report a novel mechanism in which protein-protein interaction is sufficient to explain the specificity in PV encapsidation. Making use of anovel “reporter virus”; we show that a quasi-infectious chimera consisting of the capsidprecursor of C-cluster coxsackie virus 20 (C-CAV20) and the nonstructural proteins of theclosely related PV translated and replicated its genome with wild type kinetics; whereasencapsidation was blocked. On blind passages; encapsidation of the chimera was …,PLoS pathogens,2010,82
Cardio-specific long-term gene expression in a porcine model after selective pressure-regulated retroinfusion of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors,PW Raake; R Hinkel; S Müller; S Delker; R Kreuzpointner; C Kupatt; HA Katus; JA Kleinschmidt; P Boekstegers; OJ Müller,Abstract Cornerstone for an efficient cardiac gene therapy is the need for a vector system;which enables selective and long-term expression of the gene of interest. In rodent animalmodels adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors like AAV-6 have been shown to efficientlytransduce cardiomyocytes. However; since significant species-dependent differences intransduction characteristics exist; large animal models are of imminent need for preclinicalevaluations. We compared gene transfer efficiencies of AAV-6 and heparin binding site-deleted AAV-2 vectors in a porcine model. Application of the AAVs was performed bypressure-regulated retroinfusion of the anterior interventricular cardiac vein; which has beenpreviously shown to efficiently deliver genes to the myocardium (3.5× 10 10 viral genomesper animal; n= 5 animals per group). All vectors harbored a luciferase reporter gene …,Gene therapy,2008,80
Novel replication-incompetent adenoviral B-group vectors: high vector stability and yield in PER. C6 cells,M Havenga; R Vogels; D Zuijdgeest; K Radosevic; S Mueller; M Sieuwerts; F Weichold; I Damen; J Kaspers; A Lemckert; M Van Meerendonk; R Van der Vlugt; L Holterman; D Hone; Y Skeiky; R Mintardjo; G Gillissen; D Barouch; J Sadoff; J Goudsmit,Adenoviral vectors based on adenovirus type 35 (rAd35) have the advantage of low naturalvector immunity and induce strong; insert-specific T-and B-cell responses; making themprime-candidate vaccine carriers. However; severe vector-genome instability of E1-deletedrAd35 vectors was observed; hampering universal use. The instability of E1-deleted rAd35vector proved to be caused by low pIX expression induced by removal of the pIX promoter;which was located in the E1B region of B-group viruses. Reinsertion of a minimal pIXpromoter resulted in stable vectors able to harbour large DNA inserts (> 5 kb). In addition; itis shown that replacement of the E4-Orf6 region of Ad35 by the E4-Orf6 region of Ad5resulted in successful propagation of an E1-deleted rAd35 vector on existing E1-complementing cell lines; such as PER.

We have recently shown that clonal embryonicEPCs (eEPCs); derived from 7.5-day-old mice; home specifically to hypoxic areas in tumormetastasis mouse models but spare normal organs and do not form carcinomas. Here; weassessed the potential of eEPCs to limit organ dysfunction after ischemia and reperfusion ina preclinical pig model. Methods and Results—Pigs were subjected to ischemia (60-minuteleft anterior descending [LAD] artery occlusion) and reperfusion (7 days). At the end ofischemia; we applied medium with or without 5× 10 6 eEPCs by either pressure-regulatedretroinfusion or intravenous transfusion.

Nanoparticulate STING agonists are potent lymph node–targeted vaccine adjuvants,Melissa C Hanson; Monica P Crespo; Wuhbet Abraham; Kelly D Moynihan; Gregory L Szeto; Stephanie H Chen; Mariane B Melo; Stefanie Mueller; Darrell J Irvine,The development of structure-based vaccinology using welldefined subunit antigens hasenabled the development of vaccines with excellent safety profiles; but this increase insafety has been accompanied by a decrease in immunogenicity compared with traditionallive-attenuated vaccines. Thus; adjuvants have become essential components of vaccineformulations in order to promote durable and effective immune responses to subunitvaccines (1–3). Traditional adjuvants; such as aluminum salts and water/oil emulsions; haveset the standard for safety and efficacy in vaccine development but fail to elicit effectiveimmune responses to many candidate antigens; and diverse new adjuvant formulationshave been pursued in both academic and industrial vaccine research (4).

Crystal structure of CD155 and electron microscopic studies of its complexes with polioviruses,Ping Zhang; Steffen Mueller; Marc C Morais; Carol M Bator; Valorie D Bowman; Susan Hafenstein; Eckard Wimmer; Michael G Rossmann,Abstract When poliovirus (PV) recognizes its receptor; CD155; the virus changes from a160S to a 135S particle before releasing its genome into the cytoplasm. CD155 is atransmembrane protein with 3 Ig-like extracellular domains; D1–D3; where D1 is recognizedby the virus. The crystal structure of D1D2 has been determined to 3.5-Å resolution and fittedinto≈ 8.5-Å resolution cryoelectron microscopy reconstructions of the virus–receptorcomplexes for the 3 PV serotypes. These structures show that; compared with humanrhinoviruses; the virus–receptor interactions for PVs have a greater dependence onhydrophobic interactions; as might be required for a virus that can inhabit environments ofdifferent pH. The pocket factor was shown to remain in the virus during the first recognitionstage. The present structures; when combined with earlier mutational investigations …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2008,68
Different internal metabolites trigger the induction of glycolytic gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,S Müller; Eckhard Boles; Monika May; Friedrich K Zimmermann,ABSTRACT In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae; the sugar-induced expression ofvarious genes coding for glycolytic enzymes is triggered by increases in the concentrationsof different internal metabolites. Here; we show that the induction of the glycolytic isoenzymeenolase 2 is strictly dependent on the abilities of different mutant strains to increase the levelof glucose-6-phosphate after the addition of sugars. In contrast; the induction of alcoholdehydrogenase I is dependent on increasing concentrations of metabolites in the late stagesof glycolysis.,Journal of bacteriology,1995,65
Oncolytic treatment and cure of neuroblastoma by a novel attenuated poliovirus in a novel poliovirus-susceptible animal model,Hidemi Toyoda; Jiang Yin; Steffen Mueller; Eckard Wimmer; Jeronimo Cello,Neuroblastoma is one of the most common solid tumors in children. Treatment is of limitedutility for high-risk neuroblastoma and prognosis is poor. Resistance of neuroblastoma toconventional therapies has prompted us to search for a novel therapeutic approach basedon genetically modified polioviruses. Poliovirus targets motor neurons leading to irreversibleparalysis. Neurovirulence can be attenuated by point mutations or by exchange of geneticelements between different picornaviruses. We have developed a novel and stableattenuated poliovirus; replicating in neuroblastoma cells; by engineering an indigenousreplication element (cre); copied from a genome-internal site; into the 5′-nontranslatedgenomic region (mono-crePV). An additional host range mutation (A 133 G) conferredreplication in mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro-2a CD155) expressing CD155; the …,Cancer research,2007,64
Complexes of poliovirus serotypes with their common cellular receptor; CD155,Yongning He; Steffen Mueller; Paul R Chipman; Carol M Bator; Xiaozhong Peng; Valorie D Bowman; Suchetana Mukhopadhyay; Eckard Wimmer; Richard J Kuhn; Michael G Rossmann,ABSTRACT Structures of all three poliovirus (PV) serotypes (PV1; PV2; and PV3) complexedwith their cellular receptor; PV receptor (PVR or CD155); were determined by cryoelectronmicroscopy. Both glycosylated and fully deglycosylated CD155 exhibited similar bindingsites and orientations in the viral canyon for all three PV serotypes; showing that all threeserotypes use a common mechanism for cell entry. Difference maps between theglycosylated and deglycosylated CD155 complexes determined the sites of thecarbohydrate moieties that; in turn; helped to verify the position of the receptor relative to theviral surface. The proximity of the CD155 carbohydrate site at Asn105 to the viral surface inthe receptor-virus complex suggests that it might interfere with receptor docking; anobservation consistent with the properties of mutant CD155.

Gene expression patterns of epithelial cells modulated by pathogenicity factors of Yersinia enterocolitica,E Bohn; S Müller; J Lauber; R Geffers; N Speer; C Spieth; J Krejci; B Manncke; J Buer; A Zell; IB Autenrieth,Summary Epithelial cells express genes whose products signal the presence of pathogenicmicroorganisms to the immune system. Pathogenicity factors of enteric bacteria modulatehost cell gene expression. Using microarray technology we have profiled epithelial cell geneexpression upon interaction with Yersinia enterocolitica. Yersinia enterocolitica wild-typeand isogenic mutant strains were used to identify host genes modulated by invasin protein(Inv); which is involved in enteroinvasion; and Yersinia outer protein P (YopP) which inhibitsinnate immune responses. Among 22 283 probesets (14 239 unique genes); we found 193probesets (165 genes) to be regulated by Yersinia infection. The majority of these geneswere induced by Inv; whose recognition leads to expression of NF-κB-regulated factors suchas cytokines and adhesion molecules.

Highly-anisotropic liquid-crystal mixtures for tunable microwave devices,C Weil; P Scheele; P Best; G Lüssem; R Jakoby,Progress in the microwave dielectric properties of novel liquid crystal (LC) mixtures isreported; specially designed for voltage-tunable microwave devices. These advancedmixtures possess much higher microwave dielectric anisotropy and much lower loss tangentthan standard LC substances such as K15 of Merck. Moreover; with Δn= 0.37 at 26 GHzthose novel LC mixtures exhibit by far the highest microwave anisotropy at roomtemperature; known from literature. Compared to a former approach with K15; the figure-of-merit of a tunable microstrip-phase shifter device has been increased significantly from20°/dB up to 110°/dB; both measured at 24 GHz. To the authors knowledge; this is the bestvalue demonstrated for a tunable phase shifter based on nonlinear dielectrics above 20GHz; up to now. This substantial progress opens up totally new low-cost LC applications …,electronics letters,2003,59
Full 3D translational and rotational optical control of multiple rod‐shaped bacteria,Florian Hörner; Mike Woerdemann; Stephanie Müller; Berenike Maier; Cornelia Denz,Abstract The class of rod-shaped bacteria is an important example of non-spherical objectswhere defined alignment is desired for the observation of intracellular processes or studiesof the flagella. However; all available methods for orientational control of rod-shapedbacteria are either limited with respect to the accessible rotational axes or feasible angles orrestricted to one single bacterium. In this paper we demonstrate a scheme to orientate rod-shaped bacteria with holographic optical tweezers (HOT) in any direction. While thesebacteria have a strong preference to align along the direction of the incident laser beam; ourscheme provides for the first time full rotational control of multiple bacteria with respect toany arbitrary axis. In combination with the translational control HOT inherently provide; thisenables full control of all three translational and the two important rotational degrees of …,Journal of biophotonics,2010,57
Prion variant maintained only at high levels of the Hsp104 disaggregase,Andrey S Borchsenius; Susanne Müller; Gary P Newnam; Sergey G Inge-Vechtomov; Yury O Chernoff,Abstract The yeast prion [PSI+] is a self-perpetuating aggregated isoform of the translationtermination factor Sup35.[PSI+] propagation is promoted by moderate levels andantagonized by high levels of the chaperone Hsp104. In agreement with the modelpostulating that excess Hsp104 acts on [PSI+] by disaggregating prion polymers; we showthat an increase in Sup35 levels; accompanied by an increase in size of prion aggregates;also partially protects [PSI+] from elimination by excess Hsp104. Despite retention of [PSI+];excess Hsp104 decreases toxicity of overproduced Sup35 in [PSI+] strains. A heritablevariant of [PSI+]; which has been isolated and is maintained only in the presence ofincreased levels of Hsp104; is characterized by an abnormally large aggregate size; andexhibits an altered response to overproduction of the Hsp70 chaperone Ssa1.

The C-terminal residues of poliovirus proteinase 2Apro are critical for viral RNA replication but not for cis-or trans-proteolytic cleavage,Xiaoyu Li; Hui-Hua Lu; Steffen Mueller; Eckard Wimmer,Poliovirus proteinase 2Apro is an essential enzyme involved in cleavages of viral andcellular proteins during the infectious cycle. Evidence has been obtained that 2Apro is alsoinvolved in genome replication. All enteroviruses have a negatively charged cluster of aminoacids at their C terminus (EE/DE/DAMEQ–NH2); a common motif suggesting function. Whenaligned with enterovirus sequences; the 2Apro proteinase of human rhinovirus type 2(HRV2) has a shorter C terminus (EE… Q–NH2) and; indeed; the HRV2 2Apro cannotsubstitute for poliovirus 2Apro to yield a viable chimeric virus. Here evidence is provided thatthe C-terminal cluster of amino acids plays an unknown role in poliovirus genomereplication. Deletion of the EEAME sequence from poliovirus 2Apro is lethal withoutsignificantly influencing proteinase function. On the other hand; addition of EAME to …,Journal of General Virology,2001,51
Studies on structural changes of the carotid arteries and the heart in asymptomatic renal transplant recipients.,Bahava Suwelack; Jan Witta; Martin Hausberg; Susanne Müller; Karl-Heinz Rahn; Michael Barenbrock,Abstract BACKGROUND: The present study was designed to characterize early structuralchanges of large arteries in renal transplant recipients with no clinical evidence ofcardiovascular disease and normal blood pressure values; and to analyse the relationshipbetween arterial alterations and those of the heart. METHODS: Intima media thickness andatherosclerotic plaques of the carotid arteries as well as left ventricular geometry andfunction were examined in 35 asymtomatic renal transplant recipients and 29 age-and sex-matched healthy controls by high resolution B-mode ultrasound and by echocardiography.RESULTS: Intima-media thickness of the carotid arteries was significantly higher in renaltransplant recipients (1.21+/-0.08 mm) than in healthy controls (0.74+/-0.04 mm)(P< 0.001).Atherosclerotic plaques were found in the majority of renal transplant recipients (71% vs …,Nephrology; dialysis; transplantation: official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association-European Renal Association,1999,51
Mutant studies of phosphofructo-2-kinases do not reveal an essential role of fructose-2; 6-bisphosphate in the regulation of carbon fluxes in yeast cells,Susanne Müller; Friedrich K Zimmermann; Eckhard Boles,Summary: The effect of the allosteric regulator fructose-2; 6-bisphosphate (F2; 6bP) on theregulation of carbohydrate metabolism was investigated in vivo with Saccharomycescerevisiae mutants containing no; very high or unregulated 6-phosphofructo-2-kinaseactivity. Simultaneous overproduction of F2; 6bP and 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase activity didnot increase the glycolytic flux to ethanol. Overexpression of fructose-1; 6-bisphosphataseduring growth on glucose in a mutant strain devoid of F2; 6bP did not cause pronouncedeffects on the cells. Moreover; high levels of F2; 6bP during growth on ethanol in a strainwith a highly active 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase enzyme did not affect either carbon flux toglycogen or growth rate.

Dicing with viruses: microRNAs as antiviral factors,Stefanie Müller; Jean-Luc Imler,Viruses are the most abundant pathogens on earth; and resistance of cells to infection dependson their capacity to detect and control the replication of viral nucleic acids. In plants andinvertebrates; long double stranded (ds) RNAs are recognized and processed by members ofthe Dicer family. These endoribonuclease III enzymes generate 21–25 base pair small interfering(si) RNA duplexes. One strand of the duplex; the “guide” strand; is then transferred to an effectorcomplex; the RNA-induced silencing complex or RISC; whereas the “passenger” strand isdegraded. The RISC complex contains a member of the Argonaute family; which cleaves theRNA molecules targeted by the guide strand. This scheme enables host cells to detectdsRNAs; a hallmark of replication of many viruses; and to activate a nuclease that relies on thebase pairing of complementary sequences to specifically degrade viral genomes.

Impact of MHC class I alleles on the M. tuberculosis antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell response in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis,FF Weichold; S Mueller; C Kortsik; WE Hitzler; MJ Wulf; DM Hone; JC Sadoff; MJ Maeurer,Abstract Challenged by scattered understanding of protective immunity to Mycobacteriumtuberculosis (MTB); we have mapped peptide epitopes to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A* 0101; A* 0201; A* 1101; A* 2402; B* 0702; B* 0801 and B* 1501 of the secretedmycobacterial antigen Ag85B; a vaccine candidate that may be associated with immuneprotection. Affinity (ED 50) and half-life (t 1/2; off-rate) analysis for individual peptide specieson HLA-A and HLA-B molecules revealed binding ranges between 10− 3 and 10− 7 M. Afterselection of the best matches; major histocompatibility complex class I/peptide tetramercomplexes were constructed to measure the CD8+ T-cell responses directly ex vivo inperipheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from 57 patients with acute pulmonarytuberculosis.

Deliberate reduction of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase expression of influenza virus leads to an ultraprotective live vaccine in mice,Chen Yang; Steven Skiena; Bruce Futcher; Steffen Mueller; Eckard Wimmer,Abstract A long-held dogma posits that strong presentation to the immune system of thedominant influenza virus glycoprotein antigens neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin (HA)is paramount for inducing protective immunity against influenza virus infection. We havedeliberately violated this dogma by constructing a recombinant influenza virus strain ofA/PR8/34 (H1N1) in which expression of NA and HA genes was suppressed. We down-regulated NA and HA expression by recoding the respective genes with suboptimal codonpair bias; thereby introducing hundreds of nucleotide changes while preserving their codonuse and protein sequence. The variants PR8-NA Min; PR8-HA Min; and PR8-(NA+ HA) Min(Min; minimal expression) were used to assess the contribution of reduced glycoproteinexpression to growth in tissue culture and pathogenesis in BALB/c mice.

For more than two years itis operated on La Palma; Canary Islands (Spain); for the purpose of long-term monitoring ofastrophysical sources. For this; the performance of the photo detectors is crucial andtherefore has been studied in great detail. Special care has been taken for their temperatureand voltage dependence implementing a correction method to keep their properties stable.Several measurements have been carried out to monitor the performance.

Expression of the human poliovirus receptor/CD155 gene is activated by sonic hedgehog,David J Solecki; Matthias Gromeier; Steffen Mueller; Günter Bernhardt; Eckard Wimmer,Abstract The human poliovirus receptor/CD155 is a transmembrane glycoprotein belongingto the immunoglobulin superfamily. The ectodomain of CD155 mediates cell attachment tothe extracellular matrix molecule vitronectin; while its intracellular domain interacts with thedynein light chain Tctex-1. CD155 is a primate-restricted gene that is expressed duringdevelopment in mesenchymal tissues and ventrally derived structures within the CNS. Itsfunction in adults is as yet unknown; but significantly; CD155 is aberrantly expressed inneuroectodermal tumors. We show that the expression of CD155 mRNA is up-regulatedwhen human Ntera2 cells are treated with purified Sonic hedgehog (Shh) protein. Reportergene expression driven by theCD155 core promoter is activated by Shh in transient co-transfection assays. Analysis of the CD155 core promoter indicates that an intact GLI …,Journal of Biological Chemistry,2002,45
Smokeless tobacco and oral cancer in South Asia: a systematic review with meta-analysis,Zohaib Khan; Justus Tönnies; Steffen Müller,Introduction. Smokeless tobacco is considered one of the major risk factors for oral cancer. Itis estimated that over 90% of the global smokeless tobacco use burden is in South Asia.This paper aims to systematically review publications reporting epidemiologicalobservational studies published in South Asia from 1984 till 2013. Methods. An electronicsearch in “Medline” and “ISI Web of Knowledge” yielded 734 publications out of which 21were included in this review. All publications were assessed for quality using a standardquality assessment tool. Effect estimates (odds ratios (OR)) were abstracted or calculatedfrom the given data. A random effects meta-analysis was performed to assess the risk of oralcancer with the use of different forms of smokeless tobacco. Results and Conclusion.

Putting synthesis into biology: a viral view of genetic engineering through de novo gene and genome synthesis,Steffen Mueller; J Robert Coleman; Eckard Wimmer,Summary The rapid improvements in DNA synthesis technology hold the potential torevolutionize biosciences in the near future. Traditional genetic engineering methods aretemplate dependent and make extensive but laborious use of site-directed mutagenesis toexplore the impact of small variations on an existing sequence “theme.” De novo gene andgenome synthesis frees the investigator from the restrictions of the pre-existing template andallows for the rational design of any conceivable new sequence theme. Viruses; beingamong the simplest replicating entities; have been at the forefront of the advancingbiosciences since the dawn of molecular biology. Viral genomes; especially those of RNAviruses; are relatively short; often less than 10;000 bases long; making them amenable towhole genome synthesis with the currently available technology. For this reason viruses …,*,2009,41
A lipid zipper triggers bacterial invasion,Thorsten Eierhoff; Björn Bastian; Roland Thuenauer; Josef Madl; Aymeric Audfray; Sahaja Aigal; Samuel Juillot; Gustaf E Rydell; Stefan Müller; Sophie de Bentzmann; Anne Imberty; Christian Fleck; Winfried Römer,Abstract Glycosphingolipids are important structural constituents of cellular membranes.They are involved in the formation of nanodomains (“lipid rafts”); which serve as importantsignaling platforms. Invasive bacterial pathogens exploit these signaling domains to triggeractin polymerization for the bending of the plasma membrane and the engulfment of thebacterium—a key process in bacterial uptake. However; it is unknown whetherglycosphingolipids directly take part in the membrane invagination process. Here; wedemonstrate that a “lipid zipper;” which is formed by the interaction between the bacterialsurface lectin LecA and its cellular receptor; the glycosphingolipid Gb3; triggers plasmamembrane bending during host cell invasion of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Invitro experiments with Gb3-containing giant unilamellar vesicles revealed that LecA/Gb3 …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2014,40
Regulation of chaperone effects on a yeast prion by cochaperone Sgt2,Denis A Kiktev; Jesse C Patterson; Susanne Müller; Bhawana Bariar; Tao Pan; Yury O Chernoff,ABSTRACT Yeast prions; based on self-seeded highly ordered fibrous aggregates(amyloids); serve as a model for human amyloid diseases. Propagation of yeast prionsdepends on the balance between chaperones of the Hsp100 and Hsp70 families. The yeastprion [PSI+] can be eliminated by an excess of the chaperone Hsp104. This effect isreversed by an excess of the chaperone Hsp70-Ssa. Here we show that the actions ofHsp104 and Ssa on [PSI+] are modulated by the small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptidecochaperone Sgt2. Sgt2 is conserved from yeast to humans; has previously been implicatedin the g uided e ntry of t ail-anchored proteins (GET) trafficking pathway; and is known tointeract with Hsps; cytosolic Get proteins; and tail-anchored proteins. We demonstrate thatSgt2 increases the ability of excess Ssa to counteract [PSI+] curing by excess Hsp104 …,Molecular and cellular biology,2012,40

Role of vacA and cagA inHelicobacter pylori Inhibition of Mucin Synthesis in Gastric Mucous Cells,Winfried Beil; Marie Luise Enss; Simone Müller; Barbara Obst; Karl-Friedrich Sewing; Siegfried Wagner,ABSTRACT The aim of this study was to investigate the effect ofHelicobacter pylori on thefunction of gastric mucous cells. H. pylori (10 4 to 10 7 CFU/well) was incubated with themucin-producing gastric cell line HM02 for 12 and 24 h. Mucin synthesis and secretion weredetermined by the incorporation of dN-[acetyl-14 C] glucosamine into intracellular andreleased high-molecular-weight glycoproteins. cagA-positive; cytotoxin-producing and non-cytotoxin-producing H. pylori strains impaired the incorporation of dN-[acetyl-14 C]glucosamine into intracellular glycoproteins. Significant inhibition of mucin synthesis wasnoted after 12 and 24 h of cocultivation with a bacterial load of≥ 10 5 bacteria(bacterium/cell ratio= 0.25). The cagA-positive; cytotoxin-producing strains (HP64; HP57;and HP87) caused significantly stronger inhibition of intracellular mucin synthesis than …,Journal of clinical microbiology,2000,38

Mutational analysis of the Lassa virus promoter,Meike Hass; Martina Westerkofsky; Stefanie Müller; Beate Becker-Ziaja; Carola Busch; Stephan Günther,ABSTRACT The promoter sequences directing viral gene expression and genomereplication of arenaviruses reside within the 3′ and 5′ termini of each RNA segment. Theterminal 19 nucleotides at both ends are highly conserved among all arenavirus speciesand are almost completely complementary to each other. This study aimed at characterizingthe Lassa virus promoter in detail. The relevance of each position in the promoter wasstudied by site-directed mutagenesis using the Lassa virus minireplicon system. The dataindicate that the Lassa virus promoter functions as a duplex; regulates transcription andreplication in a coordinated manner; and is composed of two functional elements; asequence-specific region from residue 1 to 12 and a variable complementary region fromresidue 13 to 19. The first region appears to interact with the replication complex mainly …,Journal of virology,2006,37
Bacteria induce CTGF and CYR61 expression in epithelial cells in a lysophosphatidic acid receptor-dependent manner,Nina Wiedmaier; Steffen Müller; Martin Köberle; Birgit Manncke; Juliane Krejci; Ingo B Autenrieth; Erwin Bohn,Abstract Cysteine-rich protein 61 (Cyr61/CCN1) and connective tissue growth factor(CTGF/CCN2) are members of the CCN (CYR61; CTGF; nephroblastoma overexpressedgene) family and exert pleiotropic functions such as regulation of adhesion; migration;extracellular matrix deposition; or cell differentiation; and play an important role in woundhealing. This study focused on the nature of the so far unknown CTGF and CYR61 mRNAexpression of epithelial cells after infection with bacteria. We demonstrate that infection ofepithelial cells with attenuated Yersinia enterocolitica lacking the virulence plasmid pYVleads to the expression of CYR61 and CTGF. Virulent Y. enterocolitica bearing the pYVvirulence plasmid suppressed the mRNA expression of these genes. Yersinia-mediatedinhibition of CTGF and CYR61 mRNA expression is partially mediated by the cysteine …,International Journal of Medical Microbiology,2008,36

Sera of 390 heart failurepatients were tested for the presence of anti-TNI antibodies by enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA); including 249 (63.8% of total) patients with dilatedcardiomyopathy (DCM) and 141 (36.2% of total) patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy(ICM). A total of 72 patients (18.5% of total) were female and 318 (81.5% of total) were male.Mean patient age was 54.6±11.3 years and mean follow-up time was 3.8±3.2 years. TNI-autoantibodies (titer of≥ 1: 40) were detected in 73 out of 390 patients (18.7% of total). InTNI-autoantibody positive patients mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was27.6±5.8%; compared to 25.8±5.9% in TNI-autoantibody negative patients; P= 0.03.

Attenuation of human respiratory syncytial virus by genome-scale codon-pair deoptimization,Cyril Le Nouën; Linda G Brock; Cindy Luongo; Thomas McCarty; Lijuan Yang; Masfique Mehedi; Eckard Wimmer; Steffen Mueller; Peter L Collins; Ursula J Buchholz; Joshua M DiNapoli,Abstract Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important viral agent of seriouspediatric respiratory-tract disease worldwide. A vaccine or generally effective antiviral drugis not yet available. We designed new live attenuated RSV vaccine candidates by codon-pair deoptimization (CPD). Specifically; viral ORFs were recoded by rearranging existingsynonymous codons to increase the content of underrepresented codon pairs. Amino acidcoding was completely unchanged. Four CPD RSV genomes were designed in which theindicated ORFs were recoded: Min A (NS1; NS2; N; P; M; and SH); Min B (G and F); Min L(L); and Min FLC (all ORFs except M2-1 and M2-2). Surprisingly; the recombinant CPDviruses were temperature-sensitive for replication in vitro (level of sensitivity: Min FLC> MinL> Min B> Min A).

Regulation of expression of atypical orphan response regulators of Helicobacter pylori,Stefanie Müller; Michael Pflock; Jennifer Schär; Simone Kennard; Dagmar Beier,Summary The human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori exhibits a remarkably smallrepertoire of transcriptional regulators including three complete two-component systems aswell as the orphan response regulators HP1021 and HP1043. Both HP1021 and HP1043show atypical receiver sequences and are required for the normal cell growth of H. pylori.Recently; we demonstrated that phosphorylation of HP1021 and HP1043 according to thetwo-component paradigm is not a prerequisite for the cell growth-associated functions ofthese response regulators; raising the question of how the activity of this regulatory proteinsis modulated. Here; we report that strict transcriptional control of its expression is notinvolved in the cell-growth associated function of HP1021. We show that expression ofhp1043 is controlled both on the post-transcriptional or post-translational level and by …,Microbiological research,2007,34
A subset of latency-reversing agents expose HIV-infected resting CD4+ T-cells to recognition by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes,R Brad Jones; Stefanie Mueller; Rachel O’Connor; Katherine Rimpel; Derek D Sloan; Dan Karel; Hing C Wong; Emily K Jeng; Allison S Thomas; James B Whitney; So-Yon Lim; Colin Kovacs; Erika Benko; Sara Karandish; Szu-Han Huang; Maria J Buzon; Mathias Lichterfeld; Alivelu Irrinki; Jeffrey P Murry; Angela Tsai; Helen Yu; Romas Geleziunas; Alicja Trocha; Mario A Ostrowski; Darrell J Irvine; Bruce D Walker,Resting CD4+ T-cells harboring inducible HIV proviruses are a critical reservoir inantiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated subjects. These cells express little to no viral protein; andthus neither die by viral cytopathic effects; nor are efficiently cleared by immune effectors.Elimination of this reservoir is theoretically possible by combining latency-reversing agents(LRAs) with immune effectors; such as CD8+ T-cells. However; the relative efficacy ofdifferent LRAs in sensitizing latently-infected cells for recognition by HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells has not been determined. To address this; we developed an assay that utilizes HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell clones as biosensors for HIV antigen expression. By testing multipleCD8+ T-cell clones against a primary cell model of HIV latency; we identified several singleagents that primed latently-infected cells for CD8+ T-cell recognition; including IL-2; IL-15 …,PLoS pathogens,2016,33

Basic investigations of 35 GHz reflectarrays and tunable unit-cells for beam steering applications,Radu Marin; A Mossinger; Jens Freese; S Muller; Rolf Jakoby,Three realisations of 35 GHz reflect arrays with fixed beam are presented. The first single-layered reflect array uses variable patches as phase-shifting element and serves asreference. The second one; employing patches of variable size loaded with variable lengthslots in the ground plane; and the third one; a double-layered reflect array using stackedpatches of variable size; are designed to achieve higher bandwidth. In the second part of thepaper a novel concept for a tunable reflect array unit cell using liquid crystals is presentedand verified. Measurements performed in a waveguide simulator were able to demonstrate300/spl deg/phase tunability of a unit cell; by applying voltages up to 40 V.,Microwave Conference; 2005 European,2005,32
Investigation of two yeast genes encoding putative isoenzymes of phosphoglycerate mutase,Jürgen J Heinisch; Susanne Müller; Elke Schlüter; Jörg Jacoby; Rosaura Rodicio,Abstract Our previous data indicated that GPM1 encodes the only functionalphosphoglycerate mutase in yeast. However; in the course of the yeast genome sequencingproject; two homologous sequences; designated GPM2 and GPM3; were detected. Theyhave been further investigated in this work. Key residues in the deduced amino acidsequence; shown to be involved in catalysis for Gpm1 (ie His8; Arg59; His181) areconserved in both enzymes. Overexpression of the genes under control of their ownpromoters in a gpm1 deletion mutant did not complement for any of the phenotypes. Thiscould in part be attributed to a lack of expression due to their weak promoters. Higher levelexpression under the control of the yeast PFK2 promoter partially complemented the gpm1defects; without restoring detectable enzymatic activity. Nevertheless; deletion of either …,Yeast,1998,32
Nonlocal transport via edge states in InAs/GaSb coupled quantum wells,Susanne Mueller; Atindra Nath Pal; Matija Karalic; Thomas Tschirky; Christophe Charpentier; Werner Wegscheider; Klaus Ensslin; Thomas Ihn,Abstract We have investigated low-temperature electronic transport on InAs/GaSb doublequantum wells; a system which promises to be electrically tunable from a normal to atopological insulator. Hall bars of 50 μ m in length down to a few micrometers graduallydevelop a pronounced resistance plateau near charge neutrality; which comes along withdistinct nonlocal transport along the edges. Plateau resistances are found to be above orbelow the quantized value expected for helical edge channels. We discuss these resultsbased on the interplay between imperfect edges and residual local bulk conductivity.,Physical Review B,2015,31
Yersinia YopP-induced apoptotic cell death in murine dendritic cells is partially independent from action of caspases and exhibits necrosis-like features,Sabine Gröbner; Stella E Autenrieth; Irena Soldanova; Dani SJ Gunst; Martin Schaller; Erwin Bohn; Steffen Müller; Martin Leverkus; Sebastian Wesselborg; Ingo B Autenrieth; Stefan Borgmann,Abstract Yersinia outer protein P (YopP) is a virulence factor of Yersinia enterocolitica that isinjected into the cytosol of host cells where it targets MAP kinase kinases (MKKs) andinhibitor of κB kinase (IKK)-β resulting in inhibition of cytokine production as well asinduction of apoptosis in murine macrophages and dendritic cells (DC). Here we show thatDC death was only partially prevented by the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk;indicating simultaneous caspase-dependent and caspase-independent mechanisms of celldeath induction by YopP. Microscopic analyses and measurement of cell size demonstratednecrosis-like morphology of caspase-independent cell death. Application of zVAD-fmkprevented cleavage of procaspases and Bid; decrease of the inner transmembranemitochondrial potential ΔΨ m and mitochondrial release of cytochrome c.

Identification of two functionally redundant RNA elements in the coding sequence of poliovirus using computer-generated design,Yutong Song; Ying Liu; Charles B Ward; Steffen Mueller; Bruce Futcher; Steven Skiena; Aniko V Paul; Eckard Wimmer,Abstract Genomes of RNA viruses contain multiple functional RNA elements required fortranslation or RNA replication. We use unique approaches to identify functional RNAelements in the coding sequence of poliovirus (PV); a plus strand RNA virus. The generalmethod is to recode large segments of the genome using synonymous codons; such thatprotein sequences; codon use; and codon pair bias are conserved but the nucleic acidsequence is changed. Such recoding does not affect the growth of PV unless it destroys thesequence/structure of a functional RNA element. Using genetic analyses and a methodcalled “signal location search;” we detected two unique functionally redundant RNAelements (α and β); each about 75 nt long and separated by 150 nt; in the 3′-terminalcoding sequence of RNA polymerase; 3D pol. The presence of wild type (WT) α or β was …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2012,29
Histidine residue 94 is involved in pH sensing by histidine kinase ArsS of Helicobacter pylori,Stefanie Müller; Monika Götz; Dagmar Beier,Background The ArsRS two-component system is the master regulator of acid adaptation inthe human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori. Low pH is supposed to trigger theautophosphorylation of the histidine kinase ArsS and the subsequent transfer of thephosphoryl group to its cognate response regulator ArsR which then acts as an activator orrepressor of pH-responsive genes. Orthologs of the ArsRS two-component system are alsopresent in H. pylori's close relatives H. hepaticus; Campylobacter jejuni and Wolinellasuccinogenes which are non-gastric colonizers. Methodology/Principal Findings In order toinvestigate the mechanism of acid perception by ArsS; derivatives of H. pylori 26695expressing ArsS proteins with substitutions of the histidine residues present in itsperiplasmic input domain were constructed.

Bacillaene and sporulation protect Bacillus subtilis from predation by Myxococcus xanthus,Susanne Müller; Sarah N Strack; B Christopher Hoefler; Paul D Straight; Daniel B Kearns; John R Kirby,ABSTRACT Myxococcus xanthus and Bacillus subtilis are common soil-dwelling bacteriathat produce a wide range of secondary metabolites and sporulate under nutrient-limitingconditions. Both organisms affect the composition and dynamics of microbial communities inthe soil. However; M. xanthus is known to be a predator; while B. subtilis is not. A screen ofvarious prey led to the finding that M. xanthus is capable of consuming laboratory strains ofB. subtilis; while the ancestral strain; NCIB3610; was resistant to predation. Based in part onrecent characterization of several strains of B. subtilis; we were able to determine that thepks gene cluster; which is required for production of bacillaene; is the major factor allowingB. subtilis NCIB3610 cells to resist predation by M. xanthus. Furthermore; purified bacillaenewas added exogenously to domesticated strains; resulting in resistance to predation …,Applied and environmental microbiology,2014,28

The orphan response regulator HP1021 of Helicobacter pylori regulates transcription of a gene cluster presumably involved in acetone metabolism,Michael Pflock; Melanie Bathon; Jennifer Schär; Stefanie Müller; Hans Mollenkopf; Thomas F Meyer; Dagmar Beier,ABSTRACT Helicobacter pylori is a gastric pathogen for which no nonhuman reservoir isknown. In accordance with the tight adaptation to its unique habitat; the human stomach; H.pylori is endowed with a very restricted repertoire of regulatory proteins. Nevertheless; thethree complete two-component systems of H. pylori were shown to be involved in theregulation of important virulence traits like motility and acid resistance and in the control ofmetal homeostasis. HP1021 is an orphan response regulator with an atypical receiverdomain whose inactivation has a considerable impact on the growth of H. pylori. Here wereport the identification of HP1021-regulated genes by whole-genome transcriptionalprofiling. We show that the transcription of the essential housekeeping genes nifS and nifU;which are required for the assembly of Fe-S clusters; is activated by HP1021.

Large-scale recoding of an arbovirus genome to rebalance its insect versus mammalian preference,Sam H Shen; Charles B Stauft; Oleksandr Gorbatsevych; Yutong Song; Charles B Ward; Alisa Yurovsky; Steffen Mueller; Bruce Futcher; Eckard Wimmer,Abstract The protein synthesis machineries of two distinct phyla of the Animal kingdom;insects of Arthropoda and mammals of Chordata; have different preferences for how to bestencode proteins. Nevertheless; arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses) are capable ofinfecting both mammals and insects just like arboviruses that use insect vectors to infectplants. These organisms have evolved carefully balanced genomes that can efficiently usethe translational machineries of different phyla; even if the phyla belong to differentkingdoms. Using dengue virus as an example; we have undone the genome encodingbalance and specifically shifted the encoding preference away from mammals. Thesemammalian-attenuated viruses grow to high titers in insect cells but low titers in mammaliancells; have dramatically increased LD 50 s in newborn mice; and induce high levels of …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2015,27

Infrared attenuated total reflection (IR‐ATR) spectroscopy for detecting drugs in human saliva,Kerstin M‐C Hans; Susanne Müller; Markus W Sigrist,Abstract The consumption of drugs is of great concern worldwide. Various drug tests forhumans have been developed but there is no compact and easy-to-use test device availableyet for direct semi-quantitative drug testing in the field. We suggest using attenuated totalreflection (ATR) infrared spectroscopy as a sensing method to analyze human salivasamples with respect to drugs. In this paper; we present ATR spectra in the infrared rangebetween 2300 and 900 cm− 1 as a first step towards such a device. We emphasize thecommon drug cocaine and its metabolites and investigate the problems of spectralinterferences of selected diluents; masking agents; common medication; and soft drinks.Furthermore; spectra of saliva samples are recorded and a time-dependent change of thespectral signatures after alcohol consumption is presented.

Specificity residues determine binding affinity for two-component signal transduction systems,Jonathan W Willett; Nitija Tiwari; Susanne Müller; Katherine R Hummels; Jon CD Houtman; Ernesto J Fuentes; John R Kirby,ABSTRACT Two-component systems (TCS) comprise histidine kinases and their cognateresponse regulators and allow bacteria to sense and respond to a wide variety of signals.Histidine kinases (HKs) phosphorylate and dephosphorylate their cognate responseregulators (RRs) in response to stimuli. In general; these reactions appear to be highlyspecific and require an appropriate association between the HK and RR proteins. TheMyxococcus xanthus genome encodes one of the largest repertoires of signaling proteins inbacteria (685 open reading frames [ORFs]); including at least 127 HKs and at least 143 RRs.Of these; 27 are bona fide NtrC-family response regulators; 21 of which are encodedadjacent to their predicted cognate kinases. Using system-wide profiling methods; wedetermined that the HK-NtrC RR pairs display a kinetic preference during both …,MBio,2013,21

In the case of Gram-negative systems; a key step to transformation is the import of DNA across the outermembrane. Although multiple factors are known to affect DNA transport; little is known aboutthe dynamics of DNA import. Here; we characterized the spatio-temporal dynamics of DNAimport into the periplasm of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. DNA was imported into the periplasm atrandom locations around the cell contour. Subsequently; it was recruited at the septum ofdiplococci at a time scale that increased with DNA length. We found using fluorescent DNAthat the periplasm was saturable within minutes with∼ 40 kbp DNA. The DNA-bindingprotein ComE quantitatively governed the carrying capacity of the periplasm in a gene-dosage-dependent fashion.

The CrdRS (HP1365-HP1364) two-component system is not involved in pH-responsive gene regulation in the Helicobacter pylori strains 26695 and G27,Michael Pflock; Stefanie Müller; Dagmar Beier,Abstract The human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori is extremely well adapted to thehighly acidic conditions encountered in the stomach. The pronounced acid resistance of H.pylori relies mainly on the ammonia-producing enzyme urease. However; urease-independent mechanisms are likely to contribute to acid adaptation. pH-responsive generegulation in this organism is mediated by a two-component system (HP0166-HP0165)designated ArsRS and the metal-dependent regulators NikR and Fur. Recently; it wasreported that another two-component system termed CrdRS (HP1365-HP1364) is requiredfor pH-responsive regulation of the major acid-resistance systems in the H. pylori strain J99.By the analysis of crdRS null mutants of the H. pylori strains 26695 and G27; we show thatlow pH induction of both the urease and the amidase genes occurs in the absence of …,Current microbiology,2007,19

Predation by Myxococcus xanthus induces Bacillus subtilis to form spore-filled megastructures,Susanne Müller; Sarah N Strack; Sarah E Ryan; Daniel B Kearns; John R Kirby,ABSTRACT Biofilm formation is a common mechanism for surviving environmental stressand can be triggered by both intraspecies and interspecies interactions. Prolonged predator-prey interactions between the soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus and Bacillus subtilis werefound to induce the formation of a new type of B. subtilis biofilm; termed megastructures.Megastructures are tree-like brachiations that are as large as 500 μm in diameter; are raisedabove the surface between 150 and 200 μm; and are filled with viable endosporesembedded within a dense matrix. Megastructure formation did not depend on TasA; EpsE;SinI; RemA; or surfactin production and thus is genetically distinguishable from colonybiofilm formation on MSgg medium. As B. subtilis endospores are not susceptible topredation by M. xanthus; megastructures appear to provide an alternative mechanism for …,Applied and environmental microbiology,2015,17

Role of IFN-gamma and IL-6 in a protective immune response to Yersinia enterocolitica in mice,Gianluca Matteoli; Edda Fahl; Philipp Warnke; Steffen Müller; Michael Bonin; Ingo B Autenrieth; Erwin Bohn,Yersinia outer protein (Yop) H is a secreted virulence factor of Yersinia enterocolitica (Ye);which inhibits phagocytosis of Ye and contributes to the virulence of Ye in mice. The aim ofthis study was to address whether and how YopH affects the innate immune response to Yein mice. For this purpose; mice were infected with wild type Ye (pYV+) or a YopH-deficientYe mutant strain (ΔyopH). CD11b+ cells were isolated from the infected spleen andsubjected to gene expression analysis using microarrays. Despite the attenuation of ΔyopHin vivo; by variation of infection doses we were able to achieve conditions that allowcomparison of gene expression in pYV+ and ΔyopH infection; using either comparableinfection courses or splenic bacterial burden. Gene expression analysis provided evidencethat expression levels of several immune response genes; including IFN-γ and IL-6; are …,BMC microbiology,2008,15
Effect of fecal water on an in vitro model of colonic mucosal barrier function,Chris IR Gill; Patricia Heavey; Eileen McConville; Ian Bradbury; Caroline Faessler; Susanne Mueller; Alberto Cresci; Joel Dore; Elisabeth Norin; Ian Rowland,Abstract Fecal water (FW) has been shown to exert; in cultured cells; cytotoxic and genotoxiceffects that have implications for colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. We have investigated a furtherbiological activity of FW; namely; the ability to affect gap junctions in CACO2 cell monolayersas an index of mucosal barrier function; which is known to be disrupted in cancer. FWsamples from healthy; free-living; European subjects that were divided into two broad agegroups; adult (40±9.7 yr; n= 53) and elderly (76±7.5 yr; n= 55) were tested for effects on gapjunction using the transepithelial resistance (TER) assay. Overall; treatment of CACO2 cellswith FW samples from adults increased TER (+ 4%); whereas FW from elderly subjectsdecreased TER (− 5%); the difference between the two groups was significant (P< 0.05). Wealso measured several components of FW potentially associated with modulation of TER …,Nutrition and cancer,2007,15
Computationally designed adeno-associated virus (AAV) Rep 78 is efficiently maintained within an adenovirus vector,Varsha Sitaraman; Patrick Hearing; Charles B Ward; Dmitri V Gnatenko; Eckard Wimmer; Steffen Mueller; Steven Skiena; Wadie F Bahou,Abstract Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a single-stranded parvovirus retaining the uniquecapacity for site-specific integration into a transcriptionally silent region of the humangenome; a characteristic requiring the functional properties of the Rep 78/68 polypeptide inconjunction with AAV terminal repeat integrating elements. Previous strategies designed toassemble these genetic elements into adenoviral (Ad) backbones have been limited by thegeneral intolerability of AAV Rep sequences; prompting us to computationally reengineerthe Rep gene by using synonymous codon pair recoding. Rep mutants generated by usingde novo genome synthesis maintained the polypeptide sequence and endonucleaseproperties of Rep 78; while dramatically enhancing Ad replication and viral titer yields;characteristics indistinguishable from adenovirus lacking coexpressed Rep.

A host-specific; temperature-sensitive translation defect determines the attenuation phenotype of a human rhinovirus/poliovirus chimera; PV1 (RIPO),Nusrat Jahan; Eckard Wimmer; Steffen Mueller,ABSTRACT By using a rhinosvirus/poliovirus type 1 chimera; PV1 (RIPO); with the cognateinternal ribosome entry site (IRES) of human rhinovirus type 2 (HRV2); we set out to shedlight on the mechanism by which this variant expresses its attenuated phenotype inpoliovirus-sensitive; CD155 transgenic (tg) mice and cynomolgus monkeys. Here we reportthat replication of PV1 (RIPO) is restricted not only in human cells of neuronal origin; as wasreported previously; but also in cells of murine origin at physiological temperature. Thisblock in replication was enhanced at 39.5 C but; remarkably; it was absent at 33 C. PV1(RIPO) variants that overcame the replication block were derived by serial passage underrestrictive conditions in either mouse cells or human neuronal cells. All adapting mutationsmapped to the 5′-nontranslated region of PV1 (RIPO). Variants selected in mouse cells …,Journal of virology,2011,14

Protein degradation corrects for imbalanced subunit stoichiometry in OST complex assembly,Susanne Mueller; Asa Wahlander; Nathalie Selevsek; Claudia Otto; Elsy Mankah Ngwa; Kristina Poljak; Alexander D Frey; Markus Aebi; Robert Gauss,Abstract Protein degradation is essential for cellular homeostasis. We developed a sensitiveapproach to examining protein degradation rates in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by couplinga SILAC approach to selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry. Combinedwith genetic tools; this analysis made it possible to study the assembly of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex. The ER-associated degradation machinery compensated for disturbedhomeostasis of complex components by degradation of subunits in excess. On a largerscale; protein degradation in the ER was found to be a minor factor in the regulation ofprotein homeostasis in exponentially growing cells; but ERAD became relevant when thegene dosage was affected; as demonstrated in heterozygous diploid cells. Hence thealleviation of fitness defects due to abnormal gene copy numbers might be an important …,Molecular biology of the cell,2015,13

Recoding of the vesicular stomatitis virus L gene by computer-aided design provides a live; attenuated vaccine candidate,Bingyin Wang; Chen Yang; Gergely Tekes; Steffen Mueller; Aniko Paul; Sean PJ Whelan; Eckard Wimmer,ABSTRACT Codon pair bias (CPB); which has been observed in all organisms; is aneglected genomic phenomenon that affects gene expression. CPB results fromsynonymous codons that are paired more or less frequently in ORFeomes regardless ofcodon bias. The effect of an individual codon pair change is usually small; but when it isamplified by large-scale genome recoding; strikingly altered biological phenotypes areobserved. The utility of codon pair bias in the development of live attenuated vaccines wasrecently demonstrated by recodings of poliovirus (a positive-strand RNA virus) and influenzavirus (a negative-strand segmented RNA virus). Here; the L gene of vesicular stomatitis virus(VSV); a nonsegmented negative-sense RNA virus; was partially recoded based on codonpair bias.

An interaction between glutathione and the capsid is required for the morphogenesis of C-cluster enteroviruses,Hsin-Chieh Ma; Ying Liu; Chunling Wang; Michael Strauss; Nina Rehage; Ying-Han Chen; Nihal Altan-Bonnet; James Hogle; Eckard Wimmer; Steffen Mueller; Aniko V Paul; Ping Jiang,Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant cellular thiol playing an essential role in preservinga reduced cellular environment. Cellular GSH levels can be efficiently reduced by the GSHbiosynthesis inhibitor; L-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO). The aim of our study was todetermine the role of GSH in the growth of two C-cluster enteroviruses; poliovirus type 1(PV1) and coxsackievirus A20 (CAV20). Our results show that the growth of both PV1 andCAV20 is strongly inhibited by BSO and can be partially reversed by the addition of GSH.BSO has no effect on viral protein synthesis or RNA replication but it strikingly reduces theaccumulation of 14S pentamers in infected cells. GSH-pull down assays show that GSHdirectly interacts with capsid precursors and mature virus made in the absence of BSOwhereas capsid precursors produced under GSH-depletion do not bind to GSH.

Experimental signatures of the inverted phase in InAs/GaSb coupled quantum wells,Matija Karalic; Susanne Mueller; Christopher Mittag; Kiryl Pakrouski; QuanSheng Wu; Alexey A Soluyanov; Matthias Troyer; Thomas Tschirky; Werner Wegscheider; Klaus Ensslin; Thomas Ihn,Abstract Transport measurements are performed on InAs/GaSb double quantum wells atzero and finite magnetic fields applied parallel and perpendicular to the quantum wells. Weinvestigate a sample in the inverted regime where electrons and holes coexist; and compareit with another sample in the noninverted semiconducting regime. The activated behavior inconjunction with a strong suppression of the resistance peak at the charge neutrality point ina parallel magnetic field attest to the topological hybridization gap between electron andhole bands in the inverted sample. We observe an unconventional Landau level spectrumwith energy gaps modulated by the magnetic field applied perpendicular to the quantumwells. This is caused by a strong spin-orbit interaction provided jointly by the InAs and theGaSb quantum wells.,Physical Review B,2016,10

PTM MarkerFinder; a software tool to detect and validate spectra from peptides carrying post‐translational modifications,Paolo Nanni; Christian Panse; Peter Gehrig; Susanne Mueller; Jonas Grossmann; Ralph Schlapbach,Abstract Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of peptides carrying post-translationalmodifications is challenging due to the instability of some modifications during MS analysis.However; glycopeptides as well as acetylated; methylated and other modified peptidesrelease specific fragment ions during CID (collision-induced dissociation) and HCD (higherenergy collisional dissociation) fragmentation. These fragment ions can be used to validatethe presence of the PTM on the peptide. Here; we present PTM MarkerFinder; a softwaretool that takes advantage of such marker ions. PTM MarkerFinder screens the MS/MSspectra in the output of a database search (ie; Mascot) for marker ions specific for selectedPTMs. Moreover; it reports and annotates the HCD and the corresponding electron transferdissociation (ETD) spectrum (when present); and summarizes information on the type …,Proteomics,2013,10

Polypyrimidine tract binding protein-1 (PTB1) is a determinant of the tissue and host tropism of a human rhinovirus/poliovirus chimera PV1 (RIPO),Nusrat Jahan; Eckard Wimmer; Steffen Mueller,The internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) of picornavirus genomes serves as the nucleationsite of a highly structured ribonucleoprotein complex essential to the binding of the 40Sribosomal subunit and initiation of viral protein translation. The transition from naked RNA toa functional" IRESome" complex are poorly understood; involving the folding of secondaryand tertiary RNA structure; facilitated by a tightly concerted binding of various host cellproteins that are commonly referred to as IRES trans-acting factors (ITAFs). Here we haveinvestigated the influence of one ITAF; the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTB1); onthe tropism of PV1 (RIPO); a chimeric poliovirus in which translation of the polioviruspolyprotein is under the control of a human rhinovirus type 2 (HRV2) IRES element.

Coding biases and viral fitness,Albert Bosch; Steffen Mueller; Rosa M Pintó,Codon usage bias has also been described for DNA and RNA viruses. Among the latter;poliovirus (PV) has selected through a codon bias similar to that of its human host species(“optimized”); while the codon bias of hepatitis A virus (HAV) is very different from that of itshost (“deoptimized”). Picornavirus internal ribosome entry site (IRES) types have probablyevolved by gradual addition of domains and elements that improved their function inribosome recruitment or otherwise conferred regulation to the process of viral proteinsynthesis in a specific cell environment. The highly inefficient IRES combined with the lack ofa mechanism to induce cellular shutoff leads in HAV to an unfair competition for the cellulartranslational machinery. An intriguing connection exists between codon bias; codon pairbias; and dinucleotide bias in mammalian genomes. Viral genomes; especially of RNA …,*,2010,9

8 Chemosensory Signal Transduction Systems in Myxococcus xanthus,John R Kirby; James E Berleman; Susanne Müller; Di Li; Jodie C Scott; Janet M Wilson,The majority of the analyses have focused on two-component signal transduction (TCST)systems; even though these are likely to compose only a fraction of the total systems thathave evolved to translate information derived from the environment. The majority of all workon chemotaxis systems up until the last decade focused on the control of flagellum-basedmotility. Myxococcus xanthus is therefore an ideal organism for analysis of chemosensorysignal transduction systems in bacteria. There are two primary reasons for our investigationinto the role of the Che6 chemosensory system. First; the gene order is consistent with thatfound in other organisms known to utilize TFP-based motility. Second; a mutant allele knownto suppress the csgA mutant developmental defect was mapped to socD (suppressor ofcsgA); which we now know is cotranscribed as part of the che6 operon.

Integration into the phage attachment site; attB; impairs multicellular differentiation in Stigmatella aurantiaca,Susanne Müller; Hui Shen; Diana Hofmann; Hans Ulrich Schairer; John R Kirby,ABSTRACT Stigmatella aurantiaca displays a complex developmental life cycle in responseto starvation conditions that results in the formation of tree-like fruiting bodies capable ofproducing spores. The phage Mx8; first isolated from the close relative Myxococcus xanthus;is unable to infect S. aurantiaca cells and integrate into the genome. However; plasmidscontaining Mx8 fragments encoding the integrase and attP are able to integrate at the attBlocus in the S. aurantiaca genome by site-specific recombination. After recombinationbetween attP and attB; the S. aurantiaca cells were incapable of building normal fruitingbodies but formed clumps and fungus-like structures characteristic of intermediate stages ofdevelopment displayed by the wild type.

A Two‐Hybrid System Analysis Shows Interactions Between 6‐Phosphofructo‐1‐Kinase and 6‐Phosphofructo‐2‐Kinase but not Between Other Glycolytic Enzymes...,Susanne Müller; Eckhard Boles; Friedrich K Zimmermann,Abstract The yeast two-hybrid system was used to investigate whether protein-proteininteractions between enzymes of the early reactions of glycolysis exist in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Various glycolytic enzymes were fused either to the GAL4transcription-activating or DNA-binding domain and were tested for their ability to restoreGAL4-dependent gene activation. All the different fusion proteins complemented the growthand enzymatic defects caused by the deletion of the respective genes; which indicates thatthese proteins are still functional. Interactions between the two phosphofructo-1-kinasesubunits PFK1 and PFK2; interactions between the phosphofructo-2-kinase subunits; anddimerization of phosphoglucose isomerase were demonstrated.

Reply to Simmonds et al.: Codon pair and dinucleotide bias have not been functionally distinguished,Bruce Futcher; Oleksandr Gorbatsevych; Sam H Shen; Charles B Stauft; Yutong Song; Bingyin Wang; Janet Leatherwood; Justin Gardin; Alisa Yurovsky; Steffen Mueller; Eckard Wimmer,Simmonds et al.(1) have criticized our paper (2). Two disagreements stand out. First; theauthors suggest that our viruses are attenuated by increased “dinucleotide frequencies”(1;3); but “codon pair deoptimization” they dismiss as “artefact”(3). We believe this is justsemantic word juggling. When a protein is recoded; UpA/CpG dinucleotides available forchange are largely at codon–codon junctions; where they define codon pairs. In mammals;many disfavored codon pairs have UpA or CpG at their junctions (4). Therefore; alteringUpA/CpG dinucleotides simultaneously alters codon pairs; and vice versa. Accordingly; all ofthe viral constructs in question (1; 2) coordinately alter dinucleotides and codon pairs (seebelow) and so do not distinguish the phenomena. No mechanism is known for eitherphenomenon. Nothing about our results; conclusions; or the future uses of these …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2015,7

These vaccine candidates should have a lowrisk of deattenuation because of the many changes involved. However; their genetic stabilityunder selective pressure is largely unknown. We evaluated phenotypic reversion ofdeoptimized human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine candidates in the context ofstrong selective pressure.

Evaluation of the attenuation; immunogenicity; and efficacy of a live virus vaccine generated by codon-pair bias de-optimization of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenz...,Andrew J Broadbent; Celia P Santos; Amanda Anafu; Eckard Wimmer; Steffen Mueller; Kanta Subbarao,Abstract Codon-pair bias de-optimization (CPBD) of viruses involves re-writing viral genesusing statistically underrepresented codon pairs; without any changes to the amino acidsequence or codon usage. Previously; this technology has been used to attenuate theinfluenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) virus. The de-optimized virus was immunogenic andprotected inbred mice from challenge. In order to assess whether CPBD could be used toproduce a live vaccine against a clinically relevant influenza virus; we generated aninfluenza A/California/07/2009 pandemic H1N1 (2009 pH1N1) virus with de-optimized HAand NA gene segments (2009 pH1N1-(HA+ NA) Min); and evaluated viral replication andprotein expression in MDCK cells; and attenuation; immunogenicity; and efficacy in outbredferrets.

Influence of etching processes on electronic transport in mesoscopic InAs/GaSb quantum well devices,Atindra Nath Pal; Susanne Müller; Thomas Ihn; Klaus Ensslin; Thomas Tschirky; Christophe Charpentier; Werner Wegscheider,We report the electronic characterization of mesoscopic Hall bar devices fabricated fromcoupled InAs/GaSb quantum wells sandwiched between AlSb barriers; an emergingcandidate for two-dimensional topological insulators. The electronic width of the etchedstructures was determined from the low field magneto-resistance peak; a characteristicsignature of partially diffusive boundary scattering in the ballistic limit. In case of dry-etchingthe electronic width was found to decrease with electron density. In contrast; for wet etcheddevices it stayed constant with density. Moreover; the boundary scattering was found to bemore specular for wet-etched devices; which may be relevant for studying topological edgestates.,AIP Advances,2015,6
Effects of protein A immunoadsorption on methylglyoxal levels in patients with chronic dilated cardiomyopathy and diabetes mellitus,AO Doesch; S Mueller; M Konstandin; S Celik; L Frankenstein; C Zugck; TJ Dengler; T Fleming; A Bierhaus; HA Katus,Abstract Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate effects ofimmunoadsorption (IA) on methylglyoxal (MG) levels in patients with chronic non-familialdilated cardiomyopathy (DCM); as well as clinical and humoral markers of heart failure.Background: Previous studies have demonstrated favourable outcomes of IA in DCMpatients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and that MG sensitizes cultured cardiomyocytes to injuryby posttranslational modification of Thioredoxin via glycation. Therapeutic interventionsscavenging advanced glycation end-products (AGE) precursors may attenuate myocardialinjury in diabetic patients.

Material Characterization of Liquid Crystals at THz-Frequencies using a Free Space Measurement Setup,M Koeberle; T Goebel; D Schoenherr; S Mueller; R Jakoby; P Meissner; H-L Hartnagel,Liquid crystals (LCs) are promising materials for passive tunable components at microwavefrequencies and optics. With increasing interest in the THz frequency domain the quest ontunable THz components rises. For the systematic design of such tunable components likephase shifters or reflect arrays a detailed knowledge of the dielectric material properties atthe intended frequency is needed. In this paper we show measurement results for thecharacterization of two commercial LCs (K15 and E7; both from Merck) at frequenciesbetween 100 and 350 GHz performed with a free space CW THz system. An anisotropy ofDeltanK15= 0; 05 and DeltanE7= 0; 08; respectively; could be determined in this frequencyrange.,Microwave Conference (GeMIC); 2008 German,2008,6
Infrared A radiation promotes survival of human melanocytes carrying ultraviolet radiation‐induced DNA damage,Susanne Kimeswenger; Agatha Schwarz; Dagmar Födinger; Susanne Müller; Hubert Pehamberger; Thomas Schwarz; Christian Jantschitsch,Abstract The link between solar radiation and melanoma is still elusive. Although infraredradiation (IR) accounts for over 50% of terrestrial solar energy; its influence on human skin isnot well explored. There is increasing evidence that IR influences the expression patterns ofseveral molecules independently of heat. A previous in vivo study revealed that pretreatmentwith IR might promote the development of UVR-induced non-epithelial skin cancer andpossibly of melanoma in mice. To expand on this; the aim of the present study was toevaluate the impact of IR on UVR-induced apoptosis and DNA repair in normal humanepidermal melanocytes. The balance between these two effects is a key factor of malignanttransformation. Human melanocytes were exposed to physiologic doses of IR and UVR.Compared to cells irradiated with UVR only; simultaneous exposure to IR significantly …,Experimental dermatology,2016,5

Direct simulation of material permittivities by using an eigen-susceptibility formulation of the vector variational approach,Alexander Gaebler; Felix Goelden; Stefan Mueller; Andreas Penirschke; Rolf Jakoby,This paper presents a new method for the extraction of material parameters; in this case thepermittivity; by formulating the Maxwell equations as an eigen-susceptibility problem of theconsidered sample. This offers a direct solution of the desired material parameters byutilizing adequate and well proven numerical techniques. Hence; it is very useful if analyticalapproaches do not provide the aimed accuracy or even fail completely. The procedure willbe demonstrated by applying the variational approach to a triple mode cavity perturbationmethod for the characterization of the complex permittivity tensor of general biaxialanisotropic media.,Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference; 2009.

Scattering mechanisms of highest-mobility InAs/Al x Ga 1− x Sb quantum wells,Thomas Tschirky; Susanne Mueller; Ch A Lehner; Stefan Fält; Thomas Ihn; Klaus Ensslin; Werner Wegscheider,Abstract We study molecular beam epitaxially grown undoped Al x Ga 1− x Sb/InAs/AlSbquantum wells with different buffer and barrier designs and varying quantum well width. Thehighest mobilities were achieved with Al 0.33 Ga 0.67 Sb buffers and lower barriers and aquantum well width of 24 nm. These quasi-single-interface InAs/AlSb quantum well devicesreached a gate-tuned mobility of 2.4× 10 6 cm 2/V s at a density of 1× 10 12 cm− 2 and 1.3K. In Hall bar devices boundary scattering is found to strongly influence the mobilitydetermination in this mobility regime. Ionized background impurity scattering at low electrondensities; device boundary scattering at intermediate electron densities; and intersubbandscattering at high electron densities were identified as the most likely dominant scatteringprocesses.

Pathways of protein and lipid receptor-mediated transcytosis in drug delivery,Roland Thuenauer; Stefan K Müller; Winfried Römer,ABSTRACT Introduction: A critical factor for the efficacy of drugs is their availability at the siteof interest. However; crossing endothelial and epithelial cell layers like the blood-brainbarrier and the blood-intestinal barrier represents a major bottleneck for drug targeting.Coupling drugs to carriers that recognize endogenous receptors; which are then transportedthrough cell layers by transcytosis; is a promising approach to overcome this bottleneck.Areas covered: This review focuses on the intracellular pathways of receptor-mediatedtranscytosis and their applicability for transcellular drug delivery. It gives an overview abouttranscytotic trafficking routes in epithelia and highlights the well-studied examples ofimmungobulin transcytosis and transferrin transcytosis. The current knowledge about theless understood transcytosis pathways in endothelia is also summarized and low-density …,*,2017,4
Tunnel barrier design in donor nanostructures defined by hydrogen-resist lithography,Nikola Pascher; Szymon Hennel; Susanne Mueller; Andreas Fuhrer,Abstract A four-terminal donor quantum dot (QD) is used to characterize potential barriersbetween degenerately doped nanoscale contacts. The QD is fabricated by hydrogen-resistlithography on Si (001) in combination with n-type doping by phosphine. The four contactshave different separations (d= 9; 12; 16 and 29 nm) to the central 6 nm× 6 nm QD island;leading to different tunnel and capacitive coupling. Cryogenic transport measurements in theCoulomb-blockade (CB) regime are used to characterize these tunnel barriers. We find thatfield enhancement near the apex of narrow dopant leads is an important effect thatinfluences both barrier breakdown and the magnitude of the tunnel current in the CBtransport regime. From CB-spectroscopy measurements; we extract the mutual capacitancesbetween the QD and the four contacts; which scale inversely with the contact separation d …,New Journal of Physics,2016,4

Inhibition of hepatitis C virus IRES-mediated translation by oligonucleotides,Xiaoyu Li; Steffen Mueller; Eckard Wimmer,Abstract Two oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) were found to have a strong inhibition on thehepatitis C virus (HCV) internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES)-mediated translation but not therabbit globin mRNA translation. Specific inhibition of those ODNs on HCV IRES-mediatedtranslation was confirmed with heat treatment of ODNs in formic acid and dosage-dependentmanners. Heat treatment of ODNs presented a decreasing inhibitory effect on HCV IRES-mediated translation. A dosage-dependent decrease of HCV IRES-mediated translation wasobserved with increasing amount of these ODNs in HeLa cell extracts. The minimalsequences of ODNs (A11) were identified as 5′-CGCGTTACG-3′ with the strongestinhibition of the HCV IRES-mediated translation. In a search for cellular factors; two cellularfactors (p68 and p70) were identified to interact with ODNs A1 and A11; but not A5 (CT …,Virus research,2009,4

We explore theproblem of designing the provably shortest genomic sequence to encode a given set ofgenes by exploiting alternate reading frames. We present an algorithm for designing theshortest DNA sequence simultaneously encoding two given amino acid sequences. Weshow that the coding sequence of naturally occurring pairs of overlapping genes approachmaximum compression. We also investigate the impact of alternate coding matrices onoverlapping sequence design. Finally; we discuss an interesting application for overlappinggene design; namely the interleaving of an antibiotic resistance gene into a target geneinserted into a virus or plasmid for amplification.,International Workshop on DNA-Based Computers,2005,4

Impact of strain on the electronic properties of InAs/GaSb quantum well systems,Lars Tiemann; Susanne Mueller; Q-S Wu; Thomas Tschirky; Klaus Ensslin; Werner Wegscheider; Matthias Troyer; Alexey A Soluyanov; Thomas Ihn,Abstract Electron-hole hybridization in InAs/GaSb double quantum well structures leads tothe formation of a mini-band-gap. We experimentally and theoretically studied the impact ofstrain on the transport properties of this material system. Thinned samples were mounted topiezoelectric elements to exert strain along the [011] and [001] crystal directions. When theFermi energy is tuned through the minigap; the resistivity at the charge neutrality point isfound to be susceptible to external strain. In the electron and hole regimes; strain influencesthe Landau level structure. By analyzing the intrinsic strain from the epitaxial growth and theexternal strain from the piezo elements and combining our experimental results withnumerical simulations of strained and unstrained quantum wells; we can illustrate why theInAs/GaSb material system is regularly found to be semimetallic.,Physical Review B,2017,3

Our goal was to investigatelectins recognizing the glycosphingolipid globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) for their potential ascarriers for transcytotic drug delivery. Methods: We utilized an in vitro model based on Madin-Darby canine kidney cells transfected with Gb3 synthase to characterize transcytosis of theGb3-binding lectins LecA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the B-subunit of Shiga toxin(StxB). Results: Both lectins were rapidly transcytosed from the apical to the basolateralplasma membrane and vice versa. Whereas StxB proceeded on retrograde and transcytoticroutes; LecA avoided retrograde transport. This differential trafficking could be explained byour observation that LecA and StxB segregated into different domains during endocytosis …,Expert opinion on drug delivery,2017,3

Repeated sequence motifs in the Helicobacter pylori P1408 promoter do not affect its transcription,Stefanie Müller; Johanna Förster; Dagmar Beier,Summary The ArsRS two-component system controls the pH-dependent transcription ofseveral target genes involved in the acid resistance of Helicobacter pylori. In itsphosphorylated form the response regulator ArsR activates transcription of the urease genesand it has been reported that ArsR∼ P binds to a 26 bp consensus motif which is present inthe promoter regions of the ORFs hp1408; hp119 and hp1432 encoding proteins ofunknown function. Here we show that the upstream region of ORF hp1408 exhibitsconsiderable sequence variation in different isolates of H. pylori. By the construction offusions of the P 1408 promoter from different H. pylori strains to the reporter gene gfp in thegenetic background of H. pylori G27 we demonstrate that these sequence variations do notsignificantly affect acid-induced transcription. Furthermore; we show that a P 1408 core …,Microbiological research,2006,2

Dilated cardiomyopathy--heart muscle disease of unknown origin or an autoimmune disease? New aspects of etiology; pathogenesis and clinical practice,S Müller,Abstract Recent evidence suggests that the most common form of idiopathic cardiomyopathyin our altitudes; the dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM); is a post-infectious autoimmune diseasewhich is triggered by virus infections. In animal experiments; the development of thecoxsackie virus B3 myocarditis to a congestive cardiac insufficiency resembling the clinicalpicture of DCM was demonstrated. In mice; species-dependent varying disease coursescould be observed; which point to a genetically different behaviour of the animals'immunological reactions; either humoral or T-cell mediated immune reactions beingresponsible.

Differential induction of ATF3 and HO-1 in myeloid cells and keratinocytes via Dimethylfumarate or Cyclosporine A,Stefanie Müller; Nikola Smatlik; Marc Burian; Kamran Ghoreschi; Martin Röcken; Amir S Yazdi,Abstract Background Chronic inflammatory skin diseases are characterized by controlledproliferation of keratinocytes. Here; activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) might play afundamental role. In these inflammatory diseases; proliferation is controlled and only rarelyleads to cancer development which can be supported by an inflammatory microenvironment.ATF3 is a dual function protein as it suppresses pro-inflammatory IL-6 and IL-8; but also actsas a pro-oncogenic factor by the suppression of p53. We therefore analyzed ATF3expression comparing myeloid cells with keratinocytes. Objective To dissect the bi-modalrole of ATF3 we pharmacologically induced ATF3 and analyzed its influence on cytokineexpression and secretion in a cell type specific manner.

Passivation of edge states in etched InAs sidewalls,Christopher Mittag; Matija Karalic; Susanne Mueller; Thomas Tschirky; Werner Wegscheider; Olga Nazarenko; Maksym V Kovalenko; Thomas Ihn; Klaus Ensslin,We investigate different methods of passivating sidewalls of wet etched InAsheterostructures in order to suppress inherent edge conduction that is presumed to occurdue to band bending at the surface; leading to charge carrier accumulation. Passivationtechniques including sulfur; positively charged compensation dopants; and plasmaenhanced chemical vapor deposition of SiNx do not show an improvement. Surprisingly;atomic layer deposition of Al2O3 leads to an increase in the edge resistivity of more than anorder of magnitude.

Edge transport in InAs and InAs/GaSb quantum wells,Susanne Mueller; Christopher Mittag; Thomas Tschirky; Christophe Charpentier; Werner Wegscheider; Klaus Ensslin; Thomas Ihn,Abstract We investigate low-temperature transport through single InAs quantum wells andbroken-gap InAs/GaSb double quantum wells. Nonlocal measurements in the regimebeyond bulk pinch-off confirm the presence of edge conduction in InAs quantum wells. Theedge resistivity of 1–2 k Ω/μ m is of the same order of magnitude as edge resistivitiesmeasured in the InAs/GaSb double quantum well system. Measurements in a tilted magneticfield suggests an anisotropy of the conducting regions at the edges with a larger extent inthe plane of the sample than normal to it.

F-pure threshold and height of quasi-homogeneous polynomials,Susanne Müller,Abstract: We consider a quasi-homogeneous polynomial $ f\in\mathbb {Z}[x_0;\ldots; x_N] $of degree $ w $ equal to the degree of $ x_0\cdots x_N $ and show that the $ F $-purethreshold of the reduction $ f_p\in\mathbb {F} _p [x_0;\ldots; x_N] $ is equal to the logcanonical threshold if and only if the height of the Artin-Mazur formal group associated to $H^{N-1}\left (X;{\mathbb {G}} _ {m; X}\right) $; where $ X $ is the hypersurface given by $ f $;is equal to 1. We also prove that a similar result holds for Fermat hypersurfaces of degree $>N+ 1$. Furthermore; we give examples of weighted Delsarte surfaces which show that othervalues of the $ F $-pure threshold of a quasi-homogeneous polynomial of degree $ w $cannot be characterized by the height.

Molecular dynamics simulation of polymerlike thin films irradiated by fast ions: A comparison between FENE and Lennard-Jones potentials,NW Lima; LI Gutierres; RI Gonzalez; S Müller; RS Thomaz; EM Bringa; RM Papaléo,Abstract In this paper; the surface effects of individual heavy ions impacting thin polymerlikefilms were investigated; using molecular dynamics simulations with the finite extensiblenonlinear elastic (FENE) potential to describe the molecular chains. The perturbationintroduced by the ions in the lattice was modeled assuming that the initial excitation energyin the ion track is converted into an effective temperature; as in a thermal spike. The trackwas heated only within the film thickness h; leaving a nonexcited substrate below. The effectof decreasing thickness on cratering and sputtering was evaluated. The results werecompared to experimental data of thin polymer films bombarded by MeV–GeV ions and tosimulations performed with the Lennard-Jones potential. While several qualitative resultsobserved in the experiments were also seen in the simulations; irrespective of the …,Physical Review B,2016,1
Experimental evidence for the topological insulator phase in InAs/GaSb coupled quantum wells,Matija Karalic; Susanne Mueller; Christopher Mittag; Kiryl Pakrouski; QuanSheng Wu; Alexey A Soluyanov; Matthias Troyer; Thomas Tschirky; Werner Wegscheider; Klaus Ensslin; Thomas Ihn,Abstract: Transport measurements are performed on InAs/GaSb double quantum wells atzero and finite magnetic fields applied parallel and perpendicular to the quantum wells. Weinvestigate a sample in the inverted regime where electrons and holes coexist; and compareit with another sample in the non-inverted semiconducting regime. Activated behavior inconjunction with a strong suppression of the resistance peak at the charge neutrality point ina parallel magnetic field attest to the topological hybridization gap between electron andhole bands in the inverted sample. We observe an unconventional Landau level spectrumwith energy gaps modulated by the magnetic field applied perpendicular to the quantumwells. This is caused by strong spin-orbit interaction provided jointly by the InAs and theGaSb quantum wells.

The role of T cell costimulation via DNAM-1 in kidney transplantation,Anna K Kraus; Jin Chen; Ilka Edenhofer; Inga Ravens; Ariana Gaspert; Pietro E Cippà; Steffen Mueller; Rudolf P Wuthrich; Stephan Segerer; Guenter Bernhardt; Thomas Fehr,DNAX accessory protein-1 (DNAM-1; CD226) is a co-stimulatory and adhesion moleculeexpressed mainly by natural killer cells and T cells. DNAM-1 and its two ligands CD112 andCD155 are important in graft-versus-host disease; but their role in solid organtransplantation is largely unknown. We investigated the relevance of this pathway in amouse kidney transplantation model. CD112 and CD155 are constitutively expressed onrenal tubular cells and strongly upregulated in acutely rejected renal allografts. In vitroDNAM-1 blockade during allogeneic priming reduced the allospecific T cell response but notthe allospecific cytotoxicity against renal tubular epithelial cells. Accordingly; absence ofDNAM-1 in recipient mice or absence of CD112 or CD155 in the kidney allograft did notsignificantly influence renal function and severity of rejection after transplantation; but led …,PloS one,2016,1

Two proteins for the price of one: the design of maximally compressed coding sequences,Bei Wang; Dimitris Papamichail; Steffen Mueller; Steven Skiena,Abstract The emerging field of synthetic biology moves beyond conventional geneticmanipulation to construct novel life forms which do not originate in nature. We explore theproblem of designing the provably shortest genomic sequence to encode a given set ofgenes by exploiting alternate reading frames. We present an algorithm for designing theshortest DNA sequence simultaneously encoding two given amino acid sequences. Weshow that the coding sequence of naturally occurring pairs of overlapping genes approachmaximum compression. We also investigate the impact of alternate coding matrices onoverlapping sequence design.

Vaccination of pigs with a codon-pair bias de-optimized live attenuated influenza vaccine protects from homologous challenge,Bryan S Kaplan; Carine K Souza; Phillip C Gauger; Charles B Stauft; J Robert Coleman; Steffen Mueller; Amy L Vincent,Abstract Influenza A virus (IAV) in swine constitutes a major economic burden for producersas well as a potential threat to public health. Whole inactivated virus vaccines (WIV) are thepredominant countermeasure employed to control IAV in swine herds in the United Statesdespite the superior protection; and diminished adverse effects; induced by live attenuatedinfluenza vaccines (LAIV).

The so-called kick-and-kill paradigm proposes to purge these reservoirs bycombining latency-reversing agents with immune effectors such as cytotoxic T lymphocytes.Support for this approach is largely based on success in latency models; which do not fullyreflect the makeup of latent reservoirs in individuals on long-term antiretroviral therapy(ART). Recent studies have shown that CD8+ T cells have the potential to recognizedefective proviruses; which comprise the vast majority of all infected cells; and that theproviral landscape can be shaped over time due to in vivo clonal expansion of infectedCD4+ T cells. Here; we have shown that treating CD4+ T cells from ART-treated individualswith combinations of potent latency-reversing agents and autologous CD8+ T cells …,The Journal of Clinical Investigation,2018,*
Ancient Regulatory Role of Lysine Acetylation in Central Metabolism,Ernesto S Nakayasu; Meagan C Burnet; Hanna E Walukiewicz; Christopher S Wilkins; Anil K Shukla; Shelby Brooks; Matthew J Plutz; Brady D Lee; Birgit Schilling; Alan J Wolfe; Susanne Müller; John R Kirby; Christopher V Rao; John R Cort; Samuel H Payne,ABSTRACT Lysine acetylation is a common protein post-translational modification inbacteria and eukaryotes. Unlike phosphorylation; whose functional role in signaling hasbeen established; it is unclear what regulatory mechanism acetylation plays and whether itis conserved across evolution. By performing a proteomic analysis of 48 phylogeneticallydistant bacteria; we discovered conserved acetylation sites on catalytically essential lysineresidues that are invariant throughout evolution. Lysine acetylation removes the residue'scharge and changes the shape of the pocket required for substrate or cofactor binding. Two-thirds of glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes are acetylated at these criticalsites. Our data suggest that acetylation may play a direct role in metabolic regulation byswitching off enzyme activity. We propose that protein acetylation is an ancient and …,mBio,2017,*

Segmented reflectors fulfill these needs using mass produced and lightweight mirror facets. However; as the overall image is the sum of the individual mirror facetimages; alignment is important. Here we present a method to determine the mirror facetpositions on a segmented reflector in a very direct way. Our method reconstructs the mirrorfacet positions from photographs and a laser distance meter measurement which goes fromthe center of the image sensor plane to the center of each mirror facet. We use our method toboth align the mirror facet positions and to feed the measured positions into our IACTsimulation.

Type IV‐pili dependent motility is co‐regulated by PilSR and PilS2R2 two‐component systems via distinct pathways in Myxococcus xanthus,Daniel J Bretl; Susanne Müller; Kayla M Ladd; Samantha N Atkinson; John R Kirby,Summary Myxococcus xanthus is an environmental bacterium with two forms of motility. Onetype; known as social motility; is dependent on extension and retraction of Type-IV pili (T4P)and production of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS). Several signaling systems havebeen linked to regulation of T4P-dependent motility. In particular; expression of the pilinsubunit pilA requires the PilSR two-component signaling system (TCS). A second TCS;PilS2R2; encoded within the same locus that encodes PilSR; has also been linked to M.xanthus T4P-dependent motility. We demonstrate that PilSR and PilS2R2 regulate M.xanthus T4P-dependent motility through distinct pathways. Consistent with known roles ofPilSR; our results indicate that the primary function of PilSR is to regulate expression of pilA.In contrast; PilS2 and PilR2 have little to no affect on PilA protein levels.

Inactivation of Stigmatella aurantiaca CsgA gene impares rippling formation,Ana Milosevic-Đeric; Susanne Müller; Urlich Hans Schairer,Stigmatella aurantiaca fruiting body development depends on cell-cell interactions. One typeof the signaling molecule stigmolone isolated from S. aurantiaca cells acts to help cells tostay together in the aggregation phase. Another gene product involved in intercellularsignaling in S. aurantiaca is the csgA homolog of Myxococcus xanthus. In close relative M.xanthus C signal the product of the csgA gene is required for rippling; aggregation andsporulation. Isolation of homologous gene in S. aurantiaca implicates a probable role ofCsgA in intercellular communication. Inactivation of the gene by insertion mutagenesiscaused alterations in S. aurantiaca fruiting. The motility behavior of the cells duringdevelopment was changed as well as their ability to stay more closely together in the earlystages of development. Inactivation of the csgA gene completely abolished rippling of the …,Genetika,2015,*
New polypyridine anchoring ligands for coordination complexes and surface functionalization,Steffen Müller,This PhD thesis focuses on the synthesis of new polypyridine anchoring ligands and severaldfferent applications. The ligands consist of a coordinating part; a flexible linker and ananchoring group. Due to the fact that different anchoring groups were used; the ligands canbe applied for several types of surface-materials. Using these anchoring ligands; severalcoordination complexes were synthesized. Ruthenium-based complexes; bearing an ion-sensitive ligand; were tested towards their sensing properties. The photophysical propertiesof luminescent Ir (III)-complexes were investigated and compared to related compounds.Furthermore; different types of materials were functionalized with the coordinating anchoringligands and characterized.

The impact of continuous erythropoietin receptor activators in patients after heart transplantation with multifactorial anemia with chronic kidney disease,Susanne Mueller; Ibrahim Gueler; Matthias Helmschrott; Christian A Gleissner; Mohammadreza Akhavanpoor; Lutz Frankenstein; Bastian Schmack; Arjang Ruhparwar; Philipp Ehlermann; Christian Erbel; Tom Bruckner; Hugo A Katus; Andreas O Doesch,Abstract Background: Multifactorial anemia with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a commonproblem after heart transplantation (HTX). Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) arecommonly used to improve hemoglobin levels in patients with anemia due to CKD. WithCERA (Continuous Erythropoietin Receptor Activator) a new therapeutic agent with a longerserum half time is available. However; data in patients after HTX are extremely limited. Thisstudy retrospectively evaluated the effects of anemia treatment with CERA versusconventional ESAs (Erythropoietin beta) in patients after HTX with anemia due to CKD.Additional emphasis was put on patients' preference and adherence. Patients and methods:A total of 20 ESA naive heart transplant recipients with anemia due to CKD were includedand analyzed retrospectively.

Protein degradation in saccharomyces cerevisiae: studiying connections between degradation; N-glycosylation and protein complexes using mass spectrometric tools,Susanne Leslie Mueller,Summary Protein degradation is crucial for many cellular processes; eg signal transduction;cell cycle regulation; and cell differentiation. Consequently; it fulfills several tasks: Iteliminates misfolded proteins; regulates amounts of cell cycle proteins; and might evenensure correct ratios for the subunits of multi-protein complexes. The aim of this thesis wasto analyze protein degradation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its connection to severalcellular processes; such as asparagine-linked glycosylation (N-glycosylation) and proteincomplex assembly. To this end we developed and used mass spectrometric methods. Thefirst chapter gives an overview of protein degradation in the yeast endoplasmic reticulum(ER). This process is termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and eliminates misfolded;mutated; and unassembled proteins from the ER. It is part of the stress response that …,*,2014,*

Although latent infection of long-lived CD4+ T cells contributes toviral persistence; the finding of low-level replication in elite controllers suggests a moreactive sanctuary where productively infected cells are shielded from immune destruction.Methods: We used flow cytometric cell sorting to isolate cell populations from lymph nodes(LN) obtained from rhesus macaques (RM) with chronic SIVmac239/251 infection andvarying SIV replication set-points; ranging from progressive infection to elite control. Inselected RM; LN biopsies were obtained before and after in vivo CD8+ cell depletion withmonoclonal antibody M-T807R1.

INAUGURAL ARTICLE by a Recently Elected Academy Member: Identification of two functionally redundant RNA elements in the coding sequence of poliovirus usin...,Yutong Song; Ying Liu; Charles B Ward; Steffen Mueller; Bruce Futcher; Steven Skiena; Aniko V Paul; Eckard Wimmer,Abstract Genomes of RNA viruses contain multiple functional RNA elements required fortranslation or RNA replication. We use unique approaches to identify functional RNAelements in the coding sequence of poliovirus (PV); a plus strand RNA virus. The generalmethod is to recode large segments of the genome using synonymous codons; such thatprotein sequences; codon use; and codon pair bias are conserved but the nucleic acidsequence is changed. Such recoding does not affect the growth of PV unless it destroys thesequence/structure of a functional RNA element. Using genetic analyses and a methodcalled “signal location search;” we detected two unique functionally redundant RNAelements (α and β); each about 75 nt long and separated by 150 nt; in the 3′-terminalcoding sequence of RNA polymerase; 3D pol.

Photoinduced modification of surface states in nanoporous InP observed by terahertz spectroscopy,James Lloyd-Hughes; Susanne Mueller; Giacomo Scalari; Hugh Bishop; Alison Crossley; Mihai Enachi; Lilian Sirbu; Ion Tiginyanu,Abstract A precise control of the surface properties of semiconductor nanomaterials is vitalfor their functionality and use in many opto-electronic applications. Terahertz time-domainspectroscopy allows the non-contact investigation of electron transport in semiconductornanomaterials; without the complication of contact fabrication. The technique allows thephotoconductivity to be determined on picosecond timescales; under the assumption thatthe material's properties are not permanently altered by photoexcitation. Here wedemonstrate that this assumption is not always valid. We report an investigation ofnanoporous honeycombs of n-type InP using terahertz time-domain and X-rayphotoemission spectroscopies. After photoexcitation the dark conductivity was found toincrease quasi-irreversibly; recovering only after several hours in air. The calculated …,APS Meeting Abstracts,2012,*
Introducing Recombinant Picornaviral Genomes into Cells,Steffen Mueller; Eckard Wimmer,DISCUSSION The genome of the picornaviruses; as exemplified by their most notablegenera—enterovirus and rhinovirus—consists of one single-stranded; positive-sense RNAmolecule of~ 7500 nucleotides (nt)(Fig. 1 A). On entry into the host cell's cytoplasm; thegenomic RNA serves as an mRNA that encodes a single viral polyprotein of about 2200amino acids. In a cascade of concerted autocatalytic cleavage events catalyzed by the virus-encoded proteinase moieties 2A pro; 3CD pro; and 3C pro; the polyprotein yields the set offunctional viral proteins necessary for viral proliferation. Instead of the typical m7G cap ofeukaryotic mRNAs; the 5'terminus of the genomic virion RNA is linked to a small; terminal;virus-encoded protein; VPg. The first~ 100 nt form a secondary structure crucial for genomereplication; which; in rhinovirus and enterovirus; is termed the cloverleaf due to its …,Cold Spring Harbor Protocols,2011,*

Analysis of protein degradation in yeast dissects events during complex assembly of oligosaccharyl transferase,Susanne Mueller; Asa Wahlander; Nathalie Selevsek; Claudia Otto; Elsy Mankah Ngwa; Kristina Poljak; Alexander D Frey; Markus Aebi; Robert Gauss,Summary Protein degradation is an essential factor for cellular homeostasis. We developeda sensitive method to examine protein degradation rates in Saccharomyces cerevisiae bycoupling a pulsed-SILAC approach to selected reaction monitoring (SRM) massspectrometry. For most proteins we found low degradation levels in exponential-phase wildtype cells. The majority of proteins were stable and were turned over by cell division ratherthan degradation. However; in cells where subunits of the oligosaccharyl transferase (OST)complex were overexpressed or deleted; components present in excess over their bindingpartners were degraded. This altered subunit stability allowed us to develop a model forOST complex assembly. On a global scale; protein degradation in the ER is relevant whengene dosage is altered; as demonstrated further by degradation of subunits in …,ETH Library,*,*
