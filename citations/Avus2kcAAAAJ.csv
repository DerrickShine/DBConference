Querying and mining of time series data: experimental comparison of representations and distance measures,Hui Ding; Goce Trajcevski; Peter Scheuermann; Xiaoyue Wang; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract The last decade has witnessed a tremendous growths of interests in applicationsthat deal with querying and mining of time series data. Numerous representation methodsfor dimensionality reduction and similarity measures geared towards time series have beenintroduced. Each individual work introducing a particular method has made specific claimsand; aside from the occasional theoretical justifications; provided quantitative experimentalobservations. However; for the most part; the comparative aspects of these experimentswere too narrowly focused on demonstrating the benefits of the proposed methods oversome of the previously introduced ones.

Managing uncertainty in moving objects databases,Goce Trajcevski; Ouri Wolfson; Klaus Hinrichs; Sam Chamberlain,Abstract This article addresses the problem of managing Moving Objects Databases (MODs)which capture the inherent imprecision of the information about the moving object's locationat a given time. We deal systematically with the issues of constructing and representing thetrajectories of moving objects and querying the MOD. We propose to model an uncertaintrajectory as a three-dimensional (3D) cylindrical body and we introduce a set of novel butnatural spatio-temporal operators which capture the uncertainty and are used to expressspatio-temporal range queries. We devise and analyze algorithms for processing theoperators and demonstrate that the model incorporates the uncertainty in a manner whichenables efficient querying; thus striking a balance between the modeling power andcomputational efficiency. We address some implementation aspects which we …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2004,506
Experimental comparison of representation methods and distance measures for time series data,Xiaoyue Wang; Abdullah Mueen; Hui Ding; Goce Trajcevski; Peter Scheuermann; Eamonn Keogh,Abstract The previous decade has brought a remarkable increase of the interest inapplications that deal with querying and mining of time series data. Many of the researchefforts in this context have focused on introducing new representation methods fordimensionality reduction or novel similarity measures for the underlying data. In the vastmajority of cases; each individual work introducing a particular method has made specificclaims and; aside from the occasional theoretical justifications; provided quantitativeexperimental observations.

Spatio-temporal data reduction with deterministic error bounds,Hu Cao; Ouri Wolfson; Goce Trajcevski,Abstract A common way of storing spatio-temporal information about mobile devices is in theform of a 3D (2D geography+ time) trajectory. We argue that when cellular phones andPersonal Digital Assistants become location-aware; the size of the spatio-temporalinformation generated may prohibit efficient processing. We propose to adopt a techniquestudied in computer graphics; namely line-simplification; as an approximation technique tosolve this problem. Line simplification will reduce the size of the trajectories. Linesimplification uses a distance function in producing the trajectory approximation. Wepostulate the desiderata for such a distance-function: it should be sound; namely the error ofthe answers to spatio-temporal queries must be bounded. We analyze several distancefunctions; and prove that some are sound in this sense for some types of queries; while …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2006,268
Finding frequent items in probabilistic data,Qin Zhang; Feifei Li; Ke Yi,Abstract Computing statistical information on probabilistic data has attracted a lot of attentionrecently; as the data generated from a wide range of data sources are inherently fuzzy oruncertain. In this paper; we study an important statistical query on probabilistic data: findingthe frequent items. One straightforward approach to identify the frequent items in aprobabilistic data set is to simply compute the expected frequency of an item and decide if itexceeds a certain fraction of the expected size of the whole data set. However; this simpledefinition misses important information about the internal structure of the probabilistic dataand the interplay among all the uncertain entities. Thus; we propose a new definition basedon the possible world semantics that has been widely adopted for many query types inuncertain data management; trying to find all the items that are likely to be frequent in a …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,218

Weaddress the issue of modeling; constructing; and querying a trajectories database. Wepropose to model a trajectory as a 3D cylindrical body. The model incorporates uncertaintyin a manner that enables efficient querying. Thus our model strikes a balance betweenmodeling power; and computational efficiency. To demonstrate efficiency; we report onexperimental results that relate the length of a trajectory to its size in bytes. The experimentswere conducted using a real map of the Chicago Metropolitan area. We introduce a set ofnovel but natural spatio-temporal operators which capture uncertainty; and are used toexpress spatio-temporal range queries.

Probabilistic range queries in moving objects databases with uncertainty,Goce Trajcevski,Abstract This work addresses the issue of answering spatio-temporal range queries whenthere is uncertainty associated with the model of the moving objects. Uncertainty is inherentin Moving Objects Database (MOD) applications and capturing it in the data model has atwofold impact:--the number of updates when the actual trajectory deviates from its MODrepresentation;--the linguistic constructs and the processing algorithms for querying theMOD. The paper presents both spatial and temporal uncertainty aspects; which arecombined into one model of uncertain trajectories. Given the model; the methodology ispresented which enables processing of queries such as:" What is the probability that a givenmoving object was/will be inside a given< u> region</u>< u> sometimes/always</u> duringa given< u> time</u> interval?" where the regions are bounded by arbitrary 2D polygons.,Proceedings of the 3rd ACM international workshop on Data engineering for wireless and mobile access,2003,116
Efficient maintenance of continuous queries for trajectories,Hui Ding; Goce Trajcevski; Peter Scheuermann,Abstract We address the problem of optimizing the maintenance of continuous queries inMoving Objects Databases; when a set of pending continuous queries need to bereevaluated as a result of bulk updates to the trajectories of moving objects. Such bulkupdates may happen when traffic abnormalities; eg; accidents or road works; affect a subsetof trajectories in the corresponding regions; throughout the duration of these abnormalities.The updates to the trajectories may in turn affect the correctness of the answer sets for thepending continuous queries in much larger geographic areas. We present a comprehensiveset of techniques; both static and dynamic; for improving the performance of reevaluating thecontinuous queries in response to the bulk updates. The static techniques correspond tospecifying the values for the various semantic dimensions of trigger execution. The …,GeoInformatica,2008,103
Continuous probabilistic nearest-neighbor queries for uncertain trajectories,Goce Trajcevski; Roberto Tamassia; Hui Ding; Peter Scheuermann; Isabel F Cruz,Abstract This work addresses the problem of processing continuous nearest neighbor (NN)queries for moving objects trajectories when the exact position of a given object at aparticular time instant is not known; but is bounded by an uncertainty region. As has alreadybeen observed in the literature; the answers to continuous NN-queries in spatio-temporalsettings are time parameterized in the sense that the objects in the answer vary over time.Incorporating uncertainty in the model yields additional attributes that affect the semantics ofthe answer to this type of queries. In this work; we formalize the impact of uncertainty on theanswers to the continuous probabilistic NN-queries; provide a compact structure for theirrepresentation and efficient algorithms for constructing that structure. We also identifysyntactic constructs for several qualitative variants of continuous probabilistic NN-queries …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,88
Evolving triggers for dynamic environments,Goce Trajcevski; Peter Scheuermann; Oliviu Ghica; Annika Hinze; Agnes Voisard,Abstract In this work we address the problem of managing the reactive behavior indistributed environments in which data continuously changes over time; where the usersmay need to explicitly express how the triggers should be (self) modified. To enable this wepropose the (ECA) 2–E volving and C ontext-A ware E vent-C ondition-A ction paradigm forspecifying triggers that capture the desired reactive behavior in databases which managedistributed and continuously changing data. Since both the monitored event and thecondition part of the trigger may be continuous in nature; we introduce the concept ofmetatriggers to coordinate the detection of events and the evaluation of conditions.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,88
Probabilistic range queries for uncertain trajectories on road networks,Kai Zheng; Goce Trajcevski; Xiaofang Zhou; Peter Scheuermann,Abstract Trajectories representing the motion of moving objects are typically obtained vialocation sampling; eg using GPS or road-side sensors; at discrete time-instants. In-betweenconsecutive samples; nothing is known about the whereabouts of a given moving object.Various models have been proposed (eg; sheared cylinders; spacetime prisms) to representthe uncertainty of the moving objects both in unconstrained Euclidian space; as well as roadnetworks. In this paper; we focus on representing the uncertainty of the objects moving alongroad networks as time-dependent probability distribution functions; assuming availability of amaximal speed on each road segment. For these settings; we introduce a novel indexingmechanism--UTH (Uncertain Trajectories Hierarchy); based upon which efficient algorithmsfor processing spatio-temporal range queries are proposed.

On-line data reduction and the quality of history in moving objects databases,Goce Trajcevski; Hu Cao; Peter Scheuermanny; Ouri Wolfsonz; Dennis Vaccaro,Abstract In this work we investigate the quality bounds for the data stored in Moving ObjectsDatabases (MOD) in the settings in which mobile units can perform an on-board datareduction in real time. It has been demonstrated that line simplification techniques; whenproperly applied to the large volumes of data pertaining to the past trajectories of the movingobjects. result in substantial storage savings while guaranteeing deterministic error boundsto the queries posed to the MOD. On the other hand. it has also been demonstrated that ifmoving objects establish an agreement with the MOD regarding the (im) precision tolerancesignificant savings can be achieved in transmission when updating the location-in-timeinformation. In this paper we take a first step towards analyzing the quality of the history inmaking in MOD by correlating the (impact of the) agreement between the server and the …,Proceedings of the 5th ACM international workshop on Data engineering for wireless and mobile access,2006,60
Formal characterization of active databases,Chitta Baral; Jorge Lobo,Abstract In this paper we take a first step towards characterizing active databases.Declarative characterization of active databases allows additional flexibility in studying theeffects of different priority criteria between fireable rules; different actions and eventdefinitions; and also to make claims about effects of transaction and prove them withoutactually executing them. Our characterization is related but different from similar attempts byZaniolo in terms of making a clear distinction between actual and hypothetical execution ofactions and allowing non-determinism. We use the 'choice'construct [SZ90] to characterizethe non-determinism that arises when several rules can fire at the same time and thepreference between them is not specified. We show through examples how our languageallows us to express features of different active database systems.,*,1996,58
Dynamics-aware similarity of moving objects trajectories,Goce Trajcevski; Hui Ding; Peter Scheuermann; Roberto Tamassia; Dennis Vaccaro,Abstract This work addresses the problem of obtaining the degree of similarity betweentrajectories of moving objects. Typically; a Moving Objects Database (MOD) containssequences of (location; time) points describing the motion of individual objects; however;they also implicitly storethe velocity--an important attribute describing the dynamics themotion. Our main goal is to extend the MOD capability with reasoning about how similar arethe trajectories of objects; possibly moving along geographically different routes. We use adistance function which balances the lack of temporal-awareness of the Hausdorff distancewith the generality (and complexity of calculation) of the Fréchet distance. Based on theobservation that in practice the individual segments of trajectories are assumed to haveconstant speed; we provide efficient algorithms for:(1) optimal matching between …,Proceedings of the 15th annual ACM international symposium on Advances in geographic information systems,2007,56
Uncertain range queries for necklaces,Goce Trajcevski; Alok Choudhary; Ouri Wolfson; Li Ye; Gang Li,We address the problem of efficient processing of spatio-temporal range queries for movingobjects whose whereabouts in time are not known exactly. The fundamental questiontackled by such queries is; given a spatial region and a temporal interval; retrieve the objectsthat were inside the region during the given interval. As earlier works have demonstrated;when the location; time information is uncertain; syntactic constructs are needed to capturethe impact of the uncertainty; along with the corresponding processing algorithms. In thiswork; we focus on the uncertainty model that represents the whereabouts in-between twoknown locations as a bead and an uncertain trajectory is represented as a necklace--asequence of beads. For each syntactic variant of the range query; we present the respectiveprocessing algorithms and; in addition; we propose pruning strategies that speed up the …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2010 Eleventh International Conference on,2010,40
Formal characterizations of active databases: Part ii,Chitta Baral; Jorge Lobo; Goce Trajcevski,Abstract This paper presents a formal framework for specifying active database systems.Declarative characterization of active databases allows additional flexibility in defining animplementation-independent semantics of the active rules. The results extend the activedatabase description language introduced in [5]| with additional semantic dimensions. Wedemonstrate through examples how we can encode the active rules and their operationalbehavior from different existing systems.,International Conference on Deductive and Object-Oriented Databases,1997,38
Minimal and consistent evolution of knowledge bases,Jorge Lobo; Goce Trajcevski,ABSTRACT This work presents efficient algorithms to update knowledge bases in thepresence of integrity constraints. The algorithms ensure that the changes to the knowledgebases are minimal. We use the deductive database paradigm to represent knowledge.Minimality is defined as a natural partial order over possible models of the database andexpresses a preference for data explicity stored in the database over the data deduced bydefault. This requirement seems rational for many applications and yet it is hard to beexpressed with a set of integrity constraints. We handle safe negation and local variables inthe bodies of the rules. We tackle the issue of modifying the active domain (ie adding newconstants or removing some of the constants which are present in the knowledge base); andwe demonstrate how interaction with the user can be used to handle recursive definitions.,Journal of Applied Non-Classical Logics,1997,34
Real-time traffic updates in moving objects databases,Goce Trajcevski; Ouri Wolfson; Bo Xu; Peter Nelson,This work addresses the problem of updating moving objects databases (MOD) using real-time traffic information. The motion of the object is represented by a trajectory; which can beconstructed using the available electronic maps and the information about traffic patterns.However; the statistical information about traffic patterns may change due to accidents;extreme weather conditions; road work; etc. In this work; we present a model for updating thetrajectories of moving objects when unexpected traffic conditions occur. Many sites provideup-to-date information about traffic conditions on major expressways. However; theunexpected traffic conditions may affect not only the vehicles on the expressways for whichan on-line monitoring is provided; but may also have an effect on the streets near thoseexpressways. We propose a model of this spill-over effect and we utilize it in the process …,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 2002. Proceedings. 13th International Workshop on,2002,32

Michigan Ave.;Chicago (to pick-up a customer); or for a trucking company database a typical query may be:retrieve the trucks that are currently within 1 mile of truck ABT312 (which needs assistance);or for a database representing the current location of objects in a battlefield a typical querymay be: retrieve the friendly helicopters that are in a given region; or; retrieve the friendlyhelicopters that are expectedto enter the region within the next 10 minutes.

Efficient similarity join of large sets of moving object trajectories,Hui Ding; Goce Trajcevski; Peter Scheuermann,We address the problem of performing efficient similarity join for large sets of moving objectstrajectories. Unlike previous approaches which use a dedicated index in a transformedspace; our premise is that in many applications of location-based services; the trajectoriesare already indexed in their native space; in order to facilitate the processing of commonspatio-temporal queries; eg; range; nearest neighbor etc. We introduce a novel distancemeasure adapted from the classic Frechet distance; which canbe naturally extended tosupport lower/upper bounding using the underlying indices of moving object databases inthe native space. This; in turn; enables efficient implementation of various trajectory similarityjoins. We report on extensive experiments demonstrating that our methodology providesperformance speed-up of trajectory similarity join by more than 50% on average …,Temporal Representation and Reasoning; 2008.

Managing Uncertain Trajectories of Moving Objects with Domino.,Goce Trajcevski; Ouri Wolfson; Hu Cao; Hai Lin; Fengli Zhang; Naphtali Rishe,Abstract: This work describes the features of the DOMINO (Database fOr MovINg Objects)system; which brings several novelties to the problem of managing moving objectsdatabases. Our robust model of a trajectory cap- tures the inherent parameter of uncertainty ofthe moving objects location; which impacts both the semantics of spatio – temporal queries andthe algorithms for their processing. In DOMINO; we present a set of novel operators which capturethe spatial; temporal and uncertainty aspects of a moving object. The operators are implementedas UDFs (User Defined Functions) on top of existing ORDBMS and can be used for answeringqueries and generating notification triggers. DOMINO's implementation; in which ORDBMS arecoupled with other systems; seamlessly integrates several technologies: 1. existing electronicmaps are used to gener- ate the trajectory plan on behalf of a mobile user; 2. real-time …,ICEIS,2002,27
Ranking continuous nearest neighbors for uncertain trajectories,Goce Trajcevski; Roberto Tamassia; Isabel F Cruz; Peter Scheuermann; David Hartglass; Christopher Zamierowski,Abstract This article addresses the problem of performing Nearest Neighbor (NN) queries onuncertain trajectories. The answer to an NN query for certain trajectories is timeparameterized due to the continuous nature of the motion. As a consequence of uncertainty;there may be several objects that have a non-zero probability of being a nearest neighbor toa given querying object; and the continuous nature further complicates the semantics of theanswer. We capture the impact that the uncertainty of the trajectories has on the semantics ofthe answer to continuous NN queries and we propose a tree structure for representing theanswers; along with efficient algorithms to compute them. We also address the issue ofperforming NN queries when the motion of the objects is restricted to road networks. Finally;we formally define and show how to efficiently execute several variants of continuous NN …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2011,26
Bypassing holes in sensor networks: load-balance vs. latency,Goce Trajcevski; Fan Zhou; Roberto Tamassia; Besim Avci; Peter Scheuermann; Ashfaq Khokhar,This work addresses the problem of geographic routing in the presence of holes or voids inwireless sensor networks. We postulate that; once the boundary of the hole has beenestablished; relying on the existing algorithms for bypassing it may cause severe depletionof the energy reserves among the nodes at (or near) that boundary. This; in turn; may soonrender some of those nodes useless for any routing (and/or sensing) purposes; therebyeffectively enlarging the size of the pre-existing hole. To extend the lifetime of the nodesalong the boundary of a given hole; we propose two heuristic approaches which aim atrelieving some of the routing load of the boundary nodes. Towards that; our approachespropose that some of the routes that would otherwise need to bypass the hole along theboundary; should instead start to deviate from their original path further from the hole.

Deflection-aware tracking-principal selection in active wireless sensor networks,Fan Zhou; Goce Trajcevski; Oliviu Ghica; Roberto Tamassia; Peter Scheuermann; Ashfaq Khokhar,This paper addresses the problem of energy efficiency balanced with tracking accuracy inwireless sensor networks (WSNs). Specifically; we focus on the issues related to selectingtracking principals; ie; the nodes with two special tasks: 1) coordinating the activities amongthe sensors that are detecting the tracked object's locations in time and 2) selecting a nodeto which the tasks of coordination and data fusion will be handed off when the tracked objectexits the sensing area of the current principal. Extending the existing results that based therespective principal selection algorithms on the assumption that the target's trajectory isapproximated with straight line segments; we consider more general settings of (possibly)continuous changes of the direction of the moving target. We developed an approach basedon particle filters to estimate the target's angular deflection at the time of a handoff; and …,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2012,17
Selecting tracking principals with epoch awareness,Oliviu Ghica; Goce Trajcevski; Fan Zhou; Roberto Tamassia; Peter Scheuermann,Abstract This work addresses the problem of principal node selection during the trackingprocess in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In a typical tracking scenario; the location of amobile unit is determined via collaborative trilateration by the nodes that have the trackedobject within their sensing range. One of the participants in the trilateraion---the trackingprincipal---is in charge of transmitting the location and time information to a designated sink.However; as the moving object changes its location; a new principal needs to be determinedand handed off the task of the subsequent sensing; trilateration and transmission to the sink.We observe that in many WSN applications in which sensing/sampling needs to becombined with multihop transmission and; possibly; in-network aggregation; the typicalprocessing is organized in synchronized intervals; called epochs.

Mission-critical management of mobile sensors: or; how to guide a flock of sensors,Goce Trajcevski; Peter Scheuermann; Herve Brönnimann,Abstract This work addresses the problem of optimizing the deployment of sensors in orderto ensure the quality of the readings of the value of interest in a given (critical) geographicregion. As usual; we assume that each sensor is capable of reading a particular physicalphenomenon (eg; concentration of toxic materials in the air) and transmitting it to a server ora peer. However; the key assumptions considered in this work are: 1. each sensor iscapable of moving (where the motion may be remotely controlled); and 2. the spatial rangefor which the individual sensor's reading is guaranteed to be of a desired quality is limited. Inscenarios like disaster management and homeland security; in case some of the sensorsdispersed in a larger geographic area report a value higher than a certain threshold; onemay want to ensure a quality of the readings for the affected region. This; in turn; implies …,Proceeedings of the 1st international workshop on Data management for sensor networks: in conjunction with VLDB 2004,2004,15
Formalizing (and reasoning about) the specifications of workflows,Goce Trajcevski; Chitta Baral; Jorge Lobo,Abstract We address the problem of workflow requirements specifications under realisticassumptions that it involves experts from different domains (different business policies);where not all the possible execution scenarios known beforehand. Using recent results onreasoning about actions; we formalize the notion of the specifications' correctness. Toaddress this; we propose a high level language A_W as a basis of our prototype tool forprocess specification. We go “step” before actual analysis and design; and offer a formalismwhich enables the experts to specify their knowledge in terms of the effects that the activitieshave on the workflow environment.

Convective flow reversal in self-powered enzyme micropumps,Isamar Ortiz-Rivera; Henry Shum; Arjun Agrawal; Ayusman Sen; Anna C Balazs,Abstract Surface-bound enzymes can act as pumps that drive large-scale fluid flows in thepresence of their substrates or promoters. Thus; enzymatic catalysis can be harnessed for“on demand” pumping in nano-and microfluidic devices powered by an intrinsic energysource. The mechanisms controlling the pumping have not; however; been completelyelucidated. Herein; we combine theory and experiments to demonstrate a previouslyunreported spatiotemporal variation in pumping behavior in urease-based pumps anduncover the mechanisms behind these dynamics. We developed a theoretical model for thetransduction of chemical energy into mechanical fluid flow in these systems; capturingbuoyancy effects due to the solution containing nonuniform concentrations of substrate andproduct. We find that the qualitative features of the flow depend on the ratios of …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2016,14

Efficient location aware intrusion detection to protect mobile devices,Sausan Yazji; Peter Scheuermann; Robert P Dick; Goce Trajcevski; Ruoming Jin,Abstract This paper addresses the problem of efficient intrusion detection for mobile devicesvia correlating the user's location and time data. We developed two statistical profilingapproaches for modeling the normal spatio–temporal behavior of the users: one based onan empirical cumulative probability measure and the other based on the Markov propertiesof trajectories. An anomaly is detected when the probability of a particular (location; time)evolution matching the normal behavior of a given user becomes lower than a certainthreshold; determined by controlling the recall rate of the model of the normal user'sbehavior. We used compression techniques to reduce processing overhead whilemaintaining high accuracy.

Uncertainty in spatial trajectories,Goce Trajcevski,Abstract This chapter presents a systematic overview of the various issues and solutionsrelated to the notion of uncertainty in the settings of moving objects trajectories. The sourcesof uncertainty in this context are plentiful: from the mere fact that the positioning devices areinherently imprecise; to the pragmatic aspect that; although the objects are movingcontinuously; location-based servers can only be updated in discrete times. Hence come theproblems related to modelling and representing the uncertainty in Moving ObjectsDatabases (MOD) and; as a consequence; problems of efficient algorithms for processingvarious spatio-temporal queries of interest. Given the ever-presence of uncertainty since thedawn of philosophy through modern day nano-level science; after a brief introduction; wepresent a historic overview of the role of uncertainty in parts of the evolution of the human …,*,2011,13
Managing evolving shapes in sensor networks,Besim Avci; Goce Trajcevski; Peter Scheuermann,Abstract This work addresses the problem of efficient distributed detection and tracking ofmobile and evolving/deformable spatial shapes in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). Theshapes correspond to contiguous regions bounding the locations of sensors in which thereadings of the sensors satisfy a particular threshold-based criterion related to the values ofa physical phenomenon that they measure. We formalize the predicates representing theshapes in such settings and present detection algorithms. In addition; we provide a light-weight protocol and aggregation methods for energy-efficient distributed execution of thosealgorithms. Another contribution of this work is that we developed efficient techniques fordetecting a co-occurrence of shapes within a given proximity from each other.

Randomization in traffic information sharing systems,Masaaki Tanizaki; Ouri Wolfson,Abstract In this paper; we consider a traffic information sharing system based on FloatingCar Data (FCD). FCD is one of the methods used to gather traffic information; it usesvehicles as sensor nodes that transmit their speed to the server. The traffic informationsharing system broadcasts speed information updated by such transmission. Vehiclesreceiving broadcasted speed information can calculate travel time and select a minimumtime route. The communication cost and the load of the server are issues; because such atraffic information sharing system can generate a lot of wireless communication between thevehicles and the server [2][3]. However; reducing the amount of communication lowers theaccuracy of information provided by the server. In this paper we propose an Information CostModel to quantify a trade-off relationship between the communication cost of the system …,Proceedings of the 15th annual ACM international symposium on Advances in geographic information systems,2007,11
OMCAT: optimal maintenance of continuous queries' answers for trajectories,Hui Ding; Goce Trajcevski; Peter Scheuermann,Abstract We present our prototype system; OMCAT; which optimizes the reevaluation of a setof pending continuous spatio-temporal queries on trajectory data; when some of thetrajectories are affected by traffic abnormalities reported. The key observation that motivatesOMCAT is that an abnormality in a given geographical region may cause changes to theanswers of queries pertaining to future portions of affected trajectories. We investigate thesources of context-switching costs at various levels and propose solutions that utilize thecorrelation of several context dimensions to orchestrate the reevaluation of the queries.OMCAT; fully implemented on top of an existing Object Relational Database ManagementSystem-Oracle 9i; demonstrates that our techniques can substantially reduce the responsetime during query answer update.,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,11

Relevant syntacticelements of the user's queries and their semantic implications are identified; and the basiccomponents of a system that can be used for this task are specified. We show how triggerscan be used to maintain the answers to the users' queries" up to date" with respect to themodifications to the MOD and we demonstrate that our system can be implemented on top ofthe existing ORDBMS.,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 2003.

Controlled multi-path routing in sensor networks using bezier curves,Oliviu Ghica; Goce Trajcevski; Peter Scheuermann; Nikolay Valtchanov; Zachary Bischof,We address the problem of extending the lifetime of wireless sensor networks using multi-path routing based on a family of flexible routes with soft quality of service guarantees interms of the packets' delivery latency. We introduce a methodology based on Bezier curvesas guiding trajectories in the routing process and we address the balancing of the workloadamong neighboring nodes. An added benefit; due to the flexibility of the Bezier curves; isthat the shapes of the (alternate) routes can be constructed in a manner that prolongs thelifetime of the nodes in the vicinity of a given source/sink. We describe a forwardingalgorithm; where the relay nodes can determine locally the Bezier curve they belong to andwhich requires only the transmission of the so-called control points that determine the shapeof one (boundary) curve. We also show how our forwarding algorithm can be adapted to …,The Computer Journal,2011,10
CAT: Correct answers of continuous queries using triggers,Goce Trajcevski; Peter Scheuermann; Ouri Wolfson; Nimesh Nedungadi,Abstract Consider the query Q1: Retrieve all the motels which will be no further then 1.5miles from my route; sometime between 7: 00PM and 8: 30PM; which a mobile user posed tothe Moving Objects Database (MOD). Processing such queries is of interest to wide range ofapplications (eg tourist information systems and context awareness [1; 2]). These queriespertain to the future of a dynamic world. Since MOD is only a model of the objects moving inthe real world; the accuracy of the representation has to be continuously veri. ed andupdated; and the answer-set of Q1 has to be re-evaluated in every clock-tick1. However; there-evaluation of such queries can be avoided if an update to the MOD does not a. ect theanswer-set.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2004,10
Energy efficient in-network data indexing for mobile wireless sensor networks,Mohamed M Ali Mohamed; Ashfaq Khokhar; Goce Trajcevski,Abstract In-network indexing is a challenging problem in wireless sensor networks (WSNs);particularly when sensor nodes are mobile. In the past; several indexing structures havebeen proposed for WSNs for answering in-network queries; however; their maintenanceefficiency in the presence of mobile nodes is relatively less understood. Assuming thatmobility of the nodes is driven by an underlying mobility control algorithm or application; wepresent a novel distributed protocol for efficient maintenance of distributed hierarchicalindexing structures. The proposed protocol is generic; in the sense that it is applicable to anyhierarchical indexing structure that uses binary space partitioning (BSP); such as kd trees;Quadtrees and Octrees. It is based on locally expanding and shrinking convex regions suchthat update costs are minimized. Based on SIDnet-SWANS simulator; our experimental …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2013,9
Trajectory data reduction in wireless sensor networks,Oliviu Ghica; Goce Trajcevski; Ouri Wolfson; Ugo Buy; Peter Scheuermann; Fan Zhou; Dennis Vaccaro,This work addresses the problem of balancing the trade-off between the energy cost due tocommunication and the accuracy of the tracking-based trajectories' detection andrepresentation in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) settings. We consider some of theapproaches used by the Moving Objects Databases (MOD) and Computational Geometry(CG) communities; and we demonstrate that with appropriate adaptation; they can yieldsignificant benefits in terms of energy savings and; consequently; lifetime of a given WSN.Towards that; we developed distributed variations of three approaches for spatio-temporaldata reduction–two heuristics (Dead-Reckoning and the Douglas-Peuker algorithm); and avariant of a CG-based optimal algorithm for polyline reduction. In addition; we examinedifferent policies for managing the buffer used by the individual tracking nodes for storing …,International Journal of Next-Generation Computing,2010,9
CAR: controlled adjustment of routes and sensor networks lifetime,Goce Trajcevski; Oliviu Ghica; Peter Scheuermann,This work addresses the problem of extending the lifetime of a wireless sensor network;when a bounded delay on receiving the packets is acceptable for a given sink node. Thetemporal threshold for the Quality of Data (QoD) tolerance is specified with respect to thetime that it takes for the packets to travel from the source to the sink along an optimal route.For these settings; we propose a methodology that enables controlling the spatio-temporalload balancing among the sensors around the optimal route. Given the QoD threshold; weuse it to derive a set of parameterized Bezier curves which serve as alternate routesbetween the (source; sink) pair; relieving the nodes along the optimal route; while ensuringa bound on the delay of packets delivery. We provide experimental results whichdemonstrate that our proposed methodology can prolong the sensor networks' lifetime for …,Mobile Data Management; 2006.

Context-aware optimization of continuous range queries maintenance for trajectories,Goce Trajcevski; Hui Ding; Peter Scheuermann,Abstract This work addresses the problem of efficient maintenance of the (correct) answersto the continuous spatio-temporal range queries in Moving Objects Databases (MOD); whichrepresent the objects' motion as trajectories. Specifically; we consider the settings ofoptimizing the response time of the system when the queries need to be brought up-to-dateas a result of bulk update to the trajectories in the MOD. Such updates occur when anabnormality occurs in some context dimension (eg; road accident; fire) that affects manytrajectories in a given region. However; the updates of those trajectories may affect thecorrectness of the answers to queries which pertain to regions that are not spatially close tothe region where the abnormality occurred; and are interested in some future-time withrespect to the time of the occurrence of that abnormality.,Proceedings of the 4th ACM international workshop on Data engineering for wireless and mobile access,2005,9

In particular; since the main purpose of a workflow isto achieve a certain (bussiness) goal; we propose a formalism which enables the users tospecify their requirements (and expectations) and test if the information that they haveprovided is; in a sense; sufficient for the workflow to behave" as desired"; in terms of thegoal.

Improving the energy balance of field-based routing in wireless sensor networks,Goce Trajcevski; Oliviu Ghica; Peter Scheuermann; Marco Zuniga; Rene Schubotz; Manfred Hauswirth,Abstract-For high-density networks; several studies have proposed field-based routingparadigms to uniformly distribute the traffic load throughout the network. However; asnetwork density decreases; we observe major shortcomings of the current state-of-the-art:(i)fewer number of neighbors reduce the number of available paths and leads to path mergingand (ii) the paths directed towards the border of the network merge into a single path. Thesepath merging effects decrease significantly the energy balance; and as consequence; thelifetime of the network. In this paper; we propose a novel mechanism to enable a better loadbalancing for single-source and multiple-source scenarios. Our evaluations demonstratethat by using the proposed methodology; the network lifetime can be prolonged between30% and 40%.,Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM 2010); 2010 IEEE,2010,8
Dynamic topological predicates and notifications in moving objects databases,Goce Trajcevski; Peter Scheuermann; Hervé Brönnimann; Agnès Voisard,Abstract This work addresses the problem of efficient reactive management of topologicalpredicates in MOD (Moving Objects Databases) settings. Detecting the satisfiability of suchpredicates in mobile and dynamic environments requires management of continuous andpersistent conditions. We introduce two dynamical topological predicates: moving-along andmoving-towards and we present efficient algorithmic solutions for their processing. Based onthis; we subsequently take a deeper insight in the behavioral aspects of a MOD whichmanages them and we argue that the traditional ECA (Event Condition Action) paradigm;while it may ensure correct behavior; is not well-suited for enabling the users to declarativelyspecify some of the parameters that may affect the efficiency aspect of the reactive behavior.Towards this end; we introduce the (ECA) 2 (Evolving and Context-Aware Event …,Proceedings of the 6th international conference on Mobile data management,2005,8
Reactive maintenance of continuous queries,Goce Trajcevski; Peter Scheuermann,Abstract This work addresses the problem of maintaining the consistency of the answers tocontinuous queries which are posed by the users of the Moving Objects Databases (MOD).Assuming that the motion of the object is represented by a trajectory; we focus on the effectthat the modifications to the trajectory data can have on the queries answer-set. In case amobile user enters a road section in which an accident has occurred; which was notanticipated in the" expected" traffic behavior; not only his trajectory needs to updated; but theanswer to the query that he posed may need to be recalculated and transmitted again. In thiswork we propose a framework which enables detecting and processing the pending querieswhose answers need to be re-evaluated upon modifications to the MOD.

Towards fusing uncertain location data from heterogeneous sources,Bing Zhang; Goce Trajcevski; Liu Liu,Abstract Properly incorporating location-uncertainties–which is; fully considering their impactwhen processing queries of interest–is a paramount in any application dealing with spatio-temporal data. Typically; the location-uncertainty is a consequence of the fact that objectscannot be tracked continuously and the inherent imprecision of localization devices.Although there is a large body of works tackling various aspects of efficient management ofuncertainty in spatio-temporal data–the settings consider homogeneous localizationdevices; eg; either a Global Positioning System (GPS); or different sensors (roadside; indoor;etc.). In this work; we take a first step towards combining the uncertain location data–ie;fusing the uncertainty of moving objects location–obtained from both GPS devices androadside sensors.

We propose space and communication efficient schemescapable of correlating spatial dimension with different physical values. To trade-off (im)precision vs. energy consumption; the proposed schemes combine rank order statistics;regular sampling; and bitmap representation.

Tracking-based trajectory data reduction in wireless sensor networks,Goce Trajcevski; Oliviu C Ghica; Peter Scheuermann,This work addresses the problem of balancing the trade-off between the energy expensesdue to communication vs. the accuracy of the trajectories representation in Wireless SensorNetworks (WSN) where the spatio-temporal data is obtained by tracking. We consider someof the approaches used by the Moving Objects Databases (MOD) and ComputationalGeometry (CG) communities; and we demonstrate that; with appropriate modifications; theycan yield benefits in WSN in terms of energy savings. Towards that; we developeddistributed algorithms that implement the Dead-Reckoning policy for managing the transientlocation-in-time information of mobile entities; whose localization is done by trackingsensors. In addition; we developed a distributed variant of the Douglas-Peuker heuristic forpolyline reduction from CG literature; augmented with temporal awareness.

Monitored phenomena may require an increased coverage within a particulararea and we present novel methodologies for optimizing the" bargaining stage" whendeciding how to select the mobile resources to be re-located in response to such events.

Materialized views for count aggregates of spatial data,Anan Yaagoub; Xudong Liu; Goce Trajcevski; Egemen Tanin; Peter Scheuermann,Abstract We address the problem of efficient processing of count aggregate queries forspatial objects in OLAP systems. One of the main issues affecting the efficient spatialanalysis is the; so called; distinct counting problem. The core of the problem is due to the factthat spatial objects such as lakes; rivers; etc...–and their representations–have extents. Weinvestigate the trade-offs that arise when (semi) materialized views of the count aggregateare maintained in a hierarchical index and propose two data structures that are based on theQuadtree indexes: Fully Materialize Views (FMV) and Partially Materialized Views (PMV).Each aims at achieving a balance between the:(1) benefits in terms of response time forrange queries;(2) overheads in terms of extra space and update costs.

Motion trends detection in wireless sensor networks,Goce Trajcevski; Besim Avci; Fan Zhou; Roberto Tamassia; Peter Scheuermann; Lauren Miller; Adam Barber,We address the problem of efficient detection of destination-related motion trends inWireless Sensor Networks (WSN) where tracking is done in collaborative manner among thesensor nodes participating in location detection. In addition to determining a single location;applications may need to detect whether certain properties are true for the (portion of the)entire trajectories. Transmitting the sequence of (location; time) values to a dedicated sinkand relying on the sink to detect the validity of the desired properties is a brute-forceapproach that generates a lot of communication overhead. We present an in-networkdistributed algorithm for efficient detecting of the Continuously Moving Towards predicatewith respect to a given destination that is either a point or a region with polygonal boundary.Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approaches yield substantial savings …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2012 IEEE 13th International Conference on,2012,5

Protecting private data on mobile systems based on spatio-temporal analysis,Sausan Yazji; Robert P Dick; Peter Scheuermann; Goce Trajcevski,Abstract Mobile devices such as smart phones and laptops are in common use and carry avast amount of personal data. This paper presents an efficient behavior-based system forrapidly detecting the Theft of mobile devices in order to protect the private data of their users.Our technique uses spatio-temporal information to construct models of user motion patters.These models are used to detect theft; which may produce anomalous spatio-temporalpatterns. We consider two types of user models; each of which builds on the relationshipbetween location; and time of day. Our evaluation; based on the Reality Mining dataset.shows that our system is capable of detecting an attack within 15 minutes with 81%accuracy.,1st International Conference on Pervasive and Embedded Computing and Communication Systems; PECCS 2011,2011,5
A case for meta-triggers in wireless sensor networks,Goce Trajcevski; Nikoly Valtchanov; Oliviu C Ghica; Peter Scheuermann,This work addresses the problem of managing the reactive behavior in Wireless SensorNetworks (WSN). We consider settings in which the occurrence of a particular event;detected in a state that satisfies a given condition; should fire the execution of an action. Weobserve that in WSN settings; both the event and condition may pertain to some continuousphenomena that are monitored by distinct groups of nodes and; in addition; their respectivedetection may impose an extra communication overhead; if a correct executional behavior isdesired in terms of firing the action. Towards that end; we propose the concept of a {\it metatrigger}; which essentially translates a particular request; so that the communicationoverhead among the entities participating in its processing is minimized. We discuss a proof-of-concept implementation which demonstrates the benefits of the proposed methodology …,Network Computing and Applications; 2009. NCA 2009.

Bora: Routing and aggregation for distributed processing of spatio-temporal range queries,Goce Trajcevski; Hui Ding; Peter Scheuermann; Isabel F Cruz,This work tackles the problem of answer-aggregation for continuous spatio-temporal rangequeries in distributed settings. We assume a grid-like coverage of the spatial universe ofdiscourse; in which each cell is governed by a Base Station (BS) that communicates with themobile users in its zone; and is also equipped with a server that has Moving ObjectsDatabase (MOD) capabilities. The MOD server stores the data for the moving objects in agiven cell; processes the continuous queries pertaining to that cell; and is connected to theMOD servers in the neighboring cells. We demonstrate that; when a range query that spansover more than one cell needs to have its answer computed for a user located in a particularcell; by intelligently combining the transmission and the aggregation of the partial results;substantial improvements can be achieved at the global level. Towards this end; we …,Mobile Data Management; 2007 International Conference on,2007,5

Euler histogram tree: a spatial data structure for aggregate range queries on vehicle trajectories,Hairuo Xie; Egemen Tanin; Lars Kulik; Peter Scheuermann; Goce Trajcevski; Maryam Fanaeepour,Abstract This work addresses the problem of aggregation of trajectories data. Specifically;we propose a tree-based data structure for counting vehicle trajectories by mapping theminto a set of spatial histograms with different granularities. We also present an approach forprocessing spatio-temporal range queries by aggregating the histograms in the queryrectangles. The proposed methodology can be used for preserving the privacy of vehicledrivers by maintaining aggregated trajectory data. In addition; as we show; it can be used tohandle the well-known distinct counting problem. Experimental results show that the newdata structure achieves a high level of accuracy in query results and consistentlyoutperforms the leading histogram-based approach.,Proceedings of the 7th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Computational Transportation Science,2014,4
Voronoi trees for hierarchical in-network data and space abstractions in wireless sensor networks,Mohamed M Ali Mohamed; Ashfaq A Khokhar; Goce Trajcevski,Abstract We address the problem of spatial queries in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) viahybrid overlays; where the data values may correspond to different physical phenomenaand sensors may be correlated with spatial constraints. We show how hierarchical data andspace abstractions can be used to represent Voronoi Cell based partitions of the sensingfield and use Voronoi Trees to efficiently map the hierarchical abstractions for energy-efficient processing. The proposed scheme is simulated on the SidNET; a JiST/SWANSbased sensor network simulation platform.

Processing (multiple) spatio-temporal range queries in multicore settings,Goce Trajcevski; Anan Yaagoub; Peter Scheuermann,Abstract Research in Moving Objects Databases (MOD) has addressed various aspects ofstoring and querying trajectories of moving objects: from modelling; through linguisticconstructs and formalisms/algebras; to indexing structures and efficient processing ofdifferent query-categories have been subjects to a large body of works. Given thearchitectural trends of multicore CPUs becoming a commonplace; in this work we focus onefficient processing of spatio-temporal range queries in such settings. We postulate thatcoupling the semantics of the problem domain into the query processing algorithms in amanner that is aware of the multicore features; can yield performance improvements thatsurpass the gains obtained by relying solely on the compiler-generated threadsparallelization.

Alternating multiple tributaries+ deltas,Goce Trajcevski; Oliviu Ghica; Peter Scheuermann; Roberto Tamassia; Isabel F Cruz,Abstract This work addresses the problem of trading off the latency in delivering the answerto the sink at the benefit of balancing the spatial dispersion of the energy consumptionamong the nodes and; consequently; prolonging the lifetime in sensor networks. Typically; inresponse to a query that pertains to the data from some geographic region; a tree structure isconstructed and; when possible; some in-network aggregation is performed. On the otherhand; in order to increase the robustness and/or balance the load; multipath routing isemployed. Motivated by earlier work that combined trees and multipaths [19]; in this paperwe explore the possibility; and the impact; of combining multiple trees and multiplemultipaths for routing; when processing a query with respect to a given region of interest.

Towards Efficient Maintenance of Continuous MaxRS Query for Trajectories.,Muhammed Mas-ud Hussain; Kazi Ashik Islam; Goce Trajcevski; Mohammed Eunus Ali,ABSTRACT We address the problem of efficient maintenance of the answer to a new type ofquery: Continuous Maximizing Range-Sum (Co-MaxRS) for moving objects trajectories. Thetraditional static/spatial MaxRS problem finds a location for placing the centroid of a given(axes-parallel) rectangle R so that the sum of the weights of the point-objects from a givenset O inside the interior of R is maximized. However; moving objects continuously changetheir locations over time; so the MaxRS solution for a particular time instant need not be asolution at another time instant. In this paper; we devise the conditions under which aparticular MaxRS solution may cease to be valid and a new optimal location for the query-rectangle R is needed. More specifically; we solve the problem of maintaining the trajectoryof the centroid of R. In addition; we propose efficient pruning strategies (and …,EDBT,2017,3
Security of electrostatic field persistent routing: Attacks and defense mechanisms,Oliviu C Ghica; Cristina Nita-Rotaru; Goce Trajcevski; Peter Scheuermann,Abstract Electrostatic field-based routing (EFR) is a form of geographical multi-path routingwhere packets are routed along (a collection of) paths corresponding to electrostatic fieldlines defined by the charges associated with source and sink nodes. Ideally; EFR providesan efficient and scalable solution to the workload balancing problem; thereby promoting amore even depletion of the energy resources among the participating sensors. However; inaddition to not being adaptable to the realistic settings that consider the actual nodes'locations; it also assumes that nodes behave in a cooperative manner. This; in turn; rendersit vulnerable to various attacks.,Ad Hoc Networks,2016,3
Minimal spatio-temporal database repairs,Markus Mauder; Markus Reisinger; Tobias Emrich; Andreas Züfle; Matthias Renz; Goce Trajcevski; Roberto Tamassia,Abstract This work addresses the problem of efficient detection and fixing of inconsistenciesin spatio-temporal databases. In contrast to traditional database settings; where integrityconstraints pertain to explicitly stored values and values defined via views and aggregates;spatio-temporal data may exhibit other types of constraint violations that cannot be tied tostored or aggregated values. The main reason is that spatio-temporal phenomena arecontinuous but their database representations are discrete. Thus; the constraints aresemantic in nature; as opposed to being dependent on the actual stored data. We give ageneral definition of semantic constraints of a trajectory database and define rules to repairviolations of these constraints. In order to minimize the distortion of the state of the database;we aim at minimizing the changes needed for repairing violations of such semantic …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2015,3

Sensor synchronization for energy efficient multiple object tracking,Fan Zhou; Goce Trajcevski; Besim Avci; Peter Scheuermann,This work addresses the problem of synchronizing the sensors involved in the task ofmultiple object tracking (MOT) in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). We aim at reducing theoverall in-network energy consumption along with bounding the uncertainty regardingtargets' locations in WSN. Designing energy efficient scheduling mechanism is a challengein WSN tracking scenarios due to the limitations on target's movement prediction; and lack ofglobal network knowledge. The main observation of this work is that task conflicts andchannel congestion preclude the utilization of the nodes shared by common tracking tasks;which may result in poor Quality of Tracking (QoT) and/or increasing target ambiguity. Inorder to tackle this problem; we propose a lightweight sensor scheduling policy-Synchronization based Sampling Reduction (SSR); which explicitly prunes the redundant …,Networking; Sensing and Control (ICNSC); 2012 9th IEEE International Conference on,2012,3
Tracking coverage throughout epochs with bounded uncertainty,Fan Zhou; Goce Trajcevski; Besim Avci,This work addresses the problem of managing the sensor-coverage and organizing theepochs in a manner that balances the trades-offs between the accuracy and energyconsumptions during target tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). While the typicaltarget tracking approaches are based on movement prediction; we only assume aknowledge of some maximal speed of the target during certain time-intervals. This; in turn;restricts its whereabouts to a disk-bound area throughout such intervals. In such settings; weseek to determine a sensor cover; a subset of all the nodes that need to be awake; whichensures that the target can be detected during the given epoch.

We address the problem of workflow requirements specifications under realisticassumptions that it involves experts from different domains (different business policies);where not all the possible execution scenarios are known beforehand. Using recent resultson reasoning about actions; we formalize the notion of the specifications' correctness. Toaddress this; we propose a high level language AW as a basis of our prototype tool forprocess specification. We go" one step" before actual analysis and design; and offer aformalism which enables the experts to specify their knowledge in terms of the effects thatthe activities have on the workflow environment.

Clustering speed in multi-lane traffic networks,Bing Zhang; Goce Trajcevski; Feiying Liu,Abstract We address the problem of efficient spatio-temporal clustering of speed data in roadsegments with multiple lanes. We postulate that the navigation/route plans typically reportedby different providers as a single-value need not be accurate in multi-lane networks. Ourmethodology generates lane-aware distribution of speed from GPS data and agglomeratesthe basic space and time units into larger clusters.

Mobile users can contribute measured data fora variety of purposes; such as environmental monitoring; traffic analysis; or emergencyresponse. One important application scenario is that of detecting anomalous phenomena;where sensed data is crucial to quickly acquire data about forest fires; environmentalaccidents or dangerous weather events. Such cases typically require the construction of aheatmap that captures the distribution of a certain parameter over a geospatial domain (eg;temperature; CO _ 2 concentration; water polluting agents; etc.).

Load balancing for processing spatio-temporal queries in multi-core settings,Anan Yaagoub; Goce Trajcevski; Peter Scheuermann; Nikos Hardavellas,Abstract We address the problem of efficiently parallelizing the processing of spatio-temporal range queries in multicore settings. Although the data set can be partitioned andassigned to individual cores for processing a collection of range queries; one cannotachieve an" ideal" assignment for all the cores' load. Hence; the cores should collaborate ina dynamic manner: ones that have completed their (sub) tasks should take part of the loadfrom the cores that are still processing some of the data. We provide algorithms andsynchronization data structures that achieve such collaborative behavior and we investigatetheir impact in different initial load-partitioning strategies. Our experiments demonstrate thatabout 40% speed-up can be gained when compared to static load-partitioning and that theproposed approach scales well.,Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM International Workshop on Data Engineering for Wireless and Mobile Access,2012,2

Identifying human mobility via trajectory embeddings,Qiang Gao; Fan Zhou; Kunpeng Zhang; Goce Trajcevski; Xucheng Luo; Fengli Zhang,Abstract Understanding human trajectory patterns is an important task in many locationbased social networks (LBSNs) applications; such as personalized recommendation andpreference-based route planning. Most of the existing methods classify a trajectory (or itssegments) based on spatio-temporal values and activities; into some predefined categories;eg; walking or jogging. We tackle a novel trajectory classification problem: we identify andlink trajectories to users who generate them in the LBSNs; a problem called Trajectory-UserLinking (TUL). Solving the TUL problem is not a trivial task because:(1) the number of theclasses (ie; users) is much larger than the number of motion patterns in the commontrajectory classification problems; and (2) the location based trajectory data; especially thecheck-ins; are often extremely sparse. To address these challenges; a Recurrent Neural …,Proceedings of the 26th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2017,1
Bypassing holes in sensor networks: Load-balance vs. latency,Fan Zhou; Goce Trajcevski; Roberto Tamassia; Besim Avci; Ashfaq Khokhar; Peter Scheuermann,Abstract This work addresses problems that arise when geographic routing is used in thepresence of holes in wireless sensor networks. We postulate that relying on the existingalgorithms for bypassing a coverage hole may cause more severe depletion of the energyreserves among the nodes at (or near) that hole's boundary. This; in turn; will render some ofthose nodes useless for any routing (and/or sensing) purposes; thereby effectively enlargingthe size of existing hole and inducing longer communication delays for certain (source; sink)pairs. We propose heuristics that address these complementary problems:(1) relieving someof the routing-load for the nodes around the boundary of a given hole; for the purpose ofextending their lifetime; and (2) reducing the latency of the packets-delivery by using routesthat are within certain bounds from the route based on the shortest-path.

The traditional; ComputationalGeometry version of the MaxRS problem considers the setting in which; given a set of(possibly weighted) 2D points; the goal is to determine the optimal location for a given (axes-parallel) rectangle R to be placed so that the sum of the weights (or; a simple count) of theinput points in R's interior is maximized. In WSN; this corresponds to finding the location ofregion R such that the sum of the sensors' readings inside R is maximized. The k-MaxRSproblem deals with maximizing the overall sum over k such rectangular regions. Sincecentralized processing–ie; transmitting the raw readings and subsequently determining the k-MaxRS in a dedicated sink–incur communication overheads; we devised an efficient …,SENSORNETS,2017,1

This enables capturing the similarity between different annotationsdescribing Points of Interest (POI); locations and activities. We formally define the inclusionof the relationship between different terms used as descriptors in symbolic trajectories andpresent the Semantic Relatedness in Trajectories Data Warehouse (SR-TDW) model. Weintroduce newly enabled queries in the SR-TDW model and illustrate the impacts of theadded functionality.

Co-MaxRS: Continuous Maximizing Range-Sum Query,Muhammed Mas-ud Hussain; Alex Wang; Goce Trajcevski,Abstract We address the problem of efficient maintenance of Continuous Maximizing Range-Sum (Co-MaxRS) query for moving objects trajectories. The traditional MaxRS problem aimsat finding a placement for a given (axes-parallel) rectangle R so that the number---or thesum of the weights---of objects (points) from a given set O in the interior of R is maximized.However; in the context of spatio-temporal data; due to the objects continuously changingtheir locations over time; the MaxRS solution for a particular time instant need not be asolution at another time instant. In this paper; we take a first step towards effectivealgorithmic solutions for this dynamic case.

Probabilistic Speed Profiling for Multi-Lane Road Networks,Bing Zhang; Goce Trajcevski,We address the problem of incorporating uncertain location data in the generation of speedprofiles for vehicles on roads with multiple lanes. Moving objects' location data can beobtained from different/multiple sources-eg; GPS on-board the moving objects; roadsidesensors; cameras. However; each source has inherent limitations that affect the precision-from pure measurement-errors; to sparsity of their distribution. Incorporating suchimprecision is paramount in any query/analytics oriented system that deals with locationdata. The difficulties multiply when one needs to reason about localization with lane-awareness and attempts to use the location-in-time data to enable effective navigationsystems.

Introduction to this Special Issue: Spatio-Temporal Uncertainty.,Goce Trajcevski,The impact of the imperfect knowledge on the reasoning and beliefs has been an importanttopic throughout all the stages of human civilization; for scientists; engineers; philosophersand logicians alike. With the advent of the computing; sensing and communicationstechnologies; the importance of capturing the uncertain/probabilistic nature of the data hasbecome vital in numerous application domains. When it comes to spatial and temporal–and;of course; spatio-temporal–data; the uncertainty arises not only because of the errors inmeasurements (eg; the imprecision of the GPS devices); but also because continuousphenomena are attempted to be represented with finite/discrete number of values.

On the link (s) between “D” and “A” in Mobile Data Analytics,Goce Trajcevski,This paper addresses the issue of (meta) management of the efficiency in the realm ofapplications relying on Mobile Data Analytics (MODA). We postulate that considering theefficient execution of the tasks of gathering; storing/retrieving and querying spatio-temporaldata separately from the efficiency of executing control and decision-making (or; for thatmatter; even model-selection) algorithms may not be the most beneficial avenue in MODAsettings. We argue that an important component is the management of the dynamics of thedifferent tradeoff (s) and; more importantly; linking them when orchestrating the processes ofthe data management and analytics. Towards that end; we present the DNA2 (Data's NaturalAssociations with Analytics) hypothesis for coupling the data and control aspects in MODAcontexts.

Collaborative reactive behavior in heterogeneous wireless sensor networks,Jedidiah McClurg; Goce Trajcevski; Jesse Yanutola,Abstract Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) which contain heterogeneous nodes and monitormultiple phenomena present a unique set of challenges in regards to efficient managementof reactive behavior. The ECA (on Event if Condition then Action) paradigm from ActiveDatabases offers a solution via event-based synchronization which provides reducedenergy consumption compared to continuous monitoring. In our demo; we show how toutilize this approach via compilation of system-level ECA triggers to mote-specific triggercode. We also demonstrate the practicality of the approach by constructing a heterogeneousWSN of TelosB/SunSPOT motes and using our tools to implement reactive behaviors basedon temperature/luminance data.,Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Embedded Network Sensor Systems,2012,*
Collaborative coupling of sensing and actuation: uncertainty beyond querying,Goce Trajcevski,This talk will present an opportunity for extending the role of spatio-temporal uncertaintybeyond its traditional realm of data management. The main motivation is that; in practice; it isoften the case that the devices that perform sensing/management are either within the sameembedded system; or a closely coupled with the devices the perform actuation. However;the actuation (which typically implements some control logic) may have an additional impacton the system under consideration.,Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS); 2012 International Conference on,2012,*

Efficient Intrusion Detection for Mobile Devices Using Spatio-Temporal Mobility Patterns,Sausan Yazji; Robert P Dick; Peter Scheuermann; Goce Trajcevski,Abstract Mobile phones are ubiquitous and are used for email; text messages; navigation;education; and as a pyment tool (eg; Mobile Money-extensively used in China and Japan[1]). Consequently; mobile devices carry a lot of personal data and; if stolen; that data can bemore important than the loss of the device. Most of the works on mobile devices securityhave focused on physical aspects and/or access control; which do not protect the privatedata on a stolen device that is in the post authentication state. However; some existingworks; eg Laptop Cop [2] aim to protect data on stolen devices by remotely and manuallydeleting it; which requires user intervention. It may take hours before the user notices theloss of his device.,International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Computing; Networking; and Services,2010,*
Sensing; Triggers and Mobile (Meta) Data,Goce Trajcevski; Alok Choudhary; Peter Scheuermann,Processing spatio-temporal queries pertaining to the whereabouts of a large number ofmobile entities has traditionally been the topic of the Moving Objects Databases (MOD)research. More recently; due to the advances in sensing and communication technologies;part of the Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) applications have focused on tracking of mobileobjects. These two observations are enough of to warrant a" call" for a confluence of tworelatively new but established disciplines.

Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department,Matthew Evans Klenk,Abstract In large-scale parallel systems scientific workloads consist of numerous processesrunning across many nodes. Their memory footprint is massive; however many studies fromboth our and others' works have shown that significant amount of memory contentredundancy usually exists in these systems. This has consequences for services thatenhance performance; reliability; or power. For example; leveraging content sharing couldsignificantly reduce the size of a checkpoint of a group of nodes. As another example; itcould speed VM migration by allowing the reconstruction of a VM's memory from multiplesource VMs. Finally; a service that improves reliability by introducing memory redundancycould leverage existing content sharing to minimize the memory costs of any particular levelof redundancy. I argue that; a facility that continuously tracks and identifies the sharing of …,*,2009,*

Efficient Tracking of Uncertain Evolving Shapes with Probabilistic,Besim Avci; Goce Trajcevski; Peter Scheuermann,Abstract We address the problem of balancing trade-off between the (im) precision of theanswer to evolving spatial queries and efficiency of their processing in Wireless SensorNetworks (WSN). Specifically; we focus on scenarios where; in addition to simplemeasurements one is also interested in the boundaries of a shape in which all the sensors'readings satisfy a certain criteria. Given the evolution of the underlying phenomenon beingtracked/monitored; the changes of the corresponding sensed values imply that theboundaries of the shape (s) will also evolve over time. To avoid sending constant updates ofthe individual sensor-readings to a dedicated sink {and yet provide certain guarantees onthe answer to user's queries posed to the server which stores the spatial data pertaining tothe evolving shapes {we propose a methodology where the accuracy of the answer is …,Trans. on Knowl. and Data Eng,2007,*

Adaptive and context-aware reconciliation of reactive and pro-active behavior in evolving systems,Goce Trajcevski; Peter Scheuermann,Abstract One distinct characteristics of the context-aware systems is their ability to react andadapt to the evolution of the environment; which is often a result of changes in the values ofvarious (possibly correlated) attributes. Based on these changes; reactive systems typicallytake corrective actions; eg; adjusting parameters in order to maintain the desiredspecifications of the system's state. Pro-active systems; on the other hand; may change themode of interaction with the environment as well as the desired goals of the system. In thispaper we describe our (ECA) 2 paradigm for reactive behavior with proactive impact and wepresent our ongoing work and vision for a system that is capable of context-awareadaptation; while ensuring the maintenance of a set of desired behavioral policies.

OMCAT: optimal maintenance of continuous queries' answers for trajectories,Goce Trajcevski; Peter Scheuermann,ABSTRACT We present our prototype system; OMCAT; which optimizes the reevaluation ofa set of pending continuous spatio-temporal queries on trajectory data; when some of thetrajectories are affected by traffic abnormalities reported. The key observation that motivatesOMCAT is that an abnormality in a given geographical region may cause changes to theanswers of queries pertaining to future portions of affected trajectories. We investigate thesources of contextswitching costs at various levels and propose solutions that utilize thecorrelation of several context dimensions to orchestrate the reevaluation of the queries.OMCAT; fully implemented on top of an existing Object Relational Database ManagementSystem–Oracle 9i; demonstrates that our techniques can substantially reduce the responsetime during query answer update.,*,2006,*

Ashas already been observed in the literature; the answers to continuous NN-queries inspatiotemporal settings are time parameterized in the sense that the objects constituting theanswer vary over time. Incorporating uncertainty in the model yields additional attributes thataffect the semantics of the answer to this type of queries. In this report; we firstly formalize theimpact of uncertainty on the answers to the continuous probabilistic NN-queries (ie; thesemantics of the answer to such queries); and we provide a compact structure for itsrepresentation. Then; we propose efficient algorithms for constructing that structure. For …,*,*,*

CAT: Correct Answers of Continuous Queries,Goce Trajcevski; Peter Scheuermann; Ouri Wolfson; Nimesh Nedungadi,Consider the query Q1: Retrieve all the motels which will be no further then 1.5 miles frommy route; sometime between 7: 00PM and 8: 30PM; which a mobile user posed to theMoving Objects Database (MOD). Processing such queries is of interest to wide range ofapplications (eg tourist information systems and context awareness [1; 2]). These queriespertain to the future of a dynamic world. Since MOD is only a model of the objects moving inthe real world; the accuracy of the representation has to be continuously verified andupdated; and the answer-set of Q1 has to be re-evaluated in every clock-tick1. However; there-evaluation of such queries can be avoided if an update to the MOD does not affect theanswer-set.,Edited by G. Goos; J. Hartmanis; and J. van Leeuwen,*,*
Discrepancy: The Neglected Description of Wireless Sensor Networks (and its Applications),Goce Trajcevski,1. Increasing the reliability/robustness of the packets delivery to a particular destination [2; 3]2. Balancing the load among the available relay-nodes [4; 5; 6] which; in turn; contributestowards the better balancing of the residual energy in the network; thereby prolonging itsoverall lifetime.,*,*,*
