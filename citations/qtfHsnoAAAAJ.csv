MAUI: making smartphones last longer with code offload,Eduardo Cuervo; Aruna Balasubramanian; Dae-ki Cho; Alec Wolman; Stefan Saroiu; Ranveer Chandra; Paramvir Bahl,Abstract This paper presents MAUI; a system that enables fine-grained energy-aware offloadof mobile code to the infrastructure. Previous approaches to these problems either reliedheavily on programmer support to partition an application; or they were coarse-grainedrequiring full process (or full VM) migration. MAUI uses the benefits of a managed codeenvironment to offer the best of both worlds: it supports fine-grained code offload tomaximize energy savings with minimal burden on the programmer. MAUI decides at run-time which methods should be remotely executed; driven by an optimization engine thatachieves the best energy savings possible under the mobile device's current connectivityconstrains. In our evaluation; we show that MAUI enables: 1) a resource-intensive facerecognition application that consumes an order of magnitude less energy; 2) a latency …,Proceedings of the 8th international conference on Mobile systems; applications; and services,2010,1826
Energy consumption in mobile phones: a measurement study and implications for network applications,Niranjan Balasubramanian; Aruna Balasubramanian; Arun Venkataramani,Abstract In this paper; we present a measurement study of the energy consumptioncharacteristics of three widespread mobile networking technologies: 3G; GSM; and WiFi. Wefind that 3G and GSM incur a high tail energy overhead because of lingering in high powerstates after completing a transfer. Based on these measurements; we develop a model forthe energy consumed by network activity for each technology. Using this model; we developTailEnder; a protocol that reduces energy consumption of common mobile applications. Forapplications that can tolerate a small delay such as e-mail; TailEnder schedules transfers soas to minimize the cumulative energy consumed meeting user-specified deadlines. Weshow that the TailEnder scheduling algorithm is within a factor 2x of the optimal and showthat any online algorithm can at best be within a factor 1.62 x of the optimal.

DTN routing as a resource allocation problem,Aruna Balasubramanian; Brian Levine; Arun Venkataramani,Abstract Many DTN routing protocols use a variety of mechanisms; including discovering themeeting probabilities among nodes; packet replication; and network coding. The primaryfocus of these mechanisms is to increase the likelihood of finding a path with limitedinformation; so these approaches have only an incidental effect on such routing metrics asmaximum or average delivery latency. In this paper; we present RAPID; an intentional DTNrouting protocol that can optimize a specific routing metric such as worst-case deliverylatency or the fraction of packets that are delivered within a deadline. The key insight is totreat DTN routing as a resource allocation problem that translates the routing metric into per-packet utilities which determine how packets should be replicated in the system.

Augmenting mobile 3G using WiFi,Aruna Balasubramanian; Ratul Mahajan; Arun Venkataramani,Abstract We investigate if WiFi access can be used to augment 3G capacity in mobileenvironments. We rst conduct a detailed study of 3G and WiFi access from moving vehicles;in three different cities. We find that the average 3G and WiFi availability across the cities is87% and 11%; respectively. WiFi throughput is lower than 3G through-put; and WiFi lossrates are higher. We then design a system; called Wiffler; to augments mobile 3G capacity. Ituses two key ideas leveraging delay tolerance and fast switching--to overcome the pooravailability and performance of WiFi. For delay tolerant applications; Wiffler uses a simplemodel of the environment to predict WiFi connectivity. It uses these predictions to delaystransfers to offload more data on WiFi; but only if delaying reduces 3G usage and thetransfers can be completed within the application's tolerance threshold.

Interactive wifi connectivity for moving vehicles,Aruna Balasubramanian; Ratul Mahajan; Arun Venkataramani; Brian Neil Levine; John Zahorjan,Abstract We ask if the ubiquity of WiFi can be leveraged to provide cheap connectivity frommoving vehicles for common applications such as Web browsing and VoIP. Driven by thisquestion; we conduct a study of connection quality available to vehicular WiFi clients basedon measurements from testbeds in two different cities. We find that current WiFi handoffmethods; in which clients communicate with one basestation at a time; lead to frequentdisruptions in connectivity. We also find that clients can overcome many disruptions bycommunicating with multiple basestations simultaneously. These findings lead us to developViFi; a protocol that opportunistically exploits basestation diversity to minimize disruptionsand support interactive applications for mobile clients. ViFi uses a decentralized andlightweight probabilistic algorithm for coordination between participating basestations …,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2008,292

Demystifying Page Load Performance with WProf.,Xiao Sophia Wang; Aruna Balasubramanian; Arvind Krishnamurthy; David Wetherall,Abstract Web page load time is a key performance metric that many techniques aim toreduce. Unfortunately; the complexity of modern Web pages makes it difficult to identifyperformance bottlenecks. We present WProf; a lightweight in-browser profiler that producesa detailed dependency graph of the activities that make up a page load. WProf is based on amodel we developed to capture the constraints between network load; page parsing;JavaScript/CSS evaluation; and rendering activity in popular browsers. We combine WProfreports with critical path analysis to study the page load time of 350 Web pages under avariety of settings including the use of end-host caching; SPDY instead of HTTP; and themod pagespeed server extension. We find that computation is a significant factor that makesup as much as 35% of the critical path; and that synchronous JavaScript plays a …,NSDI,2013,153
Web search from a bus,Aruna Balasubramanian; Yun Zhou; W Bruce Croft; Brian Neil Levine; Aruna Venkataramani,Abstract Opportunistic connections to the Internet from open wireless access points is nowcommonly possible in urban areas. Vehicular networks can opportunistically connect to theInternet for several seconds via open access points. In this paper; we adapt the interactiveprocess of web search and retrieval to vehicular networks with intermittent Internet access.Our system; called Thedu; has mobile nodes use an Internet proxy to collect search engineresults and prefetch result pages. The mobile nodes download the pre-fetched web pagesfrom the proxy. Our contribution is a novel set of techniques to make aggressive but selectiveprefetching practical; resulting in a significantly greater number of relevant web resultsreturned to mobile users. In particular; we prioritize responses in the order of the usefulnessof the response to the query; that allows the mobile node to download the most useful …,Proceedings of the second ACM workshop on Challenged networks,2007,124
How speedy is SPDY?,Xiao Sophia Wang; Aruna Balasubramanian; Arvind Krishnamurthy; David Wetherall,Abstract SPDY is increasingly being used as an enhancement to HTTP/1.1. To understandits impact on performance; we conduct a systematic study of Web page load time (PLT)under SPDY and compare it to HTTP. To identify the factors that affect PLT; we proceed fromsimple; synthetic pages to complete page loads based on the top 200 Alexa sites. We findthat SPDY provides a significant improvement over HTTP when we ignore dependencies inthe page load process and the effects of browser computation. Most SPDY benefits stemfrom the use of a single TCP connection; but the same feature is also detrimental under highpacket loss. Unfortunately; the benefits can be easily overwhelmed by dependencies andcomputation; reducing the improvements with SPDY to 7% for our lower bandwidth andhigher RTT scenarios. We also find that request prioritization is of little help; while server …,NSDI,2014,111
Enhancing interactive web applications in hybrid networks,Aruna Balasubramanian; Brian Neil Levine; Arun Venkataramani,Abstract Mobile Internet users have several options today including high bandwidth cellulardata services such as 3G; that may be the choice for many. However; the ubiquity and lowcost of WiFi suggests an attractive alternative; namely; opportunistic use of open WiFi accesspoints (APs) or planned municipal mesh networks. Unfortunately; for vehicular users; theintermittent nature of WiFi connectivity makes it challenging to support popular interactiveapplications such as Web search and browsing. Our work is driven by two questions. 1) Howcan we enable system support for interactive web applications to tolerate disruptions in WiFiconnectivity from mobile nodes? 2) Can opportunistic mobile-to-mobile (m2m) transfersenhance application performance over only using APs; and if so; under what conditions andby how much?,Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking,2008,100
DOME: a diverse outdoor mobile testbed,Hamed Soroush; Nilanjan Banerjee; Aruna Balasubramanian; Mark D Corner; Brian Neil Levine; Brian Lynn,Abstract A series of complex dependencies conspire to make it difficult to model mobilenetworks; including mobility; channel and radio characteristics; and power consumption. Toaddress these challenges; we have designed and built a testbed for large-scale mobileexperimentation; called the Diverse Outdoor Mobile Environment. DOME consists ofcomputer-equipped buses; battery-powered nomadic nodes; organic WiFi APs; and amunicipal WiFi mesh network. While the construction of a testbed such as DOME presents asignificant engineering challenge; this paper describes a concrete set of scientific resultsderived from this experience. We argue that a broad range of mobility experiments could beperformed in a testbed which provides the properties of temporal; technological; and spatialdiversity. We demonstrate these properties in our testbed through analysis of data …,Proceedings of the 1st ACM International Workshop on Hot Topics of Planet-Scale Mobility Measurements,2009,73
A cross-layer based intrusion detection approach for wireless ad hoc networks,Geethapriya Thamilarasu; Aruna Balasubramanian; Sumita Mishra; Ramalingam Sridhar,Wireless ad-hoc networks are vulnerable to various kinds of security threats and attacks dueto relative ease of access to wireless medium and lack of a centralized infrastructure. In thispaper; we seek to detect and mitigate the denial of service (DoS) attacks that preventauthorized users from gaining access to the networks. These attacks affect the serviceavailability and connectivity of the wireless networks and hence reduce the networkperformance. To this end; we propose a novel cross-layer based intrusion detection system(CIDS) to identify the malicious node (s). Exploiting the information available across differentlayers of the protocol stack by triggering multiple levels of detection; enhances the accuracyof detection. We validate our design through simulations and also demonstrate loweroccurrence of false positives,Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems Conference; 2005. IEEE International Conference on,2005,65
R3: robust replication routing in wireless networks with diverse connectivity characteristics,Xiaozheng Tie; Arun Venkataramani; Aruna Balasubramanian,Abstract Our work is motivated by a simple question: can we design a simple routingprotocol that ensures robust performance across networks with diverse connectivitycharacteristics such as meshes; MANETs; and DTNs? We identify packet replication as akey structural difference between protocols designed for opposite ends of the connectivityspectrum---DTNs and meshes. We develop a model to quantify under what conditions andby how much replication improves packet delays; and use these insights to drive the designof R3; a routing protocol that self-adapts replication to the extent of uncertainty in networkpath delays. We implement and deploy R3 on a mesh testbed and a DTN testbed. To thebest of our knowledge; R3 is the first routing protocol to be deployed and evaluated on botha DTN testbed and a mesh testbed. We evaluate its performance through deployment …,Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking,2011,57

An in-depth study of mobile browser performance,Javad Nejati; Aruna Balasubramanian,Abstract Mobile page load times are an order of magnitude slower compared to non-mobilepages. It is not clear what causes the poor performance: the slower network; the slowercomputational speeds; or other reasons. Further; most Web optimizations are designed fornon-mobile browsers and do not translate well to the mobile browser. Towardsunderstanding mobile Web page load times; in this paper we:(1) perform an in-depthpairwise comparison of loading a page on a mobile versus a non-mobile browser; and (2)characterize the bottlenecks in the mobile browser {\em vis-a-vis} non-mobile browsers. Tothis end; we build a testbed that allows us to directly compare the low-level page loadactivities and bottlenecks when loading a page on a mobile versus a non-mobile browser.We find that computation is the main bottleneck when loading a page on mobile browsers …,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web,2016,20
Enhancing mobile apps to use sensor hubs without programmer effort,Haichen Shen; Aruna Balasubramanian; Anthony LaMarca; David Wetherall,Abstract Always-on continuous sensing apps drain the battery quickly because they preventthe main processor from sleeping. Instead; sensor hub hardware; available in manysmartphones today; can run continuous sensing at lower power while keeping the mainprocessor idle. However; developers have to divide functionality between the mainprocessor and the sensor hub. We implement MobileHub; a system that automaticallyrewrites applications to leverage the sensor hub without additional programming effort.MobileHub uses a combination of dynamic taint tracking and machine learning to learnwhen it is safe to leverage the sensor hub without affecting application semantics. Weimplement MobileHub in Android and prototype a sensor hub on a 8-bit AVR micro-controller. We experiment with 20 applications from Google Play.

Analysis of a hybrid key management solution for ad hoc networks,Aruna Balasubramanian; Sumita Mishra; Ramalingam Sridhar,Designing a key management system is both important and challenging for wireless ad hocnetworks. We have developed a secure; scalable; decentralized and robust keymanagement solution using a hybrid (symmetric/asymmetric) key based methodology that iswell suited for ad hoc networks. The nodes are grouped into clusters; and keys aredistributed such that intra-cluster communication is secured using a symmetric cryptosystemand inter-cluster communication is secured using an asymmetric cryptosystem. We present adetailed analysis of the solution and simulation results. We observe that the hybrid solutionprovides a significant improvement in the performance of the key management solution in ahighly hostile environment; and scales well to large networks.,Wireless Communications and Networking Conference; 2005 IEEE,2005,17
Tula: Balancing energy for sensing and communication in a perpetual mobile system,Jacob Sorber; Aruna Balasubramanian; Mark D Corner; Joshua R Ennen; Carl Qualls,Due to advances in low power sensors; energy harvesting; and disruption tolerantnetworking; we can now build mobile systems that operate perpetually; sensing andstreaming data directly to scientists. However; factors such as energy harvesting variabilityand unpredictable network connectivity make building robust and perpetual systems difficult.In this paper; we present a system; Tula; that balances sensing with data delivery; to allowperpetual and robust operation across highly dynamic and mobile networks. This balance isespecially important in unpredictable environments; sensing more data than can bedelivered by the network is not useful; while gathering less underutilizes the system'spotential.

FindAll: a local search engine for mobile phones,Aruna Balasubramanian; Niranjan Balasubramanian; Samuel J Huston; Donald Metzler; David J Wetherall,Abstract We present the design and evaluation of FindAll; a local search engine that letsusers search and retrieve web pages; even in the absence of connectivity. Our user studywith 23 users show that mobile users often search for web pages that they have previouslyvisited; known as re-finding. This re-finding behavior makes the case for a local solution.FindAll goes beyond caching and using keyword search; and instead; implements a fullblown search engine. The key challenge in FindAll is in designing a search engine; which isboth memory-and energy-intensive; on the constrained phone environment. To this end;FindAll balances the cost of running the search engine with the expected benefits of servinga web page locally. FindAll estimates the benefits of local search; by learning the re-findingbehavior of users.

Architecting protocols to enable mobile applications in diverse wireless networks,Aruna Balasubramanian,Abstract The goal of this thesis is to architect robust protocols that overcome disruptions andenable applications in diverse mobile networks. Mobile users operate in diverseenvironments; starting from mostly connected cellular networks to mostly disconnected delaytolerant networks (DTNs). Each of these networks are prone to frequent disruptions due tomobility; coverage holes; poor channel conditions; and other factors. Designing protocols totolerate such disruptions is challenging because of the extreme uncertainty in mobilewireless environments. In this thesis; I focus on four networks that span the diverseconnectivity spectrum and answer the following questions for each network:(1) What are thedisruption characteristics in the network and what are the opportunities that can be exploitedin the network?; and (2) What protocol design best exploits the opportunities to overcome …,*,2011,12
Wireless security protocol using a low cost pseudo random number generator,Karthik Ramakrishnan; Aruna Balasubramanian; Sumita Mishra; Ramalingam Sridhar,In this work; we present a security solution for wireless networks using a novel low costpseudo random number generator (PRNG). The PRNG is developed by superimposing acertain number or periodic waves such that the same pseudo random number is generatedat two different devices that share a secret key. The generated pseudo random numbers areused for securing messages between the two devices. It is shown that this PRNG is capableof self synchronization; secure against most attacks and can be implemented both inhardware and software. In addition; the solution is lightweight and is ideal for wirelesscommunication where the devices may be resource constrained. Analysis and extensivetesting using the DIEHARD tests indicate that the developed PRNG exhibits high statisticalrandomness.

Improving User Perceived Page Load Times Using Gaze.,Conor Kelton; Jihoon Ryoo; Aruna Balasubramanian; Samir R Das,Abstract We take a fresh look at Web page load performance from the point of view of userexperience. Our user study shows that perceptual performance; defined as user-perceivedpage load time (uPLT) poorly correlates with traditional page load time (PLT) metrics.However; most page load optimizations are designed to improve the traditional PLT metrics;rendering their impact on user experience uncertain. Instead; we present WebGaze; asystem that specifically optimizes for the uPLT metric. The key insight in WebGaze is thatuser attention and interest can be captured using a user's eye gaze and can inturn be usedto improve uPLT. We collect eye gaze data from 50 users across 45 Web pages and find thatthere is commonality in user attention across users. Specifically; users are drawn to certainregions on the page; that we call regions of high collective fixation. WebGaze prioritizes …,NSDI,2017,8

Secure key management for NASA space communication,Aruna Balasubramanian; Sumita Mishra; Ramalingam Sridhar,Abstract NASA envisions advanced technologies and protocols for their missions usingspace-based networks. The space-based network technology considers the ground stationsand the spacecrafts to be a part of one large network; where a spacecraft can potentiallyconnect to a large number of ground stations during its orbit. However; the technologyintroduces easy access to the spacecraft from the ground; in turn increasing the securityrisks. Additionally; space-based networks are formed among heterogeneous networkentities. Thus; a generic security solution for all communication components may not be wellsuited.

Uiwear: Easily adapting user interfaces for wearable devices,Jian Xu; Qingqing Cao; Aditya Prakash; Aruna Balasubramanian; Donald E Porter,Abstract Wearable devices such as smartwatches offer exciting new opportunities for usersto interact with their applications. However; the current wearable programming modelrequires the developer to write a custom companion app for each wearable form factor; thecompanion app extends the smartphone display onto the wearable; relays user interactionsfrom the wearable to the phone; and updates the wearable display as needed. Thedevelopment effort required to write a companion app is significant and will not scale to anincreasing diversity of form factors. This paper argues for a different programming model forwearable devices. The developer writes an application for the smartphone; but onlyspecifies a UI design for the wearable.

To address privacy and efficiency concerns; we showhow RNN models can be run locally on mobile devices.

Deconstructing the Energy Consumption of the Mobile Page Load,Yi Cao; Javad Nejati; Muhammad Wajahat; Aruna Balasubramanian; Anshul Gandhi,Abstract Modeling the energy consumption of applications on mobile devices is an importanttopic that has received much attention in recent years. However; there has been very littleresearch on modeling the energy consumption of the mobile Web. This is primarily due tothe short-lived yet complex page load process that makes it infeasible to rely on coarse-grained resource monitoring for accurate power estimation. We present RECON; a modelingapproach that accurately estimates the energy consumption of any Web page load anddeconstructs it into the energy contributions of individual page load activities. Our keyintuition is to leverage low-level application semantics in addition to coarse-grainedresource utilizations for modeling the page load energy consumption.

Analyzing the Power Consumption of the Mobile Page Load,Yi Cao; Javad Nejati; Pavan Maguluri; Aruna Balasubramanian; Anshul Gandhi,A large portion of today's Web traffic comes from mobiles devices. User experience of mobileWeb pages has become an important factor that content providers and service providerswant to improve. One metric for evaluating user experience is the mobile Web performance;specifically the page load time (PLT). While improving mobile Web performance has drawnincreasing attention [2]; most optimizations tend to overlook an important metric; energy. PLTand energy are distinct metrics; we observe in our experiments that these metrics may notalways be correlated. Given the importance of battery life for mobile users; we argue thatWeb page optimizations should also be evaluated for their impact on energy consumption.However; examining the energy effects of a Web optimization is challenging; even if one hasaccess to power monitors; for several reasons.
