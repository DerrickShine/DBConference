Holistic twig joins: optimal XML pattern matching,Nicolas Bruno; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract XML employs a tree-structured data model; and; naturally; XML queries specifypatterns of selection predicates on multiple elements related by a tree structure. Finding alloccurrences of such a twig pattern in an XML database is a core operation for XML queryprocessing. Prior work has typically decomposed the twig pattern into binary structural(parent-child and ancestor-descendant) relationships; and twig matching is achieved by:(i)using structural join algorithms to match the binary relationships against the XML database;and (ii) stitching together these basic matches. A limitation of this approach for matching twigpatterns is that intermediate result sizes can get large; even when the input and output sizesare more manageable. In this paper; we propose a novel holistic twig join algorithm;TwigStack; for matching an XML query twig pattern. Our technique uses a chain of linked …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,1306
Structural joins: A primitive for efficient XML query pattern matching,Shurug Al-Khalifa; HV Jagadish; Nick Koudas; Jignesh M Patel; Divesh Srivastava; Yuqing Wu,XML queries typically specify patterns of selection predicates on multiple elements that havesome specified tree structured relationships. The primitive tree structured relationships areparent-child and ancestor-descendant; and finding all occurrences of these relationships inan XML database is a core operation for XML query processing. We develop two families ofstructural join algorithms for this task: tree-merge and stack-tree. The tree-merge algorithmsare a natural extension of traditional merge joins and the multi-predicate merge joins; whilethe stack-tree algorithms have no counterpart in traditional relational join processing. Wepresent experimental results on a range of data and queries using the TIMBER native XMLquery engine built on top of SHORE. We show that while; in some cases; tree-mergealgorithms can have performance comparable to stack-tree algorithms; in many cases …,Data Engineering; 2002.

The system identifies emerging topics (ie'trends') on Twitter in real time and providesmeaningful analytics that synthesize an accurate description of each topic. Users interactwith the system by ordering the identified trends using different criteria and submitting theirown description for each trend.,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,776
Approximate string joins in a database (almost) for free,Luis Gravano; Panagiotis G Ipeirotis; Hosagrahar Visvesvaraya Jagadish; Nick Koudas; Shanmugauelayut Muthukrishnan; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract String data is ubiquitous; and its management has taken on particular importance inthe past few years. Approximate queries are very important on string data especially formore complex queries involving joins. This is due; for example; to the prevalence oftypographical errors in data; and multiple conventions for recording attributes such as nameand address. Commercial databases do not support approximate string joins directly; and itis a challenge to implement this functionality efficiently with user-defined functions (UDFs). Inthis paper; we develop a technique for building approximate string join capabilities on top ofcommercial databases by exploiting facilities already available in them. At the core; ourtechnique relies on matching short substrings of length а; called а-grams; and taking intoaccount both positions of individual matches and the total number of such matches.

Objectrank: Authority-based keyword search in databases,Andrey Balmin; Vagelis Hristidis; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract The ObjectRank system applies authority-based ranking to keyword search indatabases modeled as labeled graphs. Conceptually; authority originates at the nodes(objects) containing the keywords and flows to objects according to their semanticconnections. Each node is ranked according to its authority with respect to the particularkeywords. One can adjust the weight of global importance; the weight of each keyword of thequery; the importance of a result actually containing the keywords versus being referencedby nodes containing them; and the volume of authority flow via each type of semanticconnection. Novel performance challenges and opportunities are addressed. First; schemasimpose constraints on the graph; which are exploited for performance purposes. Second; inorder to address the issue of authority ranking with respect to the given keywords (as …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,607
Optimal histograms with quality guarantees,Hosagrahar Visvesvaraya Jagadish; Nick Koudas; S Muthukrishnan; Viswanath Poosala; Kenneth C Sevcik; Torsten Suel,Abstract Histograms are commonly used to capture attribute value distribution statistics forquery optimizers. More recently; histograms have also been considered as a way to producequick approximate answers to decision support queries. This widespread interest inhistograms motivates the problem of computing histograms that are good under a givenerror metric. In particular; we are interested in an e® cient algorithm for choosing the bucketboundaries in a way that either minimizes the estimation error for a given amount of space(number of buckets) or; conversely; minimizes the space needed for a given upper bound onthe error. Under the assumption that finding optimal bucket boundaries is computationallyine® cient; previous research has focused on heuristics with no provable bounds on thequality of the solutions. In this paper; we present algorithms for computing optimal bucket …,VLDB,1998,468
Monitoring k-nearest neighbor queries over moving objects,Xiaohui Yu; Ken Q Pu; Nick Koudas,Many location-based applications require constant monitoring of k-nearest neighbor (k-NN)queries over moving objects within a geographic area. Existing approaches to this problemhave focused on predictive queries; and relied on the assumption that the trajectories of theobjects are fully predictable at query processing time. We relax this assumption; andpropose two efficient and scalable algorithms using grid indices. One is based on indexingobjects; and the other on queries. For each approach; a cost model is developed; and adetailed analysis along with the respective applicability is presented. The object-indexingapproach is further extended to multi-levels to handle skewed data. We show byexperiments that our grid-based algorithms significantly outperform R-tree-based solutions.Extensive experiments are also carried out to study the properties and evaluate the …,Data Engineering; 2005.

Aggregate query answering on anonymized tables,Qing Zhang; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava; Ting Yu,Privacy is a serious concern when microdata need to be released for ad hoc analyses. Theprivacy goals of existing privacy protection approaches (eg; k-anonymity and l-diversity) aresuitable only for categorical sensitive attributes. Since applying them directly to numericalsensitive attributes (eg; salary) may result in undesirable information leakage; we proposeprivacy goals to better capture the need of privacy protection for numerical sensitiveattributes. Complementing the desire for privacy is the need to support ad hoc aggregateanalyses over microdata. Existing generalization-based anonymization approaches cannotanswer aggregate queries with reasonable accuracy. We present a general framework ofpermutation-based anonymization to support accurate answering of aggregate queries andshow that; for the same grouping; permutation-based techniques can always answer …,Data Engineering; 2007.

Data-streams and histograms,Sudipto Guha; Nick Koudas; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Histograms have been used widely to capture data distribution; to represent thedata by a small number of step functions. Dynamic programming algorithms which provideoptimal construction of these histograms exist; albeit running in quadratic time and linearspace. In this paper we provide linear time construction of 1+ &egr; approximation of optimalhistograms; running in polylogarithmic space. Our results extend to the context of data-streams; and in fact generalize to give 1+ &egr; approximation of several problems in data-streams which require partitioning the index set into intervals. The only assumptionsrequired are that the cost of an interval is monotonic under inclusion (larger interval haslarger cost) and that the cost can be computed or approximated in small space. This exhibitsa nice class of problems for which we can have near optimal data-stream algorithms.,Proceedings of the thirty-third annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,2001,346
PREFER: A system for the efficient execution of multi-parametric ranked queries,Vagelis Hristidis; Nick Koudas; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract Users often need to optimize the selection of objects by appropriately weighting theimportance of multiple object attributes. Such optimization problems appear often inoperations' research and applied mathematics as well as everyday life; eg; a buyer mayselect a home as a weighted function of a number of attributes like its distance from office; itsprice; its area; etc. We capture such queries in our definition of preference queries that use aweight function over a relation's attributes to derive a score for each tuple. Database systemscannot efficiently produce the top results of a preference query because they need toevaluate the weight function over all tuples of the relation. PREFER answers preferencequeries efficiently by using materialized views that have been pre-processed and stored.,ACM Sigmod Record,2001,345
Text joins in an RDBMS for web data integration,Luis Gravano; Panagiotis G Ipeirotis; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract The integration of data produced and collected across autonomous; heterogeneousweb services is an increasingly important and challenging problem. Due to the lack of globalidentifiers; the same entity (eg; a product) might have different textual representations acrossdatabases. Textual data is also often noisy because of transcription errors; incompleteinformation; and lack of standard formats. A fundamental task during data integration ismatching of strings that refer to the same entity. In this paper; we adopt the widely used andestablished cosine similarity metric from the information retrieval field in order to identifypotential string matches across web sources. We then use this similarity metric tocharacterize this key aspect of data integration as a join between relations on textualattributes; where the similarity of matches exceeds a specified threshold.

MRShare: sharing across multiple queries in MapReduce,Tomasz Nykiel; Michalis Potamias; Chaitanya Mishra; George Kollios; Nick Koudas,Abstract Large-scale data analysis lies in the core of modern enterprises and scientificresearch. With the emergence of cloud computing; the use of an analytical query processinginfrastructure (eg; Amazon EC2) can be directly mapped to monetary value. MapReduce hasbeen a popular framework in the context of cloud computing; designed to serve long runningqueries (jobs) which can be processed in batch mode. Taking into account that different jobsoften perform similar work; there are many opportunities for sharing. In principle; sharingsimilar work reduces the overall amount of work; which can lead to reducing monetarycharges incurred while utilizing the processing infrastructure. In this paper we propose asharing framework tailored to MapReduce.

Dynamic multidimensional histograms,Nitin Thaper; Sudipto Guha; Piotr Indyk; Nick Koudas,Abstract Histograms are a concise and flexible way to construct summary structures for largedata sets. They have attracted a lot of attention in database research due to their utility inmany areas; including query optimization; and approximate query answering. They are alsoa basic tool for data visualization and analysis. In this paper; we present a formal study ofdynamic multidimensional histogram structures over continuous data streams. At the heart ofour proposal is the use of a dynamic summary data structure (vastly different from ahistogram) maintaining a succinct approximation of the data distribution of the underlyingcontinuous stream. On demand; an accurate histogram is derived from this dynamic datastructure. We propose algorithms for extracting such an accurate histogram and we analyzetheir behavior and tradeoffs.

Keyword proximity search in XML trees,Vagelis Hristidis; Nick Koudas; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Divesh Srivastava,Recent works have shown the benefits of keyword proximity search in querying XMLdocuments in addition to text documents. For example; given query keywords overShakespeare's plays in XML; the user might be interested in knowing how the keywordscooccur. In this paper; we focus on XML trees and define XML keyword; proximity queries toreturn the (possibly heterogeneous) set of minimum connecting trees (MCTs) of the matchesto the individual keywords in the query. We consider efficiently executing keyword proximityqueries on labeled trees (XML) in various settings: 1) when the XML database has beenpreprocessed and 2) when no indices are available on the XML database. We perform adetailed experimental evaluation to study the benefits of our approach and show that ouralgorithms considerably outperform prior algorithms and other applicable approaches.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2006,241
Identifying representative trends in massive time series data sets using sketches,Piotr Indyk; Nick Koudas; S Muthukrishnan,Abstract Many data stores; including scientific and financial databases; businesswarehouses and network repositories; contain time series data. Time series data depicttrends for an observed value eg; value of a stock; number of bytes sent on a router interface;etc.; as a function of time. Analysis of the trends over different time windows is of greatinterest. In this paper; we formalize problems of identifying various" representative" trends intime series data. Informally; an interval of observations in a time series is defined to be arepresentative trend if its distance from other intervals satisfy certain properties; for suitablydefined distance functions between time series intervals. Natural trends of interest such asperiodic or average trends are examples of representative trends. We present efficientalgorithms for analyzing massive time series data sets for representative trends over …,VLDB,2000,232
Efficient biased sampling for approximate clustering and outlier detection in large data sets,George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Nick Koudas; Stefan Berchtold,We investigate the use of biased sampling according to the density of the data set to speedup the operation of general data mining tasks; such as clustering and outlier detection inlarge multidimensional data sets. In density-biased sampling; the probability that a givenpoint will be included in the sample depends on the local density of the data set. Wepropose a general technique for density-biased sampling that can factor in userrequirements to sample for properties of interest and can be tuned for specific data miningtasks. This allows great flexibility and improved accuracy of the results over simple randomsampling. We describe our approach in detail; we analytically evaluate it; and show how itcan be optimized for approximate clustering and outlier detection. Finally; we present athorough experimental evaluation of the proposed method; applying density-biased …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2003,198
Answering top-k queries using views,Gautam Das; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Nick Koudas; Dimitris Tsirogiannis,Abstract The problem of obtaining efficient answers to top-k queries has attracted a lot ofresearch attention. Several algorithms and numerous variants of the top-k retrieval problemhave been introduced in recent years. The general form of this problem requests the khighest ranked values from a relation; using monotone combining functions on (a subset of)its attributes. In this paper we explore space performance tradeoffs related to this problem. Inparticular we study the problem of answering top-k queries using views. A view in thiscontext is a materialized version of a previously posed query; requesting a number ofhighest ranked values according to some monotone combining function defined on a subsetof the attributes of a relation. Several problems of interest arise in the presence of suchviews. We start by presenting a new algorithm capable of combining the information from …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,190
Non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques for classification and visualization,Michail Vlachos; Carlotta Domeniconi; Dimitrios Gunopulos; George Kollios; Nick Koudas,Abstract In this paper we address the issue of using local embeddings for data visualizationin two and three dimensions; and for classification. We advocate their use on the basis thatthey provide an efficient mapping procedure from the original dimension of the data; to alower intrinsic dimension. We depict how they can accurately capture the user's perceptionof similarity in high-dimensional data for visualization purposes. Moreover; we exploit thelow-dimensional mapping provided by these embeddings; to develop new classificationtechniques; and we show experimentally that the classification accuracy is comparable(albeit using fewer dimensions) to a number of other classification procedures.,Proceedings of the eighth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2002,189
Approximate XML joins,Sudipto Guha; HV Jagadish; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava; Ting Yu,Abstract XML is widely recognized as the data interchange standard for tomorrow; becauseof its ability to represent data from a wide variety sources. Hence; XML is likely to be theformat through which data from multiple sources is integrated. In this paper we study theproblem of integrating XML data sources through correlations realized as join operations. Achallenging aspect of this operation is the XML document structure. Two documents mightconvey approximately or exactly the same information but may be quite different in structure.Consequently approximate match in structure; in addition to; content has to be folded in thejoin operation. We quantify approximate match in structure and content using well definednotions of distance. For structure; we propose computationally inexpensive lower and upperbounds for the tree edit distance metric between two trees. We then show how the tree …,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,189
Structure and content scoring for XML,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Nick Koudas; Amélie Marian; Divesh Srivastava; David Toman,Abstract XML repositories are usually queried both on structure and content. Due tostructural heterogeneity of XML; queries are often interpreted approximately and theiranswers are returned ranked by scores. Computing answer scores in XML is an active areaof research that oscillates between pure content scoring such as the well-known tf* idf andtaking structure into account. However; none of the existing proposals fully accounts forstructure and combines it with content to score query answers. We propose novel XMLscoring methods that are inspired by tf* idf and that account for both structure and contentwhile considering query relaxations. Twig scoring; accounts for the most structure andcontent and is thus used as our reference method. Path scoring is an approximation thatloosens correlations between query nodes hence reducing the amount of time required to …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,178

Our summary data structure scalablyrepresents approximate frequency information about twiglets (ie small twigs) in the data tree.Given a twig query; the number of matches is estimated by creating a set of query twiglets;and combining two complementary approaches: set hashing; used to estimate the number ofmatches of each query twiglet; and maximal overlap; used to combine the query twigletestimates into an estimate for the twig query. We propose several estimation algorithms thatapply these approaches on query twiglets formed using variations on different twiglet …,Data Engineering; 2001.

Size separation spatial join,Nick Koudas; Kenneth C Sevcik,Abstract We introduce a new algorithm to compute the spatial join of two or more spatial datasets; when indexes are not available on them. Size Separation Spatial Join (S 3 J) imposesa hierarchical decomposition of the data space and; in contrast with previous approaches;requires no replication of entities from the input data sets. Thus its execution time dependsonly on the sizes of the joined data sets. We describe S 3 J and present an analyticalevaluation of its I/O and processor requirements comparing them with those of previouslyproposed algorithms for the same problem. We show that S 3 J has relatively simple costestimation formulas that can be exploited by a query optimizer. S 3 J can be efficientlyimplemented using software already present in many relational systems. In addition; weintroduce Dynamic Spatial Bitmaps (DSB); a new technique that enables S 3 J to …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1997,159

Mining Deviants in a Time Series Database.,HV Jagadish; Nick Koudas; S Muthukrishnan,Abstract Identifying outliers is an important data analysis function. Statisticians have longstudied techniques to identify outliers in a data set in the context of fitting the data to somemodel. In the case of time series data; the situation is more murky. For instance; the" typical"value could" drift" up or down over time; so the extrema may not necessarily be interesting.We wish to identify data points that are somehow anomalous or" surprising". We formallydefine the notion of a deviant in a time series; based on a representation sparsity metric. Wedevelop an efficient algorithm to identify deviants in a time series. We demonstrate how thistechnique can be used to locate interesting artifacts in time series data; and presentexperimental evidence of the value of our technique.

Approximating a data stream for querying and estimation: Algorithms and performance evaluation,Sudipto Guha; Nick Koudas,Obtaining fast and good-quality approximations to data distributions is a problem of centralinterest to database management. A variety of popular database applications; includingapproximate querying; similarity searching and data mining in most application domains;rely on such good-quality approximations. Histogram-based approximation is a very popularmethod in database theory and practice to succinctly represent a data distribution in a space-efficient manner. In this paper; we place the problem of histogram construction intoperspective and we generalize it by raising the requirement of a finite data set and/or knowndata set size. We consider the case of an infinite data set in which data arrive continuously;forming an infinite data stream. In this context; we present single-pass algorithms that arecapable of constructing histograms of provable good quality. We present algorithms for …,Data Engineering; 2002.

Navigation-vs. index-based XML multi-query processing,Nicolas Bruno; Luis Gravano; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,XML path queries form the basis of complex filtering of XML data. Most current XML pathquery processing techniques can be divided in two groups. Navigation-based algorithmscompute results by analyzing an input document one tag at a time. In contrast; index-basedalgorithms take advantage of precomputed numbering schemes over the input XMLdocument. We introduce a new index-based technique; index-filter; to answer multiple XMLpath queries. Index-filter uses indexes built over the document tags to avoid processinglarge portions of the input document that are guaranteed not to be part of any match. Weanalyze index-filter and compare it against Y-filter; a state-of-the-art navigation-basedtechnique. We show that both techniques have their advantages; and we discuss thescenarios under which each technique is superior to the other one. In particular; we show …,Data Engineering; 2003.

Space efficient bitmap indexing,Nick Koudas,Abstract There exists a well known tradeoff between the performance of queries on acollection of tables and the space devoted to the indices indexing the attributes in thesetables. We introduce additional parameters in the analysis of this tradeoff namely the queryand data distribution on the attribute instance. We propose a technique to index largecardinality attributes using bitmaps taking into account both the query and data distributionof the attribute instance; as well as the space requirements of the bitmaps. We formulate thisproblem in mathematical terms and we propose optimal algorithms for its solution.

Declustering spatial databases on a multi-computer architecture,Nikos Koudas; Christos Faloutsos; Ibrahim Kamel,Abstract We present a technique to decluster a spatial access method on a shared-nothingmulti-computer architecture [DGS+ 90]. We propose a software architecture with the R-treeas the underlying spatial access method; with its non-leaf levels on the 'master-server'and itsleaf nodes distributed across the servers. The major contribution of our work is the study ofthe optimal capacity of leaf nodes; or 'chunk size'(or 'striping unit'): we express the responsetime on range queries as a function of the 'chunk size'; and we show how to optimize it. Weimplemented our method on a network of workstations; using a real dataset; and wecompared the experimental and the theoretical results. The conclusion is that our formula forthe response time is very accurate (the maximum relative error was 29%; the typical errorwas in the vicinity of 10–15%).

Merging the results of approximate match operations,Sudipto Guha; Nick Koudas; Amit Marathe; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract Data Cleaning is an important process that has been at the center of researchinterest in recent years. An important end goal of effective data cleaning is to identify therelational tuple or tuples that are" most related" to a given query tuple. Various techniqueshave been proposed in the literature for efficiently identifying approximate matches to aquery string against a single attribute of a relation. In addition to constructing a ranking (ie;ordering) of these matches; the techniques often associate; with each match; scores thatquantify the extent of the match. Since multiple attributes could exist in the query tuple;issuing approximate match operations for each of them separately will effectively create anumber of ranked lists of the relation tuples. Merging these lists to identify a final ranking andscoring; and returning the top-K tuples; is a challenging task.

Adaptive processing of top-k queries in XML,Amelie Marian; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,The ability to compute top-k matches to XML queries is gaining importance due to theincreasing number of large XML repositories. The efficiency of top-k query evaluation relieson using scores to prune irrelevant answers as early as possible in the evaluation process.In this context; evaluating the same query plan for all answers might be too rigid because; atany time in the evaluation; answers have gone through the same number and sequence ofoperations; which limits the speed at which scores grow. Therefore; adaptive queryprocessing that permits different plans for different partial matches and maximizes the bestscores is more appropriate. In this paper; we propose an architecture and adaptivealgorithms for efficiently computing top-k matches to XML queries. Our techniques can beused to evaluate both exact and approximate matches where approximation is defined by …,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005. Proceedings. 21st International Conference on,2005,115
Flexible string matching against large databases in practice,Nick Koudas; Amit Marathe; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract Data Cleaning is an important process that has been at the center of researchinterest in recent years. Poor data quality is the result of a variety of reasons; including dataentry errors and multiple conventions for recording database fields; and has a significantimpact on a variety of business issues. Hence; there is a pressing need for technologies thatenable flexible (fuzzy) matching of string information in a database. Cosine similarity with tf-idf is a well-established metric for comparing text; and recent proposals have adapted thissimilarity measure for flexibly matching a query string with values in a single attribute of arelation. In deploying tf-idf based flexible string matching against real AT&T databases; weobserved that this technique needed to be enhanced in many ways.

Fast indexes and algorithms for set similarity selection queries,Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Amit Chandel; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,Data collections often have inconsistencies that arise due to a variety of reasons; and it isdesirable to be able to identify and resolve them efficiently. Set similarity queries arecommonly used in data cleaning for matching similar data. In this work we concentrate onset similarity selection queries: Given a query set; retrieve all sets in a collection withsimilarity greater than some threshold. Various set similarity measures have been proposedin the past for data cleaning purposes. In this work we concentrate on weighted similarityfunctions like TF/IDF; and introduce variants that are well suited for set similarity selections ina relational database context. These variants have special semantic properties that can beexploited to design very efficient index structures and algorithms for answering queriesefficiently.

Approximation and streaming algorithms for histogram construction problems,Sudipto Guha; Nick Koudas; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Histograms and related synopsis structures are popular techniques forapproximating data distributions. These have been successful in query optimization and avariety of applications; including approximate querying; similarity searching; and datamining; to name a few. Histograms were a few of the earliest synopsis structures proposedand continue to be used widely. The histogram construction problem is to construct the besthistogram restricted to a space bound that reflects the data distribution most accuratelyunder a given error measure. The histograms are used as quick and easy estimates. Thus; aslight loss of accuracy; compared to the optimal histogram under the given error measure;can be offset by fast histogram construction algorithms. A natural question arises in thiscontext: Can we find a fast near optimal approximation algorithm for the histogram …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2006,111
High dimensional similarity joins: Algorithms and performance evaluation,Nick Koudas; Kenneth C Sevcik,Current data repositories include a variety of data types; including audio; images; and timeseries. State-of-the-art techniques for indexing such data and doing query processing relyon a transformation of data elements into points in a multidimensional feature space.Indexing and query processing then take place in the feature space. We study algorithms forfinding relationships among points in multidimensional feature spaces; specificallyalgorithms for multidimensional joins. Like joins of conventional relations; correlationsbetween multidimensional feature spaces can offer valuable information about the data setsinvolved. We present several algorithmic paradigms for solving the multidimensional joinproblem and we discuss their features and limitations.

When considering relaxing a query condition; intuitively one seeksthe'minimal'amount of relaxation that yields an answer. We first characterize the types ofanswers that we return to relaxed queries. We then propose a lattice based framework inorder to aid query relaxation. Nodes in the lattice correspond to different ways to relaxqueries. We characterize the properties of relaxation at each node and present algorithms tocompute the corresponding answer. We then discuss how to traverse this lattice in a waythat a non-empty query answer is obtained with the minimum amount of query conditionrelaxation. We implemented this framework and we present our results of a thorough …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,108
Multiple aggregations over data streams,Rui Zhang; Nick Koudas; Beng Chin Ooi; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract Monitoring aggregates on IP traffic data streams is a compelling application for datastream management systems. The need for exploratory IP traffic data analysis naturallyleads to posing related aggregation queries on data streams; that differ only in the choice ofgrouping attributes. In this paper; we address this problem of efficiently computing multipleaggregations over high speed data streams; based on a two-level LFTA/HFTA DSMSarchitecture; inspired by Gigascope. Our first contribution is the insight that in such ascenario; additionally computing and maintaining fine-granularity aggregation queries(phantoms) at the LFTA has the benefit of supporting shared computation. Our secondcontribution is an investigation into the problem of identifying beneficial LFTA configurationsof phantoms and user-queries. We formulate this problem as a cost optimization problem …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,108
Ranked join indices,Panayiotis Tsaparas; Themistoklis Palpanas; Yannis Kotidis; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,A plethora of data sources contain data entities that could be ordered according to a varietyof attributes associated with the entities. Such orderings result effectively in a ranking of theentities according to the values in the attribute domain. Commonly; users correlate suchsources for query processing purposes through join operations. In query processing; it isdesirable to incorporate user preferences towards specific attributes or their values. A way toincorporate such preferences is by utilizing scoring functions that combine user preferencesand attribute values and return a numerical score for each tuple in the join result. Then; atarget query; which we refer to as top-k join query; seeks to identify the k tuples in the joinresult with the highest scores. We propose a novel technique; which we refer to as rankedjoin index; to efficiently answer top-k join queries for arbitrary; user specified; preferences …,Data Engineering; 2003.

Query by document,Yin Yang; Nilesh Bansal; Wisam Dakka; Panagiotis Ipeirotis; Nick Koudas; Dimitris Papadias,Abstract We are experiencing an unprecedented increase of content contributed by users inforums such as blogs; social networking sites and microblogging services. Such abundanceof content complements content on web sites and traditional media forums such as newspapers; news and financial streams; and so on. Given such plethora of information there is apressing need to cross reference information across textual services. For example;commonly we read a news item and we wonder if there are any blogs reporting relatedcontent or vice versa. In this paper; we present techniques to automate the process of crossreferencing online information content. We introduce methodologies to extract phrases froma given" query document" to be used as queries to search interfaces with the goal to retrievecontent related to the query document. In particular; we consider two techniques to extract …,Proceedings of the Second ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2009,98
Efficient diversity-aware search,Albert Angel; Nick Koudas,Abstract Typical approaches of ranking information in response to a user's query that returnthe most relevant results ignore important factors contributing to user satisfaction; forinstance; the contents of a result document may be redundant given the results alreadyexamined. Motivated by emerging applications; in this work we study the problem ofDiversity-Aware Search; the essence of which is ranking search results based on both theirrelevance; as well as their dissimilarity to other results reported. Diversity-Aware Search isgenerally a hard problem; and even tractable instances thereof cannot be efficiently solvedby adapting existing approaches. We propose DIVGEN; an efficient algorithm for diversity-aware search; which achieves significant performance improvements via novel data accessprimitives. Although selecting the optimal schedule of data accesses is a hard problem …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,96
Ad-hoc top-k query answering for data streams,Gautam Das; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Nick Koudas; Nikos Sarkas,Abstract A top-k query retrieves the k highest scoring tuples from a data set with respect to ascoring function defined on the attributes of a tuple. The efficient evaluation of top-k querieshas been an active research topic and many different instantiations of the problem; in avariety of settings; have been studied. However; techniques developed for conventional;centralized or distributed databases are not directly applicable to highly dynamicenvironments and on-line applications; like data streams. Recently; techniques supportingtop-k queries on data streams have been introduced. Such techniques are restrictivehowever; as they can only efficiently report top-k answers with respect to a pre-specified (asopposed to ad-hoc) set of queries. In this paper we introduce a novel geometricrepresentation for the top-k query problem that allows us to raise this restriction.

Approximate NN queries on streams with guaranteed error/performance bounds,Nick Koudas; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Rui Zhang,Abstract In data stream applications; data arrive continuously and can only be scanned onceas the query processor has very limited memory (relative to the size of the stream) to workwith. Hence; queries on data streams do not have access to the entire data set and queryanswers are typically approximate. While there have been many studies on the k NearestNeighbors (kNN) problem in conventional multi-dimensional databases; the solutionscannot be directly applied to data streams for the above reasons. In this paper; weinvestigate the kNN problem over data streams. We first introduce the e-approximate kNN(ekNN) problem that finds the approximate kNN answers of a query point Q such that theabsolute error of the k-th nearest neighbor distance is bounded by e. To support ekNNqueries over streams; we propose a technique called DISC (aDaptive Indexing on …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,90
Dense subgraph maintenance under streaming edge weight updates for real-time story identification,Albert Angel; Nikos Sarkas; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract Recent years have witnessed an unprecedented proliferation of social media.People around the globe author; every day; millions of blog posts; micro-blog posts; socialnetwork status updates; etc. This rich stream of information can be used to identify; on anongoing basis; emerging stories; and events that capture popular attention. Stories can beidentified via groups of tightly-coupled real-world entities; namely the people; locations;products; etc.; that are involved in the story. The sheer scale; and rapid evolution of the datainvolved necessitate highly efficient techniques for identifying important stories at every pointof time. The main challenge in real-time story identification is the maintenance of densesubgraphs (corresponding to groups of tightly-coupled entities) under streaming edgeweight updates (resulting from a stream of user-generated content).

The threshold join algorithm for top-k queries in distributed sensor networks,Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti; Zografoula Vagena; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vana Kalogeraki; V Tsotras; Michail Vlachos; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract In this paper we present the Threshold Join Algorithm (TJA); which is an efficientTOP-k query processing algorithm for distributed sensor networks. The objective of a top-kquery is to find the k highest ranked answers to a user defined similarity function. Theevaluation of such a query in a sensor network environment is associated with the transfer ofdata over an extremely expensive communication medium. TJA uses a non-uniformthreshold on the queried attribute in order to minimize the number of tuples that have to betransferred towards the querying node. Additionally; TJA resolves queries in the networkrather than in a centralized fashion; which minimizes even more the consumption ofbandwidth and delay. Our preliminary experimental results; using our trace driven simulator;show that TJA is both practical and efficient.,Proceedings of the 2nd international workshop on Data management for sensor networks,2005,87
Correlating synchronous and asynchronous data streams,Sudipto Guha; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Nick Koudas,Abstract In a variety of modern mining applications; data are commonly viewed as infinitetime ordered data streams rather as finite data sets stored on disk. This view challengesfundamental assumptions commonly made in the context of several data mining algorithms.In this paper; we study the problem of identifying correlations between multiple data streams.In particular; we propose algorithms capable of capturing correlations between multiplecontinuous data streams in a highly efficient and accurate manner. Our algorithms andtechniques are applicable in the case of both synchronous and asynchronous datastreaming environments. We capture correlations between multiple streams using the wellknown technique of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Correlations between data items;and the SVD technique in particular; have been repeatedly utilized in an off-line (non …,Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2003,85
Seeking stable clusters in the blogosphere,Nilesh Bansal; Fei Chiang; Nick Koudas; Frank Wm Tompa,Abstract The popularity of blogs has been increasing dramatically over the last couple ofyears. As topics evolve in the blogosphere; keywords align together and form the heart ofvarious stories. Intuitively we expect that in certain contexts; when there is a lot of discussionon a specific topic or event; a set of keywords will be correlated: the keywords in the set willfrequently appear together (pair-wise or in conjunction) forming a cluster. Note that suchkeyword clusters are temporal (associated with specific time periods) and transient. Astopics recede; associated keyword clusters dissolve; because their keywords no longerappear frequently together. In this paper; we formalize this intuition and present efficientalgorithms to identify keyword clusters in large collections of blog posts for specific temporalintervals. We then formalize problems related to the temporal properties of such clusters …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,84
On effective multi-dimensional indexing for strings,HV Jagadish; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract As databases have expanded in scope from storing purely business data to includeXML documents; product catalogs; e-mail messages; and directory data; it has becomeincreasingly important to search databases based on wild-card string matching: prefixmatching; for example; is more common (and useful) than exact matching; for such data. Inmany cases; matches need to be on multiple attributes/dimensions; with correlationsbetween the dimensions. Traditional multi-dimensional index structures; designed with(fixed length) numeric data in mind; are not suitable for matching unbounded length stringdata. In this paper; we describe a general technique for adapting a multi-dimensional indexstructure for wild-card indexing of unbounded length string data. The key ideas are (a) acarefully developed mapping function from strings to rational numbers;(b) representing an …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2000,79
Optimal histograms for hierarchical range queries,Nick Koudas; S Muthukrishnan; Divesh Srivastava,Now there is tremendous interest in data warehousing and OLAP applications. OLAPapplications typically view data as having multiple logical dimensions eg; product; locationwith natural hierarchies defined on each dimension; and analyze the behavior of variousmeasure attributes eg; sales; volume in terms of the dimensions. OLAP queries typicallyinvolve hierarchical selections on some of the dimensions eg; product is classified under thejeans product category; or location is in the north-east region; often aggregating measureattributes see; eg; 6. Cost-based query optimization of such OLAP queries needs goodestimates of the selectivity of hierarchical selections. Histograms capture attribute valuedistribution statistics in a space-e cient fashion. They have been designed to work well fornumeric attribute value domains; and have long been used to support cost-based query …,Proceedings of the nineteenth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2000,75
Routing XML queries,Nick Koudas; Michael Rabinovich; Divesh Srivastava; Ting Yu,In file-sharing P2P networks; a fundamental problem is that of identifying databases that arerelevant to user queries. This problem is referred to as the location problem in P2P literature.We propose a scalable solution to the location problem in a data-sharing P2P network;consisting of a network of XML database nodes and XML router nodes; and make thefollowing contributions. We develop the internal organization and routing protocols for theXML router nodes; to enable scalable XPath query and update processing; under the openand the agreement cooperation models between nodes. Since router nodes tend to bememory constrained; we facilitate a space/performance tradeoff by permitting aggregatedrouting states; and developing algorithms for generating and using such aggregatedinformation.

Interactive query refinement,Chaitanya Mishra; Nick Koudas,Abstract We investigate the problem of refining SQL queries to satisfy cardinality constraintson the query result. This has applications to the many/few answers problems often faced bydatabase users. We formalize the problem of query refinement and propose a framework tosupport it in a database system. We introduce an interactive model of refinement thatincorporates user feedback to best capture user preferences. Our techniques are designedto handle queries having range and equality predicates on numerical and categoricalattributes. We present an experimental evaluation of our framework implemented in an opensource data manager and demonstrate the feasibility and practical utility of our approach.,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,73
Group linkage,Byung-Won On; Nick Koudas; Dongwon Lee; Divesh Srivastava,Poor quality data is prevalent in databases due to a variety of reasons; includingtranscription errors; lack of standards for recording database fields; etc. To be able to queryand integrate such data; considerable recent work has focused on the record linkageproblem; ie; determine if two entities represented as relational records are approximately thesame. Often entities are represented as groups of relational records; rather than individualrelational records; eg; households in a census survey consist of a group of persons. We referto the problem of determining if two entities represented as groups are approximately thesame as group linkage. Intuitively; two groups can be linked to each other if (i) there is highenough similarity between" matching" pairs of individual records that constitute the twogroups; and (ii) there is a large fraction of such matching record pairs.

Selectively estimation for boolean queries,Zhiyuan Chen; Nick Koudas; Flip Korn; S Muthukrishnan,Abstract In a variety of applications ranging from optimizing queries on alphanumericattributes to providing approximate counts of documents containing several query terms;there is an increasing need to quickly and reliably estimate the number of strings (tuples;documents; etc.) matching a Boolean query. Boolean queries in this context consist ofsubstring predicates composed using Boolean operators. While there has been some workin estimating the selectivity of substring queries; the more general problem of estimating theselectivity of Boolean queries over substring predicates has not been studied. Our approachis to extract selectivity estimates from relationships between the substring predicates of theBoolean query. However; storing the correlation between all possible predicates in order toprovide an exact answer to such predicates is clearly infeasible; as there is a super …,Proceedings of the nineteenth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2000,73
Text joins for data cleansing and integration in an rdbms,Luis Gravano; Panagiotis G Ipeirotis; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,An organization's data records are often noisy because of transcription errors; incompleteinformation; lack of standard formats for textual data or combinations thereof. A fundamentaltask in a data cleaning system is matching textual attributes that refer to the same entity (eg;organization name or address). This matching is effectively performed via the cosinesimilarity metric from the information retrieval field. For robustness and scalability; these" textjoins" are best done inside an RDBMS; which is where the data is likely to reside.Unfortunately; computing an exact answer to a text join can be expensive. We propose anapproximate; sampling-based text join execution strategy that can be robustly executed in astandard; unmodified RDBMS.,Data Engineering; 2003.

Multidimensional substring selectivity estimation using set hashing of cross-counts,*,An approach for multidimensional substring selectivity estimation utilizes set hashing togenerate cross-counts as needed; instead of storing cross-counts for the most frequently co-occurring substrings. Set hashing is a Monte Carlo technique that is used to succinctlyrepresent the set of tuples containing a given substring. Then; any combination of sethashes will yield a cross-count when intersected. Thus; the set hashing technique is usefulin three-; four-and other multidimensional situations; since only an intersection function isrequired.,*,2004,65
Sampling online social networks,Manos Papagelis; Gautam Das; Nick Koudas,As online social networking emerges; there has been increased interest to utilize theunderlying network structure as well as the available information on social peers to improvethe information needs of a user. In this paper; we focus on improving the performance ofinformation collection from the neighborhood of a user in a dynamic social network. Weintroduce sampling-based algorithms to efficiently explore a user's social network respectingits structure and to quickly approximate quantities of interest. We introduce and analyzevariants of the basic sampling scheme exploring correlations across our samples. Models ofcentralized and distributed social networks are considered. We show that our algorithms canbe utilized to rank items in the neighborhood of a user; assuming that information for eachuser in the network is available.

Metric functional dependencies,Nick Koudas; Avishek Saha; Divesh Srivastava; Suresh Venkatasubramanian,When merging data from various sources; it is often the case that small variations in dataformat and interpretation cause traditional functional dependencies (FDs) to be violated;without there being an intrinsic violation of semantics. Examples include differing addressformats; or different reported latitude/longitudes for a given address. In this paper; we definemetric functional dependencies; which strictly generalize traditional FDs by allowing smalldifferences (controlled by a metric) in values of the consequent attribute of an FD. Wepresent efficient algorithms for the verification problem: determining whether a given metricFD holds for a given relation. We experimentally demonstrate the validity and efficiency ofour approach on various data sets that lie in multidimensional spaces.,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09.

Efficient and tumble similar set retrieval,Aristides Gionis; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Nick Koudas,Abstract Set value attributes are a concise and natural way to model complex data sets.Modern Object Relational systems support set value attributes and allow various querycapabilities on them. In this paper we initiate a formal study of indexing techniques for setvalue attributes based on similarity; for suitably defined notions of similarity between sets.Such techniques are necessary in modern applications such as recommendations throughcollaborative filtering and automated advertising. Our techniques are probabilistic andapproximate in nature. As a design principle we create structures that make use of wellknown and widely used data structuring techniques; as a means to ease integration withexisting infrastructure. We show how the problem of indexing a collection of sets based onsimilarity can be reduced to the problem of indexing suitably encoded (in a way that …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,59
Anytime measures for top-k algorithms,Benjamin Arai; Gautam Das; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Nick Koudas,Abstract Top-k queries on large multi-attribute data sets are fundamental operations ininformation retrieval and ranking applications. In this paper; we initiate research on theanytime behavior of top-k algorithms. In particular; given specific top-k algorithms (TA andTA-Sorted) we are interested in studying their progress toward identification of the correctresult at any point during the algorithms' execution. We adopt a probabilistic approachwhere we seek to report at any point of operation of the algorithm the confidence that the top-k result has been identified. Such a functionality can be a valuable asset when one isinterested in reducing the runtime cost of top-k computations.

Benchmarking declarative approximate selection predicates,Amit Chandel; Oktie Hassanzadeh; Nick Koudas; Mohammad Sadoghi; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract Declarative data quality has been an active research topic. The fundamentalprinciple behind a declarative approach to data quality is the use of declarative statementsto realize data quality primitives on top of any relational data source. A primary advantage ofsuch an approach is the ease of use and integration with existing applications. Over the lastfew years several similarity predicates have been proposed for common quality primitives(approximate selections; joins; etc) and have been fully expressed using declarative SQLstatements. In this paper we propose new similarity predicates along with their declarativerealization; based on notions of probabilistic information retrieval. In particular we show howlanguage models and hidden Markov models can be utilized as similarity predicates for dataquality and present their full declarative instantiation.

In this paper; we initiate a study ofstreaming categorical skylines. We identify the limitations of existing work for offlinecategorical skyline computation and realize novel techniques for the problem of maintainingthe skyline of categorical data in a streaming environment. In particular; we develop alightweight data structure for indexing the tuples in the streaming buffer; that can gracefullyadapt to tuples with many attributes and partially ordered domains of any size andcomplexity.

Index structures for matching XML twigs using relational query processors,Zhiyuan Chen; Johannes Gehrke; Flip Korn; Nick Koudas; Jayavel Shanmugasundaram; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract Various index structures have been proposed to speed up the evaluation of XMLpath expressions. However; existing XML path indices suffer from at least one of threelimitations: they focus only on indexing the structure (relying on a separate index for nodecontent); they are useful only for simple path expressions such as root-to-leaf paths; or theycannot be tightly integrated with a relational query processor. Moreover; there is no unifiedframework to compare these index structures. In this paper; we present a framework defininga family of index structures that includes most existing XML path indices. We also proposetwo novel index structures in this family; with different space–time tradeoffs; that are effectivefor the evaluation of XML branching path expressions (ie; twigs) with value conditions.

In this work we concentrateon the class of weighted similarity measures (eg; TF/IDF and BM25 cosine similarity andvariants) and design selectivity estimators based on a priori constructed samples. First; westudy the pitfalls associated with straightforward applications of random sampling; and arguethat care needs to be taken in how the samples are constructed; uniform random samplingyields very low accuracy; while query sensitive realtime sampling is more expensive thanexact solutions (both in CPU and I/O cost).

Ldc: Enabling search by partial distance in a hyper-dimensional space,Nick Koudas; Beng Chin Ooi; Heng Tao Shen; Anthony KH Tung,Recent advances in research fields like multimedia and bioinformatics have brought about anew generation of hyper-dimensional databases which can contain hundreds or eventhousands of dimensions. Such hyper-dimensional databases pose significant problems toexisting high-dimensional indexing techniques which have been developed for indexingdatabases with (commonly) less than a hundred dimensions. To support efficient queryingand retrieval on hyper-dimensional databases; we propose a methodology called localdigital coding (LDC) which can support k-nearest neighbors (KNN) queries on hyper-dimensional databases and yet co-exist with ubiquitous indices; such as B+-trees.

Similarity search: A matching based approach,Anthony KH Tung; Rui Zhang; Nick Koudas; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract Similarity search is a crucial task in multimedia retrieval and data mining. Mostexisting work has modelled this problem as the nearest neighbor (NN) problem; whichconsiders the distance between the query object and the data objects over a fixed set offeatures. Such an approach has two drawbacks: 1) it leaves many partial similaritiesuncovered; 2) the distance is often affected by a few dimensions with high dissimilarity. Toovercome these drawbacks; we propose the kn-match problem in this paper. The kn-matchproblem models similarity search as matching between the query object and the dataobjects in n dimensions; where n is a given integer smaller than dimensionality d and thesen dimensions are determined dynamically to make the query object and the data objectsreturned in the answer set match best. The kn-match query is expected to be superior to …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,49

Using datacube aggregates for approximate querying and deviation detection,Themis Palpanas; Nick Koudas; Alberto Mendelzon,Much research has been devoted to the efficient computation of relational aggregations and;specifically; the efficient execution of the datacube operation. In this paper; we consider theinverse problem; that of deriving (approximately) the original data from the aggregates. Wemotivate this problem in the context of two specific application areas; approximate queryanswering and data analysis. We propose a framework based on the notion of informationentropy that enables us to estimate the original values in a data set; given only aggregatedinformation about it. We then show how approximate queries on the data from which theaggregates were derived can be performed using our framework. We also describe analternate use of the proposed framework that enables us to identify values that deviate fromthe underlying data distribution; suitable for data mining purposes.

Fast mining of massive tabular data via approximate distance computations,Graham Cormode; Piotr Indyk; Nick Koudas; S Muthukrishnan,Tabular data abound in many data stores: traditional relational databases store tables; andnew applications also generate massive tabular datasets. We present methods fordetermining similar regions in massive tabular data. Our methods are for computing the"distance" between any two subregions of tabular data: they are approximate; but highlyaccurate as we prove mathematically; and they are fast; running in time nearly linear in thetable size. Our methods are general since these distance computations can be applied toany mining or similarity algorithms that use L/sub p/norms. A novelty of our distancecomputation procedures is that they work for any L/sub p/norms; not only the traditional p= 2or p= 1; but for all p/spl les/2; the choice of p; say fractional p; provides an interestingalternative similarity behavior!

-A System for Keyword Proximity Search on XML Databases,Andrey Balmin; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Vagelis Hristidis; Tianqiu Wang; Divesh Srivastava; Nick Koudas,This chapter discusses keyword proximity search on XML database. Keyword proximitysearch is a user-friendly information discovery technique that has been extensively studiedfor text documents. In extending this technique to structured databases; recent works providekeyword proximity search on labeled graphs. A keyword proximity search does not requirethe user to know the structure of the graph; the role of the objects containing the keywords;or the type of the connections between the objects. The user simply submits a list ofkeywords and the system returns the sub-graphs that connect the objects containing thekeywords. XML and its labeled graph/tree abstractions are becoming the data model ofchoice for representing semistructured; self-describing data; and keyword proximity searchis well-suited to XML documents as well.A System for Keyword Proximity Search on XML …,*,2003,45
Efficient identification of starters and followers in social media,Michael Mathioudakis; Nick Koudas,Abstract Activity and user engagement in social media such as web logs; wikis; onlineforums or social networks has been increasing at unprecedented rates. In relation to socialbehavior in various human activities; user activity in social media indicates the existence ofindividuals that consistently drive or stimulate'discussions' in the online world. Suchindividuals are considered as' starters' of online discussions in contrast with'followers' thatprimarily engage in discussions and follow them. In this paper; we formalize notionsof'starters' and'followers' in social media. Motivated by the challenging size of the availableinformation related to online social behavior; we focus on the development of randomsampling approaches allowing us to achieve significant efficiency while identifying startersand followers.

Incremental maintenance of length normalized indexes for approximate string matching,Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract Approximate string matching is a problem that has received a lot of attentionrecently. Existing work on information retrieval has concentrated on a variety of similaritymeasures TF/IDF; BM25; HMM; etc.) specifically tailored for document retrieval purposes. Asnew applications that depend on retrieving short strings are becoming popular (eg; localsearch engines like YellowPages. com; Yahoo! Local; and Google Maps) new indexingmethods are needed; tailored for short strings. For that purpose; a number of indexingtechniques and related algorithms have been proposed based on length normalizedsimilarity measures. A common denominator of indexes for length normalized measures isthat maintaining the underlying structures in the presence of incremental updates isinefficient; mainly due to data dependent; precomputed weights associated with each …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,43
Improving the performance of list intersection,Dimitris Tsirogiannis; Sudipto Guha; Nick Koudas,Abstract List intersection is a central operation; utilized excessively for query processing ontext and databases. We present list intersection algorithms for an arbitrary number of sortedand unsorted lists tailored to the characteristics of modern hardware architectures. Two newlist intersection algorithms are presented for sorted lists. The first algorithm; termed DynamicProbes; dynamically decides the probing order on the lists exploiting information fromprevious probes at runtime. This information is utilized as a cache-resident microindex. Thesecond algorithm; termed Quantile-based; deduces in advance a good probing order; thusavoiding the overhead of adaptivity and is based on detecting lists with non-uniformdistribution of document identifiers. For unsorted lists; we present a novel hash-basedalgorithm that avoids the overhead of sorting.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,42

The wealth of information produced byindividuals from different geographical locations presents a challenging task of intelligentprocessing. In this paper; we introduce a methodology to identify notable geographicallyfocused events out of this collection of user generated information. At the heart of ourproposal lie efficient algorithms that identify geographically focused information bursts;attribute them to demographic factors and identify sets of descriptive keywords. We presentthe results of a prototype evaluation of our algorithms on BlogScope; a large-scale socialmedia warehousing platform.

Generating targeted queries for database testing,Chaitanya Mishra; Nick Koudas; Calisto Zuzarte,Abstract Tools for generating test queries for databases do not explicitly take into accountthe actual data in the database. As a consequence; such tools cannot guarantee suitablecoverage of test cases commonly required for database testing. In this paper; we investigatethe problem of generating queries that satisfy cardinality constraints on intermediatesubexpressions when executed on a given test database. Such queries are required to testthe performance of a database system under different operating conditions.

Fast algorithms for hierarchical range histogram construction,Sudipto Guha; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract Data Warehousing and OLAP applications typically view data an having multiplelogical dimensions (eg; product; location) with natural hierarchies defined on eachdimension. OLAP queries usually involve hierarchical selections on some of the dimensions;and often aggregate measure attributes (eg; sales; volume). Accurately estimating thedistribution of measure attributes; under hierarchical selections; is important in a variety ofscenarios; including approximate query evaluation and cost-based optimization of queries.In this paper; we propose fast (near linear time) algorithms for the problem of approximatingthe distribution of measure attributes with hierarchies defined on them; using histograms.Our algorithms are based on dynamic programming and a novel notion of sparse intervalsthat we introduce; and are the first practical algorithms for this problem.

Ranking objects based on relationships and fixed associations,Albert Angel; Surajit Chaudhuri; Gautam Das; Nick Koudas,Abstract Text corpora are often enhanced by additional metadata which relate real-worldentities; with each document in which such entities are discussed. Such relationships aretypically obtained through widely available Information Extraction tools. At the same time;interesting known associations typically hold among these entities. For instance; a corpusmight contain discussions on hotels; cities and airlines; fixed associations among theseentities may include: airline A operates a flight to city C; hotel H is located in city C. Aplethora of applications necessitate the identification of associated entities; each bestmatching a given set of keywords. Consider the sample query: Find a holiday package in a"pet-friendly" hotel; located in a" historical" yet" lively" city; with travel operated by an"economical" and" safe" airline.

Estimating the selectivity of approximate string queries,Arturas Mazeika; Michael H Böhlen; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract Approximate queries on string data are important due to the prevalence of suchdata in databases and various conventions and errors in string data. We present the VSolestimator; a novel technique for estimating the selectivity of approximate string queries. TheVSol estimator is based on inverse strings and makes the performance of the selectivityestimator independent of the number of strings. To get inverse strings we decompose alldatabase strings into overlapping substrings of length q (q-grams) and then associate eachq-gram with its inverse string: the IDs of all strings that contain the q-gram. We usesignatures to compress inverse strings; and clustering to group similar signatures. We studyour technique analytically and experimentally. The space complexity of our estimator onlydepends on the number of neighborhoods in the database and the desired estimation …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2007,38
Two-dimensional substring indexing,Paolo Ferragina; Nick Koudas; S Muthukrishnan; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract As databases have expanded in scope to storing string data (XML documents;product catalogs); it has become increasingly important to search databases based onmatching substrings; often on multiple; correlated dimensions. While string B-trees are I/Ooptimal in one dimension; no index structure with non-trivial query bounds is known for two-dimensional substring indexing. In this paper; we present a technique for two-dimensionalsubstring indexing based on a reduction to the geometric problem of identifying commoncolors in two ranges containing colored points. We develop an I/O efficient algorithm forsolving the common colors problem; and use it to obtain an I/O efficient (poly-logarithmicquery time) algorithm for the two-dimensional substring indexing problem.

Syntactic rule based approach toweb service composition,Ken Pu; Vagelis Hristidis; Nick Koudas,This paper studies a problem of web service composition from a syntactic approach. Incontrast with other approaches on enriched semantic description such as statetransitiondescription of web services; our focus is in the case when only the input-output typeinformation from the WSDL specifications is available. The web service composition problemis formally formulated as deriving a given desired type from a collection of available typesand web services using a prescribed set of rules with costs. We show that solving theminimal cost composition is NP-complete in general; and present a practical solution basedon dynamic programming.

Approximate joins: Concepts and techniques,Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract The quality of the data residing in information repositories and databases getsdegraded due to a multitude of reasons. Such reasons include typing mistakes duringinsertion (eg; character transpositions); lack of standards for recording database fields (eg;addresses); and various errors introduced by poor database design (eg; missing integrityconstraints). Data of poor quality can result in significant impediments to popular businesspractices: sending products or bills to incorrect addresses; inability to locate customerrecords during service calls; inability to correlate customers across multiple services; etc.,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,36
Text joins for data cleansing and integration in a relational database management system,*,An organization's data records are often noisy: because of transcription errors; incompleteinformation; and lack of standard formats for textual data. A fundamental task during datacleansing and integration is matching strings—perhaps across multiple relations—that referto the same entity (eg; organization name or address). Furthermore; it is desirable to performthis matching within an RDBMS; which is where the data is likely to reside. In this paper; Weadapt the widely used and established cosine similarity metric from the information retrievalfield to the relational database context in order to identify potential string matches acrossrelations. We then use this similarity metric to characterize this key aspect of data cleansingand integration as a join between relations on textual attributes; where the similarity ofmatches exceeds a specified threshold.

Validating multi-column schema matchings by type,Bing Tian Dai; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava; Anthony KH Tung; Suresh Venkatasubramanian,Validation of multi-column schema matchings is essential for successful databaseintegration. This task is especially difficult when the databases to be integrated contain littleoverlapping data; as is often the case in practice (eg; customer bases of differentcompanies). Based on the intuition that values present in different columns related by aschema matching will have similar" semantic type"; and that this can be captured usingdistributions over values (" statistical types"); we develop a method for validating 1-1 andcompositional schema matchings. Our technique is based on three key technical ideas. First;we propose a generic measure for comparing two columns matched by a schema matching;based on a notion of information-theoretic discrepancy that generalizes the standardgeometric discrepancy; this provides the basis for 1: 1 matching.

Information cascade at group scale,Milad Eftekhar; Yashar Ganjali; Nick Koudas,Abstract Identifying the k most influential individuals in a social network is a well-studiedproblem. The objective is to detect k individuals in a (social) network who will influence themaximum number of people; if they are independently convinced of adopting a new strategy(product; idea; etc). There are cases in real life; however; where we aim to instigate groupsinstead of individuals to trigger network diffusion. Such cases abound; eg; billboards; TVcommercials and newspaper ads are utilized extensively to boost the popularity and raiseawareness. In this paper; we generalize the" influential nodes" problem.

An efficient approximation scheme for data mining tasks,George Kollios; D Gunupulos; Nick Koudas; Stefan Berchtold,We investigate the use of biased sampling according to the density of the dataset; to speedup the operation of general data mining tasks; such as clustering and outlier detection inlarge multidimensional datasets. In density biased sampling; the probability that a givenpoint will be included in the sample depends on the local density of the dataset. We proposea general technique for density-biased sampling that can factor in user requirements tosample for properties of interest; and can be tuned for specific data mining tasks. This allowsgreat flexibility and improved accuracy of the results over simple random sampling.

Transparent anonymization: Thwarting adversaries who know the algorithm,Xiaokui Xiao; Yufei Tao; Nick Koudas,Abstract Numerous generalization techniques have been proposed for privacy-preservingdata publishing. Most existing techniques; however; implicitly assume that the adversaryknows little about the anonymization algorithm adopted by the data publisher.Consequently; they cannot guard against privacy attacks that exploit various characteristicsof the anonymization mechanism. This article provides a practical solution tothis problem.First; we propose an analytical model for evaluating disclosure risks; when an adversaryknows everything in the anonymization process; except the sensitive values. Based on thismodel; we develop a privacy principle; transparent l-diversity; which ensures privacyprotection against such powerful adversaries.

A lightweight online framework for query progress indicators,Chaitanya Mishra; Nick Koudas,Recently there has been increasing interest in the development of progress indicators forSQL queries. In this paper we present a lightweight online framework for this problem. Ourframework is online; in the sense that it refines its estimate of query progress based onfeedback received during query execution. It is lightweight; since our techniques aredesigned to impose minimal overhead on query execution without sacrificing accuracy ofestimates. Our framework can estimate progressively the output size of various relationaloperators and pipelines.

Integrating XML data sources using approximate joins,Sudipto Guha; HV Jagadish; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava; Ting Yu,Abstract XML is widely recognized as the data interchange standard of tomorrow because ofits ability to represent data from a variety of sources. Hence; XML is likely to be the formatthrough which data from multiple sources is integrated. In this article; we study the problemof integrating XML data sources through correlations realized as join operations. Achallenging aspect of this operation is the XML document structure. Two documents mightconvey approximately or exactly the same information but may be quite different in structure.Consequently; an approximate match in structure; in addition to content; has to be foldedinto the join operation. We quantify an approximate match in structure and content for pairsof XML documents using well defined notions of distance. We show how notions of distancethat have metric properties can be incorporated in a framework for joins between XML …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2006,27

We motivatethis problem in the context of two specific application areas; that of approximate queryanswering and data analysis. We propose a framework based on the notion of informationentropy that enables us to estimate the original values in a data set; given only aggregatedinformation about it. We also describe an alternate utility of the proposed framework; thatenables us to identify values that deviate from the underlying data distribution; suitable fordata mining purposes.

Method of performing approximate substring indexing,*,Approximate substring indexing is accomplished by decomposing each string in a databaseinto overlapping “positional q-grams”; sequences of a predetermined length q; andcontaining information regarding the “position” of each q-gram within the string (ie; 1st q-gram; 4th q-gram; etc.). An index is then formed of the tuples of the positional q-gram data(such as; for example; a B-tree index or a hash index). Each query applied to the database issimilarly parsed into a plurality of positional q-grams (of the same length); and a candidateset of matches is found. Position-directed filtering is used to remove the candidates whichhave the q-grams in the wrong order and/or too far apart to form a “verified” output ofmatching candidates. If errors are permitted (defined in terms of an edit distance betweeneach candidate and the query); an edit distance calculation can then be performed to …,*,2006,26

Indexing mixed types for approximate retrieval,Liang Jin; Chen Li; Nick Koudas; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract In various applications such as data cleansing; being able to retrieve categorical ornumerical attributes based on notions of approximate match (eg; edit distance; numericaldistance) is of profound importance. Commonly; approximate match predicates are specifiedon combinations of attributes in conjunction. Existing database techniques for approximateretrieval; however; limit their applicability to single attribute retrieval through B-trees andtheir variants. In this paper; we propose a methodology that utilizes known multidimensionalindexing structures for the problem of approximate multi-attribute retrieval.

We adopt aprobabilistic approach where we seek to report at any point of operation of the algorithm theconfidence that the top-k result has been identified. Such a functionality can be a valuableasset when one is interested in reducing the runtime cost of top-k computations.

Ad-hoc aggregations of ranked lists in the presence of hierarchies,Nilesh Bansal; Sudipto Guha; Nick Koudas,Abstract A variety of web sites and web based services produce textual lists at varying timegranularities ranked according to several criteria. For example; Google Trends produceslists of popular query keywords which can be visualized according to several criteria. AtFlickr; lists of popular tags used to tag the images uploaded can be visualized as a cloudbased on their popularity. Identification of the k most popular terms can be easily conductedby utilizing well known rank aggregation algorithms. In this paper we take a differentapproach to information discovery from such ranked lists. We maintain the same rankaggregation framework but we elevate terms at a higher level by making use of popular termhierarchies commonly available.

Optimizing away joins on data streams,Lukasz Golab; Theodore Johnson; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava; David Toman,Abstract Monitoring aggregates on network traffic streams is a compelling application of datastream management systems. Often; streaming aggregation queries involve joining multipleinputs (eg; client requests and server responses) using temporal join conditions (eg; within 5seconds); followed by computation of aggregates (eg; COUNT) over temporal windows (eg;every 5 minutes). These types of queries help identify malfunctioning servers (missingresponses); malicious clients (bursts of requests during a denial-of-service attack); orimproperly configured protocols (short timeout intervals causing many retransmissions).However; while such query expression is natural; its evaluation over massive data streamsis inefficient.

The design of a query monitoring system,Chaitanya Mishra; Nick Koudas,Abstract Query monitoring refers to the problem of observing and predicting variousparameters related to the execution of a query in a database system. In addition to being auseful tool for database users and administrators; it can also serve as an informationcollection service for resource allocation and adaptive query processing techniques. In thisarticle; we present a query monitoring system from the ground up; describing various newtechniques for query monitoring; their implementation inside a real database system; and anovel interface that presents the observed and predicted information in an accessiblemanner. To enable this system; we introduce several lightweight online techniques forprogressively estimating and refining the cardinality of different relational operators usinginformation collected at query execution time. These include binary and multiway joins as …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2009,16
Method of performing approximate substring indexing,*,Approximate substring indexing is accomplished by decomposing each string in a databaseinto overlapping “positional q-grams”; sequences of a predetermined length q; andcontaining information regarding the “position” of each q-gram within the string (ie; 1st q-gram; 4th q-gram; etc.). An index is then formed of the tuples of the positional q-gram data(such as; for example; a B-tree index or a hash index). Each query applied to the database issimilarly parsed into a plurality of positional q-grams (of the same length); and a candidateset of matches is found. Position-directed filtering is used to remove the candidates whichhave the q-grams in the wrong order and/or too far apart to form a “verified” output ofmatching candidates. If errors are permitted (defined in terms of an edit distance betweeneach candidate and the query); an edit distance calculation can then be performed to …,*,2008,16

Distribution based microdata anonymization,Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava; Ting Yu; Qing Zhang,Abstract Before sharing to support ad hoc aggregate analyses; microdata often need to beanonymized to protect the privacy of individuals. A variety of privacy models have beenproposed for microdata anonymization. Many of these models (eg; t-closeness) essentiallyrequire that; after anonymization; groups of sensitive attribute values follow specifieddistributions. To support such models; in this paper we study the problem of transforming agroup of sensitive attribute values to follow a certain target distribution with minimal datadistortion. Specifically; we develop and evaluate a novel methodology that combines the useof sensitive attribute permutation and generalization with the addition of fake sensitiveattribute values to achieve this transformation. We identify metrics related to accuracy ofaggregate query answers over the transformed data; and develop efficient anonymization …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,14

Index-based approximate XML joins,Sudipto Guha; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava; Ting Yu,XML data integration tools are facing a variety of challenges for their efficient and effectiveoperation. Among these is the requirement to handle a variety of inconsistencies or mistakespresent in the data sets. We study the problem of integrating XML data sources throughindex assisted join operations; using notions of approximate match in the structure andcontent of XML documents as the join predicate. We show how a well known and widelydeployed index structure; namely the R-tree; can be adopted to improve the performance ofsuch operations.

Meta-Data indexing for XPath location steps,SungRan Cho; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract XML is the de facto standard for data representation and exchange over the Web.Given the diversity of the information available in XML; it is very useful to annotate XML datawith a wide variety of meta-data; such as quality and sensitivity. When querying such XMLdata; say using XPath; it is important to efficiently identify the data that meet specifiedconstraints on the meta-data. For example; different users may be satisfied with differentlevels of quality guarantees; or may only have access to different parts of the XML databased on specified security policies. In this paper; we address the problem of efficientlyidentifying the XML elements along a location step in an XPath query; that satisfy meta-datarange constraints; when the meta-data levels are specifically drawn from an ordered domain(eg; accuracy in [0; 1]; recency using timestamps; multi-level security; etc.).

HASE: a hybrid approach to selectivity estimation for conjunctive predicates,Xiaohui Yu; Nick Koudas; Calisto Zuzarte,Abstract Current methods for selectivity estimation fall into two broad categories; synopsis-based and sampling-based. Synopsis-based methods; such as histograms; incur minimaloverhead at query optimization time and thus are widely used in commercial databasesystems. Sampling-based methods are more suited for ad-hoc queries; but often involvehigh I/O cost because of random access to the underlying data. Though both methods servethe same purpose of selectivity estimation; their interaction in the case of selectivityestimation for conjuncts of predicates on multiple attributes is largely unexplored. Our workaims at taking the best of both worlds; by making consistent use of synopses and sampleinformation when they are both present. To achieve this goal; we propose HASE; a novelestimation scheme based on a powerful mechanism called generalized raking. We …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,6

Join reordering by join simulation,Chaitanya Mishra; Nick Koudas,We introduce a framework for reordering join pipelines at runtime in a database system. Thisframework incorporates novel techniques for simulating the execution of a join pipelineusing random samples and statistical summaries. Our simulation techniques provideaccurate runtime cardinality estimates along all alternative execution paths of a join pipeline.These estimates are then utilized to compare costs of alternative execution paths in adynamic fashion; and reorder the pipeline if a better alternative path is found. We describesimulation techniques for pipelines of different kinds of join operators. We present anexperimental evaluation of a prototype implementation of our framework in an open sourcedata manager. The results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of the approach presentedherein.,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,5
On space constrained set selection problems,Themis Palpanas; Nick Koudas; Alberto Mendelzon,Abstract Space constrained optimization problems arise in a variety of applications; rangingfrom databases to ubiquitous computing. Typically; these problems involve selecting a set ofitems of interest; subject to a space constraint. We show that in many important applications;one faces variants of this basic problem; in which the individual items are sets themselves;and each set is associated with a benefit value. Since there are no known approximationalgorithms for these problems; we explore the use of greedy and randomized techniques.We present a detailed performance and theoretical evaluation of the algorithms; highlightingthe efficiency of the proposed solutions.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2008,5

Fast algorithms for spatial and multidimensional joins,Nikos Koudas,Since the introduction of the relational model of data; the join operation has received muchattention due to its unique feature of combining data from different relations. As DatabaseManagement Systems become richer in data types; there is increasing interest to extend thejoin operation to new data types; like geographical or spatial and multimedia data. Severalalgorithmic approaches have been proposed in the past. In this thesis; we present newalgorithms for executing join operations between new data types. The algorithms wepropose are robust; and they are generic; in the sense that they can be applied to a varietyof data types. We first introduce Filter Trees; a new indexing structure; that supports efficientjoin operations between spatial data types.

Fast identification of relational constraint violations,Amit Chandel; Nick Koudas; Ken Q Pu; Divesh Srivastava,Logical constraints;(eg;phone numbers in Toronto can have prefixes 416; 647; 905 only');are ubiquitous in relational databases. Traditional integrity constraints; such as functionaldependencies; are examples of such logical constraints as well. However; under frequentdatabase updates; schema evolution and transformations; they can be easily violated. As aresult; tables become inconsistent and data quality is degraded. In this paper we study theproblem of validating collections of user defined constraints on a number of relational tables.Our primary goal is to quickly identify which tables violate such constraints. Logicalconstraints are potentially complex logical formuli; and we demonstrate that they cannot beefficiently evaluated by SQL queries.

Reasoning about approximate match query results,Sudipto Guha; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava; Xiaohui Yu,Join techniques deploying approximate match predicates are fundamental data cleaningoperations. A variety of predicates have been utilized to quantify approximate match in suchoperations and some have been embedded in a declarative data cleaning framework.These techniques return pairs of tuples from both relations; tagged with a score; signifyingthe degree of similarity between the tuples in the pair according to the specific approximatematch predicate. In this paper; we consider the problem of estimating various parameters onthe output of declarative approximate join algorithms for planning purposes. Such algorithmsare highly time consuming; so precise knowledge of the result size as well as its scoredistribution is a pressing concern.

Efficient Computation of Subspace Skyline over Categorical Domains,Md Farhadur Rahman; Abolfazl Asudeh; Nick Koudas; Gautam Das,Abstract Platforms such as AirBnB; Zillow; Yelp; and related sites have transformed the waywe search for accommodation; restaurants; etc. The underlying datasets in such applicationshave numerous attributes that are mostly Boolean or Categorical. Discovering the skyline ofsuch datasets over a subset of attributes would identify entries that stand out while enablingnumerous applications. There are only a few algorithms designed to compute the skylineover categorical attributes; yet are applicable only when the number of attributes is small.

Price trade-offs in social media advertising,Milad Eftekhar; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Gautam Das; Nick Koudas,Abstract The prevalence of social media has sparked novel advertising models; vastlydifferent from the traditional keyword based bidding model adopted by search engines. Onesuch model is topic based advertising; popular with micro-blogging sites. Instead of biddingon keywords; the approach is based on bidding on topics; with the winning bid allowed todisseminate messages to users interested in the specific topic. Naturally topics have varyingcosts depending on multiple factors (eg; how popular or prevalent they are). Similarly usersin a micro-blogging site have diverse interests. Assuming one wishes to disseminate amessage to a set V of users interested in a specific topic; a question arises whether it ispossible to disseminate the same message by bidding on a set of topics that collectivelyreach the same users in V albeit at a cheaper cost.,Proceedings of the second ACM conference on Online social networks,2014,2

XML & Data Streams,Nicolas Bruno; Luis Gravano; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract XQuery path queries form the basis of complex matching and processing of XMLdata. Most current XML query processing techniques can be divided in two groups.Navigation-based algorithms compute results by analyzing an input stream of documentsone tag at a time. In contrast; index-based algorithms take advantage of (precomputed orcomputed-on-demand) numbering schemes over each input XML document in the stream. Inthis chapter; we present an index-based technique; Index-Filter; to answer multiple pathqueries. Index-Filter uses indexes built over the document tags to avoid processing largeportions of an input document that are guaranteed not to be part of any match. We analyzeIndex-Filter; compare it against Y-Filter; a state-of-the-art navigation-based technique; andpresent the advantages of each technique.,*,2003,2
Declustering R-Tree on Multi-Computer Architectures,Nick Koudas; Christos Faloutsos; Ibrahim Kamel,We study a method to decluster a spatial access method (and specifically an R-tree) on ashared-nothing multi-computer architecture [9].

Panel: querying networked databases,Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava,A large number of useful databases are currently accessible over the Web and withincorporate networks. In addition to being frequently updated; this collection of databasestends to be highly dynamic: new databases appear often; and databases (just like Websites) also disappear.

Efficient computation of spatial joins with intersection predicates,Nick Koudas,We introduce a new algorithm to compute the spatial join of two or more spatial data sets;when indexes are not available on them. Size Separation Spatial Join (S3 J) imposes ahierarchical decomposition of the data space and; in contrast to previous approaches;requires no replication of entities from the input data sets. Thus its execution time dependsonly on the sizes of the joined data sets. We described S3 J and present an analyticalevaluation of its I/O and processor requirements comparing them with those of previouslyproposed algorithms for the same problem. We show that S3 J has relatively simple costestimation formulas that can be exploited by a query optimizer. S3 J can be efficientlyimplemented using software already present in many relational systems. In addition; weintroduce Dynamic Spatial Bitmaps (DSB); a new technique that enables S3 J …,International Journal of Geographical Information Science,2002,*

Daily Archives: March 1; 2017,Noa Zaifman; M Eftekhar; Y Ganjali; N Koudas; G Burtch; A Ghose; S Wattal; S Parker,According to Parker (2014); crowdfunding platforms allow the public to make small investmentsinto entrepreneurial ventures. The very nature of crowdfunding insinuates that there are elementsof consumer value co-creation incorporated into every aspect of the business model. Crowdfundingplatforms are merely an intermediary for people to provide funding to businesses who in returncreate value for the investors and public. This particular study was unique as it focused on signalsof project quality and how they can cause information cascades to form. The study shows thatdue to information asymmetry between informed and uninformed investors and informationcascades; it is not always the best projects that receive funding. An information cascade occurswhen a person observes the actions of others; and despite their own private information; engagesin the same behaviour (Eftekhar; Ganjali & Koudas; 2013).

String...,Luis Gravano; Panagiotis G Ipeirotis; HV Jagadish; Nick Koudas; S Muthukrishnan; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract String data is ubiquitous; and its management has taken on particular importance inthe past few years. Approximate queries are very important on string data especially formore complex queries involving joins. This is due; for example; to the prevalence oftypographical errors in data; and multiple conventions for recording attributes such as nameand address. Commercial databases do not support approximate string joins directly; and itis a challenge to implement this functionality efficiently with user-defined functions (UDFs). Inthis paper; we develop a technique for building approximate string join capabilities on top ofcommercial databases by exploiting facilities already available in them. At the core; ourtechnique relies on matching short substrings of length; called-grams; and taking intoaccount both positions of individual matches and the total number of such matches. Our …,*,*,*

Flexible String Matching Against Large Databases in Practice (Paper# 709),Nick Koudas; Amit Marathe; Divesh Srivastava,*,*,*,*
CALL FOR PAPERS IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering “Knowledge and Data Engineering in the Semantic Web Era” Special Issue in Early 20...,N Koudas; Gottfried Vossen; Miltiadis Lytras; Nick Koudas,The Semantic Web vision has evolved in the last years as a blueprint for a knowledge-basedframework aimed at crossing the chasm from the current Web of unstructured information resourcesto a Web equipped with metadata and oriented to delegation of tasks to software agents. Ontologiesare the key piece of this framework in that they provide shared semantics to metadata; thus enablinga degree of semantic interoperability. The requirements of large-scale deployment and interoperabilityof the Semantic Web vision represent a major challenge to data and knowledgeengineering; which raises a number of issues and requirements regarding how to represent;create; manage and use both ontologies as shared knowledge representations; but also largevolumes of metadata records used to annotate Web resources of a diverse kind.

Optimizing Away Joins on Data Streams,Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava; David Toman,Abstract. Monitoring aggregates on IP traffic data streams is a compelling application fordata stream management systems. Often; such streaming aggregation queries involvejoining multiple streams (eg; streams of SYN and ACK packets) using temporal joinconditions (eg; within 5 seconds); followed by computation of aggregates (eg; COUNT) overtemporal tumbling windows (eg; every 5 minutes). While such a query expression is natural;its evaluation over high speed IP traffic data streams is infeasible in practice. In this paper;we develop rewriting techniques for streaming aggregation queries that identify conditionsunder which such joins can be optimized away; while providing error bounds for results ofthe rewritten queries. The basis of the optimization is a powerful but decidable theory inwhich constraints over data streams can be formulated. The result error bounds are …,*,*,*
NNH: Improving Performance of Nearest-Neighbor Searches Using Histograms (Full Version. UCI Technical Report; Dec. 2003),Liang Jin; Nick Koudas; Chen Li,Abstract. Efficient search for nearest neighbors (NN) is a fundamental problem arising in alarge variety of applications of vast practical interest. In this paper we propose a noveltechnique; called NNH (“Nearest Neighbor Histograms”); which uses specific histogramstructures to improve the performance of NN search algorithms. A primary feature of ourproposal is that such histogram structures can co-exist in conjunction with a plethora of NNsearch algorithms without the need to substantially modify them. The main idea behind ourproposal is to choose a small number of pivot objects in the space; and pre-calculate thedistances to their nearest neighbors. We provide a complete specification of such histogramstructures and show how to make use of the information they provide towards more effectivesearching. In particular; we show how to construct them; how to decide the number of …,*,*,*
