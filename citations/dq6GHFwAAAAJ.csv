Modular order-preserving encryption; revisited,Charalampos Mavroforakis; Nathan Chenette; Adam O'Neill; George Kollios; Ran Canetti,Abstract Order-preserving encryption (OPE) schemes; whose ciphertexts preserve thenatural ordering of the plaintexts; allow efficient range query processing over outsourcedencrypted databases without giving the server access to the decryption key. Such schemeshave recently received increased interest in both the database and the cryptographiccommunities. In particular; modular order-preserving encryption (MOPE); due to Boldyrevaet al.; is a promising extension that increases the security of the basic OPE by introducing asecret modular offset to each data value prior to encrypting it. However; executing rangequeries via MOPE in a naive way allows the adversary to learn this offset; negating anypotential security gains of this approach. In this paper; we systematically address thisvulnerability and show that MOPE can be used to build a practical system for executing …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,36
Complex support vector machines for regression and quaternary classification,Pantelis Bouboulis; Sergios Theodoridis; Charalampos Mavroforakis; Leoni Evaggelatou-Dalla,The paper presents a new framework for complex support vector regression (SVR) as wellas Support Vector Machines (SVM) for quaternary classification. The method exploits thenotion of widely linear estimation to model the input-out relation for complex-valued dataand considers two cases: 1) the complex data are split into their real and imaginary partsand a typical real kernel is employed to map the complex data to a complexified featurespace and 2) a pure complex kernel is used to directly map the data to the induced complexfeature space. The recently developed Wirtinger's calculus on complex reproducing kernelHilbert spaces is employed to compute the Lagrangian and derive the dual optimizationproblem. As one of our major results; we prove that any complex SVM/SVR task isequivalent with solving two real SVM/SVR tasks exploiting a specific real kernel; which is …,IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,2015,18
Improving co-cluster quality with application to product recommendations,Michail Vlachos; Francesco Fusco; Charalambos Mavroforakis; Anastasios Kyrillidis; Vassilios G Vassiliadis,Abstract Businesses store an ever increasing amount of historical customer sales data.Given the availability of such information; it is advantageous to analyze past sales; both forrevealing dominant buying patterns; and for providing more targeted recommendations toclients. In this context; co-clustering has proved to be an important data-modeling primitivefor revealing latent connections between two sets of entities; such as customers andproducts. In this work; we introduce a new algorithm for co-clustering that is both scalableand highly resilient to noise. Our method is inspired by k-Means and agglomerativehierarchical clustering approaches:(i) first it searches for elementary co-clustering structuresand (ii) then combines them into a better; more compact; solution. The algorithm is flexibleas it does not require an explicit number of co-clusters as input; and is directly applicable …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2014,14
Spanning edge centrality: Large-scale computation and applications,Charalampos Mavroforakis; Richard Garcia-Lebron; Ioannis Koutis; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract The spanning centrality of an edge e in an undirected graph G is the fraction of thespanning trees of G that contain e. Despite its appealing definition and apparent value incertain applications in computational biology; spanning centrality hasn't so far received awider attention as a measure of edge centrality. We may partially attribute this to theperceived complexity of computing it; which appears to be prohibitive for very largenetworks. Contrary to this intuition; spanning centrality can in fact be approximated arbitrarywell by very efficient near-linear time algorithms due to Spielman and Srivastava; combinedwith progress in linear system solvers. In this article we bring theory into practice; withcareful and optimized implementations that allow the fast computation of spanning centralityin very large graphs with millions of nodes. With this computational tool in our disposition …,Proceedings of the 24th international conference on world wide web,2015,12
Absorbing random-walk centrality: Theory and algorithms,Charalampos Mavroforakis; Michael Mathioudakis; Aristides Gionis,We study a new notion of graph centrality based on absorbing random walks. Given a graphG=(V; E) and a set of query nodes Q⊆ V; we aim to identify the k most central nodes in Gwith respect to Q. Specifically; we consider central nodes to be absorbing for random walksthat start at the query nodes Q. The goal is to find the set of k central nodes that minimizesthe expected length of a random walk until absorption. The proposed measure; which wecall k absorbing random-walk centrality; favors diverse sets; as it is beneficial to place the kabsorbing nodes in different parts of the graph so as to “intercept” random walks that startfrom different query nodes. Although similar problem definitions have been considered inthe literature; eg; in information-retrieval settings where the goal is to diversify web-searchresults; in this paper we study the problem formally and prove some of its properties. We …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,8
Modeling the dynamics of online learning activity,Charalampos Mavroforakis; Isabel Valera; Manuel Gomez Rodriguez,Abstract: People are increasingly relying on the Web and social media to find solutions totheir problems in a wide range of domains. In this online setting; closely related problemsoften lead to the same characteristic learning pattern; in which people sharing theseproblems visit related pieces of information; perform almost identical queries or; moregenerally; take a series of similar actions. In this paper; we introduce a novel modelingframework for clustering continuous-time grouped streaming data; the hierarchical DirichletHawkes process (HDHP); which allows us to automatically uncover a wide variety oflearning patterns from detailed traces of learning activity.

Complex support vector regression,Pantelis Bouboulis; Sergios Theodoridis; Charalampos Mavroforakis,We present a support vector regression (SVR) rationale for treating complex data; exploitingthe notions of widely linear estimation and pure complex kernels. To compute theLagrangian and derive the dual problem; we employ the recently presented Wirtinger'scalculus on complex RKHS.

Active Positive-Definite Matrix Completion,Charalampos Mavroforakis; Dóra Erdös; Mark Crovella; Evimaria Terzi,Abstract In many applications; eg; recommender systems and biological data analysis; thedatasets of interest are positive definite (PD) matrices. Such matrices are usually similaritymatrices; obtained by the multiplication of a matrix of preferences or observations with itstranspose. Oftentimes; such real-world matrices are missing many entries and afundamental data-analysis task; known by the term PD-matrix completion; is the inference ofthese missing entries. In this paper; we introduce the active version of PD-matrix completion;in which we assume access to an oracle that; at a given cost; returns the value of anunobserved entry of the PD matrix. In this setting; we consider the following question:“givena fixed budget; which entries should we query so that the completion of the new matrix ismuch more indicative of the underlying data?”. The main contribution of the paper is the …,SIAM International Conference on Data Mining 2017,2017,1

Mining tours and paths in activity networks,Sofia Maria Nikolakaki; Charalampos Mavroforakis; Alina Ene; Evimaria Terzi,ABSTRACT The proliferation of online social networks and the spread of smart mobiledevices enable the collection of information related to a multitude of users' activities. Thesenetworks; where every node is associated with a type of action and a frequency; are usuallyreferred to as activity networks. Examples of such networks include city road networks;where the nodes are intersections and the edges are road segments. Each node isassociated with a number of geolocated actions that users of an online platform took in itsvicinity. In these networks; we define a prize-collecting subgraph to be a connected set ofnodes; which is compact; ie; the nodes are close to each other; and exhibits high levels ofactivity. The k-PCSubgraphs problem we address in this paper is defined as follows: givenan activity network and an integer k; identify k non-overlapping and connected subgraphs …,*,2018,*
