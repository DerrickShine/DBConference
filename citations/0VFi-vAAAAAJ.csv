Discovering similar multidimensional trajectories,Michail Vlachos; George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos,We investigate techniques for analysis and retrieval of object trajectories in two or threedimensional space. Such data usually contain a large amount of noise; that has madepreviously used metrics fail. Therefore; we formalize non-metric similarity functions based onthe longest common subsequence (LCSS); which are very robust to noise and furthermoreprovide an intuitive notion of similarity between trajectories by giving more weight to similarportions of the sequences. Stretching of sequences in time is allowed; as well as globaltranslation of the sequences in space. Efficient approximate algorithms that compute thesesimilarity measures are also provided. We compare these new methods to the widely usedEuclidean and time warping distance functions (for real and synthetic data) and show thesuperiority of our approach; especially in the strong presence of noise. We prove a …,Data Engineering; 2002. Proceedings. 18th International Conference on,2002,1231
Approximate aggregation techniques for sensor databases,Jeffrey Considine; Feifei Li; George Kollios; John Byers,In the emerging area of sensor-based systems; a significant challenge is to developscalable; fault-tolerant methods to extract useful information from the data the sensorscollect. An approach to this data management problem is the use of sensor databasesystems; exemplified by TinyDB and Cougar; which allow users to perform aggregationqueries such as MIN; COUNT and AVG on a sensor network. Due to power and rangeconstraints; centralized approaches are generally impractical; so most systems use in-network aggregation to reduce network traffic. However; these aggregation strategiesbecome bandwidth-intensive when combined with the fault-tolerant; multipath routingmethods often used in these environments. For example; duplicate-sensitive aggregatessuch as SUM cannot be computed exactly using substantially less bandwidth than explicit …,Data Engineering; 2004.

On indexing mobile objects,George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract We show how to index mobile objects in one and two dimensions using efficientdynamic external memory data structures. The problem is motivated by real life applicationsin traffic monitoring; intelligent navigation and mobile communications domains. For the l-dimensional case; we give (i) a dynamic; external memory algorithm with guaranteed worstcase performance and linear space and (ii) a practical approximation algorithm also in thedynamic; external memory setting; which has linear space and expected logarithmic querytime. We also give an algorithm with guaranteed logarithmic query time for a restrictedversion of the problem. We present extensions of our techniques to two dimensions. Inaddition we give a lower bound on the number of I/O's needed to answer the d-dimensionalproblem.

Dynamic authenticated index structures for outsourced databases,Feifei Li; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; George Kollios; Leonid Reyzin,Abstract In outsourced database (ODB) systems the database owner publishes its datathrough a number of remote servers; with the goal of enabling clients at the edge of thenetwork to access and query the data more efficiently. As servers might be untrusted or canbe compromised; query authentication becomes an essential component of ODB systems.Existing solutions for this problem concentrate mostly on static scenarios and are based onidealistic properties for certain cryptographic primitives. In this work; first we define a varietyof essential and practical cost metrics associated with ODB systems. Then; we analyticallyevaluate a number of different approaches; in search for a solution that best leverages allmetrics. Most importantly; we look at solutions that can handle dynamic scenarios; whereowners periodically update the data residing at the servers. Finally; we discuss query …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,375
Mining; indexing; and querying historical spatiotemporal data,Nikos Mamoulis; Huiping Cao; George Kollios; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Yufei Tao; David W Cheung,Abstract In many applications that track and analyze spatiotemporal data; movements obeyperiodic patterns; the objects follow the same routes (approximately) over regular timeintervals. For example; people wake up at the same time and follow more or less the sameroute to their work everyday. The discovery of hidden periodic patterns in spatiotemporaldata; apart from unveiling important information to the data analyst; can facilitate datamanagement substantially. Based on this observation; we propose a framework thatanalyzes; manages; and queries object movements that follow such patterns. We define thespatiotemporal periodic pattern mining problem and propose an effective and fast miningalgorithm for retrieving maximal periodic patterns. We also devise a novel; specialized indexstructure that can benefit from the discovered patterns to support more efficient execution …,Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2004,318
On trip planning queries in spatial databases,Feifei Li; Dihan Cheng; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; George Kollios; Shang-Hua Teng,Abstract In this paper we discuss a new type of query in Spatial Databases; called the TripPlanning Query (TPQ). Given a set of points of interest P in space; where each point belongsto a specific category; a starting point S and a destination E; TPQ retrieves the best trip thatstarts at S; passes through at least one point from each category; and ends at E. Forexample; a driver traveling from Boston to Providence might want to stop to a gas station; abank and a post office on his way; and the goal is to provide him with the best possible route(in terms of distance; traffic; road conditions; etc.). The difficulty of this query lies in theexistence of multiple choices per category. In this paper; we study fast approximationalgorithms for TPQ in a metric space. We provide a number of approximation algorithms withapproximation ratios that depend on either the number of categories; the maximum …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2005,267
MRShare: sharing across multiple queries in MapReduce,Tomasz Nykiel; Michalis Potamias; Chaitanya Mishra; George Kollios; Nick Koudas,Abstract Large-scale data analysis lies in the core of modern enterprises and scientificresearch. With the emergence of cloud computing; the use of an analytical query processinginfrastructure (eg; Amazon EC2) can be directly mapped to monetary value. MapReduce hasbeen a popular framework in the context of cloud computing; designed to serve long runningqueries (jobs) which can be processed in batch mode. Taking into account that different jobsoften perform similar work; there are many opportunities for sharing. In principle; sharingsimilar work reduces the overall amount of work; which can lead to reducing monetarycharges incurred while utilizing the processing infrastructure. In this paper we propose asharing framework tailored to MapReduce.

Approximating multi-dimensional aggregate range queries over real attributes,Dimitrios Gunopulos; George Kollios; Vassilis J Tsotras; Carlotta Domeniconi,Abstract Finding approximate answers to multi-dimensional range queries over real valuedattributes has significant applications in data exploration and database query optimization.In this paper we consider the following problem: given a table of d attributes whose domainis the real numbers; and a query that specifies a range in each dimension; find a goodapproximation of the number of records in the table that satisfy the query. We present a newhistogram technique that is designed to approximate the density of multi-dimensionaldatasets with real attributes. Our technique finds buckets of variable size; and allows thebuckets to overlap. Overlapping buckets allow more efficient approximation of the density.The size of the cells is based on the local density of the data. This technique leads to a fasterand more compact approximation of the data distribution. We also show how to …,Acm Sigmod Record,2000,226
Discovering clusters in motion time-series data,Jonathan Alon; Stan Sclaroff; George Kollios; Vladimir Pavlovic,An approach is proposed for clustering time-series data. The approach can be used todiscover groupings of similar object motions that were observed in a video collection. A finitemixture of hidden Markov models (HMMs) is fitted to the motion data using the expectationmaximization (EM) framework. Previous approaches for HMM-based clustering employ a k-means formulation; where each sequence is assigned to only a single HMM. In contrast; theformulation presented in this paper allows each sequence to belong to more than a singleHMM with some probability; and the hard decision about the sequence class membershipcan be deferred until a later time when such a decision is required. Experiments withsimulated data demonstrate the benefit of using this EM-based approach when there ismore" overlap" in the processes generating the data.

Boostmap: A method for efficient approximate similarity rankings,Vassilis Athitsos; Jonathan Alon; Stan Sclaroff; George Kollios,This paper introduces BoostMap; a method that can significantly reduce retrieval time inimage and video database systems that employ computationally expensive distancemeasures; metric or non-metric. Database and query objects are embedded into aEuclidean space; in which similarities can be rapidly measured using a weighted Manhattandistance. Embedding construction is formulated as a machine learning task; whereAdaBoost is used to combine many simple; ID embeddings into a multidimensionalembedding that preserves a significant amount of the proximity structure in the originalspace. Performance is evaluated in a hand pose estimation system; and a dynamic gesturerecognition system; where the proposed method is used to retrieve approximate nearestneighbors under expensive image and video similarity measures: In both systems; in …,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; 2004.

Efficient biased sampling for approximate clustering and outlier detection in large data sets,George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Nick Koudas; Stefan Berchtold,We investigate the use of biased sampling according to the density of the data set to speedup the operation of general data mining tasks; such as clustering and outlier detection inlarge multidimensional data sets. In density-biased sampling; the probability that a givenpoint will be included in the sample depends on the local density of the data set. Wepropose a general technique for density-biased sampling that can factor in userrequirements to sample for properties of interest and can be tuned for specific data miningtasks. This allows great flexibility and improved accuracy of the results over simple randomsampling. We describe our approach in detail; we analytically evaluate it; and show how itcan be optimized for approximate clustering and outlier detection. Finally; we present athorough experimental evaluation of the proposed method; applying density-biased …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2003,197
Efficient indexing of spatiotemporal objects,Marios Hadjieleftheriou; George Kollios; Vassilis J Tsotras; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Spatiotemporal objects ie; objects which change their position and/or extent overtime; appear in many applications. This paper addresses the problem of indexing largevolumes of such data. We consider general object movements and extent changes. Wefurther concentrate on “snapshot” as well as small “interval” historical queries on thegathered data. The obvious approach that approximates spatiotemporal objects with MBRsand uses a traditional multidimensional access method to index them is inefficient. Objectsthat “live” for long time intervals have large MBRs which introduce a lot of empty space.Clustering long intervals has been dealt in temporal databases by the use of partiallypersistent indices. What differentiates this problem from traditional temporal indexing is thatobjects are allowed to move/change during their lifetime. Better methods are thus needed …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2002,192
Non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques for classification and visualization,Michail Vlachos; Carlotta Domeniconi; Dimitrios Gunopulos; George Kollios; Nick Koudas,Abstract In this paper we address the issue of using local embeddings for data visualizationin two and three dimensions; and for classification. We advocate their use on the basis thatthey provide an efficient mapping procedure from the original dimension of the data; to alower intrinsic dimension. We depict how they can accurately capture the user's perceptionof similarity in high-dimensional data for visualization purposes. Moreover; we exploit thelow-dimensional mapping provided by these embeddings; to develop new classificationtechniques; and we show experimentally that the classification accuracy is comparable(albeit using fewer dimensions) to a number of other classification procedures.,Proceedings of the eighth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2002,188
Extraction and clustering of motion trajectories in video,Dan Buzan; Stan Sclaroff; George Kollios,A system that tracks moving objects in a video dataset so as to extract a representation of theobjects' 3D trajectories is described. The system then finds hierarchical clusters of similartrajectories in the video dataset. Objects' motion trajectories are extracted via an EKFformulation that provides each object's 3D trajectory up to a constant factor. To increaseaccuracy when occlusions occur; multiple tracking hypotheses are followed. For trajectory-based clustering and retrieval; a modified version of edit distance; called longest commonsubsequence is employed. Similarities are computed between projections of trajectories oncoordinate axes. Trajectories are grouped based; using an agglomerative clusteringalgorithm. To check the validity of the approach; experiments using real data wereperformed.,Pattern Recognition; 2004. ICPR 2004. Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on,2004,185
Spatio-temporal aggregation using sketches,Yufei Tao; George Kollios; Jeffrey Considine; Feifei Li; Dimitris Papadias,Several spatio-temporal applications require the retrieval of summarized information aboutmoving objects that lie in a query region during a query interval (eg; the number of mobileusers covered by a cell; traffic volume in a district; etc.). Existing solutions have the distinctcounting problem: if an object remains in the query region for several timestamps during thequery interval; it will be counted multiple times in the result. We solve this problem byintegrating spatio-temporal indexes with sketches; traditionally used for approximate queryprocessing. The proposed techniques can also be applied to reduce the space requirementsof conventional spatio-temporal data and to mine spatio-temporal association rules.,Data Engineering; 2004.

Nearest neighbor queries in a mobile environment,George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Nearest neighbor queries have received much interest in recent years due to theirincreased importance in advanced database applications. However; past work hasaddressed such queries in a static setting. In this paper we consider instead a dynamicsetting where data objects move continuously. Such a mobile spatiotemporal environment ismotivated by real life applications in traffic management; intelligent navigation and cellularcommunication systems. We consider two versions of nearest neighbor queries dependingon whether the temporal predicate is a single time instant or an interval. For example:“findthe closest object to a given object o after 10 minutes from now”; or;“find the object that willbe the closest to object o between 10 and 15 minutes from now”. Since data objects movecontinuously it is inefficient to update the database about their position at each time …,*,1999,131
Efficient processing of top-k queries in uncertain databases with x-relations,Ke Yi; Feifei Li; George Kollios; Divesh Srivastava,This work introduces novel polynomial algorithms for processing top-k queries in uncertaindatabases under the generally adopted model of x-relations. An x-relation consists of anumber of x-tuples; and each x-tuple randomly instantiates into one tuple from one or morealternatives. Our results significantly improve the best known algorithms for top-k queryprocessing in uncertain databases; in terms of both runtime and memory usage. In the single-alternative case; the new algorithms are 2 to 3 orders of magnitude faster than the previousalgorithms. In the multialternative case; we introduce the first-known polynomial algorithms;while the current best algorithms have exponential complexity in both time and space. Ouralgorithms run in near linear or low polynomial time and cover both types of top-k queries inuncertain databases. We provide both the theoretical analysis and an extensive …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2008,128
K-nearest neighbors in uncertain graphs,Michalis Potamias; Francesco Bonchi; Aristides Gionis; George Kollios,Abstract Complex networks; such as biological; social; and communication networks; oftenentail uncertainty; and thus; can be modeled as probabilistic graphs. Similar to the problemof similarity search in standard graphs; a fundamental problem for probabilistic graphs is toefficiently answer k-nearest neighbor queries (k-NN); which is the problem of computing thek closest nodes to some specific node. In this paper we introduce a framework forprocessing k-NN queries in probabilistic graphs. We propose novel distance functions thatextend well-known graph concepts; such as shortest paths. In order to compute them inprobabilistic graphs; we design algorithms based on sampling. During k-NN queryprocessing we efficiently prune the search space using novel techniques.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,127
Indexing animated objects using spatiotemporal access methods,George Kollios; Vassilis J.  Tsotras; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Alex Delis; Marios Hadjieleftheriou,We present an approach for indexing animated objects and efficiently answering queriesabout their position in time and space. In particular; we consider an animated movie as aspatiotemporal evolution. A movie is viewed as an ordered sequence of frames; where eachframe is a 2D space occupied by the objects that appear in that frame. The queries ofinterest are range queries of the form;" find the objects that appear in area S between framesf/sub i/and f/sub j//sup"/as well as nearest neighbor queries such as;" find the q nearestobjects to a given position A between frames f/sub i/and f/sub j//sup"/. The straightforwardapproach to index such objects considers the frame sequence as another dimension anduses a 3D access method (such as an R-Tree or its variants). This; however; assigns long"lifetime" intervals to objects that appear through many consecutive frames. Long intervals …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2001,127

Complex spatio-temporal pattern queries,Marios Hadjieleftheriou; George Kollios; Petko Bakalov; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract This paper introduces a novel type of query; what we name Spatio-temporal PatternQueries (STP). Such a query specifies a spatiotemporal pattern as a sequence of distinctspatial predicates where the predicate temporal ordering (exact or relative) matters. STPqueries can use various types of spatial predicates (range search; nearest neighbor; etc.)where each such predicate is associated (1) with an exact temporal constraint (a time-instantor a time-interval); or (2) more generally; with a relative order among the other querypredicates. Using traditional spatiotemporal index structures for these types of queries wouldbe either inefficient or not an applicable solution. Alternatively; we propose specializedquery evaluation algorithms for STP queries With Time. We also present a novel indexstructure; suitable for STP queries With Order.

Time series compressibility and privacy,Spiros Papadimitriou; Feifei Li; George Kollios; Philip S Yu,Abstract In this paper we study the trade-offs between time series compressibility and partialinformation hiding and their fundamental implications on how we should introduceuncertainty about individual values by perturbing them. More specifically; if the perturbationdoes not have the same compressibility properties as the original data; then it can bedetected and filtered out; reducing uncertainty. Thus; by making the perturbation" similar" tothe original data; we can both preserve the structure of the data better; while simultaneouslymaking breaches harder. However; as data become more compressible; a fraction of theuncertainty can be removed if true values are leaked; revealing how they were perturbed.We formalize these notions; study the above trade-offs on real data and develop practicalschemes which strike a good balance and can also be extended for on-the-fly data hiding …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,111
Nearest neighbor retrieval using distance-based hashing,Vassilis Athitsos; Michalis Potamias; Panagiotis Papapetrou; George Kollios,A method is proposed for indexing spaces with arbitrary distance measures; so as toachieve efficient approximate nearest neighbor retrieval. Hashing methods; such as LocalitySensitive Hashing (LSH); have been successfully applied for similarity indexing in vectorspaces and string spaces under the Hamming distance. The key novelty of the hashingtechnique proposed here is that it can be applied to spaces with arbitrary distancemeasures; including non-metric distance measures. First; we describe a domain-independent method for constructing a family of binary hash functions. Then; we use thesefunctions to construct multiple multibit hash tables. We show that the LSH formalism is notapplicable for analyzing the behavior of these tables as index structures.

On-line discovery of dense areas in spatio-temporal databases,Marios Hadjieleftheriou; George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Moving object databases have received considerable attention recently. Previouswork has concentrated mainly on modeling and indexing problems; as well as queryselectivity estimation. Here we introduce a novel problem; that of addressing density-basedqueries in the spatio-temporal domain. For example:“Find all regions that will contain morethan 500 objects; ten minutes from now”. The user may also be interested in finding the timeperiod (interval) that the query answer remains valid. We formally define a new class ofdensity-based queries and give approximate; on-line techniques that answer themefficiently. Typically the threshold above which a region is considered to be dense is part ofthe query. The difficulty of the problem lies in the fact that the spatial and temporal predicatesare not specified by the query. The techniques we introduce find all candidate dense …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2003,106
Discovering frequent arrangements of temporal intervals,Panagiotis Papapetrou; George Kollios; Stan Sclaroff; Dimitrios Gunopulos,In this paper we study a new problem in temporal pattern mining: discovering frequentarrangements of temporal intervals. We assume that the database consists of sequences ofevents; where an event occurs during a time-interval. The goal is to mine arrangements ofevent intervals that appear frequently in the database. There are many applications wherethese type of patterns can be useful; including data network; scientific; and financialapplications. Efficient methods to find frequent arrangements of temporal intervals usingboth breadth first and depth first search techniques are described. The performance of theproposed algorithms is evaluated and compared with other approaches on real datasets(American sign language streams and network data) and large synthetic datasets.,Data Mining; Fifth IEEE International Conference on,2005,97
Boostmap: An embedding method for efficient nearest neighbor retrieval,Vassilis Athitsos; Jonathan Alon; Stan Sclaroff; George Kollios,This paper describes BoostMap; a method for efficient nearest neighbor retrieval undercomputationally expensive distance measures. Database and query objects are embeddedinto a vector space in which distances can be measured efficiently. Each embedding istreated as a classifier that predicts for any three objects X; A; B whether X is closer to A or toB. It is shown that a linear combination of such embedding-based classifiers naturallycorresponds to an embedding and a distance measure. Based on this property; theBoostMap method reduces the problem of embedding construction to the classical boostingproblem of combining many weak classifiers into an optimized strong classifier. Theclassification accuracy of the resulting strong classifier is a direct measure of the amount ofnearest neighbor structure preserved by the embedding.

Spatial outsourcing for location-based services,Yin Yang; Stavros Papadopoulos; Dimitris Papadias; George Kollios,The embedding of positioning capabilities in mobile devices and the emergence of location-based applications have created novel opportunities for utilizing several types of multi-dimensional data through spatial outsourcing. In this setting; a data owner (DO) delegates itsdata management tasks to a location-based service (LBS) that processes queries originatingfrom several clients/subscribers. Because the LBS is not the real owner of the data; it mustprove (to each client) the correctness of query output using an authenticated structuresigned by the DO. Currently there is very narrow selection of multi-dimensionalauthenticated structures; among which the VR-tree is the best choice. Our first contribution isthe MR-tree; a novel index suitable for spatial outsourcing. We show; analytically andexperimentally; that the MR-tree outperforms the VR-tree; usually by orders of magnitude …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,92
Authenticated indexing for outsourced spatial databases,Yin Yang; Stavros Papadopoulos; Dimitris Papadias; George Kollios,Abstract In spatial database outsourcing; a data owner delegates its data management tasksto a location-based service (LBS); which indexes the data with an authenticated datastructure (ADS). The LBS receives queries (ranges; nearest neighbors) originating fromseveral clients/subscribers. Each query initiates the computation of a verification object (VO)based on the ADS. The VO is returned to the client that can verify the result correctnessusing the public key of the owner. Our first contribution is the MR-tree; a space-efficient ADSthat supports fast query processing and verification. Our second contribution is the MR*-tree;a modified version of the MR-tree; which significantly reduces the VO size through a novelembedding technique. Finally; whereas most ADSs must be constructed and maintained bythe owner; we outsource the MR-and MR*-tree construction and maintenance to the LBS …,The VLDB Journal,2009,90
Robust similarity measures for mobile object trajectories,Michail Vlachos; Dimitrios Gunopulos; George Kollios,We investigate techniques for similarity analysis of spatio-temporal trajectories for mobileobjects. Such data may contain a large number of outliers; which degrade the performanceof Euclidean and time warping distance. Therefore; we propose the use of non-metricdistance functions based on the longest common subsequence (LCSS); in conjunction witha sigmoidal matching function. Finally; we compare these new methods to various L/subp/norms and also to time warping distance (for real and synthetic data) and presentexperimental results that validate the accuracy and efficiency of our approach; especially inthe presence of noise.,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 2002.

Selectivity estimators for multidimensional range queries over real attributes,Dimitrios Gunopulos; George Kollios; Vassilis J Tsotras; Carlotta Domeniconi,Abstract. Estimating the selectivity of multidimensional range queries over real valuedattributes has significant applications in data exploration and database query optimization.In this paper; we consider the following problem: given a table of d attributes whose domainis the real numbers and a query that specifies a range in each dimension; find a goodapproximation of the number of records in the table that satisfy the query. The simplestapproach to tackle this problem is to assume that the attributes are independent. Moreaccurate estimators try to capture the joint data distribution of the attributes. In databases;such estimators include the construction of multidimensional histograms; random sampling;or the wavelet transform. In statistics; kernel estimation techniques are being used. Manytraditional approaches assume that attribute values come from discrete; finite domains …,The VLDB Journal,2005,88
Indexing spatiotemporal archives,Marios Hadjieleftheriou; George Kollios; Vassilis J Tsotras; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Spatiotemporal objects–that is; objects that evolve over time–appear in manyapplications. Due to the nature of such applications; storing the evolution of objects throughtime in order to answer historical queries (queries that refer to past states of the evolution)requires a very large specialized database; what is termed in this article a spatiotemporalarchive. Efficient processing of historical queries on spatiotemporal archives requiresequally sophisticated indexing schemes. Typical spatiotemporal indexing techniquesrepresent the objects using minimum bounding regions (MBR) extended with a temporaldimension; which are then indexed using traditional multidimensional index structures.However; rough MBR approximations introduce excessive overlap between index nodes;which deteriorates query performance.

Approximate embedding-based subsequence matching of time series,Vassilis Athitsos; Panagiotis Papapetrou; Michalis Potamias; George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract A method for approximate subsequence matching is introduced; that significantlyimproves the efficiency of subsequence matching in large time series data sets under thedynamic time warping (DTW) distance measure. Our method is called EBSM; shorthand forEmbedding-Based Subsequence Matching. The key idea is to convert subsequencematching to vector matching using an embedding. This embedding maps each databasetime series into a sequence of vectors; so that every step of every time series in the databaseis mapped to a vector. The embedding is computed by applying full dynamic time warpingbetween reference objects and each database time series. At runtime; given a query object;an embedding of that object is computed in the same manner; by running dynamic timewarping between the reference objects and the query.

Proof-infused streams: Enabling authentication of sliding window queries on streams,Feifei Li; Ke Yi; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; George Kollios,Abstract As computer systems are essential components of many critical commercialservices; the need for secure online transactions is now becoming evident. The demand forsuch applications; as the market grows; exceeds the capacity of individual businesses toprovide fast and reliable services; making outsourcing technologies a key player inalleviating issues of scale. Consider a stock broker that needs to provide a real-time stocktrading monitoring service to clients. Since the cost of multicasting this information to a largeaudience might become prohibitive; the broker could outsource the stock feed to third-partyproviders; who are in turn responsible for forwarding the appropriate sub-feed to clients.Evidently; in critical applications the integrity of the third-party should not be taken forgranted.

Elastic translation invariant matching of trajectories,Michail Vlachos; George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract We investigate techniques for analysis and retrieval of object trajectories. Weassume that a trajectory is a sequence of two or three dimensional points. Trajectorydatasets are very common in environmental applications; mobility experiments; videosurveillance and are especially important for the discovery of certain biological patterns.Such kind of data usually contain a great amount of noise; that makes all previously usedmetrics fail. Therefore; here we formalize non-metric similarity functions based on theLongest Common Subsequence (LCSS); which are very robust to noise and furthermoreprovide an intuitive notion of similarity between trajectories by giving more weight to thesimilar portions of the sequences. Stretching of sequences in time is allowed; as well asglobal translating of the sequences in space. Efficient approximate algorithms that …,Machine Learning,2005,72

The goal is to mine temporal arrangements of event intervals thatappear frequently in the database. The motivation of this work is the observation that inpractice most events are not instantaneous but occur over a period of time and differentevents may occur concurrently. Thus; there are many practical applications that requiremining such temporal correlations between intervals including the linguistic analysis ofannotated data from American Sign Language as well as network and biological data.

Similar to the problem of clusteringstandard graphs; probabilistic graph clustering has numerous applications; such as findingcomplexes in probabilistic protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and discovering groupsof users in affiliation networks. We extend the edit-distance-based definition of graphclustering to probabilistic graphs. We establish a connection between our objective functionand correlation clustering to propose practical approximation algorithms for our problem. Abenefit of our approach is that our objective function is parameter-free. Therefore; thenumber of clusters is part of the output. We also develop methods for testing the statisticalsignificance of the output clustering and study the case of noisy clusterings.

Embedding-based subsequence matching in time-series databases,Panagiotis Papapetrou; Vassilis Athitsos; Michalis Potamias; George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract We propose an embedding-based framework for subsequence matching in time-series databases that improves the efficiency of processing subsequence matching queriesunder the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance measure. This framework partiallyreduces subsequence matching to vector matching; using an embedding that maps eachquery sequence to a vector and each database time series into a sequence of vectors. Thedatabase embedding is computed offline; as a preprocessing step. At runtime; given a queryobject; an embedding of that object is computed online. Relatively few areas of interest areefficiently identified in the database sequences by comparing the embedding of the querywith the database vectors. Those areas of interest are then fully explored using the exactDTW-based subsequence matching algorithm. We apply the proposed framework to …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2011,63
Indexing mobile objects using dual transformations,George Kollios; Dimitris Papadopoulos; Dimitrios Gunopulos; J Tsotras,Abstract With the recent advances in wireless networks; embedded systems; and GPStechnology; databases that manage the location of moving objects have received increasedinterest. In this paper; we present indexing techniques for moving object databases. Inparticular; we propose methods to index moving objects in order to efficiently answer rangequeries about their current and future positions. This problem appears in real-lifeapplications such as predicting future congestion areas in a highway system or allocatingmore bandwidth for areas where a high concentration of mobile phones is imminent.

Query-sensitive embeddings,Vassilis Athitsos; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; George Kollios; Stan Sclaroff,Abstract A common problem in many types of databases is retrieving the most similarmatches to a query object. Finding these matches in a large database can be too slow to bepractical; especially in domains where objects are compared using computationallyexpensive similarity (or distance) measures. Embedding methods can significantly speed-upretrieval by mapping objects into a vector space; where distances can be measured rapidlyusing a Minkowski metric. In this article we present a novel way to improve embeddingquality. In particular; we propose to construct embeddings that use a query-sensitivedistance measure for the target space of the embedding. This distance measure is used tocompare those vectors that the query and database objects are mapped to. The term “query-sensitive” means that the distance measure changes; depending on the current query …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2007,46
Performance evaluation of spatio-temporal selectivity estimation techniques,Marios Hadjieleftheriou; George Kollios; VT Tsotras,Many novel spatio-temporal applications deal with moving objects. In such environments; adatabase typically maintains the initial position and the moving function for each object.Instead of updating the database whenever an object position changes (which is notmanageable); updates are issued whenever the moving function deviates beyond a giventhreshold. For simplicity; we assume that objects move with linear trajectories. Maintainingthe moving functions in a database introduces novel problems. For example; the databasecan answer queries about object positions in the future:" find all objects that will be in area A;10 minutes from now". In this paper we present a thorough performance evaluation oftechniques for estimating the selectivity of such queries. We consider various existingestimators that can be stored in main memory and are updated dynamically.

Robust approximate aggregation in sensor data management systems,Jeffrey Considine; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; Feifei Li; John Byers; George Kollios,Abstract In the emerging area of sensor-based systems; a significant challenge is to developscalable; fault-tolerant methods to extract useful information from the data the sensorscollect. An approach to this data management problem is the use of sensor databasesystems; which allow users to perform aggregation queries such as MIN; COUNT; and AVGon the readings of a sensor network. In addition; more advanced queries such as frequencycounting and quantile estimation can be supported. Due to energy limitations in sensor-based networks; centralized data collection is generally impractical; so most systems use in-network aggregation to reduce network traffic. However; even these aggregation strategiesremain bandwidth-intensive when combined with the fault-tolerant; multipath routingmethods often used in these environments. To avoid this expense; we investigate the use …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2009,41
Close pair queries in moving object databases,Panfeng Zhou; Donghui Zhang; Betty Salzberg; Gene Cooperman; George Kollios,Abstract Databases of moving objects are important for air traffic control; ground traffic; andbattlefield configurations. We introduce the (historical and spatial) range close-pair query formoving objects as an important problem for such databases. The purpose of a range close-pair query for moving objects is to find pairs of objects that were closer than ε during timeinterval $ I $ and within spatial range R; where ε; I and R are user-specified parameters. Thispaper solves the range close-pair query using two components: the retrieval component andthe close-pair identification component. The retrieval component breaks up long trajectoriesinto trajectory segments; which are produced in increasing time order; without the need forsorting. The retrieval component takes advantage of a new index mechanism; the MultipleTSB-tree. The segments are then pipelined to the close-pair identification component …,Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international workshop on Geographic information systems,2005,41
Modular order-preserving encryption; revisited,Charalampos Mavroforakis; Nathan Chenette; Adam O'Neill; George Kollios; Ran Canetti,Abstract Order-preserving encryption (OPE) schemes; whose ciphertexts preserve thenatural ordering of the plaintexts; allow efficient range query processing over outsourcedencrypted databases without giving the server access to the decryption key. Such schemeshave recently received increased interest in both the database and the cryptographiccommunities. In particular; modular order-preserving encryption (MOPE); due to Boldyrevaet al.; is a promising extension that increases the security of the basic OPE by introducing asecret modular offset to each data value prior to encrypting it. However; executing rangequeries via MOPE in a naive way allows the adversary to learn this offset; negating anypotential security gains of this approach. In this paper; we systematically address thisvulnerability and show that MOPE can be used to build a practical system for executing …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,36
Small synopses for group-by query verification on outsourced data streams,Ke Yi; Feifei Li; Graham Cormode; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; George Kollios; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract Due to the overwhelming flow of information in many data stream applications; dataoutsourcing is a natural and effective paradigm for individual businesses to address theissue of scale. In the standard data outsourcing model; the data owner outsources streamingdata to one or more third-party servers; which answer queries posed by a potentially largenumber of clients on the data owner's behalf. Data outsourcing intrinsically raises issues oftrust; making outsourced query assurance on data streams a problem with importantpractical implications. Existing solutions proposed in this model all build upon cryptographicprimitives such as signatures and collision-resistant hash functions; which only work forcertain types of queries; for example; simple selection/aggregation queries. In this article; weconsider another common type of queries; namely;“GROUP BY; SUM” queries; which …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2009,36
An efficient approximation scheme for data mining tasks,George Kollios; D Gunupulos; Nick Koudas; Stefan Berchtold,We investigate the use of biased sampling according to the density of the dataset; to speedup the operation of general data mining tasks; such as clustering and outlier detection inlarge multidimensional datasets. In density biased sampling; the probability that a givenpoint will be included in the sample depends on the local density of the dataset. We proposea general technique for density-biased sampling that can factor in user requirements tosample for properties of interest; and can be tuned for specific data mining tasks. This allowsgreat flexibility and improved accuracy of the results over simple random sampling. Wedescribe our approach in detail; we analytically evaluate it; and show how it can beoptimized for approximate clustering and outlier detection.

Generic attacks on secure outsourced databases,Georgios Kellaris; George Kollios; Kobbi Nissim; Adam O'Neill,Abstract Recently; various protocols have been proposed for securely outsourcing databasestorage to a third party server; ranging from systems with" full-fledged" security based onstrong cryptographic primitives such as fully homomorphic encryption or oblivious RAM; tomore practical implementations based on searchable symmetric encryption or even ondeterministic and order-preserving encryption. On the flip side; various attacks haveemerged that show that for some of these protocols confidentiality of the data can becompromised; usually given certain auxiliary information. We take a step back and identify aneed for a formal understanding of the inherent efficiency/privacy trade-off in outsourceddatabase systems; independent of the details of the system.

Characterizing and exploiting reference locality in data stream applications,Feifei Li; Ching Chang; George Kollios; Azer Bestavros,In this paper; we investigate a new approach to process queries in data stream applications.We show that reference locality characteristics of data streams could be exploited in thedesign of superior and flexible data stream query processing techniques. We identify twodifferent causes of reference locality: popularity over long time scales and temporalcorrelations over shorter time scales. An elegant mathematical model is shown to preciselyquantify the degree of those sources of locality. Furthermore; we analyze the impact oflocality-awareness on achievable performance gains over traditional algorithms onapplications such asMAX-subset approximate sliding window join and approximate countestimation. In a comprehensive experimental study; we compare several existing algorithmsagainst our locality-aware algorithms over a number of real datasets. The results validate …,Data Engineering; 2006.

Robust sketching and aggregation of distributed data streams,Marios Hadjieleftheriou; John W Byers; John Kollios,The data streaming model provides an attractive framework for one-pass summarization ofmassive data sets at a single observation point. However; in an environment where multipledata streams arrive at a set of distributed observation points; sketches must be computedremotely and then must be aggregated through a hierarchy before queries may beconducted. As a result; many sketch-based methods for the single stream case do not applydirectly; as either the error introduced becomes large; or because the methods assume thatthe streams are non-overlapping. These limitations hinder the application of thesetechniques to practical problems in network traffic monitoring and aggregation in sensornetworks. To address this; we develop a general framework for evaluating and enablingrobust computation of duplicate-sensitive aggregate functions (eg; SUM and QUANTILE) …,*,2005,29
GRECS: graph encryption for approximate shortest distance queries,Xianrui Meng; Seny Kamara; Kobbi Nissim; George Kollios,Abstract We propose graph encryption schemes that efficiently support approximate shortestdistance queries on large-scale encrypted graphs. Shortest distance queries are one of themost fundamental graph operations and have a wide range of applications. Using suchgraph encryption schemes; a client can outsource large-scale privacy-sensitive graphs to anuntrusted server without losing the ability to query it. Other applications include encryptedgraph databases and controlled disclosure systems. We propose GRECS (stands for GRaphEnCryption for approximate Shortest distance queries) which includes three oracleencryption schemes that are provably secure against any semi-honest server.

Reference-based alignment in large sequence databases,Panagiotis Papapetrou; Vassilis Athitsos; George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract This paper introduces a novel method; called Reference-Based String Alignment(RBSA); that speeds up retrieval of optimal subsequence matches in large databases ofsequences under the edit distance and the Smith-Waterman similarity measure. RBSAoperates using the assumption that the optimal match deviates by a relatively small amountfrom the query; an amount that does not exceed a prespecified fraction of the query length.RBSA has an exact version that guarantees no false dismissals and can handle largequeries efficiently. An approximate version of RBSA is also described; that achievessignificant additional improvements over the exact version; with negligible losses in retrievalaccuracy. RBSA performs filtering of candidate matches using precomputed alignmentscores between the database sequence and a set of fixed-length reference sequences.

Randomized synopses for query assurance on data streams,Ke Yi; Feifei Li; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; George Kollios; Divesh Srivastava,The overwhelming flow of information in many data stream applications forces manycompanies to outsource to a third-party the deployment of a Data Stream ManagementSystem (DSMS) for performing desired computations. Remote computations intrinsicallyraise issues of trust; making query execution assurance on data streams a problem withpractical implications. Consider a client observing the same data stream as a remote server(eg; network traffic); that registers a continuous query on the server's DSMS; and receivesanswers upon request. The client needs to verify the integrity of the results using significantlyfewer resources than evaluating the query locally.

Spatio-temporal join selectivity,Jimeng Sun; Yufei Tao; Dimitris Papadias; George Kollios,Abstract Given two sets S 1; S 2 of moving objects; a future timestamp tq; and a distancethreshold d; a spatio-temporal join retrieves all pairs of objects that are within distance d at tq. The selectivity of a join equals the number of retrieved pairs divided by the cardinality ofthe Cartesian product S 1× S 2. This paper develops a model for spatio-temporal joinselectivity estimation based on rigorous probabilistic analysis; and reveals the factors thataffect the selectivity. Initially; we solve the problem for 1D (point and rectangle) objectswhose location and velocities distribute uniformly; and then extend the results to multi-dimensional spaces. Finally; we deal with non-uniform distributions using a specializedspatio-temporal histogram. Extensive experiments confirm that the proposed formulae arehighly accurate (average error below 10%).,Information Systems,2006,25
The cache inference problem and its application to content and request routing,Nikolaos Laoutaris; Georgios Zervas; Azer Bestavros; George Kollios,In many networked applications; independent caching agents cooperate by servicing eachother's miss streams; without revealing the operational details of the caching mechanismsthey employ. Inference of such details could be instrumental for many other processes. Forexample; it could be used for optimized forwarding (or routing) of one's own miss stream (orcontent) to available proxy caches; or for making cache-aware resource managementdecisions. In this paper; we introduce the cache inference problem (CIP) as that of inferringthe characteristics of a caching agent; given the miss stream of that agent.

Hashing methods for temporal data,George Kollios; Vassilis J Tsotras,External dynamic hashing has been used in traditional database systems as a fast methodfor answering membership queries. Given a dynamic set S of objects; a membership queryasks whether an object with identity k is in (the most current state of) S. This paperaddresses the more general problem of temporal hashing. In this setting; changes to thedynamic set are time-stamped and the membership query has a temporal predicate; as in:"Find whether object with identity k was in set S at time t". We present an efficient solution forthis problem that takes an ephemeral hashing scheme and makes it partially persistent. Oursolution; also termed partially persistent hashing; uses a space that is linear on the totalnumber of changes in the evolution of set S and has a small {O [log/sub B/(n/B)]} queryoverhead.

The first one is entropy-based and uses an existing recursive segmentationtechnique to split the input sequence into a set of homogeneous segments. The key idea ofthe second approach is to use a set of sliding windows over the sequence. Each slidingwindow keeps a set of statistics of a sequence segment that mainly includes the number ofoccurrences of each item in that segment. Combining these statistics efficiently yields thecomplete set of regions of high occurrence of the items of the given alphabet. Afteridentifying these regions; the sequence is converted to a sequence of labeled intervals(each one corresponding to a region).

To address these two problems we introduce a distributed storage manager formultidimensional data based on a Cluster-of-Workstations. The manager addresses theabove challenges through a set of mechanisms that; through selective on-line datareorganization; collectively maintain a balanced load across a cluster of workstations. Withthe help of both a highly efficient and speedy self-tuning mechanism; based on a new datastructure called stat-index; as well as a query aggregation and clustering algorithm; our …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2009,4
Indexing mobile objects using duality transforms,Dimitris Papadopoulos; George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vassilis J.  Tsotras,Abstract We present techniques to index mobile objects in order to efficiently answer rangequeries about their future positions. This problem appears in real-life applications; such aspredicting future congestion areas in a highway system; or allocating more bandwidth forcells where high concentration of mobile phones is impending. We address the problem inexternal memory and present dynamic solutions; both for the one-dimensional; as well asthe two-dimensional cases. Our approach transforms the problem into a dual space that iseasier to index. Finally we discuss advantages and disadvantages among the variousschemes proposed in literature for indexing mobile objects.,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2002,4
Indexing Animated Objects.,George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract We examine the problem of indexing objects in animated movies. We consider ananimated movie as consisting of a frame sequence where each frame is described byobjects in a 2-dimensional space. The queries of interest are of the form:\nd the objects thatwere in area S between frames fi and fj". The straightforward approach to index such objectsis to consider the frame sequence as another dimension and use a 3-dimensional accessmethod (like an R-tree) to index all objects. Instead we propose to reduce the problem to apartial-persistence problem; that is; use a 2-dimensional access method that is madepartially persistent. We show that this approach leads to faster query time while still usingspace proportional to the total number of changes in the frame evolution.,Multimedia Information Systems,1999,4
Hashing methods for temporal data,George Kollios; Vassilis J Tsotras,ABSTRACT External dynamic hashing has been used in traditional database systems as afast method to answer membership queries. Given a dynamic set S of objects; a membershipquery asks whether an object with identity k is in the most current S. This paper addressesthe more general problem of Temporal Hashing. In this setting changes to the dynamic setare timestamped and the membership query has a temporal predicate; as in:“find whetherobject with identity k was in the set S at time t”. We present an efficient solution to theTemporal Hashing problem. Our solution; also termed partially persistent hashing; behavesas if a separate; ephemeral (ie; non-temporal) dynamic hashing scheme is available onevery state assumed by set S over time. However if the buckets of these hashing schemeswere to be stored for each time of interest; the space would become prohibitively large …,History,1998,4
Accessing data while preserving privacy,Georgios Kellaris; George Kollios; Kobbi Nissim; Adam O'Neill,Abstract: As organizations struggle with vast amounts of data; outsourcing sensitive data tothird parties becomes a necessity. To protect the data; various cryptographic techniques areused in outsourced database systems to ensure data privacy; while allowing efficientquerying. Recent attacks on such systems demonstrate that outsourced database systemsmust trade-off efficiency and privacy. Towards designing systems that strike a good balancebetween these two aspects; we present a new model of differentially private outsourceddatabase systems; where differential privacy is preserved at the record level even against anuntrusted server that controls data and queries. Beginning with an atomic storage modelwhere the server can observe both the memory access pattern and communication volume;we provide upper-and lower-bounds on the efficiency of differentially private outsourced …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.01552,2017,3
The Cache Inference Problem and its Application to Content and Request Routing (Extended Version,Nikolaos Laoutaris; Georgios Zervas; Azer Bestavros; George Kollios,Abstract—In many networked applications; independent caching agents cooperate byservicing each other's miss streams; without revealing the operational details of the cachingmechanisms they employ. Inference of such details could be instrumental for many otherprocesses. For example; it could be used for optimized forwarding (or routing) of one's ownmiss stream (or content) to available proxy caches; or for making cache-aware resourcemanagement decisions. In this paper; we introduce the Cache Inference Problem (CIP) asthat of inferring the characteristics of a caching agent; given the miss stream of that agent.While CIP is insolvable in its most general form; there are special cases of practicalimportance in which it is; including when the request stream follows an IndependentReference Model (IRM) with generalized power-law (GPL) demand distribution.

Randomized synopses for query verification on data streams,K Yi; F Li; Marios Hadjieleftheriou; D Srivastava; G Kollios,ABSTRACT Due to the overwhelming flow of information in many data stream applications;many companies may not be willing to acquire the necessary resources for deploying a DataStream Management System (DSMS); choosing; alternatively; to outsource the data streamand the desired computations to a third-party. But data outsourcing and remotecomputations intrinsically raise issues of trust; making outsourced query verification on datastreams a problem with important practical implications. Consider a setting where acontinuous “GROUP BY; SUM” query is processed using a remote; untrusted server.

Filtering methods for similarity-based multimedia retrieval,Vassilis Athitsos; Jonathan Alon; Stan Sclaroff; George Kollios,Abstract. A common problem in multimedia databases is retrieving the most similar matchesto a query object. Finding those matches can be too slow to be practical; especially indomains where comparing multimedia objects involves computationally expensive similarity(or distance) measures. Filter-and-refine retrieval is a framework for addressing thisproblem: the filter step quickly filters out most database objects; and the refine step identifiesthe best matches among the remaining candidates. This paper describes two filteringmethods; that work by constructing efficient approximations of computationally expensivesimilarity measures. The first method can be applied to arbitrary domains; and the secondmethod explicitly targets domains where measuring similarity includes an alignmentprocess. The benefits of these two filtering methods are illustrated in experiments with …,International workshop on audio-visual content and information visualization in digital libraries (AVIVDiLib),2005,2

On the generation of 2-dimensional index workloads,Joseph M Hellerstein; Lisa Hellerstein; George Kollios,Abstract A large number of database index structures have been proposed over the last twodecades; and little consensus has emerged regarding their relative effectiveness. In order toempirically evaluate these indexes; it is helpful to have methodologies for generatingrandom queries for performance testing. In this paper we propose a domain-independentapproach to the generation of random queries: choose randomly among all logically distinctqueries. We investigate this idea in the context of range queries over 2-dimensional points.We present an algorithm that chooses randomly among logically distinct 2-d range queries.It has constant-time expected performance over uniformly distributed data; and exhibitedgood performance in experiments over a variety of real and synthetic data sets.

GreedyDual-Join: Locality-aware buffer management for approximate join processing over data streams,Ching Chang; Feifei Li; Azer Bestavros,We investigate adaptive buffer management techniques for approximate evaluation ofsliding window joins over multiple data streams. In many applications; data streamprocessing systems have limited memory or have to deal with very high speed data streams.In both cases; computing the exact results of joins between these streams may not befeasible; mainly because the buffers used to compute the joins contain much smallernumber of tuples than the tuples contained in the sliding windows. Therefore; a stream buffermanagement policy is needed in that case. We show that the buffer replacement policy is animportant determinant of the quality of the produced results. To that end; we proposeGreedyDual-Join (GDJ) an adaptive and locality-aware buffering technique for managingthese buffers.

Embedding-based Subsequence Matching in Time Series Databases,VASSILIS ATHITSOS; MICHALIS POTAMIAS; GEORGE KOLLIOS; DIMITRIOS GUNOPULOS,We propose an embedding-based framework for subsequence matching in time seriesdatabases that improves the efficiency of processing subsequence matching queries underthe Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance measure. This framework partially reducessubsequence matching to vector matching; using an embedding that maps each querysequence to a vector and each database time series into a sequence of vectors. Thedatabase embedding is computed off-line; as a preprocessing step. At runtime; given aquery object; an embedding of that object is computed online. Relatively few areas ofinterest are efficiently identified in the database sequences by comparing the embedding ofthe query with the database vectors. Those areas of interest are then fully explored using theexact DTW-based subsequence matching algorithm. We apply the proposed framework …,*,2011,*
Privacy Preservation on Time Series,Spiros Papadimitriou; Feifei Li; George Kollios; S Yu Philip,Time series data are sequence of values based on observations at periodic time instantsand appear in a wide range of domains and applications; such as financial; retail;environmental and process monitoring; defense and health care. Additionally; massivevolumes of data from various sources are continuously collected. However; when a dataowner wants to publish this data he may not be willing to exactly reveal the true values dueto various reasons; most notably privacy considerations. A widely employed and acceptedapproach for partial information hiding is based on random perturbation [4]; whichintroduces uncertainty about individual values.

Spatio-Temporal Selectivity Estimation,George Kollios,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains.

A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}.

Generalized Methods for Discovering Frequent Poly-Regions in DNA,Panagiotis Papapetrou; Gary Benson; George Kollios,The problem of discovering frequent poly-regions (ie regions of high occurrence of a set ofitems or patterns of a given alphabet) in a sequence is studied; and three efficientapproaches are proposed to solve it. The first one is entropy-based and applies a recursivesegmentation technique that produces a set of candidate segments which may potentiallylead to a poly-region. The key idea of the second approach is the use of a set of slidingwindows over the sequence. Each sliding window covers a sequence segment and keeps aset of statistics that mainly include the number of occurrences of each item or pattern in thatsegment. Combining these statistics efficiently yields the complete set of poly-regions in thegiven sequence.

Discovering Clusters in Motion Time-Series Data (Preprint),Jonathan Alon; Stan Sclaroff; George Kollios; Vladimir Pavlovic,Abstract: A new approach is proposed for clustering time-series data. The approach can beused to discover groupings of similar object motions that were observed in a videocollection. A finite mixture of hidden Markov models (HMMs) is fitted to the motion data usingthe expectation-maximization (EM) framework. Previous approaches for HMM-basedclustering employ a k-means formulation; where each sequence is assigned to only a singleHMM. In contrast; the formulation presented in this paper allows each sequence to belong tomore than a single HMM with some probability; and the hard decision about the sequenceclass membership can be deferred until a later time when such a decision is required.Experiments with simulated data demonstrate the benefit of using this EM-based approachwhen there is more overlap in the processes generating the data.

SSTD 2007received 76 submissions from 19 countries (based on the affiliation of the first author). Athorough review process led to the acceptance of 26 high-quality papers; geographically …,*,*,*

ж щ ы п╧ бс р,Feifei Li; Ching Chang; Azer Bestavros; George Kollios,Abstract We investigate adaptive buffer management techniques for approximate evaluationof sliding window joins over multiple data streams. In many applications; data streamprocessing systems have limited memory or have to deal with very high speed data streams.In both cases; computing the exact results of joins between these streams may not befeasible; mainly because the buffers used to compute the joins contain much smallernumber of tuples than the tuples contained in the sliding windows. Therefore; a stream buffermanagement policy is needed in that case. We show that the buffer replacement policy is animportant determinant of the quality of the produced results. To that end; we proposeGreedyDual-Join (GDJ) an adaptive and locality-aware buffering technique for managingthese buffers. GDJ exploits the temporal correlations (at both long and short time scales) …,*,*,*

In density-biased sampling; the probability that a givenpoint will be included in the sample depends on the local density of the dataset. We proposea general technique for density-biased sampling that can factor in user requirements tosample for properties of interest; and can be tuned for specific data mining tasks. This allowsgreat flexibility; and improved accuracy of the results over simple random sampling. Wedescribe our approach in detail; we analytically evaluate it; and show how it can beoptimized for approximate clustering and outlier detection. Finally we present a thoroughexperimental evaluation of the proposed method; applying density-biased sampling on …,*,*,*
Q-Database: Dimensionality Reduction and Efficient Retrieval of Medical Images from Large Databases,K Arshad; M Betke; G Kollios,Abstract Q-Database (Q-DB) refers to a system which involves pre-processing medicalimages to extract features for efficient storage into a database. In this paper; we develop asystem which uses feature reduction/selection (using Branch-and-Bound; Las Vegas Filter;FastMap; etc…). After this; the images are stored in a database that is efficient for fastretrievals. This method is compared with many similar techniques available to determinewhich is best in terms of efficiency (time to process; and accuracy). This system can easily beautomated so that there is no human involvement until the very end to interpret the results.This system may help doctors to evaluate and treat similar symptoms of patients andprescribe better treatments which have more likelihood of success based on other doctors'evaluation and experiences in similar situations. This may also help avoid intraobserver …,*,*,*

Multidimensional Membership Queries for Temporal Databases,Lifei Tan; Vassilis J Tsotras; George Kollios; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Abstract Consider a dynamic set of multidimensional objects S; that evolves over time. Atemporal membership query asks whether an object with given key attributes was in the setS at some time t. This paper provides efficient solutions to this temporal query. In particular;we present partially persistent extensions to (i) a hashing based scheme-the BANG file and(ii) the hB-tree. The performance of both methods is compared with a persistent R-tree andan ephemeral R tree. Our experiments show the efficiency of the proposed methods.,*,*,*
THE CACHE INFERENCE PROBLEM,NIKOLAOS LAOUTARIS; GEORGIOS ZERVAS; AZER BESTAVROS; GEORGE KOLLIOS,Abstract—In many networked applications; independent caching agents cooperate byservicing each other's miss streams; without revealing the operational details of the cachingmechanisms they employ. Inference of such details could be instrumental for many otherprocesses. For example; it could be used for optimized forwarding (or routing) of one's ownmiss stream (or content) to available proxy caches; or for making cache-aware resourcemanagement decisions. In this paper; we introduce the Cache Inference Problem (CIP) asthat of inferring the characteristics of a caching agent; given the miss stream of that agent.While CIP is insolvable in its most general form; there are special cases of practicalimportance in which it is; including when the request stream follows an IndependentReference Model (IRM) with generalized power-law (GPL) demand distribution.
