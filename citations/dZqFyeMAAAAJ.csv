Online influence maximization (extended version),Siyu Lei; Silviu Maniu; Luyi Mo; Reynold Cheng; Pierre Senellart,Abstract: Social networks are commonly used for marketing purposes. For example; freesamples of a product can be given to a few influential social network users (or" seednodes"); with the hope that they will convince their friends to buy it. One way to formalizemarketers' objective is through influence maximization (or IM); whose goal is to find the bestseed nodes to activate under a fixed budget; so that the number of people who getinfluenced in the end is maximized. Recent solutions to IM rely on the influence probabilitythat a user influences another one. However; this probability information may be unavailableor incomplete. In this paper; we study IM in the absence of complete information on influenceprobability. We call this problem Online Influence Maximization (OIM) since we learninfluence probabilities at the same time we run influence campaigns. To solve OIM; we …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.01188,2015,50
Building a signed network from interactions in Wikipedia,Silviu Maniu; Bogdan Cautis; Talel Abdessalem,Abstract We present in this paper results on inferring a signed network (a" web of trust") frominteractions on user-generated content in Wikipedia. From a collection of articles in thepolitics domain and their revision history; we investigate mechanisms by which relationshipsbetween Wikipedia contributors-in the form of signed directed links-can be inferred basedtheir interactions. Our study sheds light into principles underlying a signed network that iscaptured by social interaction. We look into whether this network over Wikipedia contributorsrepresents indeed a plausible configuration of link signs. We assess connections to socialtheories such as structural balance and status; which have already been considered inonline communities. We also evaluate on this network the accuracy of a learned predictor foredge signs.

Discovering meta-paths in large heterogeneous information networks,Changping Meng; Reynold Cheng; Silviu Maniu; Pierre Senellart; Wangda Zhang,Abstract The Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) is a graph data model in whichnodes and edges are annotated with class and relationship labels. Large and complexdatasets; such as Yago or DBLP; can be modeled as HINs. Recent work has studied how tomake use of these rich information sources. In particular; meta-paths; which representsequences of node classes and edge types between two nodes in a HIN; have beenproposed for such tasks as information retrieval; decision making; and productrecommendation. Current methods assume meta-paths are found by domain experts.However; in a large and complex HIN; retrieving meta-paths manually can be tedious anddifficult. We thus study how to discover meta-paths automatically. Specifically; users areasked to provide example pairs of nodes that exhibit high proximity. We then investigate …,Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web,2015,34
Network-aware search in social tagging applications: instance optimality versus efficiency,Silviu Maniu; Bogdan Cautis,Abstract We consider in this paper top-k query answering in social applications; with a focuson social tagging. This problem requires a significant departure from socially agnostictechniques. In a network-aware context; one can (and should) exploit the social links; whichcan indicate how users relate to the seeker and how much weight their tagging actionsshould have in the result build-up. We propose algorithms that have the potential to scale tocurrent applications. While the problem has already been considered in previous literature;this was done either under strong simplifying assumptions or under choices that cannotscale to even moderate-size real-world applications. We first revisit a key aspect of theproblem; which is accessing the closest or most relevant users for a given seeker. Wedescribe how this can be done on the fly (without any pre-computations) for several …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,32
On optimality of jury selection in crowdsourcing,Yudian Zheng; Reynold Cheng; Silviu Maniu; Luyi Mo,Recent advances in crowdsourcing technologies enable computationally challenging tasks(eg; sentiment analysis and entity resolution) to be performed by Internet workers; drivenmainly by monetary incentives. A fundamental question is: how should workers be selected;so that the tasks in hand can be accomplished successfully and economically? In this paper;we study the Jury Selection Problem (JSP): Given a monetary budget; and a set of decision-making tasks (eg;“Is Bill Gates still the CEO of Microsoft now?”); return the set of workers(called jury); such that their answers yield the highest “Jury Quality”(or JQ). Existing JSPsolutions make use of the Majority Voting (MV) strategy; which uses the answer chosen bythe largest number of workers. We show that MV does not yield the best solution for JSP. Wefurther prove that among all voting strategies (including deterministic and randomized …,Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Extending Database Technology; EDBT 2015,2015,31

Taagle: Efficient; personalized search in collaborative tagging networks,Silviu Maniu; Bogdan Cautis,Abstract We demonstrate the Taagle system for top-k retrieval in social tagging systems(also known as folksonomies). The general setting is the following: users form a weightedsocial network; which may reflect friendship; similarity; or trust; items from a public pool ofitems (eg; URLs; blogs; photos; documents) are tagged by users with keywords; userssearch for the top-k items having certain tags. Going beyond a classic search paradigmwhere data is decoupled from the users querying it; users can now act both as producersand seekers of information. Hence finding the most relevant items in response to a queryshould be done in a network-aware manner: items tagged by users who are closer (moresimilar) to the seeker should be given more weight than items tagged by distant users. Weillustrate with Taagle novel algorithms and a general approach that has the potential to …,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,17
ProbTree: A query-efficient representation of probabilistic graphs,Silviu Maniu; Reynold Cheng; Pierre Senellart,Information in many applications; such as mobile wireless systems; social networks; androad networks; is captured by graphs; in many cases uncertain.

Scalable; generic; and adaptive systems for focused crawling,Georges Gouriten; Silviu Maniu; Pierre Senellart,Abstract Focused crawling is the process of exploring a graph iteratively; focusing on parts ofthe graph relevant to a given topic. It occurs in many situations such as a company collectingdata on competition; a journalist surfing the Web to investigate a political scandal; or anarchivist recording the activity of influential Twitter users during a presidential election. In allthese applications; users explore a graph (eg; the Web or a social network); nodes arediscovered one by one; the total number of exploration steps is constrained; some nodes aremore valuable than others; and the objective is to maximize the total value of the crawledsubgraph. In this article; we introduce scalable; generic; and adaptive systems for focusedcrawling. Our first effort is to define an abstraction of focused crawling applicable to a largedomain of real-world scenarios. We then propose a generic algorithm; which allows us to …,Proceedings of the 25th ACM conference on Hypertext and social media,2014,12
Scalable algorithms for nearest-neighbor joins on big trajectory data,Yixiang Fang; Reynold Cheng; Wenbin Tang; Silviu Maniu; Xuan Yang,Trajectory data are prevalent in systems that monitor the locations of moving objects. In alocation-based service; for instance; the positions of vehicles are continuously monitoredthrough GPS; the trajectory of each vehicle describes its movement history. We study joinson two sets of trajectories; generated by two sets M and R of moving objects. For each entityin M; a join returns its k nearest neighbors from R. We examine how this query can beevaluated in cloud environments. This problem is not trivial; due to the complexity of thetrajectory; and the fact that both the spatial and temporal dimensions of the data have to behandled. To facilitate this operation; we propose a parallel solution framework based onMapReduce. We also develop a novel bounding technique; which enables trajectories to bepruned in parallel. Our approach can be used to parallelize existing single-machine …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,11
Search behaviour on photo sharing platforms,Silviu Maniu; Neil O'Hare; Luca Maria Aiello; Luca Chiarandini; Alejandro Jaimes,The behaviour; goals; and intentions of users while searching for images in large scaleonline collections are not well understood; with image search log analysis providing limitedinsights; in part because they tend only to have access to user search and result clickinformation. In this paper we study user search behaviour in a large photo-sharing platform;analyzing all user actions during search sessions (ie including post result-click pageviews).Search accounts for a significant part of user interactions with such platforms; and we showdifferences between the queries issued on such platforms and those on general imagesearch. We show that search behaviour is influenced by the query type; and also dependson the user. Finally; we analyse how users behave when they reformulate their queries; anddevelop URL class prediction models for image search; showing that query-specific …,Multimedia and Expo (ICME); 2013 IEEE International Conference on,2013,9

In many cases; such information is uncertain. Westudy the problem of querying a probabilistic graph; in which vertices are connected to eachother probabilistically. In particular; we examine “source-to-target” queries (ST-queries);such as computing the shortest path between two vertices. The major difference with thedeterministic setting is that query answers are enriched with probabilistic annotations.Evaluating ST-queries over probabilistic graphs is &num; P-hard; as it requires examiningan exponential number of “possible worlds”—database instances generated from theprobabilistic graph.

itag: Incentive-based tagging,Siyu Lei; Xuan S Yang; Luyi Mo; Silviu Maniu; Reynold Cheng,In social tagging systems; such as Delicious 1 and Flickr 2; users are allowed to annotateresources (eg; Web URLs and images) with textual descriptions called tags. Tags haveproven to be invaluable building blocks in algorithms for searching; mining andrecommending resources. In practice; however; not all resources receive the same attentionfrom users; and as a result; most tags are added to the few highly-popular resources; whilemost of the resources receive few tags. Crucially; this incomplete tagging on resources canseverely affect the effectiveness of all tagging applications. We present iTag; an incentive-based tagging system; which aims at improving tagging quality of resources; by incentivizingtaggers under budget constraints. Our system is built upon traditional crowdsourcingsystems such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk).

Context-aware top-k processing using views,Silviu Maniu; Bogdan Cautis,Abstract Search applications where queries are dependent on their context are becomingincreasingly relevant in today's online applications. For example; the context may be thelocation of the user in location-aware search or the social network of the query initiator insocial-aware search. Processing such queries efficiently is inherently difficult; and requirestechniques that go beyond the existing; context-agnostic ones. A promising direction forefficient; online answering--especially in the case of top-k queries--is to materialize andexploit previous query results (views). We consider context-aware query optimization basedon views; focusing on two important sub-problems. First; handling the possible differences incontext between the various views and an input query leads to view results having uncertainscores; ie; score ranges valid for the new context. As a consequence; current top-k …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,2

Effective large-scale online influence maximization,Paul Lagrée; Olivier Cappé; Bogdan Cautis; Silviu Maniu,Abstract—In this paper; we study a highly generic version of influence maximization (IM);one of optimizing influence campaigns by sequentially selecting “spread seeds” from a set ofcandidates; a small subset of the node population; under the hypothesis that; in a givencampaign; previously activated nodes remain “persistently” active throughout and thus donot yield further rewards. We call this problem online influence maximization withpersistence. We introduce an estimator on the candidates' missing mass–the expectednumber of nodes that can still be reached from a given seed candidate–and justify itsstrength to rapidly estimate the desired value. We then describe a novel algorithm; GT-UCB;relying on upper confidence bounds on the missing mass. We show that our approach leadsto high-quality spreads on classic IM datasets; even though it makes almost no …,International Conference on Data Mining,2017,1
Challenges for Efficient Query Evaluation on Structured Probabilistic Data,Antoine Amarilli; Silviu Maniu; Mikaël Monet,Abstract Query answering over probabilistic data is an important task but is generallyintractable. However; a new approach for this problem has recently been proposed; basedon structural decompositions of input databases; following; eg; tree decompositions. Thispaper presents a vision for a database management system for probabilistic data builtfollowing this structural approach.

Intensional data on the web,Antoine Amarilli; Silviu Maniu; Pierre Senellart,Abstract We call data intensional when it is not directly available; but must be accessedthrough a costly interface. Intensional data naturally arises in a number of Web datamanagement scenarios; such as Web crawling or ontology-based data access. Suchscenarios require us to model an uncertain view of the world; for which; given a query; wemust answer the question" What is the best thing to do next?" Once data has been retrieved;the knowledge of the world is revised; and the whole process is repeated; until enoughknowledge about the world has been obtained for the particular application considered. Inthis article; we give an overview of the steps underlying all intensional data managementscenarios; and illustrate them on three concrete applications: focused crawling; onlineinfluence maximization in social networks; and mining crowdsourced data.,ACM Sigweb Newsletter,2015,1

Quantifying trust dynamics in signed graphs; the S-Cores approach,Christos Giatsidis; Bogdan Cautis; Silviu Maniu; Dimitrios M Thilikos; Michalis Vazirgiannis,Abstract Lately; there has been an increased interest in signed networks with applications intrust; security; or social computing. This paper focuses on the issue of defining models andmetrics for reciprocity in signed graphs. In unsigned directed networks; reciprocity quantifiesthe predisposition of network members in creating mutual connections. On the other hand;this concept has not yet been investigated in the case of signed graphs. We capitalize on thegraph degeneracy concept to identify subgraphs of the signed network in which reciprocity ismore likely to occur. This enables us to assess reciprocity at a global level; rather than at anexclusively local one as in existing approaches. The large scale experiments we perform onreal world data sets of trust networks lead to both interesting and intuitive results. We believethese reciprocity measures can be used in various social applications such as trust …,*,2014,1

Scalable Evaluation of k-NN Queries on Large Uncertain Graphs,Xiaodong Li; Reynold Cheng; Yixiang Fang; Jiafeng Hu; Silviu Maniu,Graphs are prevalent in social networks [10; 12]; traffic networks [11]; biological networks[31]; and mobile ad-hoc networks [13]. Due to noisy measurements [1]; hardware limitation[2]; inference models [9]; and privacy-preserving perturbation [4; 21]; these graphs areinherently uncertain. To model this error; the uncertain graph has been studied [1; 6; 15; 18].In this graph; each edge is associated with a probability distribution. Figure 1 (a) shows theprotein-protein interaction (PPI) network as an uncertain graph; where each node denotes aprotein; and each edge is an interaction between a pair of proteins. The value on each edgedenotes the probability that the interaction exists (called existence probability). For instance;the existential probability that the interaction between nodes A and B exists is 0.7. k-NNquery.

An Experimental Study of the Treewidth of Real-World Graph Data,Silviu Maniu; Pierre Senellart; Inria Paris; Télécom ParisTech LTCI; Suraj Jog,Treewidth is a parameter that measures how tree-like a relational instance is; and whether itcan reasonably be decomposed into a tree. Many computation tasks are known to betractable on databases of small treewidth; but computing the treewidth of a given instance isintractable. This article is the first large-scale study of treewidth and tree decompositions ofreal-world graph instances (24 datasets from 8 different domains; with sizes ranging from afew thousand to a few million nodes). The goal is to determine which data; if any; can benefitof the wealth of algorithms for databases of small treewidth. For each dataset; we obtainupper and lower bound estimations of their treewidth; and study the properties of their treedecompositions. Our main finding is that graphs of relatively low treewidth,*,2017,*

We start by considering social search in tagging (orbookmarking) applications. This problem requires a significant departure from existing;socially agnostic techniques.
