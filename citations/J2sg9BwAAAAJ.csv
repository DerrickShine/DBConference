XSEarch: A semantic search engine for XML,Sara Cohen; Jonathan Mamou; Yaron Kanza; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract XSEarch; a semantic search engine for XML; is presented. XSEarch has a simplequery language; suitable for a naive user. It returns semantically related documentfragments that satisfy the user's query. Query answers are ranked using extendedinformation-retrieval techniques and are generated in an order similar to the ranking.Advanced indexing techniques were developed to facilitate efficient implementation ofXSEarch. The performance of the different techniques as well as the recall and the precisionwere measured experimentally. These experiments indicate that XSEarch is efficient;scalable and ranks quality results highly.,Proceedings of the 29th international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 29,2003,753
Rewriting aggregate queries using views,Sara Cohen; Werner Nutt; Alexander Serebrenik,We investigate the problem of rewriting queries with aggregate operators using views thatmay or may not contain aggregate operators. A rewriting of a query is a second query thatuses view predicates such that evaluating first the views and then the rewriting yields thesame result as evaluating the original query. In this sense; the original query and therewriting are equivalent modulo the view definitions. The queries and views we considercorrespond to unnested SQL queries; possibly with union; that employ the operators min;max; count; and sum.,Proceedings of the eighteenth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1999,181
Interconnection semantics for keyword search in XML,Sara Cohen; Yaron Kanza; Benny Kimelfeld; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract A framework for describing semantic relationships among nodes in XML documentsis presented. In contrast to earlier work; the XML documents may have ID references (ie;they correspond to graphs and not just trees). A specific interconnection semantics in thisframework can be defined explicitly or derived automatically. The main advantage ofinterconnection semantics is the ability to pose queries on XML data in the style of keywordsearch. Several methods for automatically deriving interconnection semantics arepresented. The complexity of the evaluation and the satisfiability problems under the derivedsemantics is analyzed. For many important cases; the complexity is tractable and hence; theproposed interconnection semantics can be efficiently applied to real-world XML documents.,Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2005,96
EquiX Easy Querying in XML Databases.,Sara Cohen; Yaron Kanza; Yakov A Kogan; Werner Nutt; Yehoshua Sagiv; Alexander Serebrenik,The Web is explored by many users; but only a few of them have experience in using querylanguages. Thus; one of the greatest challenges; provided by XML; is to create a querylanguage simple enough for the naive user. In this paper; we present EquiX| a powerful andeasy to use query language for XML. The main goal in designing EquiX is to strike the rightbalance between expressive power and simplicity. EquiX has a form-based GUI that isconstructed automatically from the DTDs of XML documents. Query forms are built from wellknown HTML primitives. The result of a query in EquiX is a collection of XML documents;and it is automatically generated from the query without explicit speci cation of the format ofthe result. Knowledge of XML syntax is not required in order to use EquiX. Yet; EquiX is ableto express rather complicated queries; containing quanti cation; negation and …,WebDB (Informal Proceedings),1999,64
Incorporating constraints in probabilistic XML,Sara Cohen; Benny Kimelfeld; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract Constraints are important; not only for maintaining data integrity; but also becausethey capture natural probabilistic dependencies among data items. A probabilistic XMLdatabase (PXDB) is the probability subspace comprising the instances of a p-document thatsatisfy a set of constraints. In contrast to existing models that can express probabilisticdependencies; it is shown that query evaluation is tractable in PXDBs. The problems ofsampling and determining well-definedness (ie; whether the aforesaid subspace isnonempty) are also tractable. Furthermore; queries and constraints can include theaggregate functions count; max; min; and ratio. Finally; this approach can be easilyextended to allow a probabilistic interpretation of constraints.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2009,58
Jerusalem,Sara Cohen; Lior Ebel; Benny Kimelfeld,Abstract Social networks are ubiquitous; with online networks garnering a large portion ofWeb traffic. Both online and offline; social networks structures are an interesting data sourcewhose importance has been recognized for over a hundred years. Research on socialnetwork analysis has dealt with properties of entire networks; in addition to properties ofnodes or sets of nodes. A user queries a social network in pursuit of a desired outcome;such as an expert on a specific medical condition; a set of influential people to promote anew product; or a well-balanced group of database experts to form a program committee.The user may know what the desired outcome is; and may even be able to express it in aformal query language; given the right abstract predicates to represent typical social-networkmeasures (eg; the importance of a node or its relevance to some keywords). However …,*,1977,56
Running tree automata on probabilistic XML,Sara Cohen; Benny Kimelfeld; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract Tree automata (specifically; bottom-up and unranked) form a powerful tool forquerying and maintaining validity of XML documents. XML with uncertain data can bemodeled as a probability space of labeled trees; and that space is often represented by atree with distributional nodes. This paper investigates the problem of evaluating a treeautomaton over such a representation; where the goal is to compute the probability that theautomaton accepts a random possible world. This problem is generally intractable; but forthe case where the tree automaton is deterministic (and its transitions are defined bydeterministic string automata); an efficient algorithm is presented. The paper discusses theapplications of this result; including the ability to sample and to evaluate queries (eg; inmonadic second-order logic) while requiring a-priori conformance to a schema (eg; DTD) …,Proceedings of the twenty-eighth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2009,55
Rewriting queries with arbitrary aggregation functions using views,Sara Cohen; Werner Nutt; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract The problem of rewriting aggregate queries using views is studied for conjunctivequeries with arbitrary aggregation functions and built-in predicates. Two types of queriesover views are introduced for rewriting aggregate queries: pure candidates and aggregatecandidates. Pure candidates can be used to rewrite arbitrary aggregate queries. Aggregatecandidates can be used to rewrite queries containing aggregate functions definable in termsof a commutative-semigroup operation. For both types of candidates (as well as for severalrelaxations of these candidates); the unfolding property holds. This allows characterizationsfor query equivalence to be used to determine whether a candidate is a rewriting of a query.The complexity of the rewriting-existence problem is also studied and upper and lowercomplexity bounds are given.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2006,52
Deciding equivalences among conjunctive aggregate queries,Sara Cohen; Werner Nutt; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract Equivalence of aggregate queries is investigated for the class of conjunctivequeries with comparisons and the aggregate operators count; count-distinct; min; max; andsum. Essentially; this class contains unnested SQL queries with the above aggregateoperators; with a where clause consisting of a conjunction of comparisons; and without ahaving clause. The comparisons are either interpreted over a domain with a dense order(like the rationals) or with a discrete order (like the integers). Characterizations ofequivalence differ for the two cases. For queries with either max or min; equivalence ischaracterized in terms of dominance mappings; which can be viewed as a generalization ofcontainment mappings. For queries with the count-distinct operator; a sufficient condition forequivalence is given in terms of equivalence of conjunctive queries under set semantics …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2007,47
Algorithms for rewriting aggregate queries using views,Sara Cohen; Werner Nutt; Alexander Serebrenik,Abstract Queries involving aggregation are typical in database applications. One of the mainideas to optimize the execution of an aggregate query is to reuse results of previouslyanswered queries. This leads to the problem of rewriting aggregate queries using views.Due to a lack of theory; algorithms for this problem were rather ad-hoc. They were sound; butwere not proven to be complete. Recently we have given syntactic characterizations for theequivalence of aggregate queries and applied them to decide when there exist rewritings.However; these decision procedures do not lend themselves immediately to animplementation. In this paper; we present practical algorithms for rewriting queries withcount and sum. Our algorithms are sound. They are also complete for important cases. Ourtechniques can be used to improve well-known procedures for rewriting non-aggregate …,*,2000,46
User-defined aggregate functions: bridging theory and practice,Sara Cohen,Abstract The ability to create user-defined aggregate functions (UDAs) is rapidly becoming astandard feature in relational database systems. Therefore; problems such as queryoptimization; query rewriting and view maintenance must take into account queries (orviews) with UDAs. There is a wealth of research on these problems for queries with generalaggregate functions. Unfortunately; there is a mismatch between the manner in which UDAsare created; and the information that the database system requires in order to apply previousresearch. The purpose of this paper is to explore this mismatch and to bridge the gapbetween theory and practice; thereby enabling UDAs to become first-class citizens within thedatabase. Specifically; we consider query optimization; query rewriting and viewmaintenance for queries with UDAs. For each of these problems we first survey previous …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,43
Containment of aggregate queries,Sara Cohen; Werner Nutt; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract The problem of deciding containment of aggregate queries is investigated.Containment is reduced to equivalence for queries with expandable aggregation functions.Many common aggregation functions; such as max; cntd (count distinct); count; sum; avg;median and stdev (standard deviation) are shown to be expandable. It is shown that even inthe presence of integrity constraints; containment can be reduced to equivalence. Forconjunctive count and sum-queries; simpler characterizations for containment are given; thatdo not require checking equivalence. These results are built upon in order to solve theproblem of finding maximally-contained sets of rewritings for conjunctive count-queries.,International Conference on Database Theory,2003,42
Equivalences among aggregate queries with negation,Sara Cohen; Yehoshua Sagiv; Werner Nutt,Abstract Query equivalence is investigated for disjunctive aggregate queries with negatedsubgoals; constants and comparisons. A full characterization of equivalence is given for theaggregation functions count; max; sum; prod; top2 and parity. A related problem is that ofdetermining; for a given natural number N; whether two given queries are equivalent over alldatabases with at most N constants. This problem is called bounded equivalence. Acomplete characterization of decidability of bounded equivalence is given. In particular; it isshown that this problem is decidable for all the above aggregation functions as well as forcntd (count distinct) and avg. For quasilinear queries (ie; queries in which predicates thatoccur positively are not repeated); it is shown that equivalence can be decided in polynomialtime for the aggregation functions count; max; sum; prty; prod; top2 and avg.

EquiX—a search and query language for XML,Sara Cohen; Yaron Kanza; Yakov Kogan; Yehoshua Sagiv; Werner Nutt; Alexander Serebrenik,Abstract EquiX is a search language for XML that combines the power of querying with thesimplicity of searching. Requirements for such languages are discussed; and it is shown thatEquiX meets the necessary criteria. Both a graph-based abstract syntax and a formalconcrete syntax are presented for EquiX queries. In addition; the semantics is defined andan evaluation algorithm is presented. The evaluation algorithm is polynomial undercombined complexity. EquiX combines pattern matching; quantification; and logicalexpressions to query both the data and meta-data of XML documents. The result of a queryin EquiX is a set of XML documents. A DTD describing the result documents is derivedautomatically from the query.,Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology,2002,38
On ranking techniques for desktop search,Sara Cohen; Carmel Domshlak; Naama Zwerdling,Abstract Users tend to store huge amounts of files; of various formats; on their personalcomputers. As a result; finding a specific; desired file within the file system is a challengingtask. This article addresses the desktop search problem by considering various techniquesfor ranking results of a search query over the file system. First; basic ranking techniques;which are based on various file features (eg; file name; access date; file size; etc.); areconsidered and their effectiveness is empirically analyzed. Next; two learning-based rankingschemes are presented; and are shown to be significantly more effective than the basicranking methods. Finally; a novel ranking technique; based on query selectiveness; isconsidered for use during the cold-start period of the system. This method is also shown tobe empirically effective; even though it does not involve any learning.,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2008,30
Full disjunctions: Polynomial-delay iterators in action,Sara Cohen; Itzhak Fadida; Yaron Kanza; Benny Kimelfeld; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract Full disjunctions are an associative extension of the outer-join operator to anarbitrary number of relations. Their main advantage is the ability to maximally combine datafrom different relations while preserving all the original information. An algorithm forefficiently computing full disjunctions is presented. This algorithm is superior to previousones in three ways. First; it is the first algorithm that computes a full disjunction with apolynomial delay between tuples. Hence; it can be implemented as an iterator that producesa stream of tuples; which is important in many cases (eg; pipelined query processing andWeb applications). Second; the total runtime is linear in the size of the output. Third; thealgorithm employs a novel optimization that divides the relation schemes into biconnectedcomponents; uses a separate iterator for each component and applies outerjoins …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,29
Containment of aggregate queries,Sara Cohen,Abstract It is now common for databases to contain many gigabytes; or even many terabytes;of data. Scientific experiments in areas such as high energy physics produce data sets ofenormous size; while in the business sector the emergence of decision-support systems anddata warehouses has led organizations to build up gigantic collections of data. Aggregatequeries allow one to retrieve concise information from such a database; since they can covermany data items while returning a small result. OLAP queries; used extensively in datawarehousing; are based almost entirely on aggregation [4; 16]. Aggregate queries have alsobeen studied in a variety of settings beyond relational databases; such as mobile computing[1]; global information systems [21]; stream data analysis [12]; sensor networks [22] andconstraint databases [2].,ACM SIGMOD Record,2005,26
Equivalence of queries combining set and bag-set semantics,Sara Cohen,Abstract The query equivalence problem has been studied extensively for set-semanticsand; more recently; for bag-set semantics. However; SQL queries often combine set and bag-set semantics. For example; an SQL query that returns a multiset of elements may call asubquery or view that returns a set of elements. As another example; in SQL one cancompute a multiset-union of queries; each of which returns a set of answers. This paperpresents combined semantics; which formally models query evaluation combining set andbag-set semantics. The equivalence problem for queries evaluated under combinedsemantics is studied. A sufficient condition for equivalence is presented. For severalimportant common classes of queries necessary and sufficient conditions for equivalenceare presented.,Proceedings of the twenty-fifth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,2006,24
Generating XML structure using examples and constraints,Sara Cohen,Abstract This paper presents a framework for automatically generating structural XMLdocuments. The user provides a target DTD and an example of an XML document; called aGenerate-XML-By-Example Document; or a GxBE document; for short. GxBE documents usea natural declarative syntax; which includes XPath expressions and the function count.Using GxBE documents; users can express important global and local characteristics for thedesired target documents; and can require satisfaction of XPath expressions from a givenworkload. This paper explores the problem of efficiently generating a document that satisfiesa given DTD and GxBE document.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,21
A survey on proximity measures for social networks,Sara Cohen; Benny Kimelfeld; Georgia Koutrika,Abstract Measuring proximity in a social network is an important task; with many interestingapplications; including person search and link prediction. Person search is the problem offinding; by means of keyword search; relevant people in a social network. In user-centricperson search; the search query is issued by a person participating in the social networkand the goal is to find people that are relevant not only to the keywords; but also to thesearcher herself. Link prediction is the task of predicting new friendships (links) that arelikely to be added to the network. Both of these tasks require the ability to measure proximityof nodes within a network; and are becoming increasingly important as social networksbecome more ubiquitous. This chapter surveys recent work on scoring measures fordetermining proximity between nodes in a social network. We broadly identify various …,*,2012,20
Equivalence of queries that are sensitive to multiplicities,Sara Cohen,Abstract The query equivalence problem has been studied extensively for set-semanticsand; more recently; for bag and bag-set semantics. However; SQL queries often combineset; bag and bag-set semantics. For example; an SQL query that returns a multiset ofelements may call a subquery or view that returns a set of elements. Queries may accessboth relations that do not contain duplicates; as well as relations with duplicates. As anotherexample; in SQL one can compute a multiset-union of queries; each of which returns a set ofanswers. This paper presents combined semantics; which formally models query evaluationcombining set; bag and bag-set semantics. The equivalence problem for queries evaluatedunder combined semantics is studied.

Generating relations from XML documents,Sara Cohen; Yaron Kanza; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract This paper discusses several mechanisms for creating relations out of XMLdocuments. A relation generator consists of two parts:(1) a tuple of path expressions and (2)an index indicating which path expressions may not be assigned the null value. Evaluating arelation generator involves finding tuples of nodes that satisfy the path expressions and arerelated to one another in a meaningful fashion. Different semantics for evaluation are giventhat take into account the possible presence of incomplete information. The complexity ofgenerating relations from documents is analyzed and evaluation algorithms are described.,International Conference on Database Theory,2003,19
Generating all maximal induced subgraphs for hereditary and connected-hereditary graph properties,Sara Cohen; Benny Kimelfeld; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract This paper investigates a graph enumeration problem; called the maximal P-subgraphs problem; where P is a hereditary or connected-hereditary graph property.Formally; given a graph G; the maximal P-subgraphs problem is to generate all maximalinduced subgraphs of G that satisfy P.

Querying parse trees of stochastic context-free grammars,Sara Cohen; Benny Kimelfeld,Abstract Stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) have long been recognized as useful fora large variety of tasks including natural language processing; morphological parsing;speech recognition; information extraction; Web-page wrapping and even analysis of RNA.A string and an SCFG jointly represent a probabilistic interpretation of the meaning of thestring; in the form of a (possibly infinite) probability space of parse trees. The problem ofevaluating a query over this probability space is considered under the conventionalsemantics of querying a probabilistic database. For general SCFGs; extremely simplequeries may have results that include irrational probabilities. But; for a large subclass ofSCFGs (that includes all the standard studied subclasses of SCFGs) and the language oftree-pattern queries with projection (and child/descendant edges); it is shown that query …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Database Theory,2010,16
An incremental algorithm for computing ranked full disjunctions,Sara Cohen; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract The full disjunction is a variation of the join operator that maximally combines tuplesfrom connected relations; while preserving all information in the relations. The fulldisjunction can be seen as a natural extension of the binary outerjoin operator to an arbitrarynumber of relations and is a useful operator for information integration. This paper presentsthe algorithm IncrementalFD for computing the full disjunction of a set of relations.IncrementalFD improves upon previous algorithms for computing the full disjunction in fourways. First; it has a lower total runtime when computing the full result and a lower runtimewhen computing only k tuples of the result; for any constant k. Second; for a natural class ofranking functions; IncrementalFD can be adapted to return tuples in ranking order. Third; avariation of IncrementalFD can be used to return approximate full disjunctions (which …,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,2007,16
Flexible XML querying using skyline semantics,Sara Cohen; Maayan Shiloach,Preferences over results of an XML query are of two distinct flavors. First; the user may preferresults which contain desired values; eg; lower prices; favorite foods; higher ratings. Second;the user may prefer results with a certain structure; eg; existence of a" discount" node;existence of an edge (and not only a path) between" departure" and" arrival" nodes. The firsttype of preference has been studied extensively over relational data; using skylinesemantics; but has barely been considered for XML. The second type of preference hasbeen studied for XML in the context of inexact querying; using scoring functions to rankresults. This paper presents a query language for XML that incorporates both value-basedand structural desires. Skyline semantics is used to determine optimal results. Algorithms forquery evaluation under skyline semantics are presented and experimentation proves …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,15

In addition; the semantics is defined. It isshown that EquiX has an evaluation algorithm that is polynomial under combinedcomplexity.

Efficient enumeration of maximal k-plexes,Devora Berlowitz; Sara Cohen; Benny Kimelfeld,Abstract The problem of enumerating (ie; generating) all maximal cliques in a graph hasreceived extensive treatment; due to the plethora of applications in various areas such asdata mining; bioinformatics; network analysis and community detection. However; requiringthe enumerated subgraphs to be full cliques is too restrictive in common real-life scenarioswhere" almost cliques" are equally useful. Hence; the notion of a k-plex; a clique relaxationthat allows every node to be" missing" k neighbors; has been introduced. But this seeminglyminor relaxation casts existing algorithms for clique enumeration inapplicable; for inherentreasons. This paper presents the first provably efficient algorithms; both for enumerating themaximal k-plexes and for enumerating the maximal connected k-plexes. Our algorithms runin polynomial delay for a constant k and incremental FPT delay when k is a parameter …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,14
Indexing for subtree similarity-search using edit distance,Sara Cohen,Abstract Given a tree Q and a large set of trees T={T 1;...; T n}; the subtree similarity-searchproblem is that of finding the subtrees of trees among T that are most similar to Q; using thetree edit distance metric. Determining similarity using tree edit distance has been provenuseful in a variety of application areas. While subtree similarity-search has been studied inthe past; solutions required traversal of all of T; which poses a severe bottleneck inprocessing time; as T grows larger. This paper proposes the first index structure for subtreesimilarity-search; provided that the unit cost function is used. Extensive experimentation andcomparison to previous work shows the huge improvement gained when using theproposed index structure and processing algorithm.,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,14
Certain and possible XPath answers,Sara Cohen; Yaacov Y Weiss,Abstract Formulating an XPath query over an XML document is a difficult chore for a non-expert user. This paper introduces a novel approach to ease the querying process. Insteadof specifying a query; the user simply marks positive examples χ+ of nodes that fit herinformation need. She may also mark negative examples χ− of undesirable nodes. Adeductive method; to suggest additional nodes that will interest the user; is developed in thispaper. To be precise; a node y is a certain answer if every query returning all positiveexamples χ+; and not returning any negative example from χ−; must also return y. Similarly;y is a possible answer if there exists a query returning χ+ and y; while not returning any nodein χ−. Thus; y is likely to be of interest to the user if y is a certain answer; and unlikely to be ofinterest if y is not even a possible answer.

Learning tree patterns from example graphs,Sara Cohen; Yaacov Y Weiss,Abstract This paper investigates the problem of learning tree patterns that return nodes witha given set of labels; from example graphs provided by the user. Example graphs areannotated by the user as being either positive or negative. The goal is then to determinewhether there exists a tree pattern returning tuples of nodes with the given labels in each ofthe positive examples; but in none of the negative examples; and; furthermore; to find onesuch pattern if it exists. These are called the satisfiability and learning problems;respectively. This paper thoroughly investigates the satisfiability and learning problems in avariety of settings. In particular; we consider example sets that (1) may contain only positiveexamples; or both positive and negative examples;(2) may contain directed or undirectedgraphs; and (3) may have multiple occurrences of labels or be uniquely labeled (to some …,LIPIcs-Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics,2015,12
Self-correcting queries for XML,Tali Brodianskiy; Sara Cohen,Abstract It has been observed that queries over XML data sources are often unsatisfiable.Unsatisfiability may stem from several different sources; eg; the user may be insufficientlyfamiliar with the labels appearing the documents; or may not be intimately aware of thehierarchical structure of the documents. This difficulty may be compounded by the fact thaterrors in query formulation lead to an empty answer; and not to some sort of compilationerror. To deal with query and document mismatches; previous research has consideredreturning answers that maximally satisfy (in some sense) the query; instead of only returningstrictly satisfying answers. However; this breaks the golden database rule that only strictlysatisfying answers are returned when querying. Indeed; the relationship between the queryand answers is no longer clear; when unsatisfying answers are returned.

SQL4X: A flexible query language for XML and relational databases,Sara Cohen; Yaron Kanza; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract SQL4X; a powerful language for simultaneously querying both relational and XMLdatabases is presented. Using SQL4X; one can create both relations and XML documentsas query results. Thus; SQL4X can be thought of as an integration language. In order toallow easy integration of XML documents with varied structures; SQL4X uses flexiblesemantics when querying XML. SQL4X is also a powerful query language. It can expressquantification; negation; aggregation; grouping and path expressions. Datalog 4 x and Tree-Datalog 4 x; extensions of Datalog; are defined as elegant abstract models for SQL4Xqueries. Query containment is characterized for many common classes of SQL4X queries.Specifically; for Datalog 4 x queries; a complete characterization of containment ofconjunctive queries and of unions of queries is presented.

A general algorithm for subtree similarity-search,Sara Cohen; Nerya Or,Determining similarity between trees is an important problem in a variety of areas. Thesubtree similarity-search problem is that of finding; given a tree Q and a large set of treesΓ={T 1;...; T n}; the subtrees of trees among Γ that are most similar to Q. Similarity is definedusing some tree distance function. While subtree similarity-search has been studied in thepast; solutions mostly focused on specific tree distance functions; and were usuallyapplicable only to ordered trees. This paper presents an efficient new algorithm that solvesthe subtree similarity-search problem; and is compatible with a wide family of tree distancefunctions (for both ordered and unordered trees). Extensive experimentation confirms theefficiency and scalability of the algorithm; which displays consistently good runtime even forlarge queries and datasets.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,10
Recommending collaborators using keywords,Sara Cohen; Lior Ebel,Abstract This paper studies the problem of recommending collaborators in a social network;given a set of keywords. Formally; given a query q; consisting of a researcher s (who is amember of a social network) and a set of keywords k (eg; an article name or topic of futurework); the collaborator recommendation problem is to return a high-quality ranked list ofpossible collaborators for s on the topic k. Extensive effort was expended to define rankingfunctions that take into consideration a variety of properties; including structural proximity tos; textual relevance to k; and importance. The effectiveness of our methods have beenexperimentally proven over two large subsets of the social network determined by DBLP co-authorship data. The results show that the ranking methods developed in this paper workwell in practice.,Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web,2013,10

On Principles of Egocentric Person Search in Social Networks.,Sara Cohen; Benny Kimelfeld; Georgia Koutrika; Jan Vondrák,ABSTRACT Person search is the problem of finding; by means of keyword search; relevantpeople in a social network. In egocentric person search; the search query is issued by aperson s participating in the social network; and the goal is to find people that possess twoqualities: relevancy to the query; and relevancy to s herself. This position paper considersthe latter quality; and specifically; scoring functions that rank persons by their relevancy to s.In particular; the paper proposes general principles (ie; properties) that should be held bysuch scoring functions. Several functions; which were proposed in the past for measuringnode connectivity; are analyzed with respect to the proposed principles. It is shown thatnone of these functions sufficiently satisfy the principles. In contrast; the paper presents twoadditional functions that satisfy the principles in a strong sense.,VLDS,2011,9
An abstract framework for generating maximal answers to queries,Sara Cohen; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract A framework for modeling query semantics as graph properties is presented. In thisframework; a single definition of a query automatically gives rise to several semantics forevaluating that query under varying degrees of incomplete information. For example;defining natural joins automatically gives rise to full disjunctions. Two of the proposedsemantics have incremental-polynomial-time query-evaluation algorithms for all types ofqueries that can be defined in this framework. Thus; the proposed framework generalizesprevious definitions of semantics for incomplete information and improves previouscomplexity results for query evaluation.,International Conference on Database Theory,2005,9
Implementing link-prediction for social networks in a database system,Sara Cohen; Netanel Cohen-Tzemach,Abstract Storing and querying large social networks is a challenging problem; due both tothe scale of the data; and to intricate querying requirements. One common type of query overa social network is link prediction; which is used to suggest new friends for existing nodes inthe network. There is no gold standard metric for predicting new links. However; past workhas been effective at identifying a number of metrics that work well for this problem. Thesemetrics vastly differ one from another in their computational complexity; eg; they mayconsider a small neighborhood of a node for which new links should be predicted; or theymay perform random walks over the entire social network graph. This paper considers theproblem of implementing metrics for link prediction in a social network over different types ofdatabase systems.

Both online and offline; social networks structures are an interesting datasource whose importance has been recognized for over a hundred years. Research onsocial network analysis has dealt with properties of entire networks; in addition to propertiesof nodes or sets of nodes. A user queries a social network in pursuit of a desired outcome;such as an expert on a specific medical condition; a set of influential people to promote anew product; or a well-balanced group of database experts to form a program committee.The user may know what the desired outcome is; and may even be able to express it in aformal query language; given the right abstract predicates to represent typical social-networkmeasures (eg; the importance of a node or its relevance to some keywords). However …,CIDR,2013,7
On the complexity of tree pattern containment with arithmetic comparisons,Foto N Afrati; Sara Cohen; Gabriel Kuper,Abstract In this paper we investigate the complexity of query containment problem for treepatterns (which express a fragment of XPath) with arbitrary arithmetic comparisons. Weassume that attributes take values from a totally ordered domain and allow constraints thatinvolve arithmetic comparisons. We show that the containment problem is Π 2 P-complete inthe general case; but remains co-NP complete for tree patterns with left semi-interval (<;⩽;=)or right semi-interval (>;⩾;=) attribute constraints.,Information Processing Letters,2011,7
Correcting queries for XML,Sara Cohen; Tali Brodianskiy,Abstract It has been observed that queries over XML data sources are often unsatisfiable.Unsatisfiability may stem from several different sources; eg; the user may be insufficientlyfamiliar with the labels appearing the documents; or may not be intimately aware of thehierarchical structure of the documents. To deal with query and document mismatches;previous research has considered returning answers that maximally satisfy (in some sense)the query; instead of only returning strictly satisfying answers. However; this breaks thegolden database rule that only strictly satisfying answers are returned when querying.Indeed; the relationship between the query and answers is no longer clear; whenunsatisfying answers are returned. To reinstate the golden database rule; this articleproposes a framework for automatically correcting queries over XML. This framework …,Information Systems,2009,7
Predicting email recipients,Zvi Sofershtein; Sara Cohen,Abstract The ability to accurately predict recipients of an email; while it is being composed; isof great practical importance for two reasons. First; prediction of recipients allows foreffective" auto-complete" of this field; thereby improving user experience and reducing theoverhead of manual typing of the recipient. Second; this capability allows the system to alertthe user when she has typed unlikely recipients. Such alerts can help avoid human error thatmight result in forgetting relevant recipients; or; even worse; disclosure of personal orclassified information. In this demonstration; a system that effectively predicts emailrecipients; given an email history; will be exhibited. The system takes into consideration avariety of email related features to achieve high accuracy. Extensive experimentation ondiverse email corpora has shown that our system adapts well to a variety of domains …,Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining 2015,2015,5
Bag equivalence of XPath queries,Sara Cohen; Yaacov Y Weiss,Abstract When a query is evaluated under bag semantics; each answer is returned as manytimes as it has derivations. Bag semantics has long been recognized as important;especially when aggregation functions will be applied to query results. This paper is the firstto focus on bag semantics for XPath queries. In particular; the problem of bag-equivalence ofa large class of XPath queries (modeled as tree patterns) is explored. The queries cancontain unions; branching; label wildcards; the vertical child and descendant axes; thehorizontal following; following-sibling and immediately-following sibling axes; as well aspositional (ie; first and last) axes. Equivalence characterizations are provided; and theircomplexity is analyzed. As the descendent axis involves a recursive relationship; this paperis also the first to address bag equivalence over recursive queries; in any setting.,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Database Theory,2010,4
Datalog programs over infinite databases; revisited,Sara Cohen; Joseph Yossi Gil; Evelina Zarivach,Abstract This paper's revisit of infinite relational databases; a model traditionally perceivedas purely theoretical; was sparked by a concrete implementation setting; and the resultsobtained here were used in a practical database problem. In the course of implementing adatabase system for querying Java software; we found that the universe of Java code can beeffectively modeled as an infinite database. This modeling makes it possible to distinguishbetween queries which are “open-ended;” that is; whose result may grow as softwarecomponents are added into the system; and queries which are “closed;” in that their resultdoes not change as the software base grows. Further; closed queries can be implementedmuch more efficiently than open queries. Achievements include an algorithm fordistinguishing between these two kinds of queries (we assume that queries are written in …,International Symposium on Database Programming Languages,2007,4
Equivalence; containment and rewriting of aggregate queries,Sara Cohen; שרה כהן,Abstract The primary goal of this thesis is to lay the theoretical foundations for a formal studyof aggregate query optimization. This requires gaining a coherent understanding ofequivalences and containments between aggregate queries of varied forms. A secondarygoal of this thesis is to solve the view usability problem for varied types of aggregate queries.The view usability problem is that of determining whether it is possible to find a reformulationof a query that uses other queries; instead of base relations. This is of importance in queryoptimization; since it enables reuse of previously computed results. It is also a necessitywhen integrating information from heterogeneous sources; when each source is describedas a view over a global schema. In order to achieve the primary goal; the general problem ofdetermining equivalences among aggregate queries is considered. Our aggregate …,*,2004,4
Searching in an XML corpus using content and structure,Yiftah Ben-Aharon; Sara Cohen; Yael Grumbach; Yaron Kanza; Jonathan Mamou; Yehoshua Sagiv; Benjamin Sznajder; Efrat Twito,ABSTRACT This paper presents a system for XML retrieval. The approach consists of avariety of Information Retrieval techniques augmented with the ability to give weights todifferent fragments of a document; based on the tags. Specifically; term frequencies; inversedocument frequencies; proximity among occurrences ofkeywords; and similarity betweenkeywords and words from the given document; are used. Each technique has beenimplemented as a separate ranker and the final ranking is done by merging the results of thevarious rankers. 1. INTRODUCTION An XML document has a structure in addition to content;and an XML search engine should be capable of taking advantage of the structure in orderto improve the quality (ie; precision and recall) of the results. The structure may also beincorporated into the topic (ie; query) in two ways. First; the topic may include conditions …,INEX 2003 Workshop Proceedings,2003,4
Verifying equivalence of Spark programs,Shelly Grossman; Sara Cohen; Shachar Itzhaky; Noam Rinetzky; Mooly Sagiv,Abstract Apache Spark is a popular framework for writing large scale data processingapplications. Our long term goal is to develop automatic tools for reasoning about Sparkprograms. This is challenging because Spark programs combine database-like relationalalgebraic operations and aggregate operations; corresponding to (nested) loops; with UserDefined Functions (UDF s). In this paper; we present a novel SMT-based technique forverifying the equivalence of Spark programs. We model Spark as a programming languagewhose semantics imitates Relational Algebra queries (with aggregations) over bags(multisets) and allows for UDFs expressible in Presburger Arithmetics. We prove that theproblem of checking equivalence is undecidable even for programs which use a singleaggregation operator. Thus; we present sound techniques for verifying the equivalence of …,International Conference on Computer Aided Verification,2017,3
A personalized GeoSocial app for surviving an earthquake,Shlomo Bekhor; Sara Cohen; Yerach Doytsher; Yaron Kanza; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract Earthquakes are sudden; cause huge damage to extensive areas; and maynegatively affect the lives of millions of people. Thus; it is crucial to develop a system thatcan help people survive an earthquake and recover from its aftereffects. In this paper wepresent a vision of a smartphone app; called EAGA (earthquake alerter and guidance app);that will guide both victims and rescue workers; by leveraging probabilistic geosocialinformation collected before the event; during the earthquake and in its aftermath. The apphas four modes of operation. In standby mode; EAGA collects data about users; theirregularly visited locations and their social relations. In alert mode; EAGA warns of animpending earthquake; based on data collected from a variety of sensors and fromgovernment warning systems. It also provides initial guidance to the user during the onset …,Proceedings of the 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on the Use of GIS in Emergency Management,2015,3
An Axiomatic Approach to Link Prediction.,Sara Cohen; Aviv Zohar,Abstract Link prediction functions are important tools that are used to predict the evolution ofa network; to locate hidden or surprising links; and to recommend new connections thatshould be formed. Multiple link prediction functions have been developed in the past.However; their evaluation has mostly been based on experimental work; which has shownthat the quality of a link prediction function varies significantly depending on the inputdomain. There is currently very little understanding of why and how a specific link predictionfunction works well for a particular domain. The underlying foundations of a link predictionfunction are often left informal—each function contains implicit assumptions about thedynamics of link formation; and about structural properties that result from these dynamics.We draw upon the motivation used in characterizations of ranking algorithms; as well as …,AAAI,2015,3
Generating RDF for application testing,Daniel Blum; Sara Cohen,Abstract. Application testing is a critical component of application development. Testing ofSemantic Web applications requires large RDF datasets; conforming to an expected form orschema; and preferably; to an expected data distribution. Finding such datasets often provesimpossible; while generating input datasets is often cumbersome. The GRR (GeneratingRandom RDF) system is a convenient; yet powerful; tool for generating random RDF; basedon a SPARQL-like syntax. In this poster and demo; we show how large datasets can beeasily generated using intuitive commands.,9th International Semantic Web Conference ISWC 2010,2010,3
On ranking techniques for desktop search,Sara Cohen; Carmel Domshlak; Naama Zwerdling,ABSTRACT This paper addresses the desktop search problem by considering varioustechniques for ranking results of a search query over the file system. First; basic rankingtechniques; which are based on a single file feature (eg; file name; file content; access date;etc.) are considered. Next; two learning-based ranking schemes are presented; and areshown to be significantly more effective than the basic ranking methods. Finally; a novelranking technique; based on query selectiveness is considered; for use during the cold-startperiod of the system. This method is also shown to be empirically effective; even though itdoes not involve any learning.,Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web,2007,3
Count-Constraints for generating XML,Sara Cohen,Abstract The problem of automatically generating XML documents that satisfy given userconstraints is considered. Specifically; given (1) a count-constraint C; expressed usingXPath and the aggregate function count and (2) a DTD D; the problem of generating an XMLdocument that satisfies both C and D is studied. Classes of count-constraints and DTDs forwhich the satisfiability problem is polynomial are identified. For these classes it is shown thata satisfying document can be generated efficiently in terms of the input and the output.,International Workshop on Next Generation Information Technologies and Systems,2006,3
Generating All Maximal Induced Subgraphs for Hereditary; Connected-Hereditary and Rooted-Hereditary Properties,Sara Cohen; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract: The problem of computing all maximal induced subgraphs of a graph G that have agraph property P; also called the maximal P-subgraphs problem; is considered. Thisproblem is studied for hereditary; connected-hereditary and rooted-hereditary graphproperties. The maximal P-subgraphs problem is reduced to restricted versions of thisproblem by providing algorithms that solve the general problem; assuming that an algorithmfor a restricted version is given. The complexity of the algorithms are analyzed in terms oftotal polynomial time; incremental polynomial time and the complexity class P-enumerable.The general results presented allow simple proofs that the maximal P-subgraphs problemcan be solved efficiently (in terms of the input and output) for many different properties.Subjects: Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.

Select-project queries over XML documents,Sara Cohen; Yaron Kanza; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract This paper discusses evaluation of select-project (SP) queries over an XMLdocument. A SP query consists of two parts:(1) a conjunction of conditions on values oflabels (called the selection) and (2) a series of labels whose values should be outputed(called the projection). Query evaluation involves finding tuples of nodes that have the labelsmentioned in the query and are related to one another other in a meaningful fashion.Several different semantics for query evaluation are given in this paper. Some of thesesemantics also take into account the possible presence of incomplete information. Thecomplexity of query evaluation is analyzed and evaluation algorithms are described.,International Workshop on Next Generation Information Technologies and Systems,2002,2
Reverse engineering spj-queries from examples,Yaacov Y Weiss; Sara Cohen,Abstract This paper investigates the problem of reverse engineering; ie; learning; select-project-join (SPJ) queries from a user-provided example set; containing positive andnegative tuples. The goal is then to determine whether there exists a query returning all thepositive tuples; but none of the negative tuples; and furthermore; to find such a query; if itexists. These are called the satisfiability and learning problems; respectively. The ability tosolve these problems is an important step in simplifying the querying process for non-expertusers. This paper thoroughly investigates the satisfiability and learning problems in a varietyof settings. In particular; we consider several classes of queries; which allow differentcombinations of the operators select; project and join. In addition; we compare thecomplexity of satisfiability and learning; when the query is; or is not; of bounded size.

The complexity of learning tree patterns from example graphs,Sara Cohen; Yaacov Y Weiss,Abstract This article investigates the problem of learning tree patterns that return nodes witha given set of labels; from example graphs provided by the user. Example graphs areannotated by the user as being either positive or negative. The goal is then to determinewhether there exists a tree pattern returning tuples of nodes with the given labels in each ofthe positive examples; but in none of the negative examples; and furthermore; to find onesuch pattern if it exists. These are called the satisfiability and learning problems;respectively. This article thoroughly investigates the satisfiability and learning problems in avariety of settings. In particular; we consider example sets that (1) may contain only positiveexamples; or both positive and negative examples;(2) may contain directed or undirectedgraphs; and (3) may have multiple occurrences of labels or be uniquely labeled (to some …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2016,1

Aggregation: Expressiveness and containment,Sara Cohen,1. Software non-determinism: A software system is non-deterministic if; when re-executed; itresults in a different execution path than a prior execution. Non-determinism can arise when;for example; paths are determined by relative processor speed or the sequence of externalevents. Such software bugs have been called ''Heisenbugs''(hard failures being ''Bohrbugs'').2. Soft hardware failures: Hardware can also suffer from ''Heisenbugs.''For example; atransient hardware failure may be triggered by an environmental cause; such as a cosmicray changing a memory bit; etc. 3. Operator failures: Systems occasionally require operatorintervention. Operators; being human; make mistakes. An operator is unlikely to make thesame mistake at the same point in a subsequent execution.,*,2009,1
Crowdsourcing with Diverse Groups of Users,Sara Cohen; Moran Yashinski,Abstract When crowdsourcing to achieve some goal; or to gather information; there is adistinct advantage to choosing a diverse team of users. Past research has shown theadvantages of diversity in the workplace; as team members bring different perspectives andpoints of view. Similarly; when choosing users from a crowd; user diversity must be takeninto consideration. This paper studies the diverse team formation problem. More precisely;we are given a set of required skills; as wells as a large set of people; each of who has somesubset of the skills. The goal is to form a team satisfying the skills; that is also diverse; as isreflected by differences in the characteristics of team members (eg; gender; race; country ofresidence; economic bracket). We show that finding an optimal (diverse) team of people isan NP-complete problem. In practice; the number of candidates is likely to strongly …,Proceedings of the 20th International Workshop on the Web and Databases,2017,*

Efficiently and effectively finding window representatives,Lana Senyor-Schloss; Sara Cohen,Abstract Increasingly many applications leverage geographic data; and display this data tothe user; eg; to show sites of interest or friends in the vicinity. Given a window of interest; it isoften advantageous to display only a bounded number k of representative points; instead ofthe entire contents of the window. This is helpful as a summary of the window contents. It isalso quite necessary when the screen is small; and the window contains many points; asdisplaying all points will yield an incomprehensible output. This paper presents an approachto finding k representatives of a window. Unlike previous methods; which were based onfetching and clustering the relevant data; in this paper a method is presented for exploitingan existing indexing structure of the data to provide high quality results in efficient time;without explicitly accessing the data in the window.

Deciding Equivalences among Aggregate Queries,Sara Cohen; Werner Nutt; Yehoshua Sagiv,Abstract Equivalence of aggregate queries is investigated for the class of conjunctivequeries with comparisons and the aggregate operators count; count-distinct; min; max; andsum. Essentially; this class contains all unnested SQL queries with the above aggregateoperators; with a WHERE clause consisting of a conjunction of comparisons; and without aHAVING clause. The comparisons are either interpreted over a domain with a dense order(like the rationals) or with a discrete order (like the integers). Characterizations ofequivalence differ for the two cases. For queries with either max or min; equivalence ischaracterized in terms of dominance mappings; which can be viewed as a generalization ofcontainment mappings. For queries with the count-distinct operator; a sufficient condition forequivalence is given in terms of equivalence of conjunctive queries under set semantics …,*,*,*

Equivalence of Real Queries over Real Databases,Sara Cohen,Abstract The query equivalence problem has been studied extensively for set-semanticsand; more recently; for bag and bag-set semantics. However; SQL queries often combineset; bag and bag-set semantics. For example; an SQL query that returns a multiset ofelements may call a subquery or view that returns a set of elements. Queries may accessboth relations that do not contain duplicates; as well as relations with duplicates. As anotherexample; in SQL one can compute a multiset-union of queries; each of which returns a set ofanswers. This paper presents combined semantics; which formally models query evaluationcombining set; bag and bag-set semantics. The equivalence problem for queries evaluatedunder combined semantics is studied. A sufficient condition for equivalence is presented.For several important common classes of queries necessary and sufficient conditions for …,*,*,*

This paperconsiders the problem of content optimization for a Web page and a given set of queries;under the assumption that a TFIDF based content ranking function is used. Documentmodifications have associated costs. The goal is to find a set of modifications that achievethe ranking goal; while having a minimal cost. Several different algorithms are presented;that differ on their runtime and on the scenarios in which they are optimal. Extensiveexperimentation proves that the algorithms are efficient and effective; and thus; are a usefulaid towards semi-automatic content optimization.,*,*,*
