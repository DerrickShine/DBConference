Tree-pattern queries on a lightweight XML processor,Mirella M Moro; Zografoula Vagena; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Popular XML languages; like XPath; use" tree-pattern" queries to select nodesbased on their structural characteristics. While many processing methods have already beenproposed for such queries; none of them has found its way to any of the existing" lightweight"XML engines (ie engines without optimization modules). The main reason is the lack of asystematic comparison of query methods under a common storage model. In this work; weaim to fill this gap and answer two important questions: what the relative similarities andimportant differences among the tree-pattern query methods are; and if there is a prominentmethod among them in terms of effectiveness and robustness that an XML processor shouldsupport. For the first question; we propose a novel classification of the methods according totheir matching process. We then describe a common storage model and demonstrate that …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,67
Collaboration recommendation on academic social networks,Giseli Rabello Lopes; Mirella M Moro; Leandro Krug Wives; José Palazzo Moreira De Oliveira,Abstract In the academic context; scientific research works are often performed throughcollaboration and cooperation between researchers and research groups. Researcherswork in various subjects and in several research areas. Identifying new partners to executejoint research and analyzing the level of cooperation of the current partners can be verycomplex tasks. Recommendation of new collaborations may be a valuable tool forreinforcing and discovering such partners. This paper presents an innovative approach torecommend collaborations on the context of academic Social Networks. Specifically; weintroduce the architecture for such approach and the metrics involved in recommendingcollaborations. We also present an initial case study to validate our approach.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2010,62
Preserving XML queries during schema evolution,Mirella M Moro; Susan Malaika; Lipyeow Lim,Abstract In XML databases; new schema versions may be released as frequently as onceevery two weeks. This poster describes a taxonomy of changes for XML schema evolution. Itexamines the impact of those changes on schema validation and query evaluation. Basedon that study; it proposes guidelines for XML schema evolution and for writing queries insuch a way that they continue to operate as expected across evolving schemas.,Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web,2007,56
Twig query processing over graph-structured xml data,Zografoula Vagena; Mirella M Moro; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract XML and semi-structured data is usually modeled using graph structures. Structuralsummaries; which have been proposed to speedup XML query processing have graphforms as well. The existent approaches for evaluating queries over tree structured data (iedata whose underlying structure is a tree) are not directly applicable when the data ismodeled as a random graph. Moreover; they cannot be applied when structural summariesare employed and; to the best of our knowledge; no analogous techniques have beenreported for this case either. As a result; the potential of structural summaries is not fullyexploited. In this paper; we investigate query evaluation techniques applicable to graph-structured data. We propose efficient algorithms for the case of directed acyclic graphs;which appear in many real world situations. We then tailor our approaches to handle …,Proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on the Web and Databases: colocated with ACM SIGMOD/PODS 2004,2004,48
Early profile pruning on XML-aware publish-subscribe systems,Mirella M Moro; Petko Bakalov; Vassilis J Tsotras,Abstract Publish-subscribe applications are an important class of content-baseddissemination systems where the message transmission is defined by the message content;rather than its destination IP address. With the increasing use of XML as the standard formaton many Internet-based applications; XML aware pub-sub applications become necessary.In such systems; the messages (generated by publishers) are encoded as XML documents;and the profiles (defined by subscribers) as XML query statements. As the number ofdocuments and query requests grow; the performance and scalability of the matching phase(ie matching of queries to incoming documents) become vital. Current solutions have limitedor no flexibility to prune out queries in advance. In this paper; we overcome such limitationby proposing a novel early pruning approach called Bounding-based XML Filtering or …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,42
Sentiment-based influence detection on Twitter,Carolina Bigonha; Thiago NC Cardoso; Mirella M Moro; Marcos A Gonçalves; Virgílio AF Almeida,Abstract The user generated content available in online communities is easy to create andconsume. Lately; it also became strategically important to companies interested in obtainingpopulation feedback on products; merchandising; etc. One of the most important onlinecommunities is Twitter: recent statistics report 65 million new tweets each day. However;processing this amount of data is very costly and a big portion of the content is simply notuseful for strategic analysis. Thus; in order to filter the data to be analyzed; we propose anew method for ranking the most influential users in Twitter. Our approach is based on acombination of the user position in networks that emerge from Twitter relations; the polarityof her opinions and the textual quality of her tweets. Our experimental evaluation shows thatour approach can successfully identify some of the most influential users and that …,Journal of the Brazilian Computer Society,2012,33

Using link semantics to recommend collaborations in academic social networks,Michele A Brandão; Mirella M Moro; Giseli Rabello Lopes; José PM Oliveira,Abstract Social network analysis (SNA) has been explored in many contexts with differentgoals. Here; we use concepts from SNA for recommending collaborations in academicnetworks. Recent work shows that research groups with well connected academic networkstend to be more prolific. Hence; recommending collaborations is useful for increasing agroup's connections; then boosting the group research as a collateral advantage. In thiswork; we propose two new metrics for recommending new collaborations or intensification ofexisting ones. Each metric considers a social principle (homophily and proximity) that isrelevant within the academic context. The focus is to verify how these metrics influence in theresulting recommendations. We also propose new metrics for evaluating therecommendations based on social concepts (novelty; diversity and coverage) that have …,Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web,2013,29
Ranking strategy for graduate programs evaluation,Giseli Rabello Lopes; Mirella M Moro; Roberto Da Silva; Eduardo M Barbosa; José Palazzo Moreira de Oliveira,Abstract—The demand for quality assessment criteria and associated evaluation methods inacademia is increasing and has been the focus of many studies in the last decade. Thisgrowth arises due to the pursuit of academic excellence and support for the decision makingof funding agencies. The high pressure from such scenario requires quality criteriaobjectively defined. In this paper; we develop an assessment procedure for graduateprograms evaluation based on the internal collaborations among their research groups.These collaborations are evaluated through analysis on co-authorships networks based onnovel metrics of social interaction. Furthermore; our procedure is easily reproduced and maybe customized for evaluating any set of research groups.

Roxsum: Leveraging data aggregation and batch processing for xml routing,Zografoula Vagena; Mirella M Moro; Vassilis J Tsotras,Content-based routing is the primary form of communication within publish/subscribesystems. In those systems data transmission is performed by sophisticated overlay networksof content-based routers; which match data messages against registered subscriptions andforward them based on this matching. Despite their inherent complexities; such systems areexpected to deliver information in a timely and scalable fashion. As a result; their successfuldeployment is a strenuous task. Relevant efforts have so far focused on the construction ofthe overlay network and the filtering of messages at each broker. However; the efficienttransmission of messages has received less attention. In this work; we propose a solutionthat gracefully handles the transmission task; while providing performance benefits for thematching task as well. Along those lines; we design RoXSum; a message representation …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007. IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,28

Extração de conhecimento e análise visual de redes sociais,CMDS Freitas; Luciana P Nedel; Renata Galante; Luís C Lamb; André S Spritzer; Sérgio Fujii; José Palazzo M de Oliveira; Ricardo M Araújo; Mirella M Moro,Abstract. A social network is a graph where people or organizations (depending on theapplication) are represented as nodes connected by edges that can refer to either tightsocial bonds or some common; shared aspect. The graph structure analysis and thestatistical analysis of specific node/edge attributes can reveal important individuals;relationships; and clusters. New information continues to be collected and stored; and sizeand complexity of the semantic graphs overwhelm the human cognitive abilities. Hence; it isnecessary to improve the computational mechanisms to analyze such volume of data. In thispaper; we focus on analyzing the information from social networks; extracting relevantknowledge; and visualizing the facts resultant from the analysis. Resumo.

Schema advisor for hybrid relational-XML DBMS,Mirella M Moro; Lipyeow Lim; Yuan-Chi Chang,Abstract In response to the widespread use of the XML format for document representationand message exchange; major database vendors support XML in terms of persistence;querying and indexing. Specifically; the recently released IBM DB2 9 (for Linux; Unix andWindows) is a hybrid data server with optimized management of both XML and relationaldata. With the new option of storing and querying XML in a relational DBMS; data architectsface the the decision of what portion of their data to persist as XML and what portion asrelational data. This problem has not been addressed yet and represents a serious need inthe industry. Hence; this paper describes ReXSA; a schema advisor tool that is beingprototyped for IBM DB2 9.

Adding time to an object-oriented versions model,Mirella Moura Moro; Silvia Maria Saggiorato; Nina Edelweiss; Clesio Saraiva dos Santos,Abstract In this paper; we propose an object-oriented version model which presentstemporal concepts to store not only the object lifetime but also the history of dynamicattributes and relationships defined in the versioned objects and versions. One of the mainfeatures of our model is the possibility of having two different time orders; branched time forthe object and linear time for each version. The model supports integration with existingdatabases; by allowing the modeling of normal classes among the temporal versionedclasses. Finally; an approach to its implementation on top of a commercial database ispresented.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2001,25

Aggregating productivity indices for ranking researchers across multiple areas,Harlley Lima; Thiago HP Silva; Mirella M Moro; Rodrygo LT Santos; Wagner Meira Jr; Alberto HF Laender,Abstract The impact of scientific research has traditionally been quantified using productivityindices such as the well-known h-index. On the other hand; different research fields---in fact;even different research areas within a single field---may have very different publishingpatterns; which may not be well described by a single; global index. In this paper; we arguethat productivity indices should account for the singularities of the publication patterns ofdifferent research areas; in order to produce an unbiased assessment of the impact ofscientific research. Inspired by ranking aggregation approaches in distributed informationretrieval; we propose a novel approach for ranking researchers across multiple researchareas. Our approach is generic and produces cross-area versions of any global productivityindex; such as the volume of publications; citation count and even the h-index.

XML: some papers in a haystack,Mirella M Moro; Vanessa Braganholo; Carina F Dorneles; Denio Duarte; Renata Galante; Ronaldo S Mello,Abstract XML has been explored by both research and industry communities. More than5500 papers were published on different aspects of XML. With so many publications; it ishard for someone to decide where to start. Hence; this paper presents some of the researchtopics on XML; namely: XML on relational databases; query processing; views; datamatching; and schema evolution. It then summarizes some (some!) of the most relevant ortraditional papers on those subjects.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2009,20
An X-ray on Web-available XML Schemas,Alberto HF Laender; Mirella M Moro; Cristiano Nascimento; Patrícia Martins,Abstract XML has conquered its place as the most used standard for representing Web data.An XML schema may be employed for similar purposes of those from database schemas.There are different languages to write an XML schema; such as DTD and XSD. In this paper;we provide a general view; an X-Ray; on Web-available XSD files by identifying which XSDconstructs are more and less frequently used. Furthermore; we provide an evolutionperspective; showing results from XSD files collected in 2005 and 2008. Hence; we can alsodraw some conclusions on what trends seem to exist in XSD usage. The results of suchstudy provide relevant information for developers of XML applications; tools and algorithmsin which the schema has a distinguished role.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2009,20

Community-based endogamy as an influence indicator,Thiago HP Silva; Mirella M Moro; Ana Paula C Silva; Wagner Meira Jr; Alberto HF Laender,Abstract Evaluating researchers (individually or in groups) usually depends on qualifyingtheir publications and influence. Here; we aid such crucial task by introducing two newmetrics (C-Endo and Comb) that rely on the concept of endogamy for communities ofauthors who publish in conferences and journals; and produce patents. Endogamy heremeasures how tightly structured the groups of authors are within a community. We validateand evaluate the metrics by using real datasets; two ground-truth rankings and citationcount. We also perform random sampling analysis to account for any unbalance from theground-truth rankings. Overall; such a thorough evaluation shows that our metrics aresuccessful in defining community-based endogamy as an influence indicator.,Proceedings of the 14th ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries,2014,16
Analyzing the strength of co-authorship ties with neighborhood overlap,Michele A Brandão; Mirella M Moro,Abstract Evaluating researchers' scientific productivity usually relies on bibliometry only;which may not be always fair. Here; we take a step forward on analyzing such data byexploring the strength of co-authorship ties in social networks. Specifically; we build co-authorship social networks by extracting the datasets of three research areas (sociology;medicine and computer science) from a real digital library and analyze how topologicalproperties relate to the strength of ties. Our results show that different topological propertiesexplain variations in the strength of co-authorship ties; depending on the research area.Also; we show that neighborhood overlap can be applied to scientific productivity evaluationand analysis beyond bibliometry.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2015,15
Supporting branched versions on XML documents,Zografoula Vagena; Mirella Moura Moro; Vassilis J Tsotras,Many e-commerce and e-government applications are collaborative in nature (egnegotiation and e-catalog management). In collaborative environments; users typicallydefine new document versions from any past version; which creates the need for supportingmultiversion XML documents; particularly branched versioning. In this paper; we address theproblem of evaluating path expression queries over XML documents with branchedversions. We extend path joins to work in a branched version environment and to allowqueries on multiple versions. We propose a storage scheme that efficiently maintains allbranched document versions and describe changes required on Pathstack; an optimalpattern matching algorithm. Finally; we investigate the effectiveness of our techniquesthrough experimental evaluation.,Research Issues on Data Engineering: Web Services for e-Commerce and e-Government Applications; 2004.

Semantic search over XML document streams,Zografoula Vagena; Mirella M Moro,ABSTRACT A large number of web data sources; such as blogs; news sites and podcasthosts; are currently disseminating their content in the form of streaming XML documents. Thevariability and heterogeneity of those sources make the employment of traditional queryingschemes; which are based on structured query languages; cumbersome for the end user(those languages require precise knowledge of the underlying schema of each queried datasource in order to be able to formulate meaningful queries). On the other hand; keywordsearch provides an alternative retrieval paradigm that is both simple and effective. Itsimportance for XML retrieval is well established and many specialized XML search engineshave already appeared.

Efficient processing of XML containment queries using partition-based schemes,Zografoula Vagena; Mirella Moura Moro; Vassilis J Tsotras,XML query languages provide facilities to query XML data both on their value as well astheir structure. A basic operation in processing and optimizing such queries is thecontainment join; which takes two sets of elements and returns pairs of elements where oneis the ancestor (or descendant) of the other. Most of the techniques proposed so far assumethat the two sets are already sorted or utilize preexisting indexing schemes. In contrast; apartition-based technique does not require indexing or sorting. Instead; the containment joinis processed by dividing the input sets into smaller partitions. In this paper; we present a newpartition-based scheme that gracefully adapts to different document sizes. The advantagesof our approach are validated through an experimental comparison with previous work.Moreover; the experiments demonstrate that our solution provides a viable alternative to …,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2004.

An Evaluation Study of Search Algorithms for XML Streams,Evandrino G Barros; Mirella M Moro; Alberto HF Laender,Abstract Keyword-based searching services over XML streams are essential for widely usedstreaming applications; such as dissemination services; sensor networks and stock marketquotes. However; XML stream keyword search algorithms are usually schema dependentand do not allow pure keyword queries. Furthermore; ranking methods are still relativelyunexploited in such algorithms. This paper presents an accuracy and performance study oftwo keyword-based search algorithms for XML streams. Our study provides a comparison ofthese two algorithms by using an XPath benchmark as source of data and queries.Moreover; we also consider a large collection of XML documents and a large set of randomqueries; both based on DBLP dataset. Finally; we propose a strategy that combines bothalgorithms and ranks the keyword-based search results.,Journal of Information and Data Management,2010,8

Dynamic systems specifications using versions and time,Mirella Moura Moro; Silvia Maria Saggiorato; Nina Edelweiss; C Saraiva dos Santos,A temporal data model can be used to specify not only static but also dynamic aspects of anapplication; allowing us to record the evolution of its objects. Conventional applicationscommonly use the concept of transaction to update information; while unconventionalapplications require managing many database states to keep the update history. To fulfil thisrequest; the concept of version is presented. The main purpose of the work is to present analternative for the union of temporal data and a version model. The result; the TemporalVersions Model; is able to store the object versions and for each version; the history of itsdynamic properties and relationship values. One of the most interesting features of ourmodel is the possibility of having two different time orders; branched time for the object andlinear time for each version.

Value-Aware RoXSum: Effective Message Aggregation for XML-Aware Information Dissemination.,Zografoula Vagena; Mirella Moura Moro; Vassilis J Tsotras,ABSTRACT Publish/subscribe (or pub/sub) systems perform asynchronous messagetransmission; from publishers to subscribers; without any of the parties having knowledge ofthe other. The pub/sub infrastructure manages the delivery of the messages; which is guidedby user subscriptions that specify the type of information the subscribers are interested in.Since XML prevails as the standard for information exchange; efficient XML-aware pub/subsystems become necessary. Within that context; we propose VA-RoXSum; a novel messagerepresentation scheme that aggregates the content of messages in a space efficient manner.Coupled with specialized processing algorithms that operate on its aggregated content; theVA-RoXSum enables the batch processing of groups of messages and considerablyimproves the performance of the subscription-guided filtering task.

The strength of co-authorship ties through different topological properties,Michele A Brandão; Mirella M Moro,Abstract Social networks are complex structures that describe individuals (graph nodes)connected in any social context (graph edges). Different metrics can be applied to thosenetworks and their properties in order to understand behavior and even predict the future.One of such properties is tie strength; which allows to identify prominent individuals; analyzehow relationships play different roles; predict links; and so on. Here; we specifically addressthe problem of measuring tie strength in co-authorship social networks (nodes areresearchers and edges represent their co-authored publications). We start by presentingfour cases that emphasize the problems of current metrics. Then; we propose a new metricfor tie strength; called tieness; that is simple to calculate and better differentiates the degreesof strength.

Scientific Collaboration in Research Networks: A Quantification Method by Using Gini Coefficient.,Giseli Rabello Lopes; Roberto Da Silva; Mirella M Moro; José Palazzo Moreira de Oliveira,In the scientific community; it is very common to try to create sound metrics for practicallyeverything that can be measured. One of the current trends is to consider aspects from socialnetworks for defining evaluation metrics. Following such a trend; our work proposesapplying the Gini coefficient for evaluating research networks from two differentperspectives. The first one analyzes the temporal evolution of research networks byconsidering the Gini coefficient of the distribution of researchers who have co-authoredpublications. The second one compares different internal collaboration networks of graduateprograms and applies the Gini coefficient to support the ranking creation task. Both ideas aredemonstrated through experiments that show the validity and applicability of our approachfor quantifying scientific collaborations. Moreover; we also propose a new index that …,IJCSA,2012,6

Automatically generating structured queries in XML keyword search,Felipe da C Hummel; Altigran S Da Silva; Mirella M Moro; Alberto HF Laender,Abstract In this paper; we present a novel method for automatically deriving structured XMLqueries from keyword-based queries and show how it was applied to the experimental tasksproposed for the INEX 2010 data-centric track. In our method; called StruX; users specify aschema-independent unstructured keyword-based query and it automatically generates atop-k ranking of schema-aware queries based on a target XML database. Then; one of thetop ranked structured queries can be selected; automatically or by a user; to be executed byan XML query engine. The generated structured queries are XPath expressions consistingof an entity path (eg; dblp/article) and predicates (eg;/dblp/article [author=” john” and title=”xml”]). We use the concept of entity; commonly adopted in the XML keyword searchliterature; to define suitable root nodes for the query results. Also; StruX uses IR …,International Workshop of the Initiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval,2010,6
The role of structural aggregation for query processing over XML data,Mirella Moura Moro,Abstract With the advent of XML as the basis for many data-centric applications; issuesregarding the effective retrieval of XML data have become prevalent. In this context; XMLquery evaluation presents unique challenges mainly because existing relational queryalgorithms cannot be directly applied to process XML data for diverse reasons: XML dataconform to a tree-format rather than a tabular one; do not follow a strict schema; and aretypically textual with repetitive information. A number of data structures—known as structuralsummaries—have been defined to compensate for the XML data repetition and lack ofschema. So far; these summaries have been explored mainly as secondary indexes that canidentify nodes reachable from specific path patterns. This dissertation shows that suchsummaries can also indicate new data clustering and partitioning policies that are very …,*,2007,6
Type-safe versioned object query language,Rodrigo Machado; Alvaro Freitas Moreira; Renata de Matos Galante,Abstract: The concept of versioning was initially proposed for controlling design evolution oncomputer aided design and software engineering. On the context of database systems;versioning is applied for managing the evolution of different elements of the data. Moderndatabase systems provide not only powerful data models but also complex query languagesthat have evolved to include several features from complex programming languages. Whilemost related work focuses on different aspects of the concepts; designing models; andprocessing of versions efficiently; there is yet to be a formal definition of a query language fordatabase systems with versions control. In this work we propose a query language; namedVersioned Object Query Language (VOQL); that extends ODMG Object Query Language(OQL) with new features to recover object versions. We provide a precise definition of …,Simposio Brasileiro de Linguagens de Programacao (10.: 2006 maio: Rio de Janeiro). Anais.[S. l.]: IME/UFMG; 2006.,2006,6
Temporal versions model,Mirella Moura Moro; Nina Edelweiss; Clesio Saraiva dos Santos,Abstract This work presents an alternative for the union of temporal data and a versionmodel. The result; the Temporal Versions Model; is able to store object versions and; foreach version; the history of its dynamic properties values. TVM is ideal for modeling time-evolving systems that need to manage design alternatives as versions. One of the mainfeatures of our model is the possibility of having two different time orders; branched time forthe object and linear time for each version. The model supports integration with existingdatabases; by allowing normal classes among the temporal versioned classes. Finally; anapproach to its implementation on top of a commercial database within an integratedenvironment is presented.,XV Workshop de Teses e Dissertações-CTD,2002,6

3c-index: Research contribution across communities as an influence indicator,Thiago HP Silva; Lais MA Rocha; Ana Paula C Silva; Mirella M Moro,Abstract This paper proposes a new influence metric (called 3c-index) derived frombibliographic data and social networks analysis. Given a set of communities defined bypublication venues; the goal is to measure the degree of influence of researchers byevaluating the links they establish between communities. Specifically; each researcher hasa base community where he/she presents greater influence. Then; when such researcherworks on a different community (besides the base community); he/she takes new knowledgeto that community and transfers influence; which improves the global quality of thecommunities. By pondering such transfer; we measure the influence of researchers in theirand across communities. We also experimentally evaluate the performance of the new indexagainst well known metrics (volume of publications; number of citations and h-index).

Generating XML/GML Schemas from Geographic Conceptual Schemas.,André C Hora; Clodoveu A Davis Jr; Mirella M Moro,Abstract. A large volume of data with complex structures is currently represented in GML(Geography Markup Language) for storing and exchanging geographic information. As thesize and complexity of such documents and their schemas grow; techniques and rules fordesigning and creating such documents become indispensable. This paper introduces amethod for mapping geographic conceptual specifications (defined in OMT-G) to GMLSchema. Our method avoids semantic or structural losses and provides redundancy-freedata. It also reduces the use of integrity constraints and improves the nesting of XMLelements in the resulting schema. We have implemented the method in order to automatethe process of obtaining the target schema from the original geographic model.Experimental results show that spatial and non-spatial queries over the GML documents …,AMW,2010,5

Using topological properties to measure the strength of co-authorship ties,Michele A Brandao; Matheus A Diniz; Mirella M Moro,Abstract. Studying the strength of ties in social networks allows to identify impact at micro-macro levels in the network; to analyze how distinct relationships play different roles; and soon. Indeed; the strength of ties has been investigated in many contexts with different goals.Here; we aim to address the problem of measuring ties strength in co-authorship socialnetworks. Specifically; we present four case studies detailing problems with current metricsand propose a new one. Then; we build a co-authorship social network by using a realdigital library and identify how the strength of ties relates to the quality of publication venueswhen measured by different topological properties. Our results show the best ranked venueshave similar patterns of strength of co-authorship ties.,*,2016,4

Tie strength persistence and transformation,Michele A Brandão; POS Vaz de Melo; Mirella M Moro,Abstract In temporal co-authorship social networks; nodes are authors linked by co-authorship interactions. As time is a relevant aspect of such interactions; concepts andmetrics designed to static networks have to be adapted to temporal networks. Tie strength isone of those concepts. Here; we verify if current tie strength definition is valid for temporalnetworks by analyzing the strength of ties dynamism over temporal co-authorship networks.Surprisingly; our results show that most ties; even the strong ones; tend to perish over time.Also; real co-authorship social networks from different research areas have more weak andrandom ties than strong and bridge ties.,AMW (to appear),2017,3

VRRC: web based tool for visualization and recommendation on co-authorship network,Eduardo M Barbosa; Mirella M Moro; Giseli Rabello Lopes; J Palazzo M de Oliveira,Abstract Scientific studies are usually developed by contributions from different researchers.Analyzing such collaborations is often necessary; for example; when evaluating the qualityof a research group. Also; identifying new partnership possibilities within a set ofresearchers is frequently desired; for example; when looking for partners in foreigncountries. Both analysis and identification are not easy tasks; and are usually donemanually. This work presents VRRC; a new approach for visualizing recommendations ofpeople within a co-authorship network (ie; a graph in which nodes represent researchersand edges represent their co-authorships).

In this article; we propose two new algorithms (calledSLCAStream and ELCAStream) for processing multiple keyword queries over XML streams.Both algorithms process keyword-based queries that require minimal or no schemaknowledge to be formulated; follow the lowest common ancestor (LCA) semantics; andprovide optimized methods to improve the overall performance. Moreover; SLCAStream;which implements the smallest LCA (SLCA) semantics; outperforms the state-of-the-art; withup to 49% reduction in response time and 36% in memory usage. In turn; ELCAStream is thefirst to explore the exclusive LCA (ELCA) semantics over XML streams. A comprehensive …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2016,1
Pick the right team and make a blockbuster: a social analysis through movie history,Wladston Viana; Ana Paula Couto da Silva; Mirella M Moro,Abstract We explore the relation between team performance and its topological networkcharacteristics by creating a social network of movie producers and extracting topologicalfeatures from each team. Then; we employ machine learning techniques to build a moviesuccess predictor based on the extracted features. Results show topological features havepredictive power over movie's success and can also be included in other non-topologicalmodels to improve accuracy.,Proceedings of the 31st Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2016,1

Processing XPath Structural Constraints on GPU,Dilson A Guimarães; Filipe de L Arcanjo; Laura R Antuña; Mirella M Moro; Renato C Ferreira,Abstract Technologies such as CUDA and OpenCL have popularized the usage of graphicscards (GPUs) for general purpose programming; often with impressive performance gains.However; using such cards for speeding up XML Databases processing is yet to be fullyexplored. XML databases offer much flexibility for Web-oriented systems. Nonetheless; suchflexibility comes at a considerable computational cost. This work shows how graphics cardscan be leveraged to reduce the computational cost of processing an important subset ofXPath queries. It presents an algorithm designed to consider the cost model of GPUs and toevaluate queries efficiently. An experimental study reveals that this algorithm is moreefficient than implementations of a similar strategy on CPU for all the datasets tested.

Busca de caminhos entre usuários de redes sociais em tempo real,Wladston Viana; Mirella M Moro,Abstract. The average distance between users in a social network is small; given the sixdegree theory. Nonetheless; most online social networks do not offer any way fordiscovering paths between its users. Tradicional algorithms can be used to find static pathsin offline copies of their graphs. However; in the online scenario; the ideal is to find suchpaths using live data; which is a hard task given the access constraints imposed by thesocial networks. In this work; we introduce a novel; real time path finding algorithm for socialnetworks; called CUTE. It employs a heuristic that considers the geographical distancebetween users. In our experimental evaluation over Twitter; CUTE finds short paths for alltypes of users; while expanding less than 40 nodes. Resumo.

Hash-based Indexing,Mirella M Moro; Donghui Zhang; Vassilis J Tsotras,A hash function is a well-defined deterministic algorithm that takes as input data of arbitrarylength and produces a short fixed-length digital representation of the data; or a digest; as itsoutput. The output of a hash function can serve the role of a digital ''fingerprint''of the inputdata; as an important design property of hash functions is that of collision resilience: twohashes produced on different inputs are very unlikely to result in the same value.Furthermore; given a hash function output; it is normally infeasible to find a (previouslyunseen) input that matches that output (this property is called preimage resistance).,*,2009,1

Before starting a graduate program; it is important torealize that this is a long-term investment in career. Once the students are in graduateschool; it is necessary to structure their personal life to fit the demands of the program. Agraduate program starts by the choice of the advisor during the first year. Sometimes this isdone even before the student is accepted into the program. During the program; interactionwith the colleagues and professors is necessary. Getting to know them is essential to theprogram and to the life. Reading may not be enough.

Tie strength dynamics over temporal co-authorship social networks,Michele A Brandão; Pedro OS de Melo; Mirella M Moro,Abstract In co-authorship social networks; nodes are authors linked by co-authorshipinteractions. As time is a relevant aspect of such interactions; concepts and metrics designedto static networks have to be adapted to temporal networks. Tie strength is one of thoseconcepts. Here; we verify if current tie strength definitions are valid for temporal networks byanalyzing the strength of ties dynamism over temporal co-authorship networks. Surprisingly;our results show that most ties; even the strong ones; tend to perish over time. Thus; most co-authorships are symbiotic without positive concerns. Also; real co-authorship socialnetworks from different research areas have more weak and random ties than strong andbridge ties.,Proceedings of the International Conference on Web Intelligence,2017,*

TRIple Content-based OnTology (TRICOt) for XML Dissemination.,Mirella Moura Moro; Deise de Brum Saccol; Renata de Matos Galante; Depto Ciência da Computaçao,Abstract As Internet and distributed systems evolve; content dissemination systems becomea hot topic for researchers in those areas. In such systems; users define profiles (queries)that must be evaluated over incoming messages (documents); usually on streams. Given thehigh number of profiles and the considerable flow of incoming messages on such systems;research problems reach new levels of complexity on databases and software engineeringperspectives as well. For example; those features make distributed query evaluation evenmore complex. In this context; we propose to expand the use of ontologies to this newcontext of stream processing. Our initial evaluation shows that such solution is viable andopens new possibilities for using the whole potential of ontologies in a very diverse set ofapplications.,SEKE,2009,*

Dense Index,Mirella M Moro; Vassilis J Tsotras,realized using such logical structures. For example; in tree based data acquisition protocols;a collection tree is built that is rooted at the data collection center such as the sink node [8].The dissemination of the data requests from the participating nodes and collection of datafrom the sensor nodes are accomplished using this tree. A cluster based data acquisitionmechanism has been proposed in [3]. As shown in Fig. 1; nodes are organized into a fixednumber of clusters; and nodes within each cluster dynamically elect a cluster head. The dataacquisition is carried out in two phases. In the first phase; cluster heads collect data fromtheir cluster nodes. In the second phase; cluster heads send collected data to the nodes thathave subscribed to the data. The cluster heads are re-elected to balance energyconsumption among the nodes in the cluster. Zhang et al.[13] have proposed an adaptive …,*,2009,*
Sparse Index,Mirella M Moro; Vassilis J Tsotras,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}. A query Q is called domain independent if the value of Qwhen applied to any database is the same for any two domains containing the databasevalues or; equivalently; if the value of Q when applied to a database contains only values …,*,2009,*

The versatility of structural summaries has been established with their extensive usagefor diverse retrieval tasks. Within traditional XML query processing those structures havebeen used as primary indexes on the structure; as well as for (a) structure discovery;(b)query formulation; rewrite and optimization;(c) storage of statistics; and other importantmetadata information. At the same time; structural summaries have appeared within otherXML retrieval scenarios including (a) XML keyword search;(b) information discovery withinP2P systems; and (c) message routing within publish/subscribe systems.

A Query Language for a Versioned Object Oriented Database.,Rodrigo Machado; Alvaro Freitas Moreira; Renata de Matos Galante; Mirella Moura Moro,Abstract. Many applications require that all data updates be stored on and retrieved from adatabase. Such requirement is supported on object oriented databases through versioning.While most related work focuses on different aspects of versions concepts; design modelingand efficient processing of versions; there is yet to be a precise definition of a querylanguage for database systems with versions control. Therefore; we define a querylanguage (called VOQL; Versioned Object Query Language) for an object oriented databasewith versioning support. VOQL extends ODMG and OQL for managing the evolution ofdifferent elements of the data. Besides the language main features; we provide the base of aformal definition for VOQL. Finally; we validate the proposed definition by implementing aninterpreter for the language.,SBBD,2006,*

Mapeamento de consultas do modelo TF-ORM para consultas SQL,Mirella Moura Moro; Nina Edelweiss,Nina Edelweiss (Departamento de Informática Aplicada; Instituto de Informática; UFRGS). OTF-ORM (Temporal Functionality in Objects with Roles Model) é um modelo de dadostemporal orientado a objetos que utiliza o conceito de papéis para representar os diferentescomportamentos dos mesmos. Como não existe um SGBD para o TF-ORM; optou-se porfazer o mapeamento do modelo para um BD relacional comercial. Tendo-se essemapeamento pronto; o próximo passo é permitir que o usuário faça consultas TF-ORMsobre o BD. Assim como o modelo; a consulta também deve ser traduzida para umalinguagem que permita sua execução sobre um BD relacional. A linguagem escolhida foi oSQL (Strutuctured Query Language) por ser uma linguagem muito conhecida e aceita pelamaioria dos BDs relacionais.

Análise do Impacto do Gerador de Conjuntos de Dados em Experimentos de Deduplicaç ao de Dados,Levy de Souza Silva; Mirella M Moro,Abstract. Using tools to create synthetic datasets is the only solution for evaluating dataduplication algorithms when real datasets are not available. However; the evaluation resultsmay be affected by the diversity and levels of parameters available in such tools. Our goal isto verify which parameters and levels impact more on the results of deduplicationexperiments. Hence; we perform factorial projects on datasets created with the most usedtool. Results show that two parameters explain the largest variation of results. Resumo.

Bioinformatics workflows generate massive amounts of data and an efficientmanagement of the data and its provenance is a challenge. The use of the provenance ofdata has brought remarkable benefits to the research in Bioinformatics; allowing a greateraccuracy in the analyses due to the reproducibility and the refinement that it provides to theexperiments. Bioinformatics workflows demand scalability and performance. In such context;the use of non-relational database system (NoSQL) is becoming increasingly common. Thispaper presents a comparative study between the NoSQL databases Cassandra; MongoDBand OrientDB DBMS regarding the management of data and provenance; both collected inthe execution of a DNA assembly workflow.

STACY: Um Novo Algoritmo para Automaticamente Classificar a Força dos Relacionamentos ao Longo dos Anos,Michele A Brandão; Pedro OS Vaz de Melo; Mirella M Moro,Abstract. Understanding the relationships between people in a social network andmeasuring their strength over time are interesting problems with distinct applications. Here;we propose a new algorithm (STACY) to automatically classify tie strength in eight differentclasses by considering the temporal aspect. Our results show: such classes representdifferent behaviors; and STACY identifies strong relationships that persist more than theones classified by a state of the art algorithm. Resumo.

Busca de Caminhos em Redes Sociais Geolocalizadas em Tempo Real,Wladston Viana; Mirella M Moro; Fabrıcio Benevenuto,Abstract. This paper tackles the problem of finding a path between two users in a socialnetwork. Classical solutions involve searching for paths in an entire snapshot of the socialgraph; which is impractical for large scale social networks (such as Twitter and Facebook)because they do not provide broad and unrestricted access to their social graph. Here; wepropose a novel real time path finding algorithm for social networks; called CUTE; and anonline tool that uses it; called FriendRouter. In our experimental evaluation over Twitter; thealgorithm finds short paths for a number of users by expanding the friend list of no more than40 users. Resumo.

TripTag: Ferramenta de planejamento de viagens baseada em experiências de usuários de redes sociais,Antônio HG Leite; Fabrıcio Benevenuto; Mirella M Moro,Abstract. The new Internet-connected generations of tourists search for destinations andplan their trips through online services. A new way of doing so is through “travel socialnetworks”; in which regular people share their opinion about touristic places. In suchnetworks; the information is always updated and not biased according to agencies interests.However; there are two major problems: searching for a place in such networks the user toknow where she or he wants to go; and acquiring knowledge about it requires reading itsreviews; which vary from a handful to hundreds of texts. In this paper; we describe a new;exciting tool that automatically crawls different travel social networks; aggregates theircontent; tags them; allows to search for such tags; performs sentiment analysis andsummarizes the reviews through word clouds.
