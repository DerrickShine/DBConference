Top-down specialization for information and privacy preservation,Benjamin CM Fung; Ke Wang; Philip S Yu,Releasing person-specific data in its most specific state poses a threat to individual privacy.This paper presents a practical and efficient algorithm for determining a generalized versionof data that masks sensitive information and remains useful for modelling classification. Thegeneralization of data is implemented by specializing or detailing the level of information ina top-down manner until a minimum privacy requirement is violated. This top-downspecialization is natural and efficient for handling both categorical and continuous attributes.Our approach exploits the fact that data usually contains redundant structures forclassification. While generalization may eliminate some structures; other structures emergeto help. Our results show that quality of classification can be preserved even for highlyrestrictive privacy requirements. This work has great applicability to both public and …,Data Engineering; 2005. ICDE 2005. Proceedings. 21st International Conference on,2005,626
Hierarchical document clustering using frequent itemsets,Benjamin CM Fung; Ke Wang; Martin Ester,Abstract A major challenge in document clustering is the extremely high dimensionality. Forexample; the vocabulary for a document set can easily be thousands of words. On the otherhand; each document often contains a small fraction of words in the vocabulary. Thesefeatures require special handlings. Another requirement is hierarchical clustering whereclustered documents can be browsed according to the increasing specificity of topics. In thispaper; we propose to use the notion of frequent itemsets; which comes from association rulemining; for document clustering. The intuition of our clustering criterion is that each cluster isidentified by some common words; called frequent itemsets; for the documents in the cluster.Frequent itemsets are also used to produce a hierarchical topic tree for clusters. By focusingon frequent items; the dimensionality of the document set is drastically reduced. We show …,*,2003,604
PSORT-B: Improving protein subcellular localization prediction for Gram-negative bacteria,Jennifer L Gardy; Cory Spencer; Ke Wang; Martin Ester; Gabor E Tusnady; István Simon; Sujun Hua; Katalin deFays; Christophe Lambert; Kenta Nakai; Fiona SL Brinkman,Abstract Automated prediction of bacterial protein subcellular localization is an importanttool for genome annotation and drug discovery. PSORT has been one of the most widelyused computational methods for such bacterial protein analysis; however; it has not beenupdated since it was introduced in 1991. In addition; neither PSORT nor any of the othercomputational methods available make predictions for all five of the localization sitescharacteristic of Gram-negative bacteria. Here we present PSORT-B; an updated version ofPSORT for Gram-negative bacteria; which is available as a web-based application athttp://www. psort. org. PSORT-B examines a given protein sequence for amino acidcomposition; similarity to proteins of known localization; presence of a signal peptide;transmembrane alpha-helices and motifs corresponding to specific localizations.

(α; k)-anonymity: an enhanced k-anonymity model for privacy preserving data publishing,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Jiuyong Li; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang,Abstract Privacy preservation is an important issue in the release of data for miningpurposes. The k-anonymity model has been introduced for protecting individualidentification. Recent studies show that a more sophisticated model is necessary to protectthe association of individuals to sensitive information. In this paper; we propose an (α; k)-anonymity model to protect both identifications and relationships to sensitive information indata. We discuss the properties of (α; k)-anonymity model. We prove that the optimal (α; k)-anonymity problem is NP-hard. We first presentan optimal global-recoding method for the (α;k)-anonymity problem. Next we propose a local-recoding algorithm which is more scalableand result in less data distortion. The effectiveness and efficiency are shown by experiments.We also describe how the model can be extended to more general case.,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,355
Anonymizing classification data for privacy preservation,Benjamin CM Fung; Ke Wang; S Yu Philip,Classification is a fundamental problem in data analysis. Training a classifier requiresaccessing a large collection of data. Releasing person-specific data; such as customer dataor patient records; may pose a threat to an individual's privacy. Even after removing explicitidentifying information such as Name and SSN; it is still possible to link released recordsback to their identities by matching some combination of nonidentifying attributes such as{Sex; Zip; Birthdate}. A useful approach to combat such linking attacks; called k-anonymization; is anonymizing the linking attributes so that at least k released recordsmatch each value combination of the linking attributes. Previous work attempted to find anoptimal k-anonymization that minimizes some data distortion metric. We argue thatminimizing the distortion to the training data is not relevant to the classification goal that …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2007,339
Bottom-up generalization: A data mining solution to privacy protection,Ke Wang; Philip S Yu; Sourav Chakraborty,The well-known privacy-preserved data mining modifies existing data mining techniques torandomized data. In this paper; we investigate data mining as a technique for masking data;therefore; termed data mining based privacy protection. This approach incorporates partiallythe requirement of a targeted data mining task into the process of masking data so thatessential structure is preserved in the masked data. The idea is simple but novel: we explorethe data generalization concept from data mining as a way to hide detailed information;rather than discover trends and patterns. Once the data is masked; standard data miningtechniques can be applied without modification. Our work demonstrated another positiveuse of data mining technology: not only can it discover useful patterns; but also mask privateinformation. We consider the following privacy problem: a data holder wants to release a …,Data Mining; 2004. ICDM'04. Fourth IEEE International Conference on,2004,325
Multi-dimensional sequential pattern mining,Helen Pinto; Jiawei Han; Jian Pei; Ke Wang; Qiming Chen; Umeshwar Dayal,Abstract Sequential pattern mining; which finds the set of frequent subsequences insequence databases; is an important data-mining task and has broad applications. Usually;sequence patterns are associated with different circumstances; and such circumstancesform a multiple dimensional space. For example; customer purchase sequences areassociated with region; time; customer group; and others. It is interesting and useful to minesequential patterns associated with multi-dimensional information. In this paper; we proposethe theme of multi-dimensional sequential pattern mining; which integrates themultidimensional analysis and sequential data mining. We also thoroughly explore efficientmethods for multi-dimensional sequential pattern mining. We examine feasiblecombinations of efficient sequential pattern mining and multi-dimensional analysis …,Proceedings of the tenth international conference on Information and knowledge management,2001,317
Minimality attack in privacy preserving data publishing,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang; Jian Pei,Abstract Data publishing generates much concern over the protection of individual privacy.Recent studies consider cases where the adversary may possess different kinds ofknowledge about the data. In this paper; we show that knowledge of the mechanism oralgorithm of anonymization for data publication can also lead to extra information that assiststhe adversary and jeopardizes individual privacy. In particular; all known mechanisms try tominimize information loss and such an attempt provides a loophole for attacks. We call suchan attack a minimality attack. In this paper; we introduce a model called m-confidentialitywhich deals with minimality attacks; and propose a feasible solution. Our experiments showthat minimality attacks are practical concerns on real datasets and that our algorithm canprevent such attacks with very little overhead and information loss.,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,279
Efficient computation of iceberg cubes with complex measures,Jiawei Han; Jian Pei; Guozhu Dong; Ke Wang,Abstract It is often too expensive to compute and materialize a complete high-dimensionaldata cube. Computing an iceberg cube; which contains only aggregates above certainthresholds; is an effective way to derive nontrivial multi-dimensional aggregations for OLAPand data mining. In this paper; we study efficient methods for computing iceberg cubes withsome popularly used complex measures; such as average; and develop a methodology thatadopts a weaker but anti-monotonic condition for testing and pruning search space. Inparticular; for efficient computation of iceberg cubes with the average measure; we proposea top-k average pruning method and extend two previously studied methods; Apriori andBUC; to Top-k Apriori and Top-k BUC. To further improve the performance; an interestinghypertree structure; called H-tree; is designed and a new iceberg cubing method; called …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2001,278
Mining frequent item sets by opportunistic projection,Junqiang Liu; Yunhe Pan; Ke Wang; Jiawei Han,Abstract In this paper; we present a novel algorithm Opportune Project for mining completeset of frequent item sets by projecting databases to grow a frequent item set tree. Ouralgorithm is fundamentally different from those proposed in the past in that itopportunistically chooses between two different structures; array-based or tree-based; torepresent projected transaction subsets; and heuristically decides to build unfiltered pseudoprojection or to make a filtered copy according to features of the subsets. More importantly;we propose novel methods to build tree-based pseudo projections and array-basedunfiltered projections for projected transaction subsets; which makes our algorithm bothCPU time efficient and memory saving. Basically; the algorithm grows the frequent item settree by depth first search; whereas breadth first search is used to build the upper portion …,Proceedings of the eighth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2002,270
Privacy-enhancing personalized web search,Yabo Xu; Ke Wang; Benyu Zhang; Zheng Chen,Abstract Personalized web search is a promising way to improve search quality bycustomizing search results for people with individual information goals. However; users areuncomfortable with exposing private preference information to search engines. On the otherhand; privacy is not absolute; and often can be compromised if there is a gain in service orprofitability to the user. Thus; a balance must be struck between search quality and privacyprotection. This paper presents a scalable way for users to automatically build rich userprofiles. These profiles summarize a user. s interests into a hierarchical organizationaccording to specific interests. Two parameters for specifying privacy requirements areproposed to help the user to choose the content and degree of detail of the profileinformation that is exposed to the search engine. Experiments showed that the user …,Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web,2007,259
Clustering transactions using large items,Ke Wang; Chu Xu; Bing Liu,Abstract In traditional data clustering; similarity of a cluster of objects is measured bypairwise similarity of objects in that cluster. We argue that such measures are notappropriate for transactions that are sets of items. We propose the notion of large items; ie;items contained in some minimum fraction of transactions in a cluster; to measure thesimilarity of a cluster of transactions. The intuition of our clustering criterion is that thereshould be many large items within a cluster and little overlapping of such items acrossclusters. We discuss the rationale behind our approach and its implication on providing abetter solution to the clustering problem. We present a clustering algorithm based on thenew clustering criterion and evaluate its effectiveness.,Proceedings of the eighth international conference on Information and knowledge management,1999,247
Anonymizing sequential releases,Ke Wang; Benjamin Fung,Abstract An organization makes a new release as new information become available;releases a tailored view for each data request; releases sensitive information and identifyinginformation separately. The availability of related releases sharpens the identification ofindividuals by a global quasi-identifier consisting of attributes from related releases. Since itis not an option to anonymize previously released data; the current release must beanonymized to ensure that a global quasi-identifier is not effective for identification. In thispaper; we study the sequential anonymization problem under this assumption. A keyquestion is how to anonymize the current release so that it cannot be linked to previousreleases yet remains useful for its own release purpose. We introduce the lossy join; anegative property in relational database design; as a way to hide the join relationship …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,227
Discovering structural association of semistructured data,Ke Wang; Huiqing Liu,Many semistructured objects are similarly; though not identically structured. We study theproblem of discovering" typical" substructures of a collection of semistructured objects. Thediscovered structures can serve the following purposes: 1) the" table-of-contents" for gaininggeneral information of a source; 2) a road map for browsing and querying informationsources; 3) a basis for clustering documents; 4) partial schemas for providing standarddatabase access methods; and 5) user/customer interests and browsing patterns. Thediscovery task is affected by structural features of semistructured data in a nontrivial way andtraditional data mining frameworks are inapplicable. We define this discovery problem andpropose a solution.,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2000,202
Anonymizing transaction databases for publication,Yabo Xu; Ke Wang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Philip S Yu,Abstract This paper considers the problem of publishing" transaction data" for researchpurposes. Each transaction is an arbitrary set of items chosen from a large universe.Detailed transaction data provides an electronic image of one's life. This has twoimplications. One; transaction data are excellent candidates for data mining research. Two;use of transaction data would raise serious concerns over individual privacy. Therefore;before transaction data is released for data mining; it must be made anonymous so that datasubjects cannot be re-identified. The challenge is that transaction data has no structure andcan be extremely high dimensional. Traditional anonymization methods lose too muchinformation on such data. To date; there has been no satisfactory privacy notion and solutionproposed for anonymizing transaction data. This paper proposes one way to address this …,Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2008,189
Discovering typical structures of documents: a road map approach,Ke Wang; Huiqing Liu,Abstract The structure of a document refers to the role and hierarchy of subdocumentreferences. Many online documents are similarly structured; though not identicallystructured. We study the problem of discovering “typical” structures of a collection of suchdocuments; where the user specifies the minimum frequency of a typical structure. We willconsider structural features of subdocument references such as labeling; nesting; ordering;cyclicity; and wild-card references; like those found on the Web and digital libraries. Typicalstructures can be used to serve the following purposes.(a) The “table-ofcontent” for gainingthe general information of a source.(b) A road map for browsing and querying a source.(c) Abasis for clustering documents.(d) Partial schemas for building structured layers to providestandard database access methods.(e) User/customer's interests and browsing patterns …,Proceedings of the 21st annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,1998,189
Mining frequent itemsets using support constraints,Ke Wang; Yu He; Jiawei Han,Abstract Interesting patterns often occur at varied levels of support. The classic associationmining based on a uniform minimum support; such as Apriori; either misses interestingpatterns of low support or suffers from the bottleneck of itemset generation. A better solutionis to exploit support constraints; which specify what minimum support is required for whatitemsets; so that only necessary itemsets are generated. In this paper; we present aframework of frequent itemset mining in the presence of support constraints. Our approach isto" push" support constraints into the Apriori itemset generation so that the" best" minimumsupport is used for each itemset at run time to preserve the essence of Apriori.,VLDB,2000,183
Rectree: An efficient collaborative filtering method,Sonny Han Seng Chee; Jiawei Han; Ke Wang,Abstract Many people rely on the recommendations of trusted friends to find restaurants ormovies; which match their tastes. But; what if your friends have not sampled the item ofinterest? Collaborative filtering (CF) seeks to increase the effectiveness of this process byautomating the derivation of a recommendation; often from a clique of advisors that we haveno prior personal relationship with. CF is a promising tool for dealing with the informationoverload that we face in the networked world. Prior works in CF have dealt with improvingthe accuracy of the predictions. However; it is still challenging to scale these methods tolarge databases. In this study; we develop an efficient collaborative filtering method; calledRecTree (which stands for RECommendation Tree) that addresses the scalability problemwith a divide-and-conquer approach. The method first performs an efficient k-means-like …,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2001,179
Growing decision trees on support-less association rules,Ke Wang; Senqiang Zhou; Yu He,1. INTRODUCTION In association mining; first studied in database [1]; the task is to find allassociation rules that are individually predictive in terms of high confidence. Associationrules; first motivated by market-basket analysis; capture co-occurrence of events; such ascoffee and sugar are often sold together. In classification mining; mainly studied in machinelearning; statistic; pattern recognition; information retrieval (See [5; 14]; for example); the taskis to find a classifier; usually a set of rules; that are collectively qualified in terms ofassociating new cases with classes. The two problems have been largely investigatedindependently; despite their similarity ofdiscovering association of some kind. Interestingquestions arise: what issues must be addressed to turn association rules into a classifier?how does this approach compare to traditional classification methods? In this paper; we …,Proceedings of the sixth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2000,179
Top down fp-growth for association rule mining,Ke Wang; Liu Tang; Jiawei Han; Junqiang Liu,Abstract In this paper; we propose an efficient algorithm; called TD-FP-Growth (theshorthand for Top-Down FP-Growth); to mine frequent patterns. TD-FP-Growth searches theFP-tree in the top-down order; as opposed to the bottom-up order of previously proposed FP-Growth. The advantage of the top-down search is not generating conditional pattern basesand sub-FP-trees; thus; saving substantial amount of time and space. We extend TD-FP-Growth to mine association rules by applying two new pruning strategies: one is to pushmultiple minimum supports and the other is to push the minimum confidence. Experimentsshow that these algorithms and strategies are highly effective in reducing the search space.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2002,171
Building hierarchical classifiers using class proximity,Ke Wang; Senqiang Zhou; Shiang Chen Liew,Abstract In this paper; we address the need to automatically classify text documents intotopic hierarchies like those in ACM Digital Library and Yahoo!. The existing local approachconstructs a classifier at each split of the topic hierarchy. However; the local approach doesnot address the closeness of classification in hierarchical classification where the concernoften is how close a classification is; rather than simply correct or wrong. Also; the localapproach puts its bet on classification at higher levels where the classification structure oftendiminishes. To address these issues; we propose the notion of class proximity and cast thehierarchical classification as a flat classification with the class proximity modeling thecloseness of classes. Our approach is global in that it constructs a single classifier based onthe global information about all classes and class proximity. We leverage generalized …,VLDB,1999,169
Handicapping attacker's confidence: an alternative to k-anonymization,Ke Wang; Benjamin CM Fung; S Yu Philip,Abstract We present an approach of limiting the confidence of inferring sensitive propertiesto protect against the threats caused by data mining abilities. The problem has dual goals:preserve the information for a wanted data analysis request and limit the usefulness ofunwanted sensitive inferences that may be derived from the release of data. Sensitiveinferences are specified by a set of “privacy templates". Each template specifies the sensitiveproperty to be protected; the attributes identifying a group of individuals; and a maximumthreshold for the confidence of inferring the sensitive property given the identifying attributes.We show that suppressing the domain values monotonically decreases the maximumconfidence of such sensitive inferences. Hence; we propose a data transformation thatminimally suppresses the domain values in the data to satisfy the set of privacy templates …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2007,138
Mining customer value: From association rules to direct marketing,Ke Wang; Senqiang Zhou; Qiang Yang; Jack Man Shun Yeung,Abstract Direct marketing is a modern business activity with an aim to maximize the profitgenerated from marketing to a selected group of customers. A key to direct marketing is toselect a subset of customers so as to maximize the profit return while minimizing the cost.Achieving this goal is difficult due to the extremely imbalanced data and the inversecorrelation between the probability that a customer responds and the dollar amountgenerated by a response. We present a solution to this problem based on a creative use ofassociation rules. Association rule mining searches for all rules above an interestingnessthreshold; as opposed to some rules in a heuristic-based search. Promising associationrules are then selected based on the observed value of the customers they summarize.Selected association rules are used to build a model for predicting the value of a future …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2005,133
Scalable sequential pattern mining for biological sequences,Ke Wang; Yabo Xu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Biosequences typically have a small alphabet; a long length; and patternscontaining gaps (ie;" don't care") of arbitrary size. Mining frequent patterns in suchsequences faces a different type of explosion than in transaction sequences primarilymotivated in market-basket analysis. In this paper; we study how this explosion affects theclassic sequential pattern mining; and present a scalable two-phase algorithm to deal withthis new explosion. The< i> Segment Phase</i> first searches for short patterns containingno gaps; called< i> segments</i>. This phase is efficient. The< i> Pattern Phase</i>searches for long patterns containing multiple segments separated by variable length gaps.This phase is time consuming. The purpose of two phases is to exploit the informationobtained from the first phase to speed up the pattern growth and matching and to prune …,Proceedings of the thirteenth ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2004,127
Schema Discovery for Semistructured Data.,Ke Wang; Huiqing Liu,Abstract To formulate a meaningful query on semistructured data; such as on the Web; thatmatches some of the source's structure; we need first to discover something about how theinformation is represented in the source. This is referred to as schema discovery and wasconsidered for a single object recently. In the case of multiple objects; the task of schemadiscovery is to identify typical structurine: information of those objects as a whole. Wemitivate the schema discovery in this general setting and propose a framework andalgorithm for it. We apply the framework to a real Web database; the Internet MoviesDatabase; to discover typical schema of most voted movies.,KDD,1997,127
Anonymity for continuous data publishing,Benjamin Fung; Ke Wang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jian Pei,Abstract k-anonymization is an important privacy protection mechanism in data publishing.While there has been a great deal of work in recent years; almost all considered a singlestatic release. Such mechanisms only protect the data up to the first release or first recipient.In practical applications; data is published continuously as new data arrive; the same datamay be anonymized differently for a different purpose or a different recipient. In suchscenarios; even when all releases are properly k-anonymized; the anonymity of anindividual may be unintentionally compromised if recipient cross-examines all the releasesreceived or colludes with other recipients. Preventing such attacks; called correspondenceattacks; faces major challenges. In this paper; we systematically characterize thecorrespondence attacks and propose an efficient anonymization algorithm to thwart the …,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,125
Interestingness-Based Interval Merger for Numeric Association Rules.,Ke Wang; Soon Hock William Tay; Bing Liu,Abstract We present aa algorithm for mining association rules from relational tablescontaining numeric and categorical attributes. The approach is to merge adjacent intervalsof numeric values; in a bottom-up manner; on the basis of maximizing the interestingness ofa set of association rules. A modification of the B-tree is adopted for performing this taskefficiently. The algorithm takes O (kN) I/O time; where k is the number of attributes and N isthe number of rows in the table. We evaluate the effectiveness of producing good intervals.,KDD,1998,125

Extracting interpretable features for early classification on time series,Zhengzheng Xing; Jian Pei; Philip S Yu; Ke Wang,Abstract Early classification on time series data has been found highly useful in a fewimportant applications; such as medical and health informatics; industry productionmanagement; safety and security management. While some classifiers have been proposedto achieve good earliness in classification; the interpretability of early classification remainslargely an open problem. Without interpretable features; application domain experts such asmedical doctors may be reluctant to adopt early classification. In this paper; we tackle theproblem of extracting interpretable features on time series for early classification.Specifically; we advocate local shapelets as features; which are segments of time seriesremaining in the same space of the input data and thus are highly interpretable. We extractlocal shapelets distinctly manifesting a target class locally and early so that they are …,*,2011,117
Template-based privacy preservation in classification problems,Ke Wang; Benjamin CM Fung; Philip S Yu,In this paper; we present a template-based privacy preservation to protect against the threatscaused by data mining abilities. The problem has dual goals: preserve the information for awanted classification analysis and limit the usefulness of unwanted sensitive inferences thatmay be derived from the data. Sensitive inferences are specified by a set of" privacytemplates". Each template specifies the sensitive information to be protected; a set ofidentifying attributes; and the maximum association between the two. We show thatsuppressing the domain values is an effective way to eliminate sensitive inferences. For alarge data set; finding an optimal suppression is hard; since it requires optimization over allsuppressions. We present an approximate but scalable solution. We demonstrate theeffectiveness of this approach on real life data sets.,Data Mining; Fifth IEEE International Conference on,2005,115
Privacy-preserving trajectory data publishing by local suppression,Rui Chen; Benjamin CM Fung; Noman Mohammed; Bipin C Desai; Ke Wang,Abstract The pervasiveness of location-aware devices has spawned extensive research intrajectory data mining; resulting in many important real-life applications. Yet; the privacyissue in sharing trajectory data among different parties often creates an obstacle for effectivedata mining. In this paper; we study the challenges of anonymizing trajectory data: highdimensionality; sparseness; and sequentiality. Employing traditional privacy models andanonymization methods often leads to low data utility in the resulting data and ineffectivedata mining. In addressing these challenges; this is the first paper to introduce localsuppression to achieve a tailored privacy model for trajectory data anonymization. Theframework allows the adoption of various data utility metrics for different data mining tasks.As an illustration; we aim at preserving both instances of location-time doublets and …,Information Sciences,2013,110
Profit mining: From patterns to actions,Ke Wang; Senqiang Zhou; Jiawei Han,Abstract A major obstacle in data mining applications is the gap between the statistic-basedpattern extraction and the value-based decision making. We present a profit miningapproach to reduce this gap. In profit mining; we are given a set of past transactions and pre-selected target items; and we like to build a model for recommending target items andpromotion strategies to new customers; with the goal of maximizing the net profit. We identifyseveral issues in profit mining and propose solutions. We evaluate the effectiveness of thisapproach using data sets of a wide range of characteristics.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2002,105
Maintaining k-anonymity against incremental updates,Jian Pei; Jian Xu; Zhibin Wang; Wei Wang; Ke Wang,K-anonymity is a simple yet practical mechanismto protect privacy against attacks of re-identifying individuals by joining multiple public data sources. All existing methods achievingk-anonymity assume implicitly that the data objects to be anonymized are given once andfixed. However; in many applications; the real world data sources are dynamic. In this paper;we investigate the problem of maintaining k-anonymity against incremental updates; andpropose a simple yet effective solution. We analyze how inferences from multiple releasesmay temper the k-anonymity of data; and propose the monotonic incremental anonymizationproperty. The general idea is to progressively and consistently reduce the generalizationgranularity as incremental updates arrive. Our new approach guarantees the k-anonymity oneach release; and also on the inferred table using multiple releases. At the same time; our …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2007.

Discovering frequent closed partial orders from strings,Jian Pei; Haixun Wang; Jian Liu; Ke Wang; Jianyong Wang; Philip S Yu,Mining knowledge about ordering from sequence data is an important problem with manyapplications; such as bioinformatics; Web mining; network management; and intrusiondetection. For example; if many customers follow a partial order in their purchases of aseries of products; the partial order can be used to predict other related customers' futurepurchases and develop marketing campaigns. Moreover; some biological sequences (eg;microarray data) can be clustered based on the partial orders shared by the sequences.Given a set of items; a total order of a subset of items can be represented as a string. A stringdatabase is a multiset of strings. In this paper; we identify a novel problem of mining frequentclosed partial orders from strings. Frequent closed partial orders capture the nonredundantand interesting ordering information from string databases. Importantly; mining frequent …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2006,96
Building association-rule based sequential classifiers for web-document prediction,Qiang Yang; Tianyi Li; Ke Wang,Abstract Web servers keep track of web users' browsing behavior in web logs. From theselogs; one can build statistical models that predict the users' next requests based on theircurrent behavior. These data are complex due to their large size and sequential nature. Inthe past; researchers have proposed different methods for building association-rule basedprediction models using the web logs; but there has been no systematic study on the relativemerits of these methods. In this paper; we provide a comparative study on different kinds ofsequential association rules for web document prediction. We show that the existingapproaches can be cast under two important dimensions; namely the type of antecedents ofrules and the criterion for selecting prediction rules. From this comparison we propose a bestoverall method and empirically test the proposed model on real web logs.,Data mining and knowledge discovery,2004,94
Pushing support constraints into association rules mining,Ke Wang; Yu He; Jiawei Han,Interesting patterns often occur at varied levels of support. The classic association miningbased on a uniform minimum support; such as Apriori; either misses interesting patterns oflow support or suffers from the bottleneck of itemset generation caused by a low minimumsupport. A better solution lies in exploiting support constraints; which specify what minimumsupport is required for what itemsets; so that only the necessary itemsets are generated. Wepresent a framework of frequent itemset mining in the presence of support constraints. Ourapproach is to" push" support constraints into the Apriori itemset generation so that the" best"minimum support is determined for each itemset at runtime to preserve the essence ofApriori. This strategy is called Adaptive Apriori. Experiments show that Adapative Apriori ishighly effective in dealing with the bottleneck of itemset generation.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2003,92
Frequent-subsequence-based prediction of outer membrane proteins,Rong She; Fei Chen; Ke Wang; Martin Ester; Jennifer L Gardy; Fiona SL Brinkman,Abstract A number of medically important disease-causing bacteria (collectively called Gram-negative bacteria) are noted for the extra" outer" membrane that surrounds their cell.Proteins resident in this membrane (outer membrane proteins; or OMPs) are of primaryresearch interest for antibiotic and vaccine drug design as they are on the surface of thebacteria and so are the most accessible targets to develop new drugs against. With thedevelopment of genome sequencing technology and bioinformatics; biologists can nowdeduce all the proteins that are likely produced in a given bacteria and have attempted toclassify where proteins are located in a bacterial cell. However such protein localizationprograms are currently least accurate when predicting OMPs; and so there is a current needfor the development of a better OMP classifier.

Item selection by hub-authority profit ranking,Ke Wang; Ming-Yen Thomas Su,Abstract A fundamental problem in business and other applications is ranking items withrespect to some notion of profit based on historical transactions. The difficulty is that the profitof one item not only comes from its own sales; but also from its influence on the sales ofother items; ie; the" cross-selling effect". In this paper; we draw an analogy between thisinfluence and the mutual reinforcement of hub/authority web pages. Based on this analogy;we present a novel approach to the item ranking problem. We apply this ranking approach tosolve two selection problems. In size-constrained selection; the maximum number of itemsthat can be selected is fixed.

Electrochemical reactions of lithium with CuP2 and Li1. 75Cu1. 25P2 synthesized by ballmilling,Ke Wang; Jun Yang; Jingying Xie; Baofeng Wang; Zhongsheng Wen,Abstract Copper phosphide (CuP 2) and lithium copper phosphide (Li 1.75-Cu 1.25 P 2)were synthesized by high-energy ballmilling at room temperature. The electrochemicalreactions between lithium and these samples have been studied. The first lithium insertioninto the CuP 2 phase till 0.0 V vs. Li leads to copper reduction and the formation of lithiumphosphide (Li 3 P); corresponding to a long voltage plateau. The subsequent lithiumextraction until 1.3 V vs. Li presents three voltage plateaus related to the formation of newphases such as Li 2 CuP; giving a reversible capacity about 810 mAh/g and faradic yieldabout 61%. It means that both copper and phosphorus face a change of the oxidation statefor the electrochemical insertion and extraction. Lithium copper phosphide exhibits a similarreaction process. However; it provides a reversible capacity of 750 mAh/g and faradic …,Electrochemistry communications,2003,82
Topicsketch: Real-time bursty topic detection from twitter,Wei Xie; Feida Zhu; Jing Jiang; Ee-Peng Lim; Ke Wang,Twitter has become one of the largest microblogging platforms for users around the world toshare anything happening around them with friends and beyond. A bursty topic in Twitter isone that triggers a surge of relevant tweets within a short period of time; which often reflectsimportant events of mass interest. How to leverage Twitter for early detection of bursty topicshas therefore become an important research problem with immense practical value. Despitethe wealth of research work on topic modelling and analysis in Twitter; it remains achallenge to detect bursty topics in real-time. As existing methods can hardly scale to handlethe task with the tweet stream in real-time; we propose in this paper $\sf {TopicSketch} $; asketch-based topic model together with a set of techniques to achieve real-time detection.We evaluate our solution on a tweet stream with over 30 million tweets.

Automated load curve data cleansing in power systems,Jiyi Chen; Wenyuan Li; Adriel Lau; Jiguo Cao; Ke Wang,Load curve data refers to the electric energy consumption recorded by meters at certain timeintervals at delivery points or end user points; and contains vital information for day-to-dayoperations; system analysis; system visualization; system reliability performance; energysaving and adequacy in system planning. Unfortunately; it is unavoidable that load curvescontain corrupted data and missing data due to various random failure factors in meters andtransfer processes. This paper presents the B-Spline smoothing and Kernel smoothingbased techniques to automatically cleanse corrupted and missing data. In implementation; aman-machine dialogue procedure is proposed to enhance the performance. The experimentresults on the real British Columbia Transmission Corporation (BCTC) load curve datademonstrated the effectiveness of the presented solution.,IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid,2010,81
Mining confident rules without support requirement,Ke Wang; Yu He; David W Cheung,Abstract An open problem is to find all rules that satisfy a minimum confidence but notnecessarily a minimum support. Without the support requirement; the classic support-basedpruning strategy is inapplicable. The problem demands a confidence-based pruningstrategy. In particular; the following monotonicity of confidence; called the universal-existential upward closure; holds: if a rule of size k is confident (for the given minimumconfidence); for every other attribute not in the rule; some specialization of size k+ 1 usingthe attribute must be confident. Like the support-based pruning; the bottleneck is at thememory that often is too small to store the candidates required for search. We implement thisstrategy on disk and study its performance.,Proceedings of the tenth international conference on Information and knowledge management,2001,80
Mining multi-dimensional constrained gradients in data cubes,Guozhu Dong; Jiawei Han; Joyce Lam; Jian Pei; Ke Wang,Abstract Constrained gradient analysis (similar to the “cubegrade” problem posed byImielinski; et al.[9]) is to extract pairs of similar cell characteristics associated with bigchanges in measure in a data cube. Cells are considered similar if they are related by roll-up; drill-down; or 1-dimensional mutation operation. Constrained gradient queries areexpressive; capable of capturing trends in data and answering “what-if” questions. Tofacilitate our discussion; we call one cell in a gradient pair probe cell and the other gradientcell. An efficient algorithm is developed; which pushes constraints deep into the computationprocess; finding all gradient-probe cell pairs in one pass. It explores bi-directional pruningbetween probe cells and gradient cells; utilizing transformed measures and dimensions.Moreover; it adopts a hyper-tree structure and an H-cubing method to compress data and …,VLDB,2001,78
Privacy-preserving data mashup,Noman Mohammed; Benjamin Fung; Ke Wang; Patrick CK Hung,Abstract Mashup is a web technology that combines information from more than one sourceinto a single web application. This technique provides a new platform for different dataproviders to flexibly integrate their expertise and deliver highly customizable services to theircustomers. Nonetheless; combining data from different sources could potentially revealperson-specific sensitive information. In this paper; we study and resolve a real-life privacyproblem in a data mashup application for the financial industry in Sweden; and propose aprivacy-preserving data mashup (PPMashup) algorithm to securely integrate private datafrom different data providers; whereas the integrated data still retains the essentialinformation for supporting general data exploration or a specific data mining task; such asclassification analysis.

Hierarchical classification of real life documents,Ke Wang; Senqiang Zhou; Yu He,1 Introduction Two features have successfully made on-line information comprehensible andaccessible to people: hierarchically structured classes where topics are organized into ahierarchy of increasing specificity; and multi-classed documents where a document isclassified into all relevant classes. One such information source is Yahoo! where adocument on Dance; for example; could be reached from both Arts: Performing_Arts andRecreation topics in the topic hierarchy. The hierarchical feature of classes allowsinformation to be examined and browsed at various topic specificities; and the multi-classfeature allows information to be accessed from all related topics. However; most documentclassification techniques assume that there is a flat class space and each document has oneclass. The documents classified by such techniques are difficult to browse and access by …,*,2001,73
Direct discovery of high utility itemsets without candidate generation,Junqiang Liu; Ke Wang; Benjamin CM Fung,Utility mining emerged recently to address the limitation of frequent itemset mining byintroducing interestingness measures that reflect both the statistical significance and theuser's expectation. Among utility mining problems; utility mining with the itemset shareframework is a hard one as no anti-monotone property holds with the interestingnessmeasure. The state-of-the-art works on this problem all employ a two-phase; candidategeneration approach; which suffers from the scalability issue due to the huge number ofcandidates. This paper proposes a high utility itemset growth approach that works in a singlephase without generating candidates. Our basic approach is to enumerate itemsets by prefixextensions; to prune search space by utility upper bounding; and to maintain original utilityinformation in the mining process by a novel data structure. Such a data structure enables …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on,2012,72
Discovering patterns from large and dynamic sequential data,Ke Wang,Abstract Most daily and scientific data are sequential in nature. Discoveringimportantpatterns from such data can benefit the user and scientist bypredicting coming activities;interpreting recurring phenomena; extractingoutstanding similarities and differences forclose attention; compressingdata; and detecting intrusion. We consider the followingincrementaldiscovery problem for large and dynamic sequential data. Suppose thatpatternswere previously discovered and materialized. An update is made tothe sequential database.An incremental discovery will take advantage ofdiscovered patterns and compute only thechange by accessing the affectedpart of the database and data structures. In addition topatterns; thestatistics and position information of patterns need to be updated to allowfurtheranalysis and processing on patterns.

Data mining for inventory item selection with cross-selling considerations,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang,Abstract Association rule mining; studied for over ten years in the literature of data mining;aims to help enterprises with sophisticated decision making; but the resulting rules typicallycannot be directly applied and require further processing. In this paper; we propose amethod for actionable recommendations from itemset analysis and investigate anapplication of the concepts of association rules—maximal-profit item selection with cross-selling effect (MPIS). This problem is about choosing a subset of items which can give themaximal profit with the consideration of cross-selling effect. A simple approach to thisproblem is shown to be NP-hard. A new approach is proposed with consideration of the lossrule—a rule similar to the association rule—to model the cross-selling effect. We show thatMPIS can be approximated by a quadratic programming problem. We also propose a …,Data mining and knowledge discovery,2005,68
Collective spatial keyword queries: a distance owner-driven approach,Cheng Long; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ke Wang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Abstract Recently; spatial keyword queries become a hot topic in the literature. One exampleof these queries is the collective spatial keyword query (CoSKQ) which is to find a set ofobjects in the database such that it covers a set of given keywords collectively and has thesmallest cost. Unfortunately; existing exact algorithms have severe scalability problems andexisting approximate algorithms; though scalable; cannot guarantee near-to-optimalsolutions. In this paper; we study the CoSKQ problem and address the above issues. Firstly;we consider the CoSKQ problem using an existing cost measurement called the maximumsum cost. This problem is called MaxSum-CoSKQ and is known to be NP-hard. We observethat the maximum sum cost of a set of objects is dominated by at most three objects whichwe call the distance owners of the set. Motivated by this; we propose a distance owner …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,67
Mining association rules from stars,E Ka Ka Ng; A Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang,Association rule mining is an important data mining problem. It is found to be useful forconventional relational data. However; previous work has mostly targeted on mining a singletable. In real life; a database is typically made up of multiple tables and one important caseis where some of the tables form a star schema. The tables typically correspond to entity setsand joining the tables in a star schema gives relationships among entity sets which can bevery interesting information. Hence mining on the join result is an important problem. Basedon characteristics of the star schema we propose an efficient algorithm for miningassociation rules on the join result but without actually performing the join operation. Weshow that this approach can significantly out-perform the join-then-mine approach evenwhen the latter adopts a fastest known mining algorithm.,Data Mining; 2002. ICDM 2003.

Visually aided exploration of interesting association rules,Bing Liu; Wynne Hsu; Ke Wang; Shu Chen,Abstract Association rules are a class of important regularities in databases. They are foundto be very useful in practical applications. However; the number of association rulesdiscovered in a database can be huge; thus making manual inspection and analysis of therules difficult. In this paper; we propose a new framework to allow the user to explore thediscovered rules to identify those interesting ones. This framework has two components; aninterestingness analysis component; and a visualization component. The interestingnessanalysis component analyzes and organizes the discovered rules according to variousinterestingness criteria with respect to the user's existing knowledge. The visualizationcomponent enables the user to visually explore those potentially interesting rules. The keystrength of the visualization component is that from a single screen; the user is able to …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,1999,65
GenBlastA: enabling BLAST to identify homologous gene sequences,Rong She; Jeffrey S-C Chu; Ke Wang; Jian Pei; Nansheng Chen,Abstract BLAST is an extensively used local similarity search tool for identifying homologoussequences. When a gene sequence (either protein sequence or nucleotide sequence) isused as a query to search for homologous sequences in a genome; the search results;represented as a list of high-scoring pairs (HSPs); are fragments of candidate genes ratherthan full-length candidate genes. Relevant HSPs (“signals”); which represent candidategenes in the target genome sequences; are buried within a report that contains alsohundreds to thousands of random HSPs (“noises”). Consequently; BLAST results are oftenoverwhelming and confusing even to experienced users. For effective use of BLAST; aprogram is needed for extracting relevant HSPs that represent candidate homologous genesfrom the entire HSP report. To achieve this goal; we have designed a graph-based …,Genome research,2009,60
Publishing sensitive transactions for itemset utility,Yabo Xu; Benjamin CM Fung; Ke Wang; Ada WC Fu; Jian Pei,We consider the problem of publishing sensitive transaction data with privacy preservation.High dimensionality of transaction data poses unique challenges on data privacy and datautility. On one hand; re-identification attacks tend to use a subset of items that infrequentlyoccur in transactions; called moles. On the other hand; data mining applications typicallydepend on subsets of items that frequently occur in transactions; called nuggets. Thus theproblem is how to eliminate all moles while retaining nuggets as much as possible. Achallenge is that moles and nuggets are multi-dimensional with exponential growth and aretangled together by shared items. We present a novel and scalable solution to this problem.The novelty lies in a compact border data structure that eliminates the need of generating allmoles and nuggets.,Data Mining; 2008. ICDM'08.

Mining constrained gradients in large databases,Guozhu Dong; Jiawei Han; JWM Lam; Jian Pei; K Wangm; Wei Zou,Many data analysis tasks can be viewed as search or mining in a multidimensional space(MDS). In such MDSs; dimensions capture potentially important factors for givenapplications; and cells represent combinations of values for the factors. To systematicallyanalyze data in MDS; an interesting notion; called" cubegrade" was recently introduced byImielinski et al.[2002]; which focuses on the notable changes in measures in MDS bycomparing a cell (which we refer to as probe cell) with its gradient cells; namely; itsancestors; descendants; and siblings. We call such queries gradient analysis queries (GQs).Since an MDS can contain billions of cells; it is important to answer GQs efficiently. We focuson developing efficient methods for mining GQs constrained by certain (weakly)antimonotone constraints. Instead of conducting an independent gradient-cell search …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,54
Mining unexpected rules by pushing user dynamics,Ke Wang; Yuelong Jiang; Laks VS Lakshmanan,Abstract Unexpected rules are interesting because they are either previously unknown ordeviate from what prior user knowledge would suggest. In this paper; we study threeimportant issues that have been previously ignored in mining unexpected rules. First; theunexpectedness of a rule depends on how the user prefers to apply the prior knowledge to agiven scenario; in addition to the knowledge itself. Second; the prior knowledge should beconsidered right from the start to focus the search on unexpected rules. Third; theunexpectedness of a rule depends on what other rules the user has seen so far. Thus; onlyrules that remain unexpected given what the user has seen should be consideredinteresting. We develop an approach that addresses all three problems above and evaluateit by means of experiments focusing on finding interesting rules.,Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2003,54
Mining actionable patterns by role models,Ke Wang; Yuelong Jiang; Alexander Tuzhilin,Data mining promises to discover valid and potentially useful patterns in data. Often;discovered patterns are not useful to the user." Actionability" addresses this problem in that apattern is deemed actionable if the user can act upon it in her favor. We introduce the notionof" action" as a domain-independent way to model the domain knowledge. Given a data setabout actionable features and an utility measure; a pattern is actionable if it summarizes apopulation that can be acted upon towards a more promising population observed with ahigher utility. We present several pruning strategies taking into account the actionabilityrequirement to reduce the search space; and algorithms for mining all actionable patterns aswell as mining the top k actionable patterns. We evaluate the usefulness of patterns and thefocus of search on a real-world application domain.,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06. Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on,2006,53
Discovering frequent substructures from hierarchical semi-structured data,Gao Cong; Lan Yi; Bing Liu; Ke Wang,Abstract Frequent substructure discovery from a collection of semi-structured objects canserve for storage; browsing; querying; indexing and classification of semi-structureddocuments. This paper examines the problem of discovering frequent substructures from acollection of hierarchical semi-structured objects of the same type. The use of wildcard is animportant aspect of substructure discovery from semi-structured data due to the irregularityand lack of fixed structure of such data. This paper proposes a more general and powerfulwildcard mechanism; which allows us to find more complex and interesting substructuresthan existing techniques. Furthermore; the complexity of structural information of semi-structured data and the usage of wildcard make the existing frequent set mining algorithmsinapplicable for substructure discovery.

Can the utility of anonymized data be used for privacy breaches?,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang; Philip S Yu; Jian Pei,Abstract Group based anonymization is the most widely studied approach for privacy-preserving data publishing. Privacy models/definitions using group based anonymizationincludes k-anonymity; l-diversity; and t-closeness; to name a few. The goal of this article is toraise a fundamental issue regarding the privacy exposure of the approaches using groupbased anonymization. This has been overlooked in the past. The group basedanonymization approach by bucketization basically hides each individual record behind agroup to preserve data privacy. If not properly anonymized; patterns can actually be derivedfrom the published data and be used by an adversary to breach individual privacy.

Mining changes of classification by correspondence tracing,Ke Wang; Senqiang Zhou; Chee Ada Fu; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract We study the problem of mining changes of classification characteristics as the datachanges. Available are an old classifier; representing previous knowledge aboutclassification characteristics; and a new data. We want to find the changes of classificationcharacteristics in the new data. An example of such changes is “members with a large familyno longer shop frequently; but they used to”. Finding this kind of changes holds the key forthe organization to adopt to the changed environment and stay ahead of competitors. Thechallenge is that it is difficult to see what has really changed from comparing the old andnew classifiers that could be very large and different. In this paper; we propose a techniqueto identify such changes. The idea is tracing the characteristics; in the old and newclassifiers; that correspond to each other by classifying the same examples.

Incremental discovery of sequential patterns,Ke Wang; Jye Tan,Abstract In this paper; incremental discovery of sequential patterns from a large sequencedatabase is studied. A sequential pattern has the form a→ β; where a and β aresubsequences in the database; which says that events a will be followed by events β withsome minimum support and confidence. We consider the scenario that sequential patternshave previously been discovered and materialized and an update is subsequently made tothe database. Rediscovering all patterns by scanning the whole database is not acceptablein a dynamic and large database environment. We propose an incremental discoveryalgorithm that produces the updated patterns by scanning only the affected part of thedatabase and data structures. In addition; the algorithm handles the dynamism of theminimum support and confidence without recomputation; allowing the user to tune these …,1996 ACM SIGMOD Data Mining Workshop: Research Issues on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery (SIGMOD’96),1996,49
Online anonymity for personalized web services,Yabo Xu; Ke Wang; Guoliang Yang; Ada WC Fu,Abstract To receive personalized web services; the user has to provide personal informationand preferences; in addition to the query itself; to the web service. However; detailedpersonal information could identify the sender of sensitive queries; thus compromise userprivacy. We propose the notion of online anonymity to enable users to issue personalizedqueries to an untrusted web service while with their anonymity preserved. The challenge forproviding online anonymity is dealing with unknown and dynamic web users who can getonline and offline at any time. We define this problem; discuss its implications anddifferences from the problems in the literature; and propose a solution.,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,48
Integrating private databases for data analysis,Ke Wang; Benjamin CM Fung; Guozhu Dong,Abstract In today's globally networked society; there is a dual demand on both informationsharing and information protection. A typical scenario is that two parties wish to integratetheir private databases to achieve a common goal beneficial to both; provided that theirprivacy requirements are satisfied. In this paper; we consider the goal of building a classifierover the integrated data while satisfying the k-anonymity privacy requirement. The k-anonymity requirement states that domain values are generalized so that each value ofsome specified attributes identifies at least k records. The generalization process must notleak more specific information other than the final integrated data. We present a practicaland efficient solution to this problem.,International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics,2005,46
genBlastG: using BLAST searches to build homologous gene models,Rong She; Jeffrey Shih-Chieh Chu; Bora Uyar; Jun Wang; Ke Wang; Nansheng Chen,Abstract Motivation: BLAST users frequently expect to obtain homologous genes with certainsimilarity to their query genes. But what they get from BLAST searches are often collectionsof local alignments called high-scoring segment pairs (HSPs). On the other hand; mosthomology-based gene finders have been built using computation-intensive algorithms;without taking full advantage of BLAST searches that have been perfected over the lastdecades.

On optimal anonymization for l+-diversity,Junqiang Liu; Ke Wang,Publishing person specific data while protecting privacy is an important problem. Existingalgorithms that enforce the privacy principle called l-diversity are heuristic based due to theNP-hardness. Several questions remain open: can we get a significant gain in the data utilityfrom an optimal solution compared to heuristic ones; can we improve the utility by setting adistinct privacy threshold per sensitive value; is it practical to find an optimal solutionefficiently for real world datasets. This paper addresses these questions. Specifically; wepresent a pruning based algorithm for finding an optimal solution to an extended form of the l-diversity problem. The novelty lies in several strong techniques: a novel structure forenumerating all solutions; methods for estimating cost lower bounds; strategies fordynamically arranging the enumeration order and updating lower bounds.

Summarizing review scores of “unequal” reviewers,Hady W Lauw; Ee-Peng Lim; Ke Wang,Abstract A frequently encountered problem in decision making is the following reviewproblem: review a large number of objects and select a small number of the best ones. Anexample is selecting conference papers from a large number of submissions. This probleminvolves two sub-problems: assigning reviewers to each object; and summarizing reviewers'scores into an overall score that supposedly reflects the quality of an object. In this paper; weaddress the score summarization sub-problem for the scenario where a small number ofreviewers evaluate each object. Simply averaging the scores may not work as even a singlereviewer could influence the average significantly.

MPIS: Maximal-profit item selection with cross-selling considerations,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang,In the literature of data mining; many different algorithms for association rule mining havebeen proposed. However; there is relatively little study on how association rules can aid inmore specific targets. One of the applications for association rules-maximal-profit itemselection with cross-selling effect (MPIS) problem-is investigated. The problem is aboutselecting a subset of items; which can give the maximal profit with the consideration of cross-selling. We prove that a simple version of this problem is NP-hard. We propose a newapproach to the problem with the consideration of the loss rule-a kind of association rule tomodel the cross-selling effect. We show that the problem can be transformed to a quadraticprogramming problem. In case quadratic programming is not applicable; we also propose aheuristic approach.

Small domain randomization: same privacy; more utility,Rhonda Chaytor; Ke Wang,Abstract Random perturbation is a promising technique for privacy preserving data mining. Itretains an original sensitive value with a certain probability and replaces it with a randomvalue from the domain with the remaining probability. If the replacing value is chosen from alarge domain; the retention probability must be small to protect privacy. For this reason;previous randomization-based approaches have poor utility. In this paper; we propose analternative way to randomize sensitive values; called small domain randomization. First; wepartition the given table into sub-tables that have smaller domains of sensitive values. Then;we randomize the sensitive values within each sub-table independently. Since each sub-table has a smaller domain; a larger retention probability is permitted. We propose thisapproach as an alternative to classical partition-based approaches to privacy preserving …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,37
Concurrent discretization of multiple attributes,Ke Wang; Bing Liu,Abstract Better decision trees can be learnt by merging continuous values into intervals.Merging of values; however; could introduce inconsistencies to the data; or information loss.When it is desired to maintain a certain consistency; interval mergings in one attribute coulddisable those in another attribute. This interaction raises the issue of determining the orderof mergings. We consider a globally greedy heuristic that selects the “best” merging from allcontinuous attributes at each step. We present an implementation of the heuristic in whichthe best merging is determined in a time independent of the number of possible mergings.Experiments show that intervals produced by the heuristic lead to improved decision trees.,Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence,1998,37

The partition and processing schemes defined in thispaper are more general than those in existing strategies. A parallel evaluation algorithm isgiven based on the semi-naive bottom-up evaluation. A notion of potential usefulness isrecognized as a data transmission criterion to reduce; both effectively and efficiently; theamount of data transmitted.

Anonymizing transaction data by integrating suppression and generalization,Junqiang Liu; Ke Wang,Abstract Privacy protection in publishing transaction data is an important problem. A keyfeature of transaction data is the extreme sparsity; which renders any single techniqueineffective in anonymizing such data. Among recent works; some incur high information loss;some result in data hard to interpret; and some suffer from performance drawbacks. Thispaper proposes to integrate generalization and suppression to reduce information loss.However; the integration is non-trivial. We propose novel techniques to address theefficiency and scalability challenges. Extensive experiments on real world databases showthat this approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods; including global generalization;local generalization; and total suppression. In addition; transaction data anonymized by thisapproach can be analyzed by standard data mining tools; a property that local …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2010,36

Synteny blocks; which are conserved blocks ofgenes on chromosomes of related species; play important roles in comparative genomicsanalysis. Although a few tools have been designed to identify synteny blocks; most of themcannot handle some challenging application requirements; particularly the strandedness ofgenes; gene inversions; gene duplications; and comparison of more than two genomes.

Bias and controversy: beyond the statistical deviation,Hady W Lauw; Ee-Peng Lim; Ke Wang,Abstract In this paper; we investigate how deviation in evaluation activities may reveal biason the part of reviewers and controversy on the part of evaluated objects. We focus on a'data-centric approach'where the evaluation data is assumed to represent the'ground truth'. Thestandard statistical approaches take evaluation and deviation at face value. We argue thatattention should be paid to the subjectivity of evaluation; judging the evaluation score notjust on'what is being said'(deviation); but also on'who says it'(reviewer) as well as on'whom itis said about'(object). Furthermore; we observe that bias and controversy are mutuallydependent; as there is more bias if there is higher deviation on a less controversial object.To address this mutual dependency; we propose a reinforcement model to identify bias andcontroversy. We test our model on real-life data to verify its applicability.,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,34
Privacy-preserving frequent pattern mining across private databases,AW-C Fu; RC-W Wong; Ke Wang,Privacy consideration has much significance in the application of data mining. It is veryimportant that the privacy of individual parties is not exposed when data mining techniquesare applied to a large collection of data about the parties. In many scenarios such as datawarehousing or data integration; data from the different parties form a many-to-manyschema. This paper addresses the problem of privacy-preserving frequent pattern mining insuch a schema across two dimension sites. We assume that sites are not trusted and theyare semi-honest. Our method is based on the concept of semi-join and does not involve dataencryption which is used in most previous work. Experiments are conducted to study theefficiency of the proposed models.,Data Mining; Fifth IEEE International Conference on,2005,34

With the advent of Web 2.0; online evaluation hasbecome an important feature in many applications that involve information (eg; video; photo;and audio) sharing and social networking (eg; blogging). In these evaluation settings; a setof reviewers assign scores to a set of objects. As part of the evaluation analysis; we want toobtain fair reviews for all the given objects. However; the reality is that reviewers maydeviate in their scores assigned to the same object; due to the potential" bias" of reviewersor" controversy" of objects. The statistical approach of averaging deviations to determinebias and controversy assumes that all reviewers and objects should be given equal weight.In this paper; we look beyond this assumption and propose an approach based on thefollowing observations: 1) evaluation is" subjective;" as reviewers and objects have …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2008,31

The existing algorithm for discovering holes has a number of shortcomings. Itrequires each hole to contain no data point; which is too restrictive for many real-lifeapplications. It also has a very high complexity; and produces a huge number of holes.Additionally; the algorithm only works in a continuous space; and does not allow anydiscrete/nominal attribute. These drawbacks limit its applications. In this paper; we proposea novel approach to overcome these shortcomings. This approach transforms the holes-discovery problem into a supervised learning task; and then uses the decision tree …,Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence,1998,30
Online skyline analysis with dynamic preferences on nominal attributes,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Jian Pei; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang,The importance of skyline analysis has been well recognized in multi-criteria decisionmaking applications. All of the previous studies assume a fixed order on the attributes inquestion. However; in some applications; users may be interested in skylines with respect tovarious total or partial orders on nominal attributes. In this paper; we identify and tackle theproblem of online skyline analysis with dynamic preferences on nominal attributes. Weinvestigate how changes of orders in attributes lead to changes of skylines. We address twonovel types of interesting queries: a viewpoint query returns with respect to which orders apoint is (or is not) in the skylines and an order-based skyline query retrieves the skyline withrespect to a specific order. We develop two methods systematically and report an extensiveperformance study using both synthetic and real data sets to verify their effectiveness and …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2009,29
Mining favorable facets,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Jian Pei; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang,Abstract The importance of dominance and skyline analysis has been well recognized inmulti-criteria decision making applications. Most previous studies assume a fixed order onthe attributes. In practice; different customers may have different preferences on nominalattributes. In this paper; we identify an interesting data mining problem; finding favorablefacets; which has not been studied before. Given a set of points in a multidimensional space;for a specific target point p we want to discover with respect to which combinations of orders(eg; customer preferences) on the nominal attributes p is not dominated by any other points.Such combinations are called the favorable facets of p. We consider both the effectivenessand the efficiency of the mining. A given point may have many favorable facets.

Global privacy guarantee in serial data publishing,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jia Liu; Ke Wang; Yabo Xu,While previous works on privacy-preserving serial data publishing consider the scenariowhere sensitive values may persist over multiple data releases; we find that no previouswork has sufficient protection provided for sensitive values that can change over time; whichshould be the more common case. In this work; we propose to study the privacy guaranteefor such transient sensitive values; which we call the global guarantee. We formally definethe problem for achieving this guarantee. We show that the data satisfying the globalguarantee also satisfies a privacy guarantee commonly adopted in the privacy literaturecalled the local guarantee.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,28
A new ternary composite lithium silicon nitride as anode material for lithium ion batteries,Zhongsheng Wen; Ke Wang; Libao Chen; Jingying Xie,Abstract Lithium silicon nitride; a new Li-loaded anode material for lithium ion batteries; wassynthesized by high energy ball milling. The obtained amorphous composite is found topossess high electrochemical active properties of reversible lithium insertion and extraction.A reversible capacity about 500 mAh g− 1 is obtained after the first cycle. The retentioncapacity after 50 cycles is above 400 mAh g− 1; 80% of the reversible capacity of the secondcycle. The structure of the composite is stable even at a high lithium-extraction state and canstill maintain an excellent cycling performance under that cut-off voltage window. It is apromising candidate for capacity-compensation system because of its reversible lithiuminsertion and extraction within a wide voltage cut-off window.,Electrochemistry communications,2006,28
Latent factor transition for dynamic collaborative filtering,Chenyi Zhang; Ke Wang; Hongkun Yu; Jianling Sun; Ee-Peng Lim,Abstract User preferences change over time and capturing such changes is essential fordeveloping accurate recommender systems. Despite its importance; only a few works incollaborative filtering have addressed this issue. In this paper; we consider evolvingpreferences and we model user dynamics by introducing and learning a transition matrix foreach user's latent vectors between consecutive time windows. Intuitively; the transitionmatrix for a user summarizes the time-invariant pattern of the evolution for the user. We firstextend the conventional probabilistic matrix factorization and then improve upon thissolution through its fully Bayesian model. These solutions take advantage of the modelcomplexity and scalability of conventional Bayesian matrix factorization; yet adaptdynamically to user's evolving preferences.

PADS: a simple yet effective pattern-aware dynamic search method for fast maximal frequent pattern mining,Xinghuo Zeng; Jian Pei; Ke Wang; Jinyan Li,Abstract While frequent pattern mining is fundamental for many data mining tasks; miningmaximal frequent patterns efficiently is important in both theory and applications of frequentpattern mining. The fundamental challenge is how to search a large space of itemcombinations. Most of the existing methods search an enumeration tree of itemcombinations in a depth-first manner. In this paper; we develop a new technique for moreefficient max-pattern mining. Our method is pattern-aware: it uses the patterns already foundto schedule its future search so that many search subspaces can be pruned. We presentefficient techniques to implement the new approach. As indicated by a systematic empiricalstudy using the benchmark data sets; our new approach outperforms the currently fastestmax-pattern mining algorithms FPMax* and LCM2 clearly.

Anonymization-based attacks in privacy-preserving data publishing,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang; Jian Pei,Abstract Data publishing generates much concern over the protection of individual privacy.Recent studies consider cases where the adversary may possess different kinds ofknowledge about the data. In this article; we show that knowledge of the mechanism oralgorithm of anonymization for data publication can also lead to extra information that assiststhe adversary and jeopardizes individual privacy. In particular; all known mechanisms try tominimize information loss and such an attempt provides a loophole for attacks. We call suchan attack a minimality attack. In this article; we introduce a model called m-confidentialitywhich deals with minimality attacks; and propose a feasible solution. Our experiments showthat minimality attacks are practical concerns on real datasets and that our algorithm canprevent such attacks with very little overhead and information loss.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2009,24

Mining high utility patterns in one phase without generating candidates,Junqiang Liu; Ke Wang; Benjamin CM Fung,Utility mining is a new development of data mining technology. Among utility miningproblems; utility mining with the itemset share framework is a hard one as no anti-monotonicity property holds with the interestingness measure. Prior works on this problemall employ a two-phase; candidate generation approach with one exception that is howeverinefficient and not scalable with large databases. The two-phase approach suffers fromscalability issue due to the huge number of candidates. This paper proposes a novelalgorithm that finds high utility patterns in a single phase without generating candidates. Thenovelties lie in a high utility pattern growth approach; a lookahead strategy; and a linear datastructure. Concretely; our pattern growth approach is to search a reverse set enumerationtree and to prune search space by utility upper bounding.

A new approach for maximizing bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor search,Yubao Liu; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ke Wang; Zhijie Li; Cheng Chen; Zhitong Chen,Abstract Maximizing bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor (MaxBRNN) is a variant ofbichromatic reverse nearest neighbor (BRNN). The purpose of the MaxBRNN problem is tofind an optimal region that maximizes the size of BRNNs. This problem has lots of realapplications such as location planning and profile-based marketing. The best-knownalgorithm for the MaxBRNN problem is called MaxOverlap. In this paper; we study theMaxBRNN problem and propose a new approach called MaxSegment for a two-dimensionalspace when the L_2-norm is used. Then; we extend our algorithm to other variations of theMaxBRNN problem such as the MaxBRNN problem with other metric spaces; and a three-dimensional space. Finally; we conducted experiments on real and synthetic datasets tocompare our proposed algorithm with existing algorithms. The experimental results verify …,Knowledge and information systems,2013,23

Localization site prediction for membrane proteins by integrating rule and SVM classification,Senqiang Zhou; Ke Wang,We study the localization prediction of membrane proteins for two families of medicallyimportant disease-causing bacteria; called gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Eachsuch bacterium has its cell surrounded by several layers of membranes. Identifying whereproteins are located in a bacterial cell is of primary research interest for antibiotic andvaccine drug design. This problem has three requirements: First; with any subsequence ofamino acid residues being potentially a dimension; it has an extremely high dimensionality;few being irrelevant. Second; the prediction of a target localization site must have a highprecision in order to be useful to biologists; ie; at least 90 percent or even 95 percent; whilerecall is as high as possible. Achieving such a precision is made harder by the fact thattarget sequences are often much fewer than background sequences.

Privacy risk in graph stream publishing for social network data,Nigel Medforth; Ke Wang,To understand how social networks evolve over time; graphs representing the networksneed to be published periodically or on-demand. The identity of the participants (nodes)must be anonymized to protect the privacy of the individuals and their relationships (edges)to the other members in the social network. We identify a new form of privacy attack; whichwe name the degree-trail attack. This attack re-identifies the nodes belonging to a targetparticipant from a sequence of published graphs by comparing the degree of the nodes inthe published graphs with the degree evolution of a target. The power of this attack is thatthe adversary can actively influence the degree of the target individual by interacting with thesocial network. We show that the adversary can succeed with a high probability even ifpublished graphs are anonymized by strongest known privacy preserving techniques in …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on,2011,20
(α; k)-anonymous data publishing,Raymond Wong; Jiuyong Li; Ada Fu; Ke Wang,Abstract Privacy preservation is an important issue in the release of data for miningpurposes. The k-anonymity model has been introduced for protecting individualidentification. Recent studies show that a more sophisticated model is necessary to protectthe association of individuals to sensitive information. In this paper; we propose an (α; k)-anonymity model to protect both identifications and relationships to sensitive information indata. We discuss the properties of (α; k)-anonymity model. We prove that the optimal (α; k)-anonymity problem is NP-hard. We first present an optimal global-recoding method for the(α; k)-anonymity problem. Next we propose two scalable local-recoding algorithms whichare both more scalable and result in less data distortion. The effectiveness and efficiency areshown by experiments.

A framework for privacy-preserving cluster analysis,Benjamin CM Fung; Ke Wang; Lingyu Wang; Mourad Debbabi,Releasing person-specific data could potentially reveal sensitive information of individuals. k-anonymization is a promising privacy protection mechanism in data publishing. Thoughsubstantial research has been conducted on k-anonymization and its extensions in recentyears; few of them consider releasing data for a specific purpose of data analysis. This paperpresents a practical data publishing framework for determining a generalized version of datathat preserves both individual privacy and information usefulness for cluster analysis.Experiments on real-life data suggest that; by focusing on preserving cluster structure in thegeneralization process; the cluster quality is significantly better than the cluster quality on thegeneralized data without such focus.

Answering ad hoc aggregate queries from data streams using prefix aggregate trees,Moonjung Cho; Jian Pei; Ke Wang,Abstract In some business applications such as trading management in financial institutions;it is required to accurately answer ad hoc aggregate queries over data streams.Materializing and incrementally maintaining a full data cube or even its compression orapproximation over a data stream is often computationally prohibitive. On the other hand;although previous studies proposed approximate methods for continuous aggregatequeries; they cannot provide accurate answers. In this paper; we develop a novel prefixaggregate tree (PAT) structure for online warehousing data streams and answering ad hocaggregate queries. Often; a data stream can be partitioned into the historical segment; whichis stored in a traditional data warehouse; and the transient segment; which can be stored ina PAT to answer ad hoc aggregate queries.

An efficient evaluation of a fuzzy equi-join using fuzzy equality indicators,Weining Zhang; Ke Wang,Proposes a new measure of fuzzy equality (FE) comparison based on the similarity ofpossibility distributions. We define a type of fuzzy equi-join based on the new FE comparisonand allow threshold values to be associated with predicates of the join condition. A sort-merge join algorithm based on a partial order of intervals is used to evaluate the fuzzy equi-join. In order for the evaluation to be efficient; we identify various mappings; called FEindicators; that determine appropriate intervals for fuzzy data with different characteristics.Experimental results from our preliminary simulation of the algorithm show a significantimprovement of efficiency when FE indicators are used with the sort-merge join algorithm.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2000,20
Personalized trip recommendation with poi availability and uncertain traveling time,Chenyi Zhang; Hongwei Liang; Ke Wang; Jianling Sun,Abstract As location-based social network (LBSN) services become increasingly popular;trip recommendation that recommends a sequence of points of interest (POIs) to visit for auser emerges as one of many important applications of LBSNs. Personalized triprecommendation tailors to users' specific tastes by learning from past check-in behaviors ofusers and their peers. Finding the optimal trip that maximizes user's experiences for a giventime budget constraint is an NP hard problem and previous solutions do not consider twopractical and important constraints. One constraint is POI availability where a POI may beonly available during a certain time window. Another constraint is uncertain traveling timewhere the traveling time between two POIs is uncertain.

ff-anonymity: When quasi-identifiers are missing,Ke Wang; Yabo Xu; Ada WC Fu; Raymond CW Wong,Existing approaches on privacy-preserving data publishing rely on the assumption that datacan be divided into quasi-identifier attributes (QI) and sensitive attribute (SA). Thisassumption does not hold when an attribute has both sensitive values and identifyingvalues; which is typically the case. In this paper; we study how such attributes would impactthe privacy model and data anonymization. We identify a new form of attacks; called"freeform attacks"; that occur on such data without explicit QI attributes and SA attributes. Wepresent a framework for modeling identifying/sensitive information at the value level; definea problem to eliminate freeform attacks; and outline an efficient solution.,Data Engineering; 2009.

POI recommendation through cross-region collaborative filtering,Chenyi Zhang; Ke Wang,Abstract Recommending points of interest (POIs) to a user according to the user's currentlocation and past check-in activities is the focus in this paper. Previously proposedprobabilistic and topic model-based methods predict the POIs based on the distribution ofthe POIs visited in the past; assuming that the next POI for the user follows the samedistribution. Such methods tend to recommend the POIs in the cities or regions that the userhas visited before because only such cities or regions have observed ratings for the user.Thus; these works are not suitable for a user who travels to a new city or region where shehas not checked-in any POI previously. To address this issue; we distinguish the userpreferences on the content of POIs from the user preferences on the POIs themselves. Theformer is long term and is independent of where POIs are located; and the latter is short …,Knowledge and Information Systems,2016,18
Limiting link disclosure in social network analysis through subgraph-wise perturbation,Amin Milani Fard; Ke Wang; Philip S Yu,Abstract Link disclosure between two individuals in a social network could be a privacybreach. To limit link disclosure; previous works modeled a social network as an undirectedgraph and randomized a link over the entire domain of links; which leads to considerablestructural distortion to the graph. In this work; we address this issue in two steps. First; wemodel a social network as a directed graph and randomize the destination of a link whilekeeping the source of a link intact. The randomization ensures that; if the prior belief aboutthe destination of a link is bounded by some threshold; the posterior belief; given thepublished graph; is no more than another threshold. Then; we further reduce structuraldistortion by a subgraph-wise perturbation in which the given graph is partitioned intoseveral subgraphs and randomization of destination nodes is performed within each …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2012,18
Quality and leniency in online collaborative rating systems,Hady W Lauw; Ee-Peng Lim; Ke Wang,Abstract The emerging trend of social information processing has resulted in Web users'increased reliance on user-generated content contributed by others for informationsearching and decision making. Rating scores; a form of user-generated content contributedby reviewers in online rating systems; allow users to leverage others' opinions in theevaluation of objects. In this article; we focus on the problem of summarizing the ratingscores given to an object into an overall score that reflects the object's quality. We observethat the existing approaches for summarizing scores largely ignores the effect of reviewersexercising different standards in assigning scores. Instead of treating all reviewers asequals; our approach models the leniency of reviewers; which refers to the tendency of areviewer to assign higher scores than other coreviewers. Our approach is underlined by …,ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB),2012,18
Enforcing vocabulary k-anonymity by semantic similarity based clustering,Junqiang Liu; Ke Wang,Web query logs provide a rich wealth of information; but also present serious privacy risks.We consider publishing vocabularies; bags of query-terms extracted from web query logs;which has a variety of applications. We aim at preventing identity disclosure of such bag-valued data. The key feature of such data is the extreme sparsity; which rendersconventional anonymization techniques not working well in retaining enough utility. Wepropose a semantic similarity based clustering approach to address the issue. We measurethe semantic similarity between two vocabularies by a weighted bipartite matching andpresent a greedy algorithm to cluster vocabularies by the semantic similarities.

Detecting X-outliers in load curve data in power systems,Zhihui Guo; Wenyuan Li; Adriel Lau; Tito Inga-Rojas; Ke Wang,Load curve data records the electric energy consumptions at time intervals and plays animportant role in operation and planning of power systems. Unfortunately; load curvesalways contain abnormal; noisy; unrepresentative; and missing data due to various randomfactors. It is crucial to identify and repair such data. Previous works focused on detecting Y-outliers that are unusual power consumptions (Y-axis) in a small temporal neighborhood.This paper presents a different class of X-outliers that have abnormal power consumptionsaccording to a known periodicity (X-axis). The underlying assumption is that the data setfollows a periodicity and the length (not the pattern) of the periodicity is known. This is thecase for most real load curve data collected at BC Hydro.

Electrochemical studies of ternary and quadruple lithium metal nitrides synthesized by ballmilling,Ke Wang; Jun Yang; Jingying Xie; Shichao Zhang,Abstract Quadruple Li 2.6 Co 0.2 Cu 0.2 N and Li 2.6 Ni 0.2 Cu 0.2 N compounds with ahexagonal structure like Li 3 N were synthesized by high-energy ballmilling under N 2atmosphere. The Li 2.6 Co 0.2 Cu 0.2 N sample obtained by using CoCu alloy and Li 3 N asprecursors exhibits high electrochemical activity and reversibility. Its initial specific capacityis 609 mA h/g and 91% of the initial capacity can be retained at the 45th cycle. This resultshows that the Li 2.6 Co 0.2 Cu 0.2 N has better cycling stability than ternary Li 2.6 Co 0.4 Nand Li 2.6 Cu 0.4 N.

Anonymizing temporal data,Ke Wang; Yabo Xu; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Temporal data are time-critical in that the snapshot at each timestamp must be madeavailable to researchers in a timely fashion. However; due to the limited data; each snapshotlikely has a skewed distribution on sensitive values; which renders classical anonymizationmethods not possible. In this work; we propose the “reposition model” to allow a record to bepublished within a close proximity of original timestamp. We show that reposition over asmall proximity of timestamp is sufficient for reducing the skewness of a snapshot; therefore;minimizing the impact on window queries. We formalize the optimal reposition problem andpresent a linear-time solution. The contribution of this work is that it enables classicalmethods on temporal data.,Data Mining (ICDM); 2010 IEEE 10th International Conference on,2010,15

In this work; we construct sequential classifiersfor predicting the users' next visits based on the current actions using association rulemining. The domain feature of Web-log mining entails that we adopt a special kind ofassociation rules we call latest-substring rules; which take into account the temporalinformation as well as the correlation information. Furthermore; when constructing theclassification model; we adopt a pessimistic selection method for choosing amongalternative predictions. To make such prediction models useful; especially for small deviceswith limited memory and bandwidth; we also introduce a model compression method; whichremoves redundant association rules from the model.

Neighborhood randomization for link privacy in social network analysis,Amin Milani Fard; Ke Wang,Abstract Social network analysis has many important applications but it depends on sharingand publishing the underlying graph. Link privacy requires limiting the ability of an adversaryto infer the presence of a sensitive link between two individuals in the published socialnetwork graph. A standard technique for achieving link privacy is to probabilisticallyrandomize a link over the space for node pairs. A major drawback of such graph-wiserandomization is that it ignores the structural proximity of nodes; thus; alters considerably thestructure of social networks and distorts the accuracy of social network analysis. To addressthis problem; we propose a structure-aware randomization scheme; called neighborhoodrandomization. This scheme models a social network as a directed graph andprobabilistically randomizes the destination of a link within a local neighborhood. By …,World Wide Web,2015,12

Information propagation in microblog networks,Chenyi Zhang; Jianling Sun; Ke Wang,Abstract Information propagation in a microblog network aims to identify a set of seed usersfor propagating a target message to as many interested users as possible. This problemdiffers from the traditional influence maximization in two major ways: it has a content-richtarget message for propagation and it treats each link in the network as communication oncertain topics and emphasizes the topic relevance of such communication in propagatingthe target message. In realistic situations; however; the topics associated with a link are notexplicitly expressed but are hidden in the microblogs previously exchanged through the link.In this paper; we present a topic-aware solution to information propagation in a microblognetwork. We first model the latent topic structure of the network using observed microblogmessages published in the network.

Mining changing regions from access-constrained snapshots: a cluster-embedded decision tree approach,Irene Pekerskaya; Jian Pei; Ke Wang,Abstract Change detection on spatial data is important in many applications; such asenvironmental monitoring. Given a set of snapshots of spatial objects at various temporalinstants; a user may want to derive the changing regions between any two snapshots. Mostof the existing methods have to use at least one of the original data sets to detect changingregions. However; in some important applications; due to data access constraints such asprivacy concerns and limited data online availability; original data may not be available forchange analysis.

Selecting features by vertical compactness of data,Ke Wang; Suman Sundaresh,Abstract Feature selection is a data preprocessing step for classification and data miningtasks. Traditionally; feature selection is done by selecting fewest features that determine theclass label; ie; by the horizontal compactness of data. In this chapter 1; we propose a newselection criterion that aims at the vertical compactness of data. In particular; we select asubset of features that yields the fewest projected instances while determining the classlabel. Limitations of direct adoption of the standard depth-first search (DFS) and breath-firstsearch (BFS) are analyzed. A hybrid approach that is partially DFS and partially BFS isdescribed. To see the effectiveness of the new criterion on the classification task; wecompare the result induced by C4. 5 before and after the feature selection.,*,1998,12
Privacy-preserving data stream classification,Yabo Xu; Ke Wang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Rong She; Jian Pei,In a wide range of applications; multiple data streams need to be examined together in orderto discover trends or patterns existing across several data streams. One common practice isto redirect all data streams into a central place for joint analysis. This “centralized” practice ischallenged by the fact that data streams often are private in that they come from differentowners. In this paper; we focus on the problem of building a classifier in this context andassume that classification evolves as the current window of streams slides forward. Thisproblem faces two major challenges. First; the many-to-many join relationship of streams willblow up the already fast arrival rate of data streams. Second; the privacy requirement impliesthat data exchange among owners should be minimal. These considerations rule out allclassification methods that require producing the join in the current window. We show that …,*,2008,11
Pushing feature selection ahead of join,Rong She; Ke Wang; Yabo Xu; Philip S Yu,Abstract Current approaches for feature selection on multiple data sources need to join alldata in order to evaluate features against the class label; thus are not scalable and involveunnecessary information leakage. In this paper; we present a way of performing featureselection through class propagation; eliminating the need of join before feature selection.We propagate a very compact data structure that provides enough information for selectingfeatures to each data source; thus allowing features to be evaluated locally without lookingat any other information. Our experiments confirmed that our algorithm is highly scalablewhile effectively preserving the data privacy.,*,2005,11
Pushing aggregate constraints by divide-and-approximate,Ke Wang; Yuelong Jiang; Jeffrey Xu Yu; Guozhu Dong; Jiawei Han,Iceberg-cube mining is to compute the GROUP BY partitions; for all GROUP BY dimensionlists; that satisfy a given aggregate constraint. Previous works have pushed anti-monotoneconstraints into iceberg-cube mining. However; many useful constraints are not anti-monotone. We propose a novel strategy for pushing general aggregate constraints; calleddivide-and-approximate. This strategy divides the search space and approximates theconstraint in subspaces by a pushable constraint. As the strategy is recursively applied; theapproximation approaches the given constraint and the pruning tights up. We show that allconstraints defined by SQL aggregates; arithmetic operators and comparison operators canbe pushed by divide-and-approximate. We present an efficient implementation for animportant subclass and evaluate it on both synthetic and real life databases.,Data Engineering; 2003.

Data partition: a practical parallel evaluation of Datalog programs,Weining Zhang; Ke Wang; Siu-Cheung Chau,The authors analyse previous parallel evaluation strategies based on the partition of ruleinstantiations. They present a parallel evaluation strategy for general Datalog programs thatis based on the partition of data and is more practical. A key issue is to determine a criterionof data transmission that reduces the amount of data transmitted and is tested efficiently. Anotion of potential usefulness is given as such a criterion. The problem of designingappropriate partition schemes and processing schemes is addressed.

CubeExplorer: online exploration of data cubes,Jiawei Han; Jianyong Wang; Guozhu Dong; Jian Pei; Ke Wang,Abstract Data cube enables fast online analysis of large data repositories which is attractivein many applications. Although there are several kinds of available cube-based OLAPproducts; users may still encounter challenges on effectiveness and efficiency in theexploration of large data cubes due to the huge computation space as well as the hugeobservation space in a data cube. CubeExplorer is an integrated environment for onlineexploration of data cubes. It integrates our newly developed techniques on iceberg cubecomputation [2]; cube-based feature extraction; and gradient analysis [1]; and makes cubeexploration effective and efficient. In this demo; we will show the features of CubeExplorer;especially its power and flexibility at exploring and mining of large databases.,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2002,10

Anonymizing bag-valued sparse data by semantic similarity-based clustering,Junqiang Liu; Ke Wang,Abstract Web query logs provide a rich wealth of information; but also present seriousprivacy risks. We preserve privacy in publishing vocabularies extracted from a web query logby introducing vocabulary k-anonymity; which prevents the privacy attack of re-identificationthat reveals the real identities of vocabularies. A vocabulary is a bag of query-termsextracted from queries issued by a user at a specified granularity. Such bag-valued data areextremely sparse; which makes it hard to retain enough utility in enforcing k-anonymity. Tothe best of our knowledge; the prior works do not solve such a problem; among which someachieve a different privacy principle; for example; differential privacy; some deal with adifferent type of data; for example; set-valued data or relational data; and some consider adifferent publication scenario; for example; publishing frequent keywords.

Detecting data inconsistency for multidatabases,Ke Wang; Weining Zhang,Abstract Traditional approaches to database integration require that a common key exist inall participating relations that model equivalent entities in the real-world; therefore;compromising the logical heterogeneity of multidatabases. The recent proposal of usingknowledge to identify equivalent entities without requiring a common key gives rise to theissue of detecting potential inconsistency during entity identi cation. In this paper; criteria ofdata consistency are proposed and incremental tests in the process of updating data andknowledge are considered. The proposed framework and algorithms are tested by anexperiment on three databases extracted from the real-world.,The Ninth International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing Systems (PDCS’96),1996,9
Are Features Equally Representative? A Feature-Centric Recommendation.,Chenyi Zhang; Ke Wang; Ee-peng Lim; Qinneng Xu; Jianling Sun; Hongkun Yu,Abstract Typically a user prefers an item (eg; a movie) because she likes certain features ofthe item (eg; director; genre; producer). This observation motivates us to consider afeaturecentric recommendation approach to item recommendation: instead of directlypredicting the rating on items; we predict the rating on the features of items; and use suchratings to derive the rating on an item. This approach offers several advantages over thetraditional item-centric approach: it incorporates more information about why a user choosesan item; it generalizes better due to the denser feature rating data; it explains the predictionof item ratings through the predicted feature ratings. Another contribution is turning aprincipled item-centric solution into a feature-centric solution; instead of inventing a newalgorithm that is feature-centric. This approach maximally leverages previous research …,AAAI,2015,8
Parallel learning to rank for information retrieval,Shuaiqiang Wang; Byron J Gao; Ke Wang; Hady W Lauw,Abstract Learning to rank represents a category of effective ranking methods for informationretrieval.

A cooperative coevolution framework for parallel learning to rank,Shuaiqiang Wang; Yun Wu; Byron J Gao; Ke Wang; Hady W Lauw; Jun Ma,We propose CCRank; the first parallel framework for learning to rank based on evolutionaryalgorithms (EA); aiming to significantly improve learning efficiency while maintainingaccuracy. CCRank is based on cooperative coevolution (CC); a divide-and-conquerframework that has demonstrated high promise in function optimization for problems withlarge search space and complex structures. Moreover; CC naturally allows parallelization ofsub-solutions to the decomposed sub-problems; which can substantially boost learningefficiency. With CCRank; we investigate parallel CC in the context of learning to rank. Weimplement CCRank with three EA-based learning to rank algorithms for demonstration.Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets in comparison with the state-of-the-artalgorithms show the performance gains of CCRank in efficiency and accuracy.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,7

Fine-grain perturbation for privacy preserving data publishing,Rhonda Chaytor; Ke Wang; Patricia Brantingham,Recent work [12] shows that conventional privacy preserving publishing techniques basedon anonymity-groups are susceptible to corruption attacks. In a corruption attack; if thesensitive information of any anonymity-group member is uncovered; then the remaininggroup members are at risk. In this study; we abandon anonymity-groups and hide sensitiveinformation through perturbation on the sensitive attribute. With each record being perturbedindependently; corruption attacks cannot be effectively carried out. Previous anti-corruptionwork did not minimize information loss. This paper proposes to address this issue byallowing fine-grain privacy specification. We demonstrate the power of our approach throughexperiments on real medical and synthetic datasets.,Data Mining; 2009. ICDM'09. Ninth IEEE International Conference on,2009,7

Classification spanning correlated data streams,Yabo Xu; Ke Wang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Rong She; Jian Pei,Abstract In many applications; classifiers need to be built based on multiple related datastreams. For example; stock streams and news streams are related; where the classificationpatterns may involve features from both streams. Thus instead of mining on a single isolatedstream; we need to examine multiple related data streams in order to find such patterns andbuild an accurate classifier. Other examples of related streams include traffic reports and caraccidents; sensor readings of different types or at different locations; etc. In this paper; weconsider the classification problem defined over sliding-window join of several input datastreams. As the data streams arrive in fast pace and the many-to-many join relationshipblows up the data arrival rate even more; it is impractical to compute the join and then buildthe classifier each time the window slides forward.

Minimum splits based discretization for continuous features,Ke Wang; Han Chong Goh,Abstract Discretization refers to splitting the range of continuous values into intervals so as toprovide useful information about classes. This is usually done by minimizing a goodnessmeasure; subject to constraints such as the maximal number of intervals; the minimalnumber of examples per interval; or some stopping criterion for splitting. We take a differentapproach by searching for minimum splits that minimize the number of intervals with respectto a threshold of impurity (ie; badness). We propose a\total entropy" motivated selection ofthe\best" split from minimum splits; without requiring additional constraints. Experimentsshow that the proposed method produces better decision trees.,IJCAI (2),1997,7

P preserves IC if IC uniformlyimplies IC in P. We consider only definite DATALOG programs. We show that testingpreservation of downward-closed integrity constraints can be simplified to the case of single-rule programs that are computed in a “nonrecursive manner”. Specially; we present anefficient test algorithm when constraints are equality-generating dependencies. We alsoshow that the uniform implication problem can be similarly simplified if IC is preserved andall given constraints are downward-closed. Our results generalize dependency-preservingdatabase schemes by considering mappings defined by arbitrary definite DATALOG …,Information processing letters,1992,7

An effective clustering approach to web query log anonymization,Amin Milani Fard; Ke Wang,Web query log data contain information useful to research; however; release of such datacan re-identify the search engine users issuing the queries. These privacy concerns go farbeyond removing explicitly identifying information such as name and address; since non-identifying personal data can be combined with publicly available information to pinpoint toan individual. In this work we model web query logs as unstructured transaction data andpresent a novel transaction anonymization technique based on clustering andgeneralization techniques to achieve the k-anonymity privacy. We conduct extensiveexperiments on the AOL query log data. Our results show that this method results in a higherdata utility compared to the state-of-the-art transaction anonymization methods.,Security and Cryptography (SECRYPT); Proceedings of the 2010 International Conference on,2010,6

First-order logic characterization of program properties,Ke Wang; Li Yan Yuan,A program is first-order reducible (FO-reducible) wrt a set IC of integrity constraints if thereexists a first-order theory T such that the set of models for T is exactly the set of intendedmodels for the program wrt all possible EDBs. In this case; we say that P is FO-reducible to Twrt IC. For FO-reducible programs; it is possible to characterize; using first-order logicimplications; properties of programs that are related to all possible EDBs as in the databasecontext. These properties include; among others; containment of programs; independence ofupdates wrt queries and integrity constraints; and characterization and implication ofintegrity constraints in programs; all of which have no known proof procedures. Therefore;many important problems formalized in a nonstandard logic can be dealt with by using therich reservoir of first-order theorem-proving tools; provided that the program is FO …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,1994,6
Trip recommendation meets real-world constraints: POI availability; diversity; and traveling time uncertainty,Chenyi Zhang; Hongwei Liang; Ke Wang,Abstract As location-based social network (LBSN) services become increasingly popular;trip recommendation that recommends a sequence of points of interest (POIs) to visit for auser emerges as one of many important applications of LBSNs. Personalized triprecommendation tailors to users' specific tastes by learning from past check-in behaviors ofusers and their peers. Finding the optimal trip that maximizes user's experiences for a giventime budget constraint is an NP-hard problem and previous solutions do not consider threepractical and important constraints. One constraint is POI availability; where a POI may beonly available during a certain time window. Another constraint is uncertain traveling time;where the traveling time between two POIs is uncertain. In addition; the diversity of the POIsincluded in the trip plays an important role in user's final adoptions. This work presents …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2016,5
Reconstruction privacy: Enabling statistical learning,Ke Wang; Chao Han; Ada Waichee Fu; Raymond C WONG; Philip S Yu,Abstract Non-independent reasoning (NIR) allows the information about one record in thedata to be learnt from the information of other records in the data. Most posterior/prior basedprivacy criteria consider NIR as a privacy violation and require to smooth the distribution ofpublished data to avoid sensitive NIR. The drawback of this approach is that it limits theutility of learning statistical relationships. The differential privacy criterion considers NIR as anon-privacy violation; therefore; enables learning statistical relationships; but at the cost ofpotential disclosures through NIR. A question is whether it is possible to (1) allow learningstatistical relationships; yet (2) prevent sensitive NIR about an individual. We present a dataperturbation and sampling method to achieve both (1) and (2). The enabling mechanism is anew privacy criterion that distinguishes the two types of NIR in (1) and (2) with the help of …,*,2015,5

Building decision trees on records linked through key references,Ke Wang; Yabo Xu; Philip S Yu; Rong She,Abstract We consider the classification problem where the data is given by a collection oftables related by a hierarchical structure of key references and class labels contained in theroot table. Each parent table represents a many-to-many relationship type among its childtables. Such data are frequently found in relational databases; data warehouses; XML data;and biological databases. One solution is joining all tables into a universal table based onthe recorded relationships; but it suffers from a significant blowup caused by many-to-manyrelationships. Another solution is treating the problem as relational learning; at the cost ofincreased complexity and degraded performance. We propose a novel method that buildsexactly the same decision tree classifier as built from the joined table; but not the blowuprequired in the traditional approach.,*,2005,5

Microstructural Characterization of Thin Polyimide Films by Positron Lifetime Spectroscopy,A Eftekhari; AK St. Clair; DM Stoakley; Danny R Sprinkle; JJ Singh,Positron lifetimes have been measured in a series of thin aromatic polyimide films. Noevidence of positronium formation was observed in any of the films investigated. All test filmsexhibited only two positron lifetime components; the longer component corresponding to thepositrons annihilating at shallow traps. Based on these trapped positron lifetimes; freevolume fractions have been calculated for all the films tested. A free volume model has beendeveloped to calculate the dielectric constants of thin polyimide films. The experimental andthe calculated values for the dielectric constants of the films tested are in reasonably goodagreement. It has been further noted that the presence of bulky CF3 groups and metalinkages in the polyimide structure results in higher free volume fraction and; consequently;lower dielectric constant values for the films studied.,*,1994,5
On the boundedness of constant-time-maintainable database schemes,Héctor J Hernández; Ke Wang,Constant-time-maintainable database schemes are highly desirable with respect toconstraint enforcement; since it is possible to determine whether any of their consistentstates plus an inserted tuple is consistent in time independent of the state size. Severalproper subclasses of constant-time-maintainable database schemes are known to bebounded with respect to dependencies and hence very desirable with respect to queryanswering. However; whether the whole class of constant-time-maintainable databaseschemes is bounded is not known for sure. In this paper; it is proven that the entire class ofconstant-time-maintainable database schemes is bounded with respect to dependenciesand thus very desirable with respect to query answering in the following cases:(1) only cover-embedded functional dependencies appear as constraints;(2) only equality-generating …,SIAM Journal on Computing,1993,5
Small sum privacy and large sum utility in data publishing,Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Jia Wang; Minhao Jiang,Abstract While the study of privacy preserving data publishing has drawn a lot of interest;some recent work has shown that existing mechanisms do not limit all inferences aboutindividuals. This paper is a positive note in response to this finding. We point out that not allinference attacks should be countered; in contrast to all existing works known to us; andbased on this we propose a model called SPLU. This model protects sensitive information;by which we refer to answers for aggregate queries with small sums; while queries withlarge sums are answered with higher accuracy. Using SPLU; we introduce a sanitizationalgorithm to protect data while maintaining high data utility for queries with large sums.Empirical results show that our method behaves as desired.,Journal of biomedical informatics,2014,4
Small count privacy and large count utility in data publishing,Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jia Wang; Ke Wang; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract: While the introduction of differential privacy has been a major breakthrough in thestudy of privacy preserving data publication; some recent work has pointed out a number ofcases where it is not possible to limit inference about individuals. The dilemma that isintrinsic in the problem is the simultaneous requirement of data utility in the published data.Differential privacy does not aim to protect information about an individual that can beuncovered even without the participation of the individual. However; this lack of coveragemay violate the principle of individual privacy. Here we propose a solution by providingprotection to sensitive information; by which we refer to the answers for aggregate querieswith small counts. Previous works based on $\ell $-diversity can be seen as providing aspecial form of this kind of protection. Our method is developed with another goal which is …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1202.3253,2012,4
Probabilistic inference protection on anonymized data,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang; Yabo Xu; Jian Pei; S Yu Philip,Background knowledge is an important factor in privacy preserving data publishing.Probabilistic distribution-based background knowledge is a powerful kind of backgroundknowledge which is easily accessible to adversaries. However; to the best of our knowledge;there is no existing work that can provide a privacy guarantee under adversary attack withsuch background knowledge. The difficulty of the problem lies in the high complexity of theprobability computation and the non-monotone nature of the privacy condition. The onlysolution known to us relies on approximate algorithms with no known error bound. In thispaper; we propose a new bounding condition that overcomes the difficulties of the problemand gives a privacy guarantee.

Design of a compact polarization beam splitter based on a deformed photonic crystal directional coupler,Ren Gang; Zheng Wan-Hua; Wang Ke; Du Xiao-Yu; Xing Ming-Xin; Chen Liang-Hui,Abstract In this paper a compact polarization beam splitter based on a deformed photoniccrystal directional coupler is designed and simulated. The transverse-electric (TE) guidedmode and transverse-magnetic (TM) guided mode are split due to different guidingmechanisms. The effect of the shape deformation of the air holes on the coupler is studied. Itdiscovered that the coupling strength of the coupled waveguides is strongly enhanced byintroducing elliptical airholes; which reduce the device length to less than 18.5 μm. A finite-difference time-domain simulation is performed to evaluate the performance of the device;and the extinction ratios for both TE and TM polarized light are higher than 20 dB.,Chinese Physics B,2008,4

Mining is-part-of association patterns from semistructured data,Ke Wang; Huiqing Liu,Abstract One example of semistructured data sources is the World Wide Web (WWW). In thesemistructured world; the individual schema contained in each object has replaced theexternal schema of the data. An immediate implication on data mining is that it has to dealwith both data and schemas. This requires the data generalization to trace the role of objectsand handle structural irregularity; arbitrary nesting of ordered and unordered types; andcyclic object references. We introduce the framework of is-part-of association patterns toaddress the issue. We show applications of mining is-part-of association patterns in severaldisparate domains.,*,2001,4

Developing retinal biomarkers of neurological disease: an analytical perspective,Ian JC MacCormick; Gabriela Czanner; Brian Faragher,The inaccessibility of the brain poses a problem for neuroscience. Scientists havetraditionally responded by developing biomarkers for brain physiology and disease. Theretina is an attractive source of biomarkers since it shares many features with the brain.Some even describe the retina as a 'window'to the brain; implying that retinal signs areanalogous to brain disease features. However; new analytical methods are needed to showwhether or not retinal signs really are equivalent to brain abnormalities; since this requiresgreater evidence than direct associations between retina and brain. We; therefore propose anew way to think about; and test; how clearly one might see the brain through the retinalwindow; using cerebral malaria as a case study.,Biomarkers in medicine,2015,3
Sensitive disclosures under differential privacy guarantees,Chao Han; Ke Wang,Non-independent reasoning (NIR) refers to learning the information of one record from otherrecords; under the assumption that these records share the same underlying distribution.Accurate NIR could disclose private information of an individual. An important assumptionmade by differential privacy is that NIR is considered to be non-violation of privacy. In thiswork; we investigate the extent to which private information of an individual may bedisclosed through NIR by query answers that satisfy differential privacy. We first define whata disclosure means under NIR by randomized query answers. We then present a formalanalysis on such disclosures by differentially private query answers.

The properties of the equilibrium and the tendency of players' strategy are theresearch objective. In every period of the dynamic process; players update their strategy atthe same time. We study how the relationship between the cost of link formation and thepayoff influences the equilibrium structure and the absorbing set. The main contribution ofthe paper is combining the endogenous network with the strategic interaction on theendogenous infinite lattice. We also give the accurate characteristics of the equilibriumstructure and the absorbing set with different parameters.,运筹学学报,2012,3
genBlastG: extending BLAST to be a high performance gene finder,Rong She; J Shih-Chieh Chu; Bora Uyar; Jun Wang; Ke Wang; Nansheng Chen,ABSTRACT Motivation: BLAST users frequently expect to obtain homologous genes withcertain similarity to their query genes. But what they get from BLAST searches are oftencollections of local alignments called HSPs. On the other hand; most homology-based genefinders have been built using computation-intensive algorithms; without taking fulladvantage of BLAST searches that have been perfected over the last decades. Results:Here we report an efficient algorithm; genBlastG that directly uses the HSPs reported byBLAST to define high quality gene models.

Publishing skewed sensitive microdata,Yabo Xu; Ke Wang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract A highly skewed microdata contains some sensitive attribute values that occur farmore frequently than others. Such data violates the “eligibility condition” assumed byexisting works for limiting the probability of linking an individual to a specific sensitiveattribute value. Specifically; if the frequency of some sensitive attribute value is too high;publishing the sensitive attribute alone would lead to linking attacks. In many practicalscenarios; however; this eligibility condition is violated. In this paper; we consider how topublish microdata under this case. A natural solution is “minimally” suppressing“dominating” records to restore the eligibility condition. We show that the minimality ofsuppression may lead to linking attacks. To limit the inference probability; we propose arandomized suppression solution. We show that this approach has the least expected …,*,2010,3

Profit mining,Senqiang Zhou; Ke Wang,Abstract A major obstacle in data mining applications is the gap between the statistic-basedpattern extraction and the value-based decision-making.“Profit mining” aims to reduce thisgap. In profit mining; given a set of past transactions and pre-determined target items; welike to build a model for recommending target items and promotion strategies to newcustomers; with the goal of maximizing profit. Though this problem is studied in the context ofretailing environment; the concept and techniques are applicable to other applications undera general notion of “utility”. In this short article; we review existing techniques and brieflydescribe the profit mining approach recently proposed by the authors.

User-defined association mining,Ke Wang; Yu He,Abstract Discovering interesting associations of events is an important data mining task. Inmany real applications; the notion of association; which defines how events are associated;often depends on the particular application and user requirements. This motivates the needfor a general framework that allows the user to specify the notion of association of his/herown choices. In this paper we present such a framework; called the UDA mining (User-Defined Association Mining). The approach is to define a language for specifying a broadclass of associations and yet efficient to be implemented. We show that (1) existing notionsof association mining are instances of the UDA mining; and (2) many new ad-hocassociation mining tasks can be defined in the UDA mining framework.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2001,3

Generalized bucketization scheme for flexible privacy settings,Ke Wang; Peng Wang; Ada Waichee Fu; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract Bucketization is an anonymization technique for publishing sensitive data. The ideais to group records into small buckets to obscure the record-level association betweensensitive information and identifying information. Compared to the traditional generalizationtechnique; bucketization does not require a taxonomy of attribute values; so is applicable tomore data sets. A drawback of previous bucketization schemes is the uniform privacy settingand uniform bucket size; which often results in a non-achievable privacy goal or excessiveinformation loss if sensitive values have variable sensitivity. In this work; we present aflexible bucketization scheme to address these issues. In the flexible scheme; each sensitivevalue can have its own privacy setting and buckets of different sizes can be formed. Thechallenge is to determine proper bucket sizes and group sensitive values into buckets so …,Information Sciences,2016,2
Identifying PCB Contaminated Transformers Through Active Learning,Yin Chu Yeh; Wenyuan Li; Adriel Lau; Ke Wang,Exposure to polychlorinated biphenyals (PCBs) is hazardous to human health. The UnitedNations Environment Programme has decreed that nations; including Canada and USA;must eliminate PCB contaminated equipment such as transformers by 2025. To determinethe PCB status of a transformer with absolute certainty; the oil mixture of the transformermust be sampled because transformers labeled as non-PCB could be cross-contaminated.Since sealed oil mixture sampling is costly; for the first time; we apply an iterative machinelearning technique called active learning to classify PCB contaminated transformers whileminimizing a cost metric that integrates the classification error cost and the sampling cost.We propose a dynamic sampling method to address two key issues in active learning: thesampling size per iteration and the stopping criterion of the sampling process.

Computing join aggregates over private tables,Rong She; Ke Wang; Ada Waichee Fu; Yabo Xu,With explosive growth in data storage and networking; collaboration among various dataholders has become more and more important. Such collaboration frequently involvesmultiple private sources where free-access to private data is difficult or impossible due toprivacy concerns. Therefore; techniques that address the need of privacy-preservingcollaborative data analysis are critical (Clifton et al.; 2004). For example; a hospitalmaintains the medical histories of patients; denoted as table H; and a research institutemaintains the records of patients' DNA samples; denoted as R. Both tables contain theattribute “Patient_Name” that is not necessarily a key attribute if a patient has severaldiseases or DNA samples.

Computing join aggregates over private tables,Rong She; Ke Wang; Ada Waichee Fu; Yabo Xu,Abstract We propose a privacy-preserving protocol for computing aggregation queries overthe join of private tables. In this problem; several parties wish to share aggregatedinformation over the join of their tables; but want to conceal the details that generate suchinformation. The join operation presents a challenge to privacy preservation because itrequires matching individual records from private tables. We solve this problem by a novelsketching protocol that securely computes some randomized summary information overprivate tables. It ensures that during the query computation process; no party will learn otherparties' private data; including the individual records and data distributions. Previous workshave not provided this level of privacy for such queries.,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2007,2

Decomposition of magic rewriting,Ke Wang; Weining Zhang; Siu-Cheung Chau,Abstract The magic rewriting focuses on relevant data but suffers from additional rules;predicates; and tuples that are generated in search for the relevant data. Reducing the arityof predicates can cut down the number of such rules; predicates; and tuples by anexponential factor. In this paper; we consider a subclass of linear single-IDB programs andshow that the magic rewriting can be decomposed in such a way that it is applied to onlyprograms having smaller arities and fewer recursive rules; without losing the bindingcapacity. The decomposed rewriting is shown to be much more efficient than the standardone and amenable to distributed and parallel environments. The considered subclasssignificantly generalizes recursions previously proposed for efficient implementation.

On the equivalence of an Egd to a set of Fd's,Marc H Graham; Ke Wang,Abstract The question “Is a given join dependency equivalent to some set of multivalueddependencies?” led to the development of acyclicity theory [1]. The central question of thispaper is:“Is a given equality-generating dependency equivalent to a set of functionaldependencies?” An algorithm is presented that answers that question in polynomial timewithout using the chase process and; in the case of a “yes” answer; can be used to find (acover of) the set of functional dependencies involved. This question is also related to thesimilar question about join dependencies and multivalued dependencies by proving a resultabout the hypergraph representation of an egd. It is interesting to note that a minimalrepresentation of an egd must be &bgr;-acyclic for the egd to be equivalent to a set of fd's; incontrast to the jd/mvd case; in which only &agr;-acyclicity is needed.

Entity Set Expansion via Knowledge Graphs,Xiangling Zhang; Yueguo Chen; Jun Chen; Xiaoyong Du; Ke Wang; Ji-Rong Wen,Abstract The entity set expansion problem is to expand a small set of seed entities to a morecomplete set of similar entities. It can be applied in applications such as web search; itemrecommendation and query expansion. Traditionally; people solve this problem byexploiting the co-occurrence of entities within web pages; where latent semantic correlationamong seed entities cannot be revealed. We propose a novel approach to solve theproblem using knowledge graphs; by considering the deficiency (eg; incompleteness) ofknowledge graphs. We design an effective ranking model based on the semantic features ofseeds to retrieve the candidate entities. Extensive experiments on public datasets show thatthe proposed solution significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.,Proceedings of the 40th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,2017,1

While existing works focus onpatterns that follow from the well known homophily principle; we are interested in social tiesthat do not follow from homophily; thus; provide new insights. Finding top-k GRs faces newchallenges: it requires a novel ranking metric because traditional metrics favor patterns thatare expected from the homophily principle; it requires an innovative search strategy sincethere is no obvious anti-monotonicity for such GRs; it requires a novel data structure to avoiddata explosion caused by multidimensional nodes and edges and many-to-many …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,1

Therefore; we describe an optimal solution for bundle sizes up to two items; andpropose two heuristic solutions for bundles of any larger size.

Classification by CUT: Clearance Under Threshold,Ryan McBride; Ke Wang; Wenyuan Li,Identifying bad objects hidden amidst many good objects is important for public safety anddecision-making. These problems are complicated in that the cost of leaving a bad objectunidentified may not be specified easily; making it difficult to apply existing cost-sensitiveclassification that depends on knowing a cost matrix or cost distribution. A compelling casefor this" illusive cost" issue is presented in our project of identifying contaminatedtransformers with an industrial partner. To address this problem; we present an alternativeformulation of cost-sensitive classification; Clearance Under Threshold (CUT) Classification.Given a training set; CUT classification is to partition the attribute space such that a partitionis cleared if the probability of a future object in this partition being bad is less than a user-specified threshold. The goal is to clear many low-risk objects so that users can more …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2014 IEEE International Conference on,2014,1

In this paper; we present a novelgene prediction method that is both fast and accurate; by making use of protein homologyand decision tree classification. Specifically; we apply the principled entropy and decisiontree concepts to assist in such gene prediction process.

Preserving Individual Privacy in Serial Data Publishing,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jia Liu; Ke Wang; Yabo Xu,Abstract: While previous works on privacy-preserving serial data publishing consider thescenario where sensitive values may persist over multiple data releases; we find that noprevious work has sufficient protection provided for sensitive values that can change overtime; which should be the more common case. In this work we propose to study the privacyguarantee for such transient sensitive values; which we call the global guarantee. Weformally define the problem for achieving this guarantee and derive some theoreticalproperties for this problem.

Personalized Top-N Sequential Recommendation via Convolutional Sequence Embedding,Jiaxi Tang; Ke Wang,ABSTRACT Top-N sequential recommendation models each user as a sequence of itemsinteracted in the past and aims to predict top-N ranked items that a user will likely interact ina “near future”. The order of interaction implies that sequential patterns play an importantrole where more recent items in a sequence have a larger impact on the next item. In thispaper; we propose a Convolutional Sequence Embedding Recommendation Model (Caser)as a solution to address this requirement. The idea is to embed a sequence of recent itemsinto an “image” in the time and latent spaces and learn sequential patterns as local featuresof the image using convolutional lters. This approach provides a uni ed and exible networkstructure for capturing both general preferences and sequential patterns.

One challenge is dealing with thepersonalized diversity requirement where each user has a different trade-off betweenquantity (the number of POIs with a specified feature) and variety (the coverage of specifiedfeatures). Another challenge is the large scale of the POI network and the great manyalternative routes to search.

Risk Clearance with Guaranteed Precision,Ryan McBride; Ke Wang; Viswanadh Nekkanti; Wenyuan Li,Abstract In real life applications; we often face the following risk clearance problem: given aset of instances with a known numeric outcome Y (eg; a toxicity level); we want to learn amodel to identify new instances that have a low risk; ie; the probability of the Y valueexceeding a certain maximum MAX is less than some threshold t. This problem guaranteesthat the cleared instances have the minimum precision of 1–t for Y≤ MAX. By clearing suchlow risk instances; we can allocate costly resources to the remaining high risk instances. Inthis work; we formulate this problem as Risk Clearance with a goal of maximizing theclearance of low risk instances. Existing classification models fail to solve Risk Clearanceadequately; so we develop algorithms designed specifically for this problem. We thenvalidate that our approach improves on existing work via experiments on an industrial …,*,2017,*
Revisiting Security Risks of Asymmetric Scalar Product Preserving Encryption and Its Variants,Weipeng Lin; Ke Wang; Zhilin Zhang; Hong Chen,Cloud computing has emerged as a compelling vision for managing data and deliveringquery answering capability over the internet. This new way of computing also poses a realrisk of disclosing confidential information to the cloud. Searchable encryption addresses thisissue by allowing the cloud to compute the answer to a query based on the cipher texts ofdata and queries. Thanks to its inner product preservation property; the asymmetric scalar-product-preserving encryption (ASPE) has been adopted and enhanced in a growingnumber of works toperform a variety of queries and tasks in the cloud computingsetting.However; the security property of ASPE and its enhancedschemes has not been studiedcarefully. In this paper; we show acomplete disclosure of ASPE and several previouslyunknownsecurity risks of its enhanced schemes.

Wheat chromosome substitution lines between twovarieties have been widely used for locating genes because of their distinctive advantagesin genetic analysis; compared with the aneuploid genetic materials. Apart from thesubstituted chromosome; the other chromosomes between the substitution lines and theirrecipient parent should be identical; which eases the gene locating practice.

Modelling cascades over time in microblogs,Wei Xie; Feida Zhu; Siyuan Liu; Ke Wang,One of the most important features of microblogging services such as Twitter is how easy it isto re-share a piece of information across the network through various user connections;forming what we call a" cascade". Business applications such as viral marketing have drivena tremendous amount of research effort predicting whether a certain cascade will go viral.Yet the rarity of viral cascades in real data poses a challenge to all existing predictionmethods. One solution is to simulate cascades that well fit the real viral ones; which requiresour ability to tell how a certain cascade grows over time. In this paper; we build a generaltime-aware cascade model for each particular cascade; in which the chance of one user's re-sharing behaviour over time is modelled as a hazard function of time. Based on two keyobservations on user retweeting behaviour; we design an appropriate hazard function …,Big Data (Big Data); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,*

Latent Tunnel Based Information Propagation in Microblog Networks,Chenyi Zhang; Jianling Sun; Ke Wang,Abstract Information propagation in a microblog network aims to identify a set of seed usersfor propagating a target message to as many interested users as possible. This problemdiffers from the traditional influence maximization in two major ways: it has a content-richtarget message for propagation and it treats each link in the network as communication oncertain topics and emphasizes the topic relevance of such communication in propagatingthe target message. In realistic situations; however; the topics associated with a link are notexplicitly expressed but are hidden in the microblogs previously exchanged through the link.In this paper; we present a topic-aware solution to information propagation in a microblognetwork. We first model the latent topic structure of the network using observed microblogmessages published in the network. We then present two methods for estimating the …,*,2014,*
Inferential or Differential: Privacy Laws Dictate,Ke Wang; Peng Wang; Ada Waichee Fu; Raywong Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract: So far; privacy models follow two paradigms. The first paradigm; termed inferentialprivacy in this paper; focuses on the risk due to statistical inference of sensitive informationabout a target record from other records in the database. The second paradigm; known asdifferential privacy; focuses on the risk to an individual when included in; versus when notincluded in; the database. The contribution of this paper consists of two parts. The first partpresents a critical analysis on differential privacy with two results:(i) the differential privacymechanism does not provide inferential privacy;(ii) the impossibility result about achievingDalenius's privacy goal [5] is based on an adversary simulated by a Turing machine; but ahuman adversary may behave differently; consequently; the practical implication of theimpossibility result remains unclear.

Investigation on the Light-Driven Formation Mechanism and Photocatalytic Properties of a Porous Amorphous Titanium Dioxide,CHEN Wei1 WEI Xiao; WANG Jian-Qiang2 WANG Kai-Xue; CHEN Jie-Sheng,A porous amorphous TiO2 has been prepared through a light-driven formation process.Titanium glycolate (TG) synthesized through the solvothermal reaction between titanium (IV)n-butoxide and ethylene glycol is used as a precursor. The irradiation of TG under UV lightleads to the formation of the porous amorphous TiO2. The sample is characterized bypowder X-ray diffraction (XRD); scanning electron microscopy (SEM); transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM) and N2 adsorption/desorption. The results of these characterizationsreveal the porous and amorphous nature of the sample. The transformation mechanism fromTG to amorphous TiO2 under UV light is investigated by X-ray absorption fine structure(XAFS) spectroscopy.

Some Suggestion on Gasoline Conservation Management Policy-An Empirical Analysis Using Cointegration and Error-Correct Model Techniques,Xiaowie Wang; Wang Ke; Zou Ji; Dongyu Wang,It is of great significance to study gasoline conservation management policies for that thedemand for gasoline continually grow rapidly and the high dependence on oil imports inChina. In this paper; the relationship between gasoline consumption; national income andprice of gasoline is empirically examined using cointegration and error correctiontechniques. And with a comparative analysis; this paper gets conclusions as follows: A one-size-fits-all national management policy is not appropriate for the purpose of gasolineconservation; and the gasoline conservation management policy should pay more attentionto its long-term effects. The management policy of increasing the price of gasoline (such asfuel tax; etc.) is very limited in reducing gasoline consumption; and is not highlyrecommended in most of the provinces.

Distribution-based background knowledge is one of the well studied backgroundknowledge. However; to the best of our knowledge; there is no existing work considering thedistribution-based background knowledge in the worst case scenario; by which we meanthat the adversary has accurate knowledge about the distribution of sensitive valuesaccording to some tuple attributes. Considering this worst case scenario is essentialbecause we cannot overlook any breaching possibility. In this paper; we propose analgorithm to anonymize dataset in order to protect individual privacy by considering thisbackground knowledge. We prove that the anonymized datasets generated by our proposedalgorithm protects individual privacy. Our empirical studies show that our method …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0909.1127,2009,*

Near-neighbor search in pattern distance spaces,Haixun Wang; Chang-Shing Perng; Philip S Yu,Abstract In this paper; we study the near-neighbor problem based on pattern similarity; anew type of similarity which conventional distance metrics such as Lp norm cannot modeleffectively. The problem; however; is important to many applications. For example; in DNAmicroarray analysis; the expression levels of two closely related genes may rise and fallunder different external conditions or at different time. Although the magnitude of theirexpression levels may not be close; the patterns they exhibit over the time or under differentconditions can be very similar. In this paper; we measure the distance between two objectsby pattern similarity; ie; whether the two objects exhibit a synchronous pattern of rise and fallunder different conditions. We then present an efficient algorithm for near-neighbor searchbased on pattern similarity; and we perform tests on several real and synthetic data sets …,*,2005,*

A partial pre-computation of aggregates for MOLAP databasecby Chao Li.,Chao Li,ABSTRACT Partial pre-computation for OLAP (On-Line Analytic Processing) databases hasbeen a popular research topic in recent years. Obviously; a partial pre-computation schemeshould be chosen such that the answering time of a particular query workload is optimised.The query workload of an OLAP application is the set of queries users expect. Most of thepapers published only deal with the optimisation for the workload of views within the contextof ROLAP (Relational OLAP). The partial pre-computation schemes optimised for viewshave been criticized for lack of support to ad-hoc querying and that a view may be too largea unit for pre-computation for queries that fetch very small answers. In this thesis; we studythe problem of partial pre-computation for the workload of point queries; which is suited forMOLAP (Multidimensional OLAP) systems.

More importantly;we propose novel methods to build tree-based pseudo projections and array-basedunfiltered projections for projected transaction subsets; which makes our algorithm bothCPU time efficient and memory saving.

Weakly independent database schemes,Ke Wang; Weining Zhang; Siu-Cheung Chau,Abstract. Independent database schemes are best known to have constraints enforcedglobally by enforcing them locally in individual relations; and therefore are highly desirablein an updates-busy and distributed environment. However; independence excludes alldatabase schemes with interrelational functional dependencies and therefore is too strong acondition. In this paper; a natural generalization of independent schemes along this line;called weakly independent schemes; is defined. A database scheme is weakly independentwith respect to a set of embedded functional dependencies if the constraints can beenforced globally by enforcing local as well as interrelational functional dependencies.(a) Acharacterization of the weak independence and an exponential time test (in the number offunctional dependencies) are presented.(b) Two polynomial time conditions are also …,Acta Informatica,1997,*

According to patients' prognosis; two groups were divided. Group 1 was patientswith sudden cardiac death (SCD) or heart failure (HF)(n= 20). Group 2; patients without anycardiac events (n= 69). These patients were paired with the age and sex (ratio: 1: 2). 17factors which may affect the long-term prognosis of AMI were analyzed. results showed: 1.The incidence of SCD was 2.2%. 2. Excluding the age and sex factor; the lateral wallejection fraction of left ventricle (LAT-EF) and the level of serum CK-MB were twoindependent main effective risk factors of the long-term prognosis of AMI. 3.

Indexed Step-Wise Semi-Naive Evaluation for Recursive Queries,Ke Wang; Weining Zhang,Abstract A nice property of the semi-naive evaluation of recursive rules is that it does notrepeat rule rings in di erent iterations. In a recent study W]; however; it was observed thatintermediate steps during a rule ring may be repeated in di erent iterations; and a notion ofthe step-wise semi-naive property and an evaluation with this property were proposed tocapture the semi-naive property at intermediate steps of a rule ring. In this paper; we furtherextend the semi-naive notion to the build-up of index for computing relations that growmonotonically in each iteration. Hash tables are chosen as the index in this study; but theidea can be applied to other types of index in general. A modication of the step-wise semi-naive evaluation based on the semi-naive build-up of hash tables is proposed.

On characterizing boundedness of database schemes with bounded dependencies,Ke Wang,Abstract We investigate the effect of bounded dependencies on the boundedness ofdatabase schemes. The following results are proved. A database scheme with only boundedequality-generating dependencies is always bounded with respect to dependencies; alossless database scheme with bounded full implicational dependencies is bounded wrtdependencies if and only if the implicational dependencies are equivalent to a single joindependency and some equality-generating dependencies. By a known method; thiscondition can be tested effectively. These results are relevant in database theory in that theydetermine in a rather general case whether queries under the representative instanceapproach can be expressed in relational algebra.,Theoretical computer science,1992,*

The classes of expansion-chased schemes and simple chase join boundedschemes are aimed at capturing the behaviour of the chase process by a static structure; ie;derivation sequences of relation schemes. We first present a study on containmentrelationships among various classes of database schemes; which establishes the generalityand desirability of these new classes. We then show that the new classes and the class ofalgebraic-maintainable schemes can be incrementally designed via a known schemegenerating method.,International Conference on Computing and Information,1991,*

Proc SIGMOD'01.,Jiawei Han; Jian Pei; Guozhu Dong; Ke Wang,It is often too expensive to compute and materialize a complete high-dimensional data cube.Computing an iceberg cube is an effective way to derive nontrivial multi-dimensionalaggregations for OLAP; data mining; data compression; and other applications. An icebergcube is the set of all cells in a data cube that satisfy certain constraints; such as a minimumsupport threshold. Previous studies developed some efficient methods for computingiceberg cubes for simple measures; such as count and sum of nonnegative values.However; it is still a challenging problem to efficiently compute iceberg cubes with complexmeasures; such as average; sum of mixture of nonnegative and negative values; etc. In thispaper; we study efficient methods for computing iceberg cubes with some popularly usedcomplex measures and develop a methodology that uses a weaker but anti-monotonic …,*,*,*
Ultra-Deep Fractured Tight Sandstone Gas Reservoirs: Characteristics and Quantitative Evaluation of Fractures in the Lower Cretaceous; Keshen Gas Field Tarim B...,Junpeng Wang; R Zhang; H Zhang,Abstract The Tarim Basin is a significant petroliferous basin in the west of China. The LowerCretaceous Bashijiqike Formation; whose buried depth exceeds 7000m and has a lowmatrix porosity (< 10%) and permeability (< 0.05 mD); is the main gas producing interval inKeshen Gas Field of Tarim Basin. Structural fractures can improve reservoir permeabilityeffectively. CT scanning results; analysis on FMI and pressure experiments indicate thatalthough the fractures in tight sandstone can only cause low porosity (< 0.1%); however theycan improve permeability largely (to 10∼ 100 times). Meantime micro fractures can improvepore throat configuration. According to the CLSM (Confocal laser scanning microscope) andSTM (Scanning tunnel microscopy); there are three types of configuration between microfractures and matrix pore throats; which are controlled by fracture development stage and …,AAPG/SEG International Conference & Exhibition,*,*
Scientific Session,James J Morrison; John Kaufman,Background: Central venous access is an important tool in the treatment of critically illpatients. In the United States; over 15 million catheter days/year are recorded in theintensive care unit alone.(1) Placement of central venous catheters (CVCs) is a basic skill fornearly every medical specialty. However; central venous lines are not without risk.Complication rates during catheter placement are reported between 15-33%.(2; 3) Evenafter successful placement; having an indwelling CVC puts patients at risk for catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI). Each year in the United States; central venouscatheters cause an estimated 80;000 CRBSI in ICUs.(4) A total of 250;000 cases of bloodstream infections have been estimated to occur annually if entire hospitals are assessedand; as a result; up to 62;000 deaths among patients in hospitals.(5),*,*,*

Constructing Compact Sequential Classifiers using Web-Log Mining,Qiang Yang; T Ian Li; Ke Wang,Abstract. With millions of web users visiting web servers each day; the web logs containsvaluable information about users' browsing behavior. In this work; we construct sequentialclassifiers for predicting the users' next visits based on the current actions using associationrule mining. The domain feature of web log mining entails that we adopt a special kind ofassociation rules we call latest-substring rules; which takes into account the temporalinformation as well as the correlation information. Furthermore; when constructing theclassification model; we adopt a pessimistic selection method for choosing amongalternative predictions. To make such prediction models useful especially for small deviceswith limited memory and bandwidth; we also introduce a model compression method; whichremoves redundant association rules from the model. We empirically show that the …,*,*,*
Minimality Attack in Privacy Preserving Data Publishing Technical Report TR 2006-28,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang; Jian Pei,Abstract Data publishing generates much concern over the protection of individual privacy.In the well-known kanonymity model and the related models such as l-diversity and (α; k)-anonymity; the adversary is assumed to possess knowledge about an external table withinformation of the quasi-identifiers of individuals. In this paper; we show that knowledge ofthe mechanism or algorithm of anonymization for data publication can also lead to extrainformation that assists the adversary and jeopardizes individual privacy. In particular; allknown mechanisms try to minimize information loss and such an attempt provides for aloophole for attacks. We call such an attack a minimality attack. In this paper; we propose amodel called mconfidentiality which deals with the individual privacy issue with theconsideration of minimality attacks. Though the problem of optimal m-confidentiality …,*,*,*
Privacy-Preserving Classification for Data Streams,Yabo Xu; Ke Wang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Rong She; Jian Pei,ABSTRACT In a wide range of applications; multiple data streams need to be examinedtogether in order to discover trends or patterns existing across several data streams. Onecommon practice is to redirect all data streams into a central place for joint analysis. This“centralized” practice is challenged by the fact that data streams often are private in that theycome from different owners. In this paper; we focus on the problem of building a classifier inthis context and assume that classification evolves as the current window of streams slidesforward. This problem faces two major challenges. First; the many-to-many join relationshipof streams will blow up the already fast arrival rate of data streams. Second; the privacyrequirement implies that data exchange among owners should be minimal. Theseconsiderations rule out all classification methods that require producing the join in the …,*,*,*
User-De ned Association Mining,Ke Wang; Yu He,Abstract. Discovering interesting associations of events is an important data mining task. Inmany real applications; the notion of association; which de nes how events are associated;often depends on the particular application and user requirements. This motivates the needfor a general framework that allows the user to specify the notion of association of his/herown choices. In this paper we present such a framework; called the UDA mining (User-Dened Association Mining). The approach is to de ne a language for specifying a broad classof associations and yet e cient to be implemented. We show that (1) existing notions ofassociation mining are instances of the UDA mining; and (2) many new ad-hoc associationmining tasks can be de ned in the UDA mining framework.,*,*,*
Trend Based Periodicity Detection for Load Curve Data,Ke Wang,Abstract—The authors propose a novel periodicity detection for load curve data that is trendbased; therefore; noise resilient. This method models key information in load curve data by asequence of peaks and valleys extracted from a smoothing curve; and extends DynamicTime Warping technique to discover repeating subsequences of such shapes while allowingvariations due to background noises. Our experimental results show that it is able to detectperiodicities more accurately than existing algorithms.,*,*,*

QUICK-A Graphical User Interface to Genome Multidatabases,Wang Chiew Tan; Ke Wang; Limsoon Wong; Heng Mui Keng Terrace,Abstract Formulating queries to access multiple databases can be a formidable task;especially when many terms from various databases and complex constraints are involved.To specify a multidatabase query; the user usually has to search through documents forexact database terms and learn the multidatabase language. This report presents QUICK(QUery Interface to CPL-Kleisli); a graphical user interface to multiple databases. CPL(Collection Programming Language) is a high-level multidatabase language built on top ofan open query system Kleisli. QUICK allows users to handle overwhelming information fromdifferent data sources in an intuitive and uniform manner. The query specification is reducedto specifying user's terms in his/her own world; selecting paths and specifying constraints ina graph. Through the terms entered by the user; QUICK is able to reduce the scope of the …,*,*,*
