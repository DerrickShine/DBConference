View selection in semantic web databases,François Goasdoué; Konstantinos Karanasos; Julien Leblay; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract We consider the setting of a Semantic Web database; containing both explicit dataencoded in RDF triples; and implicit data; implied by the RDF semantics. Based on a queryworkload; we address the problem of selecting a set of views to be materialized in thedatabase; minimizing a combination of query processing; view storage; and viewmaintenance costs. Starting from an existing relational view selection method; we devisenew algorithms for recommending view sets; and show that they scale significantly beyondthe existing relational ones when adapted to the RDF context. To account for implicit triplesin query answers; we propose a novel RDF query reformulation algorithm and an innovativeway of incorporating it into view selection in order to avoid a combinatorial explosion in thecomplexity of the selection process. The interest of our techniques is demonstrated …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,88
Wanalytics: Geo-distributed analytics for a data intensive world,Ashish Vulimiri; Carlo Curino; Philip Brighten Godfrey; Thomas Jungblut; Konstantinos Karanasos; Jitendra Padhye; George Varghese,Abstract Many large organizations collect massive volumes of data each day in ageographically distributed fashion; at data centers around the globe. Despite theirgeographically diverse origin the data must be processed and analyzed as a whole toextract insight. We call the problem of supporting large-scale geo-distributed analytics Wide-Area Big Data (WABD). To the best of our knowledge; WABD is currently addressed bycopying all the data to a central data center where the analytics are run. This approachconsumes expensive cross-data center bandwidth and is incompatible with data sovereigntyrestrictions that are starting to take shape. We instead propose WANalytics; a system thatsolves the WABD problem by orchestrating distributed query execution and adjusting datareplication across data centers in order to minimize bandwidth usage; while respecting …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD international conference on management of data,2015,54
Mercury: Hybrid Centralized and Distributed Scheduling in Large Shared Clusters.,Konstantinos Karanasos; Sriram Rao; Carlo Curino; Chris Douglas; Kishore Chaliparambil; Giovanni Matteo Fumarola; Solom Heddaya; Raghu Ramakrishnan; Sarvesh Sakalanaga,Abstract Datacenter-scale computing for analytics workloads is increasingly common. Highoperational costs force heterogeneous applications to share cluster resources for achievingeconomy of scale. Scheduling such large and diverse workloads is inherently hard; andexisting approaches tackle this in two alternative ways: 1) centralized solutions offer strict;secure enforcement of scheduling invariants (eg; fairness; capacity) for heterogeneousapplications; 2) distributed solutions offer scalable; efficient scheduling for homogeneousapplications. We argue that these solutions are complementary; and advocate a blendedapproach. Concretely; we propose,USENIX Annual Technical Conference,2015,43
Efficient XQuery rewriting using multiple views,Ioana Manolescu; Konstantinos Karanasos; Vasilis Vassalos; Spyros Zoupanos,We consider the problem of rewriting XQuery queries using multiple materialized XQueryviews. The XQuery dialect we use to express views and queries corresponds to tree patterns(returning data from several nodes; at different granularities; ranging from node identifiers tofull XML subtrees) with value joins. We provide correct and complete algorithms for findingminimal rewritings; in which no view is redundant. Our work extends the state of the art byconsidering more flexible views than the mostly XPath 1.0 dialects previously considered;and more powerful rewritings. We implemented our algorithms and assess theirperformance through a set of experiments.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,34
Efficient queue management for cluster scheduling,Jeff Rasley; Konstantinos Karanasos; Srikanth Kandula; Rodrigo Fonseca; Milan Vojnovic; Sriram Rao,Abstract Job scheduling in Big Data clusters is crucial both for cluster operators' return oninvestment and for overall user experience. In this context; we observe several anomalies inhow modern cluster schedulers manage queues; and argue that maintaining queues oftasks at worker nodes has significant benefits. On one hand; centralized approaches do notuse worker-side queues. Given the inherent feedback delays that these systems incur; theyachieve suboptimal cluster utilization; particularly for workloads dominated by short tasks.On the other hand; distributed schedulers typically do employ worker-side queuing; andachieve higher cluster utilization. However; they fail to place tasks at the best possiblemachine; since they lack cluster-wide information; leading to worse job completion time;especially for heterogeneous workloads. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first …,Proceedings of the Eleventh European Conference on Computer Systems,2016,27
Growing triples on trees: an XML-RDF hybrid model for annotated documents,François Goasdoué; Konstantinos Karanasos; Yannis Katsis; Julien Leblay; Ioana Manolescu; Stamatis Zampetakis,Abstract Since the beginning of the Semantic Web initiative; significant efforts have beeninvested in finding efficient ways to publish; store; and query metadata on the Web. RDF andSPARQL have become the standard data model and query language; respectively; todescribe resources on the Web. Large amounts of RDF data are now available either asstand-alone datasets or as metadata over semi-structured (typically XML) documents. Theability to apply RDF annotations over XML data emphasizes the need to represent andquery data and metadata simultaneously. We propose XR; a novel hybrid data modelcapturing the structural aspects of XML data and the semantics of RDF; also enabling us toreason about XML data. Our model is general enough to describe pure XML or RDFdatasets; as well as RDF-annotated XML data; where any XML node can act as a …,The VLDB Journal,2013,20

Dynamically optimizing queries over large scale data platforms,Konstantinos Karanasos; Andrey Balmin; Marcel Kutsch; Fatma Ozcan; Vuk Ercegovac; Chunyang Xia; Jesse Jackson,Abstract Enterprises are adapting large-scale data processing platforms; such as Hadoop; togain actionable insights from their" big data". Query optimization is still an open challenge inthis environment due to the volume and heterogeneity of data; comprising both structuredand un/semi-structured datasets. Moreover; it has become common practice to pushbusiness logic close to the data via user-defined functions (UDFs); which are usuallyopaque to the optimizer; further complicating cost-based optimization. As a result; classicalrelational query optimization techniques do not fit well in this setting; while at the same time;suboptimal query plans can be disastrous with large datasets. In this paper; we propose newtechniques that take into account UDFs and correlations between relations for optimizingqueries running on large scale clusters. We introduce" pilot runs"; which execute part of …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,12
Delta: Scalable data dissemination under capacity constraints,Konstantinos Karanasos; Asterios Katsifodimos; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract In content-based publish-subscribe (pub/sub) systems; users express their interestsas queries over a stream of publications. Scaling up content-based pub/sub to very largenumbers of subscriptions is challenging: users are interested in low latency; that is; gettingsubscription results fast; while the pub/sub system provider is mostly interested in scaling; ie;being able to serve large numbers of subscribers; with low computational resourcesutilization. We present a novel approach for scalable content-based pub/sub in the presenceof constraints on the available CPU and network resources; implemented within our pub/subsystem Delta. We achieve scalability by off-loading some subscriptions from the pub/subserver; and leveraging view-based query rewriting to feed these subscriptions from the dataaccumulated in others. Our main contribution is a novel algorithm for organizing views in …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,12

Materialized view-based processing of RDF queries,François Goasdoué; Konstantinos Karanasos; Julien Leblay; Ioana Manolescu,The increasing interest in the RDF data model has turned the efficient processing of queriesover RDF datasets to a challenging and crucial task. Indeed; the triple format of the RDFdata model; along with the lack of structure that characterizes it; raise new challenges indata management both in terms of performance and scalability. In this paper; we considerimproving the performance of RDF query evaluation by using materialized views. Startingfrom a workload of queries; we describe the space of possible views to materialize; weintroduce ways for assessing the optimality of each view set and we propose practicalalgorithms for exploring the search space. When an RDF Schema is available; our algorithmtakes advantage of it to guarantee the completeness of answering queries. We evaluate theefficiency of our search algorithms and demonstrate the benefits of the materialized views …,Bases de Données Avancées,2010,7
View-based techniques for the efficient management of web data,Konstantinos Karanasos,Data is being published in digital formats at very high rates nowadays. A large share of thisdata has complex structure; typically organized as trees (Web documents such as HTML andXML being the most representative) or graphs (in particular; graph-structured Semantic Webdatabases; expressed in RDF). There is great interest in exploiting such complex data;whether in an Open Data access model or within companies owning it; and efficiently doingso for large data volumes remains challenging. Materialized views have long been used toobtain significant performance improvements when processing queries. The principle is thata view stores pre-computed results that can be used to evaluate (possibly part of) a query.Adapting materialized view techniques to the Web data setting we consider is particularlychallenging due to the structural and semantic complexity of the data.

Des triplets sur des arbres: un modele hybride XML-RDF pour documents annotés,François Goasdoué; Konstantinos Karanasos; Yannis Katsis; Julien Leblay; Ioana Manolescu; Stamatis Zampetakis,Une énergie considérable est consacrée à l'enrichissement sémantique de données XMLdu web via des annotations. Celles-ci vont de simples métadonnées jusqu'à des relationssémantiques complexes entre données. Bien que l'idée d'utiliser des annotations soit deplus en plus largement partagée; il reste à définir l'architecture qui permettra de la mettre enœuvre. Dans cet but; nous présentons un framework permettant le stockage et l'interrogationde documents annotés. Nous introduisons (i) le modèle de données XR; dans lequel lesdocuments annotés sont des documents XML décrits sémantiquement par des triplets RDF;et (ii) le langage de requêtes XRQ permettant d'interroger les documents annotés par leurstructure et leur sémantique.

Dynamic query optimization with pilot runs,*,Abstract In one embodiment; a computer-implemented method includes selecting one ormore sub-expressions of a query during compile time. One or more pilot runs are performedby one or more computer processors. The one or more pilot runs include a pilot runassociated with each of one or more of the selected sub-expressions; and each pilot runincludes at least partial execution of the associated selected sub-expression. The pilot runsare performed during execution time. Statistics are collected on the one or more pilot runsduring performance of the one or more pilot runs. The query is optimized based at least inpart on the statistics collected during the one or more pilot runs; where the optimizationincludes basing cardinality and cost estimates on the statistics collected during the pilotruns.,*,2017,*
