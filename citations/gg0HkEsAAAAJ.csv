Evaluating clustering in subspace projections of high dimensional data,Emmanuel Müller; Stephan Günnemann; Ira Assent; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Clustering high dimensional data is an emerging research field. Subspaceclustering or projected clustering group similar objects in subspaces; ie projections; of thefull space. In the past decade; several clustering paradigms have been developed inparallel; without thorough evaluation and comparison between these paradigms on acommon basis. Conclusive evaluation and comparison is challenged by three major issues.First; there is no ground truth that describes the" true" clusters in real world data. Second; alarge variety of evaluation measures have been used that reflect different aspects of theclustering result. Finally; in typical publications authors have limited their analysis to theirfavored paradigm only; while paying other paradigms little or no attention.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,230
HiCS: high contrast subspaces for density-based outlier ranking,Fabian Keller; Emmanuel Muller; Klemens Bohm,Outlier mining is a major task in data analysis. Outliers are objects that highly deviate fromregular objects in their local neighborhood. Density-based outlier ranking methods scoreeach object based on its degree of deviation. In many applications; these ranking methodsdegenerate to random listings due to low contrast between outliers and regular objects.Outliers do not show up in the scattered full space; they are hidden in multiple high contrastsubspace projections of the data. Measuring the contrast of such subspaces for outlierrankings is an open research challenge. In this work; we propose a novel subspace searchmethod that selects high contrast subspaces for density-based outlier ranking. It is designedas pre-processing step to outlier ranking algorithms. It searches for high contrast subspaceswith a significant amount of conditional dependence among the subspace dimensions …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,137
DUSC: Dimensionality unbiased subspace clustering,Ira Assent; Ralph Krieger; Emmanuel Müller; Thomas Seidl,To gain insight into today's large data resources; data mining provides automaticaggregation techniques. Clustering aims at grouping data such that objects within groupsare similar while objects in different groups are dissimilar. In scenarios with many attributesor with noise; clusters are often hidden in subspaces of the data and do not show up in thefull dimensional space. For these applications; subspace clustering methods aim atdetecting clusters in any sub-space. Existing subspace clustering approaches fall prey to aneffect we call dimensionality bias. As dimensionality of subspaces varies; approaches whichdo not take this effect into account fail to separate clusters from noise. We give a formaldefinition of dimensionality bias and analyze consequences for subspace clustering.

On using class-labels in evaluation of clusterings,Ines Färber; Stephan Günnemann; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Emmanuel Müller; Erich Schubert; Thomas Seidl; Arthur Zimek,ABSTRACT Although clustering has been studied for several decades; the fundamentalproblem of a valid evaluation has not yet been solved. The sound evaluation of clusteringresults in particular on real data is inherently difficult. In the literature; new clusteringalgorithms and their results are often externally evaluated with respect to an existing classlabeling. These class-labels; however; may not be adequate for the structure of the data orthe evaluated cluster model. Here; we survey the literature of different related researchareas that have observed this problem. We discuss common “defects” that clusteringalgorithms exhibit wrt this evaluation; and show them on several real world data sets ofdifferent domains along with a discussion why the detected clusters do not indicate a badperformance of the algorithm but are valid and useful results.

Statistical selection of relevant subspace projections for outlier ranking,Emmanuel Müller; Matthias Schiffer; Thomas Seidl,Outlier mining is an important data analysis task to distinguish exceptional outliers fromregular objects. For outlier mining in the full data space; there are well established methodswhich are successful in measuring the degree of deviation for outlier ranking. However; inrecent applications traditional outlier mining approaches miss outliers as they are hidden insubspace projections. Especially; outlier ranking approaches measuring deviation on allavailable attributes miss outliers deviating from their local neighborhood only in subsets ofthe attributes. In this work; we propose a novel outlier ranking based on the objects deviationin a statistically selected set of relevant subspace projections. This ensures to find objectsdeviating in multiple relevant subspaces; while it excludes irrelevant projections showing noclear contrast between outliers and the residual objects. Thus; we tackle the general …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,84
INSCY: Indexing subspace clusters with in-process-removal of redundancy,Ira Assent; Ralph Krieger; Emmanuel Müller; Thomas Seidl,Subspace clustering aims at detecting clusters in any subspace projection of a highdimensional space. As the number of projections is exponential in the number ofdimensions; efficiency is crucial. Moreover; the resulting subspace clusters are often highlyredundant; ie many clusters are detected multiply in several projections. We propose a novelindex for efficient subspace clustering in a novel depth-first processing with in-process-removal of redundant clusters for better pruning. Thorough experiments on real andsynthetic data show that INSCY yields substantial efficiency and quality improvements.,Data Mining; 2008. ICDM'08. Eighth IEEE International Conference on,2008,83
Focused clustering and outlier detection in large attributed graphs,Bryan Perozzi; Leman Akoglu; Patricia Iglesias Sánchez; Emmanuel Müller,Abstract Graph clustering and graph outlier detection have been studied extensively onplain graphs; with various applications. Recently; algorithms have been extended to graphswith attributes as often observed in the real-world. However; all of these techniques fail toincorporate the user preference into graph mining; and thus; lack the ability to steeralgorithms to more interesting parts of the attributed graph. In this work; we overcome thislimitation and introduce a novel user-oriented approach for mining attributed graphs. Thekey aspect of our approach is to infer user preference by the so-called focus attributesthrough a set of user-provided exemplar nodes. In this new problem setting; clusters andoutliers are then simultaneously mined according to this user preference. Specifically; ourFocusCO algorithm identifies the focus; extracts focused clusters and detects outliers …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2014,80
Relevant subspace clustering: Mining the most interesting non-redundant concepts in high dimensional data,Emmanuel Müller; Ira Assent; Stephan Günnemann; Ralph Krieger; Thomas Seidl,Subspace clustering aims at detecting clusters in any subspace projection of a highdimensional space. As the number of possible subspace projections is exponential in thenumber of dimensions; the result is often tremendously large. Recent approaches fail toreduce results to relevant subspace clusters. Their results are typically highly redundant; iemany clusters are detected multiple times in several projections. In this work; we propose anovel model for relevant subspace clustering (RESCU). We present a global optimizationwhich detects the most interesting non-redundant subspace clusters. We prove thatcomputation of this model is NP-hard. For RESCU; we propose an approximative solutionthat shows high accuracy with respect to our relevance model.

VISA: visual subspace clustering analysis,Ira Assent; Ralph Krieger; Emmanuel Müller; Thomas Seidl,Abstract To gain insight into today's large data resources; data mining extracts interestingpatterns. To generate knowledge from patterns and benefit from human cognitive abilities;meaningful visualization of patterns are crucial. Clustering is a data mining technique thataims at grouping data to patterns based on mutual (dis) similarity. For high dimensionaldata; subspace clustering searches patterns in any subspace of the attributes as patternsare typically obscured by many irrelevant attributes in the full space. For visual analysis ofsubspace clusters; their comparability has to be ensured. Existing subspace clusteringapproaches; however; lack interactive visualization and show bias with respect to thedimensionality of subspaces. In this work; dimensionality unbiased subspace clustering anda novel distance function for subspace clusters are proposed. We suggest two …,ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter,2007,55
Outlier ranking via subspace analysis in multiple views of the data,Emmanuel Muller; Ira Assent; Patricia Iglesias; Yvonne Mulle; Klemens Bohm,Outlier mining is an important task for finding anomalous objects. In practice; however; thereis not always a clear distinction between outliers and regular objects as objects havedifferent roles wrt different attribute sets. An object may deviate in one subspace; ie a subsetof attributes. And the same object might appear perfectly regular in other subspaces. Onecan think of subspaces as multiple views on one database. Traditional methods consideronly one view (the full attribute space). Thus; they miss complex outliers that are hidden inmultiple subspaces. In this work; we propose Outrank; a novel outlier ranking concept.Outrank exploits subspace analysis to determine the degree of outlierness. It considersdifferent subsets of the attributes as individual outlier properties. It compares clusteredregions in arbitrary subspaces and derives an outlierness score for each object.

Ranking outlier nodes in subspaces of attributed graphs,Emmanuel Muller; Patricia Iglesias Sánchez; Yvonne Mulle; Klemens Bohm,Outlier analysis is an important data mining task that aims to detect unexpected; rare; andsuspicious objects. Outlier ranking enables enhanced outlier exploration; which assists theuser-driven outlier analysis. It overcomes the binary detection of outliers vs. regular objects;which is not adequate for many applications. Traditional outlier ranking techniques focus oneither vector data or on graph structures. However; many of today's databases store both;multi dimensional numeric information and relations between objects in attributed graphs.An open challenge is how outlier ranking should cope with these different data types in aunified fashion. In this work; we propose a first approach for outlier ranking in subspaces ofattributed graphs. We rank graph nodes according to their degree of deviation in both graphand attribute properties. We describe novel challenges induced by this combination of …,Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,49
OutRank: ranking outliers in high dimensional data,Emmanuel Muller; Ira Assent; Uwe Steinhausen; Thomas Seidl,Outlier detection is an important data mining task for consistency checks; fraud detection;etc. Binary decision making on whether or not an object is an outlier is not appropriate inmany applications and moreover hard to parametrize. Thus; recently; methods for outlierranking have been proposed. Determining the degree of deviation; they do not requiresetting a decision boundary between outliers and the remaining data. High dimensional andheterogeneous (continuous and categorical attributes) data; however; pose a problem formost outlier ranking algorithms. In this work; we propose our OutRank approach for rankingoutliers in heterogeneous high dimensional data. We introduce a consistent model fordifferent attribute types. Our novel scoring functions transform the analyzed structure of thedata to a meaningful ranking. Promising results in preliminary experiments show the …,Data Engineering Workshop; 2008. ICDEW 2008.

External evaluation measures for subspace clustering,Stephan Günnemann; Ines Färber; Emmanuel Müller; Ira Assent; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Knowledge discovery in databases requires not only development of novel miningtechniques but also fair and comparable quality assessment based on objective evaluationmeasures. Especially in young research areas where no common measures are available;researchers are unable to provide a fair evaluation. Typically; publications glorify the highquality of one approach only justified by an arbitrary evaluation measure. However; suchconclusions can only be drawn if the evaluation measures themselves are fully understood.In this paper; we provide the basis for systematic evaluation in the emerging research areaof subspace clustering. We formalize general quality criteria for subspace clusteringmeasures not yet addressed in the literature. We compare the existing external evaluationmethods based on these criteria and pinpoint limitations.

Detection of orthogonal concepts in subspaces of high dimensional data,Stephan Günnemann; Emmanuel Müller; Ines Färber; Thomas Seidl,Abstract In the knowledge discovery process; clustering is an established technique forgrouping objects based on mutual similarity. However; in today's applications for each objectvery many attributes are provided. As multiple concepts described by different attributes aremixed in the same data set; clusters do not appear in all dimensions. In these highdimensional data spaces; each object can be clustered in several projections of the data.However; recent clustering techniques do not succeed in detection of these orthogonalconcepts hidden in the data. They either miss multiple concepts for each object bypartitioning approaches or provide redundant clusters in very similar subspaces. In this workwe propose a novel clustering method aiming only at orthogonal concept detection insubspaces of the data. Unlike existing clustering approaches; OSCLU (Orthogonal …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,39
DensEst: Density estimation for data mining in high dimensional spaces,Emmanuel Müller; Ira Assent; Ralph Krieger; Stephan Günnemann; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Subspace clustering and frequent itemset mining via “step-by-step” algorithms thatsearch the subspace/pattern lattice in a top-down or bottom-up fashion do not scale to largehigh dimensional data bases. Recent “jump” algorithms directly choose candidate subspaceregions or patterns. Their scalability and quality depend heavily on the rating of thesecandidates as mislead jumps incur poor results and costly candidate refinements. Existingtechniques rely on simple statistics with low estimation quality or on inefficient data basescans. In this work; we propose DensEst; an efficient density estimator with significantlyimproved accuracy. It efficiently provides rough estimates of object counts in selectivesubspace regions. Furthermore; by incorporating correlations between dimensions DensEstachieves not only efficient but also highly accurate estimations. We show how this density …,*,2009,35

Discovering multiple clustering solutions: Grouping objects in different views of the data,Emmanuel Muller; Stephan Gunnemann; Ines Farber; Thomas Seidl,Traditional clustering algorithms identify just a single clustering of the data. Today's complexdata; however; allow multiple interpretations leading to several valid groupings hidden indifferent views of the database. Each of these multiple clustering solutions is valuable andinteresting as different perspectives on the same data and several meaningful groupings foreach object are given. Especially for high dimensional data; where each object is describedby multiple attributes; alternative clusters in different attribute subsets are of major interest. Inthis tutorial; we describe several real world application scenarios for multiple clusteringsolutions. We abstract from these scenarios and provide the general challenges in thisemerging research area.

CMI: An information-theoretic contrast measure for enhancing subspace cluster and outlier detection,Hoang Vu Nguyen; Emmanuel Müller; Jilles Vreeken; Fabian Keller; Klemens Böhm,Abstract In many real world applications data is collected in multi-dimensional spaces; withthe knowledge hidden in subspaces (ie; subsets of the dimensions). It is an open researchissue to select meaningful subspaces without any prior knowledge about such hiddenpatterns. Standard approaches; such as pairwise correlation measures; or statisticalapproaches based on entropy; do not solve this problem; due to their restrictive pairwiseanalysis and loss of information in discretization they are bound to miss subspaces withpotential clusters and outliers. In this paper; we focus on finding subspaces with strongmutual dependency in the selected dimension set. Chosen subspaces should provide ahigh discrepancy between clusters and outliers and enhance detection of these patterns. Tomeasure this; we propose a novel contrast score that quantifies mutual correlations in …,*,2013,32
EDSC: efficient density-based subspace clustering,Ira Assent; Ralph Krieger; Emmanuel Müller; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Subspace clustering mines clusters hidden in subspaces of high-dimensional datasets. Density-based approaches have been shown to successfully mine clusters of arbitraryshape even in the presence of noise in full space clustering. Exhaustive search of all density-based subspace clusters; however; results in infeasible runtimes for large high-dimensionaldata sets. This is due to the exponential number of possible subspace projections in additionto the high computational cost of density-based clustering. In this paper; we proposelossless efficient detection of density-based subspace clusters. In our EDSC (efficientdensity-based subspace clustering) algorithm we reduce the high computational cost ofdensity-based subspace clustering by a complete multistep filter-and-refine algorithm.

Morpheus: interactive exploration of subspace clustering,Emmanuel Müller; Ira Assent; Ralph Krieger; Timm Jansen; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Data mining techniques extract interesting patterns out of large data resources.Meaningful visualization and interactive exploration of patterns are crucial for knowledgediscovery. Visualization techniques exist for traditional clustering in low dimensional spaces.In high dimensional data; clusters typically only exist in subspace projections. This subspaceclustering; however; lacks interactive visualization tools. Challenges arise from typicallylarge result sets in different subspace projections that hinder comparability; visualization andunderstandability.

EDISKCO: energy efficient distributed in-sensor-network k-center clustering with outliers,Marwan Hassani; Emmanuel Müller; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Clustering is an established data mining technique for grouping objects based onsimilarity. For sensor networks one aims at grouping sensor measurements in groups ofsimilar measurements. As sensor networks have limited resources in terms of availablememory and energy; a major task sensor clustering is efficient computation on sensornodes. As a dominating energy consuming task; communication has to be reduced for abetter energy efficiency. Considering memory; one has to reduce the amount of storedinformation on each sensor node. For in-network clustering; k-center based approachesprovide k representatives out of the collected sensor measurements. We propose EDISKCO;an outlier aware incremental method for efficient detection of k-center clusters.

Scalable density-based subspace clustering,Emmanuel Müller; Ira Assent; Stephan Günnemann; Thomas Seidl,Abstract For knowledge discovery in high dimensional databases; subspace clusteringdetects clusters in arbitrary subspace projections. Scalability is a crucial issue; as thenumber of possible projections is exponential in the number of dimensions. We propose ascalable density-based subspace clustering method that steers mining to few selectedsubspace clusters. Our novel steering technique reduces subspace processing byidentifying and clustering promising subspaces and their combinations directly. Thereby; itnarrows down the search space while maintaining accuracy. Thorough experiments on realand synthetic databases show that steering is efficient and scalable; with high quality results.For future work; our steering paradigm for density-based subspace clustering opensresearch potential for speeding up other subspace clustering approaches as well.,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,23
OpenSubspace: An open source framework for evaluation and exploration of subspace clustering algorithms in weka,Emmanuel Müller; Ira Assent; Stephan Günnemann; Thomas Seidl,Abstract: Subspace clustering and projected clustering are recent research areas forclustering in high dimensional spaces. As the field is rather young; there is a lack ofcomparative studies on the advantages and disadvantages of the different algorithms. Partof the underlying problem is the lack of available open source implementations that could beused by researchers to understand; compare; and extend subspace and projected clusteringalgorithms. In this paper; we discuss the requirements for open source evaluation software.We propose OpenSubspace; an open source framework that meets these requirements.OpenSubspace integrates state-of-the-art performance measures and visualizationtechniques to foster research in subspace and projected clustering.,Open Source in Data Mining Workshop (OSDM 2009) in conjunction with 13th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD 2009),2009,23
Multivariate maximal correlation analysis,Hoang Vu Nguyen; Emmanuel Müller; Jilles Vreeken; Pavel Efros; Klemens Böhm,Abstract Correlation analysis is one of the key elements of statistics; and has variousapplications in data analysis. Whereas most existing measures can only detect pairwisecorrelations between two dimensions; modern analysis aims at detecting correlations inmulti-dimensional spaces. We propose MAC; a novel multivariate correlation measuredesigned for discovering multidimensional patterns. It belongs to the powerful class ofmaximal correlation analysis; for which we propose a generalization to multivariate domains.We highlight the limitations of current methods in this class; and address these with MAC.Our experiments show that MAC outperforms existing solutions; is robust to noise; anddiscovers interesting and useful patterns.,International Conference on Machine Learning,2014,19

Adaptive outlierness for subspace outlier ranking,Emmanuel Müller; Matthias Schiffer; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Outlier mining is an important data analysis task to distinguish exceptional outliersfrom regular objects. However; in recent applications traditional outlier mining approachesmiss outliers as they are hidden in subspace projections. In this work; we propose a noveloutlier ranking based on the degree of deviation in subspaces. Object deviation is measuredonly in a selection of relevant subspaces and is based on adaptive neighborhoods in thesesubspaces. We show that our approach outperforms competing outlier ranking approachesby detecting outliers in arbitrary subspaces.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,18
HSM: Heterogeneous subspace mining in high dimensional data,Emmanuel Müller; Ira Assent; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Heterogeneous data; ie data with both categorical and continuous values; iscommon in many databases. However; most data mining algorithms assume eithercontinuous or categorical attributes; but not both. In high dimensional data; phenomena dueto the “curse of dimensionality” pose additional challenges. Usually; due to locally varyingrelevance of attributes; patterns do not show across the full set of attributes. In this paper wepropose HSM; which defines a new pattern model for heterogeneous high dimensional data.It allows data mining in arbitrary subsets of the attributes that are relevant for the respectivepatterns. Based on this model we propose an efficient algorithm; which is aware of theheterogeneity of the attributes. We extend an indexing structure for continuous attributessuch that HSM indexing adapts to different attribute types.

Unsupervised interaction-preserving discretization of multivariate data,Hoang-Vu Nguyen; Emmanuel Müller; Jilles Vreeken; Klemens Böhm,Abstract Discretization is the transformation of continuous data into discrete bins. It is animportant and general pre-processing technique; and a critical element of many data miningand data management tasks. The general goal is to obtain data that retains as muchinformation in the continuous original as possible. In general; but in particular for exploratorytasks; a key open question is how to discretize multivariate data such that significantassociations and patterns are preserved. That is exactly the problem we study in this paper.We propose IPD; an information-theoretic method for unsupervised discretization thatfocuses on preserving multivariate interactions. To this end; when discretizing a dimension;we consider the distribution of the data over all other dimensions. In particular; our methodexamines consecutive multivariate regions and combines them if (a) their multivariate …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2014,16
Local context selection for outlier ranking in graphs with multiple numeric node attributes,Patricia Iglesias Sánchez; Emmanuel Müller; Oretta Irmler; Klemens Böhm,Abstract Outlier ranking aims at the distinction between exceptional outliers and regularobjects by measuring deviation of individual objects. In graphs with multiple numericattributes; not all the attributes are relevant or show dependencies with the graph structure.Considering both graph structure and all given attributes; one cannot measure a cleardeviation of objects. This is because the existence of irrelevant attributes clearly hinders thedetection of outliers. Thus; one has to select local outlier contexts including only thoseattributes showing a high contrast between regular and deviating objects. It is an openchallenge to detect meaningful local contexts for each node in attributed graphs. In this work;we propose a novel local outlier ranking model for graphs with multiple numeric nodeattributes. For each object; our technique determines its subgraph and its statistically …,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2014,16
ASCLU: Alternative subspace clustering,Stephan Günnemann; Ines Färber; Emmanuel Müller; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Finding groups of similar objects in databases is one of the most important datamining tasks. Recently; traditional clustering approaches have been extended to generatealternative clustering solutions. The basic observation is that for each database objectmultiple meaningful groupings might exist: the data allows to be clustered through differentperspectives. It is thus reasonable to search for deviating clusters compared to a givenclustering result; that the user is not satisfied with. The existing methods focus on full spaceclustering. However; for today's applications; where many attributes per object are recorded;traditional clustering is known to generate no meaningful results. Instead; the analysis ofsubspace projections of the data with subspace or projected clustering techniques is moresuitable.

Statistical selection of congruent subspaces for mining attributed graphs,Patricia Iglesias Sánchez; Emmanuel Muller; Fabian Laforet; Fabian Keller; Klemens Bohm,Current mining algorithms for attributed graphs exploit dependencies between attributeinformation and edge structure; referred to as homophily. However; techniques fail if thisassumption does not hold for the full attribute space. In multivariate spaces; some attributeshave high dependency with the graph structure while others do not show any dependency.Hence; it is important to select congruent subspaces (ie; subsets of the node attributes)showing dependencies with the graph structure. In this work; we propose a method for thestatistical selection of such congruent subspaces. More specifically; we define a measurewhich assesses the degree of congruence between a set of attributes and the entire graph.We use it as the core of a statistical test; which congruent subspaces must pass.

4s: Scalable subspace search scheme overcoming traditional apriori processing,Hoang Vu Nguyen; Emmanuel Muller; Klemens Bohm,In many real-world applications; data is collected in multi-dimensional spaces. However; notall dimensions are relevant for data analysis. Instead; interesting knowledge is hidden incorrelated subsets of dimensions (ie; subspaces of the original space). Detecting thesecorrelated subspaces independent of the underlying mining task is an open researchproblem. It is challenging due to the exponential search space. Existing methods have triedto tackle this by utilizing Apriori search schemes. However; they show poor scalability andmiss high quality subspaces. This paper features a scalable subspace search scheme (4S);which overcomes the efficiency problem by departing from the traditional levelwise search.We propose a new generalized notion of correlated subspaces which gives way totransforming the search space to a correlation graph of dimensions.

Out of each group; oneselected node will be the group representative for forwarding the data collected by its group.This considerably reduces the total energy consumption; as only representatives need tocommunicate with distant data sink. In data mining; one is interested in constructing thesephysical clusters according to similar measurements of sensor nodes.

Efficient cluster detection by ordered neighborhoods,Emin Aksehirli; Bart Goethals; Emmanuel Müller,Abstract Detecting cluster structures seems to be a simple task; ie separating similar fromdissimilar objects. However; given today's complex data;(dis-) similarity measures andtraditional clustering algorithms are not reliable in separating clusters from each other. Forexample; when too many dimensions are considered simultaneously; objects becomeunique and (dis-) similarity does not provide meaningful information to detect clustersanymore. While the (dis-) similarity measures might be meaningful for individual dimensions;algorithms fail to combine this information for cluster detection. In particular; it is the severeissue of a combinatorial search space that results in inefficient algorithms. In this paper wepropose a cluster detection method based on the ordered neighborhoods.

Mining probabilistic representative frequent patterns from uncertain data,Chunyang Liu; Ling Chen; Chengqi Zhang,Abstract Probabilistic frequent pattern mining over uncertain data has received a great dealof attention recently due to the wide applications of uncertain data. Similar to its counterpartin deterministic databases; however; probabilistic frequent pattern mining suffers from thesame problem of generating an exponential number of result patterns. The large number ofdiscovered patterns hinders further evaluation and analysis; and calls for the need to find asmall number of representative patterns to approximate all other patterns.

Flexible fault tolerant subspace clustering for data with missing values,Stephan Gunnemann; Emmanuel Muller; Sebastian Raubach; Thomas Seidl,In today's applications; data analysis tasks are hindered by many attributes per object aswell as by faulty data with missing values. Subspace clustering tackles the challenge ofmany attributes by cluster detection in any subspace projection of the data. However; itposes novel challenges for handling missing values of objects; which are part of multiplesubspace clusters in different projections of the data. In this work; we propose a general faulttolerance definition enhancing subspace clustering models to handle missing values. Weintroduce a flexible notion of fault tolerance that adapts to the individual characteristics ofsubspace clusters and ensures a robust parameterization. Allowing missing values in ourmodel increases the computational complexity of subspace clustering. Thus; we prove novelmonotonicity properties for an efficient computation of fault tolerant subspace clusters …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on,2011,11
Identifying User Interests within the Data Space-a Case Study with SkyServer.,Hoang Vu Nguyen; Klemens Böhm; Florian Becker; Bertrand Goldman; Georg Hinkel; Emmanuel Müller,ABSTRACT Many scientific databases nowadays are publicly available for querying andadvanced data analytics. One prominent example is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)—SkyServer; which offers data to astronomers; scientists; and the general public. For suchdata it is important to understand the public focus; and trending research directions on thesubject described by the database; ie; astronomy in the case of SkyServer. With a large userbase; it is worthwhile to identify the areas of the data space that are of interest to users. Inthis paper; we study the problem of extracting and analyzing access areas of user queries;by analyzing the query logs of the database. To our knowledge; both the concept of accessareas and how to extract them have not been studied before. We address this by firstproposing a novel notion of access area; which is independent of any specific database …,EDBT,2015,9
Cartification: A neighborhood preserving transformation for mining high dimensional data,Emin Aksehirli; Bart Goethals; Emmanuel Muller; Jilles Vreeken,The analysis of high dimensional data comes with many intrinsic challenges. In particular;cluster structures become increasingly hard to detect when the data includes dimensionsirrelevant to the individual clusters. With increasing dimensionality; distances between pairsof objects become very similar; and hence; meaningless for knowledge discovery. In thispaper we propose Cartification; a new transformation to circumvent this problem. Wetransform each object into an item set; which represents the neighborhood of the object. Wedo this for multiple views on the data; resulting in multiple neighborhoods per object. Thistransformation enables us to preserve the essential pair wise-similarities of objects overmultiple views; and hence; to improve knowledge discovery in high dimensional data.

Outlier detection and ranking based on subspace clustering,Thomas Seidl; Emmanuel Müller; Ira Assent; Uwe Steinhausen,Abstract Detecting outliers is an important task for many applications including frauddetection or consistency validation in real world data. Particularly in the presence ofuncertain data or imprecise data; similar objects regularly deviate in their attribute values.The notion of outliers has thus to be defined carefully. When considering outlier detection asa task which is complementary to clustering; binary decisions whether an object is regardedto be an outlier or not seem to be near at hand. For high-dimensional data; however; objectsmay belong to different clusters in different subspaces. More fine-grained concepts to defineoutliers are therefore demanded. By our new OutRank approach; we address outlierdetection in heterogeneous high dimensional data and propose a novel scoring function thatprovides a consistent model for ranking outliers in the presence of different attribute types …,Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings,2009,9
Less is more: Non-redundant subspace clustering,Ira Assent; Emmanuel Müller; Stephan Günnemann; Ralph Krieger; Thomas Seidl,ABSTRACT Clustering is an important data mining task for grouping similar objects. In highdimensional data; however; effects attributed to the “curse of dimensionality”; renderclustering in high dimensional data meaningless. Due to this; recent years have seenresearch on subspace clustering which searches for clusters in relevant subspaceprojections of high dimensional data. As the number of possible subspace projections isexponential in the number of dimensions; the number of possible subspace clusters can beoverwhelming. In this position paper; we present our work on identifying non-redundant;relevant subspace clusters which reduce the result set to a manageable size. We discusstechniques for evaluating; visualizing and exploring subspace clusterings; and proposesome directions for future work.,MultiClust: 1st international workshop on discovering; summarizing and using multiple clusterings held in conjunction with KDD 2010,2010,8
Subspace outlier mining in large multimedia databases,Ira Assent; Ralph Krieger; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Increasingly large multimedia databases in life sciences; e-commerce; ormonitoring applications cannot be browsed manually; but require automatic knowledgediscovery in databases (KDD) techniques to detect novel and interesting patterns. One of themajor tasks in KDD; clustering; aims at grouping similar objects into clusters; separatingdissimilar objects. Density-based clustering has been shown to detect arbitrarily shapedclusters even in noisy data bases. In high-dimensional data bases; meaningful clusters canno longer be detected due to the â€ žcurse of dimensionalityâ€ œ. Consequently; subspaceclustering searches for clusters hidden in any subset of the set of dimensions. As the numberof subspaces is exponential in the number of dimensions; traditional approaches use fixedpruning thresholds. This results in dimensionality bias; ie with growing dimensionality …,Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings,2007,8
Efficient algorithms for a robust modularity-driven clustering of attributed graphs,Patricia Iglesias Sánchez; Emmanuel Müller; Uwe Leo Korn; Klemens Böhm; Andrea Kappes; Tanja Hartmann; Dorothea Wagner,Abstract Clustering methods based on modularity are wellestablished and widely used forgraph data. However; today's applications store additional attribute information for eachnode in the graph. This attribute information may even be contradicting with the graphstructure; which raises a major challenge for the simultaneous mining of both informationsources. For attributed graphs it is essential to be aware of such contradicting effects causedby irrelevant attributes and highly deviating attribute values of outlier nodes. In this work; wefocus on the robustness of graph clustering wrt irrelevant attributes and outliers. We proposea modularity-driven approach for parameter-free clustering of attributed graphs and severalefficient algorithms for its computation. The efficiency is achieved by our incrementalcalculation of attribute information within these modularity-driven algorithms. In our …,*,2015,7
Estimating mutual information on data streams,Fabian Keller; Emmanuel Müller; Klemens Böhm,Abstract Mutual information is a well-established and broadly used concept in informationtheory. It allows to quantify the mutual dependence between two variables--an essential taskin data analysis. For static data; a broad range of techniques addresses the problem ofestimating mutual information. However; the assumption of static data is not applicable fortoday's dynamic data sources such as data streams: In contrast to static approaches; anonline estimator must be able to deal with the evolving; changing; and infinite nature of thestream. Furthermore; some tasks require the estimation to be available online whileprocessing the raw data stream. Our proposed solution M ise (Mutual Information StreamEstimation) allows a user to issue mutual information queries in arbitrary time windows.

MultiClust special issue on discovering; summarizing and using multiple clusterings,Emmanuel Müller; Ira Assent; Stephan Günnemann; Thomas Seidl; Jennifer Dy,Traditionally; clustering has focused on discovering a single grouping of the data. In manyapplications; however; data is collected for multiple analysis tasks. Several features ormeasurements provide complex or high dimensional information. In such data; one typicallyobserves several valid groupings; ie each data object fits in different roles. In contrast totraditional clustering these multiple clusterings describe alternative aspects that characterizethe data in different ways. Traditional single clustering solutions can thus be regarded asspecial cases of multiple clustering solutions; where only a single set of clusters representsone notion of intra-cluster similarity and inter-cluster dissimilarity. The generality of multipleclustering solutions allows capturing multi-faceted information in more than a singlesimilarity notion; while making it more challenging to detect cluster structures.,*,2015,6
OutRules: a framework for outlier descriptions in multiple context spaces,Emmanuel Müller; Fabian Keller; Sebastian Blanc; Klemens Böhm,Abstract Analyzing exceptional objects is an important mining task. It includes theidentification of outliers but also the description of outlier properties in contrast to regularobjects. However; existing detection approaches miss to provide important descriptions thatallow human understanding of outlier reasons. In this work we present OutRules; aframework for outlier descriptions that enable an easy understanding of multiple outlierreasons in different contexts. We introduce outlier rules as a novel outlier description model.A rule illustrates the deviation of an outlier in contrast to its context that is considered to benormal. Our framework highlights the practical use of outlier rules and provides the basis forfuture development of outlier description models.,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2012,6

Advancedsystem state acquisition methods are required for a more sophisticated power grid control.Several challenges arise from this topic; and must be tackled in a highly interdisciplinaryresearch area. At KIT we have constituted such an interdisciplinary team at SimLab Energy;which investigates new power grid analysis from a simulation-oriented perspective. Usingthe new concept we evaluate distributed voltage time series instead of recording phasorinformation only. In this article we describe the methods used for our approach.

Sensitivity of self-tuning histograms: query order affecting accuracy and robustness,Andranik Khachatryan; Emmanuel Müller; Christian Stier; Klemens Böhm,Abstract In scientific databases; the amount and the complexity of data calls for datasummarization techniques. Such summaries are used to assist fast approximate queryanswering or query optimization. Histograms are a prominent class of model-free datasummaries and are widely used in database systems. So-called self-tuning histograms lookat query-execution results to refine themselves. An assumption with such histograms is thatthey can learn the dataset from scratch. We show that this is not the case and highlight amajor challenge that stems from this. Traditional self-tuning is overly sensitive to the order ofqueries; and reaches only local optima with high estimation errors. We show that a self-tuning method can be improved significantly if it starts with a carefully chosen initialconfiguration.

Efficient selectivity estimation by histogram construction based on subspace clustering,Andranik Khachatryan; Emmanuel Müller; Klemens Böhm; Jonida Kopper,Abstract Modern databases have to cope with multi-dimensional queries. For efficientprocessing of these queries; query optimization relies on multi-dimensional selectivityestimation techniques. These techniques in turn typically rely on histograms. A corechallenge of histogram construction is the detection of regions with a density higher than theones of their surroundings. In this paper; we show that subspace clustering algorithms;which detect such regions; can be used to build high quality histograms in multi-dimensionalspaces. The clusters are transformed into a memory-efficient histogram representation; whilepreserving most of the information for the selectivity estimation. We derive a formal criterionfor our transformation of clusters into buckets that minimizes the introduced estimation error.In practice; finding optimal buckets is hard; so we propose a heuristic.

Flexible and adaptive subspace search for outlier analysis,Fabian Keller; Emmanuel Müller; Andreas Wixler; Klemens Böhm,Abstract There exists a variety of traditional outlier models; which measure the deviation ofoutliers with respect to the full attribute space. However; these techniques fail to detectoutliers that deviate only wrt an attribute subset. To address this problem; recent techniquesfocus on a selection of subspaces that allow:(1) A clear distinction between clustered objectsand outliers;(2) a description of outlier reasons by the selected subspaces. However;depending on the outlier model used; different objects in different subspaces have thehighest deviation. It is an open research issue to make subspace selection adaptive to theoutlier score of each object and flexible wrt the use of different outlier models. In this work wepropose such a flexible and adaptive subspace selection scheme. Our generic processingallows instantiations with different outlier models.

A Framework for Evaluation and Exploration of Clustering Algorithms in Subspaces of High Dimensional Databases.,Emmanuel Müller; Ira Assent; Stephan Günnemann; Patrick Gerwert; Matthias Hannen; Timm Jansen; Thomas Seidl,Abstract: In high dimensional databases; traditional full space clustering methods are knownto fail due to the curse of dimensionality. Thus; in recent years; subspace clustering andprojected clustering approaches were proposed for clustering in high dimensional spaces.As the area is rather young; few comparative studies on the advantages and disadvantagesof the different algorithms exist. Part of the underlying problem is the lack of available opensource implementations that could be used by researchers to understand; compare; andextend subspace and projected clustering algorithms. In this work; we discuss therequirements for open source evaluation software and propose the OpenSubspaceframework that meets these requirements.

Air-indexing on error prone communication channels,Emmanuel Müller; Philipp Kranen; Michael Nett; Felix Reidl; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Air-Indexing aims at efficient data dissemination via a wireless broadcast channel toa multitude of mobile clients. As mobile devices have very limited resources; energyefficiency is crucial in such scenarios. Moreover; one has to cope with high error rates onwireless transmissions resulting in packet losses which lead to high energy consumptionand long waiting times until a query result is available. We propose a novel cross-layerscheduling with adaptive error correction which enables flexible query optimization onmobile clients. RepAir ensures efficiency by adapting its query processing according to theindividual error rate of each client. Thorough experiments show that RepAir yieldssubstantial efficiency improvements in terms of access latency and tuning time compared tocompeting Air-Indexing approaches.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,4

Semi-automated exploration of data warehouses,Thibault Sellam; Emmanuel Müller; Martin Kersten,Abstract Exploratory data analysis tries to discover novel dependencies and unexpectedpatterns in large databases. Traditionally; this process is manual and hypothesis-driven.However; analysts can come short of patience and imagination. In this paper; we introduceClaude; a hypothesis generator for data warehouses. Claude follows a 2-step approach:(1)It detects interesting views; by exploiting non-linear statistical dependencies between thedimensions and the measure.(2) To explain its findings; it detects local patterns in theseviews and describes them with SQL queries. Technically; we derive a model ofinterestingness from fundamental information theory. To exploit this model; we presentaggressive approximations and heuristics; allowing Claude to be fast and more accuratethan state-of-art view selection algorithms.,Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2015,3
Detecting correlated columns in relational databases with mixed data types,Hoang Vu Nguyen; Emmanuel Müller; Periklis Andritsos; Klemens Böhm,Abstract In a database; besides known dependencies among columns (eg; foreign key andprimary key constraints); there are many other correlations unknown to the database users.Extraction of such hidden correlations is known to be useful for various tasks in databaseoptimization and data analytics. However; the task is challenging due to the lack ofmeasures to quantify column correlations. Correlations may exist among columns of differentdata types and value domains; which makes techniques based on value matchinginapplicable. Besides; a column may have multiple semantics; which does not allow disjointpartitioning of columns. Finally; from a computational perspective; one has to consider ahuge search space that grows exponentially with the number of columns. In this paper; wepresent a novel method for detecting column correlations (DeCoRel).

Such summaries are used to assist fast approximate query answering or queryoptimization. Histograms are a prominent class of model-free data summaries and arewidely used in database systems. So-called self-tuning histograms look at query-executionresults to refine themselves. An assumption with such histograms; which has not beenquestioned so far; is that they can learn the dataset from scratch; that is-starting with anempty bucket configuration. We show that this is not the case. Self-tuning methods are verysensitive to the initial configuration. Three major problems stem from this. Traditional self-tuning is unable to learn projections of multi-dimensional data; is sensitive to the order ofqueries; and reaches only local optima with high estimation errors.

Moreover; not all clusteringmethods can work with raw or dirty data. In this paper; we introduce an interactive dataexploration tool; VINeM; which combines interactive mining with unsupervised tools byexploiting an intuitive neighborhood-based visualization technique. Local neighborhoodbased visualization is useful not only for analyzing multiple (dis-) similarity measures butalso for effectively discarding noise.

A Near-Linear Time Subspace Search Scheme for Unsupervised Selection of Correlated Features,Hoang-Vu Nguyen; Emmanuel Müller; Klemens Böhm,Abstract In many real-world applications; data is collected in high dimensional spaces.However; not all dimensions are relevant for data analysis. Instead; interesting knowledge ishidden in correlated subsets of dimensions (ie; subspaces of the original space). Detectingthese correlated subspaces independently of the underlying mining task is an openresearch problem. It is challenging due to the exponential search space. Existing methodshave tried to tackle this by utilizing Apriori search schemes. However; their worst casecomplexity is exponential in the number of dimensions; and even in practice they show poorscalability while missing high quality subspaces.

Including Multi-feature Interactions and Redundancy for Feature Ranking in Mixed Datasets,Arvind Kumar Shekar; Tom Bocklisch; Patricia Iglesias Sánchez; Christoph Nikolas Straehle; Emmanuel Müller,Abstract Feature ranking is beneficial to gain knowledge and to identify the relevant featuresfrom a high-dimensional dataset. However; in several datasets; few features by itself mighthave small correlation with the target classes; but by combining these features with someother features; they can be strongly correlated with the target. This means that multiplefeatures exhibit interactions among themselves. It is necessary to rank the features based onthese interactions for better analysis and classifier performance. However; evaluating theseinteractions on large datasets is computationally challenging. Furthermore; datasets oftenhave features with redundant information. Using such redundant features hinders bothefficiency and generalization capability of the classifier.

Discovering Overlapping Quantitative Associations by Density-Based Mining of Relevant Attributes,Thomas Van Brussel; Emmanuel Müller; Bart Goethals,Abstract Association rule mining is an often used method to find relationships in the data andhas been extensively studied in the literature. Unfortunately; most of these methods do notwork well for numerical attributes. State-of-the-art quantitative association rule miningalgorithms follow a common routine:(1) discretize the data and (2) mine for association rules.Unfortunately; this two-step approach can be rather inaccurate as discretization partitionsthe data space. This misses rules that are present in overlapping intervals. In this paper; weexplore the data for quantitative association rules hidden in overlapping regions of numericdata. Our method works without the need for a discretization step; and thus; preventsinformation loss in partitioning numeric attributes prior to the mining step. It exploits astatistical test for selecting relevant attributes; detects relationships of dense intervals in …,International Symposium on Foundations of Information and Knowledge Systems,2016,*
Keynote abstract: Subspace search for community detection and community outlier mining in attributed graphs,Emmanuel Müller,Attributed graphs are widely used for the representation of social networks; gene and proteininteractions; communication networks; or product co-purchase in web stores. Each object isrepresented by its relationships to other objects (edge structure) and its individual properties(node attributes). For instance; social networks store friendship relations as edges and age;income; and other properties as attributes. These relationships and properties seem to bedependent on each other and exploiting these dependencies is beneficial; eg for communitydetection and community outlier mining. However; state-of-the-art techniques highly rely onthis dependency assumption. In particular; community outlier mining is able to detect anoutlier node if and only if connected nodes have similar values in all attributes. Suchassumptions are generally known as homophily and are widely used. However; looking …,Semantic and Social Media Adaptation and Personalization (SMAP); 2015 10th International Workshop on,2015,*

Big Data Research,Hoang-Vu Nguyen; Emmanuel Müller; Klemens Böhm,The notion of correlation is one of the key elements of statistics and is important for manyareas of applied science. For instance; correlations have just recently been exploited inentropy-based dependency analysis to identify novel structures in global health and humangut microbiota data [38]. In data mining; correlations of dimensions often indicate theexistence of patterns (eg; for clustering [9]; outlier mining [20]; or as supervised featureselection for classification [16]); and are thus very important for knowledge discovery. In highdimensional data; however; patterns are often obscured in the full-space due to thepresence of noisy features [7]. Instead; patterns can be found in (possibly overlapping)correlated subsets of dimensions; so-called correlated subspaces of the original data space.Detecting such subspaces; commonly referred to as,*,2014,*

3rd MultiClust Workshop: Discovering; Summarizing and Using Multiple Clusterings,Emmanuel Müller; Thomas Seidl; Suresh Venkatasubramanian; Arthur Zimek,This cross-disciplinary research topic on multiple clustering solutions has receivedsignificant attention in recent years. However; since it is relatively young; important researchchallenges remain. Specifically; we observe an emerging interest in discovering multipleclustering solutions from very high dimensional and complex databases. Detectingalternatives while avoiding redundancy is a key challenge for multiple clustering solutions.Toward this goal; important research issues include how to define redundancy amongclusterings; whether existing algorithms can be modified to accommodate this goal; howmany solutions should be extracted; how to select among far too many possible solutions;how to evaluate and visualize results; brief; how to most effectively help the data analyst infinding what he or she is looking for.

Instant Selection of High Contrast Projections in Multi-Dimensional Data Streams,Andrei Vanea; Emmanuel Müller; Fabian Keller; Klemens Böhm,Abstract. In many of today's applications we have to cope with multidimensional datastreams containing dimensions which are not relevant to a particular stream mining task.These irrelevant dimensions hinder knowledge discovery as they lead to noisy distributionsin the full dimensional space; while knowledge is hidden in some sets of dependentdimensions. This dependence of dimensions may change over time and poses a majoropen challenge to stream mining. In this work; we focus on dependent dimensions having ahigh contrast; ie they show a clear separation between outliers and clustered objects. Wepresent HCP-StreamMiner; a method for selecting high-contrast projections in multi-dimensional streams. Our quality measure (the contrast) of each projection is statisticallydetermined by comparing the data distribution in a set of dimensions to their marginal …,*,2012,*
eCML PKDD 2011,Emmanuel Muller; Stephan Gunnemann; Ira Assent; Thomas Seidl,Traditional clustering algorithms identify just a single clustering of the data. However; today'scomplex and high dimensional data allow multiple interpretations for each data object; andthus; several valid groupings (multiple clustering solutions) can be detected. Recently; anemerging research direction; focusing on detecting; summarizing and using such multipleclustering solutions; has evolved out of this problem. This new clustering paradigm hasattracted attention from many researchers and resulted in a number of important publicationsat leading data mining and machine learning conferences. Focusing on this novel paradigm;the MultiClust workshop attracts a variety of researchers working on different probleminstances of multiple clustering solutions.

Biomedical Databases and Data Mining,Claudia Plant; Christian Böhm,Medicine; biology; and life sciences are very data intensive disciplines. All kinds of data are producedin tremendous amounts; eg text; semi- structured data; images; time-series; data streams; andoften very high dimensional feature vectors. Modern devices for data acquisition allow to recordmore and more information. High resolution mass spectrometry; for example; allows us to measureand quantify hundreds of metabolites or peptides from one biosample. At the level of raw massspectra even hundreds of thousands of features are measured per sample.

Mining Subspace Clusters: Enhanced Models; Efficient Algorithms and an Objective Evaluation Study,Emmanuel Müller,ABSTRACT In the knowledge discovery process; clustering is an established technique forgrouping objects based on mutual similarity. However; in today's applications for each objectvery many attributes are provided in large and high dimensional databases. As multipleconcepts described by different attributes are mixed in the same data set; clusters arehidden in subspace projections and do not appear in all dimensions. Subspace clusteringaims at detecting such clusters in any projection of the database. This work presents anoverview of my dissertation on subspace clustering models; efficient processing schemes forthese models and an objective evaluation study on subspace clustering techniques. Thiswork highlights several open challenges and our research work with which we tackled thesechallenges. Furthermore; as a general contribution to the community; the benefits of our …,*,2010,*
Counterfeit Detection by Extracting Rules from Product Traces,Lingyu Wang; Nina Oertel; Emmanuel Müller; Thomas Seidl,ABSTRACT Many product authentication approaches have been developed to detectcounterfeits in the supply chain. In this paper; we propose a novel approach by extractingsequential rules from the tracking data of genuine products and use them to verify productswith unknown authenticity. In reality; the supply chains can be very complex and dynamic; soit is very important that the proposed approach provides a succinct and flexiblerepresentation of the detection model. It can achieve high accuracy even when the supplychain changes during operation.,Intelligent Systems and Control,2009,*
SubRank: Ranking Local Outliers in Projections of High-Dimensional Spaces.,Matthias Schiffer; Emmanuel Müller; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Outlier mining has become an increasingly urgent issue in the KDD process; sinceit may be the case that finding exceptional events is more interesting than searching forcommon patterns. These outliers are most relevant to be found for instance in frauddetection processes. Unfortunately; existing approaches do not take into account thatincreasing dimensionality leads to a novel understanding of locality. Objects have to beinvestigated locally in different projections of the original space to overcome a crucialproblem: The outlier property might be occluded by the shear number of dimensions. Beingaware of this breach; in the course of my diploma thesis; I developed a novel; effectivemethod; SubRank; to rank objects which are outliers only in some subspaces. Finally; itgives a concise explanation of the composition of the ranking itself.,Datenbank-Spektrum,2009,*
Evaluating Clustering in...,Emmanuel Müller; Stephan Günnemann; Ira Assent; Thomas Seidl,Abstract Clustering high dimensional data is an emerging research field. Subspaceclustering or projected clustering group similar objects in subspaces; ie projections; of thefull space. In the past decade; several clustering paradigms have been developed inparallel; without thorough evaluation and comparison between these paradigms on acommon basis. Conclusive evaluation and comparison is challenged by three major issues.First; there is no ground truth that describes the “true” clusters in real world data. Second; alarge variety of evaluation measures have been used that reflect different aspects of theclustering result. Finally; in typical publications authors have limited their analysis to theirfavored paradigm only; while paying other paradigms little or no attention. In this paper; wetake a systematic approach to evaluate the major paradigms in a common framework. We …,*,2009,*
Evolutionary subspace search in biologically inspired optimal niches,Ira Assent; Ralph Krieger; Emmanuel Müller; Andreas Steffens; Thomas Seidl,ABSTRACT: Knowledge discovery in large multimedia databases permits informationextraction from ubiquitous data archives. Clustering groups objects based on mutual (dis-)similarity; yet does not scale to high-dimensional databases. In high-dimensional data;clusters are typically hidden by locally irrelevant attributes. Subspace clustering aims todetect clusters in locally relevant subspace of the attributes. We propose to an evolutionarysubspace search approach to detect locally relevant attributes for clustering. Ourevolutionary subspace search optimizes a multi-objective goal; as more than one subspacesare interesting for clustering. We propose modelling evolutionary niches to ensure thatsubspace individuals in local optima are preserved while novel evolutionary solutions arise.We analyze our evolutionary model; and provide experimental evaluation to demonstrate …,Proc.

Removing Dimensionality Bias in Density-based Subspace Clustering,Ira Assent; Ralph Krieger; Emmanuel Müller; Thomas Seidl,Abstract. In many scientific settings; engineering processes; and business applicationsranging from experimental sensor data and process control data to telecommunication trafficobservation and financial transaction monitoring; huge amounts of high-dimensionalmeasurement data are produced and stored. Whereas sensor equipment as well as bigstorage devices get cheaper every day; data analysis tools and techniques lag behind.Clustering methods are common solutions to unsupervised learning problems where neitherany expert knowledge nor some helpful annotation for the data is available. In general;clustering groups the data objects in a way that similar objects get together in clusterswhereas objects from different clusters are of high dissimilarity. A typical observation;however; is that clustering reveals almost no structure even it is known there must be …,*,2007,*

Unsupervised Anomaly Detection: Representation Learning for Predictive Maintenance over Time,Emmanuel Müller,Anomaly detection is the task of identifying patterns and points in the data that are highlydeviating; unexpected; or unusual in comparison to the overall data distribution or in thecontext of a specific application. In this project we study the detection of anomalies inmultivariate time series data using deep learning techniques. The task of finding anomaliesin (multivariate) time series is posed in a great variety of applications such as industrial faultand damage detection for predictive maintenance; detecting abnormal patterns and extremevalues in stock markets; monitoring network traffic for intrusion detection and cybersecurity;or detecting events in IoT sensor systems. The challenge in many of those applications isthat the types of anomalies and the patterns they show in the data are either unknown orvery costly to obtain. In contrast; time series data recordings of “normal” states are usually …,*,*,*

Randomized Quantitative Association Rules,Bart Goethals; Emmanuel Müller; Thomas Van Brussel,Abstract. Traditional association rules are commonly used to find relationships in binary orcategorical data and have been extensively studied in the literature. Quantitative associationrules are a natural extension; which allow for detection of interpretable relationships innumeric data. However; quantitative association rule mining suffers from tremendously largeresult sets and inefficient computation just like traditional techniques. Here; we propose arandomized technique for quantitative association rules. We statistically select unexpectedrules; which provide sufficient new information about the underlying data relationships.Furthermore; we exploit unexpectedness for the efficient steering of our randomized searchand as termination criterion of our algorithm. Overall; our algorithm can quickly generate asmall number of high quality rules that are easily interpretable by the user.,*,*,*
What is hidden in my network?,Emmanuel Müller,Graphs are widely used for the representation of social networks; gene and proteininteractions; communication networks; or product co-purchase in web stores. In this projectwe study attributed graphs in which nodes and edges have additional attribute information(eg age in a social network). Attributed graphs are very common as they model bothrelationships (edges) between objects (nodes) as well as object and relationshipdescriptions (node/edge attributes). However; analyzing such complex graphs with millionsof nodes/edges and thousands of attributes is very hard. Typically; the graph is storing alltypes of information; while one specific user is only interested in a subset of this information.Inferring such subset is still an open challenge. We aim at an interactive exploration ofattributed graphs; assisting the user by automated methods. We provide portions of the …,*,*,*
