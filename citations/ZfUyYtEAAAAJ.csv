Sparse localized deformation components,Thomas Neumann; Kiran Varanasi; Stephan Wenger; Markus Wacker; Marcus Magnor; Christian Theobalt,Abstract We propose a method that extracts sparse and spatially localized deformationmodes from an animated mesh sequence. To this end; we propose a new way to extend thetheory of sparse matrix decompositions to 3D mesh sequence processing; and furthercontribute with an automatic way to ensure spatial locality of the decomposition in a newoptimization framework. The extracted dimensions often have an intuitive and clearinterpretable meaning. Our method optionally accepts user-constraints to guide the processof discovering the underlying latent deformation space. The capabilities of our efficient;versatile; and easy-to-implement method are extensively demonstrated on a variety of datasets and application contexts. We demonstrate its power for user friendly intuitive editing ofcaptured mesh animations; such as faces; full body motion; cloth animations; and muscle …,ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG),2013,41
Capture and Statistical Modeling of Arm‐Muscle Deformations,T Neumann; K Varanasi; N Hasler; M Wacker; M Magnor; C Theobalt,Abstract We present a comprehensive data-driven statistical model for skin and muscledeformation of the human shoulder-arm complex. Skin deformations arise from complex bio-physical effects such as non-linear elasticity of muscles; fat; and connective tissue; and varywith physiological constitution of the subjects and external forces applied during motion.Thus; they are hard to model by direct physical simulation. Our alternative approach isbased on learning deformations from multiple subjects performing different exercises undervarying external forces. We capture the training data through a novel multi-camera approachthat is able to reconstruct fine-scale muscle detail in motion. The resulting reconstructionsfrom several people are aligned into one common shape parametrization; and learned usinga semi-parametric non-linear method. Our learned data-driven model is fast; compact and …,Computer Graphics Forum,2013,38
Compressed Manifold Modes for Mesh Processing,T Neumann; K Varanasi; C Theobalt; M Magnor; M Wacker,Abstract This paper introduces compressed eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operatoron 3D manifold surfaces. They constitute a novel functional basis; called the compressedmanifold basis; where each function has local support. We derive an algorithm; based on thealternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM); to compute this basis on a giventriangulated mesh. We show that compressed manifold modes identify key shape features;yielding an intuitive understanding of the basis for a human observer; where a shape can beprocessed as a collection of parts. We evaluate compressed manifold modes for potentialapplications in shape matching and mesh abstraction. Our results show that this basis hasdistinct advantages over existing alternatives; indicating high potential for a wide range ofuse-cases in mesh processing.,Computer Graphics Forum,2014,26
High resolution image correspondences for video Post-Production,Christian Lipski; Christian Linz; Thomas Neumann; M Wacker; M Magnor,We present an algorithm for estimating dense image correspondences. Our versatileapproach lends itself to various tasks typical for video post-processing; including imagemorphing; optical flow estimation; stereo rectification; disparity/depth reconstruction andbaseline adjustment. We incorporate recent advances in feature matching; energyminimization; stereo vision and data clustering into our approach. At the core of ourcorrespondence estimation we use Efficient Belief Propagation for energy minimization.While state-of-the-art algorithms only work on thumbnail-sized images; our novel featuredownsampling scheme in combination with a simple; yet efficient data term compression cancope with high-resolution data. The incorporation of SIFT features into data termcomputation further resolves matching ambiguities; making long-range correspondence …,Visual Media Production (CVMP); 2010 Conference on,2010,24
Capture of arm-muscle deformations using a depth-camera,Nadia Robertini; Thomas Neumann; Kiran Varanasi; Christian Theobalt,Abstract Modeling realistic skin deformations due to underneath muscle bulging has a widerange of applications in medicine; entertainment and art. Current acquisition systems basedon dense markers and multiple synchronized cameras are able to record and reproduce fine-scale skin deformations with sufficient quality. However; the complexity and the high cost ofthese systems severely limit their applicability. In this paper; we propose a method forreconstructing fine-scale arm muscle deformations using the Kinect depth camera. Thecaptured data from the depth camera has no temporal contiguity and suffers from noise andsensory artifacts; and thus unsuitable by itself for potential applications in visual mediaproduction or biomechanics. We process noisy depth input to obtain spatio-temporallyconsistent 3D mesh reconstructions showing fine-scale muscle bulges over time. Our …,Proceedings of the 10th European Conference on Visual Media Production,2013,4
Monocular Pose Reconstruction for an Augmented Reality Clothing System,Lorenz Rogge; Thomas Neumann; Markus Wacker; Marcus Magnor,Abstract In this paper; we present an approach for realizing an augmented reality system fortry-on of apparel. The core component of our system is a quick human pose estimationalgorithm based on a single camera view only. Due to monocular input data; posereconstruction may be ambiguous. We solve this problem by using a markered suit; thoughnot relying on any specific marker layout. To recover 3D joint angles of the person using thesystem we use Relevance Vector Machine regression with image descriptors that includeneighborhood configurations of visible colored markers and image gradient orientations.This novel combination of image descriptors results in a measurable improvement inreconstruction quality. We initialize and evaluate our algorithm with pose data acquiredusing a motion capture system. As the final step; we simulate a cloth draped around a …,Vision; Modeling; and Visualization (2011),2011,4
High detail marker based 3D reconstruction by enforcing multiview constraints,Thomas Neumann; Markus Wacker; Kiran Varanasi; Christian Theobalt; Marcus Magnor,Abstract We present a 3D reconstruction method enabling high resolution marker-basedcapturing of deforming surfaces. In contrast to previous work; we allow all markers to lookexactly the same and do not rely on temporal tracking. This implies considerableadvantages: markers can be smaller and are easier to apply due to omitted identification;long-range motions normally confusing temporal tracking algorithms become feasible.However; the correct matching of markers between camera views is highly ambiguous insuch a scenario. To solve this problem we propose an optimization framework that considersmultiview conflicts and local smoothness of the captured surface. An iterative relaxationmethod based on graph matching is adopted to obtain a consistent; smooth reconstructionfor all stereo pairs of a multi-camera system simultanously. Preliminary experiments show …,ACM SIGGRAPH 2012 Posters,2012,1
