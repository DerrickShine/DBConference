XMark: A benchmark for XML data management,Albrecht Schmidt; Florian Waas; Martin Kersten; Michael J Carey; Ioana Manolescu; Ralph Busse,This chapter presents the benchmark specifications developed for XMark; a set of queriesand lessons learned while executing the workload specification on a number of platforms.The benchmark was designed top–down; taking the standardization issues around XML asa starting point. The data exchange format XML has been penetrating virtually all areas ofInternet application programming. Thus; electronic commerce sites and content providerswho rely heavily on the new technology are increasingly interested in deploying advanceddata management systems for sites whose data volume exceeds toy sizes. The complexity ofthe challenge has also attracted the attention of the database research community. Earlyefforts mainly concentrated on schema issues and the theory of organizing data without afixed schema; which first seemed incompatible with existing technology. However; as …,*,2002,993
Answering XML Queries on Heterogeneous Data Sources.,Ioana Manolescu; Daniela Florescu; Donald Kossmann,Abstract This work describes an architecture for integrating heterogeneous data sourcesunder an XML global schema; following the local-as-view approach (local sources' schemasare described as views over the global schema). In this context; we focus on the problem oftranslating the user's query against the XML global schema into a SQL query over the localdata sources.,Vldb,2001,476
Integrating keyword search into XML query processing,Daniela Florescu; Donald Kossmann; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract Due to the popularity of the XML data format; several query languages for XMLhave been proposed; specially devised to handle data of which the structure is unknown;loose; or absent. While these languages are rich enough to allow for querying the contentand structure of an XML document; a varying or unknown structure can make formulatingqueries a very difficult task. We propose an extension to XML query languages that enableskeyword search at the granularity of XML elements; that helps novice users formulatequeries; and also yields new optimization opportunities for the query processor. We presentan implementation of this extension on top of a commercial RDBMS; we then discussimplementation choices and performance results.,Computer Networks,2000,352
The XML benchmark project,Albrecht R Schmidt; Florian Waas; Martin L Kersten; Daniela Florescu; Ioana Manolescu; Michael J Carey; Ralph Busse,Abstract With standardization efforts of a query language for XML documents drawing to aclose; researchers and users increasingly focus their attention on the database technologythat has to deliver on the new challenges that the sheer amount of XML documentsproduced by applications pose to data management: validation; performance evaluation andoptimization of XML query processors are the upcoming issues. Following a long tradition indatabase research; the XML Store Benchmark Project provides a framework to assess anXML database''s abilities to cope with a broad spectrum of different queries; typically posedin real-world application scenarios. The benchmark is intended to help both implementorsand users to compare XML databases independent of their own; specific applicationscenario. To this end; the benchmark offers a set queries each of which is intended to …,*,2001,347
Query optimization in the presence of limited access patterns,Daniela Florescu; Alon Levy; Ioana Manolescu; Dan Suciu,Abstract We consider the problem of query optimization in the presence of limitations onaccess patterns to the data (ie; when one must provide values for one of the attributes of arelation in order to obtain tuples). We show that in the presence of limited access patternswe must search a space of annotated query plans; where the annotations describe theinputs that must be given to the plan. We describe a theoretical and experimental analysis ofthe resulting search space and a novel query optimization algorithm that is designed toperform well under the different conditions that may arise. The algorithm searches the set ofannotated query plans; pruning invalid and non-viable plans as early as possible in thesearch space; and it also uses a best-first search strategy in order to produce a first completeplan early in the search. We describe experiments to illustrate the performance of our …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1999,236
Dynamic XML documents with distribution and replication,Serge Abiteboul; Angela Bonifati; Grégory Cobéna; Ioana Manolescu; Tova Milo,Abstract The advent of XML as a universal exchange format; and of Web services as a basisfor distributed computing; has fostered the apparition of a new class of documents: dynamicXML documents. These are XML documents where some data is given explicitly while otherparts are given only intensionally by means of embedded calls to web services that can becalled to generate the required information. By the sole presence of Web services; dynamicdocuments already include inherently some form of distributed computation. A higher levelof distribution that also allows (fragments of) dynamic documents to be distributed and/orreplicated over several sites is highly desirable in today's Web architecture; and in fact isalso relevant for regular (non dynamic) documents. The goal of this paper is to study newissues raised by the distribution and replication of dynamic XML data. Our study has …,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,213
Process modeling in web applications,Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract While Web applications evolve towards ubiquitous; enterprise-wide ormultienterprise information systems; they face new requirements; such as the capability ofmanaging complex processes spanning multiple users and organizations; byinterconnecting software provided by different organizations. Significant efforts are currentlybeing invested in application integration; to support the composition of business processesof different companies; so as to create complex; multiparty business scenarios. In thissetting; Web applications; which were originally conceived to allow the user-to-systemdialogue; are extended with Web services; which enable system-to-system interaction; andwith process control primitives; which permit the implementation of the required businessconstraints.

Active xml: Peer-to-peer data and web services integration,Serge Abiteboul; Omar Benjelloun; Ioana Manolescu; Tova Milo; Roger Weber,The content of an Active eXtensible Markup Language (AXML) document is dynamic;because it is possible to specify when a service call should be activated (for example; whenneeded; every hour; etc.); and for how long its result should be considered valid. Thus; thissimple mechanism allows capturing and combining different styles of data integration; suchas warehousing and mediation. To fully take advantage of the use of services; AXML alsoallows calling continuous services (that provide streams of answers) and servicessupporting intentional data (AXML document including service calls) as parameters and/orresult. The latter feature leads to powerful; recursive integration schemes. The AXMLframework is centered on AXML documents; which are XML documents that may containcalls to Web services.

Model-driven design and deployment of service-enabled web applications,Ioana Manolescu; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Sara Comai; Piero Fraternali,Abstract Significant effort is currently invested in application integration; enabling businessprocesses of different companies to interact and form complex multiparty processes. Webservice standards; based on WSDL (Web Service Definition Language); have been adoptedas process-to-process communication paradigms. However; the conceptual modeling ofapplications using Web services has not yet been addressed. Interaction with Web servicesis often specified at the level of the source code; thus; Web service interfaces are buriedwithin a programmatic specification. In this article; we argue that Web services should beconsidered first-class citizens in the specification of Web applications. Thus; service-enabledWeb applications should benefit from the high-level modeling and automatic codegeneration techniques that have long been advocated for Web application design and …,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT),2005,141
Lazy query evaluation for Active XML,Serge Abiteboul; Omar Benjelloun; Bogdan Cautis; Ioana Manolescu; Tova Milo; Nicoleta Preda,Abstract In this paper; we study query evaluation on Active XML documents (AXML for short);a new generation of XML documents that has recently gained popularity. AXML documentsare XML documents whose content is given partly extensionally; by explicit data elements;and partly intensionally; by embedded calls to Web services; which can be invoked togenerate data. A major challenge in the efficient evaluation of queries over such documentsis to detect which calls may bring data that is relevant for the query execution; and to avoidthe materialization of irrelevant information. The problem is intricate; as service calls may beembedded anywhere in the document; and service invocations possibly return datacontaining calls to new services. Hence; the detection of relevant calls becomes acontinuous process. Also; a good analysis must take the service signatures into …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,133
Agora: Living with XML and relational,Ioana Manolescu; Daniela Florescu; Donald Kossmann; Florian Xhumari; Dan Olteanu,1 Introduction There has been a significant body of research in the last fifteen yearsdedicated to integration of data from various repositories; exhibiting heterogeneous formats;and sometimes access restrictions; for a survey of such systems see; for example;[12]. Themain technical issues to be addressed in a mediation system are: how to semantically unifyheterogeneous data formats and schemas; and how to use query processing capabilities ofparticipant data sites and that of the mediator in order to answer a particular query. Systemslike the Information Manifold; and Garlic from IBM have chosen the relational andrespectively the object-oriented model as the integration model.

Web data management,Serge Abiteboul; Ioana Manolescu; Philippe Rigaux; Marie-Christine Rousset; Pierre Senellart,The Internet and World Wide Web have revolutionized access to information. Users nowstore information across multiple platforms from personal computers to smartphones andwebsites. As a consequence; data management concepts; methods and techniques areincreasingly focused on distribution concerns. Now that information largely resides in thenetwork; so do the tools that process this information. This book explains the foundations ofXML with a focus on data distribution. It covers the many facets of distributed datamanagement on the Web; such as description logics; that are already emerging in today'sdata integration applications and herald tomorrow's semantic Web.

Structured materialized views for XML queries,Andrei Arion; Véronique Benzaken; Ioana Manolescu; Yannis Papakonstantinou,Abstract The performance of XML database queries can be greatly enhanced by rewritingthem using materialized views. We study the problem of rewriting a query using materializedviews; where both the query and the views are described by a tree pattern language;appropriately extended to capture a large XQuery subset. The pattern language featuresoptional nodes and nesting; allowing to capture the data needs of nested XQueries. Thelanguage also allows describing storage features such as structural identifiers; whichenlarge the space of rewritings. We study pattern containment and equivalent rewritingunder the constraints expressed in a structural summary; whose enhanced form also entailsintegrity constraints. Our approach is implemented in the ULoad [7] prototype and wepresent a performance analysis.,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,97
View selection in semantic web databases,François Goasdoué; Konstantinos Karanasos; Julien Leblay; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract We consider the setting of a Semantic Web database; containing both explicit dataencoded in RDF triples; and implicit data; implied by the RDF semantics. Based on a queryworkload; we address the problem of selecting a set of views to be materialized in thedatabase; minimizing a combination of query processing; view storage; and viewmaintenance costs. Starting from an existing relational view selection method; we devisenew algorithms for recommending view sets; and show that they scale significantly beyondthe existing relational ones when adapted to the RDF context. To account for implicit triplesin query answers; we propose a novel RDF query reformulation algorithm and an innovativeway of incorporating it into view selection in order to avoid a combinatorial explosion in thecomplexity of the selection process. The interest of our techniques is demonstrated …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,88
Why and how to benchmark XML databases,Albrecht Schmidt; Florian Waas; Martin Kersten; Daniela Florescu; Michael J Carey; Ioana Manolescu; Ralph Busse,Abstract Benchmarks belong to the very standard repertory of tools deployed in databasedevelopment. Assessing the capabilities of a system; analyzing actual and potentialbottlenecks; and; naturally; comparing the pros and cons of different systems architectureshave become indispensable tasks as databases management systems grow in complexityand capacity. In the course of the development of XML databases the need for a benchmarkframework has become more and more evident: a great many different ways to store XMLdata have been suggested in the past; each with its genuine advantages; disadvantagesand consequences that propagate through the layers of a complex database system andneed to be carefully considered. The different storage schemes render the querycharacteristics of the data variably different. However; no conclusive methodology for …,ACM Sigmod Record,2001,88
RDF in the clouds: a survey,Zoi Kaoudi; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract The Resource Description Framework (RDF) pioneered by the W3C is increasinglybeing adopted to model data in a variety of scenarios; in particular data to be published orexchanged on the Web. Managing large volumes of RDF data is challenging; due to thesheer size; the heterogeneity; and the further complexity brought by RDF reasoning. Totackle the size challenge; distributed storage architectures are required. Cloud computing isan emerging paradigm massively adopted in many applications for the scalability; fault-tolerance; and elasticity feature it provides; enabling the easy deployment of distributed andparallel architectures.

Active xml: A data-centric perspective on web services,Serge Abiteboul; Omar Benjelloun; Ioana Manolescu; Tova Milo; Roger Weber,Summary We propose in this chapter a peer-to-peer architecture that allows for theintegration of distributed data and Web services. It relies on a language; Active XML; wheredocuments embed calls to Web services that are used to enrich them; and new Webservices may be defined by XQuery queries on such active documents. Embedding calls tofunctions or even to Web services inside data is not a new idea. Our contribution; however;is to turn them into a powerful tool for data and services integration. In particular; thelanguage includes linguistic features to control the timing of service call activations. Variousscenarios are captured; such as mediation; data warehousing and distributed computation.A first prototype is also described.,*,2004,78

We identify performance limitations in this context; and propose an array oftechniques to lift them. First; we adapt the DHT platform's index store and communicationprimitives to the needs of massive data processing. Second; we introduce a distributedhierarchical index and associated efficient algorithms to speed up query processing. Third;we present an innovative; XML-specific flavor of Bloom filters; to reduce data transfersentailed by query processing.

The compressed repository stores the compresseddocuments and provides: access methods to this compressed data; and a set ofcompression-specific utilities that enable; eg; the comparison of two compressed values.The query processor optimizes and evaluates XQuery queries over the compresseddocuments. Its complete set of physical operators allows for efficient evaluation over thecompressed repository.

XQueC: A query-conscious compressed XML database,Andrei Arion; Angela Bonifati; Ioana Manolescu; Andrea Pugliese,Abstract XML compression has gained prominence recently because it counters thedisadvantage of the verbose representation XML gives to data. In many applications; suchas data exchange and data archiving; entirely compressing and decompressing a documentis acceptable. In other applications; where queries must be run over compresseddocuments; compression may not be beneficial since the performance penalty in running thequery processor over compressed data outweighs the data compression benefits. Whilebalancing the interests of compression and query processing has received significantattention in the domain of relational databases; these results do not immediately translate toXML data. In this article; we address the problem of embedding compression into XMLdatabases without degrading query performance. Since the setting is rather different from …,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT),2007,64
A framework for distributed XML data management,Serge Abiteboul; Ioana Manolescu; Emanuel Taropa,Abstract As data management applications grow more complex; they may need efficientdistributed query processing; but also subscription management; data archival etc. To enactsuch applications; the current solution consists of stacking several systems together. Thejuxtaposition of different computing models prevents reasoning on the application as awhole; and wastes important opportunities to improve performance. We present a simpleextension to the AXML [7] language; allowing it to declaratively specify and deploy complexapplications based solely on XML and XML queries. Our main contribution is a full algebraicmodel for complex distributed AXML computations. While very expressive; the model isconceptually uniform; and enables numerous powerful optimizations across a distributedcomplex process.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,59

KadoP allows users to build a shared; distributed repository ofresources such as XML documents; semantic information about such documents; Webservices; and collections of such items. KadoP2P builds on distributed hash tables as a peercommunication layer; and ActiveXML as a model for constructing and querying theresources in the peer network.

Efficient query evaluation over compressed XML data,Andrei Arion; Angela Bonifati; Gianni Costa; Sandra d’Aguanno; Ioana Manolescu; Andrea Pugliese,Abstract XML suffers from the major limitation of high redundancy. Even if compression canbe beneficial for XML data; however; once compressed; the data can be seldom browsedand queried in an efficient way. To address this problem; we propose XQueC; an [XQue] ryprocessor and [C] ompressor; which covers a large set of XQuery queries in the compresseddomain. We shred compressed XML into suitable data structures; aiming at both reducingmemory usage at query time and querying data while compressed. XQueC is the first systemto take advantage of a query workload to choose the compression algorithms; and to groupthe compressed data granules according to their common properties. By means ofexperiments; we show that good trade-offs between compression ratio and query capabilitycan be achieved in several real cases; as those covered by an XML benchmark.

Path summaries and path partitioning in modern XML databases,Andrei Arion; Angela Bonifati; Ioana Manolescu; Andrea Pugliese,Abstract XML path summaries are compact structures representing all the simple parent-child paths of an XML document. Such paths have also been used in many works as a basisfor partitioning the document's content in a persistent store; under the form of path indices orpath tables. We revisit the notions of path summaries and path-driven storage model in thecontext of current-day XML databases. This context is characterized by complex queries;typically expressed in an XQuery subset; and by the presence of efficient encodingtechniques such as structural node identifiers. We review a path summary's many uses forquery optimization; and given them a common basis; namely relevant paths. We discusssummary-based tree pattern minimization and present some efficient summary-basedminimization heuristics. We consider relevant path computation and provide a time-and …,World Wide Web,2008,44
MemBeR: a micro-benchmark repository for XQuery,Loredana Afanasiev; Ioana Manolescu; Philippe Michiels,Abstract XQuery is a feature-rich language with complex semantics. This makes it hard tocome up with a benchmark suite which covers all performance-critical features of thelanguage; and at the same time allows one to individually validate XQuery evaluationtechniques. This paper presents MemBeR; a micro-benchmark repository; allowing theevaluation of an XQuery implementation with respect to precise evaluation techniques. Wetake the view that a fixed set of queries is probably insufficient to allow testing for variousperformance aspects; thus; the users of the repository must be able to add new data setsand/or queries for specific performance assessment tasks. We present our methodology forconstructing the micro-benchmark repository; and illustrate with some sample micro-benchmarks.,International XML Database Symposium,2005,44
RDF analytics: lenses over semantic graphs,Dario Colazzo; François Goasdoué; Ioana Manolescu; Alexandra Roatiş,Abstract The development of Semantic Web (RDF) brings new requirements for dataanalytics tools and methods; going beyond querying to semantics-rich analytics throughwarehouse-style tools. In this work; we fully redesign; from the bottom up; core data analyticsconcepts and tools in the context of RDF data; leading to the first complete formal frameworkfor warehouse-style RDF analytics. Notably; we define i) analytical schemas tailored toheterogeneous; semantics-rich RDF graph; ii) analytical queries which (beyond relationalcubes) allow flexible querying of the data and the schema as well as powerful aggregationand iii) OLAP-style operations.

RDF data management in the Amazon cloud,Francesca Bugiotti; François Goasdoué; Zoi Kaoudi; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract Cloud computing has been massively adopted recently in many applications for itselastic scaling and fault-tolerance. At the same time; given that the amount of available RDFdata sources on the Web increases rapidly; there is a constant need for scalable RDF datamanagement tools. In this paper we propose a novel architecture for the distributedmanagement of RDF data; exploiting an existing commercial cloud infrastructure; namelyAmazon Web Services (AWS). We study the problem of indexing RDF data stored withinAWS; by using SimpleDB; a key-value store provided by AWS for small data items. The goalof the index is to efficiently identify the RDF datasets which may have answers for a givenquery; and route the query only to those. We devised and experimented with severalindexing strategies; we discuss experimental results and avenues for future work.,Proceedings of the 2012 Joint EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2012,38

Efficient query answering against dynamic RDF databases,François Goasdoué; Ioana Manolescu; Alexandra Roatiş,Abstract A promising method for efficiently querying RDF data consists of translatingSPARQL queries into efficient RDBMS-style operations. However; answering SPARQLqueries requires handling RDF reasoning; which must be implemented outside therelational engines that do not support it. We introduce the database (DB) fragment of RDF;going beyond the expressive power of previously studied RDF fragments. We devise novelsound and complete techniques for answering Basic Graph Pattern (BGP) queries within theDB fragment of RDF; exploring the two established approaches for handling RDF semantics;namely reformulation and saturation. In particular; we focus on handling database updateswithin each approach and propose a method for incrementally maintaining the saturation;updates raise specific difficulties due to the rich RDF semantics.

Pushing XML queries inside relational databases,Ioana Manolescu; Daniela Florescu; Donald Kossmann,Due to the increasing usage of XML as an exchange format; querying XML documents isalso gaining attention. While several languages exist; work is under way to define the W3Cstandard for an XML query language. To take full advantage of the strength of the RDBMS;XML queries on XML virtual documents need to be translated to SQL queries to be executedby a relational engine. Several existing projects propose mappings between XMLdocuments and relational databases; but the query translation problem from XML queries toSQL queries received less attention. We propose a general method for pushing XML queriesinto a relational database containing the XML document's data. Our solution is general inthat it fits a wide range of mappings between the relational data and the XML documents; itmakes a maximal use of the relational engine query capabilities; and relies on well …,*,2001,35
Efficient XQuery rewriting using multiple views,Ioana Manolescu; Konstantinos Karanasos; Vasilis Vassalos; Spyros Zoupanos,We consider the problem of rewriting XQuery queries using multiple materialized XQueryviews. The XQuery dialect we use to express views and queries corresponds to tree patterns(returning data from several nodes; at different granularities; ranging from node identifiers tofull XML subtrees) with value joins. We provide correct and complete algorithms for findingminimal rewritings; in which no view is redundant. Our work extends the state of the art byconsidering more flexible views than the mostly XPath 1.0 dialects previously considered;and more powerful rewritings. We implemented our algorithms and assess theirperformance through a set of experiments.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,34

In this paper; we present a novel method for XML duplicate detection; called XMLDup.XMLDup uses a Bayesian network to determine the probability of two XML elements beingduplicates; considering not only the information within the elements; but also the way thatinformation is structured. In addition; to improve the efficiency of the network evaluation; anovel pruning strategy; capable of significant gains over the unoptimized version of thealgorithm; is presented. Through experiments; we show that our algorithm is able to achievehigh precision and recall scores in several data sets.

XML Access Modules: Towards Physical Data Independence in XML Databases.,Andrei Arion; Véronique Benzaken; Ioana Manolescu,A key factor for the outstanding success of database management systems is physical dataindependence: queries; and application programs; are able to refer to the data at the logicallevel; ignoring the details on how the data is physically stored and accessed by the system.The corner stone of implementing physical data independence is an access path selectionalgorithm: whenever a disk-resident data item can be accessed in several ways; the accesspath selection algorithm; which is part of the query optimizer; will identify the possiblealternatives; and choose the one likely to provide the best performance for a given query[22]. In the field of XML database management systems (XDBMSs; in short); physical dataindependence remains yet to be achieved. Many XML storage; labeling; and indexingmethods have been proposed so far. However; the data layout produced by a given …,XIME-P,2005,31
Algebra-based identification of tree patterns in XQuery,Andrei Arion; Véronique Benzaken; Ioana Manolescu; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Ravi Vijay,Abstract Query processing performance in XML databases can be greatly enhanced by theusage of materialized views whose content has been stored in the database. This requires amethod for identifying query subexpressions matching the views; a process known as view-based query rewriting. This process is quite complex for relational databases; and all themore daunting on XML databases. Current XML materialized view proposals are based ontree patterns; since query navigation is conceptually close to such patterns. However; theexisting algorithms for extracting tree patterns from XQuery do not detect patterns acrossnested query blocks. Thus; complex; useful tree pattern views may be missed by therewriting algorithm. We present a novel tree pattern extraction algorithm from XQueryqueries; able to identify larger patterns than previous methods. Our algorithm has been …,International Conference on Flexible Query Answering Systems,2006,30

Materialized view selection for XQuery workloads,Asterios Katsifodimos; Ioana Manolescu; Vasilis Vassalos,Abstract The efficient processing of XQuery still poses significant challenges. A particularlyeffective technique to improve XQuery processing performance consists of usingmaterialized views to answer queries. In this work; we consider the problem of choosing thebest views to materialize within a given space budget in order to improve the performance ofa query workload. The paper is the first to address the view selection problem for queriesand views with value joins and multiple return nodes. The challenges we face stem from theexpressive power and features of both the query and view languages and from the size ofthe search space of candidate views to materialize.

Invisible glue: scalable self-tuning multi-stores,Francesca Bugiotti; Damian Bursztyn; Alin Deutsch; Ioana Ileana; Ioana Manolescu,Next-generation data centric applications often involve di-verse datasets; some very largewhile others may be of mod-erate size; some highly structured (eg; relations) while othersmay have more complex structure (eg; graphs) or little structure (eg; text or log data). Facingthem is a variety of storage systems; each of which can host some of the datasets (possiblyafter some data migration); but none of which is likely to be best for all; at all times.Deploying and efficiently running data-centric applications in such a complex setting is verychallenging. We propose Estocada; an architecture for efficiently han-dling highlyheterogeneous datasets based on a dynamic set of potentially very different data stores.Estocada pro-vides to the application/programming layer access to each data set in itsnative format; while hosting them internally in a set of potentially overlapping fragments …,Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR),2015,25
Declarative XML data cleaning with XClean,Melanie Weis; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract Data cleaning is the process of correcting anomalies in a data source; that may forinstance be due to typographical errors; or duplicate representations of an entity. It is acrucial task in customer relationship management; data mining; and data integration. Withthe growing amount of XML data; approaches to effectively and efficiently clean XML areneeded; an issue not addressed by existing data cleaning systems that mostly specialize onrelational data. We present XClean; a data cleaning framework specifically geared towardscleaning XML data. XClean's approach is based on a set of cleaning operators; whosesemantics is well-defined in terms of XML algebraic operators. Users may specify cleaningprograms by combining operators by means of a declarative XClean/PL program; which isthen compiled into XQuery. We describe XClean's operators; language; and compilation …,International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering,2007,25
Query-oriented summarization of RDF graphs,Šejla Čebirić; François Goasdoué; Ioana Manolescu,RDF is the data model of choice for Semantic Web applications. RDF graphs are often largeand heterogeneous; thus users may have a hard time getting familiar with the structure andsemantics of a graph; or determining whether a graph is useful for a certain application. Weconsider answering such questions by inspecting a graph summary; a compact structureconveying as much information as possible about the input graph. A summary isrepresentative of a graph if it represents both its explicit and implicit triples; the latterresulting from RDF Schema constraints. To ensure represen-tativeness; we define a novelRDF-specific summarization framework based on RDF node equivalence and graphquotients; our framework can be instantiated with many different RDF node equivalencerelations. We show that our summaries are representative; and establish a sufficient …,*,2017,24
Towards cost-based optimization for data-intensive web service computations,Nicolaas Ruberg; Gabriela Ruberg; Ioana Manolescu,The recent popularity of XML and Web services has lead to a surge in models and platformsfor distributed XML data management applications. This work investigates performanceissues involved in the deployment of the ActiveXML (AXML) platform for such applications.AXML documents are XML documents; part of which is extensional (present in thedocument); while part is intensional (specified as calls to Web services). Materializing anAXML document thus requires activating all service calls; and gathering the call results inthe document.,*,2004,24
Algebraic incremental maintenance of XML views,Angela Bonifati; Martin Goodfellow; Ioana Manolescu; Domenica Sileo,Abstract Materialized views can bring important performance benefits when querying XMLdocuments. In the presence of XML document changes; materialized views need to beupdated to faithfully reflect the changed document. In this work; we present an algebraicapproach for propagating source updates to XML materialized views expressed in apowerful XML tree pattern formalism. Our approach differs from the state-of-the-art in thearea in two important ways. First; it relies on set-oriented; algebraic operations; to becontrasted with node-based previous approaches. Second; it exploits state-of-the-artfeatures of XML stores and XML query evaluation engines; notably XML structural identifiersand associated structural join algorithms. We present algorithms for determining howupdates should be propagated to views; and highlight the benefits of our approach over …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2013,21
Managing distributed workspaces with active XML,Serge Abiteboul; Jérôme Baumgarten; Angela Bonifati; Gregory Cobena; Cosmin Cremarenco; Florin Dragan; Ioana Manolescu; Tova Milo; Nicoleta Preda,1 Introduction The tremendous evolution of the Web has brought the need for platformsallowing to easily deploy distributed data management applications. The current trend goestowards the de-centralization of such platforms; and in particular to peer-to-peerarchitectures. In this spirit; the Active XML system [1; 2; 3; 7](AXML; for short) provides a peer-to-peer data integration platform; based on Web standards such as XML; and Web services[8]. The system is centered around AXML documents: XML documents where parts of thecontent is explicit XML data; whereas other parts are dynamically generated by calls to Webservices on the same or on other peers. By including Web service calls; AXML documentsalready have an inherent form of distributed computation. A higher level of distribution thatalso allows (fragments of) AXML documents and (some of the) Web services that they use …,Proceedings of the 29th international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 29,2003,21
Growing triples on trees: an XML-RDF hybrid model for annotated documents,François Goasdoué; Konstantinos Karanasos; Yannis Katsis; Julien Leblay; Ioana Manolescu; Stamatis Zampetakis,Abstract Since the beginning of the Semantic Web initiative; significant efforts have beeninvested in finding efficient ways to publish; store; and query metadata on the Web. RDF andSPARQL have become the standard data model and query language; respectively; todescribe resources on the Web. Large amounts of RDF data are now available either asstand-alone datasets or as metadata over semi-structured (typically XML) documents. Theability to apply RDF annotations over XML data emphasizes the need to represent andquery data and metadata simultaneously. We propose XR; a novel hybrid data modelcapturing the structural aspects of XML data and the semantics of RDF; also enabling us toreason about XML data. Our model is general enough to describe pure XML or RDFdatasets; as well as RDF-annotated XML data; where any XML node can act as a …,The VLDB Journal,2013,20
Building large XML stores in the Amazon cloud,Jesús Camacho-Rodríguez; Dario Colazzo; Ioana Manolescu,It has been by now widely accepted that an increasing part of the world's interesting data iseither shared through the Web or directly produced through and for Web platforms usingformats like XML (structured documents). We present a scalable store for managing a largecorpora of XML documents built on top of off-the-shelf cloud infrastructure. We implementdifferent indexing strategies to evaluate a query workload over the stored documents in thecloud. Moreover; each strategy presents different trade-offs between efficiency in queryanswering and cost for storing the index.,Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,20

Efficient querying of distributed resources in mediator systems,Ioana Manolescu; Luc Bouganim; Françoise Fabret; Eric Simon,Abstract This work investigates the integration of heterogeneous resources; such as dataand programs; in a fully distributed peer-to-peer mediation architecture. The challenge inmaking such a system succeed at a large scale is twofold. First; we need a simple conceptfor modeling resources. Second; we need efficient operators for distributed query execution;capable of handling well costly computations and large data transfers. To modelheterogeneous resources; we use the model of table with binding patterns. To exploit aresource with restricted binding patterns; we propose an efficient BindJoin operator;optimized for minimizing large data transfers and costly computations. Furthermore; theproposed BindJoin operator delivers most of its output in the early stages of the execution;which is an important asset in a system meant for human interaction.

Optimizing reformulation-based query answering in RDF,Damian Bursztyn; François Goasdoué; Ioana Manolescu,Reformulation-based query answering is a query processing technique aiming at answeringqueries under constraints. It consists of reformulating the query based on the constraints; sothat evaluating the reformulated query directly against the data (ie; without considering anymore the constraints) produces the correct answer set. In this paper; we consider optimizingreformulation-based query answering in the setting of ontology-based data access; whereSPARQL conjunctive queries are posed against RDF facts on which constraints expressedby an RDF Schema hold. The literature provides query reformulation algorithms for manyfragments of RDF. However; reformulated queries may be complex; thus may not beefficiently processed by a query engine; well established query engines even fail processingthem in some cases.

This paperfocuses on the specification of Web applications that compose Web services in order tosupport arbitrarily complex processes. The proposed approach extends a high-levelmodeling language; called WebML; used for the specification of the front-end of Webapplications.

ULoad: choosing the right storage for your XML application,Andrei Arion; Véronique Benzaken; Ioana Manolescu; Ravi Vijay,Abstract A key factor for the outstanding success of database management systems isphysical data independence: queries; and application programs; are able to refer to the dataat the logical level; ignoring the details on how the data is physically stored and accessed bythe system. The corner stone of implementing physical data independence is an access pathselection algorithm: whenever a disk-resident data item can be accessed in several ways;the access path selection algorithm; which is part of the query optimizer; will identify thepossible alternatives; and choose the one likely to provide the best performance for a givenquery [13].,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,15

A test platform for the INEX heterogeneous track,Serge Abiteboul; Ioana Manolescu; Benjamin Nguyen; Nicoleta Preda,Abstract This article presents our work within the INEX 2004 Heterogeneous Track. Wefocused on taming the structural diversity within the INEX heterogeneous bibliographiccorpus. We demonstrate how semantic models and associated inference techniques can beused to solve the problems raised by the structural diversity within a given XML corpus. Thefirst step automatically extracts a set of concepts from each class of INEX heterogeneousdocuments. An unified set of concepts is then computed; which synthesizes the interestingconcepts from the whole corpus. Individual corpora are connected to the unified set ofconcepts via conceptual mappings. This approach is implemented as an application of theKadoP platform for peer-to-peer warehousing of XML documents.

Towards micro-benchmarking XQuery.,Ioana Manolescu; Cedric Miachon; Philippe Michiels,ABSTRACT A substantial part of the database research field focusses on optimizing XQueryevaluation. However; optimization techniques are rarely validated by means of crossplatform benchmarking. The reason for this is that there is a lack of tools that allows one toeasily compare different implementations of isolated language features. This implies thatthere is no overview of which engines perform best at certain XQuery aspects; which in turnmakes it hard to pick a reference platform for an objective comparison. This paper is a firststep in a larger effort to bring an overview of the available implementations along with theirstrengths and weaknesses. It is meant to guide implementors in benchmarking andimproving their products.,ExpDB,2006,13

Delta: Scalable data dissemination under capacity constraints,Konstantinos Karanasos; Asterios Katsifodimos; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract In content-based publish-subscribe (pub/sub) systems; users express their interestsas queries over a stream of publications. Scaling up content-based pub/sub to very largenumbers of subscriptions is challenging: users are interested in low latency; that is; gettingsubscription results fast; while the pub/sub system provider is mostly interested in scaling; ie;being able to serve large numbers of subscribers; with low computational resourcesutilization. We present a novel approach for scalable content-based pub/sub in the presenceof constraints on the available CPU and network resources; implemented within our pub/subsystem Delta. We achieve scalability by off-loading some subscriptions from the pub/subserver; and leveraging view-based query rewriting to feed these subscriptions from the dataaccumulated in others.

Teaching an RDBMS about ontological constraints,Damian Bursztyn; François Goasdoué; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract In the presence of an ontology; query answers must reflect not only data explicitlypresent in the database; but also implicit data; which holds due to the ontology; even thoughit is not present in the database. A large and useful set of ontology languages enjoys FOLreducibility of query answering: answering a query can be reduced to evaluating a certainfirst-order logic (FOL) formula (obtained from the query and ontology) against only theexplicit facts. We present a novel query optimization framework for ontology-based dataaccess settings enjoying FOL reducibility. Our framework is based on searching within a setof alternative equivalent FOL queries; ie; FOL reformulations; one with minimal evaluationcost when evaluated through a relational database system.

Reformulation-based query answering in RDF: alternatives and performance,Damian Bursztyn; François Goasdoué; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract Answering queries over Semantic Web data; ie; RDF graphs; must account for bothexplicit data and implicit data; entailed by the explicit data and the semantic constraintsholding on them. Two main query answering techniques have been devised; namelySaturation-based (S at) which precomputes and adds to the graph all implicit information;and Reformulation-based (R ef) which reformulates the query based on the graphconstraints; so that evaluating the reformulated query directly against the explicit data (ie;without considering the constraints) produces the query answer. While S at is well known; Ref has received less attention so far. In particular; reformulated queries often perform poorlyif the query is complex.

We provide novelalgorithms showing how to translate such queries into PACT; a recent frameworkgeneralizing MapReduce in particular by supporting many-input tasks. We present the firstformal translation of complex XQuery algebraic expressions into PACT plans; anddemonstrate experimentally the efficiency and scalability of our approach.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,8
Efficient query answering in DL-Lite through FOL reformulation,Damian Bursztyn; François Goasdoué; Ioana Manolescu,We propose a general query optimization framework for formalisms enjoying DL Lite ofquery answering; for which it reduces to the evaluation of a FOL query against facts. Thisframework allows searching within a set of alternative equivalent FOL queries; ie; FOL re-formulations; one with minimal evaluation cost when evaluated through a relationaldatabase management system. We provide two algorithms; an exhaustive and a greedy; forexploring the optimization space. This framework is applied to the lightweight descriptionlogic DL-LiteR underpinning the W3C's OWL2 QL profile; for which an experimentalevaluation validates the interest and applicability of our technique.,28th International Workshop on Description Logics,2015,8
PAXQuery: a massively parallel XQuery processor,Jesús Camacho-Rodríguez; Dario Colazzo; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract We present a novel approach for parallelizing the execution of queries over XMLdocuments; implemented within our system PAXQuery. We compile a rich subset of XQueryinto plans expressed in the PArallelization ConTracts (PACT) programming model. Theseplans are then optimized and executed in parallel by the Stratosphere system. Wedemonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our approach through experiments on hundredsof GB of XML data.,Proceedings of Workshop on Data analytics in the Cloud,2014,7
Materialized view-based processing of RDF queries,François Goasdoué; Konstantinos Karanasos; Julien Leblay; Ioana Manolescu,The increasing interest in the RDF data model has turned the efficient processing of queriesover RDF datasets to a challenging and crucial task. Indeed; the triple format of the RDFdata model; along with the lack of structure that characterizes it; raise new challenges indata management both in terms of performance and scalability. In this paper; we considerimproving the performance of RDF query evaluation by using materialized views. Startingfrom a workload of queries; we describe the space of possible views to materialize; weintroduce ways for assessing the optimality of each view set and we propose practicalalgorithms for exploring the search space. When an RDF Schema is available; our algorithmtakes advantage of it to guarantee the completeness of answering queries. We evaluate theefficiency of our search algorithms and demonstrate the benefits of the materialized views …,Bases de Données Avancées,2010,7

Path Sequence-Based XML Query Processing.,Ioana Manolescu; Andrei Arion; Angela Bonifati; Andrea Pugliese,Abstract We present the path sequence storage model; a new logical model for storing XMLdocuments. This model partitions XML data and content according to the document paths;and uses ordered sequences as logical and physical structures. Besides being verycompact; this model has a strong impact on the efficiency of XQuery evaluation. Its mainadvantages are: fast and selective data access plans; intelligent combination of such plans;based on a summary of the document paths; and intelligent usage of a concise pathsummary.,BDA,2004,7
Getting more RDF support from relational databases,François Goasdoué; Ioana Manolescu; Alexandra Roatiş,Abstract We introduce the database fragment of RDF; which extends the popular DescriptionLogic fragment; in particular with support for incomplete information. We then provide novelsound and complete saturation-and reformulation-based techniques for answering the BasicGraph Pattern queries of SPARQL in this fragment. Notably; we extend the state of the art onpushing RDF query processing within robust/efficient relational database managementsystems. Finally; we experimentally compare our query answering techniques using well-established datasets.,Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on World Wide Web,2012,6
Performance evaluation in database research: principles and experience,Ioana Manolescu; Stefan Manegold,Significant part of today's database research focuses on improving performance of a specificsystem. Quantitative experiments are the best way to validate such results. However;performing experiments is not always easy. Besides the complexity of the system under test;designing an experiment; choosing the right environment and parameter values; analyzingthe data which is gathered; and reporting it to a third party in an expressive and intelligibleway is hard. In this tutorial; we present a general road-map to the above steps; including tipsand tricks on how to organize and present code that performs experiments; so that anoutsider can repeat them. The tutorial is primarily aimed at MS and PhD students seeking toimprove their experiment practices; but more senior attendants may also find it interesting.,12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2009,6
Performance evaluation and experimental assessment: conscience or curse of database research?,Ioana Manolescu; Stefan Manegold,Abstract Performance; performance and performance used to be the three things that reallymattered in database research. Most of our published works indeed include an experimentalevaluation of the proposed techniques. However; such evaluations are sometimes seen asa" must-have" eating up the valuable space where one could describe new ideas.

XML warehousing meets sociology,François-Xavier Dudouet; Ioana Manolescu; Benjamin Nguyen; Pierre Senellart,ABSTRACT In this article; we describe a novel application of XML and Web basedtechnologies: a sociological study of the W3C standardization process. We propose a newmethodology and tools; to be used by sociologists to study the standardization process;illustrated by the W3C XQuery Working Group. The novelty of our approach has many facets.Information Technology (IT) has received little attention from sociologists; yet thestandardization of the Web is a crucial issue; both economical and political; based on theuse of a semi-structured content warehouse. We introduce a modeling and queryingapproach of an XML content warehouse; and show it produces high added-valueinformation. This information is used to conduct a preliminary sociological analysis of theXQuery standardization process.,Proceedings of the IADIS International Conference on the Web and Internet,2005,6

We demonstrate T atooine; a lightweight dataintegration prototype; which allows to quickly set up integration queries across (very)heterogeneous data sources; capitalizing on the many data links (joins) available in thisapplication domain.

Flexible hybrid stores: Constraint-based rewriting to the rescue,Francesca Bugiotti; Damian Bursztyn; Alin Deutsch; Ioana Manolescu; Stamatis Zampetakis,Data management goes through interesting times1; as the number of currently availabledata management systems (DMSs in short) is probably higher than ever before. This leadsto unique opportunities for data-intensive applications; as some systems provide excellentperformance on certain data processing operations. Yet; it also raises great challenges; as asystem efficient on some tasks may perform poorly or not support other tasks; making itimpossible to use a single DMS for a given application. It is thus desirable to use differentDMSs side by side in order to take advantage of their best performance; as advocated underterms such as hybrid or poly-stores.

CliqueSquare in action: Flat plans for massively parallel RDF queries,Benjamin Djahandideh; François Goasdoué; Zoi Kaoudi; Ioana Manolescu; Jorge-Arnulfo Quiané-Ruiz; Stamatis Zampetakis,RDF is an increasingly popular data model for many practical applications; leading to largevolumes of RDF data; efficient RDF data management methods are crucial to allowapplications to scale. We propose to demonstrate CliqueSquare; an RDF data managementsystem built on top of a MapReduce-like infrastructure. The main technical novelty ofCliqueSquare resides in its logical query optimization algorithm; guaranteed to find a logicalplan as flat as possible for a given query; meaning: a plan having the smallest possiblenumber of join operators on top of each other. CliqueSquare's ability to build flat plansallows it to take advantage of a parallel processing framework in order to shorten responsetimes. We demonstrate loading and querying the data; with a particular focus on queryoptimization; and on the performance benefits of CliqueSquare's flat plans.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,5
Cloud-based RDF data management,Zoi Kaoudi; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract The W3C's Resource Description Framework (or RDF; in short) is set to delivermany of the original semi-structured data promises: flexible structure; optional schema; andrich; flexible URIs as a basis for information sharing. Moreover; RDF is uniquely positionedto benefit from the efforts of scientific communities studying databases; knowledgerepresentation; and Web technologies. As a consequence; numerous collections of RDFdata are published; going from scientific data to general-purpose ontologies to opengovernment data; in particular published as part of the Linked Data movement. Managingsuch large volumes of RDF data is challenging; due to the sheer size; the heterogeneity; andthe further complexity brought by RDF reasoning. To tackle the size challenge; distributedstorage architectures are required.

SPARQL Query Processing in the Cloud.,Francesca Bugiotti; Jesús Camacho-Rodríguez; François Goasdoué; Zoi Kaoudi; Ioana Manolescu; Stamatis Zampetakis,Since its emergence; cloud computing has been massively adopted due to the scalability;fault-tolerance and elasticity features it offers. Cloud-based platforms free the applicationdeveloper from the burden of administering the hardware and provide resilience to failures;as well as elastic scaling up and down of resources according to the demand. The recentdevelopment of such environments has a significant impact on the data managementresearch community; in which the cloud provides a distributed; shared-nothing infrastructurefor scalable data storage and processing. Many recent works have focused on theperformance and cost analysis of cloud platforms; and on the extension of the services thatthey provide.

Liquid queries and liquid results in search computing,Alessandro Bozzon; Marco Brambilla; Stefano Ceri; Piero Fraternali; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract Liquid queries are a flexible tool for information seeking; based on the progressiveexploration of the search space; they produce “fluid” results which dynamically adapt to theshape of the query; as a liquid adapts to its container. The liquid query paradigm relies onthe SeCo service mart and multi-domain query execution concepts: an expert user selects apriori the service marts relevant to the information seeking task at hand and the connectionsnecessary to join them; and publishes such a definition in the SeCo back-end. The LiquidQuery client-side interface consumes the application definition created by the expert anddynamically builds a query interface for the end-user. Such interface allows one to supplykeywords to query the pre-configured service marts and offers controls for exploring thecombinations computed by the SeCo execution engine. The interaction commands are …,*,2010,5

Software non-determinism: A software system is non-deterministic if; when re-executed; itresults in a different execution path than a prior execution. Non-determinism can arise when;for example; paths are determined by relative processor speed or the sequence of externalevents. Such software bugs have been called ''Heisenbugs''(hard failures being ''Bohrbugs'').2. Soft hardware failures: Hardware can also suffer from ''Heisenbugs.''For example; atransient hardware failure may be triggered by an environmental cause; such as a cosmicray changing a memory bit; etc. 3. Operator failures: Systems occasionally require operatorintervention. Operators; being human; make mistakes. An operator is unlikely to make thesame mistake at the same point in a subsequent execution.,*,2009,5

Efficient data and program integration using binding patterns,Ioana Manolescu; Luc Bouganim; Françoise Fabret; Eric Simon,In this work; we investigate data and program integration in a fully distribut-ed peer-to-peermediation architecture. The challenge in making such a system succeed at a large scale istwofold. First; sharing a resource should be easy; therefore; we need a simple concept formodeling resources. Second; we need an efficient architecture for distributed queryexecution; capable of handling well costly computations and large data transfers. To modelheterogeneous resources; we propose using the unified abstraction of table with bindingpatterns; simple yet powerful enough to capture data and programs. To exploit a resourcewith restricted binding patterns; we propose an efficient BindJoin operator; following theclassical iterator model; in which we build optimization techniques for minimizing large datatransfers and costly computations; and maximizing parallelism.

Warehousing RDF graphs,Dario Colazzo; François Goasdoué; Ioana Manolescu; Alexandra Roatis,Research in data warehousing (DW) has developed expressive and efficient tools for themultidimensional analysis of large amounts of data. As more data gets produced and sharedin RDF; analytic concepts and tools for analyzing such irregular; graph-shaped; semantic-rich data need to be revisited. We introduce the first all-RDF model for warehousing RDFgraphs. Notably; we define analytical schemas and analytical queries for RDF;corresponding to the relational DW star/snowflake schemas and cubes. We also show howtypical OLAP operations can be performed on our RDF cubes; and experiments on a fully-implemented platform demonstrating the practical interest of our approach.,Bases de Données Avancées,2013,4
Répondre aux requêtes par reformulation dans les bases de données RDF,François Goasdoué; Ioana Manolescu; Alexandra Roatis,Dans RDF; répondre aux requêtes repose soit sur la saturation des données; soit sur lareformulation des requêtes. L'idée des deux techniques est de découpler la notiond'entailment--le mécanisme de raisonnement à partir duquel les réponses aux requêtes sontdéfinies--de l'évaluation de requêtes. Dans cet article; nous étendons l'état de l'art enproposant une technique de réponse aux requêtes par reformulation pour un fragment deRDF plus significatif et un langage de requêtes plus expressif que ceux étudiés dans lalittérature. Nous comparons ensuite expérimentalement cette nouvelle technique avec latechnique standard fondée sur la saturation de données.,RFIA 2012 (Reconnaissance des Formes et Intelligence Artificielle),2012,4
Des triplets sur des arbres: un modele hybride XML-RDF pour documents annotés,François Goasdoué; Konstantinos Karanasos; Yannis Katsis; Julien Leblay; Ioana Manolescu; Stamatis Zampetakis,Une énergie considérable est consacrée à l'enrichissement sémantique de données XMLdu web via des annotations.

LiquidXML: Adaptive XML Content Redistribution,Jesús Camacho-Rodríguez; Asterios Katsifodimos; Ioana Manolescu; Alexandra Roatis,Abstract We propose to demonstrate LiquidXML; a platform for managing large corpora ofXML documents in large-scale P2P networks. All LiquidXML peers may publish XMLdocuments to be shared with all the network peers. The challenge then is to efficiently (re-)distribute the published content in the network; possibly in overlapping; redundantfragments; to support efficient processing of queries at each peer. The novelty of LiquidXMLrelies in its adaptive method of choosing which data fragments are stored where; to improveperformance. The" liquid" aspect of XML management is twofold: XML data flows from manysources towards many consumers; and its distribution in the network continuously adapts toimprove query performance.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,4

OptimAX: optimizing distributed continuous queries,Serge Abiteboul; Ioana Manolescu; Spyros Zoupanos,The system we propose to present; OptiMAX; applies the principles of distributed queryoptimization to the problem of distributed evaluation of continuous XML queries. OptiMAX isan optimizer for Active XML documents (AXML in short). It is implemented as a modulewhich can be used next to an AXML peer; and it may be invoked whenever users askqueries on their AXML documents. The optimizer draws up an initial query plan; and thenattempts to rewrtite it using a combination of heuristics and cost information in order toimprove the plan's performance estimates. An interesting feature is that all plans are AXMLdocuments themselves. When the optimizer has retained a plan; it hands it to the AXMLpeer; which evaluates it directly following the decisions taken by the optimizer.,BDA 2007,2007,4
Social; Structured; and Semantic Search,Raphaël Bonaque; Bogdan Cautis; François Goasdoué; Ioana Manolescu,Social content such as blogs; tweets; news etc. is a rich source of interconnectedinformation. We identify a set of requirements for the meaningful exploitation of such richcontent; and present a new data model; called S3; which is the first to satisfy them. S3captures social relationships between users; and between users and content; but also thestructure present in rich social content; as well as its semantics. We provide the first top-kkeyword search algorithm taking into account the social; structured; and semanticdimensions and formally establish its termination and correctness.

Reasoning on web data: Algorithms and performance,Damian Bursztyn; François Goasdoué; Ioana Manolescu; Alexandra Roatiş,Techniques for efficiently managing Semantic Web data have attracted significant interestfrom the data management and knowledge representation communities. A great deal ofeffort has been invested; especially in the database community; into algorithms and tools forefficient RDF query evaluation. However; the main interest of RDF lies in its blending ofheterogeneous data and semantics. Simple RDF graphs can be seen as collections of facts;which may be further enriched with ontological schemas; or semantic constraints; based onwhich reasoning can be applied to infer new information. Taking into account this implicitinformation is crucial for answering queries.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,3

BGP Query Answering against Dynamic RDF Databases,François Goasdoué; Ioana Manolescu; Alexandra Roatis,A promising method for efficiently querying RDF data consists of translating SPARQLqueries into efficient RDBMS-style operations. However; answering SPARQL queriesrequires handling RDF reasoning; which must be implemented outside the relationalengines that do not support it. We introduce the expressive database (DB) fragment of RDFfor which we devise novel sound and complete techniques for answering Basic GraphPattern (BGP) queries. Our techniques explore the two established approaches for handlingRDF semantics; namely reformulation and saturation; we show how they cope with updates;a complex problem due to the rich RDF semantics.

Currently; subexpressions occurring repeatedly in Pig Latin scripts are executed asmany times as they appear; and the current Pig Latin optimizer does not identify reuseopportunities. We present a novel optimization approach aiming at identifying and reusingrepeated subexpressions in Pig Latin scripts. Our optimization algorithm; named PigReuse;operates on a particular algebraic representation of Pig Latin scripts. PigReuse identifiessubexpression merging opportunities; selects the best ones to execute based on a costfunction; and reuses their results as needed in order to compute exactly the same output asthe original scripts. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.,*,2016,2
How to deal with Cliques at Work,Benjamin Djahandideh; François Goasdoué; Zoi Kaoudi; Ioana Manolescu; Jorge Quiané-Ruiz; Stamatis Zampetakis,RDF is an increasingly popular data model for many practical applications; leading to largevolumes of RDF being created and exploited. Efficient RDF data management methods arecrucial to allow applications to scale. In this demonstration; we showcase the high efficiencyof CliqueSquare; an RDF data management system designed on top of a MapReduce-likeinfrastructure. We demonstrate three major aspects of CliqueSquare:(i) significantly reducingthe network traffic during query evaluation;(ii) evaluating even large queries into fewMapReduce jobs;(iii) improving query performance by producing DAG-shaped plans. In alldemonstration scenarios; the audience is invited to interact with the system to ask queries;explore and control the features of the platform's many optimization algorithms; and finallyselect and monitor the evaluation of plans in two available clusters.,BDA'2014: 30e journées Bases de Données Avancées,2014,2
CliqueSquare: Flat Plans for Massively Parallel RDF Queries,François Goasdoué; Zoi Kaoudi; Ioana Manolescu; Jorge Quiané-Ruiz; Stamatis Zampetakis,As increasing volumes of RDF data are being produced and analyzed; many massivelydistributed architectures have been proposed for storing and querying this data.

XQueC: A Query-Conscious Compressed XML Database (to appear,Andrei Arion; Angela Bonifati; Ioana Manolescu; Andrea Pugliese,Abstract XML compression has gained prominence recently because it counters thedisadvantage of the “verbose” representation XML gives to data. In many applications; suchas data exchange and data archiving; entirely compressing and decompressing a documentis acceptable. In other applications; where queries must be run over compresseddocuments; compression may not be beneficial since the performance penalty in running thequery processor over compressed data outweights the data compression benefits. Whilebalancing the interests of compression and query processing has received significantattention in the domain of relational databases; these results do not immediately translate toXML data.

Implementation of the Active XML Peer for the J2ME platform,Cosmin Cremarenco; Irina Athanasiu; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract Embedded systems become more and more sophisticated. Todays mobile deviceshave the necessary hardware to host complex applications specifically designed takeadvantage of a mobile platform. Subject of this thesis is the implementation of an ActiveXMLpeer [1] whose deployment target is the mobile platform. A classic ActiveXML peer used tobe implemented as a fixed application (as regard to its physical location) and required a lotof computing resources. The most important benefit that arises from using the ActiveXMLtechnology is the ease of managing data placed in physically different locations. TheActiveXML Mobile Peer amplifies this. It makes the location totally transparent and it ought tobe the next evolutionary step in P2P networks.,EMERGING DATABASE RESEARCH IN EAST EUROPE,2003,2

Dagger: Digging for interesting aggregates in RDF graphs,Yanlei Diao; Ioana Manolescu; Shu Shang,RDF is the format of choice for representing Semantic Web data. RDF graphs may be largeand their structure is heterogeneous and complex; making them very hard to explore andunderstand. To help users discover valuable insights from RDF graph; we have developedDagger; a tool which automatically recommends interesting aggregation queries over theRDF graphs; Dagger evaluates the queries and graphically shows their results to the user; inthe ranked order of their interesting-ness. We propose to demonstrate Dagger to the ISWCaudience; based on popular real and synthetic RDF graphs.,International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC),2017,1
A framework for efficient representative summarization of RDF graphs,Šejla Čebirić; François Goasdoué; Ioana Manolescu,RDF is the data model of choice for Semantic Web applications. RDF graphs are often largeand have heterogeneous; complex structure. Graph summaries are compact structurescomputed from the input graph; they are typically used to simplify users' experience and tospeed up graph processing. We introduce a formal RDF summarization framework; basedon graph quotients and RDF node equivalence; our framework can be instantiated withmany such equivalence relations. We show that our summaries represent the structure andsemantics of the input graph; and establish a sufficient condition on the RDF equivalencerelation which ensures that a graph can be summarized more efficiently; without materi-alizing its implicit triples.,*,2017,1
Efficient query answering in the presence of DL-LiteR constraints,Damian Bursztyn; François Goasdoué; Ioana Manolescu,In the presence of an ontology; query answers must reflect not only data explicitly present inthe database; but also implicit data; which holds due to the ontology; even though it is notpresent in the database. A large and useful set of ontology languages enjoys FOLreducibility of query answering; that is: answering a query can be reduced to evaluating acertain first-order logic (FOL) formula (obtained from the query and ontology) against onlythe explicit facts. We present a novel query optimization framework for ontology-based dataaccess settings enjoying FOL reducibility. Our framework is based on searching within a setof alternative equivalent FOL queries; ie; FOL reformulations; one with minimal evaluationcost when evaluated through a relational database system. We apply this framework to theDL-LiteR Description Logic underpinning the W3C's OWL2 QL ontology language; and …,*,2016,1
Understanding and Improving Reformulation-Based Query Answering Performance in RDF,Damian Bursztyn; François Goasdoué; Ioana Manolescu,Answering queries over Semantic Web data; ie; RDF graphs; must account for both explicitand implicit data; entailed by the explicit data and the semantic constraints holding on them.Two main query answering techniques have been devised; namely Saturation-based (Sat)which precomputes and adds to the graph all implicit information; and Reform-ulation-based(Ref) which reformulates the query based on the graph constraints; so that evaluating thereformulated query directly against the explicit data (ie; without considering the constraints)produces the query answer. While Sat is well known; Ref has received less attention so far.In particular; reformulated queries often perform poorly if the query is complex. Ourdemonstration [6] show-cases a large set of Ref techniques; including but not limited to onewe proposed recently [5]. The audience will be able to 1. test them against different …,BDA'15,2015,1

Toward Scalable Hybrid Stores,Francesca Bugiotti; Damian Bursztyn; Alin Deutsch; Ioana Ileana; Ioana Manolescu,Data centric applications often use heterogeneous datasets: some very large while others ofmoderate size; some highly structured (eg; relations) while others complex structured (eg;graphs) or little structured (eg; log data). Facing them is a variety of storage systems butnone of which is the best for all; at all times. We present Estocada; an architecture we arecurrently developing to efficiently handle highly heterogeneous datasets based on adynamic set of potentially very different data stores. Estocada provides to the ap-plicationlayer access to each dataset in its native format; while hosting them internally in a set ofpotentially overlapping fragments; possibly distributed across heterogeneous stores. At thecore of Estocada lie powerful view-based rewriting and view selection algorithms to marrycorrectness with high performance.,SEBD Italian Symposium on Advanced Database Systems,2015,1

As a consequence; optimizing andparallelizing complex analytics XQuery queries is still an open; challenging problem. Wedemonstrate PAXQuery; a novel system that parallelizes the execution of XQuery queriesover large collections of XML documents.

Trading with plans and patterns in XQuery optimization,Andrei Arion; Véronique Benzaken; Ioana Manolescu; Yannis Papakonstantinou,The query optimizer is a central component of a database management system that attemptsto determine the most efficient way to execute a query. During the optimization phase thequery optimizer builds execution plans-(functional) programs that are interpreted by theevaluation engine to produce the query result. The optimizer decides then which of thepossible query plans will be the most efficient in terms in terms of CPU requirements and thenumber of I/O operations. A simplified view of the optimization process for XML queries isdepicted in Figure 1. To process a query expressed in some query language; first; dataaccess plans are built by examining all the possible access paths (eg index scan; sequentialscan) of the existing storage modules; views and indices.

Dynamic XML Documents with Distribution and Replication,Serge Abiteboul Angela Bonifati Grégory Cobéna; Ioana Manolescu; Tova Milo,ABSTRACT The advent of XML as a universal exchange format and of Web services as abasis for distributed computing; has fostered the apparition of a new class of documents:dynamic XML documents. These are XML documents where some of the data is givenexplicitly while other parts are given only intentionally by means of embedded calls to webservices; that can be called to generate the required information. By the sole presence ofWeb services; dynamic documents already include inherently some form of distributedcomputation. A higher level of distribution that also allows (fragments of) dynamicdocuments to be distributed and/or replicated over several sites is highly desirable in today'sWeb architecture; and in fact is also relevant for regular (non dynamic) documents.

Database Optimization Techniques for Semantic Queries,Ioana Manolescu,Techniques for efficiently managing Semantic Web data have attracted significant interestfrom the data management and knowledge representation communities. In particular; asRDF is the most widely used model for Semantic Web data; a great deal of effort has beeninvested; especially in the database community; into algorithms and tools for efficient RDFquery evaluation. Semantic Web data can be seen as a colection of facts enriched withontological schemas; or semantic constraints; based on which reasoning can be applied toinfer new information. Taking into account this implicit information is required in order toproduce complete answers to queries. The difficulty in doing so depends on the expressivepower of the constraints being used to describe the semantics of the data.

Extended query language and composition for the XR data model,Alin Deutsch; François Goasdoué; Julien Leblay; Ioana Manolescu,The XR data model allows capturing rich semistructured corpora of documents (XML) withannotations (RDF triples). A simple query language for XR was presented in previous work;which allowed to retrieve results from from XR databases but not to build new XR content.This work makes two contributions. First; we present an extension of the query languagegiving powerful content structuring and grouping capabilities which enables flexiblegeneration of new XR results. Second; we provide a query-view composition algorithmwhich enables the efficient evaluation of XR queries over previously defined XR views.,*,2013,*
Index selection for NoSQL databases in the cloud,François Goasdoué; Ioana Manolescu,Context Over the last few years; interest in very large-scale data management has explodedand as a consequence; existing tools and techniques have been found severaly lacking inseveral respects. First; traditional database servers are very suited for regular-structure data;but are poor at handling heterogeneous or partially structured data. Second; even thoughdatabase servers have reach scalability degrees sufficient to power any branch of modernbusiness today; they have been built on strong transactional guarantees; which limit theirsuccess on massively parallel installations; such as those backed by parallel programmingframeworks and in particular MapReduce [5]. In this context; a new breed of systems hasseen the day; broadly labeled as “NoSQL”.

Algebraic Techniques for XML View Maintenance,Angela Bonifati; Martin Goodfellow; Ioana Manolescu; Domenica Sileo; Domenica Sileo Algebraic Incremental; Inria Links,Materialized views can bring important performance benefits when querying XMLdocuments. In the presence of XML document changes; materialized views need to beupdated to faithfully reflect the changed document. In this work; we present an algebraicapproach for propagating source updates to XML materialized views expressed in apowerful XML tree pattern formalism. Our approach differs from the state of the art in the areain two important ways. First; it relies on set-oriented; algebraic operations; to be contrastedwith node-based previous approaches. Second; it exploits state-of-the-art features of XMLstores and XML query evaluation engines; notably XML structural identifiers and associatedstructural join algorithms. We present algorithms for determining how updates should bepropagated to views; and highlight the benefits of our approach over existing algorithms …,*,2013,*

View Selection in Semantic Web Databases,François Goasdoué—Konstantinos Karanasos—Julien Leblay; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract: We consider the setting of a Semantic Web database; containing both explicit dataencoded in RDF triples; and implicit data; implied by the RDF semantics. Based on a queryworkload; we address the problem of selecting a set of views to be materialized in thedatabase; minimizing a combination of query processing; view storage; and viewmaintenance costs. Starting from an existing relational view selection method; we devisenew algorithms for recommending view sets; and show that they scale significantly beyondthe existing relational ones when adapted to the RDF context. To account for implicit triplesin query answers; we propose a novel RDF query reformulation algorithm and an innovativeway of incorporating it into view selection in order to avoid a combinatorial explosion in thecomplexity of the selection process. The interest of our techniques is demonstrated …,*,2011,*
Provenance Management in the EdiFlow VA Workflow,Jean-Daniel Fekete; Wael Khemiri; Ioana Manolescu; Véronique Benzaken,Most visual analytics platforms are memory-based and are therefore limited in the volume ofdata handled. Moreover; the integration of each new algorithm (eg for clustering) requiresintegrating it by hand into the platform. Finally; they lack the capability to define and deploywell-structured processes where users with different roles interact in a coordinated waysharing the same data and possibly the same visualizations. We have designed andimplemented EdiFlow; a workflow platform for visual analytics applications. EdiFlow uses asimple structured process model and is backed by a persistent database; storing bothprocess information and process instance data. We are now adding ProvenanceManagement in EdiFlow since the workflow manager already maintains a rough provenanceinformation from the structure of the modules.

Often times; theowner of the road network data (eg; a transport authority) provides its database to third-partyquery services; which are responsible for answering shortest path queries posed by theirclients. The issue arising here is that a query service might be returning sub-optimal pathseither purposely (in order to serve its own purposes like computational savings orcommercial reasons) or because it has been compromised by Internet attackers who falsifythe results.

We present the ViP2 approach (standing for views inpeer-to-peer) for disseminating and efficiently querying XML data. ViP2P is built on top of astructured P2P network; and allows each peer to subscribe to XML query results. Moreover;ViP2P provides efficient mechanisms to process queries in snapshot mode; re-using theresults of continuous queries stored on the other peers. We show how ViP2P generalizesand other previous XML data management models for P2P networks and conclude by ashort demo of the system.,école thématique BDA,2010,*

Adaptive distributed XML views,Asterios Katsifodimos; Ioana Manolescu; Alin Tilea; Spyros Zoupanos,We consider the problem of efficiently managing large corpora of XML documents in adistributed; decentralized setting involving hundreds of machines (or peers). We assumedistributed users are willing to share their data. Thus; on any network peer; users mayestablish long-running subscriptions; by means of declarative queries over the entire currentand future data. Thus; XML data is “liquid”: it comes from many sources and flows towards itsconsumers. Moreover; data accumulating at a peer as a result of a subscription is seen as amaterialized view over the whole network; and can be used to answer other queries. Wehave developed ViP2P; a fully functional system implementing these ideas. We describe thearchitecture and the algorithms behind it; as well as experiments on hundreds of machinesdistributed in a LAN; in [7]. In this report; we consider the issue of adapting the …,*,2009,*

In XQueC; data items areaggregated into containers; which are further grouped to be compressed together. This way;XQueC is able to exploit data commonalities and to perform query evaluation in thecompressed domain; with the aim of improving both compression and queryingperformance. However; different compression algorithms have different performance andsupport different sets of operations in the compressed domain. Therefore; choosing how togroup containers and which compression algorithm to apply to each group is a challengingissue.

XQueC;namely XQuery processor and Compressor; is the first compression tool to seamlessly allowXQuery queries in the compressed domain. It includes a set of data structures; that basicallyshred the XML document into suitable chunks linked to each other; thus disagreeing withthe'homomorphic'principle so far adopted in previous XML compressors. According to thisprinciple; the compressed document is homomorphic to the original document. Moreover; inorder to avoid the time consumption due to compressing and decompressing intermediatequery results; XQueC applies 'lazy'decompression by issuing the queries directly in thecompressed domain.,Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings,2008,*

This requires a methodfor identifying query subexpressions matching the views; a process known as view-basedquery rewriting. This process is quite complex for relational databases; and all the moredaunting on XML databases. Current XML materialized view proposals are based on treepatterns; since query navigation is conceptually close to such patterns. However; theexisting algorithms for extracting tree patterns from XQuery do not detect patterns {\emacross nested query blocks}. Thus; complex; useful tree pattern views may be missed by therewriting algorithm.

SPECIFICATION AND DESIGN OF WORKFLOW-DRIVEN HYPERTEXTSa,Marco Brambilla Stefano Ceri Sara Comai; Piero Fraternali; Ioana Manolescu,While the Web consolidates as the ubiquitous application delivery platform; the features ofWeb applications evolve to cover new requirements; like the capability of managing complexworkflows spanning multiple users and organizations. This scenario challenges the Webengineering methods to address a broader class of applications. This paper introducesworkflow-driven hypertexts; defined as Web-enabled hypertextual applications serving theworkflow of multiple users; and proposes a design method integrating data; hypertext; andworkflow modeling concepts for modeling lightweight Webenabled workflows; this approachextends the benefits of high-level conceptual modeling and automatic code generation to amuch broader class of Web applications.,Journal of Web Engineering,2002,*

We study the problem of RDF graph summarization: given aninput RDF graph G; find an RDF graph SG which summarizes G as accurately as possible;while being possibly orders of magnitude smaller than the original graph. Our summariesare aimed as a help for query formulation and optimization; in particular; querying asummary of a graph should reflect whether the query has some answers against this graph.We introduce two summaries: a baseline which is compact and simple and satisfies certainaccuracy and representativeness properties; but may oversimplify the RDF graph; and arefined one which trades some of these properties for more accuracy in representing thestructure. The demonstration will allow the audience to compute such summaries out of a …,*,*,*

We present a novel optimization approach aiming at identifying andreusing repeated subexpressions in Pig Latin scripts. Our optimization algorithm; namedPigReuse; identifies subexpression merging opportunities; selects the best ones to executebased on a cost function; and reuses their results as needed in order to compute exactly thesame output as the original scripts.

Cost-based logical optimization for DAG plans of reformulated queries,Damian Bursztyn; François Goasdoué; Ioana Manolescu; Alessandro Solimando; Michaël Thomazo,Query answering in presence of semantic constraints must cope with both explicit andimplicit data. Two families of query answering techniques have been proposed in literature;namely Saturation-based; which adds all the implicit knowledge to the explicit graph; that isthen queried in a classical way; and Reformulation-based; which does not alter the set ofexplicit data; but reformulates the original query under the given contraints in such a waythat ensure completeness also wrt implicit knowledge. Different reformulation algorithmshave been proposed in literature. Union of conjunctive queries (UCQ) reformulation [6; 10; 8;11; 4; 1; 5; 3; 7] applies to various fragments of RDF; ranging from the Description Logics(DL) one up to the Database (DB) one. Another notable reformulation technique computessemi-conjunctive queries (SCQ) reformulations [9] and can be applied to the DL fragment …,*,*,*
Exploratory Analytics for RDF Data,Yanlei Diao; Ioana Manolescu,Context: RDF and the Semantic Web The “Web of Data” vision behind the initial World WideWeb project has found its most recent incarnation through the Semantic Web. More andmore data sources are being exported or produced as triples; using the ResourceDescription Format (or RDF; in short) model standardized by the W3C [3]. To exploit thiswealth of data; the SPARQL query language has been defined [4]; and recently enriched tosupport complex querying using regular path expressions; grouping and aggregation etc.RDF graph structure tends to be complex. In a given graph; different resources may havedifferent sets of properties; a given property may have zero; one or several values; resourcesmay or may not have types. This makes it difficult for users to get acquainted with the contentand structure of a large RDF graph.,*,*,*
