Probabilistic frequent itemset mining in uncertain databases,Thomas Bernecker; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Florian Verhein; Andreas Zuefle,Abstract Probabilistic frequent itemset mining in uncertain transaction databasessemantically and computationally differs from traditional techniques applied to standard"certain" transaction databases. The consideration of existential uncertainty of item (sets);indicating the probability that an item (set) occurs in a transaction; makes traditionaltechniques inapplicable. In this paper; we introduce new probabilistic formulations offrequent itemsets based on possible world semantics. In this probabilistic context; an itemsetX is called frequent if the probability that X occurs in at least minSup transactions is above agiven threshold τ. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first approach addressing thisproblem under possible worlds semantics. In consideration of the probabilistic formulations;we present a framework which is able to solve the Probabilistic Frequent Itemset Mining …,Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2009,280
Probabilistic nearest-neighbor query on uncertain objects,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peter Kunath; Matthias Renz,Abstract Nearest-neighbor queries are an important query type for commonly used featuredatabases. In many different application areas; eg sensor databases; location basedservices or face recognition systems; distances between objects have to be computed basedon vague and uncertain data. A successful approach is to express the distance between twouncertain objects by probability density functions which assign a probability value to eachpossible distance value. By integrating the complete probabilistic distance function as awhole directly into the query algorithm; the full information provided by these functions isexploited. The result of such a probabilistic query algorithm consists of tuples containing theresult object and a probability value indicating the likelihood that the object satisfies t hequery predicate. In this paper we introduce an efficient strategy for processing …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,168
A generic framework for efficient subspace clustering of high-dimensional data,H-P Kriegel; Peer Kroger; Matthias Renz; Sebastian Wurst,Subspace clustering has been investigated extensively since traditional clusteringalgorithms often fail to detect meaningful clusters in high-dimensional data spaces. Manyrecently proposed subspace clustering methods suffer from two severe problems: First; thealgorithms typically scale exponentially with the data dimensionality and/or the subspacedimensionality of the clusters. Second; for performance reasons; many algorithms use aglobal density threshold for clustering; which is quite questionable since clusters insubspaces of significantly different dimensionality will most likely exhibit significantly varyingdensities. In this paper; we propose a generic framework to overcome these limitations. Ourframework is based on an efficient filter-refinement architecture that scales at most quadraticwrt the data dimensionality and the dimensionality of the subspace clusters. It can be …,Data Mining; Fifth IEEE International Conference on,2005,148
Efficient reverse k-nearest neighbor search in arbitrary metric spaces,Elke Achtert; Christian Böhm; Peer Kröger; Peter Kunath; Alexey Pryakhin; Matthias Renz,Abstract The reverse k-nearest neighbor (RkNN) problem; ie finding all objects in a data setthe k-nearest neighbors of which include a specified query object; is a generalization of thereverse 1-nearest neighbor problem which has received increasing attention recently. Manyindustrial and scientific applications call for solutions of the RkNN problem in arbitrary metricspaces where the data objects are not Euclidean and only a metric distance function is givenfor specifying object similarity. Usually; these applications need a solution for thegeneralized problem where the value of k is not known in advance and may change fromquery to query. However; existing approaches; except one; are designed for the specificR1NN problem. In addition-to the best of our knowledge-all previously proposed methods;especially the one for generalized RkNN search; are only applicable to Euclidean vector …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,144
Probabilistic similarity join on uncertain data,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peter Kunath; Martin Pfeifle; Matthias Renz,Abstract An important database primitive for commonly used feature databases is thesimilarity join. It combines two datasets based on some similarity predicate into one set suchthat the new set contains pairs of objects of the two original sets. In many differentapplication areas; eg sensor databases; location based services or face recognitionsystems; distances between objects have to be computed based on vague and uncertaindata. In this paper; we propose to express the similarity between two uncertain objects byprobability density functions which assign a probability value to each possible distancevalue. By integrating these probabilistic distance functions directly into the join algorithmsthe full information provided by these functions is exploited. The resulting probabilisticsimilarity join assigns to each object pair a probability value indicating the likelihood that …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2006,122
Stable haptic interaction with virtual environments using an adapted voxmap-pointshell algorithm,Matthias Renz; Carsten Preusche; Marco Pötke; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Gerd Hirzinger,Abstract Despite a lot of research in recent years stable and realistic haptic interaction withvirtual environments keeps an unsolved problem. Among different approaches the Voxmap-PointShell TM (VPS) method seems very promising due to constant sample rates;independent of the static environment. But there is still the stability problem to be solvedglobally. In this paper some adaptations based on the VPS are presented; including thedynamic object modeling and the force calculation method; to reduce the distractions of thecalculated collision forces to increase stability. The PointShell points lie exactly on thesurface of the dynamic object; to get a smoother surface representation. A variation of thecollision force calculation leads to a reduction of the “voxel noise”; that appears due to thediscretization of the volume space. A design framework for the virtual coupling is …,In Proc. Eurohaptics,2001,106
Route skyline queries: A multi-preference path planning approach,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Matthias Schubert,In recent years; the research community introduced various methods for processing skylinequeries in multidimensional databases. The skyline operator retrieves all objects beingoptimal wrt an arbitrary linear weighting of the underlying criteria. The most prominentexample query is to find a reasonable set of hotels which are cheap but close to the beach.In this paper; we propose an new approach for computing skylines on routes (paths) in aroad network considering multiple preferences like distance; driving time; the number oftraffic lights; gas consumption; etc. Since the consideration of different preferences usuallyinvolves different routes; a skyline-fashioned answer with relevant route candidates is highlyuseful. In our work; we employ graph embedding techniques to enable a best-first basedgraph exploration considering route preferences based on arbitrary road attributes.

Similarity search on time series based on threshold queries,Johannes Aßfalg; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Peter Kunath; Alexey Pryakhin; Matthias Renz,Abstract Similarity search in time series data is required in many application fields. The mostprominent work has focused on similarity search considering either complete time series orsimilarity according to subsequences of time series. For many domains like financialanalysis; medicine; environmental meteorology; or environmental observation; the detectionof temporal dependencies between different time series is very important. In contrast totraditional approaches which consider the course of the time series for the purpose ofmatching; coarse trend information about the time series could be sufficient to solve theabove mentioned problem. In particular; temporal dependencies in time series can bedetected by determining the points of time at which the time series exceeds a specificthreshold. In this paper; we introduce the novel concept of threshold queries in time series …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,84
Querying uncertain spatio-temporal data,Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Andreas Zufle,The problem of modeling and managing uncertain data has received a great deal of interest;due to its manifold applications in spatial; temporal; multimedia and sensor databases.There exists a wide range of work covering spatial uncertainty in the static (snapshot) case;where only one point of time is considered. In contrast; the problem of modeling andquerying uncertain spatio-temporal data has only been treated as a simple extension of thespatial case; disregarding time dependencies between consecutive timestamps. In this work;we present a framework for efficiently modeling and querying uncertain spatio-temporaldata. The key idea of our approach is to model possible object trajectories by stochasticprocesses. This approach has three major advantages over previous work. First it allowsanswering queries in accordance with the possible worlds model.

Reverse k-nearest neighbor search in dynamic and general metric databases,Elke Achtert; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle,Abstract In this paper; we propose an original solution for the general reverse k-nearestneighbor (RkNN) search problem. Compared to the limitations of existing methods for theRkNN search; our approach works on top of any hierarchically organized tree-like indexstructure and; thus; is applicable to any type of data as long as a metric distance function isdefined on the data objects. We will exemplarily show how our approach works on top of themost prevalent index structures for Euclidean and metric data; the R-Tree and the M-Tree;respectively. Our solution is applicable for arbitrary values of k and can also be applied indynamic environments where updates of the database frequently occur. Although being themost general solution for the RkNN problem; our solution outperforms existing methods interms of query execution times because it exploits different strategies for pruning false …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,59
Statistical density prediction in traffic networks,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Matthias Schubert; Andreas Zuefle,Abstract Recently; modern tracking methods started to allow capturing the position ofmassive numbers of moving objects. Given this information; it is possible to analyze andpredict the traffic density in a network which offers valuable information for traffic control;congestion prediction and prevention. In this paper; we propose a novel statistical approachto predict the density on any edge of such a network at some time in the future. Our methodis based on short-time observations of the traffic history. Therefore; knowing the destinationof each traveling individual is not required. Instead; we assume that the individuals will actrationally and choose the shortest path from their starting points to their destinations. Basedon this assumption; we introduce a statistical approach to describe the likelihood of anygiven individual in the network to be located at a certain position at a certain time. Since …,*,2008,55
Efficient probabilistic reverse nearest neighbor query processing on uncertain data,Thomas Bernecker; Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Stefan Zankl; Andreas Züfle,Abstract Given a query object q; a reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) query in a commoncertain database returns the objects having q as their nearest neighbor. A new challenge fordatabases is dealing with uncertain objects. In this paper we consider probabilistic reversenearest neighbor (PRNN) queries; which return the uncertain objects having the queryobject as nearest neighbor with a sufficiently high probability. We propose an algorithm forefficiently answering PRNN queries using new pruning mechanisms taking distancedependencies into account. We compare our algorithm to state-of-the-art approachesrecently proposed. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach is able tosignificantly outperform previous approaches.

Probabilistic similarity search for uncertain time series,Johannes Aßfalg; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Matthias Renz,Abstract A probabilistic similarity query over uncertain data assigns to each uncertaindatabase object oa probability indicating the likelihood that o meets the query predicate. Inthis paper; we formalize the notion of uncertain time series and introduce two novel andimportant types of probabilistic range queries over uncertain time series. Furthermore; wepropose an original approximate representation of uncertain time series that can be used toefficiently support both new query types by upper and lower bounding the Euclideandistance.,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2009,49
Hierarchical graph embedding for efficient query processing in very large traffic networks,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Matthias Renz; Tim Schmidt,Abstract We present a novel graph embedding to speed-up distance-range and k-nearestneighbor queries on static and/or dynamic objects located on a (weighted) graph that isapplicable also for very large networks. Our method extends an existing embedding calledreference node embedding which can be used to compute accurate lower and upperbounding filters for the true shortest path distance. In order to solve the problem of highstorage cost for the network embedding; we propose a novel concept called hierarchicalembedding that scales well to very large traffic networks. Our experimental evaluation onseveral real-world data sets demonstrates the benefits of our proposed concepts; ie efficientquery processing and reduced storage cost; over existing work.,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2008,46
Boosting spatial pruning: on optimal pruning of MBRs,Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle,Abstract Fast query processing of complex objects; eg spatial or uncertain objects; dependson efficient spatial pruning of objects' approximations; which are typically minimumbounding rectangles (MBRs). In this paper; we propose a novel effective and efficientcriterion to determine the spatial topology between multi-dimensional rectangles. Giventhree rectangles R; A; and B; in a multi-dimensional space; the task is to determine whetherA; is definitely closer to R; than B. This domination relation is used in many applications toperform spatial pruning. Traditional techniques apply spatial pruning based on minimal andmaximal distance. These techniques however show significant deficiencies in terms ofeffectivity. We prove that our decision criterion is correct; complete; and efficient to computeeven for high dimensional databases.

Scalable probabilistic similarity ranking in uncertain databases,Thomas Bernecker; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Andreas Zuefle,This paper introduces a scalable approach for probabilistic top-k similarity ranking onuncertain vector data. Each uncertain object is represented by a set of vector instances thatis assumed to be mutually exclusive. The objective is to rank the uncertain data according totheir distance to a reference object. We propose a framework that incrementally computesfor each object instance and ranking position; the probability of the object falling at thatranking position. The resulting rank probability distribution can serve as input for severalstate-of-the-art probabilistic ranking models. Existing approaches compute this probabilitydistribution by applying the Poisson binomial recurrence technique of quadratic complexity.In this paper; we theoretically as well as experimentally show that our framework reducesthis to a linear-time complexity while having the same memory requirements; facilitated by …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2010,41
Probabilistic nearest neighbor queries on uncertain moving object trajectories,Johannes Niedermayer; Andreas Züfle; Tobias Emrich; Matthias Renz; Nikos Mamoulis; Lei Chen; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract Nearest neighbor (NN) queries in trajectory databases have received significantattention in the past; due to their applications in spatio-temporal data analysis. More recentwork has considered the realistic case where the trajectories are uncertain; however; onlysimple uncertainty models have been proposed; which do not allow for accurateprobabilistic search. In this paper; we fill this gap by addressing probabilistic nearestneighbor queries in databases with uncertain trajectories modeled by stochastic processes;specifically the Markov chain model. We study three nearest neighbor query semantics thattake as input a query state or trajectory q and a time interval; and theoretically evaluate theirruntime complexity. Furthermore we propose a sampling approach which uses Bayesianinference to guarantee that sampled trajectories conform to the observation data stored in …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,40
A novel probabilistic pruning approach to speed up similarity queries in uncertain databases,Thomas Bernecker; Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle,In this paper; we propose a novel; effective and efficient probabilistic pruning criterion forprobabilistic similarity queries on uncertain data. Our approach supports a generaluncertainty model using continuous probabilistic density functions to describe the (possiblycorrelated) uncertain attributes of objects. In a nutshell; the problem to be solved is tocompute the PDF of the random variable denoted by the probabilistic domination count:Given an uncertain database object B; an uncertain reference object R and a set D ofuncertain database objects in a multi-dimensional space; the probabilistic domination countdenotes the number of uncertain objects in D that are closer to R than B. This dominationcount can be used to answer a wide range of probabilistic similarity queries.

Proximity queries in large traffic networks,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Peter Kunath; Matthias Renz; Tim Schmidt,Abstract In this paper; we present an original network graph embedding to speed-updistance-range and k-nearest neighbor queries in (weighted) graphs. Our approachimplements the paradigm of filter-refinement query processing and can be used for proximityqueries on both static as well as dynamic objects. In particular; we present how ourembedding can be used to compute a lower and upper bounding filter distance whichapproximates the true shortest path distance significantly better than traditional filters; eg theEuclidean distance. These distance approximations can be used within a filter step to prunetrue drops and true hits as well as in the refinement step in order to guide an informed A*search. Our experimental evaluation on several real-world data sets demonstrates asignificant performance boosting of our proposed concepts over existing work.,Proceedings of the 15th annual ACM international symposium on Advances in geographic information systems,2007,31
Generalizing the optimality of multi-step k-nearest neighbor query processing,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Peter Kunath; Matthias Renz,Abstract Similarity search algorithms that directly rely on index structures and require a lot ofdistance computations are usually not applicable to databases containing complex objectsand defining costly distance functions on spatial; temporal and multimedia data. Rather; theuse of an adequate multi-step query processing strategy is crucial for the performance of asimilarity search routine that deals with complex distance functions. Reducing the number ofcandidates returned from the filter step which then have to be exactly evaluated in therefinement step is fundamental for the efficiency of the query process. The state-of-the-artmulti-step k-nearest neighbor (k NN) search algorithms are designed to use only a lowerbounding distance estimation for candidate pruning. However; in many applications; also anupper bounding distance approximation is available that can additionally be used for …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2007,30
Voronoi-based nearest neighbor search for multi-dimensional uncertain databases,Peiwu Zhang; Reynold Cheng; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle; Yu Tang; Tobias Emrich,In Voronoi-based nearest neighbor search; the Voronoi cell of every point p in a databasecan be used to check whether p is the closest to some query point q. We extend the notion ofVoronoi cells to support uncertain objects; whose attribute values are inexact. Particularly;we propose the Possible Voronoi cell (or PV-cell). A PV-cell of a multi-dimensional uncertainobject o is a region R; such that for any point pϵR; o may be the nearest neighbor of p. If thePV-cells of all objects in a database S are known; they can be used to identify objects thathave a chance to be the nearest neighbor of q. However; there is no efficient algorithm forcomputing an exact PV-cell. We hence study how to derive an axis-parallel hyper-rectangle(called the Uncertain Bounding Rectangle; or UBR) that tightly contains a PV-cell.

Indexing uncertain spatio-temporal data,Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle,Abstract The advances in sensing and telecommunication technologies allow the collectionand management of vast amounts of spatio-temporal data combining location and timeinformation. Due to physical and resource limitations of data collection devices (eg; RFIDreaders; GPS receivers and other sensors) data are typically collected only at discrete pointsof time. In-between these discrete time instances; the positions of tracked moving objects areuncertain. In this work; we propose novel approximation techniques in order toprobabilistically bound the uncertain movement of objects; these techniques allow forefficient and effective filtering during query evaluation using an hierarchical index structure.To the best of our knowledge; this is the first approach that supports query evaluation onvery large uncertain spatio-temporal databases; adhering to possible worlds semantics …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,29
Probabilistic frequent pattern growth for itemset mining in uncertain databases,Thomas Bernecker; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Florian Verhein; Andreas Züfle,Abstract Frequent itemset mining in uncertain transaction databases semantically andcomputationally differs from traditional techniques applied on standard (certain) transactiondatabases. Uncertain transaction databases consist of sets of existentially uncertain items.The uncertainty of items in transactions makes traditional techniques inapplicable. In thispaper; we tackle the problem of finding probabilistic frequent itemsets based on possibleworld semantics. In this context; an itemset X is called frequent if the probability that X occursin at least minSup transactions is above a given threshold τ. We make the followingcontributions: We propose the first probabilistic FP-Growth algorithm (ProFP-Growth) andassociated probabilistic FP-tree (ProFP-tree); which we use to mine all probabilistic frequentitemsets in uncertain transaction databases without candidate generation.

Approximated clustering of distributed high-dimensional data,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peter Kunath; Martin Pfeifle; Matthias Renz,Abstract In many modern application ranges high-dimensional feature vectors are used tomodel complex real-world objects. Often these objects reside on different local sites. In thispaper; we p resent a general approach for extracting knowledge out of distributed data setswithout transmitting all data from the local clients to a server site. In order to keep thetransmission cost low; we first determine suitable local feature vector approximations whichare sent to the server. Thereby; we approximate each feature vector as precisely as possiblewith a specified number of bytes. In order to extract knowledge out of these approximations;we introduce a suitable distance function between the feature vector approximations.

This paperdefines and studies inverse spatial queries; which; given a subset of database objects Q anda query predicate; return all objects which; if used as query objects with the predicate;contain Q in their result. We first show a straightforward solution for answering inversespatial queries for any query predicate. Then; we propose a filter-and-refinement frameworkthat can be used to improve efficiency.

Reverse-nearest neighbor queries on uncertain moving object trajectories,Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Johannes Niedermayer; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle,Abstract Reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) queries in spatial and spatio-temporal databaseshave received significant attention in the database research community over the lastdecade. A reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) query finds the objects having a given queryobject as its nearest neighbor. RNN queries find applications in data mining; marketinganalysis; and decision making. Most previous research on RNN queries over trajectorydatabases assume that the data are certain. In realistic scenarios; however; trajectories areinherently uncertain due to measurement errors or time-discretized sampling. In this paper;we study RNN queries in databases of uncertain trajectories. We propose two types of RNNqueries based on a well established model for uncertain spatial temporal data based onstochastic processes; namely the Markov model.

Mario: Multi-attribute routing in open street map,Franz Graf; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Matthias Schubert,Abstract In recent years; the Open Street Map (OSM) project collected a large repository ofspatial network data containing a rich variety of information about traffic lights; road types;points of interest etc.. Formally; this network can be described as a multi-attribute graph; ie agraph considering multiple attributes when describing the traversal of an edge. In this demo;we present our framework for Multi-Attribute Routing in Open Street Map (MARiO). MARiOincludes methods for preprocessing OSM data by deriving attribute information andintegrating additional data from external sources. There are several routing algorithmsalready available and additional methods can be easily added by using a pluginmechanism.

Quality of similarity rankings in time series,Thomas Bernecker; Michael E Houle; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Matthias Renz; Erich Schubert; Arthur Zimek,Abstract Time series data objects can be interpreted as high-dimensional vectors; whichallows the application of many traditional distance measures as well as more specializedmeasures. However; many distance functions are known to suffer from poor contrast in high-dimensional settings; putting their usefulness as similarity measures into question. On theother hand; shared-nearest-neighbor distances based on the ranking of data objectsinduced by some primary distance measure have been known to lead to improvedperformance in high-dimensional settings. In this paper; we study the performance of shared-neighbor similarity measures in the context of similarity search for time series data objects.Our findings are that the use of shared-neighbor similarity measures generally results inmore stable performances than that of their associated primary distance measures.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2011,14
Reverse k-nearest neighbor monitoring on mobile objects,Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Matthias Renz; Naixin Xu; Andreas Züfle,Abstract In this paper we focus on the problem of continuously monitoring the set of Reversek-Nearest Neighbors (RkNNs) of a query object in a moving object database using a clientserver architecture. The RkNN monitoring query computes for a given query object q; the setRkNN (q) of objects having q as one of their k-nearest neighbors for each point in time. Inour setting the central server can poll the exact positions of the clients if needed. However incontrast to most existing approaches for this problem we argue that in various applications;the limiting factor is not the computational time needed but the amount of traffic sent via thenetwork. We propose an approach that minimizes the amount of communication betweenclients and central server by an intelligent approximation of the position of the clients.Additionally we propose several poll heuristics in order to further decrease the …,Proceedings of the 18th SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2010,14

The mostprominent work has focused on similarity search considering either complete time series orcertain subsequences of time series. Often; time series like temperature measurementsconsist of periodic patterns; ie patterns that repeatedly occur in defined periods over time.For example; the behavior of the temperature within one day is commonly correlated to thatof the next day. Analysis of changes within the patterns and over consecutive patterns couldbe very valuable for many application domains; in particular finance; medicine; meteorologyand ecology. In this paper; we present a framework that provides similarity search in timeseries databases regarding specific periodic patterns. In particular; an efficient threshold-based similarity search method is applied that is invariant against small distortions in time …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2009,14
Approximate clustering of time series using compact model-based descriptions,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Alexey Pryakhin; Matthias Renz; Andrew Zherdin,Abstract Clustering time series is usually limited by the fact that the length of the time serieshas a significantly negative influence on the runtime. On the other hand; approximativeclustering applied to existing compressed representations of time series (eg obtainedthrough dimensionality reduction) usually suffers from low accuracy. We propose a methodfor the compression of time series based on mathematical models that exploredependencies between different time series. In particular; each time series is represented bya combination of a set of specific reference time series. The cost of this representationdepend only on the number of reference time series rather than on the length of the timeseries. We show that using only a small number of reference time series yields a ratheraccurate representation while reducing the storage cost and runtime of clustering …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2008,14
Efficient reverse k-nearest neighbor estimation,Elke Achtert; Christian Böhm; Peer Kröger; Peter Kunath; Alexey Pryakhin; Matthias Renz,Abstract The reverse k-nearest neighbor (RkNN) problem; ie finding all objects in a data setthe k-nearest neighbors of which include a specified query object; has received increasingattention recently. Many industrial and scientific applications call for solutions of the RkNNproblem in arbitrary metric spaces where the data objects are not Euclidean and only ametric distance function is given for specifying object similarity. Usually; these applicationsneed a solution for the generalized problem where the value of k is not known in advanceand may change from query to query. In addition; many applications require a fastapproximate answer of RkNN-queries. For these scenarios; it is important to generate a fastanswer with high recall. In this paper; we propose the first approach for efficientapproximative RkNN search in arbitrary metric spaces where the value of k is specified at …,Informatik-Forschung und Entwicklung,2007,14

Knowledge-enriched route computation,Georgios Skoumas; Klaus Arthur Schmid; Gregor Jossé; Matthias Schubert; Mario A Nascimento; Andreas Züfle; Matthias Renz; Dieter Pfoser,Abstract Directions and paths; as commonly provided by navigation systems; are usuallyderived considering absolute metrics; eg; finding the shortest or the fastest path within anunderlying road network. With the aid of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI); ie; geo-spatial information contained in user generated content; we aim at obtaining paths that donot only minimize distance but also lead through more popular areas. Based on theimportance of landmarks in Geographic Information Science and in human cognition; weextract a certain kind of VGI; namely spatial relations that define closeness (nearby; next to)between pairs of points of interest (POIs); and quantify them following a probabilisticframework.

Geo-social skyline queries,Tobias Emrich; Maximilian Franzke; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle,Abstract By leveraging the capabilities of modern GPS-equipped mobile devices providingsocial-networking services; the interest in developing advanced services that combinelocation-based services with social networking services is growing drastically. Based on geo-social networks that couple personal location information with personal social contextinformation; such services are facilitated by geo-social queries that extract useful informationcombining social relationships and current locations of the users. In this paper; we tackle theproblem of geo-social skyline queries; a problem that has not been addressed so far.

Reverse k-nearest neighbor search based on aggregate point access methods,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle; Alexander Katzdobler,Abstract We propose an original solution for the general reverse k-nearest neighbor (R kNN) search problem in Euclidean spaces. Compared to the limitations of existing methodsfor the RkNN search; our approach works on top of Multi-Resolution Aggregate (MRA)versions of any index structures for multidimensional feature spaces where each non-leafnode is additionally associated with aggregate information like the sum of all leaf-entriesindexed by that node. Our solution outperforms the state-of-the-art RkNN algorithms in termsof query execution times because it exploits advanced strategies for pruning index entries.,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2009,11

PAROS: Pareto optimal route selection,Franz Graf; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Matthias Schubert,Abstract Modern maps provide a variety of information about roads and their surroundinglandscape allowing navigation systems to go beyond simple shortest path computation. Inthis demo; we show how the concept of skyline queries can be successfully adapted torouting problems considering multiple road attributes. In particular; we demonstrate how tocompute several pareto-optimal paths which contain optimal results for a variety of userpreferences. The PAROS-system has two main purposes. The first is to calculate the routeskyline for a starting point and a destination. Our demonstrator visualizes the result set for upto three road attributes. Therefore; we provide a dual view on the computed skyline paths.The first view displays the result paths on the road map itself.

As nearlyall data mining tasks on this kind of data depend on a distance function between two timeseries; a huge number of such functions has been developed during the last decades. Theintroduction of threshold-based distance functions presented a new concept of time seriessimilarity and these functions were applied to data mining techniques on a wide spectrum oftime series data. In this demonstration; we present the Java toolkit T-Time which is able toperform several data mining tasks for a complete range of threshold values in an interactiveway.

We propose aframework that extracts a sequence of local features from large multi-media time series thatreflect the characteristics of the complex structured time series more accurately than globalfeatures. In addition; we propose a set of suitable local features that can be derived by ourframework. These features are scanned from a time series amplitude-levelwise and arecalled amplitude-level features.

Continuous proximity monitoring in road networks,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Matthias Renz,Abstract In this paper; we consider the following scenario: a set of mobile objectscontinuously track their positions in a road network and are able to communicate with acentral server. The server which gets position updates from the moving objects has to detectthe event that two objects reach or exceed a specified proximity distance. This way; theserver is permanently aware of all pairs of objects that are within a certain distance range.Obviously; the communication costs between the objects and the server quickly become thebottleneck if a position update is sent to the server at each tracking time slot. We proposeupdate strategies in order to reduce the communication overhead by defining specialregions for each object. These regions are defined such that no position updates at theserver are required as long as the objects do not leave their corresponding regions.

Statistic driven acceleration of object-relational space-partitioning index structures,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peter Kunath; Martin Pfeifle; Matthias Renz,Abstract Relational index structures; as for instance the Relational Interval Tree or the LinearQuadtree; support efficient processing of queries on top of existing object-relationaldatabase systems. Furthermore; there exist effective and efficient models to estimate theselectivity and the I/O cost in order to guide the cost-based optimizer whether and how toinclude these index structures into the execution plan. By design; the models immediately fitto common extensible indexing/optimization frameworks; and their implementations exploitthe built-in statistics facilities of the database server. In this paper; we show how thesestatistics can also be used for accelerating the access methods themselves by reducing thenumber of generated join partners which results in fewer logical reads and consequentlyimproves the overall runtime.

On reverse-k-nearest-neighbor joins,Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Johannes Niedermayer; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle,Abstract A reverse k-nearest neighbour (R k NN) query determines the objects from adatabase that have the query as one of their k-nearest neighbors. Processing such a queryhas received plenty of attention in research.

Constrained reverse nearest neighbor search on mobile objects,Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle,Abstract In this paper; we formalize the novel concept of Constrained Reverse k-NearestNeighbor (CRkNN) search on mobile objects (clients) performed at a central server. TheCRkNN query computes for a given query object q the set RkNN (q) of objects having q asone of their k-nearest neighbors; iff the result set exceeds a specific threshold m; ie Card(RkNN (q))≥ m. Otherwise; the query reports an empty result. In our setting; the positions ofthe query object and database objects are approximated by minimal bounding rectanglesthat depend on the last reported location of the object; as well as on the time that has beenpassed since the object reported its recent exact location. We propose an approach thatminimizes the amount of communication between clients and central server by using theapproximation of the positions to identify true hits and true drops.

This problem has applications in social sciences; allowing to research interactionsbetween social groups and permitting social-link prediction. It can be divided into two sub-problems.

Continuous inverse ranking queries in uncertain streams,Thomas Bernecker; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Andreas Zuefle,Abstract This paper introduces a scalable approach for continuous inverse ranking onuncertain streams. An uncertain stream is a stream of object instances with confidences; egobserved positions of moving objects derived from a sensor. The confidence value assignedto each instance reflects the likelihood that the instance conforms with the current true objectstate. The inverse ranking query retrieves the rank of a given query object according to agiven score function. In this paper we present a framework that is able to update the queryresult very efficiently; as the stream provides new observations of the objects. We willtheoretically and experimentally show that the query update can be performed in linear timecomplexity. We conduct an experimental evaluation on synthetic data; which demonstratesthe efficiency of our approach.,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2011,6
Probabilistic join queries in uncertain databases,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Thomas Bernecker; Matthias Renz; Andreas Zuefle,Abstract The join query is a very important database primitive. It combines two datasets Rand S (R= S in case of a self-join) based on some query predicate into one set such that thenew set contains pairs of objects of the two original sets. In various application areas; egsensor databases; location-based services or face recognition systems; joins have to becomputed based on vague and uncertain data. As a consequence; in the recent decade a lotof approaches that address the management and efficient query processing of uncertaindata have been published. They mainly differ in the representation of the uncertain data; thedistance measures or other types of object comparisons; the types of queries; the querypredicates and the representation of the result.

In other words; hot items are objectswithin a dense region of other objects and provide a basis for many density-based datamining techniques. Intuitively; objects that share their attribute values with a lot of otherobjects could be potentially interesting as they show a typical occurrence of objects in thedatabase. Also; there are a lot of application domains; eg sensor databases; trafficmanagement or recognition systems; where objects have vague and uncertain attributes.We propose an approach for the detection of potentially interesting objects (hot items) of anuncertain database in a probabilistic way.

A solution for carrying out aglobal intersection join is to transmit all distributed information from the clients to a centralserver leading to high transfer cost. In this paper; we present a new distributed intersectionjoin for interval sequences of high-cardinality which tries to minimize these transmissioncost. Our approach is based on a suitable probability model for interval intersections whichis used on the server as well as on the various clients. On the client sites; we group intervalstogether based on this probability model. These locally created approximations are sent tothe server.

Exploiting local node cache in top-k queries within wireless sensor networks,Johannes Niedermayer; Mario A Nascimento; Matthias Renz; Peer Kröger; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract Top-k queries are a popular type of query in wireless sensor networks. Typicalsolutions rely on coordinated root-to-nodes and nodes-to-root messages and on maintainingfilters at the nodes; aiming at suppressing unnecessary messages; hence saving energyand furthering the network's lifetime. In this paper; we exploit the capability of a sensor nodeto cache a few recently observed values in order to determine" trends" for the observedvalues. Those trends can be used to further restrict the number of messages that need to beexchanged in the network; thus ultimately extending the network's lifetime. We compare ourapproach to the most recently proposed solutions in the literature using real and syntheticdatasets; and we show that our approach is able to improve the network's lifetime by up to28% without any loss in the quality of the answer.,Proceedings of the 18th SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2010,5

Continuous Quantile Query Processing in Wireless Sensor Networks.,Johannes Niedermayer; Mario A Nascimento; Matthias Renz; Peer Kröger; Hans-Peter Kriegel,ABSTRACT A major concern when processing queries within a wireless sensor network is tominimize the energy consumption of the network nodes; thus extending the networkslifetime. One way to achieve this is by minimizing the amount of communication required toanswer queries. In this paper we investigate exact continuous quantile queries; focusing onthe particular case of the median query. Many recently proposed algorithms determine aquantile by performing a series of refining histogram queries. For that class of queries; werecently proposed a cost-model to estimate the optimal number of histogram buckets withinan algorithm for minimizing the energy consumption of a query.

In this paper; we study this problem in the context of fuzzy objects thathave indeterministic boundaries. Fuzzy objects play an important role in many areas; suchas biomedical image databases and GIS. To the best of our knowledge; we present the firstefficient approach for similarity ranking in fuzzy object databases. The main challenge ofranking fuzzy objects is that these objects consist of multiple instances; each associated witha probability. We propose a framework to transform fuzzy objects into probabilistic objectswhich can then be ranked using existing algorithms for probabilistic objects.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,4
Continuous probabilistic count queries in wireless sensor networks,Anna Follmann; Mario A Nascimento; Andreas Züfle; Matthias Renz; Peer Kröger; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract Count queries in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) report the number of sensornodes whose measured values satisfy a given predicate. However; measurements in WSNsare typically imprecise due; for instance; to limited accuracy of the sensor hardware. In thiscontext; we present four algorithms for computing continuous probabilistic count queries ona WSN; ie; given a query Q we compute a probability distribution over the number of sensorssatisfying Q's predicate. These algorithms aim at maximizing the lifetime of the sensors byminimizing the communication overhead and data processing cost. Our performanceevaluation shows that by using a distributed and incremental approach we are able toreduce the number of message transfers within the WSN by up to a factor of 5 whencompared to a straightforward centralized algorithm.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2011,4
Memory-efficient A*-search using sparse embeddings,Franz Graf; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Matthias Schubert,Abstract When searching for optimal paths in a network; algorithms like A*-search need anapproximation of the minimal costs between the current node and a target node. A referencenode embedding is a universal method for making such an approximation working for anytype of positive edge weights. A drawback of the approach is that the memory consumptionof the embedding is linearly increasing with the number of attributes and landmarks. In thispaper; we propose methods for significantly decreasing the memory consumption ofembedded graphs and examine the impact of the landmark selection.,Proceedings of the 18th SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2010,4
Probabilistic frequent pattern growth for itemset mining in uncertain databases (technical report),Thomas Bernecker; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Florian Verhein; Andreas Züfle,Abstract: Frequent itemset mining in uncertain transaction databases semantically andcomputationally differs from traditional techniques applied on standard (certain) transactiondatabases. Uncertain transaction databases consist of sets of existentially uncertain items.The uncertainty of items in transactions makes traditional techniques inapplicable. In thispaper; we tackle the problem of finding probabilistic frequent itemsets based on possibleworld semantics. In this context; an itemset X is called frequent if the probability that X occursin at least minSup transactions is above a given threshold. We make the followingcontributions: We propose the first probabilistic FP-Growth algorithm (ProFP-Growth) andassociated probabilistic FP-Tree (ProFP-Tree); which we use to mine all probabilisticfrequent itemsets in uncertain transaction databases without candidate generation.

Enhanced query processing on complex spatial and temporal data,Matthias Renz,Abstract Innovative technologies in the area of multimedia and mechanical engineering aswell as novel methods for data acquisition in different scientific subareas; including geo-science; environmental science; medicine; biology and astronomy; enable a more exactrepresentation of the data; and thus; a more precise data analysis. The resulting quantitativeand qualitative growth of specifically spatial and temporal data leads to new challenges forthe management and processing of complex structured objects and requires theemployment of efficient and effective methods for data analysis. Spatial data denote thedescription of objects in space by a well-defined extension; a specific location and by theirrelationships to the other objects. Classical representatives of complex structured spatialobjects are three-dimensional CAD data from the sector" mechanical engineering" and …,*,2006,4
Tquest: threshold query execution for large sets of time series,Johannes Aßfalg; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Peter Kunath; Alexey Pryakhin; Matthias Renz,Abstract Effective and efficient data mining in time series databases is essential in manyapplication domains as for instance in financial analysis; medicine; meteorology; andenvironmental observation. In particular; temporal dependencies between time series are ofcapital importance for these applications. In this paper; we present TQuEST; a powerfulquery processor for time series databases. TQuEST supports a novel but very useful class ofqueries which we call threshold queries. Threshold queries enable searches for time serieswhose values are above a user defined threshold at certain time intervals. Example queriesare” report all ozone curves which are above their daily mean value at the same time as agiven temperature curve exceeds 28° C” or” report all blood value curves from patientswhose values exceed a certain threshold one hour after the new medication was taken” …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,4
Object-relational management of complex geographical objects,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peter Kunath; Martin Pfeifle; Matthias Renz,Abstract Modern database applications including computer-aided design; multimediainformation systems; medical imaging; molecular biology; or geographical informationsystems impose new requirements on the effective and efficient management of spatial data.Particular problems arise from the need of high resolutions for large spatial objects and fromthe design goal to use general purpose database management systems in order toguarantee industrial-strength. In the past two decades; various stand-alone spatial indexstructures have been proposed but their integration into fully-fledged database systems isproblematic. Most of these approaches are based on the decomposition of spatial objectsleading to replicating index structures.

Spatial join for high-resolution objects,H-P Kriegel; Peter Kunath; Martin Pfeifle; Matthias Renz,Modern database applications including computer-aided design (CAD); medical imaging;molecular biology; or multimedia information systems impose new requirements on efficientspatial query processing. One of the most common query types in spatial databasemanagement systems is the spatial join. In this paper; we investigate spatial join processingfor two sets of very complex spatial objects. We present an approach that is based on a fastfilter step performing the spatial join on simple primitives which conservatively approximatethe objects. Our main attention is focused on the problem how to generate approximationsadequate for high-resolution objects.

TrendTracker: Modelling the motion of trends in space and time,Klaus Arthur Schmid; Christian Frey; Fengchao Peng; Michael Weiler; Andreas Zufle; Lei Chen; Matthias Renz,Both the current trends in technology such as smart phones; general mobile devices;stationary sensors and satellites as well as a new user mentality of utilizing this technologyto voluntarily share information produce a huge flood of geo-textual data. Such data includesmicroblogging platforms such as Twitter; social networks such as Facebook; and data fromnews stations. Such geo-textual data allows to immediately detect and react to new andemerging trends. A trend is a set of keywords associated with a time interval where thefrequency of these keywords is increased significantly. In this paper; we investigate thedissemination of trends over space and time. For this purpose; we employ a four-stepframework. In the first step; we employ existing solutions to mine a large number of trends.Second; for each trend we create a spatio-temporal dissemination model; which …,Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW); 2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on,2016,3
Minimal spatio-temporal database repairs,Markus Mauder; Markus Reisinger; Tobias Emrich; Andreas Züfle; Matthias Renz; Goce Trajcevski; Roberto Tamassia,Abstract This work addresses the problem of efficient detection and fixing of inconsistenciesin spatio-temporal databases. In contrast to traditional database settings; where integrityconstraints pertain to explicitly stored values and values defined via views and aggregates;spatio-temporal data may exhibit other types of constraint violations that cannot be tied tostored or aggregated values. The main reason is that spatio-temporal phenomena arecontinuous but their database representations are discrete. Thus; the constraints aresemantic in nature; as opposed to being dependent on the actual stored data. We give ageneral definition of semantic constraints of a trajectory database and define rules to repairviolations of these constraints. In order to minimize the distortion of the state of the database;we aim at minimizing the changes needed for repairing violations of such semantic …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2015,3

Similarity search on uncertain spatio-temporal data,Johannes Niedermayer; Andreas Züfle; Tobias Emrich; Matthias Renz; Nikos Mamoulis; Lei Chen; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract In this work; we address the problem of similarity search in a database of uncertainspatio-temporal objects. Each object is defined by a set of observations ((time; location)-tuples) and a Markov chain which describes the objects uncertain motion in space and time.To model similarity-which is an important building block for many applications such asidentifying frequent motion patterns or trajectory clustering-we employ the well-knownLongest Common Subsequence (LCSS) measure; which becomes a distribution onuncertain spatio-temporal data (ULCSS). We show how the aligned version (without timeshifting) of the ULCSS can be exactly computed in PTIME; which is also verified by extensiveexperiments.,International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications,2013,3
Exploration of Monte-Carlo based probabilistic query processing in uncertain graphs,Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Johannes Niedermayer; Matthias Renz; André Suhartha; Andreas Züfle,Abstract This demo presents a framework for running probabilistic graph queries onuncertain graphs and visualizing their results. The framework supports the most commonuncertainty model for uncertain graphs; ie existential uncertainty for the edges of the graph.A large variety of meaningful graph queries are supported; such as shortest path; range; kN;reverse kN; reachability and various aggregation queries. Since the problem of exactprobability computation according to possible world semantics is in# P-Time for manycombinations of model and query; and since ignoring uncertainty (eg by using expectationsonly) will yield counterintuitive and hard to interpret results; our framework uses anoptimized version of Monte-Carlo sampling to estimate the results which allows us not onlyto perform queries that conform to possible world semantics but also to sample only parts …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,3
Similarity search in time series of dynamical model-based systems,Kyoji Kawagoe; Thomas Bernecker; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Matthias Renz; Arthur Zimek; Andreas Zufle,Similarity search in time series is usually based on an assessment of the geometric similarityof the time series curves. In bioinformatics; dynamical model-based analysis and processingis used; where the curve itself is not meaningful. However; some internal features based ona model extracted from time series are meaningful. Therefore; the similarity is based on adynamical model explaining the observation instead of being based merely on thesuperficial observation. There currently exist no methods for meaningful similarity search onsuch time series data emerging in bioinformatics. In this paper; we introduce a new similaritysearch method for time series based on similarity of internal features; called the perturbationmethod.,Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA); 2010 Workshop on,2010,3

Interval-focused similarity search in time series databases,Johannes Aßfalg; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Peter Kunath; Alexey Pryakhin; Matthias Renz,Abstract Similarity search in time series databases usually deals with comparing entire timeseries objects or subsequence search. In this paper; we formalize the notion of interval-focused similarity queries which take a set of intervals specifying relevant time frames asadditional parameter and compare the time series objects only within this user-defined timefocus. We propose an original method to efficiently support interval-focused distance rangeand k-nearest neighbor queries implementing a filter/refinement architecture. In our broadexperimental evaluation we show the superiority of our novel approach compared to existingapproaches on several real-world data sets.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,3
Time series analysis using the concept of adaptable threshold similarity,Johannes Assfalg; H-P Kriegel; Peer Kroger; Peter Kunath; Alexey Pryakhin; Matthias Renz,The issue of data mining in time series databases is of utmost importance for many practicalapplications and has attracted a lot of research in the past years. In this paper; we focus onthe recently proposed concept of threshold similarity which compares the time series basedon the time frames within which they exceed a user-defined amplitude threshold tau. Wepropose a novel approach for cluster analysis of time series based on adaptable thresholdsimilarity. The most important issue in threshold similarity is the choice of the threshold tau.Thus; the threshold tau is automatically adapted to the characteristics of a small trainingdataset using the concept of support vector machines. Thus; the optimal tau is learned froma small training set in order to yield an accurate clustering of the entire time series database.In our experimental evaluation we demonstrate that our cluster analysis using adaptable …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2006. 18th International Conference on,2006,3

Thus; data mining in time series databases is animportant instrument towards understanding the effects of drugs on individuals. However;the complex nature of time series poses a big challenge for effective and efficient datamining. In this paper; we focus on the detection of temporal dependencies between differenttime series: we introduce the novel analysis concept of threshold queries and its semi-supervised extension which supports the parameter setting by applying training datasets.Basically; threshold queries report those time series exceeding an user-defined querythreshold at certain time frames.

Efficient Join Processing for Complex Rasterized Objects.,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peter Kunath; Martin Pfeifle; Matthias Renz,Abstract: One of the most common query types in spatial database management systems isthe spatial intersection join. Many state-of-the-art join algorithms use minimal boundingrectangles to determine join candidates in a first filter step. In the case of very complexspatial objects; as used in novel database applications including computer-aided designand geographical information systems; these one-value approximations are far too coarseleading to high refinement cost. These expensive refinement cost can considerably bereduced by applying adequate compression techniques. In this paper; we introduce anefficient spatial join suitable for joining sets of complex rasterized objects.

Acceleration of relational index structures based on statistics,H-P Kriegel; Peter Kunath; Martin Pfeifle; Matthias Renz,Relational index structures; as for instance the Relational Interval Tree; the RelationalRTree; or the Linear Quadtree; support efficient processing of queries on top of existingobject-relational database systems. Furthermore; there exist effective and efficient models toestimate the selectivity and the I/O cost in order to guide the cost-based optimizer whetherand how to include these index structures into the execution plan. By design; the modelsimmediately fit to common extensible indexing/optimization frameworks; and theirimplementations exploit the built-in statistics facilities of the database server.

In its original definition; the NP-hard OrienteeringProblem (OP) asks to find a path from a source to a destination maximizing the accumulatedvalue while not exceeding a cost budget. Variations of the OP and AOP have many practicalapplications such as mobile crowdsourcing tasks (eg; repairing and maintenance ordispatching field workers); diverse logistics problems (eg; crowd control or controllingwildfires) as well as several tourist guidance problems (eg; generating trip recommendationsor navigating through theme parks). In the proposed 2TD-AOP; travel times and valuefunctions are assumed to be time-dependent. The dynamic values model; for instance …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.08484,2016,2
Uncertain voronoi cell computation based on space decomposition,Tobias Emrich; Klaus Arthur Schmid; Andreas Züfle; Matthias Renz; Reynold Cheng,Abstract The problem of computing Voronoi cells for spatial objects whose locations are notcertain has been recently studied. In this work; we propose a new approach to computeVoronoi cells for the case of objects having rectangular uncertainty regions. Since exactcomputation of Voronoi cells is hard; we propose an approximate solution. The main idea ofthis solution is to apply hierarchical access methods for both data and object space. Ourspace index is used to efficiently find spatial regions which must (not) be inside a Voronoicell. Our object index is used to efficiently identify Delauny relations; ie; data objects whichaffect the shape of a Voronoi cell.

An extendable framework for managing uncertain spatio-temporal data,Tobias Emrich; Maximilian Franzke; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Johannes Niedermayer; Matthias Renz; Andreas Züfle,Abstract This demonstration presents our Uncertain-Spatio-Temporal (UST)} framework thatwe have developed in recent years. The framework allows not only to visualize and explorespatio-temporal data consisting of (location; time; object)-triples but also provides anextensive codebase easily extensible and customizable by developers and researchers.The main research focus of this UST-framework is the explicit consideration of uncertainty;an aspect that is inherent in spatio-temporal data; due to infrequent position updates; due tophysical limitations and due to power constraints. The UST-framework can be used to obtaina deeper intuition of the quality of spatio-temporal data models. Such models aim atestimating the position of a spatio-temporal object at a time where the object's position is notexplicitly known; for example by using both historic (traffic-) pattern information; and by …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2014,2
Spatial inverse query processing,Thomas Bernecker; Tobias Emrich; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Shiming Zhang; Andreas Züfle,Abstract Traditional spatial queries return; for a given query object q; all database objectsthat satisfy a given predicate; such as epsilon range and k-nearest neighbors. This paperdefines and studies inverse spatial queries; which; given a subset of database objects Q anda query predicate; return all objects which; if used as query objects with the predicate;contain Q in their result. We first show a straightforward solution for answering inversespatial queries for any query predicate. Then; we propose a filter-and-refinement frameworkthat can be used to improve efficiency.

Given this information; it is possible to analyze andpredict the traffic density in a network which offers valuable information for traffic control;congestion prediction and prevention. In this paper; we propose a statistical approach topredict the density on any edge in such a network at a future point of time.

Knowledge extraction from crowdsourced data for the enrichment of road networks,Gregor Jossé; Klaus Arthur Schmid; Andreas Züfle; Georgios Skoumas; Matthias Schubert; Matthias Renz; Dieter Pfoser; Mario A Nascimento,Abstract In current navigation systems quantitative metrics such as distance; time andenergy are used to determine optimal paths. Yet; a “best path”; as judged by users; mighttake qualitative features into account; for instance the scenery or the touristic attractivenessof a path. Machines are unable to quantify such “soft” properties. Crowdsourced dataprovides us with a means to record user choices and opinions. In this work; we surveyheterogeneous sources of spatial; spatio-temporal and textual crowdsourced data as aproxy for qualitative information of users in movement.

Uncertain Data Classification.,Reynold Cheng; Yixiang Fang; Matthias Renz,In emerging applications such as location-based services (LBS); sensor networks; andbiological databases; the values stored in the databases are often uncertain [11; 18; 19; 30].In an LBS; for example; the location of a person or a vehicle sensed by imperfect GPShardware may not be exact. This measurement error also occurs in the temperature valuesobtained by a thermometer; where 24% of measurements are off by more than 0. 5◦ C; orabout 36% of the normal temperature range [15]. Sometimes; uncertainty may be injected tothe data by the application; in order to provide a better protection of privacy. In demographicapplications; partially aggregated data sets; rather than personal data; are available [3]. InLBS; since the exact location of a person may be sensitive; researchers have proposed to“anonymize” a location value by representing it as a region [20]. For these applications …,*,2014,1
Optimal Distance Bounds for the Mahalanobis Distance,Tobias Emrich; Gregor Jossé; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Markus Mauder; Johannes Niedermayer; Matthias Renz; Matthias Schubert; Andreas Züfle,Abstract The Mahalanobis distance; or quadratic form distance; is a distance measurecommonly used for feature-based similarity search in scenarios where features arecorrelated. For efficient query processing on such data effective distance-based spatialpruning techniques are required. In this work we investigate such pruning techniques bymeans of distance bounds of the Mahalanobis distance in the presence of rectangularspatial approximations. Specifically we discuss how to transform the problem of computingminimum and maximum distance approximations between two minimum boundingrectangles (MBRs) into a quadratic optimization problem. Furthermore; we show how therecently developed concept of spatial domination can be solved under the Mahalanobisdistance by a quadratic programming approach.,International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications,2013,1
Cost-based quantile query processing in wireless sensor networks,Johannes Niedermayer; Mario A Nascimento; Matthias Renz; Peer Kröger; Khaled Ammar; Hans-Peter Kriegel,In this paper we investigate how to efficiently and effectively use histogram queries forprocessing quantile queries in wireless sensor networks. A major concern when processingqueries within such an environment is to minimize the energy consumption by the networknodes; thus extending the networks lifetime; eg; the time when the first node runs out ofenergy. Towards that goal; we define a cost model for a refinement-based algorithm thatperforms a series of refining histogram queries in order to determine the exact quantilevalue. Given that the histogram size; ie; its number of bins; is an important factor in the queryprocessing cost; we use the defined cost model to estimate the histogram size thatminimizes the maximum energy cost per-node when processing the quantile query. This isequivalent to maximizing the time until the first node dies and therefore to extending the …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on,2013,1
Proximity queries in time-dependent traffic networks using graph embeddings,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Matthias Renz; Fabian D Winter,Abstract In many GIS applications like location-based services proximity queries in trafficnetworks usually relate to the time two individuals need to reach each other instead of their"real" geographical distance. In graphs modelling street networks; the travel time needed fora path between two nodes is seldom constant; but rather depends on the traffic conditionsand therefore on the time of day. In order to speed up common proximity queries in such agraph with time-dependent edge cost we use an intermediate filter step and propose twovariants of a Lipschitz embedding to deal with time dependency and its effects on pathfinding. While the first one is a simple modification of a static embedding; the second is fullyaware of the graphs's time component. Finally; both variants will be evaluated andcompared to each other as well as to a simpler baseline.,Proceedings of the 4th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Computational Transportation Science,2011,1

Each of these criteriahave different properties and pruning areas. This demo offers a visual interface forcomparing existing pruning criteria under various settings and in different applicationsallowing an easy integration of new criteria. Thus; the proposed software helps to evaluateand understand the strengths and weaknesses of pruning criteria for arbitrary spatialsimilarity queries.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2011,1
TiP: Analyzing periodic time series patterns,Thomas Bernecker; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Matthias Renz,Abstract Time series of sensor databases and scientific time series often consist of periodicpatterns. Examples can be found in environmental analysis; where repeated measurementsof climatic attributes like temperature; humidity or barometric pressure are taken. Dependingon season-specific meteorological influences; curves of consecutive days can be stronglyrelated to each other; whereas days of different seasons show different characteristics.Analyzing such phenomena could be very valuable for many application domains.Convenient similarity models that support similarity queries and mining based on periodicpatterns are realized in the framework TiP; which provides methods for the comparison ofsimilarity query results based on different threshold-based feature extraction methods.

Analysis of time series using compact model-based descriptions,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peer Kröger; Alexey Pryakhin; Matthias Renz,Abstract Recently; we have proposed a novel method for the compression of time seriesbased on mathematical models that explore dependencies between different time series.This representation models each time series by a combination of a set of specific referencetime series. The cost of this representation depend only on the number of reference timeseries rather than on the length of the time series. In this demonstration; we present a Javatoolkit which is able to perform several data mining tasks based on this novel time seriesrepresentation. In particular; this framework allows the user to explore the properties of ournovel approach in comparison to other state-of-the-art compression methods.

Efficient query processing on relational data-partitioning index structures,H-P Kriegel; Peter Kunath; Martin Pfeifle; Matthias Renz,In contrast to space-partitioning index structures; data-partitioning index structures naturallyadapt to the actual data distribution which results in a very good query response behavior.Besides efficient query processing; modern database applications including computer-aideddesign; medical imaging; or molecular biology require fully-fledged database managementsystems in order to guarantee industrial-strength. In this paper; we show how we canachieve efficient query processing on data-partitioning index structures within generalpurpose database systems. We reduce the navigational index traversal cost by using"extended index range scans". If a directory node is" largely" covered by the actual query; therecursive tree traversal for this node can beneficially be replaced by a scan on the leaf levelof the index instead of navigating through the directory any longer.

Efficient Information Flow Maximization in Probabilistic Graphs,Christian Frey; Andreas Zufle; Tobias Emrich; Matthias Renz,Reliable propagation of information through large networks; eg communication networks;social networks or sensor networks is very important in many applications concerningmarketing; social networks; and wireless sensor networks. However; social ties of friendshipmay be obsolete; and communication links may fail; inducing the notion of uncertainty insuch networks. In this paper; we address the problem of optimizing information propagationin uncertain networks given a constrained budget of edges. We show that this problemrequires to solve two NP-hard subproblems: the computation of expected information flow;and the optimal choice of edges. To compute the expected information flow to a sourcevertex; we propose the F-tree as a specialized data structure; that identifies independentcomponents of the graph for which the information flow can either be computed …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,*
Scenic Routes Now: Efficiently Solving the Time-Dependent Arc Orienteering Problem,Ying Lu; Gregor Jossé; Tobias Emrich; Ugur Demiryurek; Matthias Renz; Cyrus Shahabi; Matthias Schubert,Abstract Due to the availability of large transportation (eg; road network sensor data) andtransportation-related (eg; pollution; crime) data as well as the ubiquity of car navigationsystems; recent route planning techniques need to optimize for multiple criteria (eg; traveltime or distance; utility/value such as safety or attractiveness). In this paper; we introduce anovel problem called Twofold Time-Dependent Arc Orienteering Problem (2TD-AOP); whichseeks to find a path from a source to a destination maximizing an accumulated value (eg;attractiveness of the path) while not exceeding a cost budget (eg; total travel time). 2TD-AOPhas many applications in spatial crowdsourcing; real-time delivery; and online navigationsystems (eg; safest path; most scenic path).

Uncertain Voronoi cell computation based on space decomposition,Klaus Arthur Schmid; Andreas Zufle; Tobias Emrich; Matthias Renz; Reynold Cheng,Abstract To facilitate (k)-Nearest Neighbor queries; the concept of Voronoi decomposition iswidely used. In this work; we propose solutions to extend the concept of Voronoi-cells touncertain data. Due to data uncertainty; the location; the shape and the extent of a Voronoicell are random variables. To facilitate reliable query processing despite the presence ofuncertainty; we employ the concept of possible-Voronoi cells and introduce the novelconcept of guaranteed-Voronoi cells: The possible-Voronoi cell of an object U consists of allpoints in space that have a non-zero probability of having U as their nearest-neighbor; andthe guaranteed-Voronoi cell; which consists of all points in space which must have U as theirnearest-neighbor. Since exact computation of both types of Voronoi cells is computationallyhard; we propose approximate solutions. Therefore; we employ hierarchical access …,Geoinformatica,2017,*

Integrating the impact of the uncertainty isa paramount when estimating the reliability (confidence) of any query result from theunderlying input data. To deal with uncertainty; solutions have been proposedindependently in the geo-science and the data-science research community.

Directions and paths; as commonly provided by navigation systems; are usuallyderived considering absolute metrics; eg; finding the shortest or the fastest path within anunderlying road network. With the aid of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI); ie; geo-spatial information contained in user generated content; we aim at obtaining paths that donot only minimize distance but also lead through more popular areas. Based on theimportance of landmarks in Geographic Information Science and in human cognition; weextract a certain kind of VGI; namely spatial relations that define closeness (nearby; next to)between pairs of points of interest (POIs); and quantify them following a probabilisticframework. Subsequently; using Bayesian inference we obtain a crowd-based closenessconfidence score between pairs of POIs.

Uncertain Voronoi Cell Computation Based on Space Decomposition,Matthias Renz; Reynold Cheng,Abstract. The problem of computing Voronoi cells for spatial objects whose locations are notcertain has been recently studied. In this work; we propose a new approach to computeVoronoi cells for the case of objects having rectangular uncertainty regions. Since exactcomputation of Voronoi cells is hard; we propose an approximate solution. The main idea ofthis solution is to apply hierarchical access methods for both data and object space. Ourspace index is used to efficiently find spatial regions which must (not) be inside a Voronoicell. Our object index is used to efficiently identify Delauny relations; ie; data objects whichaffect the shape of a Voronoi cell. We develop three algorithms to explore index structuresand show that the approach that descends both index structures in parallel yields fast queryprocessing times. Our experiments show that we are able to approximate uncertain …,Advances in Spatial and Temporal Databases: 14th International Symposium; SSTD 2015; Hong Kong; China; August 26-28; 2015.

Similarity search in fuzzy object databases,Diana Uskat; Tobias Emrich; Andreas Züfle; Klaus Arthur Schmid; Thomas Bernecker; Matthias Renz,Abstract Fuzzy object databases are becoming more and more important in the context ofimage analysis. Examples include satellite images where blurred trees; houses or lakes canstill be organized and searched in a meaningful manner and biomedical images which canbe utilized to find similar disease patterns and monitor disease progress. One problem of theunderlying data is that it contains blurred image content; ie; fuzzy data. Therefore; an image-based similarity search; which can process huge amounts of fuzzy data in an efficient andeffective way; is desirable. The aim of this work is to develop efficient and effective methodsfor similarity search in fuzzy object databases. First; a suitable similarity measure based on ashape similarity is proposed. Based on this; two novel k-nearest neighbor algorithms forefficient similarity search are presented.

Monitoring Probabilistic Threshold SUM Query Processing in Uncertain Streams,Nina Hubig; Andreas Züfle; Tobias Emrich; Matthias Renz; Mario A Nascimento; Hans-Peter Kriegel,Abstract Many sources of data streams; eg geo-spatial streams derived from GPS-trackingsystems or sensor streams provided by sensor networks are inherently uncertain due toimpreciseness of sensing devices; due to outdated information; and due to human errors. Inorder to support data analysis on such data; aggregation queries are an important class ofqueries. This paper introduces a scalable approach for continuous probabilistic SUM queryprocessing in uncertain stream environments. Here we consider an uncertain stream as astream of uncertain values; each given by a probability distribution among the domain of thesensor values. Continuous probabilistic sum queries maintain the probability distribution ofthe sum of possible sensor values actually derived from the streaming environment.

Autonomous clustering for wireless sensor networks,Fabian D Winter; Peer Kröger; Johannes Niedermayer; Matthias Renz,Abstract Most algorithms treat Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) only as a generator of datawithout any autonomy. In contrast to this approach; we propose the ACIDE framework: Acompletely decentralized; bottom-up clustering process and information exchange that doesnot depend on given infrastructure such as fixed root nodes. While it has slightly higherrequirements for the nodes; its dynamic and independent nature has many advantages;such as the user beeing able to initiate queries from any point in the network rather thanbeing limited to query the network through an a priori fixed sink node. The framework candeal with changing environments and energy depletion. Through careful abstraction; wealso support customization and adaption to different environments.,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2013,*

Scalable Probabilistic Similarity Ranking in Uncertain Databases (Technical Report),Thomas Bernecker; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Nikos Mamoulis; Matthias Renz; Andreas Zuefle,Abstract: This paper introduces a scalable approach for probabilistic top-k similarity rankingon uncertain vector data. Each uncertain object is represented by a set of vector instancesthat are assumed to be mutually-exclusive. The objective is to rank the uncertain dataaccording to their distance to a reference object. We propose a framework that incrementallycomputes for each object instance and ranking position; the probability of the object falling atthat ranking position. The resulting rank probability distribution can serve as input for severalstate-of-the-art probabilistic ranking models. Existing approaches compute this probabilitydistribution by applying a dynamic programming approach of quadratic complexity. In thispaper we theoretically as well as experimentally show that our framework reduces this to alinear-time complexity while having the same memory requirements; facilitated by …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0907.2868,2009,*

This leadsto two orthogonal cases: The data may be erroneous; ie they must be corrected. Or; themodel may outdated and must be adjusted to the data.

Efficient Query Processing on the Relational Quadtree.,Hans-Peter Kriegel; Peter Kunath; Martin Pfeifle; Matthias Renz,Abstract. Relational index structures; as for instance the Relational Interval Tree; theRelational R-Tree; or the Linear Quadtree; support efficient processing of queries on top ofexisting object-relational database systems. Furthermore; there exist effective and efficientmodels to estimate the selectivity and the I/O cost in order to guide the cost-based optimizerwhether and how to include these index structures into the execution plan. By design; themodels immediately fit to common extensible indexing/optimization frameworks; and theirimplementations exploit the built-in statistics facilities of the database server. In this paper;we show how these statistics can also be used for accelerating geo-spatial queries using therelational quadtree by reducing the number of generated join partners which results in lesslogical reads and consequently improves the overall runtime.
