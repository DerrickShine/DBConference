In vivo bone strain and finite‐element modeling of the craniofacial haft in catarrhine primates,Callum F Ross; Michael A Berthaume; Paul C Dechow; Jose Iriarte‐Diaz; Laura B Porro; Brian G Richmond; Mark Spencer; David Strait,Abstract Hypotheses regarding patterns of stress; strain and deformation in the craniofacialskeleton are central to adaptive explanations for the evolution of primate craniofacial form.The complexity of craniofacial skeletal morphology makes it difficult to evaluate thesehypotheses with in vivo bone strain data. In this paper; new in vivo bone strain data from theintraorbital surfaces of the supraorbital torus; postorbital bar and postorbital septum; theanterior surface of the postorbital bar; and the anterior root of the zygoma are combined withpublished data from the supraorbital region and zygomatic arch to evaluate the validity of afinite-element model (FEM) of a macaque cranium during mastication. The behavior of thismodel is then used to test hypotheses regarding the overall deformation regime in thecraniofacial haft of macaques. This FEM constitutes a hypothesis regarding deformation …,Journal of Anatomy,2011,69
Viewpoints: diet and dietary adaptations in early hominins: the hard food perspective,David S Strait; Paul Constantino; Peter W Lucas; Brian G Richmond; Mark A Spencer; Paul C Dechow; Callum F Ross; Ian R Grosse; Barth W Wright; Bernard A Wood; Gerhard W Weber; Qian Wang; Craig Byron; Dennis E Slice; Janine Chalk; Amanda L Smith; Leslie C Smith; Sarah Wood; Michael Berthaume; Stefano Benazzi; Christine Dzialo; Kelli Tamvada; Justin A Ledogar,ABSTRACT Recent biomechanical analyses examining the feeding adaptations of earlyhominins have yielded results consistent with the hypothesis that hard foods exerted aselection pressure that influenced the evolution of australopith morphology. However; thishypothesis appears inconsistent with recent reconstructions of early hominin diet based ondental microwear and stable isotopes. Thus; it is likely that either the diets of someaustralopiths included a high proportion of foods these taxa were poorly adapted toconsume (ie; foods that they would not have processed efficiently); or that aspects of whatwe thought we knew about the functional morphology of teeth must be wrong. Evaluation ofthese possibilities requires a recognition that analyses based on microwear; isotopes; finiteelement modeling; and enamel chips and cracks each test different types of hypotheses …,American Journal of Physical Anthropology,2013,50
The effect of early hominin occlusal morphology on the fracturing of hard food items,Michael Berthaume; Ian R Grosse; Nirdesh D Patel; David S Strait; Sarah Wood; Brian G Richmond,Abstract Tooth profile plays an important role in interpretations of the functional morphologyof extinct species. We tested hypotheses that australopith occlusal morphology influencesthe fracture force required to crack large; hard food items using a combination of physicaltesting and finite element analysis (FEA). We performed mechanical experiments simulatingboth molar and premolar biting using metal replicas of four hominin specimens representingspecies that differ in occlusal relief (Praeanthropus afarensis; Australopithecus africanus;Paranthropus robustus; and P. boisei). The replicas were inserted into an Instron machineand used to fracture hollow acrylic hemispheres with known material properties. Thesehemispheres simulate a hard and brittle food item but exhibit far less variability in size andstrength than actual nuts or seeds; thereby facilitating interpretations of tooth function …,The Anatomical Record,2010,48
The feeding biomechanics and dietary ecology of Paranthropus boisei,Amanda L Smith; Stefano Benazzi; Justin A Ledogar; Kelli Tamvada; Leslie C Pryor Smith; Gerhard W Weber; Mark A Spencer; Peter W Lucas; Shaji Michael; Ali Shekeban; Khaled Al‐Fadhalah; Abdulwahab S Almusallam; Paul C Dechow; IAN Grosse; Callum F Ross; Richard H Madden; Brian G Richmond; Barth W Wright; Qian Wang; Craig Byron; Dennis E Slice; Sarah Wood; Christine Dzialo; Michael A Berthaume; Adam Casteren; David S Strait,ABSTRACT The African Plio-Pleistocene hominins known as australopiths evolved derivedcraniodental features frequently interpreted as adaptations for feeding on either hard; orcompliant/tough foods. Among australopiths; Paranthropus boisei is the most robust form;exhibiting traits traditionally hypothesized to produce high bite forces efficiently andstrengthen the face against feeding stresses. However; recent mechanical analyses implythat P. boisei may not have been an efficient producer of bite force and that robustmorphology in primates is not necessarily strong. Here we use an engineering method; finiteelement analysis; to show that the facial skeleton of P. boisei is structurally strong; exhibits astrain pattern different from that in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and Australopithecusafricanus; and efficiently produces high bite force. It has been suggested that P. boisei …,The Anatomical Record,2015,40
Probabilistic finite element analysis of a craniofacial finite element model,Michael A Berthaume; Paul C Dechow; Jose Iriarte-Diaz; Callum F Ross; David S Strait; Qian Wang; Ian R Grosse,Abstract We employed a probabilistic finite element analysis (FEA) method to determine howvariability in material property values affects stress and strain values in a finite model of aMacaca fascicularis cranium. The material behavior of cortical bone varied in three ways:isotropic homogeneous; isotropic non-homogeneous; and orthotropic non-homogeneous.The material behavior of the trabecular bone and teeth was always treated as isotropic andhomogeneous. All material property values for the cranium were randomized with aGaussian distribution with either coefficients of variation (CVs) of 0.2 or with CVs calculatedfrom empirical data. Latin hypercube sampling was used to determine the values of thematerial properties used in the finite element models. In total; four hundred and twenty sixseparate deterministic FE simulations were executed. We tested four hypotheses in this …,Journal of Theoretical Biology,2012,22
Food mechanical properties and dietary ecology,Michael A Berthaume,Abstract Interdisciplinary research has benefitted the fields of anthropology and engineeringfor decades: a classic example being the application of material science to the field offeeding biomechanics. However; after decades of research; discordances have developedin how mechanical properties are defined; measured; calculated; and used due todisharmonies between and within fields. This is highlighted by “toughness;” or energyrelease rate; the comparison of incomparable tests (ie; the scissors and wedge tests); andthe comparison of incomparable metrics (ie; the stress and displacement-limited indices).Furthermore; while material scientists report on a myriad of mechanical properties; it iscommon for feeding biomechanics studies to report on just one (energy release rate) or two(energy release rate and Young's modulus); which may or may not be the most …,*,2016,20
How does tooth cusp radius of curvature affect brittle food item processing?,Michael A Berthaume; Elizabeth R Dumont; Laurie R Godfrey; Ian R Grosse,Tooth cusp sharpness; measured by radius of curvature (RoC); has been predicted to play asignificant role in brittle/hard food item fracture. Here; we set out to test three existinghypotheses about this relationship: namely; the Blunt and Strong Cusp hypotheses; whichpredict that dull cusps will be most efficient at brittle food item fracture; and the Pointed Cusphypothesis; which predicts that sharp cusps will be most efficient at brittle food item fractureusing a four cusp bunodont molar. We also put forth and test the newly constructed ComplexCusp hypothesis; which predicts that a mixture of dull and sharp cusps will be most efficientat brittle food item fracture. We tested the four hypotheses using finite-element models of fourcusped; bunodont molars. When testing the three existing hypotheses; we assumed allcusps had the same level of sharpness (RoC); and gained partial support for the Blunt …,Journal of the Royal Society Interface,2013,19
Mechanical evidence that Australopithecus sediba was limited in its ability to eat hard foods,Justin A Ledogar; Amanda L Smith; Stefano Benazzi; Gerhard W Weber; Mark A Spencer; Keely B Carlson; Kieran P McNulty; Paul C Dechow; Ian R Grosse; Callum F Ross; Brian G Richmond; Barth W Wright; Qian Wang; Craig Byron; Kristian J Carlson; Darryl J De Ruiter; Lee R Berger; Kelli Tamvada; Leslie C Pryor; Michael A Berthaume; David S Strait,Abstract Australopithecus sediba has been hypothesized to be a close relative of the genusHomo. Here we show that MH1; the type specimen of A. sediba; was not optimized toproduce high molar bite force and appears to have been limited in its ability to consumefoods that were mechanically challenging to eat. Dental microwear data have previouslybeen interpreted as indicating that A. sediba consumed hard foods; so our findings illustratethat mechanical data are essential if one aims to reconstruct a relatively complete picture offeeding adaptations in extinct hominins. An implication of our study is that the key tounderstanding the origin of Homo lies in understanding how environmental changesdisrupted gracile australopith niches. Resulting selection pressures led to changes in dietand dietary adaption that set the stage for the emergence of our genus.,Nature communications,2016,17
Functional implications of squamosal suture size in Paranthropus boisei,Christine Dzialo; Sarah A Wood; Michael Berthaume; Amanda Smith; Elizabeth R Dumont; Stefano Benazzi; Gerhard W Weber; David S Strait; Ian R Grosse,ABSTRACT It has been hypothesized that the extensively overlapping temporal and parietalbones of the squamosal sutures in Paranthropus boisei are adaptations for withstandingloads associated with feeding. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to investigate thebiomechanical effects of suture size (ie; the area of overlap between the temporal andparietal bones) on stress; strain energy; and strain ratio in the squamosal sutures of Pantroglodytes and P. boisei (specimen OH 5) during biting. Finite element models (FEMs) ofOH 5 and a P. troglodytes cranium were constructed from CT scans. These models containsutures that approximate the actual suture sizes preserved in both crania. The FEM of Panwas then modified to create two additional FEMs with squamosal sutures that are 50%smaller and 25% larger than those in the original model.

Tooth cusp sharpness as a dietary correlate in great apes,Michael A Berthaume,ABSTRACT Mammalian molars have undergone heavy scrutiny to determine correlatesbetween morphology and diet. Here; the relationship between one aspect of occlusalmorphology; tooth cusp radius of curvature (RoC); and two broad dietary categories; folivoryand frugivory; is analyzed in apes. The author hypothesizes that there is a relationshipbetween tooth cusp RoC and diet; and that folivores have sharper teeth than frugivores; andfurther test the correlation between tooth cusp RoC and tooth cusp size. Eight measures oftooth cusp RoC (two RoCs per cusp) were taken from 53 M 2 s from four species andsubspecies of frugivorous apes (Pongo pygmaeus; Pan troglodytes troglodytes; Pantroglodytes schweinfurthii; and Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and two subspecies of folivorous apes(Gorilla beringei beringei; and Gorilla beringei graueri).

What did Hadropithecus eat; and why should paleoanthropologists care?,Laurie R Godfrey; Brooke E Crowley; Kathleen M Muldoon; Elizabeth A Kelley; Stephen J King; Andrew W Best; Michael A Berthaume,Abstract Over 40 years ago; Clifford Jolly noted different ways in which Hadropithecusstenognathus converged in its craniodental anatomy with basal hominins and with geladas.The Malagasy subfossil lemur Hadropithecus departs from its sister taxon; Archaeolemur; inthat it displays comparatively large molars; reduced incisors and canines; a shortenedrostrum; and thickened mandibular corpus. Its molars; however; look nothing like those ofbasal hominins; rather; they much more closely resemble molars of grazers such asTheropithecus. A number of tools have been used to interpret these traits; including dentalmicrowear and texture analysis; molar internal and external morphology; and finite elementanalysis of crania. These tools; however; have failed to provide support for a simple dietaryinterpretation; whereas there is some consistency in the inferences they support; dietary …,American journal of primatology,2016,7

The effects of relative food item size on optimal tooth cusp sharpness during brittle food item processing,Michael A Berthaume; Elizabeth R Dumont; Laurie R Godfrey; Ian R Grosse,Teeth are often assumed to be optimal for their function; which allows researchers to derivedietary signatures from tooth shape. Most tooth shape analyses normalize for tooth size;potentially masking the relationship between relative food item size and tooth shape. Here;we model how relative food item size may affect optimal tooth cusp radius of curvature (RoC)during the fracture of brittle food items using a parametric finite-element (FE) model of a four-cusped molar. Morphospaces were created for four different food item sizes by altering cuspRoCs to determine whether optimal tooth shape changed as food item size changed. Themorphospaces were also used to investigate whether variation in efficiency metrics (iestresses; energy and optimality) changed as food item size changed. We found that optimaltooth shape changed as food item size changed; but that all optimal morphologies were …,Journal of the Royal Society Interface,2014,6
On the relationship between tooth shape and masticatory efficiency: A finite element study,Michael A Berthaume,ABSTRACT Dental topography has successfully linked disparate tooth shapes to distinctdietary categories; but not to masticatory efficiency. Here; the relationship between fourdental topographic metrics and brittle food item breakdown efficiency during compressivebiting was investigated using a parametric finite element model of a bunodont molar. Fooditem breakdown efficiency was chosen to represent masticatory efficiency as it isolated tooth–food item interactions; where most other categories of masticatory efficiency include severalaspects of the masticatory process. As relative food item size may affect thepresence/absence of any relationship; four isometrically scaled; hemispherical; proxy fooditems were considered. Topographic metrics were uncorrelated to food item breakdownefficiency irrespective of relative food item size; and dental topographic metrics were …,The Anatomical Record,2016,3
Tooth cusp radius of curvature as a dietary correlate in primates,Michael A Berthaume,Abstract Tooth cusp radius of curvature (RoC) has been hypothesized to play an importantrole in food item breakdown; but has remained largely unstudied due to difficulties inmeasuring and modeling RoC in multicusped teeth. We tested these hypotheses using aparametric model of a four cusped; maxillary; bunodont molar in conjunction with finiteelement analysis. When our data failed to support existing hypotheses; we put forth andtested the Complex Cusp Hypothesis which states that; during brittle food items breakdown;an optimally shaped molar would be maximizing stresses in the food item while minimizingstresses in the enamel. After gaining support for this hypothesis; we tested the effects ofrelative food item size on optimal molar morphology and found that the optimal set of RoCschanged as relative food item size changed. However; all optimal morphologies were …,*,2013,3
Skeletal immaturity; rostral sparing; and disparate hip morphologies as biomechanical causes for Legg‐Calvé‐Perthes' disease,Michael A Berthaume; Daniel C Perry; Catherine A Dobson; Ulrich Witzel; Nicholas M Clarke; Michael J Fagan,Abstract Legg-Calvé-Perthes'(Perthes') disease is a developmental disease of the hip jointthat may result in numerous short and long term problems. The etiology of the diseaseremains largely unknown; but the mechanism is believed to be vascular and/orbiomechanical in nature. There are several anatomical characteristics that tend to beprevalent in children with Perthes' disease; namely: skeletal immaturity; reduced height; androstral sparing. We present an overview of the literature; summarizing the currentunderstanding of the pathogenesis; particularly related to how the formation of thevasculature to the femoral epiphysis places children aged 5–8 at a higher risk for Perthes'disease; how skeletal immaturity and rostral sparing could increase the probability ofdeveloping Perthes' disease; and how animal models have aided our understanding of …,Clinical Anatomy,2016,2

Extant ape dental topography and its implications for reconstructing the emergence of early Homo,Michael A Berthaume; Kes Schroer,Abstract Dental topography reflects diet accurately in several extant and extinct mammalianclades. However; dental topographic dietary reconstructions have high success rates onlywhen closely related taxa are compared. Given the dietary breadth that exists among extantapes and likely existed among fossil hominins; dental topographic values from manyspecies and subspecies of great apes are necessary for making dietary inferences about thehominin fossil record. Here; we present the results of one metric of dental topography;Dirichlet normal energy (DNE); for seven groups of great apes (Pongo pygmaeuspygmaeus; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes troglodytes and schweinfurthii; Gorilla gorillagorilla; Gorilla beringei graueri and beringei).

Were Neandertal Humeri Adapted for Spear Thrusting or Throwing?

The anteroposteriorly expanded cross-section of Neandertal humerihave led some to argue they thrusted their weapons; while the rounder cross-section of LateUpper Paleolithic modern human humeri suggests they threw their weapons.

Finite element modeling suggests functional divergence in the skulls of palaeognathous and neognathous birds,SWS Gussekloo; IR Grosse; M Berthaume; ER Dumont,The basal bifurcation in the phylogeny of modern birds is between ostrich-like birds (ratitesand tinamous; Palaeognathae) and all other birds (Neognathae). Most differences betweenthe Palaeognathae and Neognathae lie in the reduction or loss of the ability to fly; but thecrania of palaeognaths are also more robust and more fenestrated than those ofneognathous birds. The specific morphology of the palaeognath cranium has beenattributed to neoteny; but recent studies suggest that it must have functional significance.Within the avialan lineage the cranium becomes increasingly fenestrated leading to areduced number of lateral elements. This trend is more pronounced in palaeognaths than inneognaths.
