SCF-mediated mast cell infiltration and activation exacerbate the inflammation and immunosuppression in tumor microenvironment,Bo Huang; Zhang Lei; Gui-Mei Zhang; Dong Li; Chuanwang Song; Bo Li; Yanyan Liu; Ye Yuan; Jay Unkeless; Huabao Xiong; Zuo-Hua Feng,Despite the evidence for the role of inflammation in cancer initiation; promotion; andprogression; the precise mechanism by which the inflammation within tumor is orchestratedby inflammatory cells remains to be determined. Here; we report that tumor-infiltrating mastcells remodel tumor microenvironment and promote tumor growth. Mast cell infiltration andactivation in tumors were mainly mediated by tumor-derived stem cell factor (SCF) and itsreceptor c-Kit on mast cells. Low concentrations of SCF efficiently induced the chemotacticmigration of mast cells. Tumor-infiltrating mast cells; activated by higher concentrations ofSCF; expressed multiple proinflammatory factors and increased IL-17 expression in tumors.The activity of NF-κB and AP-1 in tumor cells was intensified in the mast cell–remodeledinflammatory microenvironment. SCF-activated mast cells also exacerbated tumor …,Blood,2008,236
CCL2/CCR2 pathway mediates recruitment of myeloid suppressor cells to cancers,Bo Huang; Zhang Lei; Jie Zhao; Wei Gong; Jinwen Liu; Zhenyong Chen; Yi Liu; Dong Li; Ye Yuan; Gui-Mei Zhang; Zuo-Hua Feng,Abstract In addition to direct effect on tumor cells; the tumor-promoting activity of CCL2 hasbeen ascribed to its role in chemoattracting tumor-associated macrophages. However it isunclear whether CCL2 also attracts other immune regulatory cells during tumordevelopment. In this study; we confirmed the ubiquitous expression of CCR2 in myeloidsuppressor cells (MSCs); a main inducer for tumor immune evasion; and identified thatcancer patient-derived CCL2 mediated the migration of MSCs to tumors in vitro; which couldbe interdicted by antibodies neutralizing CCL2 or blocking CCR2. In mouse tumor model;the adoptively transferred CCR2−/− MSCs could not migrate to either tumor or spleen asefficiently as WT MSCs. The absence of CCL2/CCR2 signaling hindered both MSCmigration and MSC-promoted tumor growth. Our data provide evidence that CCL2/CCR2 …,Cancer letters,2007,213
Listeria monocytogenes promotes tumor growth via tumor cell toll-like receptor 2 signaling,Bo Huang; Jie Zhao; Shiqian Shen; Hongxing Li; Kai-Li He; Guan-Xin Shen; Lloyd Mayer; Jay Unkeless; Dong Li; Ye Yuan; Gui-Mei Zhang; Huabao Xiong; Zuo-Hua Feng,The contribution of bacterial infection to tumorigenesis is usually ascribed to infection-associated inflammation. An alternate view is that direct interaction of bacteria with tumorcells promotes tumor progression. Here; we show that the microenvironment of large tumorsfavors bacterial survival; which in turn directly accelerates tumor growth by activating tumorcell Toll-like receptors (TLR). Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) survives in the microenvironmentof large but not small tumors; resulting in the promotion of tumor growth. Lm did not affect thepercentage of regulatory T cells or myeloid suppressor cells in the tumor. Through TLR2signaling; Lm activated mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor-κB in tumorcells; resulting in the increased production of nitric oxide and interleukin-6 and increasedproliferation of tumor cells. All of these effects were abrogated by silencing expression of …,Cancer Research,2007,201

In this study; thebiochemical compositions of urine; serum; and extracts of liver and kidney tissues of ratstreated with nano-copper at the different doses (50; 100; and 200 mg/kg/d for 5 d) wereinvestigated using 1 H NMR techniques with the pattern recognition methods. Serumbiochemical analysis and histopathological examinations of the liver and kidney of all therats were simultaneously performed. All the results indicated that the effects produced bynano-copper at a dose of 100 or 50 mg/kg/d were less than those induced at a higher doseof 200 mg/kg/d. Nano-copper induced overt hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity at 200 mg/kg/dfor 5 d; which mainly involved scattered dot hepatocytic necrosis and widespread renal …,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2008,177

Pharmacokinetics screening for multi-components absorbed in the rat plasma after oral administration traditional Chinese medicine formula Yin-Chen-Hao-Tang by...,Xijun Wang; Hui Sun; Aihua Zhang; Guozheng Jiao; Wenjun Sun; Ye Yuan,Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been widely used in many oriental countries forthousands of years and played an indispensable role in the prevention and treatment ofdiseases; especially the complicated and chronic ones. It is a very complex mixturecontaining hundreds or thousands of different components. Pharmacokinetic study on activeconstituents in TCM preparations is a good way for us to explain and predict a variety ofevents related to the efficacy and toxicity of TCM. A selective and sensitive method of ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS) was first developed to screen thepotentially bioactive components in vivo; using the semi-quantitative determination ofmulticomponents in the rat plasma after a single oral administration of Yin-Chen-Hao …,Analyst,2011,124

Blocking programmed death-1 ligand-PD-1 interactions by local gene therapy results in enhancement of antitumor effect of secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine,Yu-Fei He; Gui-Mei Zhang; Xiao-Hong Wang; Hui Zhang; Ye Yuan; Dong Li; Zuo-Hua Feng,The negative signal provided by interactions of programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligands;costimulatory molecules PD-L1 (also B7-H1) and PD-L2 (also B7-DC); is involved in themechanisms of tumor immune evasion. In this study; we found that this negative signal wasalso involved in immune evasion in tumor immunotherapy. When we used different doses ofa constructed eukaryotic expression plasmid; pSLC; which expresses functional murinesecondary lymphoid tissue chemokine (SLC; CCL21); to treat BALB/c mice inoculated withH22 murine hepatoma cells; the inhibitory effect was enhanced along with the increase ofpSLC dosage. Unexpectedly; however; the best complete inhibition rate of tumor wasreached when pSLC was used at the dosage of 50 μg but not 100 or 200 μg.

Disruption of the SRC-1 gene in mice suppresses breast cancer metastasis without affecting primary tumor formation,Shu Wang; Yuhui Yuan; Lan Liao; Shao-Qing Kuang; Jean Ching-Yi Tien; Bert W O'Malley; Jianming Xu,Abstract Steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) is a coactivator for nuclear hormonereceptors such as estrogen and progesterone receptors and certain other transcriptionfactors such as Ets-2 and PEA3. SRC-1 expression in breast cancer is associated withHER2 and c-Myc expression and with reduced disease-free survival. In this study; SRC-1−/−mice were backcrossed with FVB mice and then cross-bred with MMTV-polyoma middle Tantigen (PyMT) mice to investigate the role of SRC-1 in breast cancer. Although mammarytumor initiation and growth were similar in SRC-1−/−/PyMT and wild-type (WT)/PyMT mice;genetic ablation of SRC-1 antagonized PyMT-induced restriction of mammary ductaldifferentiation and elongation. SRC-1−/−/PyMT mammary tumors were also moredifferentiated than WT/PyMT mammary tumors. The intravasation of mammary tumor cells …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2009,108
Soluble form of T cell Ig mucin 3 is an inhibitory molecule in T cell-mediated immune response,Hui Geng; Gui-Mei Zhang; Dong Li; Hui Zhang; Ye Yuan; Han-Gang Zhu; Han Xiao; Ling-Fei Han; Zuo-Hua Feng,T cell Ig mucin 3 (Tim-3) has been found to play an important role in Th1-mediated auto-andalloimmune responses; but the function of soluble form of Tim-3 (sTim-3) remains to beelucidated. In this study; we report the inhibitory effect of sTim-3 on T cell-mediated immuneresponse. In this study; sTim-3 mRNA was found; among different tissues and organs; onlyin splenic cells; and the activation of splenocytes resulted in up-regulated production of bothsTim-3 mRNA and protein. We constructed a eukaryotic expression plasmid; psTim-3; whichexpresses functional murine sTim-3. In C57BL/6 mice inoculated with B16F1 melanomacells; the growth of tumor was facilitated by the expression of this plasmid in vivo.Furthermore; sTim-3 inhibited the responses of T cells to Ag-specific stimulation or anti-CD3mAb plus anti-CD28 mAb costimulation and the production of cytokines IL-2 and IFN-γ in …,The Journal of Immunology,2006,92

Steroid receptor coactivator-3 is required for inhibition of neointima formation by estrogen,Yuhui Yuan; Lan Liao; David A Tulis; Jianming Xu,Background—The vasoprotective effects of estrogen are mediated by estrogen receptors(ERs). ERs are transcription factors that require coactivators to exert transcriptional activity.The steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3; also known as pCIP; AIB1; ACTR; and TRAM-1)interacts with estrogen-bound ERs and strongly coactivates the transcription of target genesin cultured cells. This study has characterized the expression of SRC-3 in cardiovasculartissue and the role of SRC-3 in estrogen-dependent vasoprotection from vascular injury.Methods and Results—Phenotypically normal SRC-3+/− mice with a knock-in LacZ reporterwere used to characterize SRC-3 expression by X-gal staining within the cardiovascularsystem. Staining signals were specifically detected in vascular smooth muscle cells andendothelial cells but not in myocardial cells. The role of SRC-3 during vascular …,Circulation,2002,83
Deletion of the cancer-amplified coactivator AIB3 results in defective placentation and embryonic lethality,Shao-Qing Kuang; Lan Liao; Hao Zhang; Fred A Pereira; Yuhui Yuan; Francesco J DeMayo; Lan Ko; Jianming Xu,Abstract The amplified in breast cancer-3 (AIB3; ASC-2; RAP250; PRIP; TRBP; NRC; orNcoA6) gene is characterized as a cancer-amplified transcriptional coactivator for nuclearreceptors; which include the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). Toassess its biological function; we deleted theAIB3 gene in mice by homologousrecombination. AIB3+/− mice are developmentally normal and fertile. AIB3−/− embryosexhibit growth restriction and lethality during 9.75–11.5 days postconception. The embryoniclethality is probably attributed to defects in the development of the placental vascularnetwork and cardiac hypoplasia. These defects include the failure of labyrinthinedevelopment; the dilation of maternal blood sinuses; the massive erythrophagocytosis bytrophoblasts; the alteration of trophoblast populations; and the lower proliferation of …,Journal of Biological Chemistry,2002,78

HSP70 vaccine in combination with gene therapy with plasmid DNA encoding sPD‐1 overcomes immune resistance and suppresses the progression of pulmonary...,Hui Geng; Gui‐Mei Zhang; Han Xiao; Ye Yuan; Dong Li; Hui Zhang; Hui Qiu; Yu‐Fei He; Zuo‐Hua Feng,Abstract Many tumor immunotherapy efforts are focused on the generation of strong T-cellresponse against tumor antigens. However; strong T-cell response does not always coincidewith tumor rejection; for which upregulated expression of immunoinhibitory molecules maybe responsible. In this study; the treatment with heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) vaccineinduced an infiltration of T cells into the tumor site as well as the expression of IFN-γ and IL-2; and delayed lung metastases of tumor; but the tumor progression nonetheless occurfinally. We demonstrated that B7-H1 expressed by residual tumor cells was responsible forthe resistance of tumor to the therapy with HSP70 vaccine. Blockade of B7-H1 by iv injectionpPD-1A; a plasmid encoding the extracellular domain of PD-1 (sPD-1); could reverse thisresistance and enhance the therapeutic efficacy. To complement these findings; we …,International journal of cancer,2006,72
Angiogenin-cleaved tRNA halves interact with cytochrome c; protecting cells from apoptosis during osmotic stress,Mridusmita Saikia; Raul Jobava; Marc Parisien; Andrea Putnam; Dawid Krokowski; Xing-Huang Gao; Bo-Jhih Guan; Yiyuan Yuan; Eckhard Jankowsky; Zhaoyang Feng; Guo-fu Hu; Marianne Pusztai-Carey; Madhavi Gorla; Naresh Babu V Sepuri; Tao Pan; Maria Hatzoglou,ABSTRACT Adaptation to changes in extracellular tonicity is essential for cell survival.However; severe or chronic hyperosmotic stress induces apoptosis; which involvescytochrome c (Cyt c) release from mitochondria and subsequent apoptosome formation.Here; we show that angiogenin-induced accumulation of tRNA halves (or tiRNAs) isaccompanied by increased survival in hyperosmotically stressed mouse embryonicfibroblasts. Treatment of cells with angiogenin inhibits stress-induced formation of theapoptosome and increases the interaction of small RNAs with released Cyt c in aribonucleoprotein (Cyt c-RNP) complex. Next-generation sequencing of RNA isolated fromthe Cyt c-RNP complex reveals that 20 tiRNAs are highly enriched in the Cyt c-RNPcomplex. Preferred components of this complex are 5′ and 3′ tiRNAs of specific …,Molecular and cellular biology,2014,71
Triggering of Toll-like receptor 4 on metastatic breast cancer cells promotes αvβ3-mediated adhesion and invasive migration,Sheng-Jun Liao; Yuan-Hong Zhou; Ye Yuan; Dong Li; Feng-Hua Wu; Qi Wang; Jian-Hua Zhu; Bin Yan; Jing-Jing Wei; Gui-Mei Zhang; Zuo-Hua Feng,Abstract Triggering of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on tumor cells has been found to promotetumor progression by promoting tumor cell proliferation and survival. So far; however; theeffect of TLR4 signaling on tumor metastasis has not been well elucidated. Here; we reportthat triggering of TLR4 on metastatic breast cancer cells could reciprocally regulate theexpression of αvβ3 and the expressions of TPM1 and maspin; and promote αvβ3-mediatedadhesion and invasive migration of the cells. In metastatic breast cancer cells; TLR4signaling increased the expression of integrin αvβ3 by activating NF-κB; resulting in theincreased adhesion capacity of tumor cells to the ligand for αvβ3; and the increasedpolymerization of actin and production of MMP-9 in tumor cells in response to ECM. HoxD3was required for the up-regulation of αv and β3 expressions by NF-κB. Moreover; TLR4 …,Breast cancer research and treatment,2012,65
IL-6 cooperates with G-CSF to induce protumor function of neutrophils in bone marrow by enhancing STAT3 activation,Bin Yan; Jing-Jing Wei; Ye Yuan; Rui Sun; Dong Li; Jing Luo; Sheng-Jun Liao; Yuan-Hong Zhou; Yu Shu; Qi Wang; Gui-Mei Zhang; Zuo-Hua Feng,Neutrophils are known to have antitumor potential. However; in recent years the tumor-promoting effect of neutrophils has been well demonstrated. So far; it remains unclear whatcauses the conversion of neutrophil function from tumor suppressive to tumor promoting. Inthis article; we report that the conversion of murine neutrophil function occurs in bonemarrow; and that IL-6 cooperation with G-CSF is required for this conversion. IL-6cooperated with G-CSF to modulate neutrophils in bone marrow; altering the activationpotential of signaling pathways in neutrophils; especially that of STAT3. Costimulation with G-CSF and IL-6 induced a higher level of phospho-STAT3 in neutrophils; which was furtherincreased by upregulation of STAT3 expression in neutrophils owing to downregulation ofIFN-β expression in bone marrow macrophages by IL-6.

Observations of sediment resuspension and settling off the mouth of Jiaozhou Bay; Yellow Sea,Ye Yuan; Hao Wei; Liang Zhao; Wensheng Jiang,Abstract We deployed bottom-mounted quadrapod equipped with acoustic Doppler currentprofiler (ADCP); acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV); and optical backscatter sensor (OBS)over two semidiurnal tidal cycles along the western coast of the Yellow Sea; China. Incombination with shipboard profiling of CTD and LISST-100; we resolved the temporal andspatial distributions of tidal currents; turbulent kinetic energy (TKE); suspended sedimentconcentration (SSC) and particle size distributions. During the observations; tidal-inducedbottom shear stress was the main stirring factor. However; weak tidal flow during the ebbphase was accompanied by two large SSC and median size events. The interactions ofseiche-induced oscillations with weak ebb flow induced multiple flow reversals and provideda source of turbulence production; which stripped up the benthic fluff layers (only several …,Continental Shelf Research,2008,49

Dysregulated LRRK2 signaling in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress leads to dopaminergic neuron degeneration in C. elegans,Yiyuan Yuan; Pengxiu Cao; Mark A Smith; Kristopher Kramp; Ying Huang; Naoki Hisamoto; Kunihiro Matsumoto; Maria Hatzoglou; Hui Jin; Zhaoyang Feng,Mutation of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is the leading genetic cause of Parkinson'sDisease (PD); manifested as age-dependent dopaminergic neurodegeneration; but theunderlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Multiple roles of LRRK2 may contributeto dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has also beenlinked to PD pathogenesis; but its interactive mechanism with PD genetic factors is largelyunknown. Here; we used C. elegans; human neuroblastoma cells and murine corticalneurons to determine the role of LRRK2 in maintaining dopaminergic neuron viability. Wefound that LRRK2 acts to protect neuroblastoma cells and C. elegans dopaminergic neuronsfrom the toxicity of 6-hydroxydopamine and/or human α-synuclein; possibly through the p38pathway; by supporting upregulation of GRP78; a key cell survival molecule during ER …,PloS one,2011,41
Endothelial cell-expressed Tim-3 facilitates metastasis of melanoma cells by activating the NF-κB pathway,Feng-Hua Wu; Ye Yuan; Dong Li; Zhang Lei; Chuan-Wang Song; Yan-Yan Liu; Bo Li; Bo Huang; Zuo-Hua Feng; Gui-Mei Zhang,Abstract T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 (Tim-3) is originally recognized as areceptor of Th1 cells. We found that Tim-3 could be expressed in endothelial cells afterstimulation with tumor cell-released TLR4 ligand. Tim-3 expressed by endothelial cells doesnot function as the receptor of galectin-9; but mediates the interaction of endothelial cellswith tumor cells. The engagement of endothelial cell-expressed Tim-3 with a non-galectin 9putative receptor on B16 melanoma cells could trigger the NF-κB signaling pathway in B16cells. The activated NF-κB not only promoted the proliferation of B16 cells; but alsoenhanced apoptosis resistance of B16 cells by up-regulating Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and down-regulating Bax. Consistently; Tim-3 facilitated the survival of B16 cells in the blood stream;arrested in the lung and following invasion; resulted in more metastatic nodules in the …,Oncology reports,2010,39

Enhanced energy metabolism contributes to the extended life span of calorie-restricted Caenorhabditis elegans,Yiyuan Yuan; Chandra S Kadiyala; Tsui-Ting Ching; Parvin Hakimi; Sudipto Saha; Hua Xu; Chao Yuan; Vennela Mullangi; Liwen Wang; Elayne Fivenson; Richard W Hanson; Rob Ewing; Ao-Lin Hsu; Masaru Miyagi; Zhaoyang Feng,Background: How energy metabolism contributes to the extended life span of calorie-restricted animals remains an enigma. Results: We identified enhanced fuel oxidation and apreference of fatty acids as the major energy source in calorie-restricted nematodes.Conclusion: Enhanced fuel utilization rather than total ingested calories contributes to thebeneficial effects of calorie restriction. Significance: Enhanced fuel oxidation to extend lifespan is a conserved mechanism across phylogeny. Abstract Caloric restriction (CR)markedly extends life span and improves the health of a broad number of species. Energymetabolism fundamentally contributes to the beneficial effects of CR; but the underlyingmechanisms that are responsible for this effect remain enigmatic.

PIR1; a novel phosphatase that exhibits high affinity to RNA· ribonucleoprotein complexes,Yu Yuan; Da-Ming Li; Hong Sun,Abstract Protein tyrosine phosphatases are involved in the regulation of important cellularprocesses such as signal transduction; cell cycle progression; and tumor suppression. Herewe report the cloning and characterization of PIR1; a novel member in the dual-specificityphosphatase subfamily of the protein tyrosine phosphatases. PIR1 also contains twostretches of arginine-rich sequences. We have shown that the recombinant PIR1 proteinpossessed an intrinsic phosphatase activity on phosphotyrosine-containing substrate. Aunique feature of this phosphatase is that it binds directly to RNAin vitro with high affinity. Inaddition; we have found that PIR1 interacted with splicing factors 9G8 and SRp30C; possiblythrough an RNA intermediate during a yeast two-hybrid screen. PIR1 exhibited a nuclear-staining pattern that was sensitive to RNase A; but not to DNase I; suggesting that PIR1 in …,Journal of Biological Chemistry,1998,36

Interestingly; the pharmacological effect oftraditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is usually attributed to the drug-interaction property(synergism) of multiple active constituents. Pharmacokinetics is a useful means of evaluatingthe drug interactions of major active compounds in TCM. A simple; sensitive and reliable RP-HPLC-DAD method has been developed to simultaneously quantify 6; 7-dimethylesculetin(D); geniposide (G) and rhein (R); which are the active ingredients in Yin–Chen–Hao–Tang(YCHT); performing drug-interaction pharmacokinetics studies in vivo. Plasma samples wereprepared using methanolic precipitation; a filtration step; and then injection of the methanolicextract onto a Nova-Pak C 18 Guard-Pak™ guard column with a gradient mobile phase …,Biomedical Chromatography,2012,34
Composition‐Tunable Pt–Co Alloy Nanoparticle Networks: Facile Room‐Temperature Synthesis and Supportless Electrocatalytic Applications,You Xu; Yongqiang Yuan; Aijing Ma; Xuan Wu; Yang Liu; Bin Zhang,Abstract Pt–Co alloy nanoparticle networks (NNs) with adjustable composition aresynthesized by co-reduction of H 2 PtCl 6 and CoCl 2 with NaBH 4 in an ethylene glycolassisted cetyltrimethylammonium bromide/water/chloroform system at room temperature.Electrochemical measurements indicate that the as-prepared spongelike Pt–Co NNs exhibitcomposition-dependent electrocatalytic activities and CO tolerance with better durabilitytoward methanol and formic acid oxidation than commercially available Pt/C catalyst. Inparticular; Pt 3 Co NNs show the highest specific activity; while Pt 2 Co NNs exhibit optimalmass activity among Pt–Co alloy NNs with different composition. These Pt–Co alloy NNsmay be promising supportless anode catalysts for the direct methanol and direct formic acidfuel cells.,ChemPhysChem,2012,33
Melatonin enhances the anti-tumor effect of fisetin by inhibiting COX-2/iNOS and NF-κB/p300 signaling pathways,Canhui Yi; Yong Zhang; Zhenlong Yu; Yao Xiao; Jingshu Wang; Huijuan Qiu; Wendan Yu; Ranran Tang; Yuhui Yuan; Wei Guo; Wuguo Deng,Melatonin is a hormone identified in plants and pineal glands of mammals and possessesdiverse physiological functions. Fisetin is a bio-flavonoid widely found in plants and exertsantitumor activity in several types of human cancers. However; the combinational effect ofmelatonin and fisetin on antitumor activity; especially in melanoma treatment; remainsunclear. Here; we tested the hypothesis that melatonin could enhance the antitumor activityof fisetin in melanoma cells and identified the underlying molecular mechanisms. Thecombinational treatment of melanoma cells with fisetin and melatonin significantly enhancedthe inhibitions of cell viability; cell migration and clone formation; and the induction ofapoptosis when compared with the treatment of fisetin alone. Moreover; such enhancementof antitumor effect by melatonin was found to be mediated through the modulation of the …,PloS one,2014,32
Alterations in the transcriptome of porcine oocytes derived from prepubertal and cyclic females is associated with developmental potential,M Paczkowski; Y Yuan; J Fleming-Waddell; CA Bidwell; D Spurlock; RL Krisher,ABSTRACT The developmental competence of oocytes is progressively attained as femalesapproach puberty. The poor quality of prepubertally derived oocytes suggests that essentialprocesses during cytoplasmic maturation have not been completed. The objective of thisexperiment was to identify genes in oocytes that are associated with good (cyclic females)and poor (prepubertal females) developmental competence. Development to the blastocyststage in vitro was significantly decreased in oocytes derived from prepubertal femalescompared with cyclic females (5.26 and 12.86%; respectively). Approximately 10% of theoocyte transcriptome was differentially expressed between in vitro-matured oocytes derivedfrom cyclic and prepubertal females (P< 0.05); 58% of differentially expressed genes hadincreased transcript abundance in oocytes derived from cyclic females.

Implications of intermittent turbulent bursts for sediment resuspension in a coastal bottom boundary layer: A field study in the western Yellow Sea; China,Ye Yuan; Hao Wei; Liang Zhao; Yuenan Cao,Abstract Previous experiments carried out in the laboratory flumes and open channels haveshown that close to the wall sediment resuspension is largely dominated by a sequence ofintermittent; powerful and large-scale motions called coherent structures (or burst cycle)which mainly account for Reynolds stress generation. However; the difficulties insimultaneously measuring the fluctuations of velocities and sediment concentration close tothe seabed during the field observations inhibit the further understanding of this laboratorydiscovery in the marine regime. In the present paper; field data sets collected within acoastal bottom boundary layer (BBL) in the western Yellow Sea are examinedcomprehensively to reveal the relationships between coherent structures and sedimentresuspension. The following results are obtained:(1) the bulk of turbulent sediment flux (c' …,Marine Geology,2009,30
Extracellular HSPA1A promotes the growth of hepatocarcinoma by augmenting tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis-resistance,Feng-Hua Wu; Ye Yuan; Dong Li; Sheng-Jun Liao; Bin Yan; Jing-Jing Wei; Yuan-Hong Zhou; Jian-Hua Zhu; Gui-Mei Zhang; Zuo-Hua Feng,Abstract Intracellular HSP70 has been implicated as a cytoprotective protein; whereas theeffect of extracellular HSP70 on tumor cells has not been fully understood to date. Here wereport that extracellular HSPA1A; a stress-inducible member of HSP70 family; could promotetumor growth. HSPA1A promoted the proliferation of H22 hepatocarcinoma cells throughTLR2 and TLR4 signaling. The effect of HSPA1A was abolished by inhibiting NF-κB.HSPA1A also augmented the apoptosis-resistance of H22 cells by activating NF-κB; thus topromote the proliferation of H22 cells in presence of mitomycin C. Furthermore; thepromoting effect of HSPA1A on tumor cell proliferation was existent after the removal ofHSPA1A; which might involve HSPA1A-promoted upregulation of TLR4 expression in tumorcells and release of HMGB1 from tumor cells. These findings suggest that extracellular …,Cancer letters,2012,28
Genetic screening reveals an essential role of p27kip1 in restriction of breast cancer progression,Yuhui Yuan; Li Qin; Dan Liu; Ray-Chang Wu; Paola Mussi; Suoling Zhou; Zhou Songyang; Jianming Xu,The genetic changes and mechanisms underlying the progression of estrogen-dependentbreast cancers to estrogen-independent; antiestrogen-resistant; and metastatic breastcancers are unclear despite being a major problem in endocrine therapy. To identify genesresponsible for this progression; we carried out a genetic screening by an enhancedretroviral mutagen (ERM)–mediated random mutagenesis in the estrogen-dependent T47Dbreast cancer cells. We found that T47D cells contain only one p27kip1 (p27) allele codingfor the p27 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor. An ERM insertion into the p27 locus ofT47D cells disrupted the p27 gene and created estrogen-independent and antiestrogen-resistant breast cancer cells that still maintained functional estrogen receptors. Disruption ofp27 in T47D cells resulted in several changes; and most of these changes could be …,Cancer research,2007,28

A physical–biological coupled aquaculture model for a suspended aquaculture area of China,Jie Shi; Hao Wei; Liang Zhao; Ye Yuan; Jianguang Fang; Jihong Zhang,Abstract A three-dimensional physical–biological coupled aquaculture model is developedto study the aquaculture carrying capacity of kelp in Sungo Bay; a typical aquaculture site inChina with intensive suspended raft aquaculture. In the aquaculture model; thehydrodynamic module builds on the Princeton Ocean Model by adding two types of dragsdue to the aquaculture facilities at surface and kelp in water column. The biological modulesimulates the renewal of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN); the cycle of phytoplanktonbiomass; and the growth of kelp; while the contribution of bivalves' excretion to DIN is set toa constant derived from observations. Thus; the coupling between the growth of kelp and thecurrent variation can be studied by adding drags in the layers reached by kelp. Thesimulated magnitude and vertical profile of currents agree well with observations. The …,Aquaculture,2011,27
Analysis of four-component seafloor seismic data for seismic anisotropy,Jianxin Yuan,Interest in converted waves (C-waves) has been growing significantly in recent yeas due tothe advent of four-component (4C) ocean-bottom-cable (OBC) seismic recordings. This haschanged the way geophysicists obtain fluid and lithology information about hydrocarbonreservoirs through joint P-and converted-wave analysis. Since 4C OBC surveys useconventional air-gun sources; which generate P-waves only; the shear-waves recorded bythe 4C sensors on the ocean bottom are mode-converted shear-waves. The main focus ofthis thesis is to find ways to process and understand these mode-converted shear-waves inthe presence of seismic anisotropy which is common in marine sediments. To this end; Iexamine and model the data characteristics of 4C seismic data; review the basic theory ofconverted-wave processing; develop new kinematic theories for converted-waves …,*,2001,27
Disrupted redox homeostasis and aberrant redox gene expression in porcine oocytes contribute to decreased developmental competence,Ye Yuan; Matthew B Wheeler; Rebecca L Krisher,Abstract The objective of this study was to identify specific redox-related genes whosefunction contributes to oocyte quality and to characterize the role of redox homeostasis inoocyte development. We determined the redox genes glutaredoxin 2 (GLRX2); proteindisulfide isomerase family A; members 4 and 6 (PDIA4; PDIA 6); and thioredoxin reductase1 (TXNRD1) were differentially expressed between adult (more competent) and prepubertal(less competent) porcine in vitro-matured (IVM) oocytes. The association between thesegenes and oocyte quality was further validated by comparing transcript abundance in IVMwith that in in vivo-matured (VVM) prepubertal and adult oocytes. By maturing oocytes invariable redox environments; we demonstrated that a balanced redox environment isimportant for oocyte quality; and over-reduction of the environment is as detrimental as …,Biology of reproduction,2012,26
IFN‐γ withdrawal after immunotherapy potentiates B16 melanoma invasion and metastasis by intensifying tumor integrin αvβ3 signaling,Wei Gong; Gui‐Mei Zhang; Yi Liu; Zhang Lei; Dong Li; Ye Yuan; Bo Huang; Zuo‐Hua Feng,Abstract Immunotherapy can effectively suppress tumor; yet complete tumor eradicationoccurs infrequently. The metastatic potential of remnant tumor cells after immunotherapy andthe underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here; we report that thetermination of immunotherapy strikingly increases the metastatic potential of remnantmelanoma. This is mainly due to the withdrawal of IFN-γ after immunotherapy. The relief ofIFN-γ stress led to the increase of αvβ3 integrin expression in B16 cells; which increased theadhesion of B16 cells to fibrinogen; fibronectin and laminin. Through αvβ3 signaling; theactivation of FAK; upregulation of cdc2; production of active MMP-2 and MMP-9 and actinpolymerization were intensified in B16 cells stimulated with ECM molecules 24 h after thewithdrawal of IFN-γ. The iv injection of such tumor cells into mice resulted in more …,International journal of cancer,2008,26
Heat shock at the germinal vesicle breakdown stage induces apoptosis in surrounding cumulus cells and reduces maturation rates of porcine oocytes in vitro,Y Yuan; ZD Hao; J Liu; Y Wu; L Yang; GS Liu; JH Tian; SE Zhu; SM Zeng,Abstract The objectives were to determine the effects of cumulus cells (CC) on porcineoocyte maturation in vitro (IVM) after heat shock (HS). Treated oocytes were cultured at 39°C for 20h; followed by HS treatment (42° C for 1h); and then matured in vitro for 23h. The CCwere removed before maturation (H1); after HS (H2); or after maturation (H3). Controloocytes were continuously cultured under the same conditions and CC were similarlyremoved before maturation (C1); after 21h of IVM (C2); and after maturation (C3). Maturationrates were affected by HS (P< 0.01) and by an interaction between HS and CC (P< 0.01). Asignificant decrease in maturation rate only occurred when CC were not removed fromcumulus oocyte complexes during IVM after HS (H3; 39.2±5.7% versus C3; 78.2±8.2%; P<0.01). Mature oocytes in all treatment groups were electrically activated and cultured for 8 …,Theriogenology,2008,26
Melatonin attenuates hypoxic pulmonary hypertension by inhibiting the inflammation and the proliferation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells,Haifeng Jin; Yueyue Wang; Lei Zhou; Lu Liu; Peng Zhang; Wuguo Deng; Yuhui Yuan,Abstract Hypoxia-induced inflammation and excessive proliferation of pulmonary arterysmooth muscle cells (PASMCs) play important roles in the pathological process of hypoxicpulmonary hypertension (HPH). Melatonin possesses anti-inflammatory and antiproliferativeproperties. However; the effect of melatonin on HPH remains unclear. In this study; adultSprague–Dawley rats were exposed to intermittent chronic hypoxia for 4 wk to mimic asevere HPH condition. Hemodynamic and pulmonary pathomorphology data showed thatchronic hypoxia significantly increased right ventricular systolic pressures (RVSP); weight ofthe right ventricle/left ventricle plus septum (RV/LV+ S) ratio; and median width of pulmonaryarterioles. Melatonin attenuated the elevation of RVSP; RV/LV+ S; and mitigated thepulmonary vascular structure remodeling. Melatonin also suppressed the hypoxia …,Journal of pineal research,2014,24

So far; the mechanisms underlying the regulation of theirimmunosuppressive phenotype by classical and alternative macrophage activation stimuliare not well elucidated. In this study; we found that molecules from necrotic tumor cells (NTC-Ms) stimulated Gr-1+ CD11b+ F4/80+ cells to induce apoptosis of activated T cells but notnonstimulated T cells. The apoptosis-inducing capacity was determined by higherexpression levels of arginase I and IL-10 relative to those of NO synthase 2 and IL-12 in Gr-1+ CD11b+ F4/80+ cells; which were induced by NTC-Ms through TLR4 signaling. Theapoptosis-inducing capacity of NTC-Ms–stimulated Gr-1+ CD11b+ F4/80+ cells could beenhanced by IL-10.

Using streptavidin-agarose pulldown and proteomics assay; we identifiedand validated Ku80; a dimer of Ku participating in the repair of broken DNA double strands;as a new binding protein of the COX-2 gene promoter. Overexpression of Ku80 up-regulatedCOX-2 promoter activation and COX-2 expression in lung cancer cells. Silencing of Ku80 bysiRNA down-regulated COX-2 expression and inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro and in axenograft mouse model. Ku80 knockdown suppressed phosphorylation of ERK; resulting inan inactivation of the MAPK pathway. Moreover; CBP; a transcription co-activator; interactedwith and acetylated Ku80 to co-regulate the activation of COX-2 promoter.

Intra-A chain disulphide bond forms first during insulin precursor folding.,Y Yuan; ZH Wang; JG Tang,Abstract In this study; we investigated the folding pathway of insulin precursor and comparedit with that of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). The intra-A chain disulphide bond was foundto form early in insulin precursor folding; whereas the corresponding disulphide bond in IGF-I formed late. Intra-A chain disulphide-bond deleted [A6; A11-Ser] proteins; includingproinsulin; insulin; and A chain; were employed for this investigation. Under the sameconditions the recombination yield of insulin from S-sulphonates of native A and B chainswas 22%; while the yield of [A6; A11-Ser] insulin from S-sulphonates of [A6; A11-Ser] Achain and native B chains was only approx. 7%. This indicated that the intra-A chaindisulphide bond may serve to stabilize the A chain folding intermediate so as to facilitate thecorrect recognition and pairing with the B chain.

Inhibition of hepatocarcinoma and tumor metastasis to liver by gene therapy with recombinant CBD‐HepII polypeptide of fibronectin,Yi Liu; Bo Huang; Ye Yuan; Wei Gong; Han Xiao; Dong Li; Zhi‐Rui Yu; Feng‐Hua Wu; Gui‐Mei Zhang; Zuo‐Hua Feng,Abstract Unlike the intact fibronectin (FN) molecule; some proteolytic or recombinantfragments of FN possess inhibitory activities on tumor; providing potential strategies in tumortherapeutics. Using the hydrodynamics-based gene delivery technique; we demonstratedthat the treatment by in vivo expression of a recombinant CBD-HepII polypeptide of FN;designated as CH50; strongly inhibited the tumor growth; tumor invasion and angiogenesis.Such inhibitory effects of CH50 on tumor were partly ascribed to its influence on the activitiesof MMP-9 and αvβ3 integrin. The in vivo expressed CH50 decreased both the productionand the activity of MMP-9 in tumor tissues. CH50 also down-regulated αvβ3 expression intumor cells and endothelial cells in vitro. The decreased activity of αvβ3 integrin was provedby its reduced binding ability to fibrinogen and the down-regulation of cdc2 expression …,International journal of cancer,2007,20
Effect of ammonium during in vitro maturation on oocyte nuclear maturation and subsequent embryonic development in pigs,Y Yuan; RL Krisher,Abstract The effects of ammonium in a chemically defined maturation medium on oocytenuclear maturation and subsequent embryonic development of pigs after in vitro fertilization(IVF) and parthenogenetic activation (PA) were examined.

Nevertheless;mast cells in tumor microenvironment have been found to promote tumor growth. So far themechanisms underlying the modulation of mast cell function in tumor microenvironmentremains to be fully elucidated. Here; we report that tumor-promoting potential of mast cellscould be augmented by molecules released from damaged tumor cells through cooperativestimulation of stem cell factor (SCF) and ligand for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Co-simulationwith SCF and TLR4 ligand inhibited mast cell degranulation; but efficiently induced theproduction and secretion of VEGF; PDGF; and IL-10. Although TLR4 ligand alone mayinduce IL-12 expression in mast cells; co-stimulation with SCF and TLR4 ligand induced theexpression of IL-10; but not IL-12; in mast cells.

Passive Transfer of Tumour‐Derived MDSCs Inhibits Asthma‐Related Airway Inflammation,C Song; Y Yuan; X‐M Wang; D Li; G‐M Zhang; B Huang; Z‐H Feng,Abstract Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs); a heterogeneous population includingmyeloid progenitor and immature myeloid cells; are known to inhibit T cell responses. Theissue of whether tumour-derived MDSCs regulate the immune response in an asthmaenvironment is currently unclear. Here; we have reported that tumour-derived MDSCs shiftthe balance back to normal in a Th2-dominant asthmatic environment. In an ovalbumin(OVA)-induced mouse asthma model; injected tumour-derived MDSCs were recruited to thelungs of asthmatic mice by CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2). MDSCs transferred intoasthmatic mice via iv injection suppressed the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lung;the Th2 cytokine; IL-4; concentration in bronchial lavage fluid and the serum level of OVA-specific IgE.

Influences of additive on the formation and corrosion resistance of micro-arc oxidation ceramic coatings on aluminum alloy,Yajuan Liu; Jinyong Xu; Ying Gao; Ye Yuan; Cheng Gao,Abstract The influence of Na2WO4 on the forming process and corrosion resistance ofceramic coatings was researched in silicate electrolyte system. The surface morphology andphase composition of ceramic coatings were analyzed by SEM and XRD. The results showthat Na2WO4 can promote the formation of high impedance coatings; reduce the arcing-terminal voltages; and increase the thickness of ceramic coatings. When the concentration ofNa2WO4 is 5 g/L; the arcing voltage is the lowest; the corrosion resistance of ceramiccoatings is improved by 1.6 times compared with the ceramic coatings' in silicate electrolytesystem.,Physics Procedia,2012,16
Pluripotent stem cells from domesticated mammals,Toshihiko Ezashi; Ye Yuan; R Michael Roberts,This review deals with the latest advances in the study of embryonic stem cells (ESC) andinduced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from domesticated species; with a focus on pigs; cattle;sheep; goats; horses; cats; and dogs. Whereas the derivation of fully pluripotent ESC fromthese species has proved slow; reprogramming of somatic cells to iPSC has been morestraightforward. However; most of these iPSC depend on the continued expression of theintroduced transgenes; a major drawback to their utility. The persistent failure in generatingESC and the dependency of iPSC on ectopic genes probably stem from an inability tomaintain the stability of the endogenous gene networks necessary to maintain pluripotency.Based on work in humans and rodents; achievement of full pluripotency will likely requirefine adjustments in the growth factors and signaling inhibitors provided to the cells.

However; the excisemechanism of hTERT regulation during carcinogenesis is not well understood. In this study;we discovered cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 4 (CPSF4) as a novel tumor-specific hTERT promoter-regulating protein in lung cancer cells and identified the roles ofCPSF4 in regulating lung hTERT and lung cancer growth. The ectopic overexpression ofCPSF4 upregulated the hTERT promoter-driven report gene expression and activated theendogenous hTERT mRNA and protein expression and the telomerase activity in lungcancer cells and normal lung cells. In contrast; the knockdown of CPSF4 by siRNA had theopposite effects. CPSF4 knockdown also significantly inhibited tumor cell growth in lung …,Molecular oncology,2014,15
Loss-of-function deletion of the steroid receptor coactivator-1 gene in mice reduces estrogen effect on the vascular injury response,Yuhui Yuan; Jianming Xu,Objective—The steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) is a transcriptional coactivator fornuclear receptors including estrogen receptor (ER). SRC-1 can interact with ER in anestrogen binding-dependent manner to potentiate the transcriptional activity of ER. Previousstudies showed that SRC-1 was required for the full function of ER in cultured cells and inthe reproductive system. In this study; we have tested the hypothesis that SRC-1 is requiredfor the inhibition of neointima formation by estrogen in a vascular wall. Methods and Results—The expression of SRC-1 protein in the vascular wall was examined by immunoblotting andimmunohistochemistry. Wild-type and SRC-1 null mice were ovariectomized; and thenunilateral ligation of the carotid artery was performed to induce neointima growth in thesemice. Mice were treated with placebo or estrogen.

Despite well-characterized enzymaticactivity; the biological functions of this mammalian Sac domain PIPPase family remainlargely unknown. We identified a novel Sac domain-containing protein; rat Sac3 (rSac3);which is widely expressed in various tissues and localized to the endoplasmic reticulum;Golgi complex and recycling endosomes. rSac3 displays PIPPase activity with PI (3) P; PI (4)P and PI (3; 5) P 2 as substrates in vitro; and a mutation in the catalytic core of the Sacdomain abolishes its enzymatic activity. The expression of rSac3 is upregulated duringnerve growth factor (NGF)-stimulated PC12 cell neuronal differentiation; and overexpressionof this protein promotes neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells.

Enhanced Eu3+ emission of Eu2+/Eu3+:(Y0. 9La0. 1) 2O3 transparent ceramics synthesized in H2 atmosphere for modern lighting and display,Cen Jiang; Qiuhong Yang; Shenzhou Lu; Qing Lu; Ye Yuan,Abstract Sintering in reducing atmosphere of H 2 was employed to obtain Eu 2+/Eu 3+ co-existed (Y 0.9 La 0.1) 2 O 3 transparent ceramics. The co-existence of Eu 2+ and Eu 3+ wasobserved in radioluminescence spectrum. Minor content of Eu 2+ is ascribed to the captureof oxygen vacancies for some Eu 3+ ions in reducing atmosphere. Eu 2+ was found to bestimulatory to the emission intensity of Eu 3+. With the presence of Eu 2+; thephotoluminescence intensity of Eu 3+ was greatly enhanced due to the energy transfer fromEu 2+ to Eu 3+. The results showed that Eu 2+/Eu 3+:(Y 0.9 La 0.1) 2 O 3 ceramics with lowcontent of Eu 3+ and minor Eu 2+ have enormous potential to surpass the conventional Eu3+: Y 2 O 3 red phosphors with high content of Eu 3+ and no Eu 2+ in the application ofmodern lighting and display.,Materials Letters,2014,12

Vertical structure of tidal current in a typically coastal raft-culture area,Xing Fan; Hao Wei; Ye Yuan; Liang Zhao,Abstract In this paper vertical structure of tidal current in a typically coastal raft-culture area isdiscussed by field measurement and a numerical model. The observations show that thevertical structure changed dramatically. A tidal surface boundary layer (SBL) is well formeddue to the frictional effects induced by extensive; high-density suspended culture as surfaceobstruction. Both the aquaculture drag and the bottom friction are much higher than those innon-raft-culture areas; and show an obvious variation with tidal flow. The significant earlierebbing and earlier flooding appear in the upper water column instead of the seabed. Andthe maximal phase lag is about 1 h within one tide cycle. A 1D hydrodynamic model wasmodified to include the SBL and parameterized with the field data.

Experimental study on tensile strength of compacted gravel soil,Hui ZHANG; ZHU Jun-gao; WANG Jun-jie,Tensile strength is an important mechanical property of clay soil. It is used seldom inengineering; and there are few studies on it. In fact; there are a number of geotechnicalproblems related to the tensile strength of clay; such as cracking in clay; sliding andhydraulic fracturing in the core of earth dam. Tensile strength tests on three kinds ofcompacted soil samples are carried out. The variations in tensile strength of the soils withthe change of dry density; water content and preconsolidation pressure are investigatedrespectively. The results of the tests indicate that the tensile strength of the soil increaseswith the dry density increasing; and the increment is obvious. On the other hand; with theincrease of the preconsolidation pressure; the tensile strength increases simul-taneously;but the increasing rate is small for the range of the preconsolidation pressure varied from …,Chinese Journal of Rock Mechanics and Engineering,2006,11

The C. elegans taste receptor homolog LITE-1 is a photoreceptor,Jianke Gong; Yiyuan Yuan; Alex Ward; Lijun Kang; Bi Zhang; Zhiping Wu; Junmin Peng; Zhaoyang Feng; Jianfeng Liu; XZ Shawn Xu,Summary Many animal tissues/cells are photosensitive; yet only two types of photoreceptors(ie; opsins and cryptochromes) have been discovered in metazoans. The question arises asto whether unknown types of photoreceptors exist in the animal kingdom. LITE-1; a seven-transmembrane gustatory receptor (GR) homolog; mediates UV-light-induced avoidancebehavior in C. elegans. However; it is not known whether LITE-1 functions as achemoreceptor or photoreceptor. Here; we show that LITE-1 directly absorbs both UVA andUVB light with an extinction coefficient 10–100 times that of opsins and cryptochromes;indicating that LITE-1 is highly efficient in capturing photons. Unlike typical photoreceptorsemploying a prosthetic chromophore to capture photons; LITE-1 strictly depends on itsprotein conformation for photon absorption.

Drawing and writing: An ALE meta-analysis of sensorimotor activations,Ye Yuan; Steven Brown,Abstract Drawing and writing are the two major means of creating what are referred to as“images”; namely visual patterns on flat surfaces. They share many sensorimotor processesrelated to visual guidance of hand movement; resulting in the formation of visual shapesassociated with pictures and words. However; while the human capacity to draw is tens ofthousands of years old; the capacity for writing is only a few thousand years old; andwidespread literacy is quite recent. In order to compare the neural activations for drawingand writing; we conducted two activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses forthese two bodies of neuroimaging literature. The results showed strong overlap in theactivation profiles; especially in motor areas (motor cortex; frontal eye fields; supplementarymotor area; cerebellum; putamen) and several parts of the posterior parietal cortex.

Computer simulation of colloidal aggregation induced by directionalism of long range van der Waals forces,H Xiong; Y Yuan; Hang Li; H Zhu; X Jiang,Colloidal aggregation within the context of long range van der Waals forces was studied bycomputer simulations. The motion of colloidal particles or clusters was guided by the longrange van der Waals forces. Compared to the diffusion limited cluster aggregation (DLCA);which takes no account of the guiding effect; the directionalism of van der Waals forces notonly accelerates the aggregation velocity but also results in morphologies of clusters withhigher density and higher fractal dimensions. The directionalism arising from long range vander Waals forces was very sensitive to the initial concentration of particles. Whether on themorphology or on the aggregating velocity; the directionalism was distinct only at low initialconcentration of particles. The possible reason was that; at a high particle concentrationcondition; both a short average random range and the steric effect of particles may screen …,ACTA PHYSICOCHIMICA SINICA,2007,8

Novel Synthesis of Low Hydroxyl Content Yb3+‐Doped Fluorophosphate Glasses with Long Fluorescence Lifetimes,Ruilin Zheng; Zhongyue Wang; Peng Lv; Ye Yuan; Ying Zhang; Jiajin Zheng; Wei Wei,Abstract A novel dehydration method for preparing rare-earth ions-doped fluorophosphateglasses was presented using raw materials soaking and rapid heating process; and a seriesof water-free Yb 3+-doped fluorophosphate glasses (FPC) were obtained. In contrast withother dehydration methods; we found that the Yb 3+-doped FPC has wide transmissionrange and long fluorescence lifetime. The hydroxyl groups (-OH) absorption was barelyobserved in the range 260–3750 nm; and the UV absorption cut-off wavelength was blueshifted by 100 nm. Under the optimal conditions; the maximum value of emission crosssection and the fluorescence lifetime of FPC reached 0.82 pm 2 and 2.67 ms; respectively.These excellent optical properties implied a potential application of the FPC glass inmulticomponent glass fibers; IR lasers; and optical amplifiers.,Journal of the American Ceramic Society,2015,7

Adeno-associated virus-mediated expression of recombinant CBD–HepII polypeptide of human fibronectin inhibits metastasis of breast cancer,Zhen-Hui He; Zhang Lei; Yan Zhen; Wei Gong; Bo Huang; Ye Yuan; Gui-Mei Zhang; Xiao-Juan Wang; Zuo-Hua Feng,Abstract CH50; a recombinant CBD–HepII polypeptide of human fibronectin; was shown tosuppress tumor metastasis in murine hepatocarcinoma and melanoma models. However;the effect of CH50 on human cancer cells is still not clear. Here we evaluated the efficiencyof CH50 delivered by recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector for breast cancertreatment. Infection of the two human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468with a rAAV2 vector encoding CH50 resulted in secretion of soluble CH50. In vitro rAAV-CH50 transduction inhibited adhesion to ECM molecules; and transwell migration andinvasion of breast cancer cells induced by fibronectin. In both breast cancer cells; rAAV-CH50 targeted α V β3 signaling; namely inhibited the expression of α V β3; the activation ofFAK; the upregulation of cdc2; and the production and activation of MMP-9 by ECM …,Breast cancer research and treatment,2014,7
Dimeric Sfh3 has structural changes in its binding pocket that are associated with a dimer–monomer state transformation induced by substrate binding,Ye Yuan; Wei Zhao; Xiao Wang; Yongxiang Gao; Liwen Niu; Maikun Teng,Phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns); also called phosphoinositides(PIPs); are basic components of membrane-associated signalling systems. A family of PtdIns-transfer proteins (PITPs) called the Sec14 family have been predicted to form a set offunctional modules that can sense different types of lipid metabolism and transmit theinformation to the PIP signalling system. In eukaryotic cells; the Sec14 family exhibits a widediversity of activity; but the structural basis of this diversity remains unclear. In the presentstudy; the dimeric structure of Sfh3 (Sec14 family homologue 3 in yeast) is reported for thefirst time and differs from the Sec14 proteins reported to date; all of which are monomeric.Some variations in the binding pocket of Sfh3 were observed and the dimer interface wasidentified and proposed to provide a link between dimer–monomer state changes and …,Acta Crystallographica Section D: Biological Crystallography,2013,7

However; it is unclear whether the therapeutic efficacy could be influenced bymetastasis-promoting factor (s) in vivo. Here we report that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligandreleased from damaged tumor cells or bacteria had a negative effect on the therapeuticeffect of a recombinant CBD-HepII polypeptide of fibronectin (CH50) that suppresses tumormetastasis by targeting αvβ3. The TLR4 ligand could antagonize the inhibitory effect ofCH50 on tumor cell adhesion and invasion by promoting the expression and activity of αvβ3in tumor cells. The TLR4 ligand also reduced the antimetastasis effect of CH50 by promotingtumor cell survival in circulation. Moreover; TLR4 ligands released by tumor cells incirculation could increase the survival and proliferation capacity of tumor cells after …,Cancer science,2012,7

Kavain inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-α via ERK/LITAF,Xiaoren Tang; Salomon Amar,Kavain; an extract from the shrub Piper methysticum; was recently reported to modulate TNF-α expression in both human and mouse cells via regulation of LPS-Induced TNF-AlphaFactor (LITAF). The purpose of the present study was to define the molecular pathway (s)associated with Kavain′ s effects on TNF modulation. In vitro studies using WT mouseprimary macrophages showed that Kavain significantly reduced E. coli LPS-induced TNF-αproduction but this effect was almost abrogated in LITAF−/− and ERK2−/− cells. Thereforewe reintroduced the ERK2 gene in ERK2−/− cells and partially restored E. coli LPS-inducedLITAF-mediated TNF-α production. The translocation of LITAF into to nucleus was found tobe dependent on ERK2 S206 residue. Kavain inhibits LITAF/TNF-α expression viadephosphorylation of ERK2 in response to E. coli LPS. Finally; in vivo; Kavain had a …,Toxicology research,2016,5

Isotopic labeling of mammalian G protein-coupled receptors heterologously expressed in Caenorhabditis elegans,David Salom; Pengxiu Cao; Yiyuan Yuan; Masaru Miyagi; Zhaoyang Feng; Krzysztof Palczewski,Abstract High-resolution structural determination and dynamic characterization of membraneproteins by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) require their isotopic labeling. Although anumber of labeled eukaryotic membrane proteins have been successfully expressed inbacteria; they lack post-translational modifications and usually need to be refolded frominclusion bodies. This shortcoming of bacterial expression systems is particularly detrimentalfor the functional expression of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs); the largest family ofdrug targets; due to their inherent instability. In this work; we show that proteins expressedby a eukaryotic organism can be isotopically labeled and produced with a quality andquantity suitable for NMR characterization. Using our previously described expressionsystem in Caenorhabditis elegans; we showed the feasibility of labeling proteins …,Analytical biochemistry,2015,5

Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation and risk of stroke,P Stachon; I Ahrens; T Faber; C Bode; A Zirlik,The incidence of atrial fibrillation rises with advancing age. About 10% of patients over 80years suffer from atrial fibrillation; but episodes are often not recognized. However; about25% of cryptogenic strokes are caused by asymptomatic atrial fibrillation showing asignificant risk of thromboembolism by this condition. New insertable cardiac monitors orwearable sensors offer the opportunity of continuous rhythm monitoring over wider timespans. Thereby; they enable detection of asymptomatic atrial fibrillation episodes. Severallines of evidence point towards an association between duration of asymptomatic episodesand thromboembolic risk.

Influence of defocus on automatic focusing evaluation function,Yuan Yu-kai; Cheng Shi-dong; Pei Yun-tian,The focusing process can be divided into three kinds: to adjust the object distance; to adjustthe image distance and to adjust the lens position. All these defocus can enlarge the radiusof dispersive spot and change the transverse magnification (β). Based on the GeometricalOptics; formulas that describe how the radius of dispersive spot and the β depend on thevolume of defocus are established. These influences are separately studied by means ofdigital image process. The simulation result shows that the enlargement of dispersive spothas a symmetrical effect before and after the focal plane; but the β has a monotonedecreasing effect along the axis. So the Focusing Evaluation Function (FEF) becomesasymmetrical before and after the focal plane. As the F-Number gets bigger; the FEFbecomes gentler. As a result; the influence of β gets more evident and the evaluation …,Opto-Electronic Engineering,2005,2

Quadrupling efficiency in production of genetically modified pigs through improved oocyte maturation,Ye Yuan; Lee D Spate; Bethany K Redel; Yuchen Tian; Jie Zhou; Randall S Prather; R Michael Roberts,Abstract Assisted reproductive technologies in all mammals are critically dependent on thequality of the oocytes used to produce embryos. For reasons not fully clear; oocytes maturedin vitro tend to be much less competent to become fertilized; advance to the blastocyst stage;and give rise to live young than their in vivo-produced counterparts; particularly if they arederived from immature females. Here we show that a chemically defined maturation mediumsupplemented with three cytokines (FGF2; LIF; and IGF1) in combination; so-called “FLImedium;” improves nuclear maturation of oocytes in cumulus–oocyte complexes derivedfrom immature pig ovaries and provides a twofold increase in the efficiency of blastocystproduction after in vitro fertilization. Transfer of such blastocysts to recipient females doublesmean litter size to about nine piglets per litter.

Characterization of Vibrio cholerae isolates from 1976 to 2013 in Shandong Province; China,Hui Lü; Yuqi Yuan; Na Sun; Zhenwang Bi; Bing Guan; Kun Shao; Tongzhan Wang; Zhenqiang Bi,Abstract Cholera continues to be a serious public health issue in developing countries. Weanalyzed the epidemiological data of cholera from 1976 to 2013 in Shandong Province; aneastern coastal area of China. A total of 250 Vibrio cholerae isolates were selected for PCRanalysis of virulence genes and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The analysis of thevirulence genes showed that the positive rates for tcpA and tcpI were the highest amongstrains from the southwest region; which had the highest incidence rate of cholera. Lowpositive rates for tcpA; tcpI and ctxAB among isolates from after 2000 may be an influencingfactor contributing to the contemporary decline in cholera incidence rates. Spatiotemporalserotype shifts (Ogawa; Inaba; Ogawa; Inaba and O139) generally correlated with thevariations in the PFGE patterns (PIV; PIIIc; PIa; PIIIb; PIIIa; PIb; and PII).

Efficient long-term cryopreservation of pluripotent stem cells at− 80 C,Ye Yuan; Ying Yang; Yuchen Tian; Jinkyu Park; Aihua Dai; R Michael Roberts; Yang Liu; Xu Han,Abstract Current long term cryopreservation of cell stocks routinely requires the use of liquidnitrogen (LN 2); because commonly used cryopreservation media containing cell membranepermeating cryoprotectants are thermally unstable when frozen at higher storagetemperatures; eg− 80 C. This instability leads to ice recrystallization; causing progressiveloss of cell viability over time under the storage conditions provided by most laboratory deepfreezers. The dependency on LN 2 for cell storage significantly increases operationalexpense and raises issues related to impaired working efficiency and safety. Here wedemonstrate that addition of Ficoll 70 to cryoprotectant solutions significantly improvessystem thermal stability at the working temperature (~− 80 C) of laboratory deep freezers.Moreover; a medium comprised of Ficoll 70 and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in presence …,Scientific reports,2016,1

Capturing bovine pluripotency,Ye Yuan,Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) were successfully isolated and characterized in the early1980s (1; 2); followed by the establishment of ESC from primates more than a decade later(3). However; despite continuous efforts since then; the establishment of ESC lines fromdomesticated species has remained elusive. Over the years; there have been numerous;sometimes contradictory; reports of success from economically important ungulates; such ascattle and pigs; but the general consensus is that no stable; well-characterized ESC linefrom these species presently exists (4). This situation may have now changed. Bogliotti etal.(5) employed fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and a canonical WNT signaling pathwayinhibitor in their culture condition; and derived stable pluripotent cell lines from bovineblastocysts.

The FT-IRspectra of BCTF illustrated the characteristic peaks of the triazine at 1503 cm-1 and 1360 cm-1. The nitrogen sorption isotherm (Type-I) showed a rapid uptake at low pressure (0-0.1 bar)indicating a permanent microporous nature. Pore size distribution lower than 2nm wascalculated using nonlocal density functional theory (NL-DFT). TGA results showed that BCTFpolymer with the skeleton decomposition temperature above 500℃ had relatively excellentthermal stability.,*,2015,*
Experimental Evaluation of Consolidation Behavior of Slipform Paving Concrete Materials,Bo Tian; Sili Li; Feng Yin; Kaimin Niu; Meng Cai; Yezhen Yuan; Jinde Xie,For long-term durability of concrete pavements; it is required that the concrete be adequatelyconsolidated. Proper consolidation increases strength and abrasion resistance; reducespermeability and improves bond to reinforcement or to hardened concrete.Underconsolidation and overconsolidation of concrete can result in weak concrete that maylead to premature failure or loss of serviceability of the pavements. A large-scale fieldsimulation as well as laboratory tests were performed for the purpose of evaluating the effectof vibration on consolidation of concrete under realistic operating conditions that closelysimulated those of slipform pavers. Vibrator frequency; acceleration and air content relativeto the location of the vibrators were analyzed to find out their effects on consolidation ofconcrete. A mini-paver was developed so as to simulate the slipform paving process and …,*,2015,*

Abstract# 3850: Disruption of the SRC-1 gene in mice suppresses breast cancer metastasis without affecting primary tumor formation,Shu Wang; Yuhui Yuan; Lan Liao; Shao-Qing Kuang; Jean Tien; Bert O'Malley; Jianming Xu,The p160 steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family contains three transcriptionalcoactivators; SRC-1/NCOA-1; TIF2/GRIP1/SRC-2/NCOA-2 and AIB1/ACTR/SRC-3/NCOA-3.These SRC coactivators regulate many physiological and pathological events throughpotentiating gene transcription mediated by nuclear hormone receptors such as estrogenand progesterone receptors and certain other transcription factors such as Ets-2 and PEA3.Among the three SRCs; AIB1 is overexpressed in breast cancer; and AIB1 ectopicexpression is sufficient to induce mammary tumorigenesis in mice. We have shown that AIB1deficiency suppresses mammary tumor initiation; growth and metastasis. Although SRC-1 isalso overexpressed in a subpopulation of breast cancer patients; and SRC-1 expression inbreast cancer is associated with HER2 and c-Myc expression and with reduced disease …,*,2009,*
Abstract# 3619: Estrogen receptor/MAPK cross-talk: Implications for radiation resistance of breast cancer,Anupama Munshi; Jenny Liu; Colin Brooks; Yuhui Yuan; Marvette Hobbs; Raymond Meyn,Loss of estrogen receptor (ER) function has been associated with constitutive andhyperactive MAPK (particularly ERK1/2); which culminates in aggressive; metastatic;radiation-resistant cancer. The ERK1/2 pathway has been linked to DNA damage and DNArepair; with multiple proteins involved in DNA repair being transcriptionally regulatedthrough ERK1/2-dependent signaling. An increased DNA repair capacity in ER-\# 945;negative breast tumors has also been implicated as a mechanism of radioresistance. Wehypothesize that the mechanism of development of radiation resistance in the ER-\# 945;negative breast cancer cells involves a dynamic interplay between the ERK1/2 pathway andDNA repair proteins. To test this hypothesis we compared expression levels of ERK1/2 andseveral DNA repair proteins involved in the repair of radiation-induced double strand …,*,2009,*
Abstract# 207: The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) governs the radiation sensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells,Yuhui Yuan; Jenny Liu; Anupama Munshi; Kathleen Jensen; Ashley Roberts; Raymond Meyn,EMT has important roles during embryonic development where it controls tissue remodeling.EMT is also known to be important in cancer where mesenchymal-like tumor cells that haveundergone EMT have lost cell-cell junctions and acquired traits characteristic of malignancy;including the ability to invade and migrate. This loss of cell adhesion is due to a down-regulation of E-cadherin expression at the level of gene transcription. Thus; loss of E-cadherin expression is a hallmark of EMT. It has been reported recently that the EMT statusof NSCLC cells correlates with their sensitivity to inhibitors of the epidermal growth factorreceptor (EGFR). Since there is considerable interest in combining such inhibitors withradiotherapy for the treatment of cancer; we tested whether EMT status also governsradiosensitivity of NSCLC cells. A total of 8 NSCLC cell lines were selected based on …,*,2009,*

A rapid and cost-effective screening method for identification of targeted embryonic stem cells.,L Liao; SQ Kuang; YH Yuan; JM Xu,Abstract Generation and characterization of knockout mice from targeted embryonic stem(ES) cells have become one of the most powerful approaches to study gene function in vivo.However; experiments to identify targeted ES clones can be both labor-intensive andexpensive when the targeting efficiency is low. Using the steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3) gene as a model; we have developed a rapid and cost-effective method for identificationof targeted ES clones. Specifically; a promoterless LacZ sequence was fused to the 5'-coding sequence of SRC-3 in the targeting vector. After homologous recombination in EScells; LacZ expression was regulated by the endogenous gene promoter. In cases ofrandom insertions the beta-galactosidase would more likely not be produced due to lackingpromoter or missing amino acid-reading frame.

EFFECT OF AMMONIUM DURING IN VITRO MATURATION ON PORCINE OOCYTE NUCLEAR MATURATION AND SUBSEQUENT EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT,Ye Yuan; Rebecca L Krisher,Abstract The effects of ammonium in a chemically defined maturation medium on porcineoocyte nuclear maturation and subsequent embryonic development after in vitro fertilization(IVF) and parthenogenetic activation (PA) were examined. Cumulusoocyte complexes werematured in Purdue Porcine Medium (PPM) supplemented with 0 mM; 0.02 mM; 0.2 mM; 2mM; or 20 mM ammonium chloride; or TCM199 with 10% porcine follicle fluid (TCM+ pFF;positive control) at 38.7 C in 7% CO2 in air for 40-44 hr. No significant difference (P> 0.05) innuclear maturation was found between oocytes matured in TCM+ pFF or PPM with 0 mM;0.02 mM and 0.2 mM ammonium chloride. However; nuclear maturation was significantlydecreased (P< 0.05) in oocytes matured in PPM with 2 mM or 20 mM ammonium. After IVF;oocytes matured in PPM with 20 mM ammonium resulted in embryos with significantly …,GENOMIC STUDIES OF OOCYTE PHYSIOLOGY REVEAL MECHANISMS CRITICAL TO OOCYTE COMPETENCE,*,*
DISRUPTED REDOX HOMEOSTASIS AND ABERRANT REDOX GENE EXPRESSION PATTERNS IN PREPUBERTAL PORCINE OOCYTES CONTRIBUTE TO DEC...,Ye Yuan; Rebecca L Krisher,Abstract There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that redox homeostasis in oocytesis closely related to developmental competence; however; the underlying mechanisms areunclear. The objective of this study was to identify specific redox related genes whosefunction contributes to oocyte competence; and characterize the role of redox homeostasisin oocyte competence. We determined that the redox genes GLRX2; PDIA4; PDIA6 andTRXR1 were differentially expressed between adult (more competent) and prepubertal (lesscompetent) porcine in vitro matured (IVM) oocytes. These genes were further validated bycomparing transcript abundance in IVM and in vivo matured (VVM) prepubertal and adultporcine oocytes. Differential expression of these genes suggested that they may befunctionally relevant to oocyte competence. By maturing oocytes in different redox …,GENOMIC STUDIES OF OOCYTE PHYSIOLOGY REVEAL MECHANISMS CRITICAL TO OOCYTE COMPETENCE,*,*
