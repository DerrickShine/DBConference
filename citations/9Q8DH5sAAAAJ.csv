TRUESET: Faster Verifiable Set Computations.,Ahmed E Kosba; Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Charalampos Papamanthou; Mahmoud F Sayed; Elaine Shi; Nikos Triandopoulos,Abstract Verifiable computation (VC) enables thin clients to efficiently verify thecomputational results produced by a powerful server. Although VC was initially consideredto be mainly of theoretical interest; over the last two years impressive progress has beenmade on implementing VC. Specifically; we now have open-source implementations of VCsystems that handle all classes of computations expressed either as circuits or in the RAMmodel. Despite this very encouraging progress; new enhancements in the design andimplementation of VC protocols are required to achieve truly practical VC for real-worldapplications. In this work; we show that for functions that can be expressed efficiently interms of set operations (eg; a subset of SQL queries) VC can be enhanced to becomedrastically more practical: We present the design and prototype implementation of a novel …,USENIX Security Symposium,2014,35
Verifiable Set Operations over Outsourced Databases,Ran Canetti; Omer Paneth; Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Nikos Triandopoulos,Abstract We study the problem of verifiable delegation of computation over outsourced data;whereby a powerful worker maintains a large data structure for a weak client in a verifiableway. Compared to the well-studied problem of verifiable computation; this setting imposesadditional difficulties since the verifier also needs to check the consistency of updatessuccinctly and without maintaining large state. We present a scheme for verifiable evaluationof hierarchical set operations (unions; intersections and set-differences) applied to acollection of dynamically changing sets of elements from a given domain. The verificationcost incurred is proportional only to the size of the final outcome set and to the size of thequery; and is independent of the cardinalities of the involved sets. The cost of updates isoptimal (involving O (1) modular operations per update). Our construction extends that of …,Public Key Cryptography 2014,2014,30
NSEC5: Provably Preventing DNSSEC Zone Enumeration,Sharon Goldberg; Moni Naor; Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Vasant Sachin Reyzin; Leonid; Asaf Ziv,Abstract—We use cryptographic techniques to study zone enumeration in DNSSEC.DNSSEC is designed to prevent attackers from tampering with domain name system (DNS)messages. The cryptographic machinery used in DNSSEC; however; also creates a newvulnerability; zone enumeration; enabling an adversary to use a small number of onlineDNSSEC queries combined with offline dictionary attacks to learn which domain names arepresent or absent in a DNS zone. We prove that the current DNSSEC standard; with NSECand NSEC3 records; inherently suffers from zone enumeration: specifically; we show thatsecurity against (1) attackers that tamper with DNS messages and (2) privacy against zoneenumeration cannot be satisfied simultaneously; unless the DNSSEC nameserver performsonline public-key cryptographic operations.,NDSS,2015,29
Practical Authenticated Pattern Matching with Optimal Proof Size,Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Charalampos Papamanthou; Roberto Tamassia; Nikolaos Triandopoulos,Abstract We address the problem of authenticating pattern matching queries over textualdata that is outsourced to an untrusted cloud server. By employing cryptographicaccumulators in a novel optimal integrity-checking tool built directly over a suffix tree; wedesign the first authenticated data structure for verifiable answers to pattern matchingqueries featuring fast generation of constant-size proofs. We present two main applicationsof our new construction to authenticate:(i) pattern matching queries over text documents; and(ii) exact path queries over XML documents. Answers to queries are verified by proofs of sizeat most 500 bytes for text pattern matching; and at most 243 bytes for exact path XML search;independently of the document or answer size. By design; our authentication schemes canalso be parallelized to offer extra efficiency during data outsourcing. We provide a …,PVLDB 2015,2015,12

Taking Authenticated Range Queries to Arbitrary Dimensions,Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Stavros Papadopoulos; Nikos Triandopoulos,Abstract We study the problem of authenticated multi-dimensional range queries overoutsourced databases; where an owner outsources its database to an untrusted server;which maintains it and answers queries to clients. Previous schemes either scaleexponentially in the number of query dimensions; or rely on heuristic data structures withoutprovable bounds. Most importantly; existing work requires an exponential; in the databaseattributes; number of structures to support queries on every possible combination ofdimensions in the database. In this paper; we propose the first schemes that (i) scale linearlywith the number of dimensions; and (ii) support queries on any set of dimensions with linearin the number of attributes setup cost and storage. We achieve this through an elaboratefusion of novel and existing set-operation sub-protocols. We prove the security of our …,ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security 2014,2014,10
Combining Traditional Map Labeling with Boundary Labeling,Michael Bekos; Michael Kaufmann; Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Antonios Symvonis,Abstract The traditional map labeling problems are mostly NP-hard. Hence; effectiveheuristics and approximations have been developed in the past. Recently; efficientalgorithms for the so-called boundary labeling model have been introduced which assumesthat the labels are placed on the boundary of the map and connected by polygonal leadersto their corresponding sites. Internal labels have been forbidden. In this paper; we allowboth. Since clearly internal labels should be preferred; we consider several maximizationproblems for the number of internal labels and we show that they can be obtained efficientlyor in quasi-polynomial time.,SOFSEM 2011,2011,9

Zero-Knowledge Accumulators and Set Algebra,Esha Ghosh; Olga Ohrimenko; Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Roberto Tamassia; Nikos Triandopoulos,Abstract Cryptographic accumulators allow to succinctly represent a set by an accumulationvalue with respect to which short (non-) membership proofs about the set can be efficientlyconstructed and verified. Traditionally; their security captures soundness but offers noprivacy: Convincing proofs reliably encode set membership; but they may well leakinformation about the accumulated set. In this paper we put forward a strong privacy-preserving enhancement by introducing and devising zero-knowledge accumulators thatadditionally provide hiding guarantees: Accumulation values and proofs leak nothing abouta dynamic set that evolves via element insertions/deletions. We formalize the new propertyusing the standard real-ideal paradigm; namely demanding that an adaptive adversary withaccess to query/update oracles; cannot tell whether he interacts with honest protocol …,International Conference on the Theory and Application of Cryptology and Information Security,2016,6
NSEC5 from Elliptic Curves: Provably Preventing DNSSEC Zone Enumeration with Shorter Responses.,Sharon Goldberg; Moni Naor; Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Leonid Reyzin,Abstract: While DNSSEC securely provides authenticity and integrity to the domain namesystem (DNS); it also creates a new security vulnerability called zone enumeration thatallows an adversary that asks a small number of targeted DNS queries to learn the IPaddresses of all domain names in a zone. An enumerated zone can be used as''a source ofprobable e-mail addresses for spam; or as a key for multiple WHOIS queries to revealregistrant data that many registries may have legal obligations to protect''[RFC 5155](eg; perEU data protection laws); or to create a toehold for more complex attacks. As the Internet ofthings becomes increasingly ubiquitous; it also becomes increasingly important to keep thenames and addresses of these''things''(eg; thermostats; fridges; baby monitors) away fromremote attackers.

A Zero-Knowledge Version of vSQL,Yupeng Zhang; Daniel Genkin; Jonathan Katz; Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Charalampos Papamanthou,Abstract Zero-knowledge arguments of knowledge are powerful cryptographic primitives thatallow a computationally strong prover to convince a weaker verifier for the validity of a an NPstatement; without revealing anything about the corresponding witness (beyond itsexistence). All state-of-the art implementations of such arguments follow the quadraticarithmetic program paradigm. One notable exception to this is the vSQL system of [Zhang etal. IEEE S&P 2017] which takes an entirely different approach resulting is significantly lesscryptographic operations. However; it has the notable downside that is not zero-knowledge(ie; it does not hide the witness from the verifier); a property that has proven to be of utmostimportance in many application (eg; in cryptocurrencies). In this work; we present a zero-knowledge version of the argument upon which vSQL is based. Our construction utilizes …,*,2017,2
Can NSEC5 be practical for DNSSEC deployments?,Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Duane Wessels; Shumon Huque; Moni Naor; Jan Vcelák; Leonid Reyzin; Sharon Goldberg,ABSTRACT NSEC5 is a new proposal for providing authenticated denial of existence forDNSSEC; ie; for securely responding to DNS queries for names that do not exist in a zone.NSEC5 simultaneously guarantees two security properties:(1) privacy against zoneenumeration; and (2) integrity of zone contents; even if an adversary compromises theauthoritative nameserver responsible for responding to DNS queries for the zone. Bycontrast; today's DNSSEC protocol can guarantee one of these properties; but not both. Thispaper argues that NSEC5 not only improves DNS security; but is also practical andperformant. To that end; we present a new version of NSEC5 that uses elliptic curvecryptography to achieve small DNSSEC responses and fast queryprocessing times. We alsoextend widely-used DNS software to present the first implementations of NSEC5 for an …,IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive,2017,2
Secure Computation in Online Social Networks.,Foteini Baldimtsi; Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Stavros Papadopoulos; Alessandra Scafuro; Nikos Triandopoulos,Abstract Apart from their numerous other benefits; online social networks (OSNs) allow usersto jointly compute on each other's data (eg; profiles; geo-locations; medical records; etc.).Privacy issues naturally arise in this setting due to the sensitive nature of the exchangedinformation. Ideally; nothing about a user's data should be revealed to the OSN provider or“non-friend” users; and even her “friends” should only learn the output of a joint computation.In this work we propose the first security framework to capture these strong privacyguarantees for general-purpose computation. We also achieve two additional attractiveproperties: users do not need to be online while their friends compute on their data; and anyuser value uploaded at the server can be repeatedly used in multiple computations.

Stretching NSEC3 to the Limit: Efficient Zone Enumeration Attacks on NSEC3 Variants,Sharon Goldberg; Moni Naor; Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Leonid Reyzin; Sachin Vasant; Asaf Ziv,Recently; in a paper proposing NSEC5; a denial of existence mechanism for DNSSEC [3]; wealso proved that security against (1) network attackers that tamper with DNS messages and(2) privacy against zone enumeration cannot be satisfied simultaneously; unless the DNSSECnameserver performs online public-key cryptographic operations for each denial- of-existenceresponse it sends. This explains why NSEC3 with precomputed responses is vulnerable to zoneenumeration; indeed; zone enumeration attacks have been demonstrated by Bernstein [2] andWander et al. [6]. More importantly; our results in [3] show that any hash-based denial of existencescheme that provides integrity against network attackers will still be vulnerable to zoneenumeration. Nevertheless; one might still be tempted to attempt to modify NSEC3 using onlyhash- based techniques; in order to make zone enumeration more difficult. We …,*,2015,1
vRAM: Faster verifiable RAM with program-independent preprocessing,Yupeng Zhang; Daniel Genkin; Jonathan Katz; Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Charalampos Papamanthou,Abstract—We study the problem of verifiable computation (VC) for RAM programs; where acomputationally weak verifier outsources the execution of a program to a powerful (butuntrusted) prover. Existing efficient implementations of VC protocols require an expensivepreprocessing phase that binds the parties to a single circuit.(While there are schemes thatavoid preprocessing entirely; their performance remains significantly worse thanconstructions with preprocessing.) Thus; a prover and verifier are forced to choose betweentwo approaches:(1) Allow verification of arbitrary RAM programs; at the expense ofefficiency; by preprocessing a universal circuit which can handle all possible instructionsduring each CPU cycle; or (2) Sacrifice expressiveness by preprocessing an efficient circuitwhich is tailored to the verification of a single specific RAM program.

Server-Aided Secure Computation with Off-line Parties,Foteini Baldimtsi; Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Stavros Papadopoulos; Alessandra Scafuro; Nikos Triandopoulos,Abstract Online social networks (OSNs) allow users to jointly compute on each other's data(eg; profiles; geo-locations; etc.). Privacy issues naturally arise in this setting due to thesensitive nature of the exchanged information. Ideally; nothing about a user's data should berevealed to the OSN provider or non-friends; and even her friends should only learn theoutput of a specific computation. A natural approach for achieving these strong privacyguarantees is via secure multi-party computation (MPC). However; existing MPC-basedapproaches do not capture two key properties of OSN setting: Users does not need to beonline while their friends query the OSN server on their data; and; once uploaded; user'sdata can be repeatedly queried by the server on behalf of user's friends. In this work; wepresent two concrete MPC constructions that achieve these properties. The first is an …,European Symposium on Research in Computer Security,2017,*
Authenticated hierarchical set operations and applications,*,Methods and apparatus are provided for authenticated hierarchical set operations. A thirdparty server processes a query (possibly from a client) on data sets outsourced by a sourceof the data. The query comprises a hierarchical set operation between at least two of thedata sets. Authenticated Set Operation techniques for flat set operations can be iterativelyapplied for hierarchical set operations. In addition; bilinear accumulators are extended toprovide an extractable accumulation scheme comprising a primary bilinear accumulator anda secondary bilinear accumulator. The client receives (i) an encoding of an answer to thequery;(ii) a verification comprising; for example; one or more of subset witnesses;completeness witnesses; and/or accumulation values; and (iii) at least one argument for atleast one intersection operation; union operation and/or set difference operation.,*,2016,*

Searchable Encryption with Optimal Locality: Achieving Sublogarithmic Read Efficiency,Ioannis Demertzis; Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Charalampos Papamanthou,Abstract. We propose the first linear-space searchable encryption scheme with constantlocality and sublogarithmic read efficiency; strictly improving the previously best known readefficiency bound (Asharov et al.; STOC 2016) from Θ (log N log log N) to O (logγ N) where γ=2 3+ δ for any fixed δ> 0. Our scheme employs four different allocation algorithms for storingthe keyword lists; depending on the size of the list considered each time. For ourconstruction we develop (i) new probability bounds for the offline two-choice allocationproblem;(ii) and a new I/O-efficient oblivious RAM with O (n1/3) bandwidth overhead andzero failure probability; both of which can be of independent interest.,*,*,*

Stateful Multi-Client Verifiable Computation,Christian Cachin; Esha Ghosh; Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Björn Tackmann,Abstract. This paper develops a cryptographic protocol for outsourcing arbitrary statefulcomputation among multiple clients to an untrusted server; while guaranteeing integrity ofthe data. The clients communicate only with the server and store only a short authenticator toensure that the server does not cheat. Our contribution is two-fold. First; we extend the recenthash&prove scheme of Fiore et al.(CCS 2016) to stateful computations that support arbitraryupdates by the untrusted server; in a way that can be verified by the clients. We use thisscheme to generically instantiate authenticated data types. Second; we describe a protocolfor multi-client verifiable computation based on an authenticated data type; and prove that itachieves a computational version of fork linearizability. This is the strongest guarantee thatcan be achieved in the setting where clients do not communicate directly; it ensures …,*,*,*
Measuring the Performance Impact of NSEC5,Sharon Goldberg; Moni Naor; Dimitrios Papadopoulos; Leonid Reyzin; Jan Vcelák,While DNSSEC provides authenticity and integrity to the domain name system (DNS); it alsointroduces a new vulnerability—zone enumeration [12; 5; 4; 19]—which allows an adversarythat asks a small number of targeted DNS queries (one per record in the zone) to discoverthe full contents of a zone.
