From region encoding to extended dewey: On efficient processing of XML twig pattern matching,Jiaheng Lu; Tok Wang Ling; Chee-Yong Chan; Ting Chen,Abstract Finding all the occurrences of a twig pattern in an XML database is a core operationfor efficient evaluation of XML queries. A number of algorithms have been proposed toprocess a twig query based on region encoding labeling scheme. While region encodingsupports efficient determination of structural relationship between two elements; we observethat the information within a single label is very limited. In this paper; we propose a newlabeling scheme; called extended Dewey. This is a powerful labeling scheme; since from thelabel of an element alone; we can derive all the elements names along the path from theroot to the element. Based on extended Dewey; we design a novel holistic twig joinalgorithm; called TJFast. Unlike all previous algorithms based on region encoding; toanswer a twig query; TJFast only needs to access the labels of the leaf query nodes …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,379
Efficient merging and filtering algorithms for approximate string searches,Chen Li; Jiaheng Lu; Yiming Lu,We study the following problem: how to efficiently find in a collection of strings those similarto a given query string? Various similarity functions can be used; such as edit distance;Jaccard similarity; and cosine similarity. This problem is of great interests to a variety ofapplications that need a high real-time performance; such as data cleaning; queryrelaxation; and spellchecking. Several algorithms have been proposed based on the idea ofmerging inverted lists of grams generated from the strings. In this paper we make twocontributions. First; we develop several algorithms that can greatly improve the performanceof existing algorithms. Second; we study how to integrate existing filtering techniques withthese algorithms; and show that they should be used together judiciously; since the way todo the integration can greatly affect the performance. We have conducted experiments on …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,281
On boosting holism in XML twig pattern matching using structural indexing techniques,Ting Chen; Jiaheng Lu; Tok Wang Ling,Abstract Searching for all occurrences of a twig pattern in an XML document is an importantoperation in XML query processing. Recently a holistic method TwigStack.[2] has beenproposed. The method avoids generating large intermediate results which do not contributeto the final answer and is CPU and I/O optimal when twig patterns only have ancestor-descendant relationships. Another important direction of XML query processing is to buildstructural indexes [3][8][13][15] over XML documents to avoid unnecessary scanning ofsource documents. We regard XML structural indexing as a technique to partition XMLdocuments and call it streaming scheme in our paper. In this paper we develop a method toperform holistic twig pattern matching on XML documents partitioned using variousstreaming schemes. Our method avoids unnecessary scanning of irrelevant portion of …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,253
Effective xml keyword search with relevance oriented ranking,Zhifeng Bao; Tok Wang Ling; Bo Chen; Jiaheng Lu,Inspired by the great success of information retrieval (IR) style keyword search on the web;keyword search on XML has emerged recently. The difference between text database andXML database results in three new challenges:(1) Identify the user search intention; ieidentify the XML node types that user wants to search for and search via.(2) Resolvekeyword ambiguity problems: a keyword can appear as both a tag name and a text value ofsome node; a keyword can appear as the text values of different XML node types and carrydifferent meanings.(3) As the search results are sub-trees of the XML document; new scoringfunction is needed to estimate its relevance to a given query. However; existing methodscannot resolve these challenges; thus return low result quality in term of query relevance.

Efficient processing of XML twig patterns with parent child edges: a look-ahead approach,Jiaheng Lu; Ting Chen; Tok Wang Ling,Abstract With the growing importance of semi-structure data in information exchange; muchresearch has been done to provide an effective mechanism to match a twig query in an XMLdatabase. A number of algorithms have been proposed recently to process a twig queryholistically. Those algorithms are quite efficient for quires with only ancestor-descendantedges. But for queries with mixed ancestor-descendant and parent-child edges; the previousapproaches still may produce large intermediate results; even when the input and outputsize are more manageable. To overcome this limitation; in this paper; we propose a novelholistic twig join algorithm; namely< i> TwigStackList</i>. Our main technique is to look-ahead read some elements in input data steams and cache limited number of them to< i>lists</i> in the main memory. The number of elements in any list is bounded by the length …,Proceedings of the thirteenth ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2004,200
Reverse spatial and textual k nearest neighbor search,Jiaheng Lu; Ying Lu; Gao Cong,Abstract Geographic objects associated with descriptive texts are becoming prevalent. Thisgives prominence to spatial keyword queries that take into account both the locations andtextual descriptions of content. Specifically; the relevance of an object to a query ismeasured by spatial-textual similarity that is based on both spatial proximity and textualsimilarity. In this paper; we define Reverse Spatial Textual k Nearest Neighbor (RSTkNN)query; ie; finding objects that take the query object as one of their k most spatial-textualsimilar objects. Existing works on reverse kNN queries focus solely on spatial locations butignore text relevance. To answer RSTkNN queries efficiently; we propose a hybrid index treecalled IUR-tree (Intersection-Union R-Tree) that effectively combines location proximity withtextual similarity. Based on the IUR-tree; we design a branch-and-bound search algorithm …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,134

Space-constrained gram-based indexing for efficient approximate string search,Alexander Behm; Shengyue Ji; Chen Li; Jiaheng Lu,Answering approximate queries on string collections is important in applications such asdata cleaning; query relaxation; and spell checking; where inconsistencies and errors existin user queries as well as data. Many existing algorithms use gram-based inverted-listindexing structures to answer approximate string queries. These indexing structures are"notoriously" large compared to the size of their original string collection. In this paper; westudy how to reduce the size of such an indexing structure to a given amount of space; whileretaining ef¿ cient query processing. We¿ rst study how to adopt existing inverted-listcompression techniques to solve our problem.

An efficient multi-dimensional index for cloud data management,Xiangyu Zhang; Jing Ai; Zhongyuan Wang; Jiaheng Lu; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract Recently; the cloud computing platform is getting more and more attentions as anew trend of data management. Currently there are several cloud computing products thatcan provide various services. However; currently the cloud platforms only support simplekeyword-based queries and can't answer complex queries efficiently due to lack of efficientindex techniques. In this paper we propose an efficient approach to build multi-dimensionalindex for Cloud computing system. We use the combination of R-tree and KD-tree toorganize data records and offer fast query processing and efficient index maintenance. Ourapproach can process typical multi-dimensional queries including point queries and rangequeries efficiently.

Extended xml tree pattern matching: theories and algorithms,Jiaheng Lu; Tok Wang Ling; Zhifeng Bao; Chen Wang,As business and enterprises generate and exchange XML data more often; there is anincreasing need for efficient processing of queries on XML data. Searching for theoccurrences of a tree pattern query in an XML database is a core operation in XML queryprocessing. Prior works demonstrate that holistic twig pattern matching algorithm is anefficient technique to answer an XML tree pattern with parent-child (PC) and ancestor-descendant (AD) relationships; as it can effectively control the size of intermediate resultsduring query processing. However; XML query languages (eg; XPath and XQuery) definemore axes and functions such as negation function; order-based axis; and wildcards.

Efficient processing of ordered XML twig pattern,Jiaheng Lu; Tok Wang Ling; Tian Yu; Changqing Li; Wei Ni,Abstract Finding all the occurrences of a twig pattern in an XML database is a core operationfor efficient evaluation of XML queries. Holistic twig join algorithm has showed its superiorityover binary decompose based approach due to efficient reducing intermediate results. Theexisting holistic join algorithms; however; cannot deal with ordered twig queries. Astraightforward approach that first matches the unordered twig queries and then prunesaway the undesired answers is obviously not optimal in most cases. In this paper; we study anovel holistic-processing algorithm; called OrderedTJ; for ordered twig queries. We showthat OrderedTJ can identify a large query class to guarantee the I/O optimality.

This paperpresents the first system that clusters Web video search results by fusing the evidences froma variety of information sources besides the video content such as title; tags and description.We propose a novel framework that can integrate multiple features and enable us to adoptexisting clustering algorithms.

Method and apparatus for improving performance of approximate string queries using variable length high-quality grams,*,A computer process; called VGRAM; improves the performance of these string searchalgorithms in computers by using a carefully chosen dictionary of variable-length gramsbased on their frequencies in the string collection. A dynamic programming algorithm forcomputing a tight lower bound on the number of common grams shared by two similarstrings in order to improve query performance is disclosed. A method for automaticallycomputing a dictionary of high-quality grams for a workload of queries. Improvement onquery performance is achieved by these techniques by a cost-based quantitative approachto deciding good grams for approximate string queries.

Indexing and querying XML using extended Dewey labeling scheme,Jiaheng Lu; Xiaofeng Meng; Tok Wang Ling,Abstract Finding all the occurrences of a tree pattern in an XML database is a core operationfor efficient evaluation of XML queries. The Dewey labeling scheme is commonly used tolabel an XML document to facilitate XML query processing by recording information on thepath of an element. In order to improve the efficiency of XML tree pattern matching; weintroduce a novel labeling scheme; called extended Dewey; which effectively extends theexisting Dewey labeling scheme to combine the types and identifiers of elements in a label;and to avoid the scan of labels for internal query nodes to accelerate query processing (inI/O cost). Based on extended Dewey; we propose a series of holistic XML tree patternmatching algorithms. We first present TJFast to answer an XML twig pattern query. Toefficiently answer a generalized XML tree pattern; we then propose GTJFast; an …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2011,36
Labeling and querying dynamic XML trees,Jiaheng Lu; Tok Wang Ling,Abstract With the growing importance of XML in data exchange; much research tends toprovide a compact labeling scheme and a flexible query facility to extract data from dynamicXML trees. In this paper; we first propose GRP; namely GRoup based Prefix labelingscheme. Compared to the previous labeling schemes; the total size of labels in GRP is muchshorter. Experiment results with synthetic and real life data show that the size of labels withGRP is about 2%-10% of that with the previous labeling scheme. Based on GRP; we furtherpropose GRJ (GRoup based structural Join); a structural join algorithm. GRJ is similar to thehash join algorithm in RDBMS and needs to scan the join data only twice. Furthermore;unlike other structural join algorithms; GRJ can perform efficiently without dependency onthe join data sorted or indexed; for the data in the dynamic XML trees are usually …,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2004,36
Best Keyword Cover Search.,Ke Deng; Xin Li; Jiaheng Lu; Xiaofang Zhou,It is common that the objects in a spatial database (eg; restaurants/hotels) are associatedwith keyword (s) to indicate their businesses/services/features. An interesting problemknown as Closest Keywords search is to query objects; called keyword cover; whichtogether cover a set of query keywords and have the minimum inter-objects distance. Inrecent years; we observe the increasing availability and importance of keyword rating inobject evaluation for the better decision making. This motivates us to investigate a genericversion of Closest Keywords search called Best Keyword Cover which considers inter-objects distance as well as the keyword rating of objects. The baseline algorithm is inspiredby the methods of Closest Keywords search which is based on exhaustively combiningobjects from different query keywords to generate candidate keyword covers.

String similarity measures and joins with synonyms,Jiaheng Lu; Chunbin Lin; Wei Wang; Chen Li; Haiyong Wang,Abstract A string similarity measure quantifies the similarity between two text strings forapproximate string matching or comparison. For example; the strings" Sam" and" Samuel"can be considered similar. Most existing work that computes the similarity of two strings onlyconsiders syntactic similarities; eg; number of common words or q-grams. While these areindeed indicators of similarity; there are many important cases where syntactically differentstrings can represent the same real-world object. For example;" Bill" is a short form of"William". Given a collection of predefined synonyms; the purpose of the paper is to exploresuch existing knowledge to evaluate string similarity measures more effectively andefficiently; thereby boosting the quality of string matching. In particular; we first present anexpansion-based framework to measure string similarities efficiently while considering …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,32

MRTuner: a toolkit to enable holistic optimization for mapreduce jobs,Juwei Shi; Jia Zou; Jiaheng Lu; Zhao Cao; Shiqiang Li; Chen Wang,Abstract MapReduce based data-intensive computing solutions are increasingly deployedas production systems. Unlike Internet companies who invent and adopt the technology fromthe very beginning; traditional enterprises demand easy-to-use software due to the limitedcapabilities of administrators. Automatic job optimization software for MapReduce is apromising technique to satisfy such requirements. In this paper; we introduce a toolkit fromIBM; called MRTuner; to enable holistic optimization for MapReduce jobs. In particular; wepropose a novel Producer-Transporter-Consumer (PTC) model; which characterizes thetradeoffs in the parallel execution among tasks. We also carefully investigate thecomplicated relations among about twenty parameters; which have significant impact on thejob performance.

An effective object-level XML keyword search,Zhifeng Bao; Jiaheng Lu; Tok Wang Ling; Liang Xu; Huayu Wu,Abstract Keyword search is widely recognized as a convenient way to retrieve informationfrom XML data. In order to precisely meet users' search concerns; we study how to effectivelyreturn the targets that users intend to search for. We model XML document as a set ofinterconnected object-trees; where each object contains a subtree to represent a concept inthe real world. Based on this model; we propose object-level matching semantics calledInterested Single Object (ISO) and Interested Related Object (IRO) to capture single objectand multiple objects as user's search targets respectively; and design a novel relevanceoriented ranking framework for the matching results. We propose efficient algorithms tocompute and rank the query results in one phase. Finally; comprehensive experiments showthe efficiency and effectiveness of our approach; and an online demo of our system on …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,28
Efficient algorithms and cost models for reverse spatial-keyword k-nearest neighbor search,Ying Lu; Jiaheng Lu; Gao Cong; Wei Wu; Cyrus Shahabi,Abstract Geographic objects associated with descriptive texts are becoming prevalent;justifying the need for spatial-keyword queries that consider both locations and textualdescriptions of the objects. Specifically; the relevance of an object to a query is measured byspatial-textual similarity that is based on both spatial proximity and textual similarity. In thisarticle; we introduce the Reverse Spatial-Keyword k-Nearest Neighbor (RSKkNN) query;which finds those objects that have the query as one of their k-nearest spatial-textualobjects. The RSKkNN queries have numerous applications in online maps and GIS decisionsupport systems.

Hmsearch: An efficient hamming distance query processing algorithm,Xiaoyang Zhang; Jianbin Qin; Wei Wang; Yifang Sun; Jiaheng Lu,Abstract Hamming distance measures the number of dimensions where two vectors havedifferent values. In applications such as pattern recognition; information retrieval; anddatabases; we often need to efficiently process Hamming distance query; which retrievesvectors in a database that have no more than k Hamming distance from a given queryvector. Existing work on efficient Hamming distance query processing has some of thefollowing limitations; such as only applicable to tiny error threshold values; unable to dealwith vectors where the value domain is large; or unable to attain robust performance in thepresence of data skew. In this paper; we propose HmSearch; an efficient query processingmethod for Hamming distance queries that addresses the above-mentioned limitations.

Efficient algorithm for computing link-based similarity in real world networks,Yuanzhe Cai; Gao Cong; Xu Jia; Hongyan Liu; Jun He; Jiaheng Lu; Xiaoyong Du,Similarity calculation has many applications; such as information retrieval; and collaborativefiltering; among many others. It has been shown that link-based similarity measure; such asSimRank; is very effective in characterizing the object similarities in networks; such as theWeb; by exploiting the object-to-object relationship. Unfortunately; it is prohibitivelyexpensive to compute the link-based similarity in a relatively large graph. In this paper;based on the observation that link-based similarity scores of real world graphs follow thepower-law distribution; we propose a new approximate algorithm; namely Power-SimRank;with guaranteed error bound to efficiently compute link-based similarity measure.

A study of SQL-on-hadoop systems,Yueguo Chen; Xiongpai Qin; Haoqiong Bian; Jun Chen; Zhaoan Dong; Xiaoyong Du; Yanjie Gao; Dehai Liu; Jiaheng Lu; Huijie Zhang,Abstract Hadoop is now the de facto standard for storing and processing big data; not onlyfor unstructured data but also for some structured data. As a result; providing SQL analysisfunctionality to the big data resided in HDFS becomes more and more important. Hive is apioneer system that support SQL-like analysis to the data in HDFS. However; theperformance of Hive is not satisfactory for many applications. This leads to the quickemergence of dozens of SQL-on-Hadoop systems that try to support interactive SQL queryprocessing to the data stored in HDFS. This paper firstly gives a brief technical review onrecent efforts of SQL-on-Hadoop systems. Then we test and compare the performance of fiverepresentative SQL-on-Hadoop systems; based on some queries selected or derived fromthe TPC-DS benchmark.

From structure-based to semantics-based: Towards effective XML keyword search,Thuy Ngoc Le; Huayu Wu; Tok Wang Ling; Luochen Li; Jiaheng Lu,Abstract Existing XML keyword search approaches can be categorized into tree-basedsearch and graph-based search. Both of them are structure-based search because theymainly rely on the exploration of the structural features of document. Those structure-basedapproaches cannot fully exploit hidden semantics in XML document. This causes seriousproblems in processing some class of keyword queries. In this paper; we thoroughly pointout mismatches between answers returned by structure-based search and the expectationsof common users. Through detailed analysis of these mismatches; we show the importanceof semantics in XML keyword search and propose a semantics-based approach to processXML keyword queries. Particularly; we propose to use Object Relationship (OR) graph;which fully captures semantics of object; relationship and attribute; to represent XML …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2013,15
Bucket‐based authentication for outsourced databases,Jieping Wang; Xiaoyong Du; Jiaheng Lu; Wei Lu,Abstract When outsourced database owners delegate their data to service providers; whichmight be untrusted or compromised; two issues of data security emerge; including dataconfidentiality and data integrity. Most of the previous research focuses on only one issueand the solution to integrate two approaches is expensive. In this paper; we propose bucket-based authentication that can keep data confidentiality and meanwhile guarantee dataintegrity. Specifically; we first propose a new approach based on bucket checksum; whichcan be used for the authentication of multiple tuples at one time. We then apply bucketchecksum to the authentication of various types of queries in static scenarios; includingrange queries and aggregation queries; such as MIN; MAX; SUM and COUNT queries. Inthe authentication of aggregation queries; several pruning rules have been proposed to …,Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience,2010,15
Efficient algorithms for approximate member extraction using signature-based inverted lists,Jiaheng Lu; Jialong Han; Xiaofeng Meng,Abstract We study the problem of approximate membership extraction (AME); ie; how toefficiently extract substrings in a text document that approximately match some strings in agiven dictionary. This problem is important in a variety of applications such as named entityrecognition and data cleaning. We solve this problem in two steps. In the first step; for eachsubstring in the text; we filter away the strings in the dictionary that are very different from thesubstring. In the second step; each candidate string is verified to decide whether thesubstring should be extracted. We develop an incremental algorithm using signature-basedinverted lists to minimize the duplicate list-scan operations of overlapping windows in thetext. Our experimental study of the proposed algorithms on real and synthetic datasetsshowed that our solutions significantly outperform existing methods in the literature.,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,15

This paper focuses on effective keyword search in XML documents which aremodeled as labeled trees. We first analyze the problems caused by the refinement of resultgranularity during XML keyword search and then propose to partition an XML document intoXML fragments with the granularity of Minimal Information Unit (MIU). Furthermore; wepresent efficient index structures and the corresponding search algorithms. Finally; ourcomprehensive experiments demonstrate the benefits of our method over previouslyproposed methods in terms of result quality; index size and execution time.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2006,15

FlexTable: using a dynamic relation model to store RDF data,Yan Wang; Xiaoyong Du; Jiaheng Lu; Xiaofang Wang,Abstract Efficient management of RDF data is an important factor in realizing the SemanticWeb vision. The existing approaches store RDF data based on triples instead of a relationmodel. In this paper; we propose a system called FlexTable; where all triples of an instanceare coalesced into one tuple and all tuples are stored in relation schemas. The maintechnical challenge is how to partition all the triples into several tables; ie it is needed todesign an effective and dynamic schema structure to store RDF triples. To deal with thischallenge; we firstly propose a schema evolution method called LBA; which is based on alattice structure to automatically evolve schemas while new triples are inserted. Secondly;we propose a novel page layout with an interpreted storage format to reduce the physicaladjustment cost during schema evolution.

Xreal: an interactive xml keyword searching,Zhifeng Bao; Jiaheng Lu; Tok Wang Ling,Abstract Keyword search over XML data usually brings irrelevant results especially when thekeywords in a user query have ambiguities. We demonstrate a statistic-based approach toidentify the search targets and constraints of a user query in the presence of keywordambiguities; and come out a relevance oriented result ranking scheme called XML TF* IDF.Since the search intention of a same query may even vary from user to user; we provide aninteractive search strategy by allowing user to simply tick their desired search targets from alist of suggestions recommended by the search engine. In this way; we can acquire moreprecise results and also take the burden of learning the schema of XML data off users.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,11
SemanticTwig: a semantic approach to optimize XML query processing,Zhifeng Bao; Tok Wang Ling; Jiaheng Lu; Bo Chen,Abstract Twig pattern matching (TPM) is the core operation of XML query processing.Existing approaches rely on either efficient data structures or novel labeling/indexingschemes to reduce the intermediate result size; but none of them takes into account the richsemantic information resided in XML document and the query issued. Moreover; in order tofulfill the semantics of the XPath/XQuery query; most of them require costly post processingto eliminate redundant matches and group matching results. In this paper; we propose aninnovative semantics-aware query optimization approach to overcome these limitations. Inparticular; we exploit the functional dependency derived from the given semantic informationto stop query processing early; we distinguish the output and predicate nodes of a query;then propose a query breakup technique and build a query plan; such that for each …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2008,11
Object semantics for XML keyword search,Thuy Ngoc Le; Tok Wang Ling; HV Jagadish; Jiaheng Lu,Abstract It is well known that some XML elements correspond to objects (in the sense ofobject-orientation) and others do not. The question we consider in this paper is what benefitswe can derive from paying attention to such object semantics; particularly for the problem ofkeyword queries. Keyword queries against XML data have been studied extensively inrecent years; with several lowest-common-ancestor based schemes proposed for thispurpose; including SLCA; MLCA; VLCA; and ELCA. It can be seen that identifying objectscan help these techniques return more meaningful answers than just the LCA node (orsubtree) by returning objects instead of nodes. It is more interesting to see that objectsemantics can also be used to benefit the search itself. For this purpose; we introduce anovel Nearest Common Object Node semantics (NCON); which includes not just common …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2014,10

On reducing redundancy and improving efficiency of XML labeling schemes,Changqing Li; Tok Wang Ling; Jiaheng Lu; Tian Yu,Abstract The basic relationships to be determined in XML query processing are ancestor-descendant (AD); parent-child (PC); sibling and ordering relationships. The containmentlabeling scheme can determine the AD; PC and ordering relationships fast; but it is veryexpensive in determining the sibling relationship. The prefix labeling scheme can determineall the four basic relationships fast if the XML tree is shallow. However; if the XML tree isdeep; the prefix scheme is inefficient since the prefix is long. Furthermore; the prefix label isrepeated by all the siblings (only the self labels of these siblings are different). Thus in thispaper; we propose the P-Containment and P-Prefix schemes which can determine all thefour basic relationships faster no matter what the XML structure is; meanwhile P-Prefix canreduce the redundancies in the prefix labeling scheme.,Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2005,10

TJFast: Efficient processing of XML twig pattern matching,Jiaheng LU; Ting CHEN; Tok Wang LING,Finding all the occurrences of a twig pattern in an XML database is a core operation forefficient evaluation of XML queries. Previous twig join algorithms were proposed as an I/Ooptimal solution when the twig pattern only involves ancestor-descendant relationships. Inthis paper; we propose a new efficient holistic twig join algorithm; namely TJFast; which isbased on a variation of Dewey ID labeling scheme. In order to answer a twig query; TJFastonly needs to access the labels of elements whose tags appear in the leaf nodes of query.TJFast guarantees the I/O optimality for queries with only ancestor-descendant edgesconnecting branching nodes and their child nodes. In other words; unlike previousalgorithms; the optimality of TJFast allows parent-child edges to appear in some edges.Besides TJFast; we also present a novel streaming strategy; called tag+ level streaming …,*,2004,9
A moving-object index for efficient query processing with peer-wise location privacy,Dan Lin; Christian S Jensen; Rui Zhang; Lu Xiao; Jiaheng Lu,Abstract With the growing use of location-based services; location privacy attracts increasingattention from users; industry; and the research community. While considerable effort hasbeen devoted to inventing techniques that prevent service providers from knowing a user'sexact location; relatively little attention has been paid to enabling so-called peer-wiseprivacy---the protection of a user's location from unauthorized peer users. This paperidentifies an important efficiency problem in existing peer-privacy approaches that simplyapply a filtering step to identify users that are located in a query range; but that do not wantto disclose their location to the querying peer. To solve this problem; we propose a novel;privacy-policy enabled index called the PEB-tree that seamlessly integrates locationproximity and policy compatibility. We propose efficient algorithms that use the PEB-tree …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,8

Optimal and efficient generalized twig pattern processing: a combination of preorder and postorder filterings,Radim Bača; Michal Krátký; Tok Wang Ling; Jiaheng Lu,Abstract Searching for occurrences of a twig pattern query (TPQ) in an XML document is acore task of all XML database query languages. The generalized twig pattern (GTP) extendsthe TPQ model to include semantics related to output nodes; optional nodes; and booleanexpressions which are part of the XQuery language. Preorder filtering holistic algorithmssuch as TwigStack represent a significant class of TPQ processing approaches with a linearworst-case I/O complexity with respect to the sum of the input and output sizes for somequery classes. Another important class of holistic approaches is represented by postorderfiltering holistic algorithms such as Twig^ 2 Stack which introduced a linear outputenumeration time with respect to the result size.

Lotusx: a position-aware xml graphical search system with auto-completion,Chunbin Lin; Jiaheng Lu; Tok Wang Ling; Bogdan Cautis,The existing query languages for XML (eg; XQuery) require professional programming skillsto be formulated; however; such complex query languages burden the query processing. Inaddition; when issuing an XML query; users are required to be familiar with the content(including the structural and textual information) of the hierarchical XML; which is diffcult forcommon users. The need for designing user friendly interfaces to reduce the burden ofquery formulation is fundamental to the spreading of XML community. We present a twig-based XML graphical search system; called LotusX; that provides a graphical interface tosimplify the query processing without the need of learning query language and dataschemas and the knowledge of the content of the XML document.

Improving performance by creating a native join-index for OLAP,Yansong Zhang; Shan Wang; Jiaheng Lu,Abstract The performance of online analytical processing (OLAP) is critical for meeting theincreasing requirements of massive volume analytical applications. Typical techniques; suchas in-memory processing; column-storage; and join indexes focus on high performancestorage media; efficient storage models; and reduced query processing. While theyeffectively perform OLAP applications; there is a vital limitation: mainmemory databasebased OLAP (MMOLAP) cannot provide high performance for a large size data set. In thispaper; we propose a novel memory dimension table model; in which the primary keys of thedimension table can be directly mapped to dimensional tuple addresses. To achieve higherperformance of dimensional tuple access; we optimize our storage model for dimensiontables based on OLAP query workload features.

Efficient evaluation of query rewriting plan over materialized XML view,Jun Gao; Jiaheng Lu; Tengjiao Wang; Dongqing Yang,Abstract The query rewriting plan generation over XML views has received wide attentionrecently. However; little work has been done on efficient evaluation of the query rewritingplans; which is not trivial since the plan may contain an exponential size of sub-plans. Thispaper investigates the reason for the potentially exponential number of sub-plans; and thenproposes a new space-efficient form called ABCPlan (Plan with Automata BasedCombinations) to equivalently represent the original query rewriting plan. ABCPlan containsa set of buckets containing suffix paths in the query tree and an automata to indicate thecombination of the suffix paths from different buckets as valid query rewriting sub-plans. Wealso design an evaluation method called ABCScan; which constructs a unified evaluationtree for the ABCPlan and handles the evaluation tree in one scan of the XML view.

Processing XML twig pattern query with wildcards,Huayu Wu; Chunbin Lin; Tok Ling; Jiaheng Lu,Abstract In this paper; we present a novel and complementary technique to optimize XMLtwig pattern queries with wildcards (*). Our approach is based on utilizing a new axis calledAD-dis; to equivalently rewrite a query with wildcards (non-branching as well as branchingwildcards) into a single query without any wildcards. We present efficient rewritingalgorithms and also twig pattern matching algorithms to process the rewritten queries withAD-dis; which is proven to be I/O and CPU optimal. In addition; the experimental results notonly verify the scalability and efficiency of our extended matching algorithms; but alsodemonstrate the effectiveness of our rewriting algorithms.,Database and Expert Systems Applications,2012,5

Incremental Hierarchical Clustering of Stochastic Pattern-Based Symbolic Data,Xin Xu; Jiaheng Lu; Wei Wang,Abstract Classic data analysis techniques generally assume that variables have singlevalues only. However; the data complexity during the age of big data has gone beyond theclassic framework such that variable values probably take the form of a set of stochasticmeasurements instead. We refer to the above case as the stochastic pattern-based symbolicdata where each measurement set is an instance of an underlying stochastic pattern. In sucha case; non existing classic data analysis approaches; such as the crystal item or fuzzyregion ones; could apply yet. For this reason; we put forward a novel I ncremental Hierarchical C lustering algorithm for stochastic P attern-based S ymbolic D ata (IHCPSD).IHCPSD is robust to overlapping and missing measurements and well adapted forincremental learning.

An introduction to XML query processing and keyword search,Jiaheng Lu,XML is short for eXtensible Markup Language; whose purpose is to aid information systemsin sharing structured data; especially via the Internet; to encode documents; and to serializedata. The properties that XML inherited make it the widely popular standard of representingand exchanging data. When working with those XML data; there are (loosely speaking)three different functions that need to be performed: adding information to the repository;searching and retrieving information from the repository; and updating information from therepository. We focus on all three parts of functions. There are two decades since thebeginning of XML; and this field has expanded tremendously and is still expanding. Thus; nobook on XML can be comprehensive now—certainly this one is not. We just present whichwe could present clearly.,*,2013,3
New assessment criteria for query suggestion,Zhongrui Ma; Yu Chen; Ruihua Song; Tetsuya Sakai; Jiaheng Lu; Ji-Rong Wen,Abstract Query suggestion is a useful tool to help users express their information needs bysupplying alternative queries. When evaluating the effectiveness of query suggestionalgorithms; many previous studies focus on measuring whether a suggestion query isrelevant or not to the input query. This assessment criterion is too simple to describe users'requirements. In this paper; we introduce two scenarios of query suggestion. The firstscenario represents cases where the search result of the input query is unsatisfactory. Thesecond scenario represents cases where the search result is satisfactory but the user maybe looking for alternative solutions. Based on the two scenarios; we propose twoassessment criteria. Our labeling results indicate that the new assessment criteria providefiner distinctions among query suggestions than the traditional relevance-based criterion.,Proceedings of the 35th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2012,3

XML tree patternquery (TPQ) processing is a research stream within XML data management that focuses onefficient TPQ answering. With the increasing popularity of XML for data representation; thereis a lot of interest in query processing over data that conforms to a tree-structured datamodel. Queries on XML data are commonly expressed in the form of tree patterns (or twigpatterns); which represent a very useful subset of XPath and XQuery.

ICRA: Effective semantics for ranked XML keyword search,Bo Chen; Jiaheng Lu; Tok Wang Ling,Keyword search is a user-friendly way to query XML databases. Most previous efforts in thisarea focus on keyword proximity search in XML based on either tree data model or graph (ordigraph) data model. Tree data model cannot capture connections such as ID references inXML databases.

A quantal method is usedwithin the atomic orbital close-coupling approach as well as a purely classical model; ie theclassical trajectory Monte Carlo method. Both methods are in good agreement over theentire energy range for total capture cross sections and partial n= 2 cross sections. At thelevel of state-to-state differential cross sections some differences between the twoapproaches become evident. The total probability for electron transfer in both methods turnsout; however; always to be largest in left-hand side collisions where the projectile velocitycan become parallel to (match) the electron velocity of the target.,Journal of Physics B: Atomic; Molecular and Optical Physics,1998,3

In particular; given anumber of spatial objects and a set of location candidates; we select some locations whichmaximize the influence but minimize the cost. The influence of a location is defined by thenumber of spatial objects within a given distance; and the cost of a location is indicated bythe minimum payment for such location; which is measured by quality vectors. We show thata straightforward extension of a skyline approach is inefficient; as it needs to compute theinfluence and cost for all the location candidates relying on many expensive range queries.To overcome this weakness; we extend the Branch and Bound Skyline (BBS) method with …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2014,2

From Structure-based to Semantics-based Approach for Effective XML Keyword Search,Thuy Ngoc Le; Huayu Wu; Tok Wang Ling; Luochen Li; Jiaheng Lu,Existing XML keyword search approaches can be categorized into tree-based search andgraph-based search. Both of them are structure-based search because they mainly rely onthe exploration of the structural features of document. Those structure-based approachescannot fully exploit hidden semantics in XML document. This causes serious problems inprocessing some class of keyword queries. In this paper; we thoroughly point outmismatches between answers returned by structure-based search and the expectations ofcommon users. Through detailed analysis of these mismatches; we show the importance ofsemantics in XML keyword search and propose a semantics-based approach to processXML keyword queries. Particularly; we propose to use Object Relationship (OR) graph;which fully capture semantics of object; relationship and attribute; to represent XML …,*,2013,1
Ordered and Generalized XML Tree Pattern Processing,Jiaheng Lu,Abstract Although holistic twig join approach algorithm has been proven an efficient way tomatch twig pattern; it cannot deal with some special patterns efficiently such as ordered XMLtree pattern; generalized tree pattern; and extended XML tree pattern. Ordered XML twigquery means a twig query which cares the order of the matching elements. In this chapter;we propose a holistic-processing algorithm called OrderedTJ to guarantee the I/O optimality.Generalized tree pattern is modeled by XQuery statements with multiple path expressions;and we introduce GTJFast to process this kind of patterns to reduce the I/O cost. Finally;extended XML tree pattern includes not only PC/AD relationships but also negationfunctions; wildcards; and order restriction. We also show holistic algorithms to efficientlyprocess such patterns in details.,*,2013,1
Breaking out the xml mismatch trap,Yong Zeng; Zhifeng Bao; Guoliang Li; Tok Wang Ling; Jiaheng Lu,Abstract In keyword search; when user cannot get what she wants; query refinement isneeded and reason can be various. We first give a thorough categorization of the reason;then focus on solving one category of query refinement problem in the context of XMLkeyword search; where what user searches for does not exist in the data. We refer to it as theMisMatch problem in this paper. Then we propose a practical way to detect the MisMatchproblem and generate helpful suggestions to users. Our approach can be viewed as a post-processing job of query evaluation; and has three main features:(1) it adopts both thesuggested queries and their sample results as the output to user; helping user judgewhether the MisMatch problem is solved without consuming all query results;(2) it is portablein the sense that it can work with any LCA-based matching semantics and orthogonal to …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1208.2448,2012,1

Keyword search in bibliographic XML data,Bo Chen; Jiaheng Lu; Tok Wang Ling,Abstract. Keyword search is a user-friendly way to query text; HTML; XML documents andeven relational databases. The previous well-known semantic of LCA (Lowest CommonAncestor) is used for XML keyword search based on tree model. However; LCA cannotexploit the information in ID references; thus may return a large tree containing irrelevantresults. Another keyword search approach based on general digraph model of XMLcaptures ID references; but it is computationally expensive. In this paper; we first discussnew LCRA semantics based on special directed graph model that distinguishes tree edgesand reference edges in XML to overcome the problems of tree model and general digraphmodel. In particular; LCRA= LCA+ LRA+ ELRA; where LRA stands for Lowest ReferredAncestors and ELRA is Extended LRA. Then; we explore the semantics of existing …,*,2007,1

The existing solutions of auto-completion provide the suggestions based on thebeginning of the currently input character sequence (ie prefix). However; in many realapplications; one entity often has synonyms or abbreviations. For example;“DBMS” is anabbreviation of “Database Management Systems”. In this paper; we study a novel type ofauto-completion by using synonyms and abbreviations. We propose three trie-basedalgorithms to solve the top-k auto-completion with synonyms; each one with different spaceand time complexity trade-offs. Experiments on large-scale datasets show that it is possibleto support effective and efficient synonym-based retrieval of completions of a million stringswith thousands of synonyms rules at about a microsecond per-completion; while taking …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.03751,2016,*

Furthermore; a statistics-based query ranking model; which takes intoaccount of both keyword dependencies and the relevance; is proposed. The ranking modelevaluates the quality of a refined query; which captures the morphological/semanticsimilarity between the original query and refined queries and the dependency of keywordsof the refined queries over the XML data. In addition; two adaptive query refinementalgorithms are also proposed. Finally; we experimentally demonstrate the efficiency and …,*,2013,*
XML Data Indexing,Jiaheng Lu,Abstract The emergence of the Web has increased interests in XML data. XML querylanguages such as XQuery and XPath use label paths to traverse the irregularly structureddata. Without a structural summary and efficient index; query processing can be quiteinefficient due to an exhaustive traversal on XML data. To overcome the inefficiency; severalpath indexes have been proposed in the research community. DataGuides and the 1-Indexcan be viewed as covering indexes; for simple path expressions over tree-or graph-structured XML data. By representing both XML documents and XML queries in structure-encoded sequences; querying XML data is equivalent to finding subsequence matches. Wewill also introduce the above index structures in this chapter.,*,2013,*

However; these approaches commonly do not return a complete answer set for aquery because they can only find the common ancestors of a set of keywords but cannot findtheir common information appearing at their descendants in an XML document. In thispaper; we introduce a new semantics; called Nearest Common Objects Node (NCON);which guarantees that both common ancestors and common descendants are included inthe answer set for a query and therefore enables us to answer a query more completely. Wealso propose an NCON-based approach for XML keyword search; which exploits not onlythe index of the original XML document; but also the index of its reversed XML document;and devise optimization techniques to facilitate the process of finding NCONs.

Investigation on Characteristics of Internal Structure of Early-age Concrete by Non-destructive Testing,Zhonghe Shui; Sha Ding; Wei Chen; Kai Li; Jianxin Lu,Abstract Non-destructive methods such as ultrasonic wave; impact echo; and groundpenetrating radar were used to study the internal structure of early-age concrete. The resultsindicate that the ultrasonic; stress; and electromagnetic wave velocity can reflect well thevariation of the internal structure in concrete. With the influence of cement hydration; it isobvious that the three wave velocity increases and the dielectric constant decreases in thefirst 28 days. However; the changing of these characteristics tends to slow down with cementhydration. Results of compressive strength tests show that the combination of the threemethods can accurately probe changes in the internal concrete structure at early ages.

Myocardial Notch Signaling Reprograms Cardiomyoctes to a Conduction-Like Phenotype,Stacey Rentschler; Alberta Yen; Jia Lu; Nataliya Petrenko; Vickas V Patel; Glenn I Fishman; Jonathan A Epstein,Abstract Notch signaling has previously been shown to play an essential role in regulatingcell fate decisions in many systems. We hypothesized that Notch may be involved indirecting the progressive lineage restriction of cardiomyocytes into specialized conductioncells. In murine hearts where Notch signaling is activated within the myocardium from earlydevelopment onwards; Notch promotes a conduction-like phenotype as evidenced byectopic expression of conduction system-specific genes; as well as cell autonomouschanges in cellular electrophysiology. Activation of Notch in newborn ventricularcardiomyocytes from Contactin2-EGFP transgenic mice; which specifically labels conductioncells; demonstrates Notch-induced changes in “chamber” ventricular cardiomyocytesconsistent with a phenotypic switch to Purkinje-like cells; including transcriptional …,The FASEB Journal,2012,*

Using I/O-state-based dynamic value invariants; one of software visible symptoms; canprobabilistically detect peripheral hardware faults. This paper explores a software solutionthat watches for anomalous dynamic value invariant behaviors to indicate the presence ofperipheral hardware faults with low cost. The approach extracts I/O-state-based dynamicvalue invariants of real commodity software; and detects faults by checking any datainconsistencies arising in an application's behavior. We implemented the proof of concept ina full system simulator Bochs-P86. The experimentation with Windows XP shows that theapproach is effective in detecting peripheral hardware faults.

Study on Pretreatment of Saline Organic Wastewater by Ultrasound and Fenton Reagent,Jiaang Lu; Ning Xu; Jinfeng Chen; Weili Jiang; Pingfang Han; Xiaoping Lu,Abstract The Fenton method; unmodified and combined with ultrasound; was studied to treatsaline organic wastewater. The effect of pH; Fe2+; H2O2; NaCl and Na2SO4 on degradationon reactive red dyestuff was explored. The pH value and Fe2+ concentration were keyfactors during the reactions. NaCl and Na2SO4 could decrease the degradation rate ofreactive red dyestuff by the Fenton and ultrasound/Fenton method; NaCl could especiallyaffect degradation via unmodified Fenton treatment. The degradation efficiency of active reddyestuff dropped to less than 4.01% for the unmodified Fenton method in the presence of100 ppm Na2SO4. The experiment proved that the ultrasound could not only improve thedegradation efficiency of Fenton's reagent; but also weaken the negative effects of NaCl andNa2SO4.

Nowadays people use adjective" geili" more often than verb"geili" to release emotions. As an upgraded dialectal word; it can be rhetorically classified asa literary colloquial word with neutral hue. The use of" geili" in some authoritative and officialmedia indicates its renewal from an ancient form.

Huang; et al; 1991). OCT is based on lowcoherence interferometry (RC Youngquist; et al; 1987); in which the pattern of interferencebetween the reference and object beams is used to determine the amount of light reflectedback from a certain point within the volume of the sample under study. The broad bandwidthsource is used for illumination; so the two beams only produce an interference pattern whentheir optical paths difference is less than the coherence length of the source. This means thatthe bandwidth of the source determines the axial resolution of the OCT system.

AP-1 is a transcription factordownstream of different growth factor receptors (GFR) and stress-related signaling cascadesimplicated in endocrine resistance. We have previously shown that acquired endocrineresistance is associated with increased AP-1 activity. Moreover; AP-1 modulates theestrogen receptor (ER) transcriptional program; especially upon high GFR signaling. Wetherefore hypothesized that interfering with AP-1 could circumvent endocrine resistance.Methods and results AP-1 was genetically inhibited by siRNA or by stable expression of aninducible dominant-negative (DN) c-Jun in MCF7 cells.

Sensitivities of the Storm Track Position to Tropical Heating,G Chen; L Sun; J Lu,Abstract Previous studies showed that the position of jet streams/storm tracks responddifferently to global warming versus El Nino in CMIP3 models. This difference can be; atleast partially; attributed to different patterns in tropical heating. Using idealized atmosphericmodels; it is found that the direction of eddy-driven jet shift in response to tropical heating issensitive to both the structure of the mean climate and the heating; especially in the winterseason. This poses a challenge to our understanding of the storm track changes underclimate warming. This sensitivity is investigated by separately considering the Hadley cellchanges and extratropical eddy feedbacks. Tropical heating can increase both the strengthof the Hadley cell circulation and extratropical baroclinicity; which can affect the position ofthe storm tracks constructively or destructively.

Image feature extraction via local tensor rank one discriminant analysis,S-S Wu; Z-S Wei; J-F Lu; J-Y Yang,A novel supervised image feature extraction method; called local tensor rank onediscriminant analysis (LTRODA) is proposed. LTRODA learns a series of rank one tensorprojections with orthogonal constraints to produce compact features for images. To seek theoptimal projections with prominent discriminative ability; LTRODA carries out localdiscriminant analysis. LTRODA is free from the matrix singularity problem owing to its tracedifference based learning model; and a novel solving method ensures stability of thesolution. Experimental results suggest that LTRODA provides a supervised image featureextraction approach of powerful pattern-revealing capability.,Electronics letters,2011,*

We study the query answering using views problem for tree pattern queries (QAV).The QAV problem is traditionally formulated in two ways:(i) find a maximal result; or (ii) findan equivalent result. For the former; there exists an idea of searching for a maximalcontained rewriting; by applying some compensation to the result of view. Because not allthe answers will be returned; some useful answers may be missing. Motivated by this; westudy the latter one—finding an equivalent rewriting of tree pattern queries.

Androgen Regulation of 5o-Reductase Isoenzymes in Prostate Cancer: Implications for Prostate,J Li; Z Ding; Z Wang; JF Lu; SN Maity,Abstract The enzyme 5o-reductase; which converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone(DHT); performs key functions in the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway. The threeisoenzymes of 5o-reductase identified to date are encoded by different genes: SRD5A1;SRD5A2; and SRD5A3. In this study; we investigated mechanisms underlying androgenregulation of 5o-reductase isoenzyme expression in human prostate cells. We found thatandrogen regulates the mRNA level of 5oreductase isoenzymes in a cell type–specificmanner; that such regulation occurs at the transcriptional level; and that AR is necessary forthis regulation. In addition; our results suggest that AR is recruited to a negative androgenresponse element (nARE) on the promoter of SRD5A3 in vivo and directly binds to the nAREin vitro. The different expression levels of 5oreductase isoenzymes may confer response …,*,2011,*

Control of HAAs Formation Potential of Filtered Water Using Catalytic Ozonation with Supported Cerium Oxide,JF Lu; Yong Zhang; Jun Ma; Lei Ni; Yi Wang; Dong Wang; ML Qian,The influence of catalytic ozonation with supported cerium oxide (CeO2/Al2O3/O3) in acontinuous flow reactor on haloacetic acids formation potential (HAAsFP) of filtered waterwas investigated. The results indicate that CeO2/Al2O3/O3 with surface complexation of Ce(Ⅳ) as catalytic mechanism can effectively control HAAsFP in the continuous flow reactor.HAAsFP of the filtered water after catalytic ozonation is 45.3% lower than that after ozonationalone.

3.4 COMPARATIVE STUDY OF FUSION PROBABILITY BETWEEN 82Se+natCe AND 76Ge+ i5 oN d NEARTHE COULOMB BARRIER,K Nishio; H Ikezoe; S Mitsuoka; J Lu,In our previous measurement of evaporation residue cross section for 76Ge-f150Nd [1]; wefound that there is more than 13 MeV extra-extra-push energy (Exx) fr the system to fusetogether when the projectile 76Ge collides at the tip of the deformed 150Nd nucleus. On thecontrary; for the side collision having more compact configuration than the tip collision; nofusion hindrance was observed. The peculiarity of the fusion process inherent in the fusionof deformed nucleus would be clear when one compares its fusion probability with that forthe fusion reaction using spherical nuclei. So; we have measured the evaporation residuecross sectios for82Se+natCe having ZXZ2 value of 1972; which is close to 76Ge+150Nd(1920). Measurement was made by using 82Se beams supplied by the JAERI-tandembooster facility.

2.11 a DECAY OF 217Th POPULATING EXCITED STATES IN 213Ra,K Nishio; H Ikezoe; S Mitsuoka; J Lu,Experimental investigations of low-lying excited states for the N—125 isotones with evenproton numbers near the 208Pb core (207Pb; 209Po; 2u Rn and 213Ra) are interestingbecause of the simplicity of the states at low excitation. The single-particle model predictsthat the neutron-hole successively occupies the 3p|; 2/| and 3p| orbitals; dominating theconfiguration of the low-lying states. These states are populated by 7-transition followingfusion reactions and by particle stripping and/or pickup reactions. Electron capture and a-decay [1-3] of a precursor also populate these states. The a-decay to the Jn=| and| excitedstates as well as the ground state in 207Pb; 209Po and 211Rn have been investigated.

3.3 FUSION OF DEFORMED NUCLEI IN THE REACTIONS OF,K Nishio; H Ikezoe; S Mitsuoka; J Lu,The synthesis of super heavy elements (SHEs) is one of the important topics in nuclearphysics because it gives an insight into the shell stabilization in the vicinity of the doublemagic nucleus of Z= 114 and 7V= 184; without which such a heavy nucleus cannot exist dueto the overwhelming repulsive Coulomb force. Recently; an evidence of producing newSHEs was reported [1][2]. Among the Qf-decay nuclei they have observed; however; there isno nuclei whose decay properties (energy and life-time) are known. Therefore; a furtherexperimental study of synthesizing SHEs and measuring its a-decay properties is important.Production cross section of SHEs using hot-and cold-fusion reaction is extremely low; ie;pico-barn range; making an investigation of SHEs very difficult. Other approaches ofsynthesizing SHEs proposed theoretically are the gentle fusion [3] and the hugging fusion …,JAERI TANDEM ANNUAL REPORT 1999 APRIL 1; 1999-MARCH 31; 2000,2000,*

Oil aeration in the high pressure chamber of hydraulic lash adjusters in engine valve trains,Yudong ZHAO; Jiqing LU; Kun TONG,The oil bulk modulus reduction caused by aeration in the high pressure chamber ofhydraulic lash adjusters (HLA) should be taken into account to accurately model andsimulate a valve train with HLA. The bulk modulus of the oil/air mixture; and hence thevolumetric air fraction; in the HLA chamber can be determined by measuring the HLAcollapse and valve acceleration on an operating valve train; and HLA leakdown rate versusload on an HLA leakdown test rig. The method was used to determine the air content indirect acting HLA in car engines which was then used in a valve train dynamic simulation.The simulation agreed well with valve train measurements showing that the aeration can beaccurately determined and that it may be used in valve train test analysis and aeration dataaccumulation.,JOURNAL OF TSINGHUA UNIVERSITY (SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY),2000,*

A Model-based Fuzzy Ultrasound Signal Processing System for Determining Coagulation Front in Laser Irradiated Tissues,Peiyun Wu; Hao Ying; Jialiang Lu; Guanrong Chen,Abstract Tissue thermal coagulation using laser energy'is used clinically to treat tissuelesions such as cancers. To Avoid over-or undertreatment; it is necessary to know in real-time the coagulation damage front. Such a measurement technique however is unavailable.In this paper; we present a new fuzzy logic-based ultrasound signal processing techniquefor detecting the coagulation front in laser irradiated tissue. The fuzzy system that we havedeveloped determines the coagulation front based on the ultrasound measurement. Thesystem combines a theoretical model with a new fuzzy logic-enhanced recursive least-squares method. Computer simulation is conducted to compare the fuzzy system with thetraditional least-squares method; recursive least-squares method; and extended Kaimanfilter method and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the fuzzy system.

3.4 Measurement of fusion cross section for 32S+ 182W,K NISHIO; J LU; H IKEZOE; S MITSUOKA,Heavy-ion fusion cross sections at bombarding energies near the Coulomb barrier show alarge enhancement relative to the predictions of the one-dimensional barrier penetrationmodel. A coupled channel model has been widely used to explain this enhancement [1]. Wehave determined the fusion cross section for 32S+ 182W (compound nucleus 214Th); bymeasuring the fission cross section. The experimental results were compared with thecoupled channels calculation using the code CCDEF [2]. In order to measure the fissioncross section; we have developed a position sensitive AE-E ionization chamber. Thestructure of the ionization chamber is shown in Fig. l. It consists of the position sensitivedetector (PSD) and the ionization chamber; which are mounted in the stainless steelcontainer. The container has the entrance window of 2.0| im Mylar film.

3.3 SUB-BARRIER FUSION OF DEFORMED NUCLEI IN THE REACTIONS OF 60Ni+154Sm and 32S+182W,S MITSUOKA; H IKEZOE; K NISHIO; J LU,As a new approach to the superheavy-element production; the gentle fusion [1] and thehugging fusion [2] between deformed nuclei have been theoretically proposed. It ispredicted that the fusion cross section to form the compound nucleus may be significantlylarge when two well deformed nuclei take the most compact touching configuration. In orderto investigate this prediction experimentally; we have measured the fusion cross section inthe 60Ni+154Sm reaction near the Coulomb barrier; where the 154Sm target is welldeformed (/? 2= 0.32). In such reaction between the heavy ions; it is considered that theextra-push phenomenon becomes much important to the compound-nucleus formation inthe sub-barrier region. To get the direct evidence that the heavy-ion projectile really fuseswith the deformed target in the entrance channel; the fusion-evaporation residues (ER) …,JAERI TANDEM & VDG ANNUAL REPORT 1998,1999,*
3.5 Preequilibrium fission following fusion of 32S+ 182W,K NISHIO; H IKEZOE; S MITSUOKA; J LU,In recent years there has been much interest in the failure of the transition state model (TSM)of fission fragment angular distributions in sub-barrier fusion reactions involving actinidetarget. Two of the popular models that attempt to explain the anomalously high anisotropies[A= W (18O)/W (9O0)] of fission fragments are the preequilibrium AT-state model [1] and theorientation-dependent quasi-fission model [2]. In order to investigate this phenomena; wehave measured the fission fragment angular distribution for the 32S+ 182W reaction. As thecolliding nuclei are not fissile; the present reaction exclude the transfer fission; which ispeculiar to the system involving an actinide nucleus. The anisotropy for 32S+ 182W showedthe anomalous enhancement relative to the prediction of TSM below the sub-barrier energy.This work suggested that fission took places before the^-degree of freedom was …,JAERI TANDEM & VDG ANNUAL REPORT 1998,1999,*

Photoacoustic spectra of La (III); Gd (III); Tb (III) 8-hydroxyquinoline complexes and relaxation process,Q Su; Y Yang; J Lu; G Zhao,Abstract 8-hydroxyquinoline complexes of La (III) Gd (III) and Tb (III) were synthesized andthe photoacoustic (PA) spectra of these complexes were measured in the region of 300-800nm at room temperature. The PA spectra and excitation spectra are compared andinterpreted. It is observed that the photoacoustic spectra and the excitation spectra behavecomplementarily. The different fluorescence properties of the complexes and the relaxationprocess models are studied by the photoacoustic amplitude and phase spectra. It isconfirmed by the PA phase spectrum that the PA absorption of pi-pi* transition of Tb (Ox) 3complex is dominantly contributed by the slow radiationless relaxation which is due to inner-molecular energy transfer.,Guang pu xue yu guang pu fen xi= Guang pu,1998,*

Application and analysis of adjustable profile high frequency switchmode transformer using a u-shaped winding structure,J Lu; FP Dawson; S Yamada,Integrated-magnetic (IM) design techniques' have become increasingly popular with powerconversion designers over the past seventeen years. These techniques can produce asignificant reduction of the magnetic core content of related power processing systems.Recently; these IM design techniques have been extended to allow implementations inplanar forms; using modem printed circuit approaches for windings tozether with lowprofileferrite core constructions. It has been demonstrated'that all power conversion circuit designsof the switch mode variety have one or more integrated-magnetic forms; wherebytransformer and inductive components can be blended together on a single core structurewithout compromising desired conversion needs. However; in many cases; the extent ofintegration is often limited to only those magnetic components where specific timing and …,MMM-Intermag Conference; 1998. Abstracts.; The 7th Joint,1998,*
2.3 OBSERVATION OF NEW ISOMERIC STATE IN 217Pa,S MITSUOKA; T IKUTA; H IKEZOE; Y NAGAME; K TSUKADA; I NISHINAKA; J LU; T KUZUMAKI,We have performed 28Si+194Pt reaction to investigate long-lived isomeric states in the N=126 isotones of actinide nuclei by a-decay spectroscopy [1]. A 25 pnA beam of 28Si10+ fromthe JAERI-tandem accelerator was used to bombard 460~ 630/ig/cm. 2 thick 194Pt targets(95.54% enriched). The beam energies were chosen to be 163 MeV and 175 MeV in orderto maximize the yield of the 5n and 6n evaporation channels; respectively. Evaporationresidues of interest were separated from the primary beam by the JAERI recoil massseparator (JAERI-RMS)[2]. M/Q (mass/unit charge) dispersion of the JAERI-RMS was set tozero to provide large angular acceptance (20msr) and energy acceptance (±12%). Thedefinite identification of the separated recoil was achieved by the correlation analysis of itsdecay events.

3.4 OBSERVATION OF A NEW SPONTANEOUS FISSION DECAY IN THE REACTION 30Si+ 238U,H IKEZOE; T IKUTA; S MITSUOKA; Y NAGAME; I NISHINAKA; Y TSUKADA; T OHTSUKI; T KUZUMAKI; J LU,The spontaneous fission half-lives of heavy even-even nuclei decrease with increasing theatomic number Z up to 104. Recently; the heavy seaborgium isotopes 265> 266Sg havebeen synthesized in the heavy-ion fusion reactions at Dubna [1] and GSI [2]. These isotopesmainly decay by emitting a-particles. This fact indicates that the nuclear stability againstfission caused by nuclear shell structure increases significantly near the neutron number162. In order to study the decay property of the elements heavier than Z= 104; an effort wasmade to synthesize a new seaborgium isotope 264Sg in the reaction Si+ 238U. Beams of"'Siwere used to bombard a natUF4 target whose thickness was 580| ag/cm2. The target wasmounted on a wheel which was rotated with 2 cycles per second.

The exons BH of AR geneof 4 patients with complete testicular feminization (Tfm) syndromes were analyzed using acombination of PCR-SSCP and direct DNA sequencing. Two mutations in the AR genewhich caused amino acid substitutions of AR (Va1866Met; T1919→△) respectively wereidentified in two patients. No mutations in exons BH were found in the other two patients.This analysis provided valuable information for studying the molecular mechanism of Tfm.,Chinese journal of medical genetics,1996,*
Construction of cDNA library from rabbit oviduct epithelial cells with the lambdagtllSfi-Not vector,Chuanju Liu; Hong Shen; Zheng Gu; Jining Lu; Jiake Zuo,Abstract Total RNAs were isolated from the fresh rabbit oviduct epithelial cells by the one-step method of guanidine isocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction. Poly A~(+) RNAs werepurified by paramagnetic particles system of streptavidin-biotinylated-oligo (dT). The cDNAswere synthesized by reverse transcription with NotI-oligo (dT) as the primer. The cDNAsfragments larger than 300bp were ligated with lambdagtllSfi-Not vector; and then packagedwith packaging protein extracts. Titration of the packaged phage was 2.0× 10~(6) pfu/ml; theratio of recombinants to nonrecombinants was nearly 1000: 1; several recombinantsselected randomly were revealed to be cDNA fragments respectively through EcoRI-Not Idigestion; moreover; three positive clones were identified from this cDNA library usingpolyclonal antiserum to DPF-1.,Chinese biochemical journal,1996,*

The ABA Binding Proteins and Their Properties in Grapevine Fruit,Da-Peng Zhang; Zi-Lian Zhang; Jia Chen; Jiang Lu,Abstract The abscisic acid (ABA) has a key role in the regulation of grapevine fruit ripening;but the cellular and molecular biological mechanism of the hormone action in the fruitripening remains unknown. By means of differential centrifugation; microsomes wereprepared from Kyoho grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.× V. Labrusca L.) berries; and using themicrosomes; we have obtained evidence for the occurrence of specific ABA-binding sites onthe membranes with the microvolume radio-ligand binding assay. The binding sites hadsaturability; high affinity; and low capacity. The results of trypsin and dithiothreitol treatmentsto the microsomes suggested that ABA binding sites had the properties of proteins that mighthave disulfide group located at or near the binding site. The binding maximum amount ofABA in the microsomes was at pH 6.0 and the activity of ABA binding proteins was higher …,HortScience,1996,*

Comparison of three typing methods for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,CH Chen; JJ Lu; YT Liu; JH Lee; Wei-Hwa Lee; Chao-Hung Lee,Abstract Fifty-seven independent isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from bloodspecimens were typed with 3 different methods: ribotyping; random amplified polymorphicDNA (RAPD) typing; and pyocin typing. Ribotyping was performed by probing the rRNAgenes of genomic DNA that was digested separately with 4 different restriction enzymes.Digestion of DNA from 57 P. aeruginosa isolates with BamHI; ClaI; EcoRI; and PstI produced4; 4; 6; and 7 patterns; respectively. As a result; ribotyping classified the 57 isolates into 22types. Six new ribotypes that had not been described previously were found. One BamHI; 1ClaI; 2 EcoRI; and 2 PstI patterns were novel. RAPD typing was performed with two differentpolymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers (RAPD1 and RAPD2). Both primers classified the57 isolates into 15 RAPD types and produced identical patterns.

AN INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (ITS) ARCHITECTURAL MODEL FOR RURAL HIGHWAYS IN ALASKA,JJ Lu; S Yang,Technologies in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have the potential to create afundamental change in the surface transportation systems. Currently; most ITS researchstudies related to highways have focused on urban and/or suburban road systems whereheavy traffic occurs during peak-hours. However; in Alaska; because of its specialgeographic and environmental situation; the rural highway system suffers heavier traffic andcongestion caused by recreational vehicles during the summer season. During the winterseason; travelers on rural highways receive much worse service because many servicestations and rural highways are closed. To assure effective and safe operations of the ruralhighway system in Alaska; advanced technologies are needed to manage traffic andincidents; provide route choice guidance; and provide information regarding vehicle …,Intelligent Transportation: Realizing the Future.

Genotypical differences of stomatal and non-stomatal water loss traits in winter wheat,Xiuling Jia; Ruikun Ma; Shuzhen Liu; Jiali Jian; Jianli Lu,Abstract Rate of water loss (RWL) of excised-leaves transpiration rate (TR) of leaves andinitial water content (IWC) were studied in lines of yield regional tests in three years. Theresults showed that there were significant genotypical differences for all the three traits.There were relatively consistent tendencies in ranks for the above traits in spite of somefluctuations. RWL data from different yield regional tests measured on the same day couldbe satisfactorily analyzed as a whole. RWL results were consistent among years. RWL andIWC tended to follow normal distributions. There was no correlation between RWL and TR;and a weak positive correlation was observed for RWL and IWC. The three traits were notcorrelated with grain yield. Based on these results; selection of high yield as well as lowRWL and low TR for drought tolerance was discussed.,Acta Agriculturae Boreali-Sinica,1995,*

Stress hormones in trigeminal nociception,Jie Lu,The role of norepinephrine and adrenal steroids in trigeminal pain processing is the focus ofthis thesis. To determine if local release of norepinephrine within trigeminal subnucleus caudalis(Vc) influences the autonomic aspects of nociception; norepinephrine or specific adrenergicreceptor agonists were microinjected into Vc in anesthetized rats. Norepinephrine injected intolaminae I-II of Vc evoked a significant increase in adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) that was mimickedby $\alpha\sb1$-adrenoceptor (methoxamine); but not $\alpha\sb2$-(clonidine) or $\beta$-(isoproterenol) adrenergic receptor agonists. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were not affected. The resultssuggest that norepinephrine acts within the superficial laminae of Vc to alter selected autonomicresponses by an $\alpha\sb1$-adrenergic receptor mechanism … To determine the effect ofadrenal steroids in trigeminal nociception; Fos-like immunoreactivity(Fos-LI); a marker for …,*,1994,*

These studies involved the imposition of different applied voltages on the ERfluid domain and various concentrations of the suspension particles. Electro-rheologicalfluids belong to a class of colloidal suspensions whose global characteristics can becontrolled by the imposition of an appropriate external electric field upon the fluid domain.Therefore; when these fluids are embedded within a smart beam-like structure; the globalproperties of the beam; and hence its vibrational response; can also be controlled.

An approach toward mechanization of acquiring reusable software components,Zongming Fei; Jian Lu,Abstract This paper gives a method for acquiring reusable software componentsautomatically. Two categories of resources are distinguished; ie; reusable patterns andreusable building blocks. It employs explanation--based learning method to analyse theconcrete software design and generate its structural description; which; combined withsemantic constraints; constitutes the reusable patterns. In order to obtain reusable buildingblocks; it applies both deduction and induction to construct the functional description of codefragment hierarchically; which; associated with code; is truly reusable in some sense. Theability of the system is enhanced with the acquisition of these reusable components and thescope of solvable problems is enlarged by employing them.,ACM SIGPLAN Notices,1993,*

a Laboratory Simulation of Urban Heat-Island Circulation in a Stratified Environment.,Jie Jessie Lu,Abstract A three-dimensional heat-island model is established in the convection tank of theFluid Modeling Facility; US Environmental Protection Agency. Water is used as the workingfluid. The model is capable of simulating the temperature and velocity fields induced by alow-aspect-ratio heat island in a calm and stably stratified environment. The convectivecirculation is turbulent and the Froude number is found to be the controlling parameter whenReynolds-number independence holds. The differences between low-and high-aspect-ratioplumes are discussed and two analytical models; the bulk convective model and thehydrostatic model; are developed for low-aspect-ratio plumes to predict the plume heights;heat-island intensities; and velocity distributions.

Load-deflection curves for steel tubular struts associated with varying material effects,Jing Ping Lu; Lewis C Schmidt,Abstract A nonlinear finite element model for tracing the inelastic pre-and post-buckling load-deformation path of tubular struts has been developed. The analysis accountssimultaneously for both the geometrical and material nonlinearities. The influence of strain-unloading is included. In particular; the model takes into account a generalised stress-strainrelationship and the influence of strain hardening and the Bauschinger effect. The structuretangent stiffness matrix is obtained by using a series of transformation matrices to update theelement geometry. A so-called arc-length iterative numerical procedure is combined with amodified Newton-Raphson method to obtain a solution to the incremental equations ofequilibrium. The procedure has been applied to trace out the inelastic load-deflection pathsof pin-ended struts with varying slenderness ratios and initial geometrical imperfections …,Journal of Constructional Steel Research,1992,*

Multi-origin usage for chromosome replication of suppressive integration strain of dnaA46 mutant of Escherichia coli integrated with R6K,JIANWEI Lu; YUMIN Mao; ZUJIA Sheng,Abstract The chromosome of temperature sensitive initiation mutant dnaA46 of Escherichiacoli K-12 fails to replicate at 42 degrees C. Suppressive integration (Sin) strain integratedwith the R6K plasmid was screened at 42 degrees C. Marker frequency determination of theSin strain reveals that replication was initiated at the normal site of initiation at 30 degrees C;while at three different sites at 42 degrees C. Two of the sites have been reported in thestable DNA replication mutant; one of them is a novel site. Inhibition of chromosomereplication was not observed for the recA derivative of Sin initiated at two of the initiationsites close to the normal initiation site. Inhibition was observed for chromosome replicationinitiated near the site where chromosome replication normally terminates. It indicates thatchromosome replication initiated at sites close to the terminus is recA gene dependent.,Yi chuan xue bao= Acta genetica Sinica,1991,*

Percutaneous balloon exploration and plug closure of arterial duct,SG Ren; JX Lu; K Kang,Abstract Percutaneous plug closure of arterial duct (AD) was performed on 38 patients; withages ranging from 6 to 54 years. The inside diameter of AD varied from 3.7 to 11.6 mm andthe shunt size of AD was 8-77% of the pulmonary flow. A combined technique was used inthe closure operation; which employs a balloon catheter to explore the size of AD as well asits distensibility and a catheter scale to examine the compatibility of the foam plug with theAD to be closed. Total occlusion was achieved in all the 38 cases; the success rate being100%. Immediately after the procedure; blood oxygen analysis showed an interruption of theleft-to-right shunt and the pulmonary artery pressure decreased from 4.71+/-0.80 to 3.34+/-0.53 kPa (P less than 0.001). Four to 7 days later; the cardiothoracic ratio reduced from52.8+/-4.6 to 49.7+/-4.2%(P less than 0.001) and the cardiac index decreased from 6.00+ …,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,1990,*
COHERENT TRANSITION IN A HIGHLY ORIENTED YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7− δ SUPERCONDUCTING THIN FILM,HH Wen; J Fang; JH Lu; XW Cao; JZ Shi; WZ Shi; WG Yao; ZZ Qi,The I–V characteristics and critical current density at different temperatures have beencarried out with a highly (100) oriented superconducting polycrystalline film. It is found that Ic= I c (0)(1–t) 2; which is similar to that of network constructed with ideal SNS junctions. At atemperature T (kT) which is below the individual grains transition temperature T c0; acoherent transition will occur because the coupling energy between grains begins to belarger than thermal fluctuating energy. According to Halperin-Nelson theory; we estimatethat T (kT)= 81.1 K; and the behaviors of temperature dependent resistance can be wellexplained. Meanwhile; we draw a conclusion that the supercurrent density ρs (T)= ρs (0)(1−t) 2.,Modern Physics Letters B,1990,*

Immunological humoral response in mice experimentally infected with Echinococcus granulosus; preliminary result of kinetic observation,HC Xue; LS Qiu; YH Zhang; CW Zhang; ZX Zhu; YQ Yang; JA Lu; H Li,Abstract 5 serological methods included latex agglutination test (LA); enzyme-linkedimmunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB); enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); dot-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Dot-ELISA) and immunofluorescence antibody test(IFA) were used to trace the kinetic changes of the humoral response in NIH miceexperimentally infected with protoscolex of Echinococcus granulosus. Results showed thatDot-ELISA and IFA were able to detect antibodies 2 wk after infection while ELISA; EITB andLA gave positive reactions 4 wk; 2 mos and 3 mos after infection respectively. Therefore Dot-ELISA and IFA were considered to be the most sensitive ones among the 5 methods used.All infected mice gave positive reactions at 8 and 12 mos but none of the normal controlmice showed any reaction throughout the period of observation (Fig. 1).,Zhongguo ji sheng chong xue yu ji sheng chong bing za zhi= Chinese journal of parasitology & parasitic diseases,1988,*
Mg 2+-MEDIATED CHANGES IN FLUIDITY OF PHOSPHOLIPID DECREASE THE SLOW MOTION OF THE INCORPORATED H+-ATPase IN LIPOSOMES,WANG JINFENG; LU JINGFEN; ZHANG BINXIAN; YANG FUYU,The effect of Mg 2+ on the slow motion of H+-ATPase in proteoliposome was studied. TheST-ESR spectra of H+-ATPase labeled with maleimide and incorporated in liposomes atvarious Mg 2+ concentrations with incubation method were measured. The relationshipbetween the diagnostic param-eters L"/L; C'/C derived from ST-ESR spectra and Mg 2+concentrations or temperatures was com-pared with that of the order parameter S derivedfrom 5NS-ESR spectra under the same conditions. Obtain-ed results clearly showed that theincrease of Mg 2+ concentration or the decrease of temperature maycause the increase ofthe rotational correlation time of H+-ATPase in proteoliposome. And the rota-tional diffusionrate of H+-ATPase in membrane lipid is related to the activation energy of the sur-roundinglipid.

The status of exchangeable potassium; calcium; and magnesium in the major Fujian soil great groups and their distributions,JQ Lu,Seventy-seven soil samples were selected for atomic absorption spectro-photometry on theirexchangeable K; Ca and Mg levels. The data indicated that the K; Ca and Mg contents insoils are quite low; especially the red soil (OXISOL). In proportion to the total amount ofcations the percentage is K 16; Mg 20 and Ca 38 (%) respectively. The ratio of K/Ca is 0.43;and K/Mg 0.83 (me/100g soil). According to the higher level of K and lower levels of Ca andMg; it is recommended that K-fertilizer should be used and may response fairly while Ca andMg may response slightly. From the regional distribution data; it seems that K status is lowerthan that of Ca and Mg in the southern subtropical zone of this province while Ca and Mgare lower than K in the central subtropical zone.

Closure to “Development and Prediction of Bed Armoring” by Hsieh W. Shen and Jau-Yau Lu (April; 1983),Hsieh W Shen; Jau-Yau Lu,The writers wish to thank Dr. Odgaard for his interest in their paper. The discussion focuseson the possibility of fitting the grain size distributions of armor coat by a normal distribution.The hypothesis that the grain size distributions of armor coat are normal for Runs 3-1; 3-4; 1-1; 6-1 and 1/5 (as selected for discussion by Odgaard) can be accepted statistically with alevel of significance of less than 10% based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. However; itcan be seen from the discusser's Fig. 15 that the normal distribution with mean 3.0 mm andstandard deviation 1.72 cannot fit the data points very well for the small sediment sizes (lessthan 2 mm). All of the measured data points for the sediment sizes less than 2 mm fall belowthe fitted normal curve. This fact becomes even clearer when the grain size distributions ofarmor coat are plotted with a probability scale instead of a linear scale; as shown in Fig …,Journal of Hydraulic Engineering,1984,*

For spatialcrowdsourcing to scale to millions of workers and tasks; it should be able to efficiently assigntasks to workers; which in turn consists of both matching tasks to workers and computing aschedule for each worker. The two current approaches for task assignment in spatialcrowdsourcing; batched assignment and centralized online assignment; cannot scale aseither task matching or task scheduling will become a bottleneck. Instead; we propose adistributed online assignment approach utilizing an auction-based framework whereworkers bid on every arriving task and the server determines the highest bidder; resulting …,Resource,*,*

Theresults show a very large break-up and transfer cross-section corresponding to the largestfraction of the total reaction cross-section. No evidence of threshold anomaly emerged fromthe elasticscattering optical-model analysis. Recently; a great interest has been devoted tostudying the role of break-up processes of halo and weakly bound nuclei on differentmechanisms in heavy-ion reactions at energies near the Coulomb barrier; eg [1–6]. Instudying reaction mechanisms in collisions induced by halo nuclei; one of the problems tobe solved is the interplay between break-up process and fusion process. In fact; due to thelarger radius and; as a consequence; the lower barrier; one expects a larger fusion cross …,*,*,*

It wasfound that the fusion probability depends on the orientation of the deformed targets. Whenthe projectiles collide at the tip of the deformed nuclei; the fusion probability is considerablyreduced to the amount of 1/100-1/1000 of the predictions. On the other hand; when theprojectiles collide at the side of the deformed nuclei; the fusion occurs without anyhindrance. This phenomenon was understood qualitatively by comparing the distancebetween mass centers of two colliding nuclei at the touching configuration with the positionof the saddle point of the compound nucleus. When the distance is longer than the saddleposition; the fusion is hindered and an extra-extra push energy is needed to evolve into …,*,*,*

Growth of Free-standing Non-polar GaN on LiAlO 2 Substrates by Hydride Vapor Phase Epitaxy,Mitch MC Chou; Chenlong Chen; Jin Wei Lu; Chu-An Li,[摘要]: Free-standing single crystalline gallium nitride (GaN) film was grown on LiAlO2substrate by Hydride Vapor Phase Epitaxy (HVPE); HVPE is most effective method offabricating a GaN substrate owing to its fast GaN growth rate. In our laboratory; LiAlO2 singlecrystal grown by Czochralski (Cz) method. Fortunately; we have developed 2-inch (100)oriented LiAlO2 wafer. After the growth; GaN was separated from LiAlO2 substrate andbecame free-standing. By X-ray diffraction pattern and SEM image; we found that GaN hadgreater part m-plane (10-10) and less c-plane (0001) orientations. Optical propertiesexamined by room temperature photoluminescence spectra exhibit showed a strong UVemission peak at around 363 nm and a negligible yellow band emission.

3.2. 3 Sub-barrier fusion of deformed nuclei in the reactions of 60-64Ni+ 154Sm,S Mitsuoka; H Ikezoe; K Nishio; K Satou; J Lu,Toward the" island of stability" at or near the predicted double magic nucleus 298114; greatefforts have been made to synthesize the superheavy elements by using the hot-fusionreaction with actinide targets and the cold-fusion reaction with lead-based targets of shellclosed spherical nuclei. Very recently; the syntheses of good candidate for the heaviestelements of 114; 116 and 118 by these reactions have been reported. These types of thefusion reaction have been promising to produce such superheavy elements but theproduction cross sections are the order of 1 pb or less; which may be close to the limit ofpresent day experimental techniques. As a new approach to the superheavy region; thegentle fusion and the hugging fusion between well-deformed nuclei have been theoreticallyproposed.

Funding Liquidity and Market Quality: Evidence from the S&P 500 ETF and Index Futures,Wei-Peng Chen; Shu Ling Lin; Jun Lu; Chih-Chiang Wu,ABSTRACT This paper aims to analyze the market quality in the period of credit crunch in2007 by examining the impact of funding liquidity on market liquidity and price discovery ofS&P 500 ETF (SPDRs) and index futures (E-minis). Empirical results reveal that fundingilliquidity affects market liquidity and there is a significant effect of liquidity spillover betweenSPDRs and E-minis during the subprime crisis period. Specially; the impact of fundingilliquidity on market liquidity is offset by spillover effects between the two markets in theperiod of credit crunch. In addition; SPDRs appear to significantly lead the E-mini futures inthe price-discovery process; reflecting the importance of the SPDR in the price-discoveryprocess in the S&P 500 index market. E-minis with leverage characteristic still play animportant role in the price-discovery process during the high volatility period. Considering …,*,*,*

Correlation studies for D-glutamate and Parkinson's disease mice,Chengwei Liu; Jie Lu; Xin Lu; Wenling Ma; Yiling Cai,Abstract To explore the toxicity of the D-glutamate D-Glu on glutamatergic neurons and itscorrelation to the progress of Parkinson's disease PD through the change of D-Glu in themidbrain of mice with PD. Adult C57BL male mice were randomly divided into the controlgroup and PD model group. The PD model was established by intraperitoneal injectionswith MPTP. The change of D-Glu in midbrain was detected by using highperformance liquidchromatography method. The Glu-neurons in the Substantia Nigra and Nu. of caudate-putamen were observed by using immunohistochemical method. After injection with theMPTP; Glu-neurons were reduced gradually; but D-Glu in the midbrain was increasedsignificantly compared with that in the control group. D-Glu might have the same toxicity onGlu-neurons as L-Glu in the progress of PD.,*,*,*
Syndication Loans and Banks’ Risk-Taking Behaviour,Shu Ling Lin; Jun Lu,This paper shows that borrowers' bank-dependent behavior leads lending banks to changecredit risk-taking through its lending activity. Unique data composed of 34;082 syndicatedloan of publicity banks facilities from the US for the period 1987-2010 that capture the effectof the 2008 financial crisis; to test the theory of informational monopolies advantage and thetheory of sacrificing reputational capital; analyzes the impact of capital level on bankingcredit risk-taking under syndication loans. The results show that there is positive correlationbetween the ratios of bank's capital over its total assets and banks' credit risk-taking. Itimplies that banks with lower capital level charge higher lending spread for borrowers withfewer cash flows; hence the banks would bear a lower probability of default.,*,*,*

Perturbation Method for Acoustic Multipole Logging in Transversely Isotropic Medium,Yongchun Gao; Xingang Guo; Jianwei Lu,Abstract A new and effective analytical perturbation method is presented for the multipoleacoustic logging in a transversely isotropic medium (TIM) whose symmetric principal axis isparallel to the borehole axis although the exact solutions could be found. In this paper; thenew perturbation method is adopted to simulate the full-waveforms in a boreholesurrounded by a TIM for the first time. The TIM is regarded as a reference unperturbedisotropic state added to the perturbations; and three perturbation quantities about modulideviated from the isotropic medium are introduced. By selecting a group of displacementpotentials and a cylindrical coordinate system oriented along the borehole axis; the zero-;first-order and second-order perturbation solutions of the multipole acoustic field are derivedfor the weak transversely isotropic elastic solid which has its symmetric principal axis …,*,*,*

A total of 186 pieces of 38× 89× 3658mm commercial Spruce-Pine–Fir(SPF) dimension lumber from North American was divided into three matched groups usingthe modulus of elasticity (MOE) obtained from the bending tests according to ASTM D4761.The matched groups were then tested with a transverse vibration device developed inForintek to measure the dynamic MOE; followed with tests to obtain the bending MOE andMOR; the tensile strength according to ASTM D4761 and the compressive strengthaccording to ASTM D198; respectively. It was found that the correlation coefficients (R2)were 0.766 between the dynamic MOE and the bending MOE and 0.651 between the …,*,*,*
Published Papers,Pengli Xue; Xiaofeng Sun; Yun Song; Yanjun Cheng; Dezhi Sun,ABSTRACT It is generally believed that a major cause of motor dysfunction is the impairmentin neural network that controls movement. But little is known about the underlyingmechanisms of the impairment in cortical control or in the neural connections betweencortex and muscle that lead to the loss of motor ability. So understanding the functionalconnection between motor cortex and effector muscle is of utmost importance. Previousstudy mostly relied on cross-correlation; coherence functions or model based approachessuch as Granger causality or dynamic causal modeling. In this work the information transferindex (ITI) was introduced to describe the information flows between motor cortex andmuscle. Based on the information entropy the ITI can detect both linear and nonlinearinteraction between two signals and thus represent a very comprehensive way to define …,*,*,*

Kinetic Alfvén Turbulence and Parallel Electric Fields in Flare Loops View all abstracts by submitter,JS Zhao; DJ Wu; JY Lu,This study investigates the spectral structure of the kinetic Alfvén turbulence in the low-betaplasmas. We consider a strong turbulence resulting from collisions betweencounterpropagating wavepackets with equal energy. Our results show that (1) the spectra ofthe magnetic and electric field fluctuations display a transition at the electron inertial lengthscale;(2) the turbulence cascades mainly toward the magnetic field direction as the cascadescale is smaller than the electron inertial length; and (3) the parallel electric field increasesas the turbulent scale decreases. We also show that the parallel electric field in the solarflare loops can be 10 2-10 4 times the Dreicer field as the turbulence reaches the electroninertial length scale.,*,*,*

Using deviation degree measures; the FFLP problem istransformed into a crisp δ-parametric linear programming (LP) problem. Giving the value ofdeviation degree in each constraint; the δ-fuzzy optimal solution of the FFLP problem can beobtained by solving this LP problem. An algorithm is also proposed to find a balance-fuzzyoptimal solution between two goals in conflict: to improve the values of the objective functionand to decrease the values of the deviation degrees. A numerical example is solved toillustrate the proposed method.,*,*,*

A Survey of Agent-Based Active Defense Network Model,Jun LU; Jia-lin JIAO; Zhi-min LI,Abstract: The traditional network defense technology can't adapt to the complicated;diversified and intellectualized modern network attack. As a kind of emerging technologywhich resistances network attack; the active defense technology has not merely overcomethe traditional defense technology's flaw; but also manifested the very strong superiority.Putting forward an active way of network defense model with active-detecting and active-warning based on Agent technology. With this model we can not only detect known threat;but also detect inner threat from the network and unknown threat. So agent-based defensenetwork model makes the network safer.,*,*,*

Epsilon Aminocaproic Acid Reduces Blood Transfusion after Pediatric Cardiac Operations,Jun Lu; Haoyu Meng; Ying Sun; Shukun Fu; Li-Ming Zhang; Quan Li,Introduction: Clinical trials suggested that antifibrinolytic agents such as aprotinin (AP);tranexamic acid (TA) or epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) reduced perioperativetransfusion of blood products. Minimizing blood transfusion in pediatric cardiac surgicalpatients is especially important because this group tended to require multiple stagedoperations over several years and multiple blood transfusions may increase risk of morbidityand mortality. AP had been withdrawn from clinic use due to its severe adverse effects andlower safety in cardiac surgery. TA and EACA are currently considered as two antifibrinolyticagents in reducing transfusion rates. Although there are ample of evidence (B gradeevidence) that showed TA was effective in bleeding control for pediatric cardiac surgicalpatients; there are lacking of systemic analysis for EACA in this aspect. The purpose of …,*,*,*

Issue Date:-Appears in Collections: Journal Paper,Jianhong Liu,Coping is defined as the cognitive and behavioural effort an individual makes to contendwith events appraised as stressful (Lazarus & Folkman; 1984). Coping strategies are usuallycategorized into problem-or emotion-focused (Lazarus & Folkman; 1984). Problem-focusedcoping strategies represent the active attempts people make to reduce the stress they face;whereas emotion-focused coping strategies direct at regulating emotional problems andemotionally escaping from or avoiding stressful situations. Kinicki and Latack (1990)identified a five-factor model of coping in the unemployment context; including proactivesearch (ie; job search activities); nonwork organization; positive self-assessment; distancingfrom loss (ie; distancing from unemployment in our study); and job devaluation.

GSK3beta has a unique role in regulating the efficiency of synaptic transmission in the CNS.,S Peineau; C Taghibiglou; C Bradley; TP Wong; L Liu; J Lu; E Lo; E Saule; T Bouschet; P Matthews; ZA Bortolotto; JT Isaac; YT Wang; GL Collingridge,Text Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) has been implicated in major neurologicaldisorders but its role in normal neuronal function is largely unknown. Here we show thatselective inhibitors of GSK3 completely block the induction of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)receptor-dependent long-term depression (LTD) of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated synaptic transmission; one of the majorforms of synaptic plasticity in the brain. We also demonstrate a physiological role for theinhibition of GSK3; since the transient synaptic activation of NMDA receptors completelyprevents the induction of LTD for up to one hour via a process involving activation of thephosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-GSK3beta pathway. Therefore; we can concludethat this transduction pathway provides a novel mechanism to preserve NMDA receptor …,*,*,*

In the present study; anebuliser driven by oxygen lines found in the hospital was developed to deliver aerosolisedporcine pulmonary surfactant (PPS). We hypothesised that aerosolised surfactant inhaledthrough spontaneous breathing may effectively reduce severe lung injury. METHODS: Ratswere intravenously injected with oleic acid (OA) to induce ALI and 30 minutes later theywere divided into five groups: model (injury only); PPS aerosol (PPS-aer); saline aerosol(saline-aer); PPS instillation (PPS-inst); and saline instillation (Saline-Inst). Blood gases;lung histology; and protein and TNF-alpha concentrations in the bronchoalveolar lavagefluid (BALF) were examined. RESULTS: The PPS aerosol particles were less than 2.0 …,Detail:,*,*

Space-Constrained Gram-Based Indexing for Efficient Approximate String Search (Technical Report),Alexander Behm; Shengyue Ji; Chen Li; Jiaheng Lu,Abstract—Answering approximate queries on string collec-tions is important in applicationssuch as data cleaning; query relaxation; and spell checking; where inconsistencies anderrors exist in user queries as well as data. Many existing algorithms use gram-basedinverted-list indexing structures to answer approximate string queries. These indexingstructures are “notoriously” large compared to the size of their original string collection. Inthis paper; we study how to reduce the size of such an indexing structure to a given amountof space; while retaining efficient query processing. We first study how to adopt existinginverted-list compression techniques to solve our problem. Then; we propose two novelapproaches for achieving the goal: one is based on discarding gram lists; and one is basedon combining correlated lists. They are both orthogonal to existing compression …,*,*,*
