Duplicate record detection: A survey,Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Panagiotis G Ipeirotis; Vassilios S Verykios,Often; in the real world; entities have two or more representations in databases. Duplicaterecords do not share a common key and/or they contain errors that make duplicate matchinga difficult task. Errors are introduced as the result of transcription errors; incompleteinformation; lack of standard formats; or any combination of these factors. In this paper; wepresent a thorough analysis of the literature on duplicate record detection. We coversimilarity metrics that are commonly used to detect similar field entries; and we present anextensive set of duplicate detection algorithms that can detect approximately duplicaterecords in a database. We also cover multiple techniques for improving the efficiency andscalability of approximate duplicate detection algorithms. We conclude with coverage ofexisting tools and with a brief discussion of the big open problems in the area,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2007,1806

Disclosure limitation of sensitive rules,Mike Atallah; Elisa Bertino; Ahmed Elmagarmid; Mohamed Ibrahim; Vassilios Verykios,Data products (macrodata or tabular data and micro-data or raw data records); are designedto inform public or business policy; and research or public information. Securing theseproducts against unauthorized accesses has been a long-term goal of the database securityresearch community and the government statistical agencies. Solutions to this problemrequire combining several techniques and mechanisms. Recent advances in data miningand machine learning algorithms have; however; increased the security risks one may incurwhen releasing data for mining from outside parties. Issues related to data mining andsecurity have been recognized and investigated only recently. This paper deals with theproblem of limiting disclosure of sensitive rules. In particular it is attempted to selectivelyhide some frequent itemsets from large databases with as little as possible impact on …,Knowledge and Data Engineering Exchange; 1999.(KDEX'99) Proceedings. 1999 Workshop on,1999,494
Using unknowns to prevent discovery of association rules,Yücel Saygin; Vassilios S Verykios; Chris Clifton,Abstract Data mining technology has given us new capabilities to identify correlations inlarge data sets. This introduces risks when the data is to be made public; but the correlationsare private. We introduce a method for selectively removing individual values from adatabase to prevent the discovery of a set of rules; while preserving the data for otherapplications. The efficacy and complexity of this method are discussed. We also present anexperiment showing an example of this methodology.,ACM Sigmod Record,2001,409
Hiding association rules by using confidence and support,Elena Dasseni; Vassilios S Verykios; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Elisa Bertino,Abstract Large repositories of data contain sensitive information which must be protectedagainst unauthorized access. Recent advances; in data mining and machine learningalgorithms; have increased the disclosure risks one may encounter when releasing data tooutside parties. A key problem; and still not sufficiently investigated; is the need to balancethe confidentiality of the disclosed data with the legitimate needs of the data users. Everydisclosure limitation method affects; in some way; and modifies true data values andrelationships. In this paper; we investigate confidentiality issues of a broad category of rules;which are called association rules. If the disclosure risk of some of these rules are above acertain privacy threshold; those rules must be characterized as sensitive.

TAILOR: A record linkage toolbox,Mohamed G Elfeky; Vassilios S Verykios; Ahmed K Elmagarmid,Data cleaning is a vital process that ensures the quality of data stored in real-worlddatabases. Data cleaning problems are frequently encountered in many research areas;such as knowledge discovery in databases; data warehousing; system integration and e-services. The process of identifying the record pairs that represent the same entity (duplicaterecords); commonly known as record linkage; is one of the essential elements of datacleaning. In this paper; we address the record linkage problem by adopting a machinelearning approach. Three models are proposed and are analyzed empirically. Since noexisting model; including those proposed in this paper; has been proved to be superior; wehave developed an interactive record linkage toolbox named TAILOR (backwards acronymfor" RecOrd LInkAge Toolbox"). Users of TAILOR can build their own record linkage …,Data Engineering; 2002. Proceedings. 18th International Conference on,2002,325
Privacy preserving association rule mining,Yücel Saygin; Vassilios S Verykios; Ahmed K Elmagarmid,The current trend in the application space towards systems of loosely coupled anddynamically bound components that enables just-in-time integration jeopardizes the securityof information that is shared between the broker; the requester; and the provider at runtime.In particular; new advances in data mining and knowledge discovery that allow for theextraction of hidden knowledge in an enormous amount of data; impose new threats on theseamless integration of information. We consider the problem of building privacy preservingalgorithms for one category of data mining techniques; association rule mining. Weintroduce new metrics in order to demonstrate how security issues can be taken intoconsideration in the general framework of association rule mining; and we show that thecomplexity of the new heuristics is similar to that of the original algorithms.,Research Issues in Data Engineering: Engineering E-Commerce/E-Business Systems; 2002.

A taxonomy of privacy-preserving record linkage techniques,Dinusha Vatsalan; Peter Christen; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract The process of identifying which records in two or more databases correspond tothe same entity is an important aspect of data quality activities such as data pre-processingand data integration. Known as record linkage; data matching or entity resolution; thisprocess has attracted interest from researchers in fields such as databases and datawarehousing; data mining; information systems; and machine learning. Record linkage hasvarious challenges; including scalability to large databases; accurate matching andclassification; and privacy and confidentiality. The latter challenge arises because commonlypersonal identifying data; such as names; addresses and dates of birth of individuals; areused in the linkage process. When databases are linked across organizations; the issue ofhow to protect the privacy and confidentiality of such sensitive information is crucial to …,Information Systems,2013,126
Automating the approximate record-matching process,Vassilios S Verykios; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Elias N Houstis,Abstract Data quality has many dimensions one of which is accuracy. Accuracy is usuallycompromised by errors accidentally or intensionally introduced in a database system. Theseerrors result in inconsistent; incomplete; or erroneous data elements. For example; a smallvariation in the representation of a data object; produces a unique instantiation of the objectbeing represented. In order to improve the accuracy of the data stored in a database system;we need to compare them either with real-world counterparts or with other data stored in thesame or a different system. In this paper; we address the problem of matching records whichrefer to the same entity by computing their similarity. Exact record matching has limitedapplicability in this context since even simple errors like character transpositions cannot becaptured in the record-linking process. Our methodology deploys advanced data-mining …,Information sciences,2000,117
A Bayesian decision model for cost optimal record matching,Vassilios S Verykios; George V Moustakides; Mohamed G Elfeky,Abstract In an error-free system with perfectly clean data; the construction of a global view ofthe data consists of linking-in relational terms; joining-two or more tables on their key fields.Unfortunately; most of the time; these data are neither carefully controlled for quality nornecessarily defined commonly across different data sources. As a result; the creation of sucha global data view resorts to approximate joins. In this paper; an optimal solution isproposed for the matching or the linking of database record pairs in the presence ofinconsistencies; errors or missing values in the data. Existing models for record matchingrely on decision rules that minimize the probability of error; that is the probability that asample (a measurement vector) is assigned to the wrong class. In practice though;minimizing the probability of error is not the best criterion to design a decision rule …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2003,113
An integer programming approach for frequent itemset hiding,Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract The rapid growth of transactional data brought; soon enough; into attention theneed of its further exploitation. In this paper; we investigate the problem of securing sensitiveknowledge from being exposed in patterns extracted during association rule mining. Insteadof hiding the produced rules directly; we decide to hide the sensitive frequent itemsets thatmay lead to the production of these rules. As a first step; we introduce the notion of distancebetween two databases and a measure for quantifying it. By trying to minimize the distancebetween the original database and its sanitized version (that can safely be released); wepropose a novel; exact algorithm for association rule hiding and evaluate it on real worlddatasets demonstrating its effectiveness towards solving the problem.,Proceedings of the 15th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2006,103
PYTHIA-II: a knowledge/database system for managing performance data and recommending scientific software,Elias N Houstis; Ann C Catlin; John R Rice; Vassilios S Verykios; Naren Ramakrishnan; Catherine E Houstis,Abstract Often scientists need to locate appropriate software for their problems and thenselect from among many alternatives. We have previously proposed an approach for dealingwith this task by processing performance data of the targeted software. This approach hasbeen tested using a customized implementation referred to as PYTHIA. This experiencemade us realize the complexity of the algorithmic discovery of knowledge from performancedata and of the management of these data together with the discovered knowledge.

A maxmin approach for hiding frequent itemsets,George V Moustakides; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract In this paper; we are proposing a new algorithmic approach for sanitizing raw datafrom sensitive knowledge in the context of mining of association rules. The new approach (a)relies on the maxmin criterion which is a method in decision theory for maximizing theminimum gain and (b) builds upon the border theory of frequent itemsets. Experimentalresults indicate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology both with respect to thehiding results as well as with respect to the time performance compared to similar state ofthe art approaches.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2008,89
Exact knowledge hiding through database extension,Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Vassilios S Verykios,In this paper; we propose a novel; exact border-based approach that provides an optimalsolution for the hiding of sensitive frequent itemsets by (i) minimally extending the originaldatabase by a synthetically generated database part-the database extension;(ii) formulatingthe creation of the database extension as a constraint satisfaction problem;(iii) mapping theconstraint satisfaction problem to an equivalent binary integer programming problem;(iv)exploiting underutilized synthetic transactions to proportionally increase the support of non-sensitive itemsets;(v) minimally relaxing the constraint satisfaction problem to provide anapproximate solution close to the optimal one when an ideal solution does not exist; and (vi)by using a partitioning in the universe of the items to increase the efficiency of the proposedhiding algorithm.

Providing k-anonymity in location based services,Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Panos Kalnis; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract The offering of anonymity in relational databases has attracted a great deal ofattention in the database community during the last decade [4]. Among the different solutionapproaches that have been proposed to tackle this problem; K-anonymity has receivedincreased attention and has been extensively studied in various forms. New forms of datathat come into existence; like location data capturing user movement; pave the way for theoffering of cutting edge services such as the prevailing Location Based Services (LBSs).Given that these services assume an in-depth knowledge of the mobile users' whereaboutsit is certain that the assumed knowledge may breach the privacy of the users. Thus; concreteapproaches are necessary to preserve the anonymity of the mobile users when requestingLBSs.

By focusing on the knowledge hiding thread; we present a taxonomy and a survey ofrecent approaches that have been applied to the association rule hiding problem.Association rule hiding refers to the process of modifying the original database in such away that certain sensitive association rules disappear without seriously affecting the dataand the non-sensitive rules. We also provide a thorough comparison of the presentedapproaches; and we touch upon hiding approaches used for other data mining tasks. Adetailed presentation of metrics used to evaluate the performance of those approaches isalso given. Finally; we conclude our study by enumerating interesting future directions in …,*,2008,65

Various techniques have been proposed in this context in order to extract thisinformation in the most efficient way. However efficiency is not our only concern in this study.The security and privacy issues over the extracted knowledge must be seriously consideredas well. By taking this into consideration; we study the discovery of association rules inbinary data sets and we propose algorithms for selectively hiding sensitive association rules.Association rule hiding is a well researched area in privacy preserving data mining andmany algorithms have been proposed to address it. The algorithms that we introduce use adistortion-based technique for hiding the sensitive rules.

Privacy preserving record linkage approaches,Vassilios S Verykios; Alexandros Karakasidis; Vassilios K Mitrogiannis,Privacy-preserving record linkage is a very important task; mostly because of the verysensitive nature of the personal data. The main focus in this task is to find a way to matchrecords from among different organisation data sets or databases without revealingcompetitive or personal information to non-owners. Towards accomplishing this task; severalmethods and protocols have been proposed. In this work; we propose a certainmethodology for preserving the privacy of various record linkage approaches and weimplement; examine and compare four pairs of privacy preserving record linkage methodsand protocols. Two of these protocols use n-gram based similarity comparison techniques;the third protocol uses the well known edit distance and the fourth one implements the Jaro-Winkler distance metric.

Improving data quality in practice: a case study in the italian public administration,Paolo Missier; Gail Lalk; V Verykios; F Grillo; T Lorusso; P Angeletti,Abstract Assessing and improving the quality of data stored in information systems are bothimportant and difficult tasks. For an increasing number of companies that rely on informationas one of their most important assets; enforcing high data quality levels represents astrategic investment aimed at preserving the value of those assets. For a publicadministration or a government; good data quality translates into good service and goodrelationships with the citizens. Achieving high quality standards; however; is a major taskbecause of the variety of ways that errors might be introduced in a system; and the difficultyof correcting them in a systematic way. Problems with data quality tend to fall into twocategories. The first category is related to inconsistency among systems such as format;syntax and semantic inconsistencies. The second category is related to inconsistency …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,2003,45
Privacy preserving record linkage using phonetic codes,Alexandros Karakasidis; Vassilios S Verykios,Phonetic codes such as Soundex and Metaphone havebeen used in the past to address theRecord Linkage Problem. However; to the best of our knowledge; no particulareffort wasmade within this context towards privacy assuranceduring the matching process. Phoneticcodes have aninteresting feature which can be cornerstone to providingprivacy. They aremappings of strings which do not exhibitthe one-to-one property. In this paper; we present anovel protocol for achieving privacypreserving record linkage using phonetics; weprovideproof of correctness for our approach and finally we illustrateexperimental resultsconcerning performance andmatching accuracy. The proposed protocol can be equallywellapplied to codes different than the phonetic ones; which do not exhibit the one-to-oneproperty; such as hash tables with comparable results.,Informatics; 2009.

Hiding sensitive knowledge without side effects,Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract Sensitive knowledge hiding in large transactional databases is one of the majorgoals of privacy preserving data mining. However; it is only recently that researchers wereable to identify exact solutions for the hiding of knowledge; depicted in the form of sensitivefrequent itemsets and their related association rules. Exact solutions allow for the hiding ofvulnerable knowledge without any critical compromises; such as the hiding of nonsensitivepatterns or the accidental uncovering of infrequent itemsets; amongst the frequent ones; inthe sanitized outcome. In this paper; we highlight the process of border revision; which playsa significant role towards the identification of exact hiding solutions; and we provide efficientalgorithms for the computation of the revised borders.

Secure blocking+ secure matching= secure record linkage,Alexandros Karakasidis; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract Performing approximate data matching has always been an intriguing problem forboth industry and academia. This task becomes even more challenging when therequirement of data privacy rises. In this paper; we propose a novel technique to address theproblem of efficient privacy-preserving approximate record linkage. The secure frameworkwe propose consists of two basic components. First; we utilize a secure blocking componentbased on phonetic algorithms statistically enhanced to improve security. Second; we use asecure matching component where actual approximate matching is performed using a novelprivate approach of the Levenshtein Distance algorithm. Our goal is to combine the speed ofprivate blocking with the increased accuracy of approximate secure matching.,Journal of Computing Science and Engineering,2011,37
Identifying unsafe routes for network-based trajectory privacy,Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Vassilios S Verykios; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract In this paper; we propose a privacy model that offers trajectory privacy to therequesters of Location-Based Services (LBSs); by utilizing an underlying network of usermovement. The privacy model has been implemented as a framework that (i) reconstructsthe user movement from a series of independent location updates;(ii) identifies routes whereuser privacy is at risk; and (iii) anonymizes online user requests for LBSs to protect therequester for as long as the service withstands completion. In order to achieve (iii); wepropose two anonymization techniques; the K–present (weak) and the K–frequent (strong)trajectory anonymity; and a second chance approach that takes over when anonymizationfails to ensure that the privacy of the user is preserved.

An LSH-based blocking approach with a homomorphic matching technique for privacy-preserving record linkage,Dimitrios Karapiperis; Vassilios S Verykios,We present a Λ-fold Redundant Blocking Framework; that relies on the Locality-SensitiveHashing technique for identifying candidate record pairs; which have undergone ananonymization transformation. In this context; we demonstrate the usage and evaluate theperformance of a variety of families of hash functions used for blocking. We illustrate that theperformance attained is highly correlated to the distance-preserving properties of theanonymization format used. The parameters; of the blocking scheme; are optimally selectedso that we achieve the highest possible accuracy in the least possible running time. We alsointroduce an SMC-based protocol in order to compare the formulated record pairshomomorphically; without running the risk of breaching the privacy of the underlying records.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,31
Association rule hiding methods,Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract Privacy preserving data mining has been recently introduced to cope with privacyissues related to the data subjects in the course of the mining of the data. It has also beenrecognized that it is not only the data that need to be protected but sensitive knowledgehidden in the data as well. Knowledge hiding is an emerging area of research focusing onappropriately modifying the data in such a way that sensitive knowledge escapes the miningand is not communicated to the public for privacy purposes. This article investigates thedevelopment of techniques falling under the knowledge-hiding umbrella that pertain to theassociation rule-mining task. These techniques are known as association rule hiding orfrequent pattern hiding approaches; and have been receiving a lot of attention latelybecause they touch upon important issues of handling a sort of commonly used patterns …,Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2013,29
An efficient two-party protocol for approximate matching in private record linkage,Dinusha Vatsalan; Peter Christen; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract The task of linking multiple databases with the aim to identify records that refer tothe same entity is occurring increasingly in many application areas. If unique identifiers forthe entities are not available in all the databases to be linked; techniques that calculateapproximate similarities between records must be used for the identification of matchingpairs of records. Often; the records to be linked contain personal information such as namesand addresses. In many applications; the exchange of attribute values that contain suchpersonal details between organisations is not allowed due to privacy concerns. The linkingof records between databases without revealing the actual attribute values in these recordsis the research problem known as' privacy-preserving record linkage'(PPRL).

An evaluation framework for privacy-preserving record linkage,Dinusha Vatsalan; Peter Christen; Christine M O'Keefe; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract Privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) addresses the problem of identifyingmatching records from different databases that correspond to the same real-world entitiesusing quasi-identifying attributes (in the absence of unique entity identifiers); whilepreserving privacy of these entities. Privacy is being preserved by not revealing anyinformation that could be used to infer the actual values about the records that are notreconciled to the same entity (non-matches); and any confidential or sensitive information(that is not agreed upon by the data custodians) about the records that were reconciled tothe same entity (matches) during or after the linkage process.

Record matching: Past; present and future,M Cochinwala; S Dalal; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; VS Verykios,Abstract Data quality often manifests itself as inconsistencies between systems orinconsistencies with reality. The latter can be explained as a mismatch between real worldobjects and the way they are represented in databases. The former; as it is exemplified bydata heterogeneity-semantic and structural-replicated data; and data integrity problems; isthe main cause of duplicate records. Often the same real world entity is represented by twoor more records. Many times; duplicate records do not share a common key and/or theycontain errors that makes matching them a difficult problem. This specific problem is thesubject of this expository study. This study relies on a thorough analysis of the literature; onan intimate knowledge of an application and on many years of working on data quality withsensitive telecommunication systems.

To protect the privacy of the user; the proposed methodology transforms theoriginal requests into anonymous counterparts by offering trajectory K–anonymity. As a proofof concept; we build a working prototype that implements our solution approach and is usedfor experimentation and evaluation purposes.

Efficient two-party private blocking based on sorted nearest neighborhood clustering,Dinusha Vatsalan; Peter Christen; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract Integrating data from diverse sources with the aim to identify similar records thatrefer to the same real-world entities without compromising privacy of these entities is anemerging research problem in various domains. This problem is known as privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL). Scalability of PPRL is a main challenge due to growingdata size in real-world applications. Private blocking techniques have been used in PPRL toaddress this challenge by reducing the number of record pair comparisons that need to beconducted. Many of these private blocking techniques require a trusted third party to performthe blocking. One main threat with three-party solutions is the collusion between parties toidentify the private data of another party.

Privacy protection: regulations and technologies; opportunities and threats,Dino Pedreschi; Francesco Bonchi; Franco Turini; Vassilios S Verykios; Maurizio Atzori; Bradley Malin; Bart Moelans; Yücel Saygin,Information and communication technologies (ICTs) touch many aspects of our lives. Theintegration of ICTs is enhanced by the advent of mobile; wireless; and ubiquitoustechnologies. ICTs are increasingly embedded in common services; such as mobile andwireless communication; Internet browsing; credit card e-transactions; and electronic healthrecords. As ICT-based services become ubiquitous; our everyday actions leave behindincreasingly detailed digital traces in the information systems of ICT-based serviceproviders. For example; consumers of mobile-phone technologies leave behind traces ofgeographic position to cellular provider records; Internet users leave behind traces of theWeb pages and packet requests of their computers in the access logs of domain andnetwork administrators; and credit card transactions reveal the locations and times where …,*,2008,22

A quantitative and qualitative analysis of blocking in association rule hiding,Emmanuel D Pontikakis; Yannis Theodoridis; Achilleas A Tsitsonis; Liwu Chang; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract Data mining provides the opportunity to extract useful information from largedatabases. Various techniques have been proposed in this context in order to extract thisinformation in the most efficient way. However; efficiency is not our only concern in thisstudy. The security and privacy issues over the extracted knowledge must be seriouslyconsidered as well. By taking this into consideration; we study the procedure of hidingsensitive association rules in binary data sets by blocking some data values and we presentan algorithm for solving this problem. We also provide a fuzzification of the support and theconfidence of an association rule in order to accommodate for the existence ofblocked/unknown values. In addition; we quantitatively compare the proposed algorithm withother already published algorithms by running experiments on binary data sets; and we …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM workshop on Privacy in the electronic society,2004,22

A data perturbation approach to sensitive classification rule hiding,Aggelos Delis; Vassilios S Verykios; Achilleas A Tsitsonis,Abstract This paper focuses on privacy preservation in classification rule mining. The subjectat hand is approached through the proposition of a data perturbation approach for hidingsensitive classification rules in categorical datasets. Such a methodology is absolutelynecessary in case the data needs to be published on the web so that it is amply available forpublic use as opposed to other approaches like output perturbation or cryptographictechniques that restrict the usability of the data in different ways. This methodology is basedupon the unique characteristics of sequential covering classification algorithms. It modifiesthe tuples of sensitive rules of a dataset D in such a way that these are distributed to the"more important" non-sensitive rules. In addition it assures that the tuples belonging to thesensitive rules are assigned to the non-sensitive rules in proportion to their rank in the …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2010,17
A distributed near-optimal LSH-based framework for privacy-preserving record linkage,Dimitrios Karapiperis; Vassilios S Verykios,In this paper; we present a framework which relies on the Map/Reduce paradigm in order todistribute computations among underutilized commodity hardware resources uniformly;without imposing an extra overhead on the existing infrastructure. The volume of thedistance computations; required for records comparison; is largely reduced by utilizing theso-called Locality-Sensitive Hashing technique; which is optimally tuned in order to avoidhighly redundant computations.

Advances in privacy preserving record linkage,Alexandros Karakasidis; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract However; even though many solutions have been proposed towards addressingthis problem; a new side effect rises regarding the privacy of the data which usually has tobe protected during linkage. Sensitive information such as names; addresses; and illnesses;especially in cases of medical data; should not be revealed without further evidence to anyparticipant of the merging procedure. This raises the need of creating new techniques forlinking data while; at the same time; the privacy of the subjects described by these data ispreserved. This need led to the evolvement of a new research area called privacypreserving record linkage. This chapter will attempt to present the state of the art of themethods proposed to address the privacy preserving record linkage problem and provide ataxonomy of these techniques based on their core characteristics.,*,2011,16

A generalized cost optimal decision model for record matching,Vassilios S Verykios; George V Moustakides,Abstract Record (or entity) matching or linkage is the process of identifying records in one ormore data sources; that refer to the same real world entity or object. In record linkage; theultimate goal of a decision model is to provide the decision maker with a tool for makingdecisions upon the actual matching status of a pair of records (ie; documents; events;persons; cases; etc.). Existing models of record linkage rely on decision rules that minimizethe probability of subjecting a case to clerical review; conditional on the probabilities oferroneous matches and erroneous non-matches. In practice though;(a) the value of anerroneous match is; in many applications; quite different from the value of an erroneous non-match; and (b) the cost and the probability of a misclassification; which is associated with theclerical review; is ignored in this way. In this paper; we present a decision model which is …,Proceedings of the 2004 international workshop on Information quality in information systems,2004,11

We achievehighly accurate results and simultaneously reduce significantly the computational cost byminimizing the number of distance computations performed. Our scheme providestheoretical guarantees for identifying the similar anonymized record pairs by conductingredundant blocking and by performing a distance computation only if the correspondinganonymized record pair is formulated a specified number of times. A series of experimentsillustrate the efficacy of our scheme in identifying the similar record pairs; whilesimultaneously keeping the running time exceptionally low.,Knowledge and Information Systems,2016,10
Privacy‐preserving record linkage,Vassilios S Verykios; Peter Christen,Abstract It has been recognized that sharing data between organizations can be of greatbenefit; since it can help discover novel and valuable information that is not available inindividual databases. However; as organizations are under pressure to better utilize theirlarge databases through sharing; integration; and analysis; protecting the privacy ofpersonal information in such databases is an increasingly difficult task. Record linkage is thetask of identifying and matching records that correspond to the same real-world entity inseveral databases. This task implies a crucial infrastructure component in many moderninformation systems.

Scalable blocking for privacy preserving record linkage,Alexandros Karakasidis; Georgia Koloniari; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract When dealing with sensitive and personal user data; the process of record linkageraises privacy issues. Thus; privacy preserving record linkage has emerged with the goal ofidentifying matching records across multiple data sources while preserving the privacy of theindividuals they describe. The task is very resource demanding; considering the abundanceof available data; which; in addition; are often dirty. Blocking techniques are deployed priorto matching to prune out unlikely to match candidate records so as to reduce processingtime. However; when scaling to large datasets; such methods often result in quality loss. Tothis end; we propose Multi-Sampling Transitive Closure for Encrypted Fields (MS-TCEF); anovel privacy preserving blocking technique based on the use of reference sets.

Optimal stopping: A record-linkage approach,George V Moustakides; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract Record-linkage is the process of identifying whether two separate records refer tothe same real-world entity when some elements of the record's identifying information(attributes) agree and others disagree. Existing record-linkage decision methodologies usethe outcomes from the comparisons of the whole set of attributes. Here; we propose analternative scheme that assesses the attributes sequentially; allowing for a decision to madeat any attribute's comparison stage; and thus before exhausting all available attributes. Thescheme we develop is optimum in that it minimizes a well-defined average cost criterionwhile the corresponding optimum solution can be easily mapped into a decision tree tofacilitate the record-linkage decision process.

A transversal hypergraph approach for the frequent itemset hiding problem,Elias C Stavropoulos; Vassilios S Verykios; Vasileios Kagklis,Abstract We propose a methodology for hiding all sensitive frequent itemsets in a transactiondatabase. Our methodology relies on a novel technique that enumerates the minimaltransversals of a hypergraph in order to induce the ideal border between frequent andsensitive itemsets. The ideal border is then utilized to formulate an integer linear program(ILP) that answers whether a feasible sanitized database that attains the ideal border; exists.The solution of the program identifies the set of transactions that need to be modified(sanitized) so that the hiding can be achieved with the maximum accuracy. If no solutionexists; we modify the ILP by relaxing the constraints needed to be satisfied so that thesanitized database preserves the privacy with guarantee but with minimum effect in dataquality.

Efficient Record Linkage Using a Compact Hamming Space.,Dimitrios Karapiperis; Dinusha Vatsalan; Vassilios S Verykios; Peter Christen,ABSTRACT Record linkage; the process of identifying similar records that correspond to thesame real-world entities across databases; is a well-established research problem in thedatabase; data mining; and information retrieval communities. Computing distancesbetween string values of records is the key component in order to determine the similarity ofthe represented entities. Due to the typically large volumes of records; a two-step process isfollowed. A blocking mechanism is first applied for grouping similar records together; andthen a matching mechanism is performed for comparing the records which have beeninserted into the same block. However; there does not exist any efficient blocking/matchingmechanism which provides theoretical guarantees for identifying similar records whichconsist of strings. Towards this end; we put forth the novel notion of embedding string …,EDBT,2016,4

Large-scale multi-party counting set intersection using a space efficient global synopsis,Dimitrios Karapiperis; Dinusha Vatsalan; Vassilios S Verykios; Peter Christen,Abstract Privacy-preserving set intersection (PPSI) of very large data sets is increasinglybeing required in many real application areas including health-care; national security; andlaw enforcement. Various techniques have been developed to address this problem; wherethe majority of them rely on computationally expensive cryptographic techniques. Moreover;conventional data structures cannot be used efficiently for providing count estimates of theelements of the intersection of very large data sets. We consider the problem of efficientPPSI by integrating sets from multiple (three or more) sources in order to create a globalsynopsis which is the result of the intersection of efficient data structures; known as Count-Min sketches. This global synopsis furthermore provides count estimates of the intersectedelements.

An integer linear programming scheme to sanitize sensitive frequent itemsets,Vasileios Kagklis; Vassilios S Verykios; Giannis Tzimas; Athanasios K Tsakalidis,In this paper; we propose a novel approach to address the frequent item set hiding problem;by formulating it as an integer linear program (ILP). The solution of the ILP points out thetransactions that need to be sanitized in order to achieve the hiding of the sensitive frequentitem sets; while the impact on other non-sensitive item sets is minimized. We present a novelheuristic approach to calculate the coefficients of the objective function of the ILP; while atthe same time we minimize the side effects introduced by the hiding process. We alsopropose a sanitization algorithm that performs the hiding on the selected transactions.Finally; we evaluate the proposed method on real datasets and we compare the results ofthe newly proposed method with those of other state of the art approaches.,Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI); 2014 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2014,4

Our protocolassumes no trust on a third party and/or other peers; and it is specifically suited for low-minentropy data (ie; data that can be exhaustively searched by an attacker); such as encryptedusers locations. We demonstrate that our primitive is secure and efficient: Two public-keyexponentiations are required; per each user; for each equality testing. We giveimplementation results; showing that our primitive is practical in a multiple users scenario.Finally; we describe how we could use our primitive as a building block for a proximitytesting buddy-finder service for social networks.,International Conference on Privacy in Statistical Databases,2014,4

Concealing the position of individuals in location-based services,Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract The offering of location based services requires an in-depth knowledge of thesubscriber's whereabouts. Thus; without the existence of strict safeguards; the deployment ofsuch services may easily breach user privacy. To address this issue; special algorithms arenecessary that anonymize user location information prior to its release to the serviceprovider of the telecom operator. In this paper; we extend existing work in historical K-anonymity (1) by considering an underlying network of user movement and (2) by pushingthe core functionality of the anonymizer into a spatiotemporal DBMS. The proposed schemeallows each individual to specify his/her anonymity requirements; involving a series ofspatiotemporal regions that are considered as unsafe with respect to his/her privacy.

Automating the analysis of option pricing algorithms through intelligent knowledge acquisition approaches,Vassilios S Verykios; Elias N Houstis; Lefteri H Tsoukala; Konstantinos N Pantazopoulos,The traditional approach for estimating the performance of numerical methods is to combinean operation's count with an asymptotic error analysis. This analytic approach gives ageneral feel of the comparative efficiency of methods; but it rarely leads to very preciseresults. It is now recognized that accurate performance evaluation can be made only withactual measurements on working software. Given that such an approach requires anenormous amount of performance data related to actual measurements; the development ofnovel approaches and systems that intelligently and efficiently analyze these data is of greatimportance to scientists and engineers. The paper presents intelligent knowledgeacquisition approaches and an integrated prototype system; which enables the automaticand systematic analysis of performance data.

Load-balancing the distance computations in record linkage,Dimitrios Karapiperis; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract In this paper; we propose a novel method for distributing the distance computationsof record pairs generated by a blocking mechanism to the reduce tasks of a Map/Reducesystem. The proposed solutions in the literature analyze the blocks and then construct aprofile; which contains the number of record pairs in each block. However; this deterministicprocess; including all its variants; might incur considerable overhead given massive datasets. In contrast; our method utilizes two Map/Reduce jobs where the first job formulates therecord pairs while the second job distributes these pairs to the reduce tasks; which performthe distance computations; using repetitive allocation rounds. In each such round; we utilizeall the available reduce tasks on a random basis by generating permutations of theirindexes. A series of experiments demonstrate an almost-equal distribution of the record …,ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter,2015,3
Advanced record linkage methods and privacy aspects for population reconstruction,Peter Christen; Mac Boot ANU; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract Recent times have seen an increased interest into techniques that allow the linkingof records across databases. The main challenges of record linkage are (1) scalability to theincreasingly large databases common today;(2) accurate and efficient classification ofcompared records into matches and non-matches in the presence of variations and errors inthe data; and (3) privacy issues that occur when the linking of records is based on sensitivepersonal information about individuals. The first challenge has been addressed by thedevelopment of scalable indexing techniques; the second through advanced classificationtechniques that either employ machine learning or graph based methods; and the thirdchallenge is investigated by research into privacy-preserving record linkage. In this paper;we describe these major challenges of record linkage in the context of population …,Population Reconstruction,2014,3
A data mining environment for modeling the performance of scientific software,Elias N Houstis; Vassilios S Verykios; Ann Chistine Catlin; Naren Ramakrishnan; John Rice,Abstract Complex problems; whether scientific or engineering; are most often solved todayby utilizing public domain or commercial libraries or some form of problem solvingenvironment. The task of “selecting” the best software for a targeted application orcomputation is often difficult and sometimes even intractable. We have proposed anapproach for dealing with this issue by “mining” performance data of scientific software togenerate knowledge that can be used to select software for a particular scientific problem;assuming some computational objectives. In this chapter we describe a framework togetherwith its software implementation for mining performance data of scientific software and usingthe results to generate knowledge necessary to solve the software selection problem.,*,2000,3

LSHDB: a parallel and distributed engine for record linkage and similarity search,Dimitrios Karapiperis; Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Vassilios S Verykios,In this paper; we present LSHDB; the first parallel and distributed engine for record linkageand similarity search. LSHDB materializes an abstraction layer to hide the mechanics of theLocality-Sensitive Hashing (a popular method for detecting similar items in high dimensions)which is used as the underlying similarity search engine. LSHDB creates the appropriatedata structures from the input data and persists these structures on disk using a noSQLengine. It inherently supports the parallel processing of distributed queries; is highlyextensible; and is easy to use. We will demonstrate LSHDB both as the underlying systemfor detecting similar records in the context of Record Linkage (and of Privacy-PreservingRecord Linkage) tasks; as well as a search engine for identifying string values that aresimilar to submitted queries.,Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW); 2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on,2016,2

Hiding decision tree rules by data set operations,Dimitris Kalles; Vassilios S Verykios; Athanasios Papagelis,This paper focuses on preserving the privacy of sensitive patterns in the context of inducingdecision trees. The subject at hand is approached through a record augmentation approachfor hiding sensitive classification rules in binary datasets. Such a hiding methodology ispreferred over other heuristic solutions like output perturbation or cryptographic techniques-that restrict the usability of the data in different ways-since the raw data itself is readilyavailable for public use. This methodology is based upon the unique characteristics of theinduction of binary decision trees with binary-valued symbolic attributes and binary classes.,Information; Intelligence; Systems and Applications (IISA); 2015 6th International Conference on,2015,2

Privacy in trajectory data,Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Vassilios S Verykios,AbstrAct In this era of significant advances in telecommunications and GPS sensorstechnology; a person can be tracked down to proximity of less than 5 meters. Thisremarkable progress enabled the offering of services that depend on user location (the so-called location-based services—LBSs); as well as the existence of applications that analyzemovement data for various purposes. However; without strict safeguards; both thedeployment of LBSs and the mining of movement data come at a cost of privacy for theusers; whose movement is recorded. This chapter studies privacy in both online and offlinemovement data. After introducing the reader to this field of study; we review state-of-the-artwork for location and trajectory privacy both in LBSs and in trajectory databases.

Record Matching to Improve Data Quality,Vassilios S Verykios; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; Elias N Houstis,Abstract Data Quality is defined in [TB9SJ as fitness for use; which implies that quality isrelative to the use of data. Problems with data quality tend to fall into two categories:inconsistency among systems and inconsistency with reality. Format/syntax; semantic andvalue inconsistencies are representative of inconsistency among systems whereas incorrectand missing values are representative of inconsistencies with reality. In this paper; weaddress the record matchIng problem which is related to value inconsistencies and incorrector missing values.

Distance-aware encoding of numerical values for privacy-preserving record linkage,Dimitrios Karapiperis; Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Vassilios S Verykios,In this work; we propose Bit Vectors (BV); an accurate; distance-preserving encodingscheme for representing numerical data values in privacy-preserving tasks. Although manymethods have been proposed in the literature for encoding strings; the problem of encodingnumerical values has not been effectively addressed yet. In Privacy-Preserving RecordLinkage (PPRL); a number of data custodians encode their records and submit them to atrusted third-party that is responsible to identify those records that refer to the same real-world entity. BV is supported by a strong theoretical foundation for embedding numericalvalues into an anonymization space in a way that preserves the initial distances. Keycomponents of this embedding process are (a) the employed hash functions which; byutilizing random intervals; they allow for approximate matching; and (b) the threshold that …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,1

Privacy preserving blocking and meta-blocking,Alexandros Karakasidis; Georgia Koloniari; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract Record linkage refers to integrating data from heterogeneous sources to identifyinformation regarding the same entity and provides the basis for sophisticated data mining.When privacy restrictions apply; the data sources may only have access to the mergedrecords of the linkage process; comprising the problem of privacy preserving record linkage.As data are often dirty; and there are no common unique identifiers; the linkage processrequires approximate matching and it renders to a very resource demanding task especiallyfor large volumes of data. To speed up the linkage process; privacy preserving blocking andmeta-blocking techniques are deployed. Such techniques derive groups of records that aremore likely to match with each other. In this nectar paper; we summarize our contributions toprivacy preserving blocking and meta-blocking.,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2015,1

Uncertainty for privacy and 2-dimensional range query distortion,Spyros Sioutas; Emmanouil Magkos; Ioannis Karydis; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract In this work; we study the problem of privacy-preservation data publishing in movingobjects databases. In particular; the trajectory of a mobile user in a plane is no longer apolyline in a two-dimensional space; instead it is a two-dimensional surface of fixed width2Amin; where Amin defines the semi-diameter of the minimum spatial circular extent thatmust replace the real location of the mobile user on the XY-plane; in the anonymized (kNN)request. The desired anonymity is not achieved and the entire system becomes vulnerableto attackers; since a malicious attacker can observe that during the time; many of theneighbors' ids change; except for a small number of users. Thus; we reinforce the privacymodel by clustering the mobile users according to their motion patterns in (u; θ) plane;where u and θ define the velocity measure and the motion direction (angle) respectively …,Journal of Computing Science and Engineering,2011,1
Roadmap to Future Work,Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract There is a plethora of open issues related to the problem of association rule hidingthat are still under investigation. First of all; the emergence of sophisticated exact hidingapproaches of high complexity; especially for very large databases; causes theconsideration of efficient parallel approaches to be employed for improving the runtime ofthese algorithms. Parallel approaches allow for decomposition of the constraints satisfactionproblem into numerous components that can be solved independently. The overall solutionis then attained as a function of the objectives of the individual solutions. A framework fordecomposition and parallelization of exact hiding approaches has been recently proposedin [25] and is covered in Chapter 17 of the book.

Max-Min Algorithms,Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract Moustakides & Verykios in [50; 51] propose two border based methodologies thatrely on the max–min criterion for the hiding of the sensitive itemsets. Both methodologiesuse the revised positive border of the frequent itemsets to track the impact of each tentativeitem modification that helps towards the hiding of a sensitive itemset. Then; they select toapply those item modifications to the original database that effectively conceal all thesensitive knowledge; while minimally affecting the itemsets of the revised positive borderand; consequently; the nonsensitive frequent itemsets. For each item of a sensitive itemset;the Max–Min algorithms identify the set of itemsets from the revised positive border whichdepend on it; and select among them the ones that are supported the least.

Exact knowledge hiding in transactional databases,Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Vassilios S Verykios,The hiding of sensitive knowledge in the form of frequent itemsets; has gained increasingattention over the past years.

By utilizing border revision; we unify the theory behind two exact hiding algorithmsthat guarantee optimal solutions both in terms of database distortion and side-effectsintroduced by the hiding process.

Cost Optimal Record/Entity Matching,VS Verykios; Ahmed K Elmagarmid; GV Moustakides,Abstract Record (or entity) matching or linkage is the process of identifying records in one ormore data sources; that refer to the same real world entity or object. In record linkage; theultimate goal of a decision model is to provide the decision maker with a tool for makingdecisions upon the actual matching status of a pair of records (ie; documents; events;persons; cases; etc.). Existing models of record linkage rely on decision rules that minimizethe probability of subjecting a case to clerical review; conditional on the probabilities oferroneous matches and erroneous non-matches. In practice though;(a) the value of anerroneous match is; in many applications; quite different from the value of an erroneous non-match; and (b) the cost and the probability of a misclassification; which is associated with theclerical review; is ignored in tills way. In this paper; we present a decision model which is …,*,2001,1

Reduced testing time is achieved by using pipelining in vectorapplication.

Data set operations to hide decision tree rules,Dimitris Kalles; Vassilios S Verykios; Georgios Feretzakis; Athanasios Papagelis,Abstract This paper focuses on preserving the privacy of sensitive patterns when inducingdecision trees. We adopt a record augmentation approach for hiding sensitive classificationrules in binary datasets. Such a hiding methodology is preferred over other heuristicsolutions like output perturbation or cryptographic techniques-which restrict the usability ofthe data-since the raw data itself is readily available for public use. We show some keylemmas which are related to the hiding process and we also demonstrate the methodologywith an example and an indicative experiment using a prototype hiding tool.,Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on AI for Privacy and Security,2016,*

PRIVATEER: A Private Record Linkage Toolkit.,Alexandros Karakasidis; Georgia Koloniari; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract. Privacy preserving record linkage (PPRL) is the process of integrating data acrossmultiple heterogeneous data sources without compromising their privacy. While manytechniques have been developed for PPRL; there has not been; up to now; a universallyaccepted method providing both performance and quality of results in all cases. To this end;we present PRIVATEER; a toolkit which aims at enabling practitioners to compare varioustechniques involved in the PPRL process and determine the best for their needs. The toolkitis based on a simulator; designed to be highly configurable; modular and extensible;allowing the user to test different configurations by combining a number of privacypreserving blocking and matching methods with corresponding distance and similaritymeasures on her own or sample data.

A taxonomy of privacy-preserving record link age techniques,Βασίλειος Βερύκιος; Dinusha Vatsalan; Peter Christen; Vassilios Verykios,The process of identifying which records in two or more databases correspond to the sameentity is an important aspect of data quality activities such as data pre-processing and dataintegration. Known as record linkage; data matching or entity resolution; this process hasattracted interest from researchers in fields such as databases and data warehousing; datamining; information systems; and machine learning. Record linkage has various challenges;including scalability to large databases; accurate matching and classification; and privacyand confidentiality. The latter challenge arises because commonly personal identifying data;such as names; addresses and dates of birth of individuals; are used in the linkage process.When databases are linked across organizations; the issue of how to protect the privacy andconfidentiality of such sensitive information is crucial to successful application of record …,*,2013,*

Uncertainty for anonymity and 2-dimensional range query distortion,Spyros Sioutas; Emmanouil Magkos; Ioannis Karydis; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract In this work; we study the problem of anonymity-preserving data publishing inmoving objects databases. In particular; the trajectory of a mobile user on the plane is nolonger a polyline in a two-dimensional space; instead it is a two-dimensional surface: weknow that the trajectory of the mobile user is within this surface; but we do not know exactlywhere. We transform the surface's boundary poly-lines to dual points and we focus on theinformation distortion introduced by this space translation. We develop a set of efficientspatio-temporal access methods and we experimentally measure the impact of informationdistortion by comparing the performance results of the same spatio-temporal range queriesexecuted on the original database and on the anonymized one.,International Conference on Privacy in Statistical Databases,2010,*

In this chapter; we introduce a privacy framework for LBSs that utilizes collectedmovement data to identify parts of the user trajectories; where user privacy is at an elevatedrisk. To protect the privacy of the user; the proposed methodology transforms the originalrequests into anonymous counterparts by offering trajectory K-anonymity. As a proof ofconcept; we build a working prototype that implements our solution approach and is mainlyused for experimentation and evaluation purposes. Our implementation relies on a spatialDBMS that carries out part of the necessary analysis.

Border Revision for Knowledge Hiding,Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract In this chapter; we highlight the process of border revision; which plays a significantrole on both border-based and exact approaches for association rule hiding. Simply stated;the process of border revision captures those itemsets of the original database which needto remain frequent and those that need to become infrequent in the sanitized version of thedatabase; in order to allow furnishing an optimal hiding solution. After presenting the theorybehind border revision; we introduce a set of algorithms (adopted from [27]) that can beapplied for the efficient computation of both the original and the revised borders in atransactional database; when given a minimum support threshold.,*,2010,*
Inline Algorithm,Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract In this chapter; we present in detail the first algorithm that has been proposed whichdoes not rely on any heuristics to secure the sensitive knowledge derived by associationrule mining. Similarly to Menon's algorithm (covered in Chapter 13); the inline algorithm of23 aims to hide the sensitive frequent itemsets of the original database D_O that can lead tothe production of sensitive association rules. As a first step; we will introduce the notion ofdistance between two databases along with a measure for quantifying it. The quantificationof distance provides us with important knowledge regarding the minimum data modificationthat is necessary to be induced to the original database to facilitate the hiding of thesensitive itemsets; while minimally affecting the nonsensitive ones. By trying to minimize thedistance between the original database and its sanitized counterpart; the inline algorithm …,*,2010,*
Quantifying the Privacy of Exact Hiding Algorithms,Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract The exact hiding algorithms that were presented in Chapters 14; 15; and 16 are allbased on the principle of minimum harm (distortion); which requires the minimum amount ofmodifications to be made to the original database to facilitate sensitive knowledge hiding. Asan effect; in most cases (depending on the problem instance at hand); the sensitive itemsetsare expected to be positioned just below the revised borderline in the computed sanitizeddatabase D. However; the selection of the minimum support threshold based on which thehiding is performed can lead to radically different solutions; some of which are bound to besuperior to others in terms of offered privacy. In this chapter; we present a layered approachthat was originally proposed in 27; which enables the owner of the data to quantify theprivacy that is offered on a given database by the employed exact hiding algorithm …,*,2010,*
Menon's Algorithm,Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract Menon; et al. in [47] are the first to propose a frequent itemset hiding methodologythat consists of an exact part and a heuristic part to facilitate the hiding of the sensitiveknowledge. The exact part uses the original database to formulate a Constraints SatisfactionProblem (CSP) 1 in the universe of the sensitive itemsets; with the objective of identifying theminimum number of transactions that have to be sanitized for the proper hiding of thesensitive knowledge. The optimization process of solving the CSP is driven by a criterionfunction that is inspired from the measure of accuracy [42; 60]; essentially penalizing thehiding algorithm based on the number of transactions (instead of items) that are sanitizedfrom the original database to accommodate the hiding of the sensitive itemsets. Theconstraints imposed in the integer programming formulation aim to capture the …,*,2010,*
Other Knowledge Hiding Methodologies,Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract Association rule hiding algorithms aim at protecting sensitive knowledge capturedin the form of frequent itemsets or association rules. However;(sensitive) knowledge mayappear in various forms directly related to the applied data mining algorithm that achieved toexpose it. Consequently; a set of hiding approaches have been proposed over the years toallow for the safeguarding of sensitive knowledge exposed by data mining tasks such asclustering; classification and sequence mining. In this chapter; we briefly discuss some state-of-the-art approaches for the hiding of sensitive knowledge that is depicted in any of theaforementioned formats.,*,2010,*
Distortion Schemes,Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract In this chapter; we review some popular support-based and confidence-baseddistortion algorithms that have been proposed in the association rule hiding literature.Distortion-based approaches operate by selecting specific items to include to (or excludefrom) selected transactions of the original database in order to facilitate the hiding of thesensitive association rules. Two of the most commonly employed strategies for datadistortion involve the swapping of values between transactions [10; 20]; as well as thedeletion of specific items from the database [54]. In the rest of this chapter; we present anoverview of these approaches along with other methodologies that also fit in the same class.,*,2010,*
Blocking Schemes,Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract An interesting line of research in the class of heuristic methodologies forassociation rule hiding regards approaches that block certain original values of a databaseby introducing unknowns (ie; by replacing the real values of some items in selectedtransactions of the original database with question marks “?”). Unlike data distortionschemes; blocking methodologies do not add any false information to the original databaseand thus provide a much safer alternative for critical real life applications; where thedistinction between “false” and “unknown” can be vital. Due to the introduction of unknowns;the support and the confidence of association rules that are mined from the sanitizeddatabase becomes fuzzified to an interval (rather than being an exact value) and can nolonger be safely estimated. Blocking approaches; similarly to distortion approaches; can …,*,2010,*
BBA Algorithm,Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract Sun & Yu [66; 67] in 2005 proposed the first frequent itemset hiding methodologythat relies on the notion of the border [46] of the nonsensitive frequent itemsets to track theimpact of altering transactions in the original database. By evaluating the impact of eachcandidate item modification to the itemsets of the revised positive border; the algorithmgreedily selects to apply those modifications (item deletions) that cause the least impact tothe border itemsets. As already covered in the previous chapter; the border itemsetsimplicitly dictate the status (ie; frequent vs. infrequent) of every itemset in the database.Consequently; the quality of the borders directly affects the quality of the sanitized databasethat is produced by the hiding algorithm.,*,2010,*
Parallelization Framework for Exact Hiding,Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract In this chapter; we elaborate on a novel framework; introduced in [25]; that issuitable for decomposition and parallelization of the exact hiding algorithms that werecovered in Chapters 14; 15 and 16. The framework operates in three phases to decomposeCSPs that are produced by the exact hiding algorithms; into a set of smaller CSPs that canbe solved in parallel. In the first phase; the original CSP is structurally decomposed into a setof independent CSPs; each of which is assigned to a different processor. In the secondphase; for each independent CSP a decision is made on whether it should be furtherdecomposed into a set of dependent CSPs; through a function that questions the gain of anyfurther decomposition. In the third and last step; the solutions of the various CSPs; producedas part of the decomposition process; are appropriately combined to provide the solution …,*,2010,*
Two-Phase Iterative Algorithm,Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract In this chapter; we present a two–phase iterative algorithm (proposed in 27) thatextends the functionality of the inline algorithm of 23 (Chapter 14) to allow for theidentification of exact hiding solutions for a wider spectrum of problem instances. A probleminstance is defined as the set of (i) the original dataset D_O;(ii) the minimum frequencythreshold mfreq that is considered for its mining; and (iii) the set of sensitive itemsets S thathave to be protected. Since the inline algorithm allows only supported items in D_O tobecome unsupported in D; there exist problem instances that although they allow for anexact hiding solution; the inline approach is incapable of finding it. The truthfulness of thisstatement can be observed in the experiments provided in Section 15.4; as well as in theexperimental evaluation of 26.,*,2010,*
Hybrid Algorithm,Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis; Vassilios S Verykios,Abstract Gkoulalas–Divanis & Verykios in [26] introduce the first exact methodology tostrategically perform sensitive frequent itemset hiding based on a new notion of hybriddatabase generation. This approach broadens the regular process of data sanitization (asintroduced in [10] and adopted by the overwhelming majority of researchers [10; 47; 55]) byapplying an extension to the original database instead of either modifying existingtransactions (directly or through the application of transformations); or rebuilding the datasetfrom scratch to accommodate sensitive knowledge hiding. The extended portion of thedatabase contains a set of carefully crafted transactions that achieve to lower the importanceof the sensitive patterns to a degree that they become uninteresting from the perspective ofthe data mining algorithm; while minimally affecting the importance of the nonsensitive …,*,2010,*
