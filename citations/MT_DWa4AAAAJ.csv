Towards software defined icn based edge-cloud services,Ravishankar Ravindran; Xuan Liu; Asit Chakraborti; Xinwen Zhang; Guoqiang Wang,ICN deployment will be based on the grounds of saving CAPEX/OPEX and/or enabling newservices. This paper makes a case for the latter leveraging; emerging technologies such asnetwork function virtualization (NFV) and software defined networking (SDN). We propose aframework to enable ICN based service platform as virtualized network functions to enableseveral edge-cloud services such as enterprise applications; big data analytic; or M2M/IoTservices. This platform is generic to support several ICN protocols and corresponding real-time and non-real time services leveraging ICN features such as name based routing;caching; multicasting; and flexible security techniques. As an implementation of thisarchitecture; we discuss how a scalable network based conferencing solution can berealized over the proposed ICN platform and compare it with a peer-to-peer design …,Cloud Networking (CloudNet); 2013 IEEE 2nd International Conference on,2013,33
Multipath Routing From a Traffic Engineering Perspective: How Beneficial is It?,Xuan Liu; Sudhir Mohanraj; Michał Pióro; Deep Medhi,Multipath routing gives traffic demands an opportunity to use multiple paths through anetwork. In a single-demand situation; its benefits are easy to see. In a multi-commoditycase; when potentially all node-pairs (demands) generate traffic; they compete for the samenetwork resources. In this work; we consider multipath routing in communication networks ina multi-commodity setting from a traffic engineering perspective. Based on a result fromlinear programming; we show that at an optimal solution; the number of demands that canhave multiple paths with nonzero flows is of the order of the number of network links for threecommonly used traffic engineering objectives. We introduce a multipath measure (MPM) andshow that under certain traffic conditions and topological structures; the MPM is zero or closeto zero; ie; Multipath routing provides little or limited gain compared to single-path routing …,the 22nd IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols,2014,24

An Experimental Study on Dynamic Network Reconfiguration in a Virtualized Network Environment Using Autonomic Management,Xuan Liu; Parikshit Juluri; Deep Medhi,In a virtualized network; network virtualization is achieved by creating multiple instances ofvirtual routers over existing physical routers. Critical aspects of network virtualization areresource allocation and resource re-allocation; especially in the case of router failures or re-allocation of routers due for maintenance. In this paper; we present a dynamic networkreconfiguration scheme that can provision a new virtual network and recover it from routerfailures using autonomic management. In order to provide a highly available virtual network;our approach considers replacing failed routers with the most suitable standby routers. Wehave setup an experimental virtualized network on the GpENI Virtual Network Infrastructure(GpENI-VINI) testbed in which virtual routers are geographically distributed. Our autonomicmanagement function invokes the replacement module in the event of a router failure. Our …,*,2013,14
Creating repeatable computer science and networking experiments on shared; public testbeds,Sarah Edwards; Xuan Liu; Niky Riga,Abstract There are many compelling reasons to use a shared; public testbed such as GENI;Emulab; or PlanetLab to conduct experiments in computer science and networking. Thesetestbeds support creating experiments with a large and diverse set of resources. Moreoverthese testbeds are constructed to inherently support the repeatability of experiments asrequired for scientifically sound research. Finally; the artifacts needed for a researcher torepeat their own experiment can be shared so that others can readily repeat the experimentin the same environment. However using a shared; public testbed is different fromconducting experiments on resources either owned by the experimenter or someone theexperimenter knows. Experiments on shared; public testbeds are more likely to use largetopologies; use scarce resources; and need to be tolerant to outages and maintenances …,ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review,2015,9
Constructing a virtual networking environment in a geo-distributed programmable layer-2 networking environment (G-PLaNE),Tianyi Xing; Xuan Liu; Chun-Jen Chung; Akira Wada; Shingo Ata; Dijiang Huang; Deep Medhi,With Cloud Computing technology occupying the majority of future Internet research anddevelopment work; research on deploying and extending existing capabilities onto a newlyemerging infrastructure becomes more significant. For example; extending the virtualnetwork provisioning capability onto a Geo-distributed programmable layer-2 networkingenvironment (G-PLaNE) is a novel attempt and is different from in a single domain system. Inthis paper; we aim to illustrate how to construct the virtual networking environment upon ourself-designed resource provisioning system consisting of multiple clusters through G-PLaNE.

Performance impacts due to number portability under various routing schemes,Xuan Liu; Deep Medhi,Abstract Number portability provides users the capability to keep their telephone numbers asthey moves to another provider. Number portability technology involves complicatedarchitecture between different providers. From a routing perspective; and in order to simplifythe model; we consider that the traversal of a call to a ported number may involve threedifferent networks: the Originating Network; the Donor Network; and the Recipient Network.In this work; we consider four routing schemes; Onward Routing (OR); Query on Release(QoR); Call Dropback/Return to Pivot (CD/RtP); and All Call Query (ACQ) for numberportability. We present preliminary results on their performances under various scenariosfrom a connection setup delay point of view when the rate of portability changes.,Proceedings of the 23rd International Teletraffic Congress,2011,5
Design of a software-defined resilient virtualized networking environment,Xuan Liu; Sarah Edwards; Niky Riga; Deep Medhi,Network virtualization enables programmability to the substrate network provider whoprovisions and manages virtual networks (VNs) for service providers. A mix of software-defined and autonomic technology improves the flexibility of network management;including dynamic reconfiguration in the virtualized networking environment (VNE). Virtualrouter (VR) s run at a logical level where software failures may be more frequent. Thus; a VRfailure is more frequent than a physical router failure on the substrate network. In this paper;we present a software-defined resilient virtualized networking environment where a VNtopology can be restored by using a preserved standby virtual router (S-VR) after a VRfailure. We illustrate a preliminary autonomic setup of a VNE on the GENI testbed.,11th International Conference on the Design of Reliable Communication Networks (DRCN),2015,3
Optimal Standby Virtual Routers Selection for Node Failures in a Virtual Network Environment,Xuan Liu; Deep Medhi,Network virtualization allows flexibility to configure virtual networks in a dynamic manner. Insuch a setting; to provide resilient services to virtual networks; we consider the situationwhere the substrate network provider wants to have standby virtual routers ready to servethe virtual networks in the event of a failure. Such a failure can affect one or more virtualrouters in multiple virtual networks. The goal of our work is to make the optimal selection ofstandby virtual routers so that virtual networks can be dynamically reconfigured back to theiroriginal topologies after a failure. We present an optimization formulation and a heuristic forthis problem. By considering a number of factors; we present numerical studies to show howthe optimal selection is affected. The results show that the proposed heuristic's performancewas close to the optimization model when there were sufficient standby virtual routers for …,10th International Conference on Network and Service Management,2014,3

Dynamic virtual network restoration with optimal standby virtual router selection,Xuan Liu; Deep Medhi,Fault-tolerance in a virtualized networking environment (VNE) requires additional efforts toprovide the survivability against failures on either virtual networks (VNs) or the underlyingsubstrate network. In this dissertation; we design a software-defined resilient VNE using ahybrid scheme of protection and restoration; where for each VN; a set of redundant virtualrouters (VRs) are reserved as shared standby virtual routers (S-VRs); and any S-VR can beactivated to replace a failed VR in the existed VN dynamically after the failure is identified.We first introduce a dynamic reconfiguration scheme (DRS) for node failures in a VNE; andthen propose a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model with dual goals tooptimally select S-VRs to restore all VNs while load balancing; and a heuristic algorithmbased on the model is also presented.

Can higher training practice dosage with treadmill slip-perturbation necessarily reduce risk of falls following overground slip?,Anna Lee; Tanvi Bhatt; Xuan Liu; Yiru Wang; Yi-Chung Pai,Abstract Background Perturbation training is an emerging paradigm to reduce idiopathicfalls (without clinical signs or symptoms) in older adults. While higher training threat dosage(intensity) in motor learning often directly relates to greater adaptation; retention; andgeneralization; little is known whether increasing the practice dosage (repetition) of treadmillslip-perturbation training would necessarily improve its outcomes. Research question Canhigher practice dosage of treadmill slip-perturbation training lead to greater generalization toan overground slip immediately after the training? Methods Forty-five community-dwellingolder adults (73.5±5.6 years old) participated in the present study. They were convenientlyassigned to three groups with equivalent treadmill walking duration: treadmill slip-perturbation training group with 40 practice dosage; 24 practice dosage; and zero …,Gait & posture,2018,*
The recovery response to a novel unannounced laboratory-induced slip: The “first trial effect” in older adults,Xuan Liu; Sasha Reschechtko; Shuaijie Wang; Yi-Chung Clive Pai,Abstract Background After a single slip; older adults rapidly make adaptive changes to avoidor eliminate further backward loss of balance or a fall. This rapid adaptation has beentermed the" single trial effect". The purpose of this study was to explore the relationshipbetween the motor errors subjects experienced upon a novel slip and the selection andexecution of corrective response by which they modified their ongoing gait pattern andturned it into a protective step. Methods A forward slip was induced in the laboratory among145 community-living older (≥ 65year old) adults who were protected by an overhead fullbody harness system. An eight-camera motion analysis system recorded subjects'kinematics; which was used to compute their instability (motor error); recovery stepplacement (response selection); and stability gain (motor correction).

New Results on Multipath Routing,Michal Pioro; Sudhir Mohanraj; Deep Medhi; Xuan Liu,Multipath routing of traffic demands; known also as bifurcated routing or load sharing; hasbeen studied for various telecommunication networks for a long time. An advantage ofmultipath routing is that it gives a demand the opportunity to use multiple paths through thenetwork to send its traffic. In a single-commodity situation; this benefit can be clearly seen.When multiple demands (multi-commodity situation) compete for the same resources in anetwork; we focus on the problem of how many demands can take real advantage ofmultiple paths. In this context; we present new results on multipath routing for a number ofnetwork traffic objectives. We show that under certain traffic conditions and topologicalstructures; multipath routing provides virtually no gain compared to single-path routing whenthe traffic is offered for all demand pairs in a network.
