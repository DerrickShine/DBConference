Submission of transactions from mobile workstations in a cooperative multidatabase processing environment,LH Yeo; Arkady Zaslavsky,In a multidatabase environment with mobile computers involved; the nature of computing issuch that the user may not wait for the submitted global transaction to complete beforedisconnecting from the network. In this paper; a basic architectural framework to supporttransaction management in multidatabase systems is proposed and discussed. A simplemessage and queuing facility is suggested which provides a common communication anddata exchange protocol to effectively manage global transactions submitted by mobileworkstations (MWS). The state of global transactions is modelled through the use oftransaction sub-queues. The proposed strategy allows an MWS to submit globaltransactions and then disconnect itself from the network to perform some other tasks; therebyincreasing processing parallelism and independence.,Distributed Computing Systems; 1994.; Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on,1994,104
Development and evaluation of ontology for intelligent decision support in medical emergency management for mass gatherings,Pari Delir Haghighi; Frada Burstein; Arkady Zaslavsky; Paul Arbon,Abstract Conducting a safe and successful major event highly depends on the effectiveprovision of medical emergency services that are often offered by different public and privateagencies. Poor communication and coordination between these agencies and teams canresult in delays in decision-making and duplication of efforts. Another related issue is thatemergency decisions are usually made based on individual experience and domainknowledge of relevant managerial personnel. For sustainable knowledge management andmore intelligent decision support it is beneficial to collect; consolidate; store and share theseexperiences in a form of a knowledge base or domain ontology. State-of-the-art surveysidentify this gap that there is no common ontology describing the domain knowledge forplanning and managing medical services in mass gatherings.

Cost-efficient mining techniques for data streams,Mohamed Medhat Gaber; Shonali Krishnaswamy; Arkady Zaslavsky,Abstract A data stream is a continuous and high-speed flow of data items. High speed refersto the phenomenon that the data rate is high relative to the computational power. Theincreasing focus of applications that generate and receive data streams stimulates the needfor online data stream analysis tools. Mining data streams is a real time process of extractinginteresting patterns from high-speed data streams. Mining data streams raises newproblems for the data mining community in terms of how to mine continuous high-speed dataitems that you can only have one look at. In this paper; we propose algorithm outputgranularity as a solution for mining data streams. Algorithm output granularity is the amountof mining results that fits in main memory before any incremental integration.

A survey of classification methods in data streams,Mohamed Medhat Gaber; Arkady Zaslavsky; Shonali Krishnaswamy,Abstract With the advance in both hardware and software technologies; automated datageneration and storage has become faster than ever. Such data is referred to as datastreams. Streaming data is ubiquitous today and it is often a challenging task to store;analyze and visualize such rapid large volumes of data. Most conventional data miningtechniques have to be adapted to run in a streaming environment; because of the underlyingresource constraints in terms of memory and running time. Furthermore; the data stream mayoften show concept drift; because of which adaptation of conventional algorithms becomesmore challenging. One such important conventional data mining problem is that ofclassification. In the classification problem; we attempt to model the class variable on thebasis of one or more feature variables. While this problem has been extensively studied …,*,2007,68

Context-aware QoE modelling; measurement; and prediction in mobile computing systems,Karan Mitra; Arkady Zaslavsky; Christer Åhlund,Quality of Experience (QoE) as an aggregate of Quality of Service (QoS) and human user-related metrics will be the key success factor for current and future mobile computingsystems. QoE measurement and prediction are complex tasks as they may involve a largeparameter space such as location; delay; jitter; packet loss; and user satisfaction just toname a few.

Reasoning about context in uncertain pervasive computing environments,Pari Delir Haghighi; Shonali Krishnaswamy; Arkady Zaslavsky; Mohamed Medhat Gaber,Abstract Context-awareness is a key to enabling intelligent adaptation in pervasivecomputing applications that need to cope with dynamic and uncertain environments.Addressing uncertainty is one of the major issues in context-based situation modeling andreasoning approaches. Uncertainty can be caused by inaccuracy; ambiguity orincompleteness of sensed context. However; there is another aspect of uncertainty that isassociated with human concepts and real-world situations. In this paper we propose andvalidate a Fuzzy Situation Inference (FSI) technique that is able to represent uncertainsituations and reflect delta changes of context in the situation inference results.

On-board mining of data streams in sensor networks,Mohamed Medhat Gaber; Shonali Krishnaswamy; Arkady Zaslavsky,Summary Data streams are generated in large quantities and at rapid rates from sensornetworks that typically monitor environmental conditions; traffic conditions and weatherconditions among others. A significant challenge in sensor networks is the analysis of thevast amounts of data that are rapidly generated and transmitted through sensing. Given thatwired communication is infeasible in the environmental situations outlined earlier; thecurrent method for communicating this data for analysis is through satellite channels.Satellite communication is exorbitantly expensive. In order to address this issue; we proposea strategy for on-board mining of data streams in a resource-constrained environment.

A buddy model of security for mobile agent communities operating in pervasive scenarios,John Page; Arkady Zaslavsky; Maria Indrawan,Abstract This paper examines the security aspects of different pervasive scenarios involvingagent communities evolved using multi agent systems (MAS). It describes the motivation andthe objectives behind the development of these agent communities and analyses thesecurity vulnerabilities; which arise within them. To counter these vulnerabilities; the paperproposes a Buddy model of security for the agent community. In this model; every agentprotects its neighbour within the community; thereby sharing the responsibilities of thesecurity function. This feature makes it a better option as compared to other hierarchicalmodels of security; which can be brought down by a concerted attack at the controller agent.This paper also demonstrates the applicability and the effectiveness of the Buddy model indifferent pervasive scenarios and makes a strong case for its adoption.,Proceedings of the second workshop on Australasian information security; Data Mining and Web Intelligence; and Software Internationalisation-Volume 32,2004,45

Countering security vulnerabilities using a shared security buddy model schema in mobile agent communities,John Page; Arkady Zaslavsky; Maria Indrawan,Abstract. This paper examines the security vulnerabilities faced by agent communitiesimplemented using agent and multi-agent systems. It attempts to define security from anagent as well as from an agent community perspective. To preserve the integrity and sanctityof the community model; it proposes the use of a shared-security schema. This schemadistributes the security function of the community among all valid members. The advantageof this schema is that one or more valid agent community members scrutinize the integrity ofevery agent. All agents are in turn subject to an integrity check. This chain-reaction approachhelps in mitigating the risk of malicious attacks from other agents and entities external to thecommunity.,International Workshop on Safety and Security in Multi-Agent Systems (SASEMAS 2004): 01/07/2004-02/07/2004,2004,37

Improving location accuracy by combining WLAN positioning and sensor technology,Paul Hii; Arkady Zaslavsky,ABSTRACT This paper presents a heterogeneous location-aware system that combines twotechnologies so that their properties can be aggregated to produce more accurate locationdata. This paper proposes and demonstrates a location system that uses a sensor mountedon a robot to determine its location acoustically and complement the data with location fromthe existing Ekahau Positioning Engine (EPE).

A retrieval strategy for case-based reasoning using similarity and association knowledge,Yong-Bin Kang; Shonali Krishnaswamy; Arkady Zaslavsky,Retrieval is a key phase in case-based reasoning (CBR); since it lays the foundation for theoverall effectiveness of CBR systems. Its aim is to retrieve useful cases that can be used tosolve the target problem. To perform the retrieval process; CBR systems typically exploitsimilarity knowledge and is called similarity-based retrieval (SBR). However; SBR tends torely strongly on similarity knowledge; ignoring other forms of knowledge that can be furtherleveraged to improve the retrieval performance.

Adaptability and interfaces: key to efficient pervasive computing,Arkady Zaslavsky,As mobile and embedded computing devices become more pervasive; the nature ofinteraction between users and computers is evolving. Computing applications need tobecome increasingly autonomous and invisible; by placing greater reliance on knowledge ofcontext in which they are running and reducing interactions with users. Moreover; due to thecurrent popular emphasis onanytime; anywhere'computing; applications must cope withhighly dynamic environments in which resources; such as network connectivity; bandwidth;security and software services; vary over time and therefore applications' behaviour andfunctionality have to adapt (adjust) to currently available resources and constraints.

Mobility management in heterogeneousnetwork environments needs to address the double meaning of the IP address as anendpoint identifier and a location identifier. Application-layer mobility use a non-IP endpointidentifier (eg user@ realm) while network-layer mobility uses a fixed home IP-address asendpoint identifier. The resolving of the endpoint identifier to a temporary unicast IP addressas location identifier needs support from a mobility management system.

Maintaining gateway connectivity in multi-hop ad hoc networks,Robert Brannstrom; Christer Ahlund; Arkady Zaslavsky,The need for maintaining gateway connectivity in an ad hoc access network is vitalconsidering the 80/20 ratio of Internet traffic. There are several proposals of how to integrategateway forwarding strategies but they all rely on the route discovery procedure of reactiverouting protocols. We propose a proactive approach to avoid the delay of the route discoveryprocess. Mobile IP is often suggested to handle macro mobility and we use theadvertisements periodically sent by the gateway to update routing tables in the ad hocnetwork. Since advertisements may arrive to a mobile host through multiple paths; it isimportant to keep track of the best path to each gateway. We demonstrate the use of aproposed dynamic metric and how to handle location of correspondent hosts.

Integration of ad hoc network and IP network capabilities for mobile hosts,Christer Ahlund; Arkady Zaslavsky,Mobility of user devices connecting to the Internet is of major interest in today's research innetworking. Users with portable devices; like laptops and personal digital assistants (PDA);connecting to foreign networks in the Internet want the same functionality as whenconnected to the home network; as well as accessibility through the home IP address. Adhoc networking is also of major importance for connectivity between communicating mobilehosts without a backbone infrastructure and for connectivity to access points.

Context-aware adaptive data stream mining,Pari Delir Haghighi; Arkady Zaslavsky; Shonali Krishnaswamy; Mohamed Medhat Gaber; Seng Loke,Abstract In resource-constrained devices; adaptation of data stream processing to variationsof data rates and availability of resources is crucial for consistency and continuity of runningapplications. However; to enhance and maximize the benefits of adaptation; there is a needto go beyond mere computational and device capabilities to encompass the full spectrum ofcontext-awareness. This paper presents a general approach for context-aware adaptivemining of data streams that aims to dynamically and autonomously adjust data streammining parameters according to changes in context and situations. We perform intelligentand real-time analysis of data streams generated from sensors that is under-pinned usingcontext-aware adaptation. A prototype of the proposed architecture is implemented andevaluated in the paper through a real-world scenario in the area of healthcare monitoring.,Intelligent Data Analysis,2009,20
On development and evaluation of prototype mobile decision support for hospital triage,J San Pedro; Frada Burstein; Jeff Wassertheil; N Arora; Leonid Churilov; Arkady Zaslavsky,Ambiguous triage scenarios in hospital emergency departments are often difficult to assesswithout decision support. Subjective assessments of such scenarios can either lead to under-triaging or over-triaging for which true conditions of patients are often not addressed withinthe required time. In this paper; we propose a decision support model that can guide aclinician when identifying the urgency of medical intervention when patient presents withambiguous triage case. Our model is a heuristic approach that selects the best triagecategory; identifies corresponding discriminating attribute of the patient; and allows clinicianto attach a level of confidence in the decision. We implemented this model as a mobiledecision support system; called iTriage. Results of an initial evaluation of iTriage usingfourteen paper-based adult triage scenarios showed that our model produced robust …,System Sciences; 2005. HICSS'05.

Suffix vector: A space-efficient suffix tree representation,Krisztián Monostori; Arkady Zaslavsky; István Vajk,Abstract This paper introduces a new way of representing suffix trees. The basic idea behindthe representation is that we are storing the nodes of the tree along with the string itself; thusedge labels can directly be read from the string. The new representation occupies lessspace than the best-known representation to date in case of English text and program files;though it requires slightly more space in case of DNA sequences. We also believe that ourrepresentation is clearer and thus implementing algorithms on it is easier. We also show thatour representation is not only better in terms of space but it is also faster to retrieveinformation from the tree. We theoretically compare the running time of the matchingstatistics algorithm on both representations.,International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation,2001,17

Efficiency of data structures for detecting overlaps in digital documents,Krisztián Monostori; Arkady Zaslavsky; Heinz Schmidt,This paper analyses the efficiency of different data structures for detecting overlap in digitaldocuments. Most existing approaches use some hash function to reduce the spacerequirements for their indices of chunks. Since a hash function can produce the same valuefor different chunks; false matches are possible. In this paper we propose an algorithm thatcan be used for eliminating those false matches. This algorithm uses a suffix tree structure;which is space consuming. We define a modified suffix tree that only considers chunksstarting at the beginning of words and we show how the algorithm can work on this structure.We can alternatively reduce space requirements of a suffix tree by converting it to a directedacyclic graph. We show that suffix link information can be preserved in this new structureand the matching statistics algorithm still works with those modifications that we propose.,Computer Science Conference; 2001.

These devices connect tothe Internet via network or telecommunications operators. Users usually have someexpectations about the services provided to them by different operators. Users' expectationsalong with additional factors such as cognitive and behavioural states; cost; and networkquality of service (QoS) may determine their quality of experience (QoE). If users are notsatisfied with their QoE; they may switch to different providers or may stop using a particularapplication or service. Thus; QoE measurement and prediction techniques may benefit usersin availing personalized services from service providers. On the other hand; it can helpservice providers to achieve lower user-operator switchover. This paper presents a …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1410.6952,2014,13

Context-aware adaptation; as a newdimension of research in data stream mining; enhances and optimizes distributed datastream processing tasks. Context-awareness is one of the key aspects of ubiquitouscomputing as applications' successful operations rely on detecting changes and adjustingaccordingly. This paper presents a general architecture for context-aware adaptive mining ofdata streams that aims to dynamically and autonomously adjust data stream miningparameters according to changes in context and resource availability in distributed andheterogeneous computing environments.";,Proceedings of the International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery from Ubiquitous Data Streams (IWKDUDS07),2007,12
Maintaining continuous dependability in sensor-based context-aware pervasive computing systems,Amir Padovitz; Arkady Zaslavsky; Seng Wai Loke; Bernard Burg,Sensors are often indicative of events of interest; or events which a system should be awareof and should react to. In particular; such indications may reflect unsteadiness or instabilitywith respect to the current contextual situation. This paper discusses the concepts of stabilityand instability in context-aware systems; and suggests a model; methodology and analgorithm for real-time analysis of sensor readings in order to estimate future changes incontext as well as in assisting to maintain the proper functioning of context-aware pervasivesystems. We provide a conceptual analysis of our approach; implementation details andexperimental evaluation of simulated scenarios that are part of a motivating use case.,System Sciences; 2005. HICSS'05.

A wireless data stream mining model,Mohamed Medhat Gaber; Shonali Krishnaswamy; Arkady Zaslavsky,Abstract. The sensor networks; web click stream and astronomical applications generate acontinuous flow of data streams. Most likely data streams are generated in a wirelessenvironment. These data streams challenge our ability to store and process them in real-time with limited computing capabilities of the wireless environment. Querying and miningdata streams have attracted attention in the past two years. The main idea behind theproposed techniques in mining data streams in to develop efficient approximate algorithmswith an acceptable accuracy. Recently; we have proposed algorithm output granularity as anapproach in mining data streams. This approach has the advantage of being resource-aware in addition to its generality. In this paper; a model for mining data streams in awireless environment has been proposed. The model contains two novel contributions; a …,International Workshop on Wireless Information Systems: 13/04/2004-14/04/2004,2004,12
Mission impossible? automatically assembling agents from high-level task descriptions,Glenn Jayaputera; Seng Loke; Arkady Zaslavsky,In this paper; we present our notion of automatically assembling agents on-demand givenhigh-level task descriptions. Our approach is based on the concept of the mission; which isrepresented by a hierarchical structure called the task decomposition diagram (TDD). Tasksin TDD are specified using a task specification language; which defines the functionality andpossible implementation of those tasks. We discuss several strategies for executing theTDD; for assembling agents based on the TDD; and present the architecture of our prototypesystem called eHermes.,Intelligent Agent Technology; 2003.

Cost Efficient Adaptive Protocol with Buffering for Advanced Mobile Database Applications.,Simon J Lai; Arkady B Zaslavsky; GP Martin; LH Yeo,Abstract The most recent advancements in computer hardware and communications makethe mobile computing paradigm tangible and feasible. One of the major factors affectingmobile computing is communication protocols efficiency. This paper proposes anddiscusses an Adaptive Queuing Protocol which targets advanced mobile databaseapplications. The protocol has two main objectives. Firstly; to compensate for the relativelyslow speed of some existing mobile communication links. Secondly; to reduce the cost ofcommunications by reducing link usage. In achieving these aims; our goal has been toreduce the total data volume that the link must carry; and at the same time ensure adequateresponse time for all classes of transactions. Results of computer simulation are presentedand discussed.,DASFAA,1995,12

Citywatcher: annotating and searching video data streams for smart cities applications,Alexey Medvedev; Arkady Zaslavsky; Vladimir Grudinin; Sergey Khoruzhnikov,Abstract Digital pervasive video cameras can be abundantly found everywhere these daysand their numbers grow continuously. Modern cities have large networks of surveillancecameras including CCTV; street crossings and the like. Sometimes authorities need a video-recording of some road accident (or of some other event) to understand what happened andidentify a driver who may have been at fault.

A knowledge-rich similarity measure for improving IT incident resolution process,Yong-Bin Kang; Arkady Zaslavsky; Shonali Krishnaswamy; Claudio Bartolini,Abstract The aim of incident management is to restore a given IT service disruption; simplycalled incident; to normal state as quickly as possible. In incident management; it is essentialto resolve a new incident efficiently and accurately. However; typically; incident resolutionprocess is largely manual; thus; it is time-consuming and error-prone. This paper proposes anew knowledge-rich similarity measure for improving this process. The role of this measureis to retrieve the most similar past incident cases for a new incident without humanintervention. The solution information contained the retrieved incident cases can be utilizedto resolve the new incident. The main feature of our similarity measure is to incorporateadditional useful meta knowledge; outside of incident description that is the only exploitedinformation in typical similarity measures used in CBR; to improve effectiveness …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2010,11

Meta object approach to database schema integration,J Tan; Arkady Zaslavsky; Andy Bond,Database schema integration is significant not only in building multidatabase systems butalso in data warehousing. Meta data; which define schemas; are normally involved in thesurrounding issues. And while many of these issues have been addressed in the past;unresolved issues remain. The authors present an approach that not only uses metadata butalso uses meta-meta information to make schema integration more possible. Our solutionrequires a meta object facility that serves not only as a repository but also as a more feasiblemeans of managing meta data. We also advocate the use of such a facility as part of anobject oriented middleware environment that provides an open interface standard andseveral useful services in distributed object management.,Distributed Objects and Applications; 2000.

A framework for a dynamic organizational memory information system,Henry Linger; Frada Burstein; Arkady Zaslavsky; Nick Crofts,Organizational memory information systems (OMIS) implement important aspects oforganizational memory with the aim of enhancing organizational effectiveness. We proposea 3-layered framework for a dynamic OMIS. The framework consists of a pragmatic layer tosupport the actual activity; a conceptual layer to store the concepts inherent in that activity;and a process layer to store the experience of performing that activity. Both the conceptualand process layers represent organizational memory repositories in the form of respectivemodels. The implementation of OMIS assumes that any activity is the instantiation of relevantconceptual and process models and includes the reuse of knowledge stored in associationwith those models. In this way; organizational memory is always mapped to current activity;and its adequacy is constantly evaluated.

Layered Approach to Transaction Management in Multidatabase Systems,LH Yeo; A Zaslavsky,Abstract With the proliferation of distributed computing; there arises a need for a newgeneration of database systems to support complex object manipulation and multimediaapplications while preserving interworking with existing applications. The autonomy of theseheterogeneous systems implies that the synchronisation and management of distributedtransactions have become an important issue. An architecture of a multidatabase transactionprocessing management system (MDSTPM) is suggested and discussed in this paper. Theproposed architecture provides necessary facilities and concurrency control mechanismbased on a mix of modified locking and optimistic concurrency control protocols to manageand synchronise distributed transactions across a multidatabase system.

From sensory data to situation awareness: enhanced context spaces theory approach,Andrey Boytsov; Arkady Zaslavsky,High-level context awareness can be significantly improved by the recognition of real-lifesituations. The theory of context spaces is a context awareness approach that uses spatialmetaphors to provide integrated mechanisms for both low-level and high-level contextawareness and situation awareness. Taking context spaces theory situation awareness as abaseline; we propose and analyze the enhanced situation awareness techniques; whichallow us to reason about broad class of real-life situations. We also improve reasoning aboutthe relationships between situations; and discuss how it relates to newly proposed situationawareness approaches. Practical evaluation of the results is also discussed.,Dependable; Autonomic and Secure Computing (DASC); 2011 IEEE Ninth International Conference on,2011,10

Supporting the Optimisation of Distributed Data Mining by Predicting Application Run Times.,Shonali Krishnaswamy; Seng Wai Loke; Arkady B Zaslavsky,Abstract: There is an emerging interest in optimisation strategies for distributed data miningin order to improve response time. Optimisation techniques operate by first identifying factorsthat affect the performance in distributed data mining; computing/assigning a “cost” to thosefactors for alternate scenarios or strategies and then choosing a strategy that involves theleast cost. In this paper we propose the use of application run time estimation as solution toestimating the cost of performing a data mining task in different distributed locations. A prioriknowledge of the response time provides a sound basis for optimisation strategies;particularly if there are accurate techniques to obtain such knowledge. In this paper wepresent a novel rough sets based technique for predicting the run times of applications. Wealso present experimental validation of the prediction accuracy of this technique for …,ICEIS,2002,10

The Role of Domain Ontology for Medical Emergency Management in Mass Gatherings.,Pari Delir Haghighi; Frada Burstein; Arkady B Zaslavsky; Paul Arbon; Shonali Krishnaswamy,Abstract. Mass gatherings are common events that typically attract large crowds of people. Ifsuch events are not properly planned; coordinated and managed with regard to health andsafety issues; they can become hazardous and lead to injuries; illnesses and deaths.Conducting a safe and successful mass gathering event requires effective planning andmanagement including the provision of timely medical care and response. To achieve thesegoals; there is a need for a unifying and formal model/framework of mass gatherings that canbe applied across all the emergency agencies and events; and used in support of time-critical decision making for medical emergency management in this context. However; theabsence of a common knowledge structure and conceptual model in Medical EmergencyManagement in Mass Gathering (MEMMG); acknowledged in the literature; limits our …,DSS,2010,9

There is an inherent chasm between the real-world and the world that can beperceived by computer systems; yielding uncertainty and ambiguity in system perceivedcontext; with consequent effect on the performance of context-aware systems. While theproblem is complex in depth and breadth; we explore an approach where context ischaracterized at different levels of abstraction; and where contextual information at high-levels of abstraction and sensed context at low-levels of abstraction can be used to validateand correct low-level sensed context such as location. We describe a randomly generatedsimulation of locations that might be sensed by a positioning technology; and how ourapproach can be used to validate and correct the sensed locations.,International Workshop on Ubiquitous Computing: 13/04/2004-14/04/2004,2004,9

In this paper a complex activityrecognition system (SEMACT) is proposed; built and validated. Different activities performedby users form an activity hierarchy. We perform semantic reasoning by using ontologicalconstructs and rules to recognize both concurrent and interleaved complex activities atdifferent levels of granularity of this activity hierarchy. Different application domains requireactivity recognition systems to define and recognize activities at different levels ofgranularity. Our system tackles this problem by recognizing complex activities which arethen shared across application domains using a generic API. A test-bed and prototype arebuilt to validate our SEMACT system.

Application run time estimation: a quality of service metric for web-based data mining services,Shonali Krishnaswamy; Seng Wai Loke; Arkady Zaslavsky,Abstract The emergence of Application Service Providers (ASP) hosting Internet-based datamining services is being seen as a viable alternative for organisations that value theirknowledge resources but are constrained by the high cost of data mining software.Response time is an important Quality of Service (QoS) metric for web-based data miningservice providers. The ability to estimate the response time of data mining algorithms aprioribenefits both clients and service providers. The advantage for the clients is that it helps toimpose QoS constraints on the service level agreements and the benefit for the service-providers is that it facilitates optimising resource utilisation and scheduling. In this paper wepresent a novel rough sets based technique for identifying similarity templates to estimateapplication run times. We also present experimental results and analysis of this technique.,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2002,8
Federated data mining services and a supporting XML-based language,Shonali Krishnaswamy; Arkady Zaslavsky; Seng Wai Loke,E-businesses are increasingly looking towards data mining systems for meeting theirbusiness intelligence needs. However; the current state of the art in data mining does notallow any one system to be able to meet the diverse business intelligence needs of e-businesses. A second bottleneck is the high initial cost involved in establishing data mininginfrastructure within an organisation. We propose the concept of a federated data miningsystem hosted by an Application Service Provider (ASP) as a means of alleviating thebottlenecks of high cost and diverse data mining needs. We also present an XML DTD;which provides the basis for data mining systems to describe their services and architectureto the rest of the federation.,System Sciences; 2001.

Automating directory services for mobile agent tracking,Peter Stanski; Dean Thompson; Mqhele Nzama; Arkady Zaslavsky; Noel Craske,Since the introduction of a number of distributed computing environments; there has beenan increase in the number of network and application services that are distributedthroughout large networks. The distribution of services makes it difficult for users and mobileagents to locate the required host services. This problem is more pronounced for mobileagents which unlike human users are not able to draw on a variety of information sourcesand services. Mobile agents make use of directory services to obtain location information.This paper presents a unification model for extending directory services.

Dynamically generated user-specified MAS,Glenn Jayaputera; Arkady Zaslavsky; Seng Loke,Abstract This paper presents an innovative multi-agent system development approachcalled mission-based on-demand agent generation. This approach allows agents to bedynamically composed at run-time and most importantly; only when needed. Such anapproach is different from the conventional one; where agents are generally composed atdesign time. Our model of a mission allows the MAS to be suspended and resumed at laterstage at the same or different location. We present the formal model of the mission; thestrategy to execute the mission and the architecture of the prototype system called eHermes.Finally; we report the experimental results that shows that eHermes handles the loadsatisfactorily and performs the run-time optimization well.,International Workshop on Agent-Oriented Software Engineering,2005,7

Towards an information systems framework for dynamic organisational memory,Frada Burstein; Henry Linger; Arkady Zaslavsky; Nick Crofts,Organisational memory information systems (OMIS) implement important aspects oforganisational memory with the aim of enhancing organisational effectiveness. We proposea three layered framework for a dynamic OMIS. The framework consists of a pragmatic layerto support the actual activity; a conceptual layer to store the concepts (meta knowledge)inherent in that activity; and a process layer to store the experience of performing thatactivity. Both the conceptual and process layers represent organisational memoryrepositories in the form of respective models. The implementation of OMIS assumes that anyactivity is the instantiation of relevant conceptual and process models and includes thereuse of knowledge stored in association with those models. In this way organisationalmemory is always mapped to current activity; its adequacy constantly evaluated.

Port-based multihomed mobile ipv6: Load-balancing in mobile ad hoc networks,Robert Brannstrom; Christer Ahlund; Arkady Zaslavsky,With today's heterogeneous access to the Internet; users will move between wired andwireless environments and between infrastructure mode and ad hoc mode of wirelesscommunication. When a mobile node moves from an infrastructure connection and connectsmultihop to an Internet gateway; the performance will degrade and it may not be able tosend all of its traffic via a single gateway. This highlights the need of load-balancingbetween Internet gateways; especially since the behavior of users today involves a multitudeof parallel activities generating multiple flows. This paper proposes a solution that enablesdistribution of individual traffic flows via different Internet gateways instead of using onesingle gateway. The proposal includes extensions to mobile IP in order to handle flowmobility bindings. The performance of the solution is verified by simulation studies.,Local Computer Networks; 2007.

Effective privacy-preserving online route planning,Carmen Ruiz Vicente; Ira Assent; Christian S Jensen,An online Route Planning Service (RPS) computes a route from one location to another.Current RPSs such as Google Maps require the use of precise locations. However; someusers may not want to disclose their source and destination locations due to privacyconcerns. An approach that supplies fake locations to an existing service incurs asubstantial loss of quality of service; and the service may well return a result that may be nothelpful to the user. We propose a solution that is able to return accurate route planningresults when source and destination regions are used in order to achieve privacy. Thesolution re-uses a standard online RPS rather than replicate this functionality; and it needsno trusted third party. The solution is able to compute the exact results without leaking of theexact locations to the RPS or un-trusted parties.

Expressing dynamics of mobile agent systems using ambient calculus,Peter Stañski; Arkady Zaslavsky,The mobile agent approach has become popular due to recent developments in the mobilecode paradigm and enabling programming technologies. Many existing agent-basedsystems lack clear standards and rely upon their own approaches and solutions tochallenging research problems. Additionally; this rapid evolution has been poorly supportedwith formal methods. Ambient calculus has been recently proposed as a theoreticalframework for distributed and mobile objects/agents. This paper analyses ambient calculusand how it may be used to model the mobility of software objects. A number of extensions tothis framework are also proposed to describe various components within a mobile agentsystem.,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 1998. Proceedings.

Supporting cooperative databases with distributed objects,Zahir Tari; Arkady Zaslavsky; Iztok Savnik,Abstract This paper addresses the architectural issues of the DOK (Distributed ObjectKernel) system that provides core services for building cooperative database applications.The DOK logical architecture has clear separation of components and involves acoordination layer; a task layer and a database layer. Each of these layers contains a set ofspecialised agents providing specific functions related to cooperative computation. When auser requests about information that are managed by the DOK system; the coordinationagents identify and delegate the subparts of the query to appropriate agents of the tasklayer. The specialised agents; in turn; use the agents of the database layer to access therequired information to process the different sub-parts of the global request. One of theimportant agents of the DOK system is the wrapper coordination agent. A wrapper …,In" Parallel and Distributed Systems: Theory and Applications"; JL Aguilar Castro (Editor); Int.

Do-it-yourself content delivery network orchestrator,Rajiv Ranjan; Karan Mitra; Suhit Saha; Dimitrios Georgakopoulos; Arkady Zaslavsky,Abstract Content delivery networks (CDNs)[1] provide fast and reliable content access to theend-users. CDN providers (eg; Akamai [2]); either own the entire infrastructure or it isoutsourced to a single Cloud provider. Content owners (eg; clients and end-users) need toestablish expensive contracts with third party ISPs or CDN providers. Hence; existing CDNservices are out of reach for all but large enterprises. Current CDNs do not provide servicesthat allow an end-user to create dynamic content such as combining music videos from anexisting content source on the Internet. Finally; the content owners do not have low-levelcontrol over the orchestration operations such as; multiple Cloud provider selection andresource management for hosting content. Hence; the content owners are dependent ontheir CDN providers to perform these operations behind the scene.,Proceedings of the 13th international conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2012,3

Formal Verification of the Context Model: Enhanced Context Spaces Theory Approach,Andrey Boytsov; Arkady Zaslavsky,Abstract Pervasive computing is a paradigm that focuses on availability and non-intrusiveintegration of computing services into everyday life. Context awareness is the basic principleof pervasive computing. The important part of high-level context awareness is situationawareness–the ability to detect and reason about the real-life situations. The specificationsof situations are often carried out manually by the experts. Therefore; the specification errorscan be introduced. The specification errors cause the situation reasoning problems andcontext model inconsistency. In this article we propose and analyze the approach for formalverification of the situation definitions. Our solution uses as an input the situationspecification in terms of low-level context features and the properties under verification; andthen either formally proves that the specifications do comply with the expected property …,*,2011,3
Reliable and energy efficient backup clustering scheme for wireless sensor networks,Anwar Sadat; Gour Karmakar; Arkady Zaslavsky; M Gaber,abstract=" One of the major challenges in wireless sensor networks (WSN) is to meet theenergy constraint of its sensor nodes while ensuring reliability of the system. Clustering is aneffective self-organization approach to offer energy-efficient communication for WSNs.However; energy of a sensor node dynamically decreases when it plays a role of a clusterhead. As a result some nodes die faster that shorten overall network lifetime and reducereliability.

Extending the buddy model to secure variable sized multi agent communities,Maria Indrawan; John Premjeet Page; Arkady Zaslavsky,Abstract: This paper describes an extension of the Buddy model of agent security. TheBuddy model provides a security layer that encapsulates all agents within the multi-agentcommunity and therefore; extends a security cover to all agents of the community. While thecurrent model is able to service several scenarios involving fixed sized agent communities; itdoes not consider variable sized agent communities. This paper describes an extension tothe existing model that covers this aspect. The proposed extension increases the applicationcoverage and flexibility of the Buddy model and makes it a potent security mechanism formulti-agent communities. Further; the paper establishes that agent migration does not leadto any schema operating overheads; on the contrary it contributes to maintaining an effectivelevel of performance integrity within the schema.,International Workshop on Safety and Security in Multiagent Systems: 26/07/2005-26/07/2005,2005,3

Adaptive mining techniques for data streams using algorithm output granularity mohamed,Mohamed Medhat Gaber; Shonali Krishnaswamy; Arkady Zaslavsky,Abstract Mining data streams is an emerging area of research given the potentially largenumber of business and scientific applications. A significant challenge in analyzing/miningdata streams is the high data rate of the stream. In this paper; we propose a novel approachto cope with the high data rate of incoming data streams. We termed our approach"algorithm output granularity". It is a resource-aware approach that is adaptable to availablememory; time constraints; and data stream rate. The approach is generic and applicable toclustering; classification and counting frequent items mining techniques. We havedeveloped a data stream clustering algorithm based on the algorithm output granularityapproach. We present this algorithm and discuss its implementation and empiricalevaluation. The experiments show acceptable accuracy accompanied with run-time …,Workshop (AusDM 2003); Held in conjunction with the 2003 Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC 2003,2003,3

Adaptive cache validation for mobile file systems,Simon Cuce; Arkady Zaslavsky,Abstract The uneven advancement in computing hardware components has restricted thedevelopment of mobile computing technology. Key components like bandwidth and batterylife have only improved slightly over the last decade. Compounding this problem; systemsare failing to address these constraints; focusing on cache consistency rather thanaccessibility. We propose a system that refocuses the design methodology towards fileaccessibility by offering a means of cache validation while disconnected. By using fileinformation in the form of a file map stored locally; the likely status of a file can bedetermined. Thus the system can decide on an appropriate course of action without theassociated cost of full validation of files. By offering a secondary means of validation;resources can be utilised more efficiently by directing tasks to processors rather than …,*,1999,3
Conceptual development of an information systems framework for improving continuity in epidemiological research,Henry Linger; Frada Burstein; Arkady Zaslavsky; Campbell Aitken; Nick Crofts,Abstract Lack of continuity is a problem for survey-based epidemiological research. Pooraccess to experience and inadequate retention of information means new projects seldombuild on successful predecessors to the maximum possible extent. We have designed a datamanagement framework which addresses this problem using a well-known informationsystems approach. Our ideas provide a means of storing data in a manner which reflects theoriginal research concepts. This makes collected data accessible and understandablewithout reference to the questionnaire; and allows new questionnaires to be designedquickly and easily. Our framework provides a means for recording developmental;conceptual and other supporting information and documentation which is traditionally poorlyconserved. We illustrate the components of the framework using a major Australian …,European journal of epidemiology,1998,3
Efficient object-oriented query optimisation in mobile computing environment,XD Zhou; Arkady Zaslavsky; Aamir Rasheed; Rosanne Price,Convergence of object-oriented technologies with advances in computer andcommunications technologies will lead to new paradigms and approaches to building object-based distributed systems; including mobile computing systems.

Petri nets analysis of transaction and submitter management protocols in mobile distributed computing environment,Arkady Zaslavsky; LH Yeo; Simon J Lai; Boris Mitelman,This paper proposes and discusses a simulation model of a message and transactionqueuing protocol which supports submission of transactions from mobile workstations in adistributed multidatabase environment. The model is based on coloured Petri netsformalism. A hierarchical coloured Petri nets model describing the two key components ofthe protocol; namely message queuing facility and transaction queuing facility; isconstructed and analyzed using the software tool Design/CPN. Simulation of message andtransaction processing algorithms has been carried out to verify and refine the design of theproposed protocol. The tool has also enabled us to assess the practicality of the developedapproach and study the impact of the protocol implementation.

CDQL: A Generic Context Representation and Querying Approach for Internet of Things Applications,Alireza Hassani; Pari Delir Haghighi; Prem Prakash Jayaraman; Arkady Zaslavsky; Sea Ling; Alexey Medvedev,Abstract As the standardization efforts for IoT is fast progressing; we will quickly get to a pointwhere context derived from IoT data and relations will be the underpinning factor to enableinteraction between" smart things". Therefore; having a generic approach for describing andquerying context is crucial for the future of IoT applications. In this paper; we proposeContext Definition and Query Language (CDQL); an advanced approach that enables thingsto exchange context. CDQL consists of two main parts: Context Definition Model; which isdesigned to describe the contextual attributes and context related capabilities of each"thing"; and Context Query Language (CQL); which is a flexible query language to expresscontextual information requirements without considering details of the underlying datastructure. We exemplify the usage of the proposed CDQL; via a smart city use case study …,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Advances in Mobile Computing and Multi Media,2016,2

Correctness analysis and verification of fuzzy situations in situation aware pervasive computing systems,Andrey Boytsov; Arkady Zaslavsky,Abstract Context awareness is one of the central features of pervasive computing systems.From pervasive computing perspective a situation can be defined as external semanticinterpretation of context. Situation awareness aims to infer situations out of context.Developing situation awareness is a challenging task; which can be significantly hamperedby errors during design stage. In this article we propose a novel method for verification offuzzy situation definitions. Fuzzy logic is a powerful mechanism for reasoning in pervasivecomputing systems and verification of situation models is a new method of formally ensuringcorrectness of context awareness and situation awareness. Verification is applied at thedesign time to check that definitions of situations are error-free.

Building activity definitions to recognize complex activities using an online activity toolkit,Saguna Saguna; Arkady Zaslavsky; Dipanjan Chakraborty,One of the biggest challenges in the field of activity recognition is gathering training data forbuilding activity inference models. To address this problem; we have developed an onlineactivity toolkit for gathering activity data from online users. We use this data to build activitydefinitions for use in our system which is based on Context-Driven Activity Theory. We useMarkov chain analysis to assign weights to activities and context attributes of a complexactivity as well as to build activity signatures based on transition and path probabilities. Ourdemo is intended to show how complex activities and associated atomic activities andcontext attributes can be described using an activity toolkit. The toolkit is used to take inputfrom users available online and the results analysis of different complex activities can beviewed online in near real-time using the graphical user interface (GUI).,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2012 IEEE 13th International Conference on,2012,2

A case retrieval approach using similarity and association knowledge,Yong-Bin Kang; Shonali Krishnaswamy; Arkady Zaslavsky,Abstract Retrieval is often considered the most important phase in Case-Based Reasoning(CBR); since it lays the foundation for overall performance of CBR systems. Retrieval in CBRaims to retrieve relevant cases that can be successfully used for solving a new problem. Torealize retrieval; CBR systems typically rely on a strategy that exploits similarity knowledge;and it is called similarity-based retrieval (SBR). In SBR; similarity knowledge approximatesthe usefulness of cases for solving a new problem. In this paper; we show that associationanalysis of stored cases can be used to strengthen SBR. We present a new approach forextracting and representing association knowledge from the cases using association rulemining. We propose a novel retrieval strategy USIMSCAR that qualitatively enhances SBRby leveraging both similarity and association knowledge.

Overcoming uncertainty of roadside sensors with smart adaptive traffic congestion analysis system,Panraphee Raphiphan; Arkady Zaslavsky; Passakon Prathombutr; Phayung Meesad,Real time traffic congestion degree is useful information in assisting decision making ofdrivers. It can also be a factor for calculating other traffic information. The congestion degreecan be usually calculated on the basis of sensors installed along roads. It is possible that thesensory data can be lost due to potentially unreliable communication or faulty sensors;leading to lost of important traffic data. In this paper; we propose both adaptive trafficcongestion analysis system architecture as well as a novel traffic congestion estimationalgorithm that can compensate missing sensory data. An ability to provide traffic condition ofroad segments at all time is feasible. Unlike other existing methods; our approach aims notto rely on only traffic data from sensors; but utilize discoverable external context instead.

The mission is a high-level abstraction that combinesthe overall goal of a system; the means and the process of achieving that goal; and is thebasis from which agents can be automatically generated. We propose a mechanism togenerate agents on-demand and at run-time based on a given mission. Run-time missionevolution is systematically captured and maintained; allowing the mission to be suspendedand resumed at a later stage at the same or different locations.

Capturing buying behaviour using a layered user model,Oshadi Alahakoon; Seng Loke; Arkady Zaslavsky,Abstract User models are important tools for personalization; especially in ecommerceapplications. But capturing dynamically changing user needs is a challenge. One of thereasons for such difficulty is that the purchasing behavior of an individual is based on anumber of different aspects. In this paper we identify these aspects as a combination ofdemographics; domain based expectations and transactions. Since each individual candemonstrate a unique combination of these aspects; to achieve finer personalization; suchindividuality will have to be captured in user models. In this paper we propose such a usermodel architecture; which also has the ability to self-improve adapting to changes ofindividual behavior and long term modeling possibilities.,*,2007,2

Location Awareness and Privacy in Pervasive Applications,Alexander Ng; Arkady Zaslavsky,Abstract The ability to 'smartly'ascertain and adapt to the context of a situation or scenario isknown as context awareness. A significant element of context aware systems lies in the useof location based services. Location is an important contextual parameter in context awarecomputing; and can affect various modes of interaction between user and application. Withthe increased use of data services in mobile computing today; wireless security isparamount and lacking. However; the use of location parameters is also closely tied in tosecurity issues such as security; privacy and resource usage problems on mobile clients.

We term this process of translating aknowledge discovery rule and incorporating it into a database schema in the form of an ECA(event-condition-action) rule as database schema refinement. We introduce a new ruleidentification measure for categorising knowledge discovery rules into semantic integrityconstraints and probabilistic rules; which forms the basis for determining the mode ofconstraint enforcement in the enriched schema. This measure is based on databasestatistics and history. Using this measure we estimate and model both the static and dynamiccharacteristics of a given rule. The rule classification process is followed by the generation ofthe ECA equivalents. We present a generic technique and show how this is implemented …,Systems Sciences; 1999. HICSS-32.

Twin-Transactions—Delayed Transaction Synchronisation Model,Aamir Rasheed; Arkady Zaslavsky,Abstract In a mobile computing environment; mobile hosts are not available all the time. Dueto this reason; mobile computers are usually considered as clients who can connect todifferent servers and ask for certain services (client-server). To reduce the contention on thenarrow bandwidth of the wireless channel; it is suggested to cache part of a database onmobile computers [1]. When a mobile computer also hosts data (or a portion of a data); thedata on such hosts will not be available all the time. Replication of such data will make thedata available; but will create certain concurrency and consistency problems. The twin-transaction model (TTM) proposes to replicate transaction-processing flow along with dataitems stored on mobile hosts.,European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming,1998,2

A simulation model of adaptive protocols in distributed computing systems with mobile hosts,Simon J Lai; Arkady Zaslavsky; GM Martin,Simulation is a scientific method which is largely dominated by computers and has allowedthe testing and assessment of many models before actual implementation. The paperproposes an approach to construction of a simulation that models the behaviour of anadaptive queuing protocol (AQP). AQP was developed for database applications on mobilecomputers in a distributed multidatabase environment but can also be used in many otherareas including distributed operating systems.

Opportunistic data collection for IoT-based indoor air quality monitoring,Aigerim Zhalgasbekova; Arkady Zaslavsky; Saguna Saguna; Karan Mitra; Prem Prakash Jayaraman,Abstract Opportunistic sensing advance methods of IoT data collection using the mobility ofdata mules; the proximity of transmitting sensor devices and cost efficiency to decide when;where; how and at what cost collect IoT data and deliver it to a sink. This paper proposes;develops; implements and evaluates the algorithm called CollMule which builds on andextends the 3D kNN approach to discover; negotiate; collect and deliver the sensed data inan energy-and cost-efficient manner. The developed CollMule software prototype usesAndroid platform to handle indoor air quality data from heterogeneous IoT devices. TheCollMule evaluation is based on performing rate; power consumption and CPU usage ofsingle algorithm cycle. The outcomes of these experiments prove the feasibility of CollMuleuse on mobile smart devices.,*,2017,1
Towards semantic interoperability in an open IoT ecosystem for connected vehicle services,Niklas Kolbe; Sylvain Kubler; Jérémy Robert; Yves Le Traon; Arkady Zaslavsky,A present challenge in today's Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem is to enable interoperabilityacross heterogeneous systems and service providers. Restricted access to data sourcesand services limits the capabilities of a smart city to improve social; environmental andeconomic aspects. Interoperability in the IoT is concerned with both; messaging interfacesand semantic understanding of heterogeneous data. In this paper; the first building blocks ofan emerging open IoT ecosystem developed at the EU level are presented. Semantic webtechnologies are applied to the existing messaging components to support and improvesemantic interoperability. The approach is demonstrated with a proof-of-concept forconnected vehicle services in a smart city setting.,Global Internet of Things Summit (GIoTS); 2017,2017,1
Storing and indexing IoT context for smart city applications,Alexey Medvedev; Arkady Zaslavsky; Maria Indrawan-Santiago; Pari Delir Haghighi; Alireza Hassani,Abstract IoT system interoperability; data fusion; data discovery and access control forproviding Context-as-a-Service as well as tools for building context-aware smart cityapplications are all significant research challenges for IoT-enabled smart cities. Thesemiddleware platforms have to cope with potentially big data generated from millions ofdevices in large cities.

Reasoning over knowledge-based generation of situations in context spaces to reduce food waste,Niklas Kolbe; Arkady Zaslavsky; Sylvain Kubler; Jérémy Robert,Abstract Situation awareness is a key feature of pervasive computing and requires externalknowledge to interpret data. Ontology-based reasoning approaches allow for the reuse ofpredefined knowledge; but do not provide the best reasoning capabilities. To overcome thisproblem; a hybrid model for situation awareness is developed and presented in this paper;which integrates the Situation Theory Ontology into Context Space Theory for inference.Furthermore; in an effort to rely as much as possible on open IoT messaging standards; adomain-independent framework using the O-MI/O-DF standards for sensor data acquisitionis developed. This framework is applied to a smart neighborhood use case to reduce foodwaste at the consumption stage.,*,2016,1
Discovery in the Internet of Things,Arkady Zaslavsky; Prem Prakash Jayaraman,How to find a thing in the internet of things (IoT) haystack? The answer to this question willbe the key challenge that IoT users and developers are facing now and will face in thefuture. Current models for IoT are focused heavily on developing vertical solutions limited byhardware and software platforms and support. With the estimated explosion of IoT in thecoming years as predicted by Cisco; IBM and Gartner; there is a need to rethink how IoT candeliver value to the end-user. A paradigm shift is required in the underlying fundamentals ofcurrent IoT developments to enable a wider notion of “thing” discovery as well as discoveryof relevant data and context on the IoT. Discovery will allow users to build IoT apps; servicesand applications using “smart things” without the need for a priori knowledge of things. Inthis article; we look at the current state of IoT and argue for paradigm shift addressing why …,ACM Ubiquity Magazine,2015,1
High Capacity Trucks Serving as Mobile Depots for Waste Collection in IoT-Enabled Smart Cities,Theodoros Anagnostopoulos; Arkady Zaslavsky; Stefanos Georgiou; Sergey Khoruzhnikov,Abstract Internet of Things (IoT) enables Smart Cities with novel services. Waste collection inSmart Cities becomes a dynamic process with the proliferation of sensors and actuatorsembedded on real waste bins. Heterogeneous fleets of trucks are used for efficient wastecollection exploiting the diverse road network. In this paper we propose a novel approach byincorporating Low Capacity Trucks (LCTs) and High Capacity Trucks (HCTs). However;HCTs are serving as Mobile Depots (MDs) which are cost efficient and decongest traffic inSmart Cities. A detailed system overview illustrates the architecture of the proposedapproach. We also propose novel algorithms which support dynamic waste collection withMDs. Scheduling and routing are transformed to dynamic models. Specifically; we propose anovel scheduling algorithm while we customize an existing routing algorithm. The models …,Conference on Smart Spaces,2015,1

Improving Efficiency of Service-Oriented Context-Driven Software Agents,Kutila Gunasekera; Seng Wai Loke; Arkady Zaslavsky; Shonali Krishnaswamy,The case for integrating software agent and web service paradigms has been welldocumented; and we believe that convergence of these two paradigms; enhanced withcontext awareness; can enable more efficient and effective pervasive services. Softwareagents in service-oriented environments have traditionally been limited to either using;providing; or aggregating services. We propose that in dynamic heterogeneousenvironments it would be sometimes beneficial if the agent; in addition to invoking remoteservices; could acquire the capacity to execute functionality provided by the service and runit locally. To this end; we build a performance analysis model that compares timeconsumption and network load of service access with that of component use. We argue thatsuch a model would allow an agent to dynamically select the more efficient alternative …,Cybernetics and Systems,2011,1
A retrieval strategy using the integrated knowledge of similarity and associations,Yong-Bin Kang; Shonali Krishnaswamy; Arkady Zaslavsky,Abstract Retrieval is often considered the most important task in Case-Based Reasoning(CBR); since it lays the foundation for overall performance of CBR systems. In CBR; a typicalretrieval strategy is realized through similarity knowledge encoded in similarity measures.This strategy is often called similarity-based retrieval (SBR). This paper proposes andvalidates that association analysis techniques can be used to improve SBR. We propose aretrieval strategy USIMSCAR that performs the retrieval task by integrating similarity andassociation knowledge. We show its reliability; in comparison with several retrieval methodsimplementing SBR; using datasets from UCI ML Repository.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2011,1

Real time traffic congestion degree computation for minor sensorless roads using cost efficient context reasoning,Panraphee Raphiphan; Passakon Prathombutr; Arkady Zaslavsky; Phayung Meesad,Traffic congestion is the cause of pollution and economic loss. The Real time traffic statereport can alleviate this problem by assisting drivers for route planning and choosingunblocked roads. More traffic information could lead to more accurate route planning andgreater awareness of traffic situations and road conditions for drivers. However; investmentinto sensor infrastructure for small minor roads is rarely available. In this paper; we present acost efficient approach to compute real time traffic congestion degrees for non-sensorinfrastructure roads; such as small minor roads; based on context fusion and contextreasoning method. Our framework intends to utilize real time acquirable context instead ofrelying on traffic sensory data which made our approach suitable for insufficient sensorinfrastructure environment.

Generic fault-tolerant layer supporting publish/subscribe messaging in mobile agent systems,Milovan Tosic; Arkady Zaslavsky,Abstract With the introduction of clustered messaging brokers and the fault-tolerant MobileConnector; we can guarantee the exactly-once consumption of messages by agents. Thecontext-aware messaging allowed us to decrease the messaging overhead which has to bepresent in any fault-tolerant solution. This paper proposes a complete fault-tolerant layer formulti-agent systems (EFTL) that does not restrict agent autonomy and mobility in any way.An application can choose if it wants EFTL support and that decision is based on supportcosts. A persistent publish/subscribe messaging model allows the creation of an externalplatformindependent fault-tolerant layer. In order to support the multi-agent platforms ofdifferent vendors; a large part of the application logic is moved from those platforms to anapplication server.

Modeling and adapting to Context changes: The case of stock market decisions making,Jacques Ajenstat; Seng Wai Loke; Arkady Zaslavsky,Abstract. A stock market decision making makes a compelling case for the use of contextaware systems that can adapt to a context behavior known as 'random walk'. To defend sucha proposition the paper adopts the formulation typically used in sensor driven applicationsthat involves critical context characteristics of pervasiveness and instability. From thepervasive perspective the paper concentrates on the ability to characterize a context-statetrajectory behavior in real-time to proactively estimate the trend of context change. From theperspective of instability it discusses context related mechanisms such as hedging withderivative instruments as a way to caliber context aware system sensitivity to contextualchanges.

A rule measure to represent the temporal changes of data mining patterns,Shonali Krishnaswamy; Arkady Zaslavsky,Abstract Data mining is the automated extraction of hitherto unknown patterns in largedatabases. Patterns or rules extracted by mining algorithms are generally true for the currentstate of the database. As the database state changes due to new transactions these rulesmay either become invalid or may have increased support. In this paper we present a newrule measure–Rule Trend Analysis (RTA)–which quantifies and represents the trend orbehaviour of patterns extracted by data mining systems as these rules evolve along acontinuous time interval. This measure is derived using the database log file by analysingtransactions that are compliant with the rule and those that are not. We present both thetheoretical aspects as well as the results obtained by implementing this technique of datamining rule analysis.,International Workshop on Computer Science and Information Technologies: 18/01/1999-22/01/1999,1999,1

Proactive QoE Provisioning in Heterogeneous Access Networks using Hidden Markov Models and Reinforcement Learning,Karan Mitra; Christer Åhlund; Arkady Zaslavsky; Saguna Saguna,Abstract: Quality of Experience (QoE) provisioning in heterogeneous access networks(HANs) can be achieved via handoffs. The current approaches for QoE-aware handoffseither lack the availability of a network path probing method or lack the availability of efficientmethods for QoE prediction. Further; the current approaches do not explore the benefits ofproactive QoE-aware handoffs such that user's QoE is maximized by learning from pastnetwork conditions and by actions taken by the mobile device regarding handoffs. In thispaper; our contributions are two-fold. First; we propose; develop and validate a novelmethod for QoE prediction based on passive probing. Our method is based on hiddenMarkov models and Multi-homed Mobility Management Protocol which eliminates the needfor additional probe packets for QoE prediction.

We also propose a new context-aware subscription language enabling publishers to express data with sufficient contextualinformation and subscribers to subscribe to data by matching publisher context tosubscribers contextual preferences. Finally; as a proof of concept; we extend the ApacheActiveMQ Artemis software and create a client prototype. We evaluate our proof of conceptfor larger scale deployment.,*,2016,*

INCORPORATING MOBILITY INTO AN AGENT INTEROPERABILITY-BASED ENVIRONMENT,Arkady Zaslavsky,Software agents are considered at present as a promising paradigm for many distributedapplications. Basic features of such agents include autonomy; goal-oriented behaviour;ability to learn and ability to communicate with other agents (interoperability) for problemsolving [2; 17; 24]. The above-mentioned features are mainly considered inintelligent/software agents research community. However; there is another agent feature–mobility–which refers to agents ability to migrate from one host to another and it is mostlyconsidered in mobile agents research community. In spite of mutual interest of the above-mentioned communities in integrating their work most of agent-based systems are stilldivided by their belonging either to intelligent [3; 4; 5; 8; 16; 18] or mobile agentscommunities [10; 19; 21; 22; 23].

Measuring Quality of Experience in Pervasive Systems Using Probabilistic Context-Aware Approach,Karan Mitra; Arkady Zaslavsky; Christer Åhlund,Abstract In this paper; we pioneer a context-aware approach for quality of experience (QoE)modeling; reasoning and inferencing in mobile and pervasive computing environments. Theproposed model is based upon Context Spaces Theory (CST) and influence diagrams (IDs)to handle uncertain and hidden complex inter-dependencies between user-perceived andnetwork level QoS and to calculate overall QoE of the users. This helps in user-relatedmedia; network and device adaptation; creating user-level SLAs and minimizing networkchurn.

Service oriented context-aware software agents for greater efficiency,Kutila Gunasekera; Arkady Zaslavsky; Shonali Krishnaswamy; Seng Wai Loke,Abstract Convergence of web service technology with intelligent and mobile agenttechnology; enhanced with context awareness; can produce a new software paradigm thatwill enable more efficient and effective mobile services. Traditionally; an agent has been apassive service requestor with the service processing happening at the provider's site. Wepropose that in some situations it would be beneficial if the agent could acquire the ability toexecute the functionality provided by the service and run it locally instead of simply using theservice. To this end; we build an analytical model which compares time consumption oftraditional service access with that of component use. Such a model would allow an agent todynamically select the more efficient approach. We describe experiments which comparethe two approaches and discuss the results and lessons learnt.,KES International Symposium on Agent and Multi-Agent Systems: Technologies and Applications,2010,*

Context Modeling for Cross-layer Context Aware Adaptations,Ruwini Kodikara; Christer Ahlund,Abstract Demand for real-time services over the Internet while moving; is growing rapidly.This necessitates efficient delivery of wireless real-time traffic. Limitations of existing layeredprotocol stack for wireless networks lead to the proposal of cross-layer interactions as analternative solution. At the same time; next generation ubiquitous computing drives wirelessapplications and protocols to be context aware. A generic context aware architecture withcontext modeling can aid increasingly demanding realtime applications over highly dynamicwireless networks to be cross-layer context aware and adaptive. Moreover; a genericarchitecture can make lower layer protocols to be context aware and adaptive to varioussituations dynamically.

Distributed context aware system for travel time estimation based on cellular probes in metropolitan environment,Wasan Patara-Atikom; Passakon Prathombutr; Panraphee Raphiphan; Arkady Zaslavsky,Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Many techniques for estimating travel time onvarious routes based on different types of sensors were proposed. In the past; stationarysensors were more popular; but they came with inflexibility; extra investment; and disruptionto traffic flow during installation and maintenance. Global Positioning System (GPS) devicescan also be used as mobile sensors but the signal penetration can be limited in the cityenvironment. In this paper; we propose architecture of a context aware system for travel timeestimation based on cellular probes in city environment. A cellular probe technique is ourpreference since necessary infrastructure is already in place without the weaknesses ofstationary sensor techniques and GPS devices.

User profiles with common modules for multiple domains,O Alahakoon; Seng Wai Loke; Arkady Zaslavsky,Personalization using profiles of the users has become an important feature in the fastgrowing number of e-commerce applications. In current applications; these profiles areusually tailored to the application domains. Therefore separate profiles have to begenerated and maintained for each different application domain. Each time a new needarises; users have to reveal their personal details or/and needs to new applications. Toovercome this limitation we propose a novel modular user profile; which has layers ofinformation enabling these to be used across multiple application domains. The proposedmodel consists of three layers where information related to a particular user is separatedaccording to" domain dependence".,IPSI-2005: 06/01/2005-09/01/2005,2005,*
Personalization across De-centralized Domains with a Modular User Profile Architecture,Oshadi Alahakoon; Seng Loke; Arkady Zaslavsky,Abstract-User profiling has been used to provide personalized e-services. In our previouswork we have highlighted the advantages of a modular approach to developing userprofiles. This approach separates the information to be stored into levels according to thedependency level on the customer or transaction. Therefore the customer's personalinformation is stored in a separate layer while individual transaction information is stored inanother layer. A middle layer stores information generalized from the individual transactions;which are used to reduce the need for obtrusive information extraction from a customerduring a subsequent transaction. In this paper; we highlight the advantages of the modularuser profiles when used in a de-centralized setting. The separate layers provide a flexiblestructure; which provide the possibility of locating in vendor; server or client sites.

Adaptive Cache Validation for Mobile File,Simon Cuce; Arkady Zaslavsky,Abstract. The uneven advancement in computing hardware components has restricted thedevelopment of mobile computing technology. Key components like bandwidth and batterylife have only improved slightly over the last decade. Compounding this problem; systemsare failing to address these constraints; focusing on cache consistency rather thanaccessibility. We propose a system that refocuses the design methodology towards fileaccessibility by offering a means of cache validation while disconnected. By using fileinformation in the form of a file map stored locally; the likely status of a file can bedetermined. Thus the system can decide on an appropriate course of action without the asso-ciated cost of full validation of files. By offering a secondary means of validation; resourcescan be utilised more efficiently by directing tasks to processors rather than bandwidth.,Advances in Database Technologies: ER'98 Workshops on Data Warehousing and Data Mining; Mobile Data Access; and Collaborative Work Support and Spatio-Temporal Data Management; Singapore; November 19-20; 1998; Proceedings,2004,*

Adding value to marketplaces by assembling location-aware agents on-demand,Glenn Jayaputera; SW Loke; Arkady Zaslavsky,Abstract With the penetration of ubiquitous computing into physical marketplaces;requirements for software agents have increased also. The need for software agents atanytime; anyplace and helping the consumers with their shopping experience is becomingmore obvious. Request from the consumers are changing all the time as well as the physicalmarketplace they are in (hence also the merchants). These conditions mean that a systemthat has a predefined number of agents; with each of them possessing a predefined set offunctionality is not suitable for use. We propose a system; named eHermes; whichassembles agents on-demand based on the user request and preferences. Sucharchitecture supports dynamism and flexibility at run-time that are suitable for the pervasivecomputing environment.

Building a collaborative information agent in a homebot application,Lito Perez Cruz; Arkady Zaslavsky; David Squire,Abstract Information agents are cooperative agents whose main goal is to collaborate andassist task agents like mobile agents in obtaining information from heterogeneous datasources. Considering the current tools and techniques available in the community; this studysets out to find the practical problems that a developer might encounter in the process ofengineering an information agent in the context of a real estate agent HomeBot application.In this technology assessment report; we provide here the approach for circumventing themand document the lessons we have learned. Our assessment is that the construction of aninformation agent based on current agent building technologies is feasible but not seamless.More importantly; we contend that what is needed is a wholistic tool that integrates smoothlyvarious sub-technologies together.

Resource Billing in Mobile Agent Based Heterogeneous Distributed Information Systems,Martin Pirotta; Arkady Zaslavsky,Abstract The research of billing schemes for computational resources is fundamental toinformation economy. Software agents that roam the Internet are consumers of resources. Inthis paper we first outline the surgeoncy of information economy as a result of computationalresources being made available to the general public and their software agents. Wepropose a billing scheme for the usage of such resources using e-wallets and Internetdollars. The proposed billing scheme is applied to a community of mobile agents that live;and roam across a number of nodes; which provide the necessary resources and servicesused by these agents. An integrated service is charged at a dynamically computed rate atthe end of a provider and agent negotiation phase. The paper also puts forward ways ofachieving secure and reliable payments.

Run-time file system consistency support in mobile computing systems,Simon Cuce; Arkady Zaslavsky,With the increased heterogeneity of networked devices integrating into existing distributedfile system (DFS) topologies; the ability to balance hardware constraints with user andsoftware requirements is paramount. This is especially true for consistency control in filesystems with replication. Exiting DFSs usually implement a single general-purposeconsistency approach; focusing on a specific scenario; rather than multitude of possibilitiesthat can arise due to heterogeneity and variability of a mobile computing environments. Thedeveloped GLOMAR system cater for the multitude of possibilities by providing theframework to allow numerous consistency control mechanisms specifically built for ascenario to e implemented under the one DFS.

Incorporating Mobility into an Agent Interoperability-Based Environment,Mihhail Matskin; Arkady Zaslavsky,Abstract Software agents are currently considered as a promising paradigm for manydistributed applications. Basic features of such agents include autonomy; goal-orientedbehaviour; ability to learn and ability to communicate with other agents (interoperability) forproblem solving. These features are mainly considered in intelligent agents researchcommunity. However; there is another agent feature—mobility—which refers to agents abilityto migrate from one host to another and it is mostly considered in mobile agents researchcommunity. In spite of mutual interest of the above-mentioned communities in integratingtheir work most of agent-based systems are still divided by their affiliation either to intelligentor mobile agents communities.

The problemsassociated with delivering multimedia content to clients of varying capabilities are alsoinvestigated. Adaptivity is presented as a tool to extend the lifetime of critical applications aswell as a technique to meet client device variability. To this end we have developedprototypes for the mobile environments that aim to reduce dependency on scarce resources.The adaptation space framework is used to provide a flexible and consistent design strategy.,International Conference on Mobile Data Management,2001,*

J. Tan A. Zaslavsky,CA Ewald; A Bond,Abstract Federated or multidatabase systems; built up from multiple autonomous databasesystems; require a basic level of interoperability among the component database systems.They must also provide a reasonable degree of functionality similar to that of moderndatabase management systems; eg; queries. Many years of research by other groups havegone into this area; but not many of the proposed solutions have been commerciallyimplemented due to inherent complexities and relatively low probability of success. Thispaper discusses our interoperability solution that supports ad-hoc federations on aframework that adheres to technology standards. We hope to attract interest in ad-hocfederations which would be more responsive than rigid solutions. Through a standards-based solution; we hope to present an alternative approach that is practicable to …,*,*,*
Comparative Efficiency and Implementation Issues of Itinerant Agent Language on Different Agent Platforms,Abdullah Almuhaideb; Kutila Gunasekera; Arkady Zaslavsky; Seng Wai Loke,ABSTRACT An itinerary scripting language provides a tool to accelerate the development ofmobile agent applications. The main purpose of this paper is to discuss research challengesof itinerant mobile agents (ITAG) and describe the migration of ITAG to JADE; the popularFIPA-compliant agent platform. The migration process was based on two major steps: themigration of agent communications and agent tasks (behaviors). The ITAG Engine has beenextracted to provide an easy migration to any new agent platform. In our experiments theresults show that the current ITAGIII (using JADE) has better performance and stabilitycompared to ITAGII (using Grasshopper). The paper discusses the experiments andcomparisons in detail.,AT2AI-6: From Agent Theory to Agent Implementation,*,*
