Finding k-dominant skylines in high dimensional space,Chee-Yong Chan; HV Jagadish; Kian-Lee Tan; Anthony KH Tung; Zhenjie Zhang,Abstract Given a d-dimensional data set; a point p dominates another point q if it is betterthan or equal to q in all dimensions and better than q in at least one dimension. A point is askyline point if there does not exists any point that can dominate it. Skyline queries; whichreturn skyline points; are useful in many decision making applications. Unfortunately; as thenumber of dimensions increases; the chance of one point dominating another point is verylow. As such; the number of skyline points become too numerous to offer any interestinginsights. To find more important and meaningful skyline points in high dimensional space;we propose a new concept; called k-dominant skyline which relaxes the idea of dominanceto k-dominance. A point p is said to k-dominate another point q if there are k≤ d dimensionsin which p is better than or equal to q and is better in at least one of these k dimensions.

Mining top-n local outliers in large databases,Wen Jin; Anthony KH Tung; Jiawei Han,Abstract Outlier detection is an important task in data mining with numerous applications;including credit card fraud detection; video surveillance; etc. A recent work on outlierdetection has introduced a novel notion of local outlier in which the degree to which anobject is outlying is dependent on the density of its local neighborhood; and each object canbe assigned a Local Outlier Factor (LOF) which represents the likelihood of that object beingan outlier. Although the concept of local outliers is a useful one; the computation of LOFvalues for every data objects requires a large number of &kgr;-nearest neighbors searchesand can be computationally expensive. Since most objects are usually not outliers; it isuseful to provide users with the option of finding only n most outstanding local outliers; ie;the top-n data objects which are most likely to be local outliers according to their LOFs …,Proceedings of the seventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2001,383
Keyword search in spatial databases: Towards searching by document,Dongxiang Zhang; Yeow Meng Chee; Anirban Mondal; Anthony KH Tung; Masaru Kitsuregawa,This work addresses a novel spatial keyword query called the m-closest keywords (mCK)query. Given a database of spatial objects; each tuple is associated with some descriptiveinformation represented in the form of keywords. The mCK query aims to find the spatiallyclosest tuples which match m user-specified keywords. Given a set of keywords from adocument; mCK query can be very useful in geotagging the document by comparing thekeywords to other geotagged documents in a database. To answer mCK queries efficiently;we introduce a new index called the bR*-tree; which is an extension of the R*-tree. Based onbR*-tree; we exploit a priori-based search strategies to effectively reduce the search space.We also propose two monotone constraints; namely the distance mutex and keyword mutex;as our a priori properties to facilitate effective pruning.

Ranking outliers using symmetric neighborhood relationship,Wen Jin; Anthony KH Tung; Jiawei Han; Wei Wang,Abstract Mining outliers in database is to find exceptional objects that deviate from the rest ofthe data set. Besides classical outlier analysis algorithms; recent studies have focused onmining local outliers; ie; the outliers that have density distribution significantly different fromtheir neighborhood. The estimation of density distribution at the location of an object has sofar been based on the density distribution of its k-nearest neighbors [2; 11]. However; whenoutliers are in the location where the density distributions in the neighborhood aresignificantly different; for example; in the case of objects from a sparse cluster close to adenser cluster; this may result in wrong estimation. To avoid this problem; here we proposea simple but effective measure on local outliers based on a symmetric neighborhoodrelationship. The proposed measure considers both neighbors and reverse neighbors of …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2006,273
On high dimensional skylines,Chee-Yong Chan; HV Jagadish; Kian-Lee Tan; Anthony KH Tung; Zhenjie Zhang,Abstract In many decision-making applications; the skyline query is frequently used to find aset of dominating data points (called skyline points) in a multi-dimensional dataset. In a high-dimensional space skyline points no longer offer any interesting insights as there are toomany of them. In this paper; we introduce a novel metric; called skyline frequency thatcompares and ranks the interestingness of data points based on how often they are returnedin the skyline when different number of dimensions (ie; subspaces) are considered.Intuitively; a point with a high skyline frequency is more interesting as it can be dominated onfewer combinations of the dimensions. Thus; the problem becomes one of finding top-kfrequent skyline points. But the algorithms thus far proposed for skyline computation typicallydo not scale well with dimensionality. Moreover; frequent skyline computation requires …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,261
Carpenter: Finding closed patterns in long biological datasets,Feng Pan; Gao Cong; Anthony KH Tung; Jiong Yang; Mohammed J Zaki,Abstract The growth of bioinformatics has resulted in datasets with new characteristics.These datasets typically contain a large number of columns and a small number of rows. Forexample; many gene expression datasets may contain 10;000-100;000 columns but only100-1000 rows. Such datasets pose a great challenge for existing (closed) frequent patterndiscovery algorithms; since they have an exponential dependence on the average rowlength. In this paper; we describe a new algorithm called CARPENTER that is speciallydesigned to handle datasets having a large number of attributes and relatively small numberof rows. Several experiments on real bioinformatics datasets show that CARPENTER isorders of magnitude better than previous closed pattern mining algorithms like CLOSET andCHARM.,Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2003,253
Spatial clustering in the presence of obstacles,Anthony KH Tung; Jean Hou; Jiawei Han,Clustering in spatial data mining is to group similar objects based on their distance;connectivity; or their relative density in space. In the real world there exist many physicalobstacles such as rivers; lakes and highways; and their presence may affect the result ofclustering substantially. We study the problem of clustering in the presence of obstacles anddefine it as a COD (Clustering with Obstructed Distance) problem. As a solution to thisproblem; we propose a scalable clustering algorithm; called COD-CLARANS. We discussvarious forms of pre-processed information that could enhance the efficiency of COD-CLARANS. In the strictest sense; the COD problem can be treated as a change in distancefunction and thus could be handled by current clustering algorithms by changing thedistance function. However; we show that by pushing the task of handling obstacles into …,Data Engineering; 2001. Proceedings. 17th International Conference on,2001,247
Constraint-based clustering in large databases,Anthony KH Tung; Jiawei Han; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Constrained clustering—finding clusters that satisfy user-specified constraints—ishighly desirable in many applications. In this paper; we introduce the constrained clusteringproblem and show that traditional clustering algorithms (eg; k-means) cannot handle it. Ascalable constraint-clustering algorithm is developed in this study which starts by finding aninitial solution that satisfies user-specified constraints and then refines the solution byperforming confined object movements under constraints. Our algorithm consists of twophases: pivot movement and deadlock resolution. For both phases; we show that finding theoptimal solution is NP-hard. We then propose several heuristics and show how ouralgorithm can scale up for large data sets using the heuristic of micro-cluster sharing. Byexperiments; we show the effectiveness and efficiency of the heuristics.,International Conference on Database Theory,2001,205
Comparing stars: On approximating graph edit distance,Zhiping Zeng; Anthony KH Tung; Jianyong Wang; Jianhua Feng; Lizhu Zhou,Abstract Graph data have become ubiquitous and manipulating them based on similarity isessential for many applications. Graph edit distance is one of the most widely acceptedmeasures to determine similarities between graphs and has extensive applications in thefields of pattern recognition; computer vision etc. Unfortunately; the problem of graph editdistance computation is NP-Hard in general. Accordingly; in this paper we introduce threenovel methods to compute the upper and lower bounds for the edit distance between twographs in polynomial time. Applying these methods; two algorithms AppFull and AppSub areintroduced to perform different kinds of graph search on graph databases. Comprehensiveexperimental studies are conducted on both real and synthetic datasets to examine variousaspects of the methods for bounding graph edit distance. Result shows that these …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,203
Efficient mining of intertransaction association rules,Anthony K. H.  Tung; Hongjun Lu; Jiawei Han; Ling Feng,Most of the previous studies on mining association rules are on mining intratransactionassociations; ie; the associations among items within the same transaction. We extend thescope to include multidimensional; intertransaction associations. In a database of stock priceinformation; an example of such an association is" if (company) A's stock goes up on dayone; B's stock will go down on day two but go up on day four:" whether we treat company orday as the unit of transaction; the items belong to different transactions. Moreover; such anintertransaction association can be extended to associate multiple properties in the samerule; so that multidimensional intertransaction associations can also be defined anddiscovered. Mining intertransaction associations pose more challenges on efficientprocessing than mining intratransaction associations because the number of potential …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2003,198
Map-join-reduce: Toward scalable and efficient data analysis on large clusters,David Jiang; Anthony KH Tung; Gang Chen,Data analysis is an important functionality in cloud computing which allows a huge amountof data to be processed over very large clusters. MapReduce is recognized as a popularway to handle data in the cloud environment due to its excellent scalability and good faulttolerance. However; compared to parallel databases; the performance of MapReduce isslower when it is adopted to perform complex data analysis tasks that require the joining ofmultiple data sets in order to compute certain aggregates. A common concern is whetherMapReduce can be improved to produce a system with both scalability and efficiency. In thispaper; we introduce Map-Join-Reduce; a system that extends and improves MapReduceruntime framework to efficiently process complex data analysis tasks on large clusters.

Farmer: Finding interesting rule groups in microarray datasets,Gao Cong; Anthony KH Tung; Xin Xu; Feng Pan; Jiong Yang,Abstract Microarray datasets typically contain large number of columns but small number ofrows. Association rules have been proved to be useful in analyzing such datasets. However;most existing association rule mining algorithms are unable to efficiently handle datasetswith large number of columns. Moreover; the number of association rules generated fromsuch datasets is enormous due to the large number of possible column combinations. In thispaper; we describe a new algorithm called FARMER that is specially designed to discoverassociation rules from microarray datasets. Instead of finding individual association rules;FARMER finds interesting rule groups which are essentially a set of rules that are generatedfrom the same set of rows. Unlike conventional rule mining algorithms; FARMER searchesfor interesting rules in the row enumeration space and exploits all user-specified …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,172
Efficient skyline query processing on peer-to-peer networks,Shiyuan Wang; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony KH Tung; Lizhen Xu,Skyline query has been gaining much interest in database research communities in recentyears. Most existing studies focus mainly on centralized systems; and resolving the problemin a distributed environment such as a peer-to-peer (P2P) network is still an emerging topic.The desiderata of efficient skyline querying in P2P environment include: 1) progressivereturning of answers; 2) low processing cost in terms of number of peers accessed andsearch messages; 3) balanced query loads among the peers. In this paper; we propose asolution that satisfies the three desiderata. Our solution is based on a balanced treestructured P2P network. By partitioning the skyline search space adaptively based on queryaccessing patterns; we are able to alleviate the problem of" hot" spots present in the skylinequery processing. By being able to estimate the peer nodes within the query subspaces …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007. IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,167
Spade: On shape-based pattern detection in streaming time series,Yueguo Chen; Mario A Nascimento; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony KH Tung,Monitoring predefined patterns in streaming time series is useful to applications such astrend-related analysis; sensor networks and video surveillance. Most current studies on suchmonitoring employ Euclidean distance to calculate the similarities between given querypatterns and subsequences of streaming time series. Euclidean distance has been shown tobe ineffective in measuring distances of time series in which shifting and scaling usuallyexist. Consequently; warping distances such as dynamic time warping (DTW); longestcommon subsequence (LCSS); have been proposed to handle warps in temporaldimension. However; they are inadequate in handling shifting and scaling in amplitudedimension. Moreover; they have been designed mainly for full sequence matching; whereasin online monitoring applications; we typically have no knowledge on the positions and …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007.

Similarity evaluation on tree-structured data,Rui Yang; Panos Kalnis; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Tree-structured data are becoming ubiquitous nowadays and manipulating thembased on similarity is essential for many applications. The generally accepted similaritymeasure for trees is the edit distance. Although similarity search has been extensivelystudied; searching for similar trees is still an open problem due to the high complexity ofcomputing the tree edit distance. In this paper; we propose to transform tree-structured datainto an approximate numerical multidimensional vector which encodes the original structureinformation. We prove that the L 1 distance of the corresponding vectors; whosecomputational complexity is O (| T 1|+| T 2|); forms a lower bound for the edit distancebetween trees. Based on the theoretical analysis; we describe a novel algorithm whichembeds the proposed distance into a filter-and-refine framework to process similarity …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,157
Mining top-k covering rule groups for gene expression data,Gao Cong; Kian-Lee Tan; Anthony KH Tung; Xin Xu,Abstract In this paper; we propose a novel algorithm to discover the top-k covering rulegroups for each row of gene expression profiles. Several experiments on real bioinformaticsdatasets show that the new top-k covering rule mining algorithm is orders of magnitudefaster than previous association rule mining algorithms. Furthermore; we propose a newclassification method RCBT. RCBT classifier is constructed from the top-k covering rulegroups. The rule groups generated for building RCBT are bounded in number. This is incontrast to existing rule-based classification methods like CBA [19] which despite generatingexcessive number of redundant rules; is still unable to cover some training data with thediscovered rules. Experiments show that the RCBT classifier can match or outperform otherstate-of-the-art classifiers on several benchmark gene expression datasets.

Continuous skyline queries for moving objects,Zhiyong Huang; Hua Lu; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony KH Tung,The literature on skyline algorithms has so far dealt mainly with queries of static query pointsover static data sets. With the increasing number of mobile service applications and users;however; the need for continuous skyline query processing has become more pressing. Acontinuous skyline query involves not only static dimensions; but also the dynamic one. Inthis paper; we examine the spatiotemporal coherence of the problem and propose acontinuous skyline query processing strategy for moving query points. First; we distinguishthe data points that are permanently in the skyline and use them to derive a search bound.Second; we investigate the connection between the spatial positions of data points and theirdominance relationship; which provides an indication of where to find changes in the skylineand how to maintain the skyline continuously. Based on the analysis; we propose a …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2006,144
Dada: a data cube for dominant relationship analysis,Cuiping Li; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony KH Tung; Shan Wang,Abstract The concept of dominance has recently attracted much interest in the context ofskyline computation. Given an N-dimensional data set S; a point p is said to dominate q if pis better than q in at least one dimension and equal to or better than it in the remainingdimensions. In this paper; we propose extending the concept of dominance for businessanalysis from a microeconomic perspective. More specifically; we propose a new form ofanalysis; called Dominant Relationship Analysis (DRA); which aims to provide insight intothe dominant relationships between products and potential buyers. By analyzing suchrelationships; companies can position their products more effectively while remainingprofitable. To support DRA; we propose a novel data cube called DADA (Data Cube forDominant Relationship Analysis); which captures the dominant relationships between …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,143
Locating mapped resources in web 2.0,Dongxiang Zhang; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony KH Tung,Mapping mashups are emerging Web 2.0 applications in which data objects such as blogs;photos and videos from different sources are combined and marked in a map using APIs thatare released by online mapping solutions such as Google and Yahoo Maps. These objectsare typically associated with a set of tags capturing the embedded semantic and a set ofcoordinates indicating their geographical locations. Traditional web resource searchingstrategies are not effective in such an environment due to the lack of the gazetteer context inthe tags. Instead; a better alternative approach is to locate an object by tag matching.However; the number of tags associated with each object is typically small; making it difficultfor an object to capture the complete semantics in the query objects. In this paper; we focuson the fundamental application of locating geographical resources and propose an …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,124
Breaking the barrier of transactions: Mining inter-transaction association rules,Anthony KH Tung; Hongjun Lu; Jiawei Han; Ling Feng,Abstract Most of the previous studies on mining association rules are on mining intro-transaction associations; ie; the associations among items within the same transaction;where the notion of the transaction could be the items bought by the same customer; theevents happened on the same day; etc. In this study; we break the barrier of transactionsand extend the scope of mining association rules from traditional intratransactionassociations to inter-transaction associations. Mining inter-transaction associations posesmore challenges on efficient processing than mining intra-transaction associations becausethe number of potential association rules becomes extremely large after the boundary oftransactions is broken. In this study; we introduce the notion of inter-transaction associationrule; define its measurements: support and confidence; and develop an efficient algorithm …,Proceedings of the fifth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,1999,119
Effective keyword-based selection of relational databases,Bei Yu; Guoliang Li; Karen Sollins; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract The wide popularity of free-and-easy keyword based searches over World WideWeb has fueled the demand for incorporating keyword-based search over structureddatabases. However; most of the current research work focuses on keyword-basedsearching over a single structured data source. With the growing interest in distributeddatabases and service oriented architecture over the Internet; it is important to extend such acapability over multiple structured data sources. One of the most important problems forenabling such a query facility is to be able to select the most useful data sources relevant tothe keyword query. Traditional database summary techniques used for selectingunstructured datasources developed in IR literature are inadequate for our problem; as theydo not capture the structure of the data sources.

Relaxing join and selection queries,Nick Koudas; Chen Li; Anthony KH Tung; Rares Vernica,Abstract Database users can be frustrated by having an empty answer to a query. In thispaper; we propose a framework to systematically relax queries involving joins andselections. When considering relaxing a query condition; intuitively one seeksthe'minimal'amount of relaxation that yields an answer. We first characterize the types ofanswers that we return to relaxed queries. We then propose a lattice based framework inorder to aid query relaxation. Nodes in the lattice correspond to different ways to relaxqueries. We characterize the properties of relaxation at each node and present algorithms tocompute the corresponding answer. We then discuss how to traverse this lattice in a waythat a non-empty query answer is obtained with the minimum amount of query conditionrelaxation. We implemented this framework and we present our results of a thorough …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,108
Fault-Tolerant Frequent Pattern Mining: Problems and Challenges.,Jian Pei; Anthony KH Tung; Jiawei Han,Abstract Real-world data tends to be dirty. Discovering knowledge over large real-world datacalls for fault-tolerant data mining; which is a fruitful direction for future data mining research.Fault-tolerant extensions of data mining techniques would gain useful insights into the data.In this paper; we introduce the problem of faulttolerant frequent pattern mining. With fault-tolerant frequent pattern mining; many kinds of novel; interesting and practically usefulknowledge can be discovered. For example; one can discover the following fault-tolerantassociation rules: 85% of students doing well in three out of the four courses:" datastructure";" algorithm";" artificial intelligence"; and" database"; will receive high grades in"data mining".

Mining frequent closed cubes in 3D datasets,Liping Ji; Kian-Lee Tan; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract In this paper; we introduce the concept of frequent closed cube (FCC); whichgeneralizes the notion of 2D frequent closed pattern to 3D context. We propose two novelalgorithms to mine FCCs from 3D datasets. The first scheme is a Representative SliceMining (RSM) framework that can be used to extend existing 2D FCP mining algorithms forFCC mining. The second technique; called CubeMiner; is a novel algorithm that operates onthe 3D space directly. We have implemented both schemes; and evaluated theirperformance on both real and synthetic datasets. The experimental results show that theRSM-based scheme is efficient when one of the dimensions is small; while CubeMiner issuperior otherwise.,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,80
Skyframe: a framework for skyline query processing in peer-to-peer systems,Shiyuan Wang; Quang Hieu Vu; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony KH Tung; Lizhen Xu,Abstract This paper looks at the processing of skyline queries on peer-to-peer (P2P)networks. We propose Skyframe; a framework for efficient skyline query processing in P2Psystems; which addresses the challenges of quick response time; low networkcommunication cost and query load balancing among peers. Skyframe consists of twoquerying methods: one is optimized for network communication while the other focuses onquery response time. These methods are different in the way in which the query searchspace is defined. In particular; the first method uses a high dominating point that has a largedominating region to prune the search space to achieve a low cost in networkcommunication. On the other hand; the second method relaxes the search space in order toallow parallel query processing to speed up query response. Skyframe achieves query …,The VLDB Journal,2009,79
On triangulation-based dense neighborhood graph discovery,Nan Wang; Jingbo Zhang; Kian-Lee Tan; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract This paper introduces a new definition of dense subgraph pattern; the DN-graph.DN-graph considers both the size of the substructure and the minimum level of interactionsbetween any pair of the vertices. The mining of DN-graphs inherits the difficulty of findingclique; the fully-connected subgraphs. We thus opt for approximately locating the DN-graphsusing the state-of-the-art graph triangulation methods. Our solution consists of a family ofalgorithms; each of which targets a different problem setting. These algorithms are iterative;and utilize repeated scans through the triangles in the graph to approximately locate the DN-graphs. Each scan on the graph triangles improves the results. Since the triangles are notphysically materialized; the algorithms have small memory footprint.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,78
Curler: finding and visualizing nonlinear correlation clusters,Anthony KH Tung; Xin Xu; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract While much work has been done in finding linear correlation among subsets offeatures in high-dimensional data; work on detecting nonlinear correlation has been leftlargely untouched. In this paper; we present an algorithm for finding and visualizingnonlinear correlation clusters in the subspace of high-dimensional databases. Unlike thedetection of linear correlation in which clusters are of unique orientations; finding nonlinearcorrelation clusters of varying orientations requires merging clusters of possibly verydifferent orientations. Combined with the fact that spatial proximity must be judged based ona subset of features that are not originally known; deciding which clusters to be mergedduring the clustering process becomes a challenge. To avoid this problem; we propose anovel concept called co-sharing level which captures both spatial proximity and cluster …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,78
A graph method for keyword-based selection of the top-k databases,Quang Hieu Vu; Beng Chin Ooi; Dimitris Papadias; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract While database management systems offer a comprehensive solution to datastorage; they require deep knowledge of the schema; as well as the data manipulationlanguage; in order to perform effective retrieval. Since these requirements pose a problem tolay or occasional users; several methods incorporate keyword search (KS) into relationaldatabases. However; most of the existing techniques focus on querying a single DBMS. Onthe other hand; the proliferation of distributed databases in several conventional andemerging applications necessitates the support for keyword-based data sharing andquerying over multiple DMBSs. In order to avoid the high cost of searching in numerous;potentially irrelevant; databases in such systems; we propose G-KS; a novel method forselecting the top-K candidates based on their potential to contain results for a given query …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,74
Csv: visualizing and mining cohesive subgraphs,Nan Wang; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Kian-Lee Tan; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Extracting dense sub-components from graphs efficiently is an important objectivein a wide range of application domains ranging from social network analysis to biologicalnetwork analysis; from the World Wide Web to stock market analysis. Motivated by this needrecently we have seen several new algorithms to tackle this problem based on the (frequent)pattern mining paradigm. A limitation of most of these methods is that they are highlysensitive to parameter settings; rely on exhaustive enumeration with exponential timecomplexity; and often fail to help the users understand the underlying distribution ofcomponents embedded within the host graph. In this article we propose an approximatealgorithm; to mine and visualize cohesive subgraphs (dense sub components) within a largegraph.

Scalable top-k spatial keyword search,Dongxiang Zhang; Kian-Lee Tan; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract In this big data era; huge amounts of spatial documents have been generatedeveryday through various location based services. Top-k spatial keyword search is animportant approach to exploring useful information from a spatial database. It retrieves kdocuments based on a ranking function that takes into account both textual relevance(similarity between the query and document keywords) and spatial relevance (distancebetween the query and document locations). Various hybrid indexes have been proposed inrecent years which mainly combine the R-tree and the inverted index so that spatial pruningand textual pruning can be executed simultaneously. However; the rapid growth in datavolume poses significant challenges to existing methods in terms of the index maintenancecost and query processing time. In this paper; we propose a scalable integrated inverted …,Proceedings of the 16th international conference on extending database technology,2013,69
Minimizing the communication cost for continuous skyline maintenance,Zhenjie Zhang; Reynold Cheng; Dimitris Papadias; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Existing work in the skyline literature focuses on optimizing the processing cost.This paper aims at minimization of the communication overhead in client-serverarchitectures; where a server continuously maintains the skyline of dynamic objects. Our firstcontribution is a Filter method that avoids transmission of updates from objects that cannotinfluence the skyline. Specifically; each object is assigned a filter so that it needs to issue anupdate only if it violates its filter. Filter achieves significant savings over the naive approachof transmitting all updates. Going one step further; we introduce the concept of frequentskyline query over a sliding window (FSQW). The motivation is that snapshot skylines arenot very useful in streaming environments because they keep changing over time. Instead;FSQW reports the objects that appear in the skylines of at least θ⋅ s of the s most recent …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,59
Mining frequent closed patterns in microarray data,Gao Cong; Kian-Lee Tan; Anthony KH Tung; Feng Pan,Microarray data typically contains a large number of columns and a small number of rows;which poses a great challenge for existing frequent (closed) pattern mining algorithms thatdiscover patterns in item enumeration space. In this paper; we propose two algorithms thatexplore the row enumeration space to mine frequent closed patterns. Several experimentson real-life gene expression data show that the algorithms are faster than existingalgorithms; including CLOSET; CHARM; CLOSET+ and CARPENTER.,Data Mining; 2004. ICDM'04.

Categorical skylines for streaming data,Nikos Sarkas; Gautam Das; Nick Koudas; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract The problem of skyline computation has attracted considerable research attention.In the categorical domain the problem becomes more complicated; primarily due to thepartially-ordered nature of the attributes of tuples. In this paper; we initiate a study ofstreaming categorical skylines. We identify the limitations of existing work for offlinecategorical skyline computation and realize novel techniques for the problem of maintainingthe skyline of categorical data in a streaming environment. In particular; we develop alightweight data structure for indexing the tuples in the streaming buffer; that can gracefullyadapt to tuples with many attributes and partially ordered domains of any size andcomplexity. Additionally; our study of the dominance relation in the dual space allows us toutilize geometric arrangements in order to index the categorical skyline and efficiently …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,56
Mining shifting-and-scaling co-regulation patterns on gene expression profiles,Xin Xu; Ying Lu; Anthony KH Tung; Wei Wang,In this paper; we propose a new model for coherent clustering of gene expression datacalled reg-cluster. The proposed model allows (1) the expression profiles of genes in acluster to follow any shifting-and-scaling patterns in subspace; where the scaling can beeither positive or negative; and (2) the expression value changes across any two conditionsof the cluster to be significant. No previous work measures up to the task that we have set:the density-based subspace clustering algorithms require genes to have similar expressionlevels to each other in subspace; the pattern-based biclustering algorithms only allow pureshifting or pure scaling patterns; and the tendency-based biclustering algorithms have nocoherence guarantees. We also develop a novel patternbased biclustering algorithm foridentifying shifting-andscaling co-regulation patterns; satisfying both coherence constraint …,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06.

COBBLER: combining column and row enumeration for closed pattern discovery,Feng Pan; Anthony KH Tung; Gao Cong; Xin Xu,The problem of mining frequent closed patterns has received considerable attention recentlyas it promises to have much less redundancy compared to discovering all frequent patterns.Existing algorithms can presently be separated into two groups; feature (column)enumeration and row enumeration. Feature enumeration algorithms like CHARM andCLOSET+ are efficient for datasets with small number of features and large number of rowssince the number of feature combinations to be enumerated is small. Row enumerationalgorithms like CARPENTER on the other hand are more suitable for datasets (eg.bioinformatics data) with large number of features and small number of rows. Both groups ofalgorithms; however; will encounter problem for datasets that have large number of rowsand features. In this paper; we describe a new algorithm called COBBLER which can …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2004. Proceedings. 16th International Conference on,2004,52
An efficient graph indexing method,Xiaoli Wang; Xiaofeng Ding; Anthony KH Tung; Shanshan Ying; Hai Jin,Graphs are popular models for representing complex structure data and similarity search forgraphs has become a fundamental research problem. Many techniques have beenproposed to support similarity search based on the graph edit distance. However; they allsuffer from certain drawbacks: high computational complexity; poor scalability in terms ofdatabase size; or not taking full advantage of indexes. To address these problems; in thispaper; we propose SEGOS; an indexing and query processing framework for graphsimilarity search.

Continuous k-means monitoring over moving objects,Zhenjie Zhang; Yin Yang; Anthony KH Tung; Dimitris Papadias,Given a data set P; a k-means query returns k points in space (called centers); such that theaverage squared distance between each point in P and its nearest center is minimized.Since this problem is NP-hard; several approximate algorithms have been proposed andused in practice. In this paper; we study continuous k-means computation at a server thatmonitors a set of moving objects. Reevaluating k-means every time there is an object updateimposes a heavy burden on the server (for computing the centers from scratch) and theclients (for continuously sending location updates). We overcome these problems with anovel approach that significantly reduces the computation and communication costs; whileguaranteeing that the quality of the solution; with respect to the reevaluation approach; isbounded by a user-defined tolerance. The proposed method assigns each moving object …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2008,51
Itcompress: An iterative semantic compression algorithm,HV Jagadish; Raymond T Ng; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony KH Tung,Real datasets are often large enough to necessitate data compression. Traditional'syntactic'data compression methods treat the table as a large byte string and operate at the byte level.The tradeoff in such cases is usually between the ease of retrieval (the ease with which onecan retrieve a single tuple or attribute value without decompressing a much larger unit) andthe effectiveness of the compression. In this regard; the use of semantic compression hasgenerated considerable interest and motivated certain recent works. We propose a semanticcompression algorithm called ItCompress ITerative Compression; which achieves goodcompression while permitting access even at attribute level without requiring thedecompression of a larger unit. ItCompress iteratively improves the compression ratio of thecompressed output during each scan of the table. The amount of compression can be …,Data Engineering; 2004.

Discovering strong skyline points in high dimensional spaces,Zhenjie Zhang; Xinyu Guo; Hua Lu; Anthony KH Tung; Nan Wang,Abstract Current interests in skyline computation arise due to their relation to preferencequeries. Since it is guaraneed that a skyline point will not lose out in all dimensions whencompared to any other point in the data set; this means that for each skyline point; thereexists a set of weight assignments to the dimensions such that the point will become the topuser preference. We believe that the usefulness of skyline points is not limited to suchapplication and can be extended to data analysis and knowledge discovery as well.However; since the skyline of high dimensional datasets (which are common in dataanalysis applications) can contain too many points; various means must be developed tofilter off the less interesting skyline points in high dimensions. In this paper; we will proposealgorithms to find a set of interesting skyline points called strong skyline points.

Ldc: Enabling search by partial distance in a hyper-dimensional space,Nick Koudas; Beng Chin Ooi; Heng Tao Shen; Anthony KH Tung,Recent advances in research fields like multimedia and bioinformatics have brought about anew generation of hyper-dimensional databases which can contain hundreds or eventhousands of dimensions. Such hyper-dimensional databases pose significant problems toexisting high-dimensional indexing techniques which have been developed for indexingdatabases with (commonly) less than a hundred dimensions. To support efficient queryingand retrieval on hyper-dimensional databases; we propose a methodology called localdigital coding (LDC) which can support k-nearest neighbors (KNN) queries on hyper-dimensional databases and yet co-exist with ubiquitous indices; such as B+-trees. LDCextracts a simple bitmap representation called digital code (DC) for each point in thedatabase. Pruning during KNN search is performed by dynamically selecting only a …,Data Engineering; 2004.

Similarity search: A matching based approach,Anthony KH Tung; Rui Zhang; Nick Koudas; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract Similarity search is a crucial task in multimedia retrieval and data mining. Mostexisting work has modelled this problem as the nearest neighbor (NN) problem; whichconsiders the distance between the query object and the data objects over a fixed set offeatures. Such an approach has two drawbacks: 1) it leaves many partial similaritiesuncovered; 2) the distance is often affected by a few dimensions with high dissimilarity. Toovercome these drawbacks; we propose the kn-match problem in this paper. The kn-matchproblem models similarity search as matching between the query object and the dataobjects in n dimensions; where n is a given integer smaller than dimensionality d and thesen dimensions are determined dynamically to make the query object and the data objectsreturned in the answer set match best. The kn-match query is expected to be superior to …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,49
Scalable clustering using graphics processors,Feng Cao; Anthony KH Tung; Aoying Zhou,Abstract We present new algorithms for scalable clustering using graphics processors. Ourbasic approach is based on k-means. By changing the order of determining object labels;and exploiting the high computational power and pipeline of graphics processing units(GPUs) for distance computing and comparison; we speed up the k-means algorithmsubstantially. We introduce two strategies for retrieving data from the GPU; taking intoaccount the low bandwidth from the GPU back to the main memory. We also extend our GPU-based approach to data stream clustering. We implement our algorithms in a PC with aPentium IV 3.4 G CPU and a NVIDIA GeForce 6800 GT graphics card. Our comprehensiveperformance study shows that the common GPU in desktop computers could be an efficientco-processor of CPU in traditional and data stream clustering.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2006,49
Skyline-join in distributed databases,Dalie Sun; Sai Wu; Jianzhong Li; Anthony KH Tung,The database research community has recently recognized the usefulness of skyline query.As an extension of existing database operator; the skyline query is valuable for multi-criteriadecision making. However; current research tends to assume that the skyline operator isapplied to one table which is not true for many applications on web databases. In webdatabases; tables are distributed in different sites; and a skyline query may involve attributesof multiple tables. In this paper; we address the problem of processing skyline queries onmultiple tables in a distributed environment. We call the new operator skyline-join; as it is ahybrid of skyline and join operations. We propose two efficient approaches to processskyline-join queries which can significantly reduce the communication cost and processingtime. Experiments are conducted and results show that our approaches are efficient for …,Data Engineering Workshop; 2008. ICDEW 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,48
Finding representative set from massive data,Feng Pan; Wei Wang; Anthony KH Tung; Jiong Yang,In the information age; data is pervasive. In some applications; data explosion is a significantphenomenon. The massive data volume poses challenges to both human users andcomputers. In this project; we propose a new model for identifying representative set from alarge database. A representative set is a special subset of the original dataset; which hasthree main characteristics: It is significantly smaller in size compared to the original dataset.It captures the most information from the original dataset compared to other subsets of thesame size. It has low redundancy among the representatives it contains. We use information-theoretic measures such as mutual information and relative entropy to measure therepresentativeness of the representative set. We first design a greedy algorithm and thenpresent a heuristic algorithm that delivers much better performance. We run experiments …,Data Mining; Fifth IEEE International Conference on,2005,44
Similarity search on bregman divergence: Towards non-metric indexing,Zhenjie Zhang; Beng Chin Ooi; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract In this paper; we examine the problem of indexing over non-metric distancefunctions. In particular; we focus on a general class of distance functions; namely BregmanDivergence [6]; to support nearest neighbor and range queries. Distance functions such asKL-divergence and Itakura-Saito distance; are special cases of Bregman divergence; withwide applications in statistics; speech recognition and time series analysis among others.Unlike in metric spaces; key properties such as triangle inequality and distance symmetry donot hold for such distance functions. A direct adaptation of existing indexing infrastructuredeveloped for metric spaces is thus not possible. We devise a novel solution to handle thisclass of distance measures by expanding and mapping points in the original space to a newextended space. Subsequently; we show how state-of-the-art tree-based indexing …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,43
Kernel-based skyline cardinality estimation,Zhenjie Zhang; Yin Yang; Ruichu Cai; Dimitris Papadias; Anthony Tung,Abstract The skyline of a d-dimensional dataset consists of all points not dominated byothers. The incorporation of the skyline operator into practical database systemsnecessitates an efficient and effective cardinality estimation module. However; existingtheoretical work on this problem is limited to the case where all d dimensions areindependent of each other; which rarely holds for real datasets. The state of the art LogSampling (LS) technique simply applies theoretical results for independent dimensions tonon-independent data anyway; sometimes leading to large estimation errors. To solve thisproblem; we propose a novel Kernel-Based (KB) approach that approximates the skylinecardinality with nonparametric methods. Extensive experiments with various real datasetsdemonstrate that KB achieves high accuracy; even in cases where LS fails.

A new approach to dynamic self-tuning of database buffers,Dinh Nguyen Tran; Phung Chinh Huynh; Yong C Tay; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Current businesses rely heavily on efficient access to their databases. Manualtuning of these database systems by performance experts is increasingly infeasible: Forsmall companies; hiring an expert may be too expensive; for large enterprises; even anexpert may not fully understand the interaction between a large system and its multiplechanging workloads. This trend has led major vendors to offer tools that automatically anddynamically tune a database system.,ACM Transactions on Storage (TOS),2008,42
Efficient and effective similarity search over probabilistic data based on earth mover's distance,Jia Xu; Zhenjie Zhang; Anthony KH Tung; Ge Yu,Abstract Probabilistic data is coming as a new deluge along with the technical advances ongeographical tracking; multimedia processing; sensor network and RFID. While similaritysearch is an important functionality supporting the manipulation of probabilistic data; it raisesnew challenges to traditional relational database. The problem stems from the limitedeffectiveness of the distance metric supported by the existing database system. On the otherhand; some complicated distance operators have proven their values for betterdistinguishing ability in the probabilistic domain. In this paper; we discuss the similaritysearch problem with the Earth Mover's Distance; which is the most successful distancemetric on probabilistic histograms and an expensive operator with cubic complexity.

On efficient processing of subspace skyline queries on high dimensional data,Wen Jin; Anthony KH Tung; Martin Ester; Jiawei Han,Recent studies on efficiently answering subspace skyline queries can be separated into twoapproaches. The first focused on pre-materializing a set of skylines points in varioussubspaces while the second focus on dynamically answering the queries by using a set ofanchors to prune off skyline points through spatial reasoning. Despite effort to compress thepre-materialized subspace skylines through removal of redundancy; the storage space forthe first approach remain exponential in the number of dimensions. The query time for thesecond approach on the other hand also grow substantially for data with higherdimensionality where the pruning power of anchors become much weaker. In this paper; wepropose methods for answering subspace skyline query on high dimensional data such thatboth prematerialization storage and query time can be moderated.

Multiple feature fusion for social media applications,Bin Cui; Anthony KH Tung; Ce Zhang; Zhe Zhao,Abstract The emergence of social media as a crucial paradigm has posed new challenges tothe research and industry communities; where media are designed to be disseminatedthrough social interaction. Recent literature has noted the generality of multiple features inthe social media environment; such as textual; visual and user information. However; most ofthe studies employ only a relatively simple mechanism to merge the features rather than fullyexploit feature correlation for social media applications. In this paper; we propose a novelapproach to fusing multiple features and their correlations for similarity evaluation.Specifically; we first build a Feature Interaction Graph (FIG) by taking features as nodes andthe correlations between them as edges. Then; we employ a probabilistic model based onMarkov Random Field to describe the graph for similarity measure between multimedia …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,35
Validating multi-column schema matchings by type,Bing Tian Dai; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava; Anthony KH Tung; Suresh Venkatasubramanian,Validation of multi-column schema matchings is essential for successful databaseintegration. This task is especially difficult when the databases to be integrated contain littleoverlapping data; as is often the case in practice (eg; customer bases of differentcompanies). Based on the intuition that values present in different columns related by aschema matching will have similar" semantic type"; and that this can be captured usingdistributions over values (" statistical types"); we develop a method for validating 1-1 andcompositional schema matchings. Our technique is based on three key technical ideas. First;we propose a generic measure for comparing two columns matched by a schema matching;based on a notion of information-theoretic discrepancy that generalizes the standardgeometric discrepancy; this provides the basis for 1: 1 matching. Second; we present an …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008. IEEE 24th International Conference on,2008,35
Indexing DNA sequences using q-grams,Xia Cao; Shuai Cheng Li; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract We have observed in recent years a growing interest in similarity search on largecollections of biological sequences. Contributing to the interest; this paper presents amethod for indexing the DNA sequences efficiently based on q-grams to facilitate similaritysearch in a DNA database and sidestep the need for linear scan of the entire database. Twolevel index–hash table and c-trees–are proposed based on the q-grams of DNA sequences.The proposed data structures allow the quick detection of sequences within a certaindistance to the query sequence. Experimental results show that our method is efficient indetecting similarity regions in a DNA sequence database with high sensitivity.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2005,35
On dominating your neighborhood profitably,Cuiping Li; Anthony KH Tung; Wen Jin; Martin Ester,Abstract Recent research on skyline queries has attracted much interest in the database anddata mining community. Given a database; an object belongs to the skyline if it cannot bedominated with respect to the given attributes by any other database object. Currentmethods have only considered so-called min/max attributes like price and quality which auser wants to minimize or maximize. However; objects can also have spatial attributes like x;y coordinates which can be used to represent relevant constraints on the query results. Inthis paper; we introduce novel skyline query types taking into account not only min/maxattributes but also spatial attributes and the relationships between these different attributetypes. Such queries support a micro-economic approach to decision making; consideringnot only the quality but also the cost of solutions. We investigate two alternative …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,33
Large scale cohesive subgraphs discovery for social network visual analysis,Feng Zhao; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Graphs are widely used in large scale social network analysis nowadays. Not onlyanalysts need to focus on cohesive subgraphs to study patterns among social actors; butalso normal users are interested in discovering what happening in their neighborhood.However; effectively storing large scale social network and efficiently identifying cohesivesubgraphs is challenging. In this work we introduce a novel subgraph concept to capture thecohesion in social interactions; and propose an I/O efficient approach to discover cohesivesubgraphs. Besides; we propose an analytic system which allows users to perform intuitive;visual browsing on large scale social networks. Our system stores the network as a socialgraph in the graph database; retrieves a local cohesive subgraph based on the inputkeywords; and then hierarchically visualizes the subgraph out on orbital layout; in which …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,32
The ed-tree: an index for large dna sequence databases,Zhenqiang Tan; Xia Cao; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony KH Tung,The growing interest in genomic research has caused an explosive growth in the size ofDNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) databases making it increasingly challenging to performsearches on them. In this paper; we proposed an index structure called the ed-tree forsupporting fast and effective homology searches on DNA databases. The ed-tree isdeveloped to enable probe-based homology search algorithms like Blastn which generateshort probe strings from the query sequence and then match them against the sequencedatabase in order to identify potential regions of high similarity to the query sequence.Unlike Blastn however; the homology search algorithm we developed for ed-tree supportsmore flexible probe model with longer probes and more relaxed matching. As aconsequence; the ed-tree is not only more effective and efficient than the latest Blastn …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2003. 15th International Conference on,2003,31
On domination game analysis for microeconomic data mining,Zhenjie Zhang; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Game theory is a powerful tool for analyzing the competitions among manufacturersin a market. In this article; we present a study on combining game theory and data mining byintroducing the concept of domination game analysis. We present a multidimensional marketmodel; where every dimension represents one attribute of a commodity. Every product orcustomer is represented by a point in the multidimensional space; and a product is said to“dominate” a customer if all of its attributes can satisfy the requirements of the customer. Theexpected market share of a product is measured by the expected number of the buyers inthe customers; all of which are equally likely to buy any product dominating him. A Nashequilibrium is a configuration of the products achieving stable expected market shares for allproducts. We prove that Nash equilibrium in such a model can be computed in …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2009,30

Efficient and scalable processing of string similarity join,Chuitian Rong; Wei Lu; Xiaoli Wang; Xiaoyong Du; Yueguo Chen; Anthony KH Tung,The string similarity join is a basic operation of many applications that need to find all stringpairs from a collection given a similarity function and a user-specified threshold. Recently;there has been considerable interest in designing new algorithms with the assistant of aninverted index to support efficient string similarity joins. These algorithms typically adopt atwo-step filter-and-refine approach in identifying similar string pairs: 1) generating candidatepairs by traversing the inverted index; and 2) verifying the candidate pairs by computing thesimilarity. However; these algorithms either suffer from poor filtering power (which results inhigh verification cost); or incur too much computational cost to guarantee the filtering power.In this paper; we propose a multiple prefix filtering method based on different globalorderings such that the number of candidate pairs can be reduced significantly.

Automatic itinerary planning for traveling services,Gang Chen; Sai Wu; Jingbo Zhou; Anthony KH Tung,Creating an efficient and economic trip plan is the most annoying job for a backpack traveler.Although travel agency can provide some predefined itineraries; they are not tailored foreach specific customer. Previous efforts address the problem by providing an automaticitinerary planning service; which organizes the points-of-interests (POIs) into a customizeditinerary. Because the search space of all possible itineraries is too costly to fully explore; tosimplify the complexity; most work assume that user's trip is limited to some important POIsand will complete within one day. To address the above limitation; in this paper; we design amore general itinerary planning service; which generates multiday itineraries for the users.In our service; all POIs are considered and ranked based on the users' preference. Theproblem of searching the optimal itinerary is a team orienteering problem (TOP); a well …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2014,26
What is unequal among the equals? Ranking equivalent rules from gene expression data,Ruichu Cai; Anthony KH Tung; Zhenjie Zhang; Zhifeng Hao,In previous studies; association rules have been proven to be useful in classificationproblems over high dimensional gene expression data. However; due to the nature of suchdata sets; it is often the case that millions of rules can be derived such that many of them arecovered by exactly the same set of training tuples and thus have exactly the same supportand confidence. Ranking and selecting useful rules from such equivalent rule groups remainan interesting and unexplored problem. In this paper; we look at two interestingnessmeasures for ranking the interestingness of rules within equivalent rule group: Max-Subrule-Conf and Min-Subrule-Conf. Based on these interestingness measures; an incrementalApriori-like algorithm is designed to select more interesting rules from the lower bound rulesof the group. Moreover; we present an improved classification model to fully exploit the …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2011,26
Incremental maintenance of quotient cube for median,Cuiping Li; Gao Cong; Anthony KH Tung; Shan Wang,Abstract Data cube pre-computation is an important concept for supporting OLAP (OnlineAnalytical Processing) and has been studied extensively. It is often not feasible to compute acomplete data cube due to the huge storage requirement. Recently proposed quotient cubeaddressed this issue through a partitioning method that groups cube cells into equivalencepartitions. Such an approach is not only useful for distributive aggregate functions such asSUM but can also be applied to the holistic aggregate functions like MEDIAN. Maintaining adata cube for holistic aggregation is a hard problem since its difficulty lies in the fact thathistory tuple values must be kept in order to compute the new aggregate when tuples areinserted or deleted. The quotient cube makes the problem harder since we also need tomaintain the equivalence classes. In this paper; we introduce two techniques called …,Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2004,26
A “semi-lazy” approach to probabilistic path prediction in dynamic environments,Jingbo Zhou; Anthony KH Tung; Wei Wu; Wee Siong Ng,Abstract Path prediction is useful in a wide range of applications. Most of the existingsolutions; however; are based on eager learning methods where models and patterns areextracted from historical trajectories and then used for future prediction. Since suchapproaches are committed to a set of statistically significant models or patterns; problemscan arise in dynamic environments where the underlying models change quickly or wherethe regions are not covered with statistically significant models or patterns. We propose a"semi-lazy" approach to path prediction that builds prediction models on the fly usingdynamically selected reference trajectories. Such an approach has several advantages.First; the target trajectories to be predicted are known before the models are built; whichallows us to construct models that are deemed relevant to the target trajectories.

A fast filter for obstructed nearest neighbor queries,Chenyi Xia; David Hsu; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract In this paper; we study the Obstructed Nearest Neighbor (ONN) problem: given aset of points and a set of polygonal obstacles in two dimensions; find the k nearestneighbors to a query point according to the length of the shortest obstacle-avoiding pathbetween two points. ONN query is useful both as a stand-alone tool in geographicalinformation systems and as a primitive for spatial data analysis such as clustering andclassification in the presence of obstacles. We propose an efficient ONN algorithm thatprocesses only the data points and obstacles relevant to the query in an incremental wayand thus filters out a large number of points and obstacles. Experiments on spatial data setsshow the algorithm scales well with respect to the input data size and the number of nearestneighbors requested.,British National Conference on Databases,2004,25
Estimating local optimums in EM algorithm over Gaussian mixture model,Zhenjie Zhang; Bing Tian Dai; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract EM algorithm is a very popular iteration-based method to estimate the parametersof Gaussian Mixture Model from a large observation set. However; in most cases; EMalgorithm is not guaranteed to converge to the global optimum. Instead; it stops at somelocal optimums; which can be much worse than the global optimum. Therefore; it is usuallyrequired to run multiple procedures of EM algorithm with different initial configurations andreturn the best solution. To improve the efficiency of this scheme; we propose a new methodwhich can estimate an upper bound on the logarithm likelihood of the local optimum; basedon the current configuration after the latest EM iteration. This is accomplished by firstderiving some region bounding the possible locations of local optimum; followed by someupper bound estimation on the maximum likelihood. With this estimation; we can …,Proceedings of the 25th international conference on Machine learning,2008,24
COE: Clustering with Obstacles Entities A Preliminary Study,Anthony KH Tung; Jean Hou; Jiawei Han,Abstract Clustering analysis has been a very active area of research in the data miningcommunity. However; most algorithms have ignored the fact that physical obstacles exist inthe real world and could thus affect the result of clustering dramatically. In this paper; we willlook at the problem of clustering in the presence of obstacles. We called this problem theCOE (Clustering with Obstacles Entities) problem and provide an outline of an algorithmcalled COE-CLARANS to solve it.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2000,24
Understanding the meaning of a shifted sky: a general framework on extending skyline query,Zhenjie Zhang; Hua Lu; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony K Tung,Abstract Skyline queries are often used on data sets in multi-dimensional space for manydecision-making applications. Traditionally; an object p is said to dominate another object qif; for all dimensions; it is no worse than q and is better on at least one dimension. Therefore;the skyline of a data set consists of all objects not dominated by any other object. To bettercater to application requirements such as controlling the size of the skyline or handling datasets that are not well-structured; various works have been proposed to extend the definitionof skyline based on variants of the dominance relationship. In view of the proliferation ofvariants; in this paper; a generalized framework is proposed to guide the extension ofskyline query from conventional definition to different variants. Our framework explicitly andcarefully examines the various properties that should be preserved in a variant of the …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2010,23
Indexing mixed types for approximate retrieval,Liang Jin; Chen Li; Nick Koudas; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract In various applications such as data cleansing; being able to retrieve categorical ornumerical attributes based on notions of approximate match (eg; edit distance; numericaldistance) is of profound importance. Commonly; approximate match predicates are specifiedon combinations of attributes in conjunction. Existing database techniques for approximateretrieval; however; limit their applicability to single attribute retrieval through B-trees andtheir variants. In this paper; we propose a methodology that utilizes known multidimensionalindexing structures for the problem of approximate multi-attribute retrieval. Our methodenables indexing of a collection of string and/or numeric attributes to facilitate approximateretrieval using edit distance as an approximate match predicate for strings and numericdistance for numeric attributes.

K-anonymity for crowdsourcing database,Sai Wu; Xiaoli Wang; Sheng Wang; Zhenjie Zhang; Anthony KH Tung,In crowdsourcing database; human operators are embedded into the database engine andcollaborate with other conventional database operators to process the queries. Each humanoperator publishes small HITs (Human Intelligent Task) to the crowdsourcing platform; whichconsists of a set of database records and corresponding questions for human workers. Thehuman workers complete the HITs and return the results to the crowdsourcing database forfurther processing. In practice; published records in HITs may contain sensitive attributes;probably causing privacy leakage so that malicious workers could link them with other publicdatabases to reveal individual private information. Conventional privacy protectiontechniques; such as K-Anonymity; can be applied to partially solve the problem.

Hashfile: An efficient index structure for multimedia data,Dongxiang Zhang; Divyakant Agrawal; Gang Chen; Anthony KH Tung,Nearest neighbor (NN) search in high dimensional space is an essential query in manymultimedia retrieval applications. Due to the curse of dimensionality; existing indexstructures might perform even worse than a simple sequential scan of data when answeringexact NN query. To improve the efficiency of NN search; locality sensitive hashing (LSH) andits variants have been proposed to find approximate NN. They adopt hash functions that canpreserve the Euclidean distance so that similar objects have a high probability of colliding inthe same bucket. Given a query object; candidate for the query result is obtained byaccessing the points that are located in the same bucket. To improve the precision; eachhash table is associated with m hash functions to recursively hash the data points intosmaller buckets and remove the false positives.

Finding time-lagged 3D clusters,Xin Xu; Ying Lu; Kian-Lee Tan; Anthony KH Tung,Existing 3D clustering algorithms on gene× sample× time expression data do not considerthe time lags between correlated gene expression patterns. Besides; they either ignore thecorrelation on time subseries; or disregard the continuity of the time series; or only validatepure shifting or pure scaling coherent patterns instead of the general shifting and-scalingpatterns. In this paper; we propose a novel 3D cluster model; S2D3 Cluster; to address theseproblems; where S2 reflects the shifting-and-scaling correlation and D3 the 3-Dimensionalgene× sample× time data. Within the S2D3 Cluster model; expression levels of genes areshifting-and-scaling coherent in both sample subspace and time subseries with arbitrarytime lags.

Compressed hierarchical mining of frequent closed patterns from dense data sets,Liping Ji; Kian-Lee Tan; Anthony Tung,This paper addresses the problem of finding frequent closed patterns (FCPs) from verydense data sets. We introduce two compressed hierarchical FCP mining algorithms: C-Minerand B-Miner. The two algorithms compress the original mining space; hierarchically partitionthe whole mining task into independent subtasks; and mine each subtask progressively. Thetwo algorithms adopt different task partitioning strategies: C-Miner partitions the mining taskbased on Compact Matrix Division; whereas B-Miner partitions the task based on BaseRows Projection. The compressed hierarchical mining algorithms enhance the miningefficiency and facilitate a progressive refinement of results. Moreover; because the subtaskscan be mined independently; C-Miner and B-Miner can be readily paralleled withoutincurring significant communication overhead.

In our model; only certain segments inthe databases called'piers' need to be accessed during searches as opposite to otherapproaches which require a full scan on the biological sequence database. To furtherimprove the search efficiency; the piers are stored in a specially designed hash table whichhelps to avoid expensive alignment operation. The has table is small enough to reside inmain memory; hence avoiding I/O in the search steps. We show theoretically and empiricallythat the proposed approach can efficiently detect biological sequences that are similar to aquery sequence with very high sensitivity.,ACM Sigmod Record,2004,19
Efficiently extracting frequent subgraphs using mapreduce,Wei Lu; Gang Chen; Anthony KH Tung; Feng Zhao,Frequent subgraph extraction from a large number of small graphs is a primitive operationfor many data mining applications. To extract frequent subgraphs; existing techniques needto enumerate a large number of subgraphs which is superlinear with the cardinality of thedataset. Given the rapid growing volume of graph data; it is difficult to perform the frequentsubgraph extraction on a centralized machine efficiently. In this paper; we investigate how toefficiently perform this extraction over very large datasets using MapReduce. Parallelizingexisting techniques directly using MapReduce does not yield good performance as it isdifficult to balance the workload among the compute nodes. We therefore propose aframework that adopts the breadth first search strategy to iteratively extract frequentsubgraphs; ie; all frequent size-(i+ 1) subgraphs are generated based on frequent size-i …,Big Data; 2013 IEEE International Conference on,2013,18
Call to order: a hierarchical browsing approach to eliciting users' preference,Feng Zhao; Gautam Das; Kian-Lee Tan; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Computing preference queries has received a lot of attention in the databasecommunity. It is common that the user is unsure of his/her preference; so care must be takento elicit the preference of the user correctly. In this paper; we propose to elicit the preferredordering of a user by utilizing skyline objects as the representatives of the possible ordering.We introduce the notion of order-based representative skylines which selectsrepresentatives based on the orderings that they represent. To further facilitate preferenceexploration; a hierarchical clustering algorithm is applied to compute a denogram on theskyline objects. By coupling the hierarchical clustering with visualization techniques; weallow users to refine their preference weight settings by browsing the hierarchy. Extensiveexperiments were conducted and the results validate the feasibility and the efficiency of …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,18
Discovering Web usage patterns by mining cross-transaction association rules,Jian Chen; Jian Yin; Anthony KH Tung; Bin Liu,Web usage mining is the application of data mining techniques to large Web log databasesin order to extract usage patterns. However; most of the previous studies on usage patternsdiscovery just focus on mining intra-transaction associations; ie; the associations amongitems within the same user transaction. A cross-transaction association rule describes theassociation relationships among different user transactions. In this paper; the closureproperty of frequent itemsets is used to mining cross-transaction association rules from Weblog databases. An approach and algorithmic framework beads on it is designed andanalyzed.,Machine Learning and Cybernetics; 2004. Proceedings of 2004 International Conference on,2004,18
A general framework of hierarchical clustering and its applications,Ruichu Cai; Zhenjie Zhang; Anthony KH Tung; Chenyun Dai; Zhifeng Hao,Abstract Hierarchical clustering problem is a traditional topic in computer science; whichaims to discover a consistent hierarchy of clusters with different granularities. One of themost important open questions on hierarchical clustering is the identification of themeaningful clustering levels in the hierarchical structure. In this paper; we answer thisquestion from algorithmic point of view. In particular; we derive a quantitative analysis on theimpact of the low-level clustering costs on high level clusters; when agglomerativealgorithms are run to construct the hierarchy. This analysis enables us to find meaningfulclustering levels; which are independent of the clusters hierarchically beneath it. We thuspropose a general agglomerative hierarchical clustering framework; which automaticallyconstructs meaningful clustering levels. This framework is proven to be generally …,Information Sciences,2014,17
Efficient and effective similarity search over probabilistic data based on earth mover’s distance,Jia Xu; Zhenjie Zhang; Anthony KH Tung; Ge Yu,Abstract Advances in geographical tracking; multimedia processing; information extraction;and sensor networks have created a deluge of probabilistic data. While similarity search isan important tool to support the manipulation of probabilistic data; it raises new challengesto traditional relational databases. The problem stems from the limited effectiveness of thedistance metrics employed by existing database systems. On the other hand; several morecomplicated distance operators have proven their values for better distinguishing ability inspecific probabilistic domains. In this paper; we discuss the similarity search problem withrespect to Earth Mover's Distance (EMD). EMD is the most successful distance metric forprobability distribution comparison but is an expensive operator as it has cubic timecomplexity. We present a new database indexing approach to answer EMD-based …,The VLDB Journal,2012,17
Discovering spatial interaction patterns,Chang Sheng; Wynne Hsu; Mong Li Lee; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Advances in sensing and satellite technologies and the growth of Internet haveresulted in the easy accessibility of vast amount of spatial data. Extracting useful knowledgefrom these data is an important and challenging task; in particular; finding interaction amongspatial features. Existing works typically adopt a grid-like approach to transform thecontinuous spatial space to a discrete space. In this paper; we propose to model the spatialfeatures in a continuous space through the use of influence functions. For each feature type;we build an influence map that captures the distribution of the feature instances.Superimposing the influence maps allows the interaction of the feature types to be quicklydetermined. Experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets indicate that theproposed approach is scalable and is able to discover patterns that have been missed by …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2008,17
Go green: recycle and reuse frequent patterns,Gao Cong; Beng Chin Ooi; K-L Tan; Anthony KH Tung,In constrained data mining; users can specify constraints to prune the search space to avoidmining uninteresting knowledge. This is typically done by specifying some initial values ofthe constraints that are subsequently refined iteratively until satisfactory results are obtained.Existing mining schemes treat each iteration as a distinct mining process; and fail to exploitthe information generated between iterations. We propose to salvage knowledge that isdiscovered from an earlier iteration of mining to enhance subsequent rounds of mining. Inparticular; we look at how frequent patterns can be recycled. Our proposed strategy operatesin two phases. In the first phase; frequent patterns obtained from an early iteration are usedto compress a database. In the second phase; subsequent mining processes operate on thecompressed database. We propose two compression strategies and adapt three existing …,Data Engineering; 2004.

Geo-spatial Clustering with User-Specified Constraints,Anthony KH Tung; Raymond T Ng; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Capturing application semantics and allowing a human analyst to express his focusin mining have been the motivation for several recent studies on constrained mining. In thispaper; we introduce and study the problem of constrained clustering—finding clusters thatsatisfy certain user-specified constraints. We argue that this problem arises naturally inpractice. Two types of constraints are discussed in this paper. The first type of constraints areimposed by physical obstacles that exist in the region of clustering. The second type ofconstraints are SQL constraints which every cluster must satisfy. We provide a prelimaryintroduction to both types of constraints and discuss some techniques for solving them.,Proceedings of the First International Conference on Multimedia Data Mining,2000,17
Mining outliers in spatial networks,Wen Jin; Yuelong Jiang; Weining Qian; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Outlier analysis is an important task in data mining and has attracted much attentionin both research and applications. Previous work on outlier detection involves different typesof databases such as spatial databases; time series databases; biomedical databases; etc.However; few of the existing studies have considered spatial networks where points resideon every edge. In this paper; we study the interesting problem of distance-based outliers inspatial networks. We propose an efficient mining method which partitions each edge of aspatial network into a set of length d segments; then quickly identifies the outliers in theremaining edges after pruning those unnecessary edges which cannot contain outliers. Wealso present algorithms that can be applied when the spatial network is updating points orthe input parameters of outlier measures are changed.

Smiler: A semi-lazy time series prediction system for sensors,Jingbo Zhou; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract It is useful to predict future values in time series data; for example when there aremany sensors monitoring environments such as urban space. The Gaussian Process (GP)model is considered as a promising technique for this setting. However; the GP modelrequires too high a training cost to be tractable for large data. Though approximationmethods have been proposed to improve GP's scalability; they usually can only captureglobal trends in the data and fail to preserve small-scale patterns; resulting in unsatisfactoryperformance.,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,14
Efficient and effective knn sequence search with approximate n-grams,Xiaoli Wang; Xiaofeng Ding; Anthony KH Tung; Zhenjie Zhang,Abstract In this paper; we address the problem of finding k-nearest neighbors (KNN) insequence databases using the edit distance. Unlike most existing works using short andexact n-gram matchings together with a filter-and-refine framework for KNN sequencesearch; our new approach allows us to use longer but approximate n-gram matchings as abasis of KNN candidates pruning. Based on this new idea; we devise a pipeline frameworkover a two-level index for searching KNN in the sequence database. By coupling thisframework together with several efficient filtering strategies; ie the frequency queue and thewell-known Combined Algorithm (CA); our proposal brings various enticing advantages overexisting works; including 1) huge reduction on false positive candidates to avoid largeoverheads on candidate verifications; 2) progressive result update and early termination; …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,14
On the lower bound of local optimums in k-means algorithm,Zhenjie Zhang; Bing Tian Dai; Anthony KH Tung,The k-means algorithm is a popular clustering method used in many different fields ofcomputer science; such as data mining; machine learning and information retrieval.However; the k-means algorithm is very likely to converge to some local optimum which ismuch worse than the desired global optimal solution. To overcome this problem; current k-means algorithm and its variants usually run many times with different initial centers to avoidbeing trapped in local optimums that are of unacceptable quality. In this paper; we proposean efficient method to compute a lower bound on the cost of the local optimum from thecurrent center set. After every k-means iteration; k-means algorithm can halt the procedure ifthe lower bound of the cost at the future local optimum is worse than the best solution thathas already been computed so far. Although such a lower bound computation incurs …,Data Mining; 2006. ICDM'06. Sixth International Conference on,2006,14

Data mining techniques for the practical bioinformatician,Jinyan Li; Huiqing Liu; Anthony Tung; Limsoon Wong,Abstract The use of computing to organize; manage; and analyse biological and clinical datahas become an important element of biology and medical research. In the 1990s; largequantities of DNA sequence data were generated by the Human Genome Project and othergenome sequencing efforts. Computing projects in algorithms; software; and databaseswere crucial in the automated assembly and analysis of the genomic data. In the 2000s; weenter the so-called post-genome era. Many genomes have already been completelysequenced. Genome research migrates from raw data generation into scientific knowledgediscovery.

Cross domain search by exploiting wikipedia,Chen Liu; Sai Wu; Shouxu Jiang; Anthony KH Tung,The abundance of Web 2.0 resources in various media formats calls for better resourceintegration to enrich user experience. This naturally leads to a new cross-modal resourcesearch requirement; in which a query is a resource in one modal and the results are closelyrelated resources in other modalities. With cross-modal search; we can better exploitexisting resources. Tags associated with Web 2.0 resources are intuitive medium to linkresources with different modality together. However; tagging is by nature an ad hoc activity.They often contain noises and are affected by the subjective inclination of the tagger.Consequently; linking resources simply by tags will not be reliable. In this paper; we proposean approach for linking tagged resources to concepts extracted from Wikipedia; which hasbecome a fairly reliable reference over the last few years. Compared to the tags; the …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,12
Broad: Diversified keyword search in databases,Feng Zhao; Xiaolong Zhang; Anthony KH Tung; Gang Chen,Keyword search in databases has received a lot of attention in the database community as itis an effective approach for querying a database without knowing its underlying schema.However; keyword search queries often return too many results. One standard solution is torank results such that the “best” results appear first. Still; this approach can suffer fromredundancy problem where many high ranking results are in fact coming from the same partof the database and results in other parts of the database are missed completely. In thispaper; we propose the BROAD system which allows users to perform diverse; hierarchicalbrowsing on keyword search results. Our system partitions the answer trees in the keywordsearch results by selecting k diverse representatives from the trees; separating the answertrees into k groups based on their similarity to the representatives and then recursively …,*,2011,12
Sense the physical; walkthrough the virtual; manage the co (existing) spaces: a database perspective,Beng Chin Ooi; Kian Lee Tan; Anthony Tung,Abstract In a co-space environment; the physical space and the virtual space co-exist; andinteract simultaneously. While the physical space is virtually enhanced with information; thevirtual space is continuously refreshed with real-time; real-world information. To allow usersto process and manipulate information seamlessly between the real and digital spaces;novel technologies must be developed. These include smart interfaces; new augmentedrealities; efficient storage and data management and dissemination techniques. In thispaper; we first discuss some promising co-space applications. These applications offerexperiences and opportunities that neither of the spaces can realize on its own. We thenargue that the database community has much to offer to this field. Finally; we present severalchallenges that we; as a community; can contribute towards managing the co-space.,ACM SIGMOD Record,2010,12
BROOM: buffer replacement using online optimization by mining,Anthony KH Tung; YC Tay; Hongjun Lu,Abstract Buffer replacement is a classic research problem in database management. It hasbeen extensively studied; and new strategies continue to be proposed. While existingstrategies (eg LRU; LFU) use heuristics to determine which page to replace when there is apage fault; this paper presents a different approach; called BROOM; that is based on twoideas: for robust perfor-mance (eg regardless of buffer size); the replacement policy must(1)“know” something about the patterns of page references; and (2) imitate the optimumoffline policy. BROOM requires that historical reference streams be mined periodically toextract knowledge about current patterns in page access. It then uses this knowledge foronline buffer replacement by imitating the optimum strategy. Simulation results arepresented to show that BROOM sometimes has the best hit rates; but seldom the worst …,Proceedings of the seventh international conference on Information and knowledge management,1998,12
Contextual crowd intelligence,Beng Chin Ooi; Kian Lee Tan; Quoc Trung Tran; James WL Yip; Gang Chen; Zheng Jye Ling; Thi Nguyen; Anthony KH Tung; Meihui Zhang,Abstract Most data analytics applications are industry/domain specific; eg; predictingpatients at high risk of being admitted to intensive care unit in the healthcare sector orpredicting malicious SMSs in the telecommunication sector. Existing solutions are based on"best practices"; ie; the systems' decisions are knowledge-driven and/or data-driven.However; there are rules and exceptional cases that can only be precisely formulated andidentified by subject-matter experts (SMEs) who have accumulated many years ofexperience.

DSIM: A distance-based indexing method for genomic sequences,Xia Cao; Beng Chin Ooi; AKH Tung; Hwee Hwa Pang,In this paper; we propose a Distance-based Sequence Indexing Method (DSIM) for indexingand searching genome databases. Borrowing the idea of video compression; we compressthe genomic sequence database around a set of automatically selected reference words;formed from high-frequency data substrings and substrings in past queries. Thecompression captures the distance of each non-reference word in the database to somereference word. At runtime; a query is processed by comparing its substrings with thecompressed data strings; through their distances to the reference words. We also proposean efficient scheme to incrementally update the reference words and the compressed datasequences as more data sequences are added and new queries come along.

Semantic mining and analysis of gene expression data,Xin Xu; Gao Cong; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Association rules can reveal biological relevant relationship between genes andenvironments/categories. However; most existing association rule mining algorithms arerendered impractical on gene expression data; which typically contains thousands or tens ofthousands of columns (gene expression levels); but only tens of rows (samples). The mainproblem is that these algorithms have an exponential dependence on the number ofcolumns. Another shortcoming is evident that too many associations are generated fromsuch kind of data. To this end; we have developed a novel depth-first row-wise algorithmFARMER [2] that is specially designed to efficiently discover and cluster association rulesinto interesting rule groups (IRGs) that satisfy user-specified minimum support; confidenceand chi-square value thresholds on biological datasets as opposed to finding association …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,10
Incremental maintenance of quotient cube based on galois lattice,Cui-Ping Li; Kum-Hoe Tung; Shan Wang,Abstract Data cube computation is a well-known expensive operation and has been studiedextensively. It is often not feasible to compute a complete data cube due to the huge storagerequirement. Recently proposed quotient cube addressed this fundamental issue through apartitioning method that groups cube cells into equivalent partitions. The effectiveness andefficiency of the quotient cube for cube compression and computation have been proved.However; as changes are made to the data sources; to maintain such a quotient cube is non-trivial since the equivalent classes in it must be split or merged. In this paper; incrementalalgorithms are designed to update existing quotient cube efficiently based on Galois lattice.Performance study shows that these algorithms are efficient and scalable for largedatabases.,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2004,10
ARCS: an aggregated related column scoring scheme for aligned sequences,Bin Song; Jeong-Hyeon Choi; Guangyu Chen; Jacek Szymanski; Guo-Qiang Zhang; Anthony KH Tung; Jaewoo Kang; Sun Kim; Jiong Yang,Abstract Motivation: Biologists frequently align multiple biological sequences to determineconsensus sequences and/or search for predominant residues and conserved regions.Particularly; determining conserved regions in an alignment is one of the most importantactivities. Since protein sequences are often several-hundred residues or longer; it is difficultto distinguish biologically important conserved regions (motifs or domains) from others. Thewidely used tools; Logos; Al2co; Confind; and the entropy-based method; often fail tohighlight such regions. Thus a computational tool that can highlight biologically importantregions accurately will be highly desired.

Querying complex spatio-temporal sequences in human motion databases,Yueguo Chen; Shouxu Jiang; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony KH Tung,Content-based retrieval of spatio-temporal patterns from human motion databases isinherently nontrivial since finding effective distance measures for such data is difficult. Thesedata are typically modelled as time series of high dimensional vectors which incur expensivestorage and retrieval cost as a result of the high dimensionality. In this paper; we abstractsuch complex spatio-temporal data as a set of frames which are then represented as highdimensional categorical feature vectors. New distance measures and queries for highdimensional categorical time series are then proposed and efficient query processingtechniques for answering these queries are developed. We conducted experiments usingour proposed distance measures and queries on human motion capture databases.

Substructure clustering on sequential 3D object datasets,Zhenqiang Tan; Anthony KH Tung,We look at substructure clustering of sequential 3d objects. A sequential 3d object is a set ofpoints located in a three dimensional space that are linked up to form a sequence. Given aset of sequential 3d objects; our aim is to find significantly large substructures which arepresent in many of the sequential 3d objects. Unlike traditional subspace clustering methodsin which objects are compared based on values in the same dimension; the matchingdimensions between two 3d sequential objects are affected by both the translation androtation of the objects and are thus not well defined. Instead; similarity between the objectsare judge by computing a structural distance measurement call rmsd (Root Mean SquareDistance) which require proper alignment (including translation and rotation) of the objects.As the computation of rmsd is expensive; we proposed a new measure call ald (Angle …,Data Engineering; 2004.

Based on the prediction; we then transform the feature space based on theuser's feedback and employ an Expectation Maximization (EM) approach to simulate thenew space by a mixture of Gaussian distributions.

Interactive hierarchical tag clouds for summarizing spatiotemporal social contents,Wei Kang; Anthony KH Tung; Feng Zhao; Xinyu Li,In recent years; much effort has been invested in analyzing social network data. However; itremains a great challenge to support interactive exploration of such huge amounts of data.In this paper; we propose Vesta; a system that enables visual exploration of social networkdata via tag clouds. Under Vesta; users can interactively explore and extract summaries ofsocial network contents published in a certain spatial region during a certain period of time.These summaries are represented using a novel concept called hierarchical tag clouds;which allows users to zoom in/out to explore more specific/general tag summaries. In Vesta;the spatiotemporal data is split into partitions.

Automaticexchange pairing is increasingly demanding in such community systems; and potentiallyleading to new business opportunities. To meet the needs on item exchange in the market;each user in the system is entitled to list some items he/she no longer needs; as well assome required items he/she is seeking for. Given the values of all items; an exchangebetween two users is eligible if 1) they both have some unneeded items the other one wants;and 2) the exchange items from both sides are approximately of the same total value.

EasySVM: A visual analysis approach for open-box support vector machines,Yuxin Ma; Wei Chen; Xiaohong Ma; Jiayi Xu; Xinxin Huang; Ross Maciejewski; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Support vector machines (SVMs) are supervised learning models traditionallyemployed for classification and regression analysis. In classification analysis; a set oftraining data is chosen; and each instance in the training data is assigned a categoricalclass. An SVM then constructs a model based on a separating plane that maximizes themargin between different classes. Despite being one of the most popular classificationmodels because of its strong performance empirically; understanding the knowledgecaptured in an SVM remains difficult. SVMs are typically applied in a black-box mannerwhere the details of parameter tuning; training; and even the final constructed model arehidden from the users.

Lazylsh: Approximate nearest neighbor search for multiple distance functions with a single index,Yuxin Zheng; Qi Guo; Anthony KH Tung; Sai Wu,Abstract Due to the" curse of dimensionality" problem; it is very expensive to process thenearest neighbor (NN) query in high-dimensional spaces; and hence; approximateapproaches; such as Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH); are widely used for their theoreticalguarantees and empirical performance. Current LSH-based approaches target at the L1 andL2 spaces; while as shown in previous work; the fractional distance metrics (Lp metrics with0< p< 1) can provide more insightful results than the usual L1 and L2 metrics for data miningand multimedia applications. However; none of the existing work can support multiplefractional distance metrics using one index. In this paper; we propose LazyLSH that answersapproximate nearest neighbor queries for multiple Lp metrics with theoretical guarantees.Different from previous LSH approaches which need to build one dedicated index for …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,6
INSPIRE: A framework for incremental spatial prefix query relaxation,Yuxin Zheng; Zhifeng Bao; Lidan Shou; Anthony KH Tung,Geo-textual data are generated in abundance.

To ensure effective retrieval; various extensions were done including the allowanceof errors in keyword matching and auto completion using prefix matching. In this paper; wepropose INSPIRE; a general framework; which adopts a unifying strategy for processingdifferent variants of spatial keyword queries. We adopt the auto completion paradigm thatgenerates an initial query as a prefix matching query. If there are few matching results; othervariants are performed as a form of relaxation that reuses the processing done in the earlierphase. The types of relaxation allowed include spatial region expansion andexact/approximate prefix/substring matching.

Time evolution of self-assembled GaAs quantum rings grown by droplet epitaxy,KHP Tung; HW Gao; N Xiang,Abstract The correlation between the formation mechanism and the optical emission of GaAsquantum rings (QRs) is studied for the first time. The GaAs QRs were fabricated by thedroplet epitaxy technique on Al 0.3 Ga 0.7 As surface using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).Time evolution of these GaAs QRs with different arsenisation time is presented. Scanningelectron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to observe thestructural and geometrical changes during the formation of the GaAs QRs. Microstructuralchanges of the GaAs QRs were clearly seen in photoluminescence (PL) but barelyobservable in traditional surface spectroscopy techniques of SEM and AFM.

Microeconomic analysis using dominant relationship analysis,Ling Zhu; Cuiping Li; Anthony KH Tung; Shan Wang,Abstract The concept of dominance has recently attracted much interest in the context ofskyline computation. Given an N-dimensional data set S; a point p is said to dominate q if pis better than q in at least one dimension and equal to or better than it in the remainingdimensions. In this article; we propose extending the concept of dominance for businessanalysis from a microeconomic perspective. More specifically; we propose a new form ofanalysis; called Dominant Relationship Analysis (DRA); which aims to provide insight intothe dominant relationships between products and potential buyers. By analyzing suchrelationships; companies can position their products more effectively while remainingprofitable.

The spectral response of the structure in the absorption wascontrolled by coupling the SPR to the quantum energy level of the underlying QWNDsthrough adjusting the size of the disks. A 4.5-fold enhancement in PL intensity was obtainedwhen the SPR wavelength was tuned close to the light emission wavelength of the QWNDs.FDTD simulation consolidates the explanation of the measured spectral results and PLenhancement.,Optical Materials Express,2013,5
A cross-service travel engine for trip planning,Gang Chen; Chen Liu; Meiyu Lu; Beng Chin Ooi; Shanshan Ying; Anthony Tung; Dongxiang Zhang; Meihui Zhang,Abstract The online travel services and resources are far from well organized and integrated.Trip planning is still a laborious job requiring interaction with a combination of services suchas travel guides; personal travel blogs; map services and public transportation to piecetogether an itinerary. To facilitate this process; we have designed a cross-service travelengine for trip planners. Our system seamlessly and semantically integrates various types oftravel services and resources based on a geographical ontology. We also built a user-friendly visualization tool for travellers to conveniently browse and design personalitineraries on Google Maps.,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,5
Crew: cross-modal resource searching by exploiting wikipedia,Chen Liu; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony KH Tung; Dongxiang Zhang,Abstract In Web 2.0; users have generated and shared massive amounts of resources invarious media formats; such as news; blogs; audios; photos and videos. The abundanceand diversity of the resources call for better integration to improve the accessibility. Astraightforward approach is to link the resources via tags so that resources from differentmodals sharing the same tag can be connected as a graph structure. This naturallymotivates a new kind of information retrieval system; named cross-modal resource search; inwhich given a query object from any modal; all the related resources from other modals canbe retrieved in a convenient manner. However; due to the tag homonym and synonym; suchan approach returns results of low quality because resources with the same tag but notsemantically related will be directly connected as well. In this paper; we propose to build …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM international conference on Multimedia,2010,5
String join using precedence count matrix,Xia Cao; AHK Tung; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Shuai Cheng Li,In this paper; we propose a filter-and-refine string join algorithm. While the filtering phasecan rapidly prune away strings that are not joinable; the refinement phase employs acomprehensive algorithm to remove the remaining false alarms. The efficiency of theproposed scheme lies in the use of the precedence count matrix (PCM) for computing theedit distance between two sequences. With PCM; the complexity of sequence comparison isa constant time. We also evaluated the proposed sequence join algorithm; and our studyshows that it outperforms the known techniques.,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 2004.

Buffer management in distributed database systems: A data mining-based approach,Ling Feng; Hongjun Lu; YC Tay; KH Tung,Abstract In this paper; we propose a data mining-based approach to public buffermanagement in distributed database systems where database buffers are organized intotwo areas: public and private. While the private buffer areas contain pages to be updated byparticular users; the public buffer area contains pages shared among users from differentsites. Different from traditional buffer management strategies where limited knowledge ofuser access patterns is used; the proposed approach discovers knowledge from pageaccess sequences of user transactions and uses it to guide public buffer placement andreplacement. The knowledge to be discovered and the discovery algorithms are discussed.The effectiveness of the proposed approach was investigated through a simulation study.The results indicate that with the help of the discovered knowledge; the public buffer hit …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,1998,5
Cohort query processing,Dawei Jiang; Qingchao Cai; Gang Chen; HV Jagadish; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Modern Internet applications often produce a large volume of user activity records.Data analysts are interested in cohort analysis; or finding unusual user behavioral trends; inthese large tables of activity records. In a traditional database system; cohort analysisqueries are both painful to specify and expensive to evaluate. We propose to extenddatabase systems to support cohort analysis. We do so by extending SQL with three newoperators. We devise three different evaluation schemes for cohort query processing. Two ofthem adopt a non-intrusive approach. The third approach employs a columnar basedevaluation scheme with optimizations specifically designed for cohort query processing. Ourexperimental results confirm the performance benefits of our proposed columnar databasesystem; compared against the two non-intrusive approaches that implement cohort …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,4
Schema-as-you-go: on probabilistic tagging and querying of wide tables,Meiyu Lu; Divyakant Agrawal; Bing Tian Dai; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract The emergence of Web 2.0 has resulted in a huge amount of heterogeneous datathat are contributed by a large number of users; engendering new challenges for datamanagement and query processing. Given that the data are unified from various sourcesand accessed by numerous users; providing users with a unified mediated schema as dataintegration is insufficient. On one hand; a deterministic mediated schema restricts users'freedom to express queries in their preferred vocabulary; on the other hand; it is not realisticfor users to remember the numerous attribute names that arise from integrating various datasources. As such; a user-oriented data management and query interface is required. In thispaper; we propose an out-of-the-box approach that separates users' actions from databaseoperations. This separating layer deals with the challenges from a semantic perspective …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,4
kNR-tree: a novel R-tree-based index for facilitating spatial window queries on any k relations among N spatial relations in mobile environments,Anirban Mondal; Anthony KH Tung; Masaru Kitsuregawa,Abstract The ever-increasing popularity of mobile applications coupled with the prevalenceof spatial data has created the need for efficient processing of spatial queries in mobileenvironments. While different types of spatial queries (eg; spatial select queries; spatial joinqueries and nearest neighbour queries) need to be addressed in mobile environments; thiswork specifically addresses the processing of spatial select queries (ie; window queries) onany k relations among N spatial relations. We designate such window queries on any krelations among N spatial relations as kNW queries. Notably; the processing of kNW queriesis much more challenging in mobile environments than in traditional environments primarilydue to the mobility of the clients which issue the queries to the respective base stations. Themain contribution of this work is the proposal of the kNR-tree; a single integrated novel R …,Proceedings of the 6th international conference on Mobile data management,2005,4
SPARC: Spatial association rule-based classification,Jiawei Han; Anthony KH Tung; Jing He,Abstract Spatial classification is to classify spatial objects based on the spatial andnonspatial features of these objects in a database. The classification results; taken as themodels for the data; can be used for better understanding of the relationships among theobjects in the database and for prediction of characteristics and features of new objects.Spatial classification is a challenging task due to the sparsity of spatial features which leadsto high dimensionality and also the “curse of dimensionality. In this paper; we introduce anassociation-based spatial classification algorithm; called SPARC (SP atial A ssociation R ule-based C lassification); for efficient spatial classification in large geospatial databases.SPARC explores spatial association-based classification and integrates a few importanttechniques developed in spatial indexing and data mining to achieve high scalability …,*,2001,4
Generic inverted index on the GPU,Jingbo Zhou; Qi Guo; HV Jagadish; Wenhao Luan; Anthony KH Tung; Yueji Yang; Yuxin Zheng,Abstract: Data variety; as one of the three Vs of the Big Data; is manifested by a growingnumber of complex data types such as documents; sequences; trees; graphs and highdimensional vectors. To perform similarity search on these data; existing works mainlychoose to create customized indexes for different data types. Due to the diversity ofcustomized indexes; it is hard to devise a general parallelization strategy to speed up thesearch. In this paper; we propose a generic inverted index on the GPU (called GENIE);which can support similarity search of multiple queries on various data types. GENIE caneffectively support the approximate nearest neighbor search in different similarity measuresthrough exerting Locality Sensitive Hashing schemes; as well as similarity search on originaldata such as short document data and relational data.

The aim is to provide an automatic annotationinterface to satisfy users' information need; without cumbersome queries to traditional searchengines. The system consists of four components: text analysis; query construction; dataassignment; and user feedback. Through text analysis; the system decomposes a textdocument into appropriate topical passages; of which each is represented using detectedkey phrases. By submitting combinations of these phrases as queries to social mediasystems; the relevant results are used to suggest new annotations; that are linked to thecorresponding passages.

R2-d2: a system to support probabilistic path prediction in dynamic environments via semi-lazy learning,Jingbo Zhou; Anthony KH Tung; Wei Wu; Wee Siong Ng,Abstract Path prediction is presently an important area of research with a wide range ofapplications. However; most of the existing path prediction solutions are based on eagerlearning methods which commit to a model or a set of patterns extracted from historicaltrajectories. Such methods do not perform very well in dynamic environments where theobjects' trajectories are affected by many irregular factors which are not captured by pre-defined models or patterns. In this demonstration; we present the" R2-D2" system thatsupports probabilistic path prediction in dynamic environments. The core of our system is a"semi-lazy" learning approach to probabilistic path prediction which builds a prediction modelon the fly using historical trajectories that are selected dynamically based on the trajectoriesof target objects.

Arboricity: An acyclic hypergraph decomposition problem motivated by database theory,Yeow Meng Chee; Lijun Ji; Andrew Lim; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract The arboricity of a hypergraph H is the minimum number of acyclic hypergraphs thatpartition H. The determination of the arboricity of hypergraphs is a problem motivated bydatabase theory. The exact arboricity of the complete k-uniform hypergraph of order n ispreviously known only for k∈{1; 2; n− 2; n− 1; n}. The arboricity of the complete k-uniformhypergraph of order n is determined asymptotically when k= n− O (log 1− δ n); δ positive;and determined exactly when k= n− 3.

Integrating web 2.0 resources by wikipedia,Chen Liu; Bing Cui; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract The concept of Web 2.0 becomes prevalent and popular in the past few years.People are able to share and manage their own resources in Web 2.0 Systems. Theabundance of Web 2.0 resources in various media formats calls for better resourceintegration; intending to enrich user experience in both browsing and searching. Though theWeb 2.0 resources are shown in various modalities; their tags act as an intuitive medium toconnect resources together. However; tagging is by nature an ad hoc activity. They do oftencontain noises and are affected by the subjective inclination of taggers. Consequently;linking resources simply by tags will not be reliable. In this paper; we propose an effectiveapproach for linking tagged resources to concepts extracted from Wikipedia; which hasbecome a fairly reliable reference over the last few years. Compared to the tags; the …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM international conference on Multimedia,2010,3

Multilevel fast multipole method based on a potential formulation for 3D electromagnetic scattering problems,Mandiaye Fall; Salim Boutami; Alain Glière; Brian Stout; Jerome Hazart,A combination of the multilevel fast multipole method (MLFMM) and boundary elementmethod (BEM) can solve large scale photonics problems of arbitrary geometry. Here;MLFMM-BEM algorithm based on a scalar and vector potential formulation; instead of themore conventional electric and magnetic field formulations; is described. The method candeal with multiple lossy or lossless dielectric objects of arbitrary geometry; be they nested; incontact; or dispersed.

Coupling of surface plasmon with InGaAs/GaAs quantum well emission by gold nanodisk arrays,Hongwei Gao; Kar Hoo Patrick Tung; Jinghua Teng; Soo Jin Chua; Ning Xiang,Enhancement of photoluminescence (PL) intensity from InGaAs/GaAs quantum well (QW) isachieved experimentally by coupling surface plasmon (SP) resonance with QW emission.The SP resonance is generated by fabricating a periodic Au nanodisk array on top ofInGaAs/GaAs QW structure. A thin layer of SiO_2 between Au nanodisk and GaAs surfacehas been employed to achieve easy adjustment of the SP resonance. A 4.16 foldenhancement of PL intensity was observed. Theoretical simulation results match well withthe experimental results and confirm that the PL emission is enhanced by SP coupling withthe fabricated structure.,Applied optics,2013,2

It enables users to publish and read text-based posts; known as “tweets” andinteract with each other through re-tweeting or commenting. In the literature; many effortshave been devoted on exploiting the social property of Twitter. However; except the socialcomponent; Twitter itself has become an indispensable source for users to acquire usefulinformation. To maximize its value; we expect to pay more attention on the media property ofTwitter. To be good media; the first requirement is that it should provide an effectivepresentation of its news so that users are facilitated of reading. Currently; all tweets fromfollowings are presented to the users and usually organized by their published timelines orcoming sources.

Efficient approximation of the maximal preference scores by lightweight cubic views,Yueguo Chen; Bin Cui; Xiaoyong Du; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Given a multi-features data set; a best preference query (BPQ) computes themaximal preference score (MPS) that the tuples in the data set can achieve with respect to apreference function. BPQs are very useful in applications where users want to efficientlycheck whether many individual data sets contain tuples that are of interest to them. Althougha BPQ can be naïvely answered by issuing a top-1 query and computing the score from thereturned tuple; doing so might require to load a larger number of tuples externally. In thispaper; we address the problem of efficient processing BPQs by using lightweight cubic (3-dimensional) views. With these in-memory views; the MPSs of BPQs can be efficientlyestimated with an error bound guaranteed; by paying only a small number of I/Os.

SINGS: Similarity Search in Large Graph Databases,Xiaoli WANG; Xiaofeng DING; Anthony KH TUNG; Shanshan YING; Hai JIN,Graphs are popular models for representing complex structured data and similarity searchfor graphs has become a fundamental research problem. Many techniques have beenproposed to support similarity search on graphs based on the graph edit distance. However;they all suffer from certain drawbacks: high computational complexity; poor scalability interms of the number of graphs and the size of the graph; or not taking full advantage ofindexes. To address these problems; in this paper; we propose SINGS; an indexing andquery processing framework for graph similarity search.

Mining frequent 3d sequential patterns,Zhenqiang Tan; Anthony KH Tung,We propose a mining approach; MSP; to find the maximal sequential 3D patterns with theconstraints of minimum support and minimum confidence. Each pattern is a group of similarsequential 3D objects appearing in a given dataset. Mining sequential patterns in terms of3D coordinates is important and meaningful in many real-life applications. MSP finds out themaximal patterns in terms of both length and frequency without loss. MSP involves threestages: generating seeds with pairwise pattern mining; vertical extension to detect all hitswith a depth-first search and horizontal extension to extend the pattern length without loss ofhits. Furthermore; we propose a method to automatically detect proper settings in order toadapt MSP to various datasets. The experiments on protein chains and synthetic data showMSP significantly outperforms the alternative methods.

LDSScanner: Exploratory Analysis of Low-Dimensional Structures in High-Dimensional Datasets,Jiazhi Xia; Fenjin Ye; Wei Chen; Yusi Wang; Weifeng Chen; Yuxin Ma; Anthony KH Tung,Many approaches for analyzing a high-dimensional dataset assume that the datasetcontains specific structures; eg; clusters in linear subspaces or non-linear manifolds. Thisyields a trial-and-error process to verify the appropriate model and parameters. This papercontributes an exploratory interface that supports visual identification of low-dimensionalstructures in a high-dimensional dataset; and facilitates the optimized selection of datamodels and configurations. Our key idea is to abstract a set of global and local featuredescriptors from the neighborhood graph-based representation of the latent low-dimensional structure; such as pairwise geodesic distance (GD) among points and pairwiselocal tangent space divergence (LTSD) among pointwise local tangent spaces (LTS).

Mining frequent subgraphs from tremendous amount of small graphs using MapReduce,Zhe Peng; Tongtong Wang; Wei Lu; Hao Huang; Xiaoyong Du; Feng Zhao; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Frequent subgraph mining from a tremendous amount of small graphs is a primitiveoperation for many data mining applications. Existing approaches mainly focus oncentralized systems and suffer from the scalability issue. Consider the increasing volume ofgraph data and mining frequent subgraphs is a memory-intensive task; it is difficult to tacklethis problem on a centralized machine efficiently. In this paper; we therefore propose anefficient and scalable solution; called MRFSE; using MapReduce. MRFSE adopts thebreadth-first search strategy to iteratively extract frequent subgraphs; ie; all frequentsubgraphs with i+ 1 i+ 1 edges are generated based on frequent subgraphs with i edges atthe i th iteration.

Inthis chapter; we address this topic from the viewpoint of constrained clustering; ie; theproblem of finding clusters that satisfy certain user-specified constraints. More specifically;we begin with the problem of clustering under aggregate constraints (without privacyconsiderations) and explain how traditional algorithms for the unconstrained problem (eg;the c-means algorithm) break down in the presence of constraints. From there; we developscalable algorithms that overcome this problem and finally illustrate how our algorithm canalso be used for privacy-preserving data publishing.,Constrained Clustering: Advances in Algorithms; Theory; and Applications,2008,*
Edit Distance Evaluation on Graph Structures,Zhiping Zeng; Anthony KH Tung; Jianyong Wang; Lizhu ZHOU,Graph data has became ubiquitous and manipulating them based on similarity is essentialfor many applications. Graph edit distance is one of the most widely accepted measure todetermine similarities between graphs and has extensive applications in the fields of patternrecognition; computer vision etc. Unfortunately; the problem of graph edit dis-tancecomputation is NP-Hard in general and is unlikely to be approximated within a polynomialtime computable fac-tor f (n) in polynomial time. Accordingly; in this paper we introduce threenovel methods to compute the upper and lower bounds for the edit distance between twographs in polynomial time. Applying these methods; three algorithms AppFull; ExactSub andAppSub are introduced to per-form different kinds of graph search on graph databases.Comprehensive experimental studies are conducted on both real and synthetic datasets …,*,2008,*

Efficient Constrained Delaunay Triangulation for Large Spatial Databases,Xinyu WU; David HSU; Anthony KH TUNG,Delaunay Triangulation (DT) and its extension Constrained Delaunay Triangulation (CDT)are spatial data structures that have wide applications in spatial data processing. Our recentsurvey shows; however; that there is a surprising lack of algorithms for computing DT/CDTfor large spatial databases. In view of this; we propose an efficient algorithm based on thedivide and conquer paradigm. It computes DT/CDT on in-memory partitions before mergingthem into the final result. This is made possible by discovering mathematical property thatprecisely characterizes the set of triangles that are involved in the merging step. Ourextensive experiments show that the new algorithm outperforms another provably good disk-based algorithm by roughly an order of magnitude when computing DT. For CDT; which hasno known disk-based algorithm; we show that our algorithm scales up well for large …,*,2006,*

FAMCS: Finding all maximal common substructures in proteins,Zhen Yao; Juan Xiao; Anthony KH Tung; Wing Kin Sung,Finding the common substructures shared by two proteins is considered as one of thecentral issues in computational biology because of its usefulness in understanding thestructure-function relationship and application in drug and vaccine design. In this paper; wepropose a novel algorithm called FAMCS (Finding All Maximal Common Substructures) forthe common substructure identification problem. Our method works initially at the proteinsecondary structural element (SSE) level and starts with the identification of all structurallysimilar SSE pairs. These SSE pairs are then merged into sets using a modified Apriorialgorithm; which will test the similarity of various sets of SSE pairs incrementally until all themaximal sets of SSE pairs that deemed to be similar are found. The maximal commonsubstructures of the two proteins will be formed from these maximal sets. A refinement …,Genomics; proteomics & bioinformatics,2005,*

String recedence count matrix,Xia Cao; Anthony KH Tung; Beng Chin Ooi; K-L Tan; Shuai Cheng Li,In this paper; we propose a filter-and-refine string join algorithm. While the filtering phasecan rapidly prune away strings that are not joinable; the refinement phase employs acomprehensive algorithm to remove the remaining false alarms. The efficiency of theproposed scheme lies in the use of the precedence count matrix (PCM) for computing theedit distance between two sequences. With PCM; the complexity of sequence comparison isa constant time. We also evaluated the proposed sequence join algorithm; and our studyshows that it outperforms the known techniques.,*,2004,*

COE: Clustering with Obstacles Entities A Preliminary Study Anthony KH Tung Jean Hou Jiawei Han School of Computing Science Simon Fraser University,Anthony KH Tung; Jean Hou; Jiawei Han,Abstract. Clustering analysis has been a very active area of research in the data miningcommunity. However; most algorithms have ignored the fact that physical obstacles exist inthe real world and could thus affect the result of clustering dramatically. In this paper; we willlook at the problem of clustering in the presence of obstacles. We called this problem theCOE (Clustering with Obstacles Entities) problem and provide an outline of an algorithmcalled COE-CLARANS to solve it.,*,*,*

A Generic Inverted Index Framework for Similarity Search on the GPU,Jingbo Zhou; Qi Guo; HV Jagadish; Wenhao Luan; Anthony KH Tung; Yueji Yang; Yuxin Zheng,ABSTRACT To perform similarity search; existing works mainly choose to create customizedindexes for different data types. Due to the diversity of customized indexes; it is hard todevise a general parallelization strategy to speed up the search. In this paper; we propose ageneric inverted index framework on the GPU (called GENIE); which can support parallelsimilarity search of multiple queries on various data types. We also give an in-depthinvestigation to demonstrate how to properly fit both the Locality Sensitive Hashing schemeand the Shotgun and Assembly scheme to our framework for similarity search on the GPU.Extensive experiments on different real-life datasets demonstrate the efficiency andeffectiveness of our framework. The implemented system has been released as opensource1.,*,*,*
Efﬁciently Extracting Frequent Subgraphs using MapReduce,Anthony KH Tung; Feng Zhao,As a primitive operation; frequent subgraph extraction has a wide range of applications indata mining; such as extracting frequent patterns from chemical compounds; identifying therelationship between chemical compounds; and building graph indexes to facilitatesubgraph containment queries [20];[21];[3];[2]. Given a dataset D consisting of a set ofgraphs; a subgraph s is deﬁned to be frequent if the number of graphs in D containing s isnot less than a frequent threshold. The majority of existing work adopts a pattem-growthapproach [19];[1];[6];[7];[13] that typically applies the depth ﬁrst search strategy to extractfrequent subgraphs. Figure 1 shows an overview of how a pattern-growth approach works.Initially; by extracting every distinct edge from the graphs; it is easy to identify all frequentsize-1 subgraphs. Starting from a certain frequent size-1 subgraph s; s is then recursively …,*,*,*

FARMER: Finding Interesting Rule Groups in Biological Datasets,Gao Cong; Xin Xu; Feng Pan; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract The growth of bioinformatics has resulted in datasets with new characteristics.These datasets typically contain a large number of columns and a small number of rows. Forexample; many gene expression datasets may contain up to 10;000-100;000 columns butonly 100-1000 rows. Association rules can reveal biological relevant associations betweengenes and environmental/categories to identify gene regulation pathways. However; mostexisting association rule mining algorithms have an exponential dependence on the numberof columns. Moreover; the number of association rules generated from bioinformaticdatasets are enormous due to the combinatorial explosion of frequent itemsets. In this paper;we describe a new algorithm called FARMER that is specially designed to discoverinteresting rule groups by identifying their upper bounds and lower bounds from …,*,*,*
Efficient Maintenance of Effective NPC Teams in Massively Multiplayer Online Games by Character Binding,Yueguo Chen; Beng Chin Ooi; M Tamer Ozsu; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract—Managing the behavior of a huge number of non-player characters (NPCs) is amajor challenge in massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) for a few reasons. First;the moving characters are highly dynamic and their positioning is highly skewed in swarmregions. Second; players are more intelligent and they often collaborate as teams. Third; thecharacters are complex by design as they can be armed with different weapons and armors;possess different capabilities; and switch from one role to another. Decision making on thebehavior of NPCs in swarm regions is therefore complex because of the rich gamesemantics in these regions. NPCs in MMOGs are also required to act in teams so that theycan fight against teamed player characters (PCs) effectively. This leads to the problems ofdynamically managing team members and effectively analyzing information of the local …,*,*,*

Generic Analysis and Methods for Computing Skyline Variants,Zhenjie Zhang; Hua Lu; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Skyline queries are often used on data sets in multi-dimensional space for manydecision-making applications. Traditionally; a point p is said to dominate another point q if;for all dimension; it is no worse than q and is better on at least one dimension. Therefore; theskyline of a data set consists of all points not dominated by any other point. To better cater toapplication requirements such as controlling the size of the skyline or handling data sets thatare not well-structured; various works have been proposed to extend the definition of skylinebased on variants of the dominance relationship. However; it is difficult to implement each ofthese variants separately in a system setting and instead effort must be made to provide ageneral framework so that these specific implementations can be easily materialized overthe framework.,*,*,*

NUROP CONGRESS PAPER,FENG LIANG ZHU; ANTHONY TUNG,ABSTRACT An important open issue in KDD research is the reveal and handling ofuncertainty. Clustering is an important task in managing voluminous data to identifysignificant groups in an underlying data set and extract “interesting” knowledge from it. Anumber of clustering techniques and algorithms have been proposed and are available inliterature. Most existing algorithms assumes that the similarity between two objects welldefined; however; in many situations; the similarity between two objects can be uncertainand only upper/lower bounds on the similarity are given. In this report; we present anapproach for clustering with uncertainty handling; and if the objects can be made certain bypaying some cost; we show a heuristic to improve the quality of clustering while minimize thetotal cost for making some objects certain.,*,*,*
