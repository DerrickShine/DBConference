A systematic review of neighborhood disparities in point-of-sale tobacco marketing,Joseph GL Lee; Lisa Henriksen; Shyanika W Rose; Sarah Moreland-Russell; Kurt M Ribisl,We systematically reviewed evidence of disparities in tobacco marketing at tobacco retailersby sociodemographic neighborhood characteristics. We identified 43 relevant articles from893 results of a systematic search in 10 databases updated May 28; 2014. We found 148associations of marketing (price; placement; promotion; or product availability) with aneighborhood demographic of interest (socioeconomic disadvantage; race; ethnicity; andurbanicity). Neighborhoods with lower income have more tobacco marketing. There is morementhol marketing targeting urban neighborhoods and neighborhoods with more Blackresidents. Smokeless tobacco products are targeted more toward rural neighborhoods andneighborhoods with more White residents. Differences in store type partially explain thesedisparities. There are more inducements to start and continue smoking in lower-income …,American journal of public health,2015,62
Physicians’ attitudes and use of e-cigarettes as cessation devices; North Carolina; 2013,Kelly L Kandra; Leah M Ranney; Joseph GL Lee; Adam O Goldstein,Introduction Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are not currently approved or recommendedby the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or various medical organizations; yet; theyappear to play a substantial role in tobacco users' cessation attempts. This study reports ona physician survey that measured beliefs; attitudes; and behavior related to e-cigarettes andsmoking cessation. To our knowledge this is the first study to measure attitudes toward e-cigarettes among physicians treating adult smokers. Methods Using a direct marketingcompany; a random sample of 787 North Carolina physicians were contacted in 2013through email; with 413 opening the email and 128 responding (response rate= 31%).Physicians' attitudes towards e-cigarettes were measured through a series of close-endedquestions.

“Real Men Don't”: Constructions of Masculinity and Inadvertent Harm in Public Health Interventions,Paul J Fleming; Joseph GL Lee; Shari L Dworkin,Research shows that constraining aspects of male gender norms negatively influence bothwomen's and men's health. Messaging that draws on norms of masculinity in healthprogramming has been shown to improve both women's and men's health; but some typesof public health messaging (eg; Man Up Monday; a media campaign to prevent the spreadof sexually transmitted infections) can reify harmful aspects of hegemonic masculinity thatprograms are working to change. We critically assess the deployment of hegemonic malenorms in the Man Up Monday campaign. We draw on ethical paradigms in public health tochallenge programs that reinforce harmful aspects of gender norms and suggest the use ofgender-transformative interventions that challenge constraining masculine norms and havebeen shown to have a positive effect on health behaviors.,American journal of public health,2014,54
Statewide diffusion of 100% tobacco-free college and university policies,Joseph GL Lee; Adam O Goldstein; Kathryn D Kramer; Julea Steiner; Mark M Ezzell; Vandana Shah,Objectives As smoking among college students reached new highs in the 1990s; mostinterventions for college student smoking prevention focused on individual studentknowledge; attitudes and beliefs. No published studies report on statewide movements toaccelerate the adoption of tobacco-free policies on college campuses. The results of the first4 years of the North Carolina Tobacco-Free Colleges Initiative are presented. Methods TheNorth Carolina Health and Wellness Trust Fund developed a multilevel intervention toaccelerate the diffusion of tobacco-free policies on college campuses; including fundingcampus coordinators and coalitions to tailor activities to the campus environment at 64colleges.

Barring intervention? Lesbian and gay bars as an underutilized venue for tobacco interventions,Katherine Leibel; Joseph GL Lee; Adam O Goldstein; Leah M Ranney,Abstract Introduction: Lesbian; gay; bisexual; and transgender (LGBT) communities are athigh risk for tobacco use. While LGBT communities have historically considered bars to besafe places to socialize and congregate; these spaces are often tobacco-friendlyenvironments and may have potential as sites for much needed intervention. Interventions inBars: Only a few public health interventions have attempted to work through bars and clubsto decrease tobacco use in the LGBT populations. Evidence from HIV prevention suggestssome potential interventions in bars; and the tobacco industry has worked extensively (andsuccessfully) to utilize bars in marketing efforts. Conclusions: Lesbian and gay bars areunderutilized in tobacco control; suggesting missed avenues for chronic disease preventionprograms. Researchers and communities should continue to recognize the importance of …,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2011,28
Assessment of College and University Campus Tobacco-Free Policies in North Carolina,Joseph GL Lee; Adam O Goldstein; Elizabeth G Klein; Leah M Ranney; Ashlea M Carver,Abstract Objective: To develop a reliable and efficient method for assessing prevalence andstrength of college/university tobacco-related policies. Participants: North Carolina (NC)public universities; community colleges; and private colleges/universities (N= 110). Methods:A census of policies using campus handbooks and Web sites was conducted in March 2011.Results: The rating tool is reliable and valid. Ninety-nine percent of NC college/universitycampuses are smoke-free in all indoor areas. The majority (94/110 [85%]) of colleges anduniversities regulate smoking and/or tobacco in some or all outdoor areas. Less than 20% ofcampuses had restrictions for industry marketing; promotion; and sales. Conclusions: Cleanindoor air policies are present at all but 1 NC college/university campus; and a growingnumber have enacted broad outdoor limits to protect students; faculty; and staff from …,Journal of American College Health,2012,19
Adding sexual orientation questions to statewide public health surveillance: New Mexico's experience.,Nicole A VanKim; James L Padilla; Joseph GL Lee; Adam O Goldstein,We examined refusal rates for sensitive demographic questions to determine whetherquestions on sexual orientation are too sensitive for routine use on public health surveys.We compared the percentage of active refusals in New Mexico for a sexual orientationquestion and 6 other sensitive demographic questions. In 2007 and 2008; refusal rates forsexual orientation questions were similar to rates for questions on race/ethnicity and weightand significantly lower than rates for questions on household income. Perceptions thatsexual orientation is too controversial a topic to be included on state surveys may beunfounded.,American journal of public health,2010,19
Up in smoke: Vanishing evidence of tobacco disparities in the Institute of Medicine’s report on sexual and gender minority health,Joseph GL Lee; John R Blosnich; Cathy L Melvin,The Institute of Medicine (IOM) released a groundbreaking report on lesbian; gay; bisexual;and transgender (LGBT) health in 2011; finding limited evidence of tobacco disparities. Weexamined IOM search terms and used 2 systematic reviews to identify 71 articles on LGBTtobacco use. The IOM omitted standard tobacco-related search terms. The report alsoomitted references to studies on LGBT tobacco use (n= 56); some with rigorous designs. TheIOM report may underestimate LGBT tobacco use compared with general population use.,American journal of public health,2012,18
Out smoking on the big screen: tobacco use in LGBT movies; 2000–2011,Joseph GL Lee; Christine B Agnew-Brune; Justin A Clapp; John R Blosnich,Objective Lesbian; gay; bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people have significantly highersmoking prevalence than heterosexual people in the USA. The reasons for this disparityremain unclear. Tobacco use in movies has a substantial influence on tobacco usebehaviours; particularly among youth. Yet; no research has examined tobacco use in moviesfor LGBT audiences or containing LGBT characters. Methods We identified 81 US moviesfrom 2000 to 2011 with a theatre release and with LGBT themes or characters. We thenselected a random sample of these movies (n= 45) for quantitative content analysis toexamine the proportion of movies with depictions of tobacco use and the number ofoccurrences of tobacco use. Results Tobacco use was depicted in 87%(95% CI 80% to94%) of movies with an average of four occurrences of tobacco use per hour (95% CI 3 to …,Tobacco control,2014,17
Testing warning messages on smokers’ cigarette packages: a standardised protocol,Noel T Brewer; Marissa G Hall; Joseph GL Lee; Kathryn Peebles; Seth M Noar; Kurt M Ribisl,Purpose Lab experiments on cigarette warnings typically use a brief one-time exposure thatis not paired with the cigarette packs smokers use every day; leaving open the question ofhow repeated warning exposure over several weeks may affect smokers. This proof ofprinciple study sought to develop a new protocol for testing cigarette warnings that betterreflects real-world exposure by presenting them on cigarette smokers' own packs. MethodsWe tested a cigarette pack labelling protocol with 76 US smokers ages 18 and older. Weapplied graphic warnings to the front and back of smokers' cigarette packs. Results Mostsmokers reported that at least 75% of the packs of cigarettes they smoked during the studyhad our warnings. Nearly all said they would participate in the study again. Using cigarettepacks with the study warnings increased quit intentions (p< 0.05). Conclusions Our …,Tobacco control,2015,16

High Tobacco Use among Lesbian; Gay; and Bisexual Populations in West Virginian Bars and Community Festivals,Joseph GL Lee; Adam O Goldstein; Leah M Ranney; Jeff Crist; Anna McCullough,Abstract: With no information on tobacco use for lesbian; gay; or bisexual (LGB) populationsin West Virginia (WV); it is unclear if nationally-identified LGB tobacco disparities also existin this State. To address this data gap; we conducted a community tobacco survey in barsand events associated with the WV Pride Parade and Festival. Trained community surveyorsused electronic and paper survey instruments in bars (n= 6) in three WV cities andcommunity events associated with the WV Pride Parade and Festival. We analyzed resultsfrom 386 completed surveys from self-identified LGB individuals. Tobacco use among LGBbar patrons and LGB attendees at Pride-affiliated events was elevated (45%); as was currentcigarette use (41%). Users of cigars and chewing tobacco were frequently dual users ofcigarettes; with 80% and 60% reporting dual use; respectively.

Is there a relationship between the concentration of same-sex couples and tobacco retailer density?,Joseph GL Lee; William K Pan; Lisa Henriksen; Adam O Goldstein; Kurt M Ribisl,Abstract Background: Tobacco use is markedly higher among lesbian; gay; and bisexualpopulations than heterosexuals. Higher density of tobacco retailers is found inneighborhoods with lower income and more racial/ethnic minorities. Same-sex couples tendto live in similar neighborhoods; but the association of this demographic with tobacco retailerdensity has not been examined. Methods: For a national sample of 97 US counties; wecalculated the number of tobacco retailers per 1000 persons and rates of same-sex couplesper 1000 households in each census tract (n= 17 941). Using spatial regression; weexamined the association of these variables in sex-stratified models; includingneighborhood demographics and other environmental characteristics to examineconfounding.

Social ecology of tobacco surveillance data for sexual and gender minority populations,JG Lee,Since Hooker (1957) first sampled gay men outside of psychiatric institutions; it has been clearthat our under- standing of sexual minority health is strongly linked to sam- pling methods. Thework of Lombardi et al. (2008) should serve as a call to accelerate the diffusion of a simple “innova- tion ” to more states: the integration of a question on sexual orientation in routine tobaccosurveillance. This would ben- efit not only tobacco control but also other fields where dis- paritiesexist for sexual and gender minorities (eg; mental health; violence prevention; and HIV/STD preventionand control; King et al.; 2008 ; Mayer et al.; 2008 ) … Well-designed public health surveillancesystems are a fun- damental part of interventions addressing tobacco use dispari- ties; yet; thereis substantial room for improvement in how surveillance systems track indictors on health disparities( Gold; Dodd; & Neuman; 2008 ).

Single cigarette sales: state differences in FDA advertising and labeling violations; 2014; United States,Hannah M Baker; Joseph GL Lee; Leah M Ranney; Adam O Goldstein,Abstract Importance: Single cigarettes; which are sold without warning labels and oftenevade taxes; can serve as a gateway for youth smoking. The Family Smoking Preventionand Tobacco Control Act of 2009 gives the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)authority to regulate the manufacture; distribution; and marketing of tobacco products;including prohibiting the sale of single cigarettes. To enforce these regulations; the FDAconducted over 335 661 inspections between 2010 and September 30; 2014; and allocatedover $115 million toward state inspections contracts. Objective: To examine differences insingle cigarette violations across states and determine if likely correlates of single cigarettesales predict single cigarette violations at the state level.

" May I Buy a Pack of Marlboros; Please?" A Systematic Review of Evidence to Improve the Validity and Impact of Youth Undercover Buy Inspections,Joseph GL Lee; Kyle R Gregory; Hannah M Baker; Leah M Ranney; Adam O Goldstein,Most smokers become addicted to tobacco products before they are legally able to purchasethese products. We systematically reviewed the literature on protocols to assess underagepurchase and their ecological validity. We conducted a systematic search in May 2015 inPubMed and PsycINFO. We independently screened records for inclusion. We conducted anarrative review and examined implications of two types of legal authority for protocols thatgovern underage buy enforcement in the United States: criminal (state-level laws prohibitingsales to youth) and administrative (federal regulations prohibiting sales to youth). Tenstudies experimentally assessed underage buy protocols and 44 studies assessed theassociation between youth characteristics and tobacco sales.

While vape shops are now regulated bystate and federal agencies; not all states maintain lists of vape shops in operation. Standardways of identifying tobacco retailers through off-premise alcohol permits and business listingservices may not identify vape shops. We used four online business listing services (ie;Google Maps; ReferenceUSA; YellowPages. com; Yelp) to identify vape shops in twocounties in North Carolina (NC). In one county; we also assessed four vaping web sites. Wedrove primary and secondary roads to physically validate the identified stores and attempt toidentify stores not listed online.

Keeping the Community Posted: Lesbian; Gay; Bisexual; and Transgender Blogs and the Tobacco Epidemic,Joseph GL Lee,Abstract Purpose: Lesbian; gay; bisexual; and transgender (LGBT) people are more likely touse tobacco products than heterosexual people. This results in disproportionate death anddisability for LGBT communities. Yet; addressing the tobacco epidemic is generally low onthe agenda of LGBT community organizations; and LGBT individuals report lower levels ofsupport for some evidence-based tobacco prevention and control policies thanheterosexuals. Informed by agenda-setting theory; this study investigated coverage of thetobacco epidemic in LGBT news blogs. Methods: Sixteen blogs and 105 tobacco-relatedposts from 2003 to March 9; 2013; were identified; and a quantitative content analysis wasconducted. Results: Coverage of the tobacco epidemic was primarily concentrated in fourblogs and focused on the epidemiology of the epidemic and on tobacco-related policies …,LGBT Health,2013,3
“Their Packaging Has Always Been Like a Power”: A Qualitative Study of US Smokers’ Perceptions of Cigarette Pack Visual Design Features to Inform Product Regu...,Joseph GL Lee; Paige E Averett; Tiffany Blanchflower; Nunzio Landi; Kyle R Gregory,Abstract Cigarette packaging matters to consumer behavior. However; it is less clear whichchanges to packaging design would be salient for adult smokers. Such information iscritically important to regulators in the United States who are charged with reviewing newtobacco products for their impact on population health. In this qualitative study; US adultsmokers (n= 33) participated in six telephone-based focus groups in March 2017.

Point-of-sale cigarette purchase patterns among US adult smokers—National Adult Tobacco Survey; 2012–2014,Judy Kruger; Amal Jama; Joseph GL Lee; Sara Kennedy; Asha Banks; Saida Sharapova; Israel Agaku,Abstract Tobacco products are ubiquitous in most US retail environments. Given that data onpreferred point-of-sale purchase locations among US adult tobacco users are limited; anenhanced understanding of tobacco purchase locations can help inform tobacco controlpolicy; planning; and practice. We investigated prevalence and sociodemographiccharacteristics associated with cigarette purchase location among US adult smokers. Pooleddata came from the 2012–2013 (N= 60;192) and 2013–2014 (N= 75;233) National AdultTobacco Surveys. Current cigarette smokers (n= 18;005) aged≥ 18 were asked if theypurchased cigarettes within the previous 30 days (n= 15;182) and; if so; where they lastpurchased cigarettes.

An Experiment Assessing Punitive versus Wellness Framing of a Tobacco-Free Campus Policy on Students’ Perceived Level of University Support,Joseph GL Lee; Christopher J Purcell; Beth H Chaney,Abstract The objective of this study was to examine how different ways of describing ahypothetical tobacco-free campus policy would impact college students' perceived level ofsupport from the college. In the spring of 2016; we randomized 1885 undergraduatestudents in a required course to three message conditions in an online survey: control (nomessage); wellness (emphasizing promoting health and quitting support); and punitive(emphasizing consequences for violating the policy). The dependent variable was perceivedorganizational support. We selected items previously shown to be relevant for collegestudents (alpha= 0.92 in our data). Given significant non-normality; we used non-parametricKruskal-Wallis tests with pairwise comparisons to examine differences in perceivedorganizational support across the three conditions.

Methods We searched all years of PubMed (through May2016) using these terms: racial segregation; residential segregation; neighborhood racialcomposition (first terms) and (second terms) cancer incidence; mortality; survival; stage atdiagnosis; screening. The 17 (of 668) articles that measured both segregation and a canceroutcome were retained. Results Segregation contributed significantly to cancer and to racialcancer disparities in 70% of analyses; even after controlling for socioeconomic status andhealth insurance. Residing in segregated African-American areas was associated withhigher odds of later-stage diagnosis of breast and lung cancers; higher mortality rates andlower survival rates from breast and lung cancers; and higher cumulative cancer risks …,Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities,2016,2
Relationship Between Tobacco Retailers’ Point-of-Sale Marketing and the Density of Same-Sex Couples; 97 US Counties; 2012,Joseph GL Lee; Adam O Goldstein; William K Pan; Kurt M Ribisl,Abstract: The reasons for higher rates of smoking among lesbian; gay; and bisexual (LGB)people than among heterosexual people are not well known. Research on internal migrationand neighborhood selection suggests that LGB people are more likely to live inneighborhoods where the tobacco industry has historically targeted their marketing efforts(lower income; more racial/ethnic diversity). We used multi-level models to assess therelationship between the rate of same-sex couples per 1000 coupled households and 2012marketing characteristics of tobacco retailers (n= 2231) in 1696 census tracts in 97 UScounties. We found no evidence of tobacco marketing at retailers differing by same-sexcouple rates in census tracts with the exception of three findings in the opposite direction ofour hypotheses: a small; significant positive relationship for the rate of same-sex male …,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2015,2
Health Inequities among Lesbian; Gay; and Bisexual Adults in North Carolina; 2011–2014,Melissa M Barnhill; Joseph GL Lee; Ann P Rafferty,Inequalities in health have been identified for lesbian; gay; and bisexual (LGB) populationsnationally. Policies in the US South offer fewer protections for LGB people than in otherregions; yet; limited data exist for this region.

Limited indications of tax stamp discordance and counterfeiting on cigarette packs purchased in tobacco retailers; 97 counties; USA; 2012,Joseph GL Lee; Shelley D Golden; Kurt M Ribisl,Abstract Increasing the per-unit cost of tobacco products is one of the strongest interventionsfor tobacco control. In jurisdictions with higher taxes in the US; however; cigarette pack litterstudies show a substantial proportion of littered packs lack the appropriate tax stamp. Morelimited but still present counterfeiting also exists. We sought to examine the role of tobaccoretailers as a source for untaxed and counterfeit products. Data collectors purchasedNewport Green (menthol) or Marlboro Red cigarette packs in a national probability-basedsample of tobacco retailers (in 97 counties) from June–October 2012. They made no effort tobuy counterfeit or untaxed cigarettes. In this cross-sectional study; we assessed thepresence; tax authority; and type (low-tech thermal vs. encrypted) of cigarette pack taxstamps; concordance of tax stamps with where the pack was purchased; and; for …,Preventive Medicine Reports,2017,*

Challenges in North Carolina's Tobacco Retailer Youth Access Program,Kurtis G Kozel; Joseph GL Lee,To the Editor—In 2015; over a quarter of high school students in North Carolina reportedcurrent use of tobacco products; including cigarettes; electronic cigarettes; and cigars [1].Approximately 80% of these adolescents will continue tobacco use into adulthood; and; ofthese students; half will die from tobacco use [2]. Nearly 90% of current smokers started inhigh school [2].In response to statistics like these; North Carolina and; more recently; theFood and Drug Administration (FDA) enacted policies establishing a minimum age at whichit is legal to sell tobacco products. Since 2011; the FDA has funded the Division of MentalHealth to conduct or subcontract inspections at tobacco retailers across North Carolina.These funds come from fees on the tobacco industry. North Carolina has been awarded over$6;500;000 by the FDA for tobacco retailer inspections [4].,North Carolina Medical Journal,2017,*
Reasons for Caution When Emphasizing Health Disparities for Sexual and Gender Minority Adults in Public Health Campaigns,Joseph GL Lee; Hope Landrine; Ryan J Martin; Derrick D Matthews; Paige E Averett; Jeff Niederdeppe,Many public health campaigns and advocates seek to increase public awareness ofwelldocumented disparities in tobacco use and HIV among lesbian; gay; bisexual; andtransgender (LGBT) communities as part of their efforts to reduce these disparities. TheNational Stakeholder Strategy for Achieving Health Equity advocates this approach. TheCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); the Food and Drug Administration; andstate health departments emphasize the magnitude of LGBT disparities in media releasesand in some health communication campaigns. In a widely publicized example; nationalmedia covered the CDC's press release emphasizing that “half of black gay men and aquarter of Latino gay men [are] projected to be diagnosed [with HIV] within their lifetime.” 1,*,2017,*

Community-level inequalities in concussion education of youth football coaches,Emily Kroshus; Zachary Y Kerr; Joseph GL Lee,Introduction USA Football has made the Heads Up Football (HUF) concussion educationprogram available for coaches of youth football players. Existing evidence about theeffectiveness of the HUF coach education program is equivocal. For HUF and otherprograms; there is growing concern that even effective interventions can increaseinequalities if there is different uptake or impact by SES or other demographic factors.Understanding how adoption is patterned along these lines is important for understandingequity issues in youth football.

Coaches’ Implementation of the USA Football “Heads Up Football” Educational Program,Zachary Y Kerr; Emily Kroshus; Joseph GL Lee; Susan W Yeargin; Thomas P Dompier,An integral part of the Heads Up Football (HUF) educational program is the Player SafetyCoach (PSC); who is responsible for teaching other coaches within a youth football leagueabout safer blocking/tackling and injury prevention. This study examines the associationbetween youth football coaches' interactions with the PSC (ie; attending the PSC clinic at thebeginning of the season and seeing the PSC on-field during practices) and their subsequentimplementation of the HUF educational program. Data were collected via onlinequestionnaire completed by 1;316 youth football coaches from HUF leagues. Data wereanalyzed with frequencies and logistic regression. Nearly half of coaches (44.8%) did notattend the PSC clinic; 25.9% reported not seeing their league's PSC on the field on a regularbasis.

The Tobacco 21 Movement and Electronic Nicotine Delivery System Use Among Youth,Clare Meernik; Hannah M Baker; Joseph GL Lee; Adam O Goldstein,Cigarette smoking prevalence in the United States has significantly decreased over the pastfew decades to 15.1% among adults 1 and 9.3% among high school students. 2 Declinesare a result of a variety of tobacco control initiatives; including limits on tobacco marketing;higher per-unit cost of tobacco products; clean air legislation; mass media campaigns; andreductions in youth access. 3 At the same time; use of electronic nicotine delivery systems(ENDS) has rapidly increased. 2 The role of ENDS in reducing or exacerbating population-level morbidity and mortality from tobacco products remains hotly contested. The increaseduse of ENDS; and the fact that smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death inthe United States 3 indicate that additional policy interventions are needed to work towardthe tobacco “endgame.” One such intervention is raising the minimum legal sales age …,Pediatrics,2016,*
