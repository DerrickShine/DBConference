On discovery of gathering patterns from trajectories,Kai Zheng; Yu Zheng; Nicholas Jing Yuan; Shuo Shang,The increasing pervasiveness of location-acquisition technologies has enabled collection ofhuge amount of trajectories for almost any kind of moving objects. Discovering usefulpatterns from their movement behaviours can convey valuable knowledge to a variety ofcritical applications.

Towards efficient search for activity trajectories,Kai Zheng; Shuo Shang; Nicholas Jing Yuan; Yi Yang,The advances in location positioning and wireless communication technologies have led toa myriad of spatial trajectories representing the mobility of a variety of moving objects. Whileprocessing trajectory data with the focus of spatio-temporal features has been widely studiedin the last decade; recent proliferation in location-based web applications (eg; Foursquare;Facebook) has given rise to large amounts of trajectories associated with activityinformation; called activity trajectory. In this paper; we study the problem of efficient similaritysearch on activity trajectory database. Given a sequence of query locations; each associatedwith a set of desired activities; an activity trajectory similarity query (ATSQ) returns ktrajectories that cover the query activities and yield the shortest minimum match distance.

User oriented trajectory search for trip recommendation,Shuo Shang; Ruogu Ding; Bo Yuan; Kexin Xie; Kai Zheng; Panos Kalnis,Abstract Trajectory sharing and searching have received significant attentions in recentyears. In this paper; we propose and investigate a novel problem called User OrientedTrajectory Search (UOTS) for trip recommendation. In contrast to conventional trajectorysearch by locations (spatial domain only); we consider both spatial and textual domains inthe new UOTS query. Given a trajectory data set; the query input contains a set of intendedplaces given by the traveler and a set of textual attributes describing the traveler'spreference. If a trajectory is connecting/close to the specified query locations; and the textualattributes of the trajectory are similar to the traveler'e preference; it will be recommended tothe traveler for reference. This type of queries can bring significant benefits to travelers inmany popular applications such as trip planning and recommendation.

Stochastic skyline route planning under time-varying uncertainty,Bin Yang; Chenjuan Guo; Christian S Jensen; Manohar Kaul; Shuo Shang,Different uses of a road network call for the consideration of different travel costs: in routeplanning; travel time and distance are typically considered; and green house gas (GHG)emissions are increasingly being considered. Further; travel costs such as travel time andGHG emissions are time-dependent and uncertain. To support such uses; we proposetechniques that enable the construction of a multi-cost; time-dependent; uncertain graph(MTUG) model of a road network based on GPS data from vehicles that traversed the roadnetwork. Based on the MTUG; we define stochastic skyline routes that consider multiplecosts and time-dependent uncertainty; and we propose efficient algorithms to retrievestochastic skyline routes for a given source-destination pair and a start time.

Personalized trajectory matching in spatial networks,Shuo Shang; Ruogu Ding; Kai Zheng; Christian S Jensen; Panos Kalnis; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract With the increasing availability of moving-object tracking data; trajectory search andmatching is increasingly important. We propose and investigate a novel problem calledpersonalized trajectory matching (PTM). In contrast to conventional trajectory similaritysearch by spatial distance only; PTM takes into account the significance of each samplepoint in a query trajectory. A PTM query takes a trajectory with user-specified weights foreach sample point in the trajectory as its argument. It returns the trajectory in an argumentdata set with the highest similarity to the query trajectory. We believe that this type of querymay bring significant benefits to users in many popular applications such as route planning;carpooling; friend recommendation; traffic analysis; urban computing; and location-basedservices in general.

Interactive top-k spatial keyword queries,Kai Zheng; Han Su; Bolong Zheng; Shuo Shang; Jiajie Xu; Jiajun Liu; Xiaofang Zhou,Conventional top-k spatial keyword queries require users to explicitly specify theirpreferences between spatial proximity and keyword relevance. In this work we investigatehow to eliminate this requirement by enhancing the conventional queries with interaction;resulting in Interactive Top-k Spatial Keyword (ITkSK) query. Having confirmed the feasibilityby theoretical analysis; we propose a three-phase solution focusing on both effectivenessand efficiency. The first phase substantially narrows down the search space for subsequentphases by efficiently retrieving a set of geo-textual k-skyband objects as the initialcandidates. In the second phase three practical strategies for selecting a subset ofcandidates are developed with the aim of maximizing the expected benefit for learning userpreferences at each round of interaction.

Finding the most accessible locations: reverse path nearest neighbor query in road networks,Shuo Shang; Bo Yuan; Ke Deng; Kexin Xie; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract In this paper; we propose and investigate a novel spatial query called Reverse PathNearest Neighbor (R-PNN) search to find the most accessible locations in road networks.Given a trajectory data-set and a list of location candidates specified by users; if a location ois the Path Nearest Neighbor (PNN) of k trajectories; the influence-factor of o is defined as kand the R-PNN query returns the location with the highest influence-factor. The R-PNNquery is an extension of the conventional Reverse Nearest Neighbor (RNN) search. It canbe found in many important applications such as urban planning; facility allocation; trafficmonitoring; etc. To answer the R-PNN query efficiently; an effective trajectory data pre-processing technique is conducted in the first place.

Discovery of Path Nearby Clusters in Spatial Networks,Shuo Shang; Kai Zheng; Christian S Jensen; Bo Yang; Panos Kalnis; Guolin Li; Ji-Rong Wen,The discovery of regions of interest in large cities is an important challenge. We propose andinvestigate a novel query called the path nearby cluster (PNC) query that finds regions ofpotential interest (eg; sightseeing places and commercial districts) with respect to a user-specified travel route. Given a set of spatial objects O (eg; POIs; geo-tagged photos; or geo-tagged tweets) and a query route q; if a cluster c has high spatial-object density and isspatially close to q; it is returned by the query (a cluster is a circular region defined by acenter and a radius). This query aims to bring important benefits to users in popularapplications such as trip planning and location recommendation. Efficient computation of thePNC query faces two challenges: how to prune the search space during query processing;and how to identify clusters with high density effectively. To address these challenges; a …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,21
PNN query processing on compressed trajectories,Shuo Shang; Bo Yuan; Ke Deng; Kexin Xie; Kai Zheng; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Trajectory compression is widely used in spatial-temporal databases as it cannotably reduce (i) the computation/communication load of clients (GPS-enabled mobiledevices) and (ii) the storage cost of servers. Compared with original trajectories;compressed trajectories have clear advantages in data processing; transmitting; storing; etc.In this paper; we investigate a novel problem of searching the Path Nearest Neighbor basedon Compressed Trajectories (PNN-CT query). This type of query is conducted oncompressed trajectories and the target is to retrieve the PNN with the highest probability(lossy compression leads to the uncertainty); which can bring significant benefits to users inmany popular applications such as trip planning.

Best point detour query in road networks,Shuo Shang; Ke Deng; Kexin Xie,Abstract A point detour is a temporary deviation from a user preferred path P (not necessarilya shortest network path) for visiting a data point such as a supermarket or McDonald's. Thegoodness of a point detour can be measured by the additional traveling introduced; calledpoint detour cost or simply detour cost. Given a preferred path to be traveling on; Best PointDetour (BPD) query aims to identify the point detour with the minimum detour cost. Thisproblem can be frequently found in our daily life but is less studied. In this work; the efficientprocessing of BPD query is investigated with support of devised optimization techniques.Furthermore; we investigate continuous-BPD query with target at the scenario where thepath to be traveling on continuously changes when a user is moving to the destination alongthe preferred path. The challenge of continuous-BPD query lies in finding a set of update …,2010 the 18th ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS,2010,18
Bounded quadrant system: Error-bounded trajectory compression on the go,Jiajun Liu; Kun Zhao; Philipp Sommer; Shuo Shang; Brano Kusy; Raja Jurdak,Long-term location tracking; where trajectory compression is commonly used; has gainedhigh interest for many applications in transport; ecology; and wearable computing. However;state-of-the-art compression methods involve high space-time complexity or achieveunsatisfactory compression rate; leading to rapid exhaustion of memory; computation;storage and energy resources. We propose a novel online algorithm for error-boundedtrajectory compression called the Bounded Quadrant System (BQS); which compressestrajectories with extremely small costs in space and time using convex-hulls. In thisalgorithm; we build a virtual coordinate system centered at a start point; and establish arectangular bounding box as well as two bounding lines in each of its quadrants.

In this light; we study a novel problem of planning unobstructed paths in traffic-awarespatial networks (TAUP queries) to avoid potential traffic congestions. We propose twoprobabilistic TAUP queries:(1) a time-threshold query like “what is the path from the check-indesk to the flight SK 1217 with the minimum congestion probability to take at most 45minutes?”; and (2) a probability-threshold query like “what is the fastest path from the check-in desk to the flight SK 1217 whose congestion probability is less than 20%?”. These queriesare mainly motivated by indoor space applications; but are also applicable in outdoorspaces. We believe that these queries are useful in some popular applications; such asplanning unobstructed paths for VIP bags in airports and planning convenient routes for …,GeoInformatica,2015,13
Finding alternative shortest paths in spatial networks,Kexin Xie; Ke Deng; Shuo Shang; Xiaofang Zhou; Kai Zheng,Abstract Shortest path query is one of the most fundamental queries in spatial networkdatabases. There exist algorithms that can process shortest path queries in real time.However; many complex applications require more than just the calculation of a singleshortest path. For example; one of the common ways to determine the importance (or price)of a vertex or an edge in spatial network is to use Vickrey pricing; which intuitively values thevertex v (or edge e) based on how much harder for travelling from the sources to thedestinations without using v (or e). In such cases; the alternative shortest paths without usingv (or e) are required. In this article; we propose using a precomputation based approach forboth single pair alternative shortest path and all pairs shortest paths processing. To computethe alternative shortest path between a source and a destination efficiently; a naïive way …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2012,12

Searching Trajectories by Regions of Interest,Shuo Shang; Lisi Chen; Christian S Jensen; Ji-Rong Wen; Panos Kalnis,With the increasing availability of moving-object tracking data; trajectory search isincreasingly important. We propose and investigate a novel query type named trajectorysearch by regions of interest (TSR query). Given an argument set of trajectories; a TSRquery takes a set of regions of interest as a parameter and returns the trajectory in theargument set with the highest spatial-density correlation to the query regions. This type ofquery is useful in many popular applications such as trip planning and recommendation;and location based services in general. TSR query processing faces three challenges: howto model the spatial-density correlation between query regions and data trajectories; how toeffectively prune the search space; and how to effectively schedule multiple so-called querysources. To tackle these challenges; a series of new metrics are defined to model spatial …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,8

Modeling of traffic-aware travel time in spatial networks,Shuo Shang; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen; Xike Xie,Route evaluation and optimization have received significant attention in recent years. In thislight; we propose and investigate a novel problem of estimating the travel time (TTE query)for a user specified path by considering the related traffic conditions. Given a query path anda departure time; TTE query finds the estimated travel time along this path. We believe thatthis type of query may bring important benefits to users in many popular applications; suchas travel route evaluation and optimization; and route planning and recommendation. Toaddress the TTE problem in a convincing approach; we construct a traffic-aware spatialnetwork G pt (V; E) by analysing uncertain trajectory data of moving objects. Based on G pt(V; E); we define two novel types of TTE queries: TTE ep for an exact query path; and TTE lpfor a loose query path.

Different types of neuroimaging have been developed tohelp such diagnosis; and significant research efforts are put into the automation andquantification of such diagnosis by computer algorithms over the past decades. In this paperwe propose an ensemble learning framework to create effective models for AD/MCI relatedclassification tasks from multiple modalities of neuroimaging and multiple baselineestimators.

Cost reduction for web-based data imputation,Zhixu Li; Shuo Shang; Qing Xie; Xiangliang Zhang,Abstract Web-based Data Imputation enables the completion of incomplete data sets byretrieving absent field values from the Web. In particular; complete fields can be used askeywords in imputation queries for absent fields. However; due to the ambiguity of thesekeywords and the data complexity on the Web; different queries may retrieve differentanswers to the same absent field value. To decide the most probable right answer to eachabsent filed value; existing method issues quite a few available imputation queries for eachabsent value; and then vote on deciding the most probable right answer. As a result; wehave to issue a large number of imputation queries for filling all absent values in anincomplete data set; which brings a large overhead. In this paper; we work on reducing thecost of Web-based Data Imputation in two aspects: First; we propose a query execution …,Database Systems for Advanced Applications (DASFAA); International Conference on,2014,6
Compressing large scale urban trajectory data,Kuien Liu; Yaguang Li; Jian Dai; Shuo Shang; Kai Zheng,Abstract With the increasing size of trajectory data generated by location-based services andapplications which are built from inexpensive GPS-enabled devices in urban environments;the need for compressing large scale trajectories becomes obvious. This paper proposes ascalable urban trajectory compression scheme (SUTC) that can compress a set oftrajectories collectively by exploiting common movement behaviors among the urbanmoving objects such as vehicles and smartphone users. SUTC exploits that urban objectsmoving in similar behaviors naturally; especially large-scale of human and vehicle which aremoving constrained by some geographic context (eg; road networks or routes). To exploitredundancy across a large set of trajectories; SUTC first transforms trajectory sequencesfrom Euclidean space to network-constrained space and represents each trajectory with a …,Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Cloud Data and Platforms,2014,6
Local correlation detection with linearity enhancement in streaming data,Qing Xie; Shuo Shang; Bo Yuan; Chaoyi Pang; Xiangliang Zhang,Abstract This paper addresses the challenges in detecting the potential correlation betweennumerical data streams; which facilitates the research of data stream mining and patterndiscovery. We focus on local correlation with delay; which may occur in burst at different timein different streams; and last for a limited period. The uncertainty on the correlationoccurrence and the time delay make it difficult to monitor the correlation online. Furthermore;the conventional correlation measure lacks the ability of reflecting visual linearity; which ismore desirable in reality. This paper proposes effective methods to continuously detect thecorrelation between data streams. Our approach is based on the Discrete Fourier Transformto make rapid cross-correlation calculation with time delay allowed. In addition; we introducea shape-based similarity measure into the framework; which refines the results by …,Information & Knowledge Management (CIKM); 2013 ACM 22nd International Conference on,2013,6

A Novel Framework for Online Amnesic Trajectory Compression in Resource-Constrained Environments,Jiajun Liu; Kun Zhao; Philipp Sommer; Shuo Shang; Brano Kusy; Jae-Gil Lee; Raja Jurdak,State-of-the-art trajectory compression methods usually involve high space-time complexityor yield unsatisfactory compression rates; leading to rapid exhaustion of memory;computation; storage; and energy resources. Their ability is commonly limited whenoperating in a resource-constrained environment especially when the data volume (evenwhen compressed) far exceeds the storage limit. Hence; we propose a novel onlineframework for error-bounded trajectory compression and ageing called the AmnesicBounded Quadrant System (ABQS); whose core is the Bounded Quadrant System (BQS)algorithm family that includes a normal version (BQS); Fast version (FBQS); and aProgressive version (PBQS).

Top-k neighborhood dominating query,Xike Xie; Hua Lu; Jinchuan Chen; Shuo Shang,Abstract In many real-life applications; spatial objects are associated with multiple non-spatial attributes. For example; a hotel may have price and rating in addition to itsgeographic location. In traditional spatial databases; spatial objects are often ranked solelybased on their distance to a given query location; eg; in a nearest neighbor search. Inanother line of research; domination based skyline queries are used to return best objectsaccording to multi-criteria on non-spatial attributes. In this paper; we study how to rankspatial objects with respect to their non-spatial attributes within their spatial neighborhoods.To enable a general ranking; we design a ranking function that inherits the advantages ofdominance relationship and integrates them with spatial proximity. Further; we propose aneffective index structure; and a branch and bound solution that executes the ranking …,Database Systems for Advanced Applications (DASFAA); 2013 International Conference on,2013,5
Efficient task assignment in spatial crowdsourcing with worker and task privacy protection,An Liu; Weiqi Wang; Shuo Shang; Qing Li; Xiangliang Zhang,Abstract Spatial crowdsourcing (SC) outsources tasks to a set of workers who are required tophysically move to specified locations and accomplish tasks. Recently; it is emerging as apromising tool for emergency management; as it enables efficient and cost-effectivecollection of critical information in emergency such as earthquakes; when search and rescuesurvivors in potential ares are required. However in current SC systems; task locations andworker locations are all exposed in public without any privacy protection. SC systems ifattacked thus have penitential risk of privacy leakage. In this paper; we propose a protocolfor protecting the privacy for both workers and task requesters while maintaining thefunctionality of SC systems. The proposed protocol is built on partially homomorphicencryption schemes; and can efficiently realize complex operations required during task …,GeoInformatica,2017,4
Matrix Sketching Over Sliding Windows,Zhewei Wei; Xuancheng Liu; Feifei Li; Shuo Shang; Xiaoyong Du; Ji-Rong Wen,Abstract Large-scale matrix computation becomes essential for many data data applications;and hence the problem of sketching matrix with small space and high precision has receivedextensive study for the past few years. This problem is often considered in the row-updatestreaming model; where the data set is a matrix A--R nxd; and the processor receives a row(1 xd) of A at each timestamp. The goal is to maintain a smaller matrix (termedapproximation matrix; or simply approximation) B--R lxd as an approximation to A; such thatthe covariance error| AT AB TB| is small and l ll n. This paper studies continuous trackingapproximations to the matrix defined by a sliding window of most recent rows. We considerboth sequence-based and time-based window. We show that maintaining ATA exactlyrequires linear space in the sliding window model; as opposed to O (d 2) space in the …,SIGMOD 2016,2016,4
Moir/uots: Trip recommendation with user oriented trajectory search,Kuien Liu; Bin Yang; Shuo Shang; Yaguang Li; Zhiming Ding,Trajectory search plays an important role in various applications such as trip planning andrecommendation. However; most existing studies only focus on spatial proximity but ignoreindividual users' preferences. For example; it is inappropriate to recommend a routecontaining gravel roads to travelers without off-road vehicles. To accommodate various userpreferences; we develop MOIR/UOTS; a trip recommendation system that supports UserOriented Trajectory Search (UOTS)[5];[7] based on our previous MOIR platform [2];[4].Meanwhile; MOIR/UOTS also functions as a test-bed system for exploring and evaluatingnovel trajectory searching algorithms. In particular; we demonstrate how ordinary users caninteract with MOIR/UOTS to search for trajectories with their preferences; and howMOIR/UOTS helps researchers to evaluate the performance of various algorithms.,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on,2013,4

Dimension reduction with meta object-groups for efficient image retrieval,Shuo Shang; Jiajun Liu; Kun Zhao; Mingrui Yang; Kai Zheng; Ji-rong Wen,Abstract Bag-of-Word (BoW) has been a prominent form for representing visual content suchas image and video in recent years; as a result of its unique capability of characterizingvisual content in a picture-level while still preserving part of the object-level information.However; it is also noticed that the dimensionality of BoW is usually as high as a fewhundreds or even thousands; posing a serious challenge for any application that requiresefficient processing. In this paper we propose a dimension reduction method called Metaobject-Group Component (MGC) to tackle this problem. MGC aims at discovering the hiddenrelations of objects by examining the correlations between dimensions in the BoW featuresand maximizing the relations of the members in a meta object-group.

VID join: Mapping trajectories to points of interest to support location-based services,Shuo Shang; Kexin Xie; Kai Zheng; Jiajun Liu; Ji-Rong Wen,Abstract Variable influence duration (VID) join is a novel spatio-temporal join operationbetween a set T of trajectories and a set P of spatial points. Here; trajectories are travelinghistories of moving objects (eg; travelers); and spatial points are points of interest (POIs; eg;restaurants). VID join returns all pairs of (τ s; p) if τ s is spatially close to p for a long period oftime; where τ s is a segment of trajectory τ∈ T and p∈ P. Each returned (τ s; p) implies thatthe moving object associated with τ s stayed at p (eg; having dinner at a restaurant). Suchinformation is useful in many aspects; such as targeted advertising; social security; andsocial activity analysis. The concepts of influence and influence duration are introduced tomeasure the spatial closeness between τ and p; and the time spanned; respectively.Compared to the conventional spatio-temporal join; the VID join is more challenging …,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2015,3

It is possible to integratemulti-source human tracking data and location based social media data; which includesspatial data; temporal data; and textual data; to make human-mobility prediction and over-crowded station detection; and then to plan convenient bus/subway routes for passengers.This study is useful in many real applications; including convenient travel routerecommendation and location based services in general. We face two challenges in thisstudy:(1) how to use multi-source human tracking data to model probabilistic transfer costbetween different bus/subway lines practically; and (2) how to compute convenientbus/subway routes efficiently.

Trajectory Similarity Join in Spatial Networks,Shuo Shang; Lisi Chen; Zhewei Wei; Christian S Jensen; Kai Zheng; Panos Kalnis,Abstract The matching of similar pairs of objects; called similarity join; is fundamentalfunctionality in data management. We consider the case of trajectory similarity join (TS-Join);where the objects are trajectories of vehicles moving in road networks. Thus; given two setsof trajectories and a threshold θ; the TS-Join returns all pairs of trajectories from the two setswith similarity above θ. This join targets applications such as trajectory near-duplicatedetection; data cleaning; ridesharing recommendation; and traffic congestion prediction.With these applications in mind; we provide a purposeful definition of similarity. To enableefficient TS-Join processing on large sets of trajectories; we develop search space pruningtechniques and take into account the parallel processing capabilities of modern processors.Specifically; we present a two-phase divide-and-conquer algorithm.

Dynamic Shortest Path Monitoring in Spatial Networks,Shuo Shang; Lisi Chen; Zhe-Wei Wei; Dan-Huai Guo; Ji-Rong Wen,Abstract With the increasing availability of real-time traffic information; dynamic spatialnetworks are pervasive nowadays and path planning in dynamic spatial networks becomesan important issue. In this light; we propose and investigate a novel problem of dynamicallymonitoring shortest paths in spatial networks (DSPM query). When a traveler aims to adestination; his/her shortest path to the destination may change due to two reasons: 1) thetravel costs of some edges have been updated and 2) the traveler deviates from the pre-planned path. Our target is to accelerate the shortest path computing in dynamic spatialnetworks; and we believe that this study may be useful in many mobile applications; such asroute planning and recommendation; car navigation and tracking; and location-basedservices in general. This problem is challenging due to two reasons: 1) how to maintain …,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2016,2
Discovering Neighborhood Pattern Queries by sample answers in knowledge base,Jialong Han; Kai Zheng; Aixin Sun; Shuo Shang; Ji-Rong Wen,Knowledge bases have shown their effectiveness in facilitating services like Web searchand question-answering. Nevertheless; it remains challenging for ordinary users to fullyunderstand the structure of a knowledge base and to issue structural queries. In manycases; users may have a natural language question and also know some popular (but notall) entities as sample answers. In this paper; we study the Reverse top-k NeighborhoodPattern Query problem; with the aim of discovering structural queries of the question basedon:(i) the structure of the knowledge base; and (ii) the sample answers of the question. Theproposed solution contains two phases: filter and refine. In the filter phase; a search space ofcandidate queries is systematically explored. The invalid queries whose result sets do notfully cover the sample answers are filtered out. In the refine phase; all surviving queries …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,2
SharkDB: an in-memory column-oriented storage for trajectory analysis,Bolong Zheng; Haozhou Wang; Kai Zheng; Han Su; Kuien Liu; Shuo Shang,Abstract The last decade has witnessed the prevalence of sensor and GPS technologies thatproduce a high volume of trajectory data representing the motion history of moving objects.However some characteristics of trajectories such as variable lengths and asynchronoussampling rates make it difficult to fit into traditional database systems that are disk-based andtuple-oriented. Motivated by the success of column store and recent development of in-memory databases; we try to explore the potential opportunities of boosting the performanceof trajectory data processing by designing a novel trajectory storage within main memory. Incontrast to most existing trajectory indexing methods that keep consecutive samples of thesame trajectory in the same disk page; we partition the database into frames in which thepositions of all moving objects at the same time instant are stored together and aligned in …,World Wide Web,2018,1
Discovery of probabilistic nearest neighbors in traffic-aware spatial networks,Shuo Shang; Shunzhi Zhu; Danhuai Guo; Minhua Lu,Abstract Travel planning and recommendation have received significant attention in recentyears. In this light; we study a novel problem of discovering probabilistic nearest neighborsand planning the corresponding travel routes in traffic-aware spatial networks (TANNqueries) to avoid potential time delay/traffic congestions. We propose and study four novelprobabilistic TANN queries. Thereinto two queries target at minimizing the travel time;including a congestion-probability threshold query; and a time-delay threshold query; whileanother two travel-time threshold queries target at minimizing the potential time delay/trafficcongestion. We believe that TANN queries are useful in many real applications; such asdiscovering nearby points of interest and planning convenient travel routes for users; andlocation based services in general. The TANN queries are challenged by two difficulties …,World Wide Web,2017,1
Probabilistic Nearest Neighbor Query in Traffic-Aware Spatial Networks,Shuo Shang; Zhewei Wei; Ji-Rong Wen; Shunzhi Zhu,Abstract Travel planning and recommendation have received significant attention in recentyears. In this light; we study a novel problem of finding probabilistic nearest neighbors andplanning the corresponding travel routes in traffic-aware spatial networks (TANN queries) toavoid traffic congestions. We propose and study two probabilistic TANN queries:(1) a time-threshold query like “what is my closest restaurant with the minimum congestion probabilityto take at most 45 min?”; and (2) a probability-threshold query like “what is the fastest path tomy closest petrol station whose congestion probability is less than 20%?”. We believe thatthis type of queries may benefit users in many popular mobile applications; such asdiscovering nearby points of interest and planning convenient travel routes for users.

Following the dynamic block on the Web,Sha Hu; Ji-Rong Wen; Zhicheng Dou; Shuo Shang,Abstract With the rapid changes in dynamic web pages; there is an increasing need forreceiving instant updates for dynamic blocks on the Web. In this paper; we address theproblem of automatically following dynamic blocks in web pages. Given a user-specifiedblock on a web page; we continuously track the content of the block and report the updatesin real time. This service can bring obvious benefits to users; such as the ability to track top-ten breaking news on CNN; the prices of iPhones on Amazon; or NBA game scores. Westudy 3;346 human labeled blocks from 1;127 pages; and analyze the effectiveness of fourtypes of patterns; namely visual area; DOM tree path; inner content and close context; fortracking content blocks. Because of frequent web page changes; we find that the initialpatterns generated on the original page could be invalidated over time; leading to the …,World Wide Web,2016,1
Benchmarking big data for trip recommendation,Kuien Liu; Yaguang Li; Zhiming Ding; Shuo Shang; Kai Zheng,The availability of massive trajectory data collected from GPS devices has receivedsignificant attentions in recent years. A hot topic is trip recommendation; which focuses onsearching trajectories that connect (or are close to) a set of query locations; eg; severalsightseeing places specified by a traveller; from a collection of historic trajectories made byother travellers. However; if we know little about the sample coverage of trajectory datawhen developing an application of trip recommendation; it is difficult for us to answer manypractical questions; such as 1) how many (future) queries can be supported with a given setof raw trajectories? 2) how many trajectories are required to achieve a good-enough result?3) how frequent the update operations need to be performed on trajectory data to keep itlong-term effective? In this paper; we focus on studying the overall quality of trajectory …,Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN); 2014 23rd International Conference on,2014,1
Location-Based Top-k Term Querying over Sliding Window,Ying Xu; Lisi Chen; Bin Yao; Shuo Shang; Shunzhi Zhu; Kai Zheng; Fang Li,Abstract In part due to the proliferation of GPS-equipped mobile devices; massive svolumesof geo-tagged streaming text messages are becoming available on social media. It is ofgreat interest to discover most frequent nearby terms from such tremendous stream data. Inthis paper; we present novel indexing; updating; and query processing techniques that arecapable of discovering top-k locally popular nearby terms over a sliding window.Specifically; given a query location and a set of geo-tagged messages within a slidingwindow; we study the problem of searching for the top-k terms by considering both the termfrequency and the proximities between the messages containing the term and the querylocation. We develop a novel and efficient mechanism to solve the problem; including aquad-tree based indexing structure; indexing update technique; and a best-first based …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2017,*

Spatial query processing for trip planning and location recommendation,Shuo Shang,The continuous proliferation of GPS-enabled mobile devices (eg; car navigation systems;smart phones and PDAs) and the rapid development of online map services (eg; Google-maps 1; Bingmaps 2 and MapQuest 3) enable people to acquire their current geographicpositions in real time and to interact with servers to query the spatial information regardingtheir decisions. The potential market of such location based services in the near futurecreates various mobile applications. An emerging one is Trip Planning and LocationRecommendation; which is designed to plan the convenient routes and recommend suitablelocations (POIs: points of interests) to users. In this thesis; we propose and investigate aseries of novel problems on trip planning and location recommendation in spatial networks;and provide effective and efficient solutions for them under various problem settings.

Efficient best path monitoring in road networks for instant local traffic information,Shuo Shang; Ke Deng; Kai Zheng,Abstract The shortest path problem has been well studied previously. To improve the utility;the traffic conditions can be modeled to associate a weight to each road segment. Therecent trend is to apply data mining techniques over use history which usually covers a longperiod of time such as months. However; this method fails to reflect the instant (ie temporary)traffic conditions change such as traffic accident or road work. Due to the temporary nature;the local instant traffic conditions makes more sense when an object is moving in roadnetworks. In this work; we investigate the shortest path monitoring problem while the instanttraffic conditions in local region update repeatedly around a moving object to a givendestination. A simple way is to apply A* algorithm repeatedly. However; the weakness isobvious. Because only a small fraction; ie the local area; of the whole networks have …,Proceedings of the Twenty-First Australasian Conference on Database Technologies-Volume 104,2010,*
