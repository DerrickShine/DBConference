Solution structure of d-GAATTCGAATTC by 2D NMR: A new approach to determination of sugar geometries in DNA segments,RV Hosur; M Ravikumar; KVR Chary; Anu Sheth; Girjesh Govil; Tan Zu-Kun; H Todd Miles,Abstract A new approach based on the correlated spectroscopy (COSY) in 2D NMR hasbeen described for determination of sugar geometries in oligonucleotides. Under the usuallow resolution conditions employed in COSY; the intensities of cross peaks depend on themagnitudes of coupling constants. There are five vicinal coupling constants in a deoxyribosering which are sensitive to the sugar geometry. The presence; absence and roughcomparison of relative intensities of COSY cross peaks arising from such coupling constantsenable one to fix the sugar conformation to a fair degree of precision. The methodology hasbeen applied to d-GAATTCGAATTC. It is observed that ten out of the twelve nucleotide unitsin this sequence exhibit a rare Ol′-endo geometry. The EcoRI cleavage sites (between Gand A) in the dodecanucleotide show an interesting variation in the conformation with the …,FEBS letters,1986,50
J-scaling in two-dimensional homonuclear correlated spectroscopy for enhancement of cross peak intensities,RV Hosur; KVR Chary; M Ravi Kumar,Abstract New pulse schemes have been proposed for enhancement of cross peakintensities in two-dimensional homonuclear correlated spectra.

Relaxation and dynamics of coupled spin systems subjected to continuous radio frequency fields,Muppirala Ravikumar; Rajesh Shukla; Aksel A Bothner‐By,A computational method for the prediction of spin trajectories in systems of two or more spinsevolving under the influence of the static field; an applied radio frequency field; chemicalshifts; spin–spin couplings; and magnetic dipolar relaxation has been described. Theprogram has been tested to establish its correct operation by calculation of limiting caseswith known solutions. It is shown that it is necessary to retain the nonsecular elements of therelaxation matrix in order to obtain correct results; primarily elements controlling crossrelaxation between transverse components of magnetization of different spin statesbelonging to the same quantum number of the total magnetization along the axis of the staticfield. As a result of the retention of these terms; two unexpected features are predicted:frequency and phase shifts in spectra of two non‐spin‐coupled nuclei with relaxation rate …,The Journal of chemical physics,1991,23

Application of J scaling in two-dimensional spin-echo-correlated spectroscopy to observation of small coupling correlations,Anu Sheth; M Ravikumar; RV Hosur,Abstract The idea of J scaling along the ω 1 axis in two-dimensional correlated spectroscopyhas been extended to spin-echo-correlated spectroscopy (SECSY). A detailed theoreticalanalysis of the pulse scheme and the extent of sensitivity enhancement as a result of Jscaling has been given. The technique is shown to be particularly suitable for observation ofsmall coupling correlations since it avoids the use of refocusing delays prior to dataaquisition. Experimental spectra showing small coupling correlations of the order of 0.5 Hz;in J-scaled SECSY are presented.,Journal of Magnetic Resonance (1969),1986,13

Creation of zero-quantum coherences from equilibrium spin systems,M Ravikumar; Anu Sheth,Abstract It is demonstrated that zero-quantum coherence can be created by a single non-selective; pulse from equilibrium spin systems which are isotropically coupled. The zero-quantum coherence essentially arises from the mixing of states. A two-dimensional NMRpulse scheme is designed to observe the zero-quantum cross peaks in systems with smallscalar coupling constants by exploiting the relatively long transverse relaxation times of thezero-quantum coherence.,Chemical physics letters,1986,5
The effect of a single non-selective radiofrequency pulse on the creation of multiple quantum coherences and on coherence transfer,M Ravikumar,Abstract The creation of multiple-quantum coherences is not forbidden in experiments thatemploy a single non-selective radiofrequency pulse of arbitrary flip angle.

Data Processing,George C Levy; Deborah J Kerwood; Muppirala Ravikumar,Much of the progress in NMR spectroscopy over the past 50 years has rested on significantadvances in instrumentation and computer hardware and software technologies. There hasbeen an extraordinary transition from the early NMR instruments to today's modern systems.In the mid-1990s; NMR spectrometers are based on multiple computers; mostly tightlycoupled; and associated peripherals and smart devices. Software available for control ofmodern day NMR experiments; and for processing and analysis of the results of thoseexperiments; has reached sophistication that could not be anticipated a decade ago. It isanticipated that; near the turn of the century; NMR instrumentation itself may become trulyintelligent; assisting scientists in performing complicated analysis of molecular structuresand other applications. Parallel to the developments in NMR spectroscopy have been …,eMagRes,1996,1
Incorporation of temporally correlated internal motions into the magnetic resonance relaxation treatment while considering interference of different relaxation mecha...,Muppirala Ravikumar,Abstract Temporally correlated internal motions are incorporated into the magneticresonance relaxation treatment; taking into account the interference between two differentmechanisms of relaxation. The joint probability density function due to two differentstochastic processes responsible for spin relaxation is approximated in terms of theindividual probability density functions. A parameter indicative of the degree of temporalcorrelation between the two processes is introduced. Such a parameter of dynamicsprovides a way of observing and analyzing temporally correlated internal motions inmacromolecules. This is important in biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acidswhere the temporally correlated internal motions play a significant role in their function.Expressions for cross-correlation spectral densities are given for some common …,Chemical Physics Letters,2000,*
Erratum: Relaxation and dynamics of coupled spin systems subjected to continuous radio frequency fields [J. Chem. Phys. 9 5; 3092 (1991)],Muppirala Ravikumar; Rajesh Shukla; Aksel A Bothner‐By,In Table I; p. 3094; all entries in the second and third sections should be preceded by aminus sign. Also in Table I; in the first section; the elements connecting a {3;{3a to {3a; a {3and {3a; a {3 to a {3;{3a should be 2jo rather than o. This could cause an observabledifference in the relaxation of the zero quantum coherence if the zero quantum transitionfrequency is small compared to the relaxation rate. Professor BD Nageswara Rao haspointed out to us that the two methods; one used by him and one suggested by us; forintroducing the trace relationship in the calculation of the steady-state density matrix aremathematically equivalent and should give identical results. We agree; and ascribe thedifferent results obtained by us to round off error in the computational algorithms used.,The Journal of Chemical Physics,1992,*
Origin of primitive cells I: Biochemical evolution within bilayer lipid vesicles,G Naresh Kumar; M Ravi Kumar,Stable BLVs are not sufficient for biochemical evolution to occur. Necessary conditions for biochemicalevolution to take place in BLVs could be stated as (1) the BLVs should have substances whichcan undergo oxidation; reduction and catalyse group transfer reactions. They should also havechemical catalysts; which can be easily formed. (2) The environment of the BLVs should containan easily accessible carbon source in abundance. (3) The BLVs should contain molecules whichcan facilitate transport of small molecules and ions … We describe biochemical evolution inBLVs as initiated by oxidation of glycerol. The early stages of biochemical evolution are directedby the redox reactions that glycerol undergoes and further reactions amongst the various productsof glycerol oxidation (Active Hydrogen molecule (AH); high energy phosphate (HEP) andintermediates/products). This kind of evolution can progress as there is continuous influx …,Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres,1986,*
Origin of primitive cells II: A physico-chemical pathway to the evolution of primitive genetic apparatus,M Ravi Kumar; G Naresh Kumar,In this paper we describe the evolution of macromolecules and macromolecular synthesisingmachinery (primitive genetic apparatus) in the biochemically evolved BLVs. This pathway forthe evolution of these constituents is directed by physiochemieal principles. We argue that allpeptides that formed were directed by substrate-amino acid interactions and that these peptideswere functional; in the sense that they were involved in some aspect of catalysis and were about20-40 residues long. The one-to-one correspondence between the nucleic acids and these functionalpeptides (the Genetic Code) was established by the interaction of aminoacids and anticodonictriplet ribonucleotides. This amino acid-anticodon interaction directed the formation of ribonueleicacids ((-) strand) on the template of functional peptides; which was a significant step in the developmentof a primitive genetic apparatus. The complementary (+) strand was produced by …,Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres,1986,*
