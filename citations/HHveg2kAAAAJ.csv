Deep ultraviolet photoluminescence of water-soluble self-passivated graphene quantum dots,Libin Tang; Rongbin Ji; Xiangke Cao; Jingyu Lin; Hongxing Jiang; Xueming Li; Kar Seng Teng; Chi Man Luk; Songjun Zeng; Jianhua Hao; Shu Ping Lau,Glucose-derived water-soluble crystalline graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with an averagediameter as small as 1.65 nm (∼ 5 layers) were prepared by a facile microwave-assistedhydrothermal method. The GQDs exhibits deep ultraviolet (DUV) emission of 4.1 eV; whichis the shortest emission wavelength among all the solution-based QDs. The GQDs exhibittypical excitation wavelength-dependent properties as expected in carbon-based quantumdots. However; the emission wavelength is independent of the size of the GQDs. The uniqueoptical properties of the GQDs are attributed to the self-passivated layer on the surface of theGQDs as revealed by electron energy loss spectroscopy. The photoluminescence quantumyields of the GQDs were determined to be 7–11%. The GQDs are capable of converting bluelight into white light when the GQDs are coated onto a blue light emitting diode.,ACS nano,2012,770
Soft-mode hardening in SrTiO 3 thin films,AA Sirenko; C Bernhard; A Golnik; Anna M Clark; Jianhua Hao; Weidong Si; XX Xi,Abstract Understanding the behaviour of the dielectric constant in ferroelectric thin filmsremains a challenging problem. These ferroelectric materials have high static dielectricconstants; and so are important for their applications in high-storage-density capacitorstructures such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM) 1. But the dielectric constanttends to be significantly reduced in thin films; thereby limiting the potential benefit offerroelectrics for memory devices 2. Extensive studies have shown that this phenomenoncould be caused by a 'dead layer'of very low dielectric constant between the ferroeletric filmand the electrode 2; 3. And; although very few direct measurements are in fact available; ithas been recognized that the lattice dynamical properties in the thin films should also play akey role in the reduction 2 of the dielectric constant. Here we report far-infrared …,Nature,2000,248

Although low-dimensionalnanostructures are relatively flexible; the reported tunability of the band gap is within 100meV per 1% strain. It is also challenging to control strains in atomically thin semiconductorsprecisely and monitor the optical and phonon properties simultaneously. Here; wedeveloped an electromechanical device that can apply biaxial compressive strain to trilayerMoS2 supported by a piezoelectric substrate and covered by a transparent grapheneelectrode. Photoluminescence and Raman characterizations show that the direct band gapcan be blue-shifted for∼ 300 meV per 1% strain.

Magnetic and luminescent properties of multifunctional GdF 3: Eu 3+ nanoparticles,Hon-Tung Wong; Helen LW Chan; JH Hao,Multifunctional GdF 3: Eu 3+ nanoparticles were synthesized using a hydrothermal method.Photoluminescent excitation and emission spectra; and lifetime were measured. Theaverage lifetime of the nanoparticles is about 11 ms. The nanoparticle exhibitsparamagnetism at both 293 and 77 K; ascribing to noninteracting localized nature of themagnetic moment in the compound.

The energy gap values ofthe as-grown films and those annealed at 600\r {} C and 900\r {} C were found to be 4.75;4.48 and 4.44 eV; respectively. Films containing Eu 3+ and Tb 3+ exhibited red and greencathodoluminescence (CL); respectively. The CL of Ga 2 O 3: Tm mainly showed a broadband in the blue-green region; which resulted from the emission by both the Ga 2 O 3 hostand Tm 3+.

Cathodoluminescence of rare-earth-doped zinc aluminate films,Zhidong Lou; Jianhua Hao,Abstract Eu-; Tb-; and Tm-doped zinc aluminate (ZnAl 2 O 4) thin film phosphors wereprepared by the spray pyrolysis technique at an ambient pressure. The effects of preparationconditions on the cathodoluminescence properties of the films were studied. Filmscontaining Tb 3+ and Tm 3+ ions exhibited green and blue cathodoluminescence;respectively.

The low-voltage cathodoluminescence of LaF 3: Eu due to D 5 0→ F 71 and D 5 0→ F 7 2 transitions was found to be sensitive to the site that Eu 3+ ions occupied.The luminous efficiency of LaF 3: Ce 3+; Tb 3+ with green emission is improved from 1.53 to2.02 lm/W compared with LaF 3: Tb 3+; due to the energy transfer processes from Ce 3+ toTb 3+ ions.

Experimental data for electric-field-induced hardening of the soft modes and the tuning of the static dielectric constant are inagreement described by the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller formalism. The markedly differentbehavior of the soft modes in thin films from that in the bulk is explained by the existence oflocal polar regions.,Physical review letters,2000,94

Piezo‐phototronic effect‐induced dual‐mode light and ultrasound emissions from ZnS: Mn/PMN–PT thin‐film structures,Yang Zhang; Guanyin Gao; Helen LW Chan; Jiyan Dai; Yu Wang; Jianhua Hao,The phenomenon of electroluminescence (EL) has attracted an ever-increasing demand forapplications throughout the illumination and display industries.[1–5] In EL devices; lightgeneration in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is mostly investigated for flat-panel display andlight sources due to their high brightness; long lives; and low power consumption.[6–9] It iswell-known that the LED is essentially ap–n junction diode typically made from asemiconductor. The light emission is generated by the direct injection and subsequentrecombination of electron–hole pairs in the forward-biased p–n junction.[10] Thephenomenon of light emission from electron–hole pair recombination as a result of minoritycarrier injection is regarded as injection EL. It is somewhat surprising that very limited workon exploiting EL devices beyond the p–n junction structure has been reported in recent …,Advanced Materials,2012,66
In vitro cell imaging using multifunctional small sized KGdF 4: Yb 3+; Er 3+ upconverting nanoparticles synthesized by a one-pot solvothermal process,Hon-Tung Wong; Ming-Kiu Tsang; Chi-Fai Chan; Ka-Leung Wong; Bin Fei; Jianhua Hao,Multifunctional KGdF4: 18% Yb3+; 2% Er3+ nanoparticles with upconversion fluorescenceand paramagnetism are synthesized. The average sizes of the nanoparticles capped withbranched polyethyleneimine (PEI) and 6-aminocaproic acid (6AA) are∼ 14 and∼ 13 nm;respectively. Our KGdF4 host does not exhibit any phase change with the decrease ofparticle size; which can prevent the detrimental significant decrease in upconversionluminescence caused by this effect observed in the well-known NaYF4 host. The branchedPEI and 6AA capping ligands endow our nanoparticles with water-dispersibility andbiocompatibility; which can favor internalization of our nanoparticles into the cytoplasm ofHeLa cells and relatively high cell viability. The strong upconversion luminescence detectedat the cytoplasm of HeLa cells incubated with the branched PEI-capped nanoparticles is …,Nanoscale,2013,63
Electroluminescence of europium-doped gallium oxide thin films,Jianhua Hao; Zhidong Lou; Ian Renaud; Michael Cocivera,Abstract Electroluminescence (EL) was observed in Ga 2 O 3: Eu thin films prepared byusing spray pyrolysis of aqueous solutions. The strongest line was associated with the 5 D0→ 7 F 2 electronic transition for Eu 3+. The red emission of the films had chromaticitycoordinates of x= 0.643 and y= 0.356 with a dominant wavelength of 605 nm and a colorpurity of 99%. The luminance changed with the crystallinity and a quenching effect occurred.The spray pyrolysis process; which eliminates high vacuum apparatus; may be moreattractive from the point of view of large-scale and large-area production ofelectroluminescent devices.,Thin Solid Films,2004,63

Tuning the luminescence of phosphors: beyond conventional chemical method,Gongxun Bai; Ming‐Kiu Tsang; Jianhua Hao,Abstract Tuning the luminescence of phosphors is extremely important in controlling andprocessing light for active components of light sources; optical sensing; display devices; andbiomedicine. So far; conventional chemical approaches have routinely been employed tomodify the luminescence during the phosphor's synthesis. It is interesting to broaden themodulation of luminescence by physical methods; such as electric field; magnetic field;mechanical stress; temperature; photons; ionizing radiation; and so on. Since some physicalmethods may provide unusual routes to tune the luminescence in in-situ; real-time;dynamical and reversible manners; it should be beneficial for our understanding thefundamentals of luminescence and widespread applications in a variety of advanced opticalmaterials and devices.

The prepared films were stored in pure N 2 at room temperature orannealed in pure O 2 at room temperature; 45 C; 65 C and 85 C for 12 hours prior to thedeposition of the metal electrodes. It is found that annealing in O 2 leads to substantialincrease in the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the devices. Furthermore; strongdependence on the annealing temperature for the PCEs of the devices suggests that athermally activated process may underlie the observed phenomenon. It is believed that theannealing process may facilitate the diffusion of O 2 into the spiro-MeOTAD for inducing p-doping of the hole transport material. Furthermore; the process can result in lowering the …,Scientific reports,2014,59
Layer‐Dependent Nonlinear Optical Properties and Stability of Non‐Centrosymmetric Modification in Few‐Layer GaSe Sheets,Wenjing Jie; Xi Chen; Dian Li; Lu Xie; Yeung Yu Hui; Shu Ping Lau; Xiaodong Cui; Jianhua Hao,Abstract Gallium selenide; an important second-order nonlinear semiconductor; hasreceived much scientific interest. However; the nonlinear properties in its two-dimensional(2D) form are still unknown. A strong second harmonic generation (SHG) in bilayer andmultilayer GaSe sheets is reported. This is also the first observation of SHG on 2D GaSe thinlayers. The SHG of multilayer GaSe above five layers shows a quadratic dependence on thethickness; while that of a sheet thinner than five layers shows a cubic dependence. Thediscrepancy between the two SHG responses is attributed to the weakened stability of non-centrosymmetric GaSe in the atomically thin flakes where a layer–layer stacking order tendsto favor centrosymmetric modification. Importantly; two-photon excited fluorescence has alsobeen observed in the GaSe sheets. Our free-energy calculations based on first-principles …,Angewandte Chemie International Edition,2015,58
Green; blue; and yellow cathodoluminescence of Ba 2 B 5 O 9 Cl thin-films doped with Tb 3+; Tm 3+; and Mn 2+,Jianhua Hao; J Gao; Michael Cocivera,Green; blue; and yellow cathodoluminescence (CL) have been obtained for thin-films of Ba2 B 5 O 9 Cl doped with Tb 3+; Tm 3+; and Mn 2+; respectively. These phosphor films weredeposited by spray pyrolysis; and then activated in air at temperatures suitable for use onglass substrates. The CL characteristic peaks of the films correspond to transitions betweenelectronic energy levels of Tm 3+; Tb 3+; and Mn 2+ ions. The chromaticity coordinates;dominant wavelength; and color purity were determined for each phosphor. Saturationeffects were observed as the beam current density increased. The more severe currentsaturation of Mn-doped film may be due to a greater ground state deplection of Mnluminescent centers than that of the Tb and Tm.,Applied physics letters,2003,58
Tuning of the blue emission from europium-doped alkaline earth chloroborate thin films activated in air,Jianhua Hao; J Gao; Michael Cocivera,Thin films of M 2 B 5 O 9 Cl: Eu (M= Ca; Sr; Ba) were prepared on glass substrates usingspray pyrolysis. Blue cathodoluminescence due to the abnormal reduction of Eu 3+→ Eu 2+was obtained by annealing films in air. The cation of the host lattice was found to affect theeffectiveness of the reduction process; which could result in influencing the emission band.By selecting types and composition of alkaline cation; it was possible to tune the dominantemitting wavelength between 435 to 465 nm. Activation of the films occurred at temperaturessuitable for the use of glass substrates.,Applied physics letters,2003,56
Abnormal reduction of Eu ions and luminescence in Ca B 2 O 4: Eu thin films,JH Hao; J Gao,Thin films of Ca B 2 O 4: Eu were deposited on glass substrates by spray pyrolysis. Theabnormal reduction of Eu 3+ to Eu 2+ in as-grown thin films was found at the growthtemperatures from 300 to 500° C. Blue cathodoluminescence was observed by annealingfilms in air; correlating with further abnormal reduction of Eu ions and crystallization ofcompounds. These phenomena were explained by an electron transfer mechanism. Thechromaticity coordinates were x= 0.193 and y= 0.089 with a dominant wavelength of 455nm. Our results indicate calcium borate doped with Eu is a blue phosphor at temperaturessuitable for the use of glass substrates in flat panel applications.,Applied physics letters,2004,55

High-quality water-soluble amine-functionalized BaYF5: Yb/Er NPs with an average size of 24 nmwere synthesized by a facile environmentally friendly hydrothermal method for simultaneoussynthesis and surface functionalization. Structure investigation based on the Rietveldrefinement method revealed that the as-synthesized BaYF5: Yb/Er NPs present a cubicphase structure; which differs from the previously reported tetragonal structure.

Luminous and tunable white-light upconversion for YAG (Yb 3 Al 5 O 12) and (Yb; Y) 2 O 3 nanopowders,Jiwei Wang; Jian Hua Hao; Peter A Tanner,We report on multiphoton white-light upconversion in vacuum for Pechini synthesisYb_3Al_5O_12 (YbAG) and combustion synthesis (Yb; Y_2) O_3 nanopowders under IRexcitation. Their intense white-light upconversion is attributed to charge transferluminescence superimposed upon a broadband emission. Unlike common nanoscalephosphors; which show low luminescence efficiency; the intensity of white-lightupconversion for nanopowders is similar to that of their bulk counterparts. The luminaryefficacy of the upconversion is estimated to be 10–15lmW^− 1; and the CommissionInternationale d'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates can be widely tuned by the excitation power;pressure; and codoping ratio. The nano-YbAG sample exhibits a longer buildup time foremission; a higher excitation threshold; and a wider CIE range than the oxide …,Optics letters,2010,51
Interface structure and phase of epitaxial SrTiO 3 (110) thin films grown directly on silicon,JH Hao; J Gao; Z Wang; DP Yu,The interface structure and phase between SrTiO 3 (110) on Si (100) have beeninvestigated using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and x-ray photoelectronspectroscopy. The SrTiO 3∕ Si interface was found to be epitaxially crystallized without anyamorphous oxide layer. The formation of Sr silicate at the interface was suggested byconsidering the fact of the core-level spectra of the Si 2 p; O 1 s; and Sr 3 d. Our resultssuggest that the presence of a coincident site lattice at the interface between Si and a Srsilicate and/or SrTiO 3 may help to stabilize SrTiO 3 in the epitaxial orientation reported inthe work.,Applied Physics Letters,2005,49

In this work; we studied the optical properties of poly [(maleicanhydride)-alt-(vinyl acetate)](PMV); a pure oxygenic nonconjugated polymer and provedthat the origin of its emission was associated with the clustering of the locked carbonylgroups. PMV exhibits solvatochromism: after interaction with electron-rich solvents; itsabsorption and emission shift to the longer wavelength region due to the formation ofpolymer/solvent complexes. This enables fine-tuning of its optical property by varying the …,Macromolecules,2014,48

Dielectric properties of pulsed-laser-deposited calcium titanate thin films,Jianhua Hao; Weidong Si; XX Xi; Ruyan Guo; AS Bhalla; LE Cross,We have deposited CaTiO 3 thin films on SrRuO 3 electrode layers on SrTiO 3 and LaAlO 3substrates by pulsed laser deposition. The low-frequency dielectric properties weremeasured from 4 to 300 K. We found that the dielectric constants of 1-μm-thick CaTiO 3 filmsare very close to that observed in the bulk materials. The dielectric loss depends on thetemperature and is on the order of 10− 4 at low temperature. The dielectric constants of thefilms can be tuned by electric field by 6% at room temperature and 10% at 200 K.,Applied Physics Letters,2000,48

Dielectric loss and defect mode of SrTiO 3 thin films under direct-current bias,Chen Ang; LE Cross; Zhi Yu; Ruyan Guo; AS Bhalla; Jian Hua Hao,The dielectric behavior of SrTiO 3 thin films prepared by the pulsed-laser depositiontechnique on SrTiO 3 single-crystal substrates is studied under dc electric field. A highdielectric constant maximum ε max (∼ 2280) and a low-loss tan δ (∼ 0.001) are obtained.Compared with the observation in SrTiO 3 single crystals; an additional dielectric loss peakwith frequency dispersion is observed around 150 K (at 1 kHz). With increasing dc bias; thepeak is suppressed and finally disappears at∼ 350 kV/cm; however; the temperature atwhich the peak occurs is independent of electric field. The possible physical mechanism ofthe peak is briefly discussed.,Applied Physics Letters,2001,45

Most of the 2Dmaterials are served as hole transport layers in organic devices. Here; it is reported thatsolution exfoliated few layers black phosphorus (BP) can be served as an effective electrontransport layer (ETL) in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) for the first time. The power conversionefficiencies (PCEs) of the BP-incorporated OPVs can be improved to 8.18% in average withthe relative enhancement of 11%. The incorporation of BP flakes with the optimum thicknessof≈ 10 nm can form cascaded band structure in OPVs; which can facilitate electron transportand enhance the PCEs of the devices.

Blue cathodoluminescence due to the abnormal reduction of Eu 3+→ Eu2+ in as-grown thin films was observed at the growth temperatures from 140° C to 500° C.Significant line narrowing was found as the growth temperature increased. Using eitherconventional or rapid thermal annealing of thin films in air enhanced the transition of theemission spectrum from several peaks to a sharp single peak.

Microstructure and misfit relaxation in SrTiO 3/SrRuO 3 bilayer films on LaAlO 3 (100) substrates,JS Wu; CL Jia; K Urban; JH Hao; XX Xi,Abstract We studied the microstructure of SrTiO 3/SrRuO 3 bilayer films on (001) LaAlO 3substrates by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. At the SrRuO 3/LaAlO 3interface a defect configuration of stacking faults and nanotwins bounding either Frankpartial dislocations or Shockley partial dislocations and complex interaction between theseplanar defects were found to be the dominant means of misfit accommodation. The misfit inthe SrTiO 3/SrRuO 3 system; however; is mainly accommodated by elastic strain. Most of theobserved defects in the SrTiO 3 layer can be related to the [111] planar defects in the SrRuO3 layer propagating and reaching the SrTiO 3/SrRuO 3 interface. Furthermore; a [110] planardefect can also be introduced in the SrTiO 3 layer due to the structure change of the SrTiO3/SrRuO 3 interface.,Journal of materials research,2001,42
Graphene/gallium arsenide-based Schottky junction solar cells,Wenjing Jie; Fengang Zheng; Jianhua Hao,Chemical-vapor-deposited single-and bi-layer graphene sheets have been transferred onton-type GaAs substrates.

Cathodoluminescent characteristics of green-emitting ZnAl2O4: Mn thin-film phosphors,Z Lou; J Hao,Abstract Thin films of ZnAl 2 O 4: Mn were grown on aluminosilicate ceramic plates usingspray pyrolysis of aqueous solutions. The cathodoluminescence (CL) properties of the filmsunder low to medium excitation voltage (< 5 kV) were investigated.

The perovskite SrTiO 3 buffer layerpresent a body centered cubic structure by formation of an interfacial layer with the [100]SrTiO 3∥[110] GaAs in-plane relationship. Thereupon; a highly c-oriented BaTiO 3 thin filmwas grown on SrTiO 3/GaAs in a layer by layer mode. Enhanced electrical properties of theheteroepitaxial structure were demonstrated.

Structural and luminescent properties of gel-combustion synthesized green-emitting Ca3Sc2Si3O12: Ce3+ phosphor for solid-state lighting,Yuanhong Liu; Jianhua Hao; Weidong Zhuang; Yunsheng Hu,Abstract Ca 3 Sc 2 Si 3 O 12: Ce 3+ phosphors with a single phase and fine size weresuccessfully obtained at a lower temperature (1100 C) using the gel-combustion methodcompared with the conventional solid-state reaction method (about 1500 C). The crystalphase and the microstructure of the phosphors and their photoluminescence wereinvestigated. The particle size is about 1 µm; which is much less than that obtained by thesolid-state reaction. Smaller particle size can reduce internal scattering when particles aremixed with silicon and coated onto a blue light-emitting diode (LED). A bright greenemission is observed; which is attributed to the characteristic emissions from 5d–2 F 5/2 and5d–2 F 7/2 transitions of Ce 3+.

Mapping live cell viscosity with an aggregation‐induced emission fluorogen by means of two‐photon fluorescence lifetime imaging,Sijie Chen; Yuning Hong; Yan Zeng; Qiqi Sun; Yang Liu; Engui Zhao; Gongxun Bai; Jianan Qu; Jianhua Hao; Ben Zhong Tang,Abstract Intracellular viscosity is a crucial parameter that indicates the functioning of cells. Inthis work; we demonstrate the utility of TPE-Cy; a cell-permeable dye with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) property; in mapping the viscosity inside live cells. Owing to the AIEcharacteristics; both the fluorescence intensity and lifetime of this dye are increased alongwith an increase in viscosity. Fluorescence lifetime imaging of live cells stained with TPE-Cyreveals that the lifetime in lipid droplets is much shorter than that from the generalcytoplasmic region. The loose packing of the lipids in a lipid droplet results in low viscosityand thus shorter lifetime of TPE-Cy in this region. It demonstrates that the AIE dye couldprovide good resolution in intracellular viscosity sensing. This is also the first work in whichAIE molecules are applied in fluorescence lifetime imaging and intracellular viscosity …,Chemistry-A European Journal,2015,37

By control of dopant concentrations;the lanthanide-doped BTO powders are capable of generating various UC spectra and colortunability. A white-light emission is achieved through an optimal design. Strong UCluminescence is also observed in the lanthanide-doped BTO thin-films grown onPt/TiO2/SiO2/Si substrate; which can retain well-defined hysteresis loops with a remnantpolarization (2 Pr) of 17.8 μ C/cm2.

By lining up a set of lanthanide ions with matched energy levels ina core–shell nanostructure; we demonstrate well-defined cascades of energy transfer thatgives access to optical emissions from a large collection of lanthanide ions (Tb3+; Eu3+;Dy3+; Sm3+; Nd3+; Yb3+; and Er3+) after excitation into a common sensitizer of Ce3+featuring a broad absorption. Through optimization of the nanoparticle structure and surfacecoating; high quantum yields of up to 90% are achieved.

Optical response of single‐crystal (La; Ca) MnOδ thin films,JH Hao; XT Zeng; HK Wong,(La; Ca) MnOδ thin film can be used as a bolometer operated over a wide temperaturerange around its metal–semiconductor transition where its resistance (R) changes rapidly.This material has a high optical absorption coefficient over a broad wavelength range and ischemically stable in air. We measured the optical response of single‐crystal (La; Ca) MnOδthin films to a He–Ne laser (632.8 nm) as a function of temperature (T); light modulationfrequency (f); bias current (I); and laser power (P). The temperature dependence of themeasured signal follows the dR/dT curve and the signal depends linearly on I and P. Theseresults indicate that the response is mainly bolometric. Room temperature operation ispossible if the sample composition and oxygen stoichiometry are adjusted appropriately.,Journal of applied physics,1996,35

The short-circuit current of Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample is2.56 mA cm− 2; about 50 times greater than that of Pt/PZT/ITO/glass sample. The energylevel of the a-Si film is well matched with that of PZT film; which is beneficial to the transportof UV-visible light-induced charges in the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample. The photovoltaicoutput can be tuned by changing the dopant type of the a-Si film; and the maximumphotoelectric conversion efficiency is measured to be up to 1.25% in the PZT film with an n-type a-Si film (phosphorus doped).,Journal of Materials Chemistry A,2014,34
Rational molecular design for achieving persistent and efficient pure organic room-temperature phosphorescence,Weijun Zhao; Zikai He; Jacky WY Lam; Qian Peng; Huili Ma; Zhigang Shuai; Gongxun Bai; Jianhua Hao; Ben Zhong Tang,Summary Manipulation of the emission properties of pure organic room-temperaturephosphors through molecular design is attractive but challenging. Tremendous efforts havebeen made to modulate their aggregation behaviors to suppress nonradiative decay in orderto achieve efficient light emission and long lifetimes. However; success has been limited. Toattain such a goal; here we present a rational design principle based on intrinsic molecular-structure engineering. Comprehensive investigations on the molecular orbitals revealed thatan excited state with hybrid (n; π*) and (π; π*) configurations in appreciable proportion isdesired. Tailoring the aromatic subunits in arylphenones can effectively tune the energylevel and the orbital feature of the triplet exciton. Our experimental data reveal that a seriesof full-color pure organic phosphors with a balanced lifetime (up to 0.23 s) and efficiency …,Chem,2016,32

By controlling the size of the nanocrystals; the infraredluminescence is tunable. It could be ascribed to alteration of the crystal field strength Dq ofoctahedral Ni 2+; which is due to the changes of the lattice parameters.

At the SrRuO 3/LaAlO 3interface we frequently observe dissociated superdislocations in connection withRuddlesden–Popper-type planar defects. These superdislocations can contribute to misfitrelaxation equivalent to a perfect misfit dislocation with Burgers vector a< 1 1 0>. Theformation and the geometry of this defect arrangement is discussed in detail. The Sr-richRuddlesden–Popper-defect can be introduced by composition fluctuations during filmdeposition. It can be concluded that it can act as a source for the generation of misfitdislocations.,Journal of crystal growth,2002,20

Dielectric properties of Ba 0.6 Sr 0.4 Ti O 3 thin films using Pb 0.3 Sr 0.7 Ti O 3 buffer layers,Sheng-Xiang Wang; Jian-Hua Hao; Zhen-Ping Wu; Dan-Yang Wang; Yue Zhuo; Xing-Zhong Zhao,Ba 0.6 Sr 0.4 Ti O 3 (BST) thin films buffered with Pb 0.3 Sr 0.7 Ti O 3 (PST) at each side ofthe interface contact with electrodes (PST/BST/PST) were deposited on Pt∕ Ti∕ Si O 2∕ Sisubstrates. The dielectric properties of the films were measured using planar Pt∕ PST∕BST∕ PST∕ Pt∕ Ti∕ Si O 2∕ Si capacitor structures. The existence of a PST layerbetween the BST and Pt electrode can improve the dielectric properties of the BST film.

The films showed a∼ 31.7% tunability of the permittivity at anapplied bias field of 0.85 MV∕ cm. This suggests that such films have potential applicationsfor integrated device applications.,Applied Physics Letters,2007,19
Rectifying characteristics and transport behavior of Sr Ti O 3− δ (110)∕ p-Si (100) heterojunctions,Zhi Luo; JH Hao; J Gao,Introducing oxygen vacancy causes the dielectric insulator Sr Ti O 3 to evolve to an-typesemiconductor. The authors have fabricated n-Sr Ti O 3− δ (110)∕ p-Si (100)heterojunctions; showing clear rectifying characteristics at different temperatures from 100 to292 K. A forward-to-reverse bias ratio of about 1200 was found at V=±2 V for the pn junctionoperated at T= 292 K. The current-voltage characteristic follows I∝ exp (e V∕ η k T) for thepn junction at relatively low forward-bias voltage; while the relation of I∼ V 1.9 describes thetransport behavior of pn junction at relatively high forward-bias voltage.

Conservative antiphase boundary in SrTiO 3 films on LaAlO 3 substrates with SrRuO 3 buffer layers,JS Wu; CL Jia; K Urban; JH Hao; XX Xi,We have studied the microstructure of SrTiO 3 films on LaAlO 3 substrates with the SrRuO 3buffer layer using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. While high density ofdefects due to lattice mismatch were found at the SrRuO 3/LaAlO 3 interface; no misfitdislocation was observed at the SrTiO 3/SrRuO 3 interface. The {111} stacking fault in theSrRuO 3 buffer layer propagates into the SrTiO 3 film; giving rise to a type of antiphaseboundary on the {110} plane with a crystallographic shear vector of a/2< 001>. Theboundary is a conservative one which does not lead to any charge defects. A model basedon dislocation interactions is proposed to explain the generation mechanism of theantiphase boundary.,Journal of Applied Physics,2001,19
Comparative studies of upconversion luminescence characteristics and cell bioimaging based on one-step synthesized upconversion nanoparticles capped with diff...,Ming-Kiu Tsang; Chi-Fai Chan; Ka-Leung Wong; Jianhua Hao,Abstract Herein; three types of upconverting NaGdF 4: Yb/Er nanoparticles (UCNPs) havebeen synthesized via one-step hydrothermal synthesis with polyethylene glycol (PEG);polyethylenimine (PEI) and 6-aminocapronic acid (6AA) functionalization.

Ultra‐Broadband Near‐Infrared Luminescence of Ni2+: ZnO–Al2O3–SiO2 Nanocomposite Glasses Prepared by Sol–Gel Method,Shifeng Zhou; Jianhua Hao; Jianrong Qiu,Abstract We have studied the synthesis and near-infrared luminescent properties of Ni 2+-doped ZnO–Al 2 O 3–SiO 2 nanocomposite glasses embedded activated spinelnanocrystals prepared using a sol–gel technique. Nanocrystal-dependent optical propertiesin Ni 2+-doped nanocomposite glasses were systematically investigated. We found that Ni2+ ion is optically active only in the composite embedded nanocrystals; which can provideoctahedral position with appropriate crystal field strength. Near-infrared emission rangingfrom 1100 to 1600 nm was observed in the Ni 2+-doped composite fabricated by sol–gelmethod. Such an ultra-broadband luminescence from the nanocomposite could cover theinfrared emission bands obtained from multiple rare earth ions (Ho 3+; Pr 3+; and Tm 3+)doped glasses.,Journal of the American Ceramic Society,2011,17

Large tuning of near-infrared (NIR) photoluminescence isachieved by chemical substitution due to the variation in the crystal field acting on Ni2+doping ions. The prepared materials show ultrabroadband NIR luminescence; from 1100 nmto over 1600 nm. The peak position of the NIR emission can be finely tuned; and a total shiftof 269 nm was observed. The mechanism behind the observation is discussed; theinterestingly tunable luminescence originates from a change in the specific structure of theferroelectric matrix.,Journal of Materials Chemistry C,2014,16

Aggregation‐Induced Emission Rotors: Rational Design and Tunable Stimuli Response,Jie Li; Yang Zhang; Ju Mei; Jacky WY Lam; Jianhua Hao; Ben Zhong Tang,Abstract A novel molecular design strategy is provided to rationally tune the stimuli responseof luminescent materials with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics. A series ofnew AIE-active molecules (AIE rotors) are prepared by covalently linking different numbersof tetraphenylethene moieties together. Upon gradually increasing the number of rotatablephenyl rings; the sensitivity of the response of the AIE rotors to viscosity and temperature issignificantly enhanced. Although the molecular size is further enlarged; the performance isonly slightly improved due to slightly increased effective rotors; but with largely increasedrotational barriers. Such molecular engineering and experimental results offer more in-depthinsight into the AIE mechanism; namely; restriction of intramolecular rotations.

Agspecies play dual functions. The mechanism of the enhancement is discussed in depthcombing the energy transfer from Ag+; molecular-like; nonplasmonic Ag species; Bi3+ andBi2+ to near-infrared bismuth active centers; and the redox reaction of Bi species with Agspecies.

Theeffects of strain on the microstructures; domain morphologies and ferroelectric properties ofBaTiO 3 thin films were studied systematically. Ferroelectric properties in a 40-nm-thickBaTiO 3 film were suppressed owing to a reduced tetragonality induced by the strainbetween BaTiO 3 and the underlying CoFe 2 O 4.

Laser molecular beam epitaxy growth and properties of SrTiO3 thin films for microelectronic applications,JH Hao; J Gao; HK Wong,Abstract Dielectric SrTiO 3 thin films were deposited on LaAlO 3 and Si substrates usinglaser molecular beam epitaxy. The correlations between the deposition parameters of SrTiO3 thin films; their structural characteristics; and dielectric properties were studied. Theconditions for achieving epitaxial SrTiO 3 thin films were found to be limited to depositionconditions such as deposition temperature.

Effect of biaxial strain induced by piezoelectric PMN-PT on the upconversion photoluminescence of BaTiO 3: Yb/Er thin films,Zhenping Wu; Yang Zhang; Gongxun Bai; Weihua Tang; Ju Gao; Jianhua Hao,Thin films of Yb^ 3+/Er^ 3+ co-doped BaTiO_3 (BTO: Yb/Er) have been epitaxially grown onpiezoelectric Pb (Mg_1/3Nb_2/3) _0. 7Ti_0. 3O_3 (PMN-PT) substrates. Biaxial strain canbe effectively controlled by applying electric field on PMN-PT substrate. A reversible; in situand dynamic modification of upconversion photoluminescence in BTO: Yb/Er film wasobserved via converse piezoelectric effect. Detailed analysis and in situ X-ray diffractionindicate that such modulations are possibly due to the change in the lattice deformation ofthe thin films.

Near-infrared-to-near-infrared down-shifting and upconversion luminescence of KY3F10 with single dopant of Nd3+ ion,Huihong Lin; Ting Yu; Ming-Kiu Tsang; Gongxun Bai; Qinyuan Zhang; Jianhua Hao,We have studied the structural and near-infrared (NIR) luminescent properties of KY3F10phosphors; singly doped with Nd 3+ serving as both sensitizer and activator. With a singlelaser diode at the wavelength of 808 nm as a pump source; simultaneous NIR-to-NIRupconversion (UC) and down-shifting (DS) emissions are effectively achieved; due to thespecific energy levels of Nd 3+ dopant and the low phonon energy of the host.

The transition temperature T c in oxygendeficient thin films increases with increasing light intensity. The photoinduced effect in fullyoxidized thin films is in sharp contrast to that observed in the oxygen deficient samples. Thiseffect relaxes back within several days at room temperature.

Colossal permittivity of (Mg+ Nb) co-doped TiO 2 ceramics with low dielectric loss,Chao Yang; Mei-Yan Tse; Xianhua Wei; Jianhua Hao,A high dielectric loss is one of the difficulties that hinder the application of colossalpermittivity (CP) materials. Here we report the CP behaviors in ceramics of rutile (Mg+ Nb)co-doped TiO2; ie;(Mg1/3Nb2/3) xTi1− xO2. The room-temperature dielectric properties ofthe pure homogenous ceramics include a relatively high CP (> 104) and an acceptabledielectric loss (< 0.1) at frequencies from 102 to 105 Hz in the doping concentration range of0.5% to 7%. In particular; an excellent low dielectric loss of 0.0083 and a high dielectricpermittivity of 3.87× 104 at 1 kHz were obtained for the 1% doped sample. Moreover; thetemperature stability (room temperature∼ 180° C) and frequency stability (102–105 Hz) ofthe CP properties were studied. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggests that the superiorCP properties could be explained by the electron-pinned defect-dipole mechanism.,Journal of Materials Chemistry C,2017,9

Photoluminescent and low-voltage cathodoluminescent blue-emitting phosphors with high colour purity,HL Li; HLW Chan; JH Hao,Abstract Tungstate phosphor synthesized by a polyol method exhibits characteristicemission of Tm 3+ in the blue region when excited either by ultraviolet light or by a low-voltage electron beam. The emission at 453 nm predominates in both spectra; which isattributed to the exceptionally large probability of transition 1 D 2→ 3 F 4. In thephotoluminescence and cathodoluminescence spectra; this blue-emitting phosphor haschromaticity coordinates (0.1556; 0.0316) with a dominant wavelength of 455 nm and(0.1498; 0.0383) with a dominant wavelength of 460 nm; respectively.

The films are compatible withvarious types of substrates; including conventional dielectrics (LaAlO_3; silica) andsemiconductors (Si; GaAs). The emission peak position of the films can be finely tuned bychanging oxygen partial pressure during the deposition; while the excitation wavelengthlocates from ultra-violet to near-infrared regions.

Both solution casting and melt compoundingapproaches were tried with a range of BBS concentrations; and an optimal concentration of0.5% was selected to investigate the mechanochromic mechanism in detail. When the blendfilm was stretched up to 100%; its emission peaks at 475 and 413 nm changed in intensityratio from 6.3 to 1.8. When it was released; both the film size and emission peaks largelyrecovered. By a short annealing at 120° C; their full recovery was achieved.

Ion-implantation induced nano distortion layer and its influence on nonlinear optical properties of ZnO single crystals,CC Zheng; SJ Xu; JQ Ning; YN Chen; XH Lu; C-C Ling; CM Che; GY Gao; JH Hao; G Brauer; W Anwand,Second harmonic generation (SHG) and X-ray diffraction rocking curves of high-quality ZnOsingle crystals implanted by different ions (He; Cu; and Zn) were investigated. Interestingly; itwas found that both He-and Zn-implanted samples show a convinced increment in SHGefficiency while the Cu-implanted one does not. X-ray diffraction rocking curves of thesamples show satellite structures; and the simulations firmly reveal the formation of quasi-interfaces inside He-and Zn-implanted crystals. These quasi-interfaces lead to SHGimprovement in the two samples. Polarization dependence of SHG of the samples on theexcitation light also evidences this conclusion.,Journal of applied physics,2011,8
In situ growth of blue-emitting thin films of cerium-doped barium chloride hydrate at low temperatures,Jianhua Hao; Zhidong Lou; Michael Cocivera,Blue emission was observed from thin films of barium chloride hydrate doped with cerium.The films were deposited by spray pyrolysis of aqueous solutions with substratetemperatures between 250 and 450° C. The cathodoluminescence (CL) spectrum consistsof two peaks at 443 and 485 nm due to 4f-5d transitions of cerium ion.

Observation of room-temperature magnetoresistance in monolayer MoS2 by ferromagnetic gating,Wenjing Jie; Zhibin Yang; Fan Zhang; Gongxun Bai; Chi Wah Leung; Jianhua Hao,Room-temperature magnetoresistance (MR) effect is observed in heterostructures of wafer-scale MoS2 layers and ferromagnetic dielectric CoFe2O4 (CFO) thin films. Through theferromagnetic gating; an MR ratio of− 12.7% is experimentally achieved in monolayer MoS2under 90 kOe magnetic field at room temperature (RT). The observed MR ratio is muchhigher than that in previously reported nonmagnetic metal coupled with ferromagneticinsulator; which generally exhibited MR ratio of less than 1%. The enhanced MR is attributedto the spin accumulation at the heterostructure interface and spin injection to the MoS2layers by the strong spin–orbit coupling effect. The injected spin can contribute to the spincurrent and give rise to the MR by changing the resistance of MoS2 layers. Furthermore; theMR effect decreases as the thickness of MoS2 increases; and the MR ratio becomes …,ACS nano,2017,7

Anomalous second ferromagnetic phase transition as a signature of spinodal decomposition in Fe-doped GeTe diluted magnetic semiconductor,F Tong; JH Hao; ZP Chen; GY Gao; H Tong; XS Miao,Structural and magnetic properties of diluted magnetic semiconductor Ge 1-xFexTe thin filmsare investigated. The conventional structure analysis shows c-axis orientation with columnargrowth of the films and no indication of Fe clusters or second phase.

X-ray-Activated Near-Infrared Persistent Luminescent Probe for Deep-Tissue and Renewable in Vivo Bioimaging,Zhenluan Xue; Xiaolong Li; Youbin Li; Mingyang Jiang; Hongrong Liu; Songjun Zeng; Jianhua Hao,Near-infrared (NIR) persistent luminescence nanoparticles (PLNPs) are considered as newalternative optical probes due to being free of autofluorescence; benefited from the self-sustained emission after excitation and high signal-to-noise ratio. However; the NIR-emittedPLNPs always present a short decay time and require excitation by ultraviolet or visible lightwith a short penetrable depth; remarkably hindering their applications for in vivo long-termtracking and imaging. Therefore; it is important to develop NIR-emitted PLNPs with in vivoactivation nature by new excitation sources with deeper penetrating depths. Here; wepropose a new type of X-ray-activated ZnGa2O4: Cr PLNPs (X-PLNPs) with efficient NIRpersistent emission and rechargeable activation features; in which both the excitation andemission possess a high penetrable nature in vivo.

In MRI; conventional contrast agents are generally employed separately in asingle type of MRI.

Method for epitaxial growth of (110)-oriented SrTiO3 thin films on silicon without template,*,A process and structure utilizes pulsed laser deposition technique to grow SrTiO3 (STO)films with single (110) out-of-plane orientation upon a surface of all (100);(110) and (111)-oriented silicon (Si) substrates.

The blue phosphors in this studywere activated in air at temperatures suitable for glass substrates; which have been used ina number of applications. The effects of rare earth ions and oxide hosts on the blue-light-emitting properties of phosphors are discussed. In addition; novel blue-light emission wasobserved in certain typical undoped wide bandgap oxides.

Theluminescence properties are tightly correlated with the crystal structure of the host BST. Theluminescence variations are mainly affected by phase transition induced crystal field changeand nonradiative relaxation.,Journal of Applied Physics,2015,1
Broadband conversion of ultraviolet to visible and near-infrared emission in Gd3+/Yb3+ codoped germanate glass,Lili Tao; Bo Zhou; Gongxun Bai; Yonggang Wang; Jianhua Hao; Yuen H Tsang,Abstract Gd 3+/Yb 3+ co-doped germanate glasses were fabricated using the melt-quenching method. Broadband visible emission was observed from the gadolinium dopedgermanate glasses under ultraviolet (UV) excitation; and white-light was obtained bymodifying Yb 3+ co-dopant concentration. Through this co-doped system; the white-lightemission can be further converted into the near-infrared range which is matched well withthe energy band gap of commercial silicon solar cell. The possible energy transferprocesses involved are proposed and discussed according to the excitation; emission andfluorescence decay measurements. The effect of Yb 3+ ion concentration with respect tofixed Gd 3+ ions on the visible and near-infrared (NIR) emission has also been studied.

In situ X-raydiffraction (XRD) is used to characterize the thermal expansion coefficient at lowtemperature. The abnormal behavior in lattice parameter at 80 K may be the hint of a phasetransition. High resolution XRD is performed to detect the two kinds of dislocations; ie screwand edge. Results show that the density of edge dislocation is a little larger than that of thescrew one. The total dislocation density has the order of about 108 cm-2. Edge dislocationdensity decreases with the increase of the film thickness.

A novel hydrate-based thin-film phosphor: low-temperature growth process and properties,JH Hao; J Gao,Abstract Thin films of barium chloride hydrate doped with cerium were deposited by spraypyrolysis of aqueous solutions. The cathodoluminescence (CL) spectrum consists of twopeaks at 443 and 485 nm due to 4f–5d transitions of the cerium ion in thin films without post-heat treatment. The CL depended dramatically on deposition temperature between 250° Cand 500° C. The phenomenon is directly related to the change of crystallinity and Clconcentration of the thin films. The CL spectra of thin films of BaCl 2· 2H 2 O: Ce werecompared on various substrates. The relaxation behavior of CL was also observed in thin-film phosphor. Our results indicate that the material studied as thin-film phosphor is uniquesince it contains water.

The markedly differentbehavior of the soft modes in thin films from that in the bulk is explained by the existence oflocal polar regions.,APS March Meeting Abstracts,2001,*

Hardening of the Soft-mode Phonons in SrTiO3 Thin Films Measured by Far-infrared Ellipsometry and Raman Scattering,Andrei Sirenko; Christian Bernhard; Andrzej Golnik; Ilia Akimov; Anna Clark; Jianhua Hao; Xiaoxing Xi,Abstract We report the experimental studies of the vibrational spectra and dielectricproperties of SrTiO 3 (STO) films with the thickness ranging from 0.5 to 2 mum grown bypulsed laser deposition. The Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) ellipsometry between 30 and700 cm-1 and electric field-induced Raman scattering techniques have been used forinvestigation of the phonon behavior. FT-IR ellipsometry measurements have been carriedout using synchrotron radiation at the U4IR and U12IR beamlines; the Brookhaven NationalLaboratory. Results of FT-IR ellipsometry and Raman spectra have been compared with thelow-frequency measurements of the static dielectric constant. The temperature dependenceof the soft mode frequency in the films reveals hardening of this phonon compared to that inbulk crystals. This observation is in a good agreement with the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller …,APS Meeting Abstracts,2000,*
Thin BST-Films on SrTiO_3: Nb-Substrates Studied By Specular and Diffuse X-Ray Reflectivity,Uwe Klemradt; Markus Aspelmeyer; Jianhua Hao; Xiaoxing Xi,Abstract The quality of the film-substrate interface is a limiting factor for many technologicalapplications of ferroelectric films; eg actuators or storage media. We will presentinvestigations of single-crystal Ba_0. 5Sr_0. 5TiO 3 (BST)-films deposited onto (0.5 wt.%) Nb-doped SrTiO_3-substrates with (100)-orientation. Films with thicknesses of 20 nm; 50 nmand 100 nm were investigated by grazing-incidence x-ray scattering at temperatures of 250K; 300 K and 350 K. The excellent sample quality allowed us to determine with highaccuracy the real structure of the samples; in particular the interfacial quality; film thicknessand density. Moreover; our experiments indicate strong interfacial roughness correlations inthe paraelectric phase; which are modified on approaching the ferroelectric phase.,APS Meeting Abstracts,2000,*

Interface Properties Between SrTiO 3 Thin Films and Electrodes,AM Clark; Jianhua Hao; Weidong Si; XX Xi,Abstract SrTiO 3 (STO) thin films were grown by pulsed laser deposition on single crystalSTO substrates with a SrRuO 3 buffer layer; which also serves as a bottom electrode.Measurements of the low frequency dielectric properties were performed in a parallel platecapacitor configuration for a range of temperatures using different top electrode materials.The contribution to the interfacial potential from Schottky barriers was investigated. Incomparison to STO single crystals; thin films have continued dielectric non-linearity aboveT∼ 70 K. This complicates conventional Schottky barrier height measurements using CVcurves because both Schottky barriers and dielectric non-linearity result in a decrease indielectric constant under applied electric fields. However; by using IV data; difficulties relatedto field dependence of the dielectric constant may be removed. Barrier height …,MRS Online Proceedings Library Archive,1999,*

Dielectric properties of pulsed laser deposited SrTiO 3 thin films,AM Clark; Jianhua Hao; Weidong Si; XX Xi,Abstract Low frequency dielectric loss and nonlinearity in pulsed laser deposited SrTiO 3thin films were studied. A low loss tangent in the order of 10− 4; close to the level found inSrTiO 3 single crystals; was observed. Combined with a large tunability; this resulted in afigure of merit for frequency and phase agile materials that can rival that observed in singlecrystals. The SrTiO 3 thin films with thickness ranging from 25 nm to 2.5 μ1 were grown onSrRuO 3 electrode layers. The loss depends strongly on the thickness; but differently aboveand below T∼ 80 K. Our result suggests that; in the high temperature regime; the interfacialdead layer effect dominates while; in the low temperature regime; the losses related to thestructural phase transition and quantum fluctuations are important.

Grazing incidence diffraction study of thin epitaxial Ba0. 5Sr0. 5TiO3 films on SrTiO3 substrate,M Aspelmeyer; U Klemradt; J Hao; XX Xi,The properties of thin ferroelectric films are largely determined by surface effects and theatomic and electronic structure of interfaces between the ferroelectric films and the substrate[1-3]. Since soft phonon modes are well known to play an important role in many proper andincipient ferroelectrics; finite size effects can be very pronounced in thin ferroelectric films;including even a suppression of the ferroelectric phase [4]. To obtain a better understandingof the relationship between precursor effects; the ferroelectric phase transition and the filmthickness; we investigated single-crystalline Ba0. 5Sr0. 5TiO3 (BST) thin films of variousthicknesses ranging from 10 nm to 150 nm. Owing to its proper ferroelectric transition; BSTcan be considered a model system for ferroelectric transitions of purely displacive character.In addition; the large dielectric constant of the paraelectric phase makes BST a very …,*,*,*
