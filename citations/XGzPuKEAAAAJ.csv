A foundation for capturing and querying complex multidimensional data,Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian S Jensen; Curtis E Dyreson,Abstract On-line analytical processing (OLAP) systems considerably improve data analysisand are finding wide-spread use. OLAP systems typically employ multidimensional datamodels to structure their data. This paper identifies 11 modeling requirements formultidimensional data models. These requirements are derived from an assessment ofcomplex data found in real-world applications. A survey of 14 multidimensional data modelsreveals shortcomings in meeting some of the requirements. Existing models do not supportmany-to-many relationships between facts and dimensions; lack built-in mechanisms forhandling change and time; lack support for imprecision; and are generally unable to insertdata with varying granularities. This paper defines an extended multidimensional datamodel and algebraic query language that address all 11 requirements. The model reuses …,Information Systems,2001,340
Multidimensional data modeling for complex data,TB Pedersen; CS Jensen,Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) systems considerably ease the process of analyzingbusiness data and have become widely used in industry. Such systems primarily employmultidimensional data models to structure their data. However current multidimensional datamodels fall short in their abilities to model the complex data found in some real worldapplication domains. The paper presents nine requirements to multidimensional datamodels; each of which is exemplified by a real world; clinical case study. A survey of theexisting models reveals that the requirements not currently met include support for many-to-many relationships between facts and dimensions; built-in support for handling chance andtime; and support for uncertainty as well as different levels of granularity in the data.

Multidimensional database technology,Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian S Jensen,Multidimensional database technology is a key factor in the interactive analysis of largeamounts of data for decision making purposes. In contrast to previous technologies; thesedatabases view data as multidimensional cubes that are particularly well suited for dataanalysis. Multidimensional models categorize data either as facts with associated numericalmeasures or as textual dimensions that characterize the facts. Queries aggregate measurevalues over a range of dimension values to provide results such as total sales per month of agiven product. Multidimensional database technology is being applied to distributed dataand to new types of data that current technology often cannot adequately analyze. Forexample; classic techniques such as preaggregation cannot ensure fast query responsetimes when data-such as that obtained from sensors or GPS-equipped moving objects …,Computer,2001,267
Nearest neighbor queries in road networks,Christian S Jensen; Jan Kolářvr; Torben Bach Pedersen; Igor Timko,Abstract With wireless communications and geo-positioning being widely available; itbecomes possible to offer new e-services that provide mobile users with information aboutother mobile objects. This paper concerns active; ordered k-nearest neighbor queries forquery and data objects that are moving in road networks. Such queries may be of use inmany services. Specifically; we present an easily implementable data model that serves wellas a foundation for such queries. We also present the design of a prototype system thatimplements the queries based on the data model. The algorithm used for the nearestneighbor search in the prototype is presented in detail. In addition; the paper reports onresults from experiments with the prototype system.,Proceedings of the 11th ACM international symposium on Advances in geographic information systems,2003,224
Multidimensional Data Modeling for Location-Based Services,CS Jensen; A Kligys; TB Pedersen; I Timko,Abstract With the recent and continuing advances in areas such as wireless communicationsand positioning technologies; mobile; location-based services are becoming possible. Suchservices deliver location-dependent content to their users. More specifically; these servicesmay capture the movements and requests of their users in multidimensional databases; ie;data warehouses; and content delivery may be based on the results of complex queries onthese data warehouses. Such queries aggregate detailed data in order to find usefulpatterns; eg; in the interaction of a particular user with the services. The application ofmultidimensional technology in this context poses a range of new challenges. The specificchallenge addressed here concerns the provision of an appropriate multidimensional datamodel. In particular; the paper extends an existing multidimensional data model and …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2004,196

Specifying OLAP cubes on XML data,Mikael R Jensen; Thomas H Møller; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) enables analysts to gain insight about datathrough fast and interactive access to a variety of possible views on information; organizedin a dimensional model. The demand for data integration is rapidly becoming larger as moreand more information sources appear in modern enterprises. In the data warehousingapproach; selected information is extracted in advance and stored in a repository; yieldinggood query performance. However; in many situations a logical (rather than physical)integration of data is preferable. Previous web-based data integration efforts have focusedalmost exclusively on the logical level of data models; creating a need for techniquesfocused on the conceptual level.

Location-Based Services–A Database Perspective,CS Jensen; A Friis-Christensen; TB Pedersen; D Pfoser; S Saltenis; N. Tryfona,Abstract. We are heading rapidly towards a global computing and information infrastructurethat will contain billions of wirelessly connected devices; many of which will offer so-calledlocation-based services to their mobile users always and everywhere. Indeed; users willsoon take ubiquitous wireless access to information and services for granted. This scenariois made possible by the rapid advances in the underlying hardware technologies; whichcontinue to follow variants of Moore's Law. Examples of location-based services includetracking; way-finding; traffic management; safety-related services; and mixed-reality games;to name but a few.

Extending practical pre-aggregation in on-line analytical processing,Torben Bach PedersenÝ; Christian S JensenÞ; Curtis E Dyreson,Abstract On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) based on a dimensional view of data isbeing used increasingly in traditional business applications as well as in applications suchas health care for the purpose of analyzing very large amounts of data. Pre-aggregation; theprior materialization of aggregate queries for later use; is an essential technique for ensuringadequate response time during data analysis. Full pre-aggregation; where all combinationsof aggregates are materialized; is infeasible. Instead; modern OLAP systems adopt thepractical pre-aggregation approach of materializing only select combinations of aggregatesand then re-use these for efficiently computing other aggregates. However; this re-use ofaggregates is contingent on the dimension hierarchies and the relationships between factsand dimensions satisfying stringent constraints. This severely limits the scope of the …,*,1999,112
Research issues in clinical data warehousing,Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian S Jensen,Medical informatics has been an important area for the application of computing anddatabase technology for at least four decades. This area may benefit from the functionalityoffered by data warehousing. However; the special nature of clinical applications posesdifferent and new requirements to data warehousing technologies; over those posed byconventional data warehouse applications. This article presents a number of exciting newresearch challenges posed by clinical applications; to be met by the database researchcommunity. These include the need for complex data modeling features; advanced temporalsupport; advanced classification structures; continuously valued data; dimensionallyreduced data; and the integration of very complex data. In addition; the support for clinicaltreatment protocols and medical research are interesting areas for research.,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 1998. Proceedings.

Using semantic web technologies for exploratory OLAP: a survey,Alberto Abelló; Oscar Romero; Torben Bach Pedersen; Rafael Berlanga; Victoria Nebot; Maria Jose Aramburu; Alkis Simitsis,This paper describes the convergence of some of the most influential technologies in the lastfew years; namely data warehousing (DW); on-line analytical processing (OLAP); and theSemantic Web (SW). OLAP is used by enterprises to derive important business-criticalknowledge from data inside the company. However; the most interesting OLAP queries canno longer be answered on internal data alone; external data must also be discovered (mostoften on the web); acquired; integrated; and (analytically) queried; resulting in a new type ofOLAP; exploratory OLAP. When using external data; an important issue is knowing theprecise semantics of the data. Here; SW technologies come to the rescue; as they allowsemantics (ranging from very simple to very complex) to be specified for web-availableresources. SW technologies do not only support capturing the “passive” semantics; but …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2015,92
Converting XML Data to UML diagrams for conceptual data integration,Mikael R Jensen; Thomas H Møller; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Extensible Markup Language (XML) is fast becoming the new standard for datarepresentation and exchange on the World Wide Web; eg; in B2B e-commerce. Modernenterprises need to combine data from many sources in order to answer important businessquestions; creating a need for integration of web-based XML data. Previous web-based dataintegration efforts have focused almost exclusively on the logical level of data models;creating a need for techniques that focus on the conceptual level in order to communicatethe structure and properties of the available data to users at a higher level of abstraction.The most widely used conceptual model at the moment is the Unified Modeling Language(UML).

Pre-aggregation in spatial data warehouses,Torben Bach Pedersen; Nektaria Tryfona,Abstract Data warehouses are becoming increasingly popular in the spatial domain; wherethey are used to analyze large amounts of spatial information for decision-making purposes.The data warehouse must provide very fast response times if popular analysis tools such asOn-Line Analytical Processing [2](OLAP) are to be applied successfully. In order for the dataanalysis to have an adequate performance; pre-aggregation; ie; pre-computation of partialquery answers; is used to speed up query processing. Normally; the data structures in thedata warehouse have to be very “well-behaved” in order for pre-aggregation to be feasible.However; this is not the case in many spatial applications. In this paper; we analyze theproperties of topological relationships between 2D spatial objects with respect to pre-aggregation and show why traditional pre-aggregation techniques do not work in this …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2001,87
Mining long; sharable patterns in trajectories of moving objects,Győző Gidófalvi; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract The efficient analysis of spatio-temporal data; generated by moving objects; is anessential requirement for intelligent location-based services. Spatio-temporal rules can befound by constructing spatio-temporal baskets; from which traditional association rule miningmethods can discover spatio-temporal rules. When the items in the baskets are spatio-temporal identifiers and are derived from trajectories of moving objects; the discovered rulesrepresent frequently travelled routes. For some applications; eg; an intelligent ridesharingapplication; these frequent routes are only interesting if they are long and sharable; ie; canpotentially be shared by several users. This paper presents a database projection basedmethod for efficiently extracting such long; sharable frequent routes. The method prunes thesearch space by making use of the minimum length and sharable requirements and …,Geoinformatica,2009,83
Multidimensional integrated ontologies: a framework for designing semantic data warehouses,Victoria Nebot; Rafael Berlanga; Juan Manuel Pérez; María José Aramburu; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract The Semantic Web enables organizations to attach semantic annotations takenfrom domain and application ontologies to the information they generate. The concepts inthese ontologies could describe the facts; dimensions and categories implied in the analysissubjects of a data warehouse. In this paper we propose the Semantic Data Warehouse to bea repository of ontologies and semantically annotated data resources. We also propose anontology-driven framework to design multidimensional analysis models for Semantic DataWarehouses. This framework provides means for building a Multidimensional IntegratedOntology (MIO) including the classes; relationships and instances that represent interestinganalysis dimensions; and it can be also used to check the properties required by currentmultidimensional databases (eg; dimension orthogonality; category satisfiability; etc.) In …,*,2009,82

Position list word aligned hybrid: optimizing space and performance for compressed bitmaps,François Deliège; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Compressed bitmap indexes are increasingly used for efficiently querying verylarge and complex databases. The Word Aligned Hybrid (WAH) bitmap compressionscheme is commonly recognized as the most efficient compression scheme in terms of CPUefficiency. However; WAH compressed bitmaps use a lot of storage space. This paperpresents the Position List Word Aligned Hybrid (PLWAH) compression scheme thatimproves significantly over WAH compression by better utilizing the available bits and newCPU instructions. For typical bit distributions; PLWAH compressed bitmaps are often half thesize of WAH bitmaps and; at the same time; offer an even better CPU efficiency. The resultsare verified by theoretical estimates and extensive experiments on large amounts of bothsynthetic and real-world data.,Proceedings of the 13th international conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,79
Discovering multidimensional structure in relational data,Mikael R Jensen; Thomas Holmgren; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) systems based on multidimensionaldatabases are essential elements of decision support. However; most existing data is storedin “ordinary” relational OLTP databases; ie; data has to be (re-) modeled asmultidimensional cubes before the advantages of OLAP tools are available. In this paper wepresent an approach for the automatic construction of multidimensional OLAP databaseschemas from existing relational OLTP databases; enabling easy OLAP design and analysisfor most existing data sources. This is achieved through a set of practical and effectivealgorithms for discovering multidimensional schemas from relational databases. Thealgorithms take a wide range of available metadata into account in the discovery process;including functional and inclusion dependencies; and key and cardinality information.,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2004,77

Clickstream analysis can reveal usage patterns on thecompany's web site and give a highly improved understanding of customer behavior. Thisunderstanding can then be utilized for improving customer satisfaction with the web site andthe company in general; yielding a huge business advantage. In this paper; we present theresults of a clickstream analysis project at a large Danish mortgage provider.

Supporting imprecision in multidimensional databases using granularities,Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian S Jensen; Curtis E Dyreson,Online analytical processing (OLAP) technologies are being used widely; but the lack ofeffective means of handling data imprecision; which occurs when exact values are notknown precisely or are entirely missing; represents a major obstacle in applying thesetechnologies in many domains. The paper develops techniques for handling imprecisionthat aim to maximally reuse existing OLAP modeling constructs such as dimensionhierarchies and granularities. With imprecise data available in the database; queries aretested to determine whether or not they may be answered precisely given the available data;if not; alternative queries unaffected by the imprecision are suggested. When processingqueries affected by imprecision; techniques are proposed that take into account theimprecision in the grouping of the data; in the subsequent aggregate computation; and in …,Scientific and Statistical Database Management; 1999.

RiTE: Providing on-demand data for right-time data warehousing,Christian Thomsen; Torben Bach Pedersen; Wolfgang Lehner,Data warehouses (DWs) have traditionally been loaded with data at regular time intervals;eg; monthly; weekly; or daily; using fast bulk loading techniques. Recently; the trend is toinsert all (or only some) new source data very quickly into DWs; called near-realtime DWs(right-time DWs). This is done using regular INSERT statements; resulting in too low insertspeeds. There is thus a great need for a solution that makes inserted data available quickly;while still providing bulk-load insert speeds. This paper presents RiTE (" Right-Time ETL"); amiddleware system that provides exactly that. A data producer (ETL) can insert data thatbecomes available to data consumers on demand. RiTE includes an innovative main-memory based catalyst that provides fast storage and offers concurrency control.

Physically integratingdata from new sources into OLAP systems is a long and time-consuming process; makinglogical integration the better choice in many situations. The increasing use of ExtendedMarkup Language (XML) suggests that the required external data will most often beavailable in XML format. We present a theoretically well-founded approach to the logicalfederation of OLAP and XML data sources. The approach allows external XML data to bepresented along with dimensional data in OLAP query results and enables the use ofexternal XML data for selection and grouping.

Privacy-preserving data mining on moving object trajectories,Gyozo Gidofalvi; Xuegang Huang; Torben Bach Pedersen,The popularity of embedded positioning technologies in mobile devices and thedevelopment of mobile communication technology have paved the way for powerful location-based services (LBSs). To make LBSs useful and user-friendly; heavy use is made ofcontext information; including patterns in user location data which are extracted by datamining methods. However; there is a potential conflict of interest: the data mining methodswant as precise data as possible; while the users want to protect their privacy by notdisclosing their exact movements. This paper aims to resolve this conflict by proposing ageneral framework that allows user location data to be anonymized; thus preserving privacy;while still allowing interesting patterns to be discovered.

Contextualizing data warehouses with documents,Juan Manuel Pérez-Martínez; Rafael Berlanga-Llavori; María José Aramburu-Cabo; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Current data warehouse and OLAP technologies are applied to analyze thestructured data that companies store in databases. The context that helps to understand dataover time is usually described separately in text-rich documents. This paper proposes tointegrate the traditional corporate data warehouse with a document warehouse; resulting ina contextualized warehouse. Thus; the user first selects an analysis context by supplyingsome keywords. Then; the analysis is performed on a novel type of OLAP cube; called an R-cube; which is materialized by retrieving and ranking the documents and corporate factsrelated to the selected context.,Decision Support Systems,2008,62

Highly scalable trip grouping for large-scale collective transportation systems,Gyozo Gidofalvi; Torben Bach Pedersen; Tore Risch; Erik Zeitler,Abstract Transportation-related problems; like road congestion; parking; and pollution; areincreasing in most cities. In order to reduce traffic; recent work has proposed methods forvehicle sharing; for example for sharing cabs by grouping" closeby" cab requests and thusminimizing transportation cost and utilizing cab space. However; the methods published sofar do not scale to large data volumes; which is necessary to facilitate large-scale collectivetransportation systems; eg; ride-sharing systems for large cities. This paper presents highlyscalable trip grouping algorithms; which generalize previous techniques and support inputrates that can be orders of magnitude larger. The following three contributions make thegrouping algorithms scalable.

Evaluating the markov assumption for web usage mining,Søren Jespersen; Torben Bach Pedersen; Jesper Thorhauge,Abstract Web usage mining concerns the discovery of common browsing patterns; ie; pagesrequested in sequence; from web logs. To cope with the enormous amounts of data; severalaggregated structures based on statistical models of web surfing have appeared; eg; theHypertext Probabilistic Gramma (HPG) model [2]. These techniques typically rely on theMarkov assumption with history depth n; ie; it is assumed that the next requested page isonly dependent on the last n pages visited. This is not always valid; ie false browsingpatterns may be discovered. However; to our knowledge there has been no systematic studyof the validity of the Markov assumption wrt. web usage mining and the resulting quality ofthe mined browsing patterns. In this paper we systematically investigate the quality ofbrowsing patterns mined from structures based on the Markov assumption.

A survey of open source tools for business intelligence,Christian Thomsen; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract The industrial use of open source Business Intelligence (BI) tools is not yetcommon. It is therefore of interest to explore which possibilities are available for open sourceBI and compare the tools. In this survey paper; we consider the capabilities of a number ofopen source tools for BI. In the paper; we consider three Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) tools;three On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) servers; two OLAP clients; and four databasemanagement systems (DBMSs). Further; we describe the licenses that the products arereleased under. It is argued that the ETL tools are still not very mature for use in industrywhile the DBMSs are mature and applicable to real-world projects. The OLAP servers andclients are not as powerful as commercial solutions but may be useful in less demandingprojects.,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2005,48
Specification-based data reduction in dimensional data warehouses,Janne Skyt; Christian S Jensen; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Many data warehouses contain massive amounts of data; accumulated over longperiods of time. In some cases; it is necessary or desirable to either delete “old” data or tomaintain the data at an aggregate level. This may be due to privacy concerns; in which casethe data are aggregated to levels that ensure anonymity. Another reason is the desire tomaintain a balance between the uses of data that change as the data age and the size of thedata; thus avoiding overly large data warehouses. This paper presents effective techniquesfor data reduction that enable the gradual aggregation of detailed data as the data ages.With these techniques; data may be aggregated to higher levels as they age; enabling themaintenance of more compact; consolidated data and the compliance with privacyrequirements.

A relevance-extended multi-dimensional model for a data warehouse contextualized with documents,Juan Manuel Pérez; Rafael Berlanga; María José Aramburu; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Current data warehouse and OLAP technologies can be applied to analyze thestructured data that companies store in their databases. The circumstances that describe thecontext associated with these data can be found in other internal and external sources ofdocuments. In this paper we propose to combine the traditional corporate data warehousewith a document warehouse; resulting in a contextualized warehouse. Thus; contextualizedwarehouses keep a historical record of the fact and their contexts as described by thedocuments. In this framework; the user selects an analysis context which is represented as anovel type of OLAP cube; here called R-cube. R-cubes are characterized by two specialdimensions; namely: the relevance and the context dimensions. The first dimensionmeasures the relevance of each fact in the selected analysis context; whereas the second …,Proceedings of the 8th ACM international workshop on Data warehousing and OLAP,2005,47

Existing techniques for analyzing click sequences have differentdrawbacks; ie; either huge storage requirements; excessive I/O cost; or scalability problemswhen additional information is introduced into the analysis. In this paper we present a newhybrid approach for analyzing click sequences that aims to overcome these drawbacks.

ETLMR: a highly scalable dimensional ETL framework based on mapreduce,Xiufeng Liu; Christian Thomsen; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) flows periodically populate data warehouses (DWs)with data from different source systems. An increasing challenge for ETL flows is to processhuge volumes of data quickly. MapReduce is establishing itself as the de-facto standard forlarge-scale data-intensive processing. However; MapReduce lacks support for high-levelETL specific constructs; resulting in low ETL programmer productivity. This paper presents ascalable dimensional ETL framework; ETLMR; based on MapReduce. ETLMR has built-innative support for operations on DW-specific constructs such as star schemas; snowflakeschemas and slowly changing dimensions (SCDs). This enables ETL developers toconstruct scalable MapReduce-based ETL flows with very few code lines.

Physically integrating unexpected data into suchsystems is a long and time-consuming process making logical integration; ie; federation; thebetter choice in many situations. The increasing use of Extended Markup Language (XML);eg in business-to-business (B2B) applications; suggests that the required data will often beavailable as XML data. This means that logical federations of OLAP and XML databases willbe very attractive in many cases. However; for such OLAP-XML federations to be useful;effective optimization techniques for such systems are needed. In this paper we presentnovel techniques for query optimization in federations of OLAP and XML databases. Thetechniques include so-called inlining of XML data in OLAP predicates; caching; and pre …,Proceedings of the 5th ACM international workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP,2002,43
Evaluating XML-Extended OLAP Queries Based on a Physical Algebra,Xuepeng Yin; Torben Bach Pedersen.,Abstract In today's OLAP systems; integrating fast changing data; eg; stock quotes;physically into a cube is complex and time consuming. The widespread use of XML makes itvery possible that this data is available in XML format on the WWW. Thus; making XML datalogically federated with OLAP systems is desirable. In this paper; we extend previous workon the logical federation of OLAP and XML data sources by presenting a simplified querysemantics; a physical query algebra and a robust OLAP-XML query engine. Performanceexperiments with a prototypical implementation suggest that the performance for OLAP-XMLfederations is comparable to queries on physically integrated data.,Journal of Database Management; Hershey,2006,42
Data management in the mirabel smart grid system,Matthias Boehm; Lars Dannecker; Andreas Doms; Erik Dovgan; Bogdan Filipič; Ulrike Fischer; Wolfgang Lehner; Torben Bach Pedersen; Yoann Pitarch; Laurynas Šikšnys; Tea Tušar,Abstract Nowadays; Renewable Energy Sources (RES) are attracting more and moreinterest. Thus; many countries aim to increase the share of green energy and have to facewith several challenges (eg; balancing; storage; pricing). In this paper; we address thebalancing challenge and present the MIRABEL project which aims to prototype an EnergyData Management System (EDMS) which takes benefit of flexibilities to efficiently balanceenergy demand and supply. The EDMS consists of millions of heterogeneous nodes thateach incorporates advanced components (eg; aggregation; forecasting; scheduling;negotiation). We describe each of these components and their interaction. Preliminaryexperimental results confirm the feasibility of our EDMS.,Proceedings of the 2012 Joint EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2012,39
A survey of open source tools for business intelligence,Christian Thomsen; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract The industrial use of open source Business Intelligence (BI) tools is becoming morecommon; but is still not as widespread as for other types of software. It is therefore of interestto explore which possibilities are available for open source BI and compare the tools. In thissurvey article; we consider the capabilities of a number of open source tools for BI. In thearticle; we consider a number of Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) tools; database managementsystems (DBMSs); On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) servers; and OLAP clients. We findthat; unlike the situation a few years ago; there now exist mature and powerful tools in allthese categories. However; the functionality still falls somewhat short of that found incommercial tools.,International Journal of Data Warehousing and Mining (IJDWM),2009,39
pygrametl: A powerful programming framework for extract-transform-load programmers,Christian Thomsen; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes are used for extracting data; transformingit and loading it into data warehouses (DWs). Many tools for creating ETL processes exist.The dominating tools all use graphical user interfaces (GUIs) where the developer visuallydefines the data flow and operations. In this paper; we challenge this approach and proposeto do ETL programming by writing code. To make the programming easy; we present the(Python-based) framework pygrametl which offers commonly used functionality for ETLdevelopment. By using the framework; the developer can efficiently create effective ETLsolutions from which the full power of programming can be exploited. Our experiments showthat when pygrametl is used; both the development time and running time are short whencompared to an existing GUI-based tool.,Proceedings of the ACM twelfth international workshop on Data warehousing and OLAP,2009,38
Integrating XML data in the TARGIT OLAP system,Dennis Pedersen; Jesper Pedersen; Torben Bach Pedersen,We present work on logical integration of OLAP and XML data sources; carried out incooperation between TARGIT; a Danish OLAP client vendor; and Aalborg University. Aprototype has been developed that allows XML data on the WWW to be used as dimensionsand measures in the OLAP system in the same way as ordinary dimensions and measures;providing a powerful and flexible way to handle unexpected or short-term data requirementsas well as rapidly changing data. Compared to earlier work; we present several majorextensions that resulted from TARGIT's requirements. These include the ability to use XMLdata as measures; as well as a novel multigranular data model and query language thatformalizes and extends the TARGIT data model and query language.,Data Engineering; 2004.

Estimating the capacity of the location-based advertising channel,Gyozo Gidofalvi; Hans Ravnkjaer Larsen; Torben Bach Pedersen,Delivering'relevant'advertisements to consumers carrying mobile devices is regarded bymany as one of the most promising mobile business opportunities. The relevance of amobile ad depends on at least two factors:(1) the proximity of the mobile consumer to theproduct or service being advertised; and (2) the match between the product or service andthe interest of the mobile consumer. The interest of the mobile consumer can be eitherexplicit (expressed by the mobile consumer) or implicit (inferred from user characteristics).This paper tries to empirically estimate the capacity of the Mobile Advertising channel; ie thenumber of relevant ads that can be delivered to mobile consumers. The estimations arebased on a simulated mobile consumer population and simulated mobile ads. Both of thesimulated data sets are realistic and derived based on real-world data sources about …,International Journal of Mobile Communications,2008,35

Data modeling for mobile services in the real world,Christian S Jensen; Torben Bach Pedersen; Laurynas Speičys; Igor Timko,Abstract Research contributions on data modeling; data structures; query processing; andindexing for mobile services may have an impact in the longer term; but each contributiontypically offers an isolated solution to one small part of the practical problem of deliveringmobile services in the real world. In contrast; this paper describes holistic concepts andtechniques for mobile data modeling that are readily applicable in practice. Focus is onservices to be delivered to mobile users; such as route guidance; point-of-interest search;road pricing; parking payment; traffic monitoring; etc. While geo-referencing of content isimportant; it is even more important to relate content to the transportation infrastructure. Inaddition; several sophisticated; integrated representations of the infrastructure are needed.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2003,33
Aggregating and disaggregating flexibility objects,Laurynas Šikšnys; Emmanouil Valsomatzis; Katja Hose; Torben Bach Pedersen,In many scientific and commercial domains; we encounter flexibility objects; ie; objects withexplicit flexibilities in a time and an amount dimension (eg; energy or product amount).Applications of flexibility objects require novel and efficient techniques capable of handlinglarge amounts of such objects while preserving flexibility. Hence; this paper formally definesthe concept of flexibility objects (flex-objects) and provides a novel and efficient solution foraggregating and disaggregating flex-objects. Out of the broad range of possibleapplications; this paper will focus on smart grid energy data management and discussstrategies for aggregation and disaggregation of flex-objects while retaining flexibility. Thispaperfurther extends these approaches beyond flex-objects originating from energyconsumption by additionally considering flex-objects originating from energy production …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,30
A probabilistic data model and algebra for location-based data warehouses and their implementation,Igor Timko; Curtis Dyreson; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract This paper proposes a novel; probabilistic data model and algebra that improvesthe modeling and querying of uncertain data in spatial OLAP (SOLAP) to support location-based services. Data warehouses that support location-based services need to combinecomplex hierarchies; such as road networks or transportation infrastructures; with static anddynamic content; eg; speed limits and vehicle positions; respectively. Both the hierarchiesand the content are often uncertain in real-world applications. Our model supports the use ofprobability distributions within both facts and dimensions. We give an algebra that correctlyaggregates uncertain data over uncertain hierarchies. This paper also describes animplementation of the model and algebra; gives a complexity analysis of the algebra; andreports on an empirical; experimental evaluation of the implementation.

Mapreduce-based dimensional etl made easy,Xiufeng Liu; Christian Thomsen; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract This paper demonstrates ETLMR; a novel dimensional Extract--Transform--Load(ETL) programming framework that uses Map-Reduce to achieve scalability. ETLMR hasbuilt-in native support of data warehouse (DW) specific constructs such as star schemas;snowflake schemas; and slowly changing dimensions (SCDs). This makes it possible tobuild MapReduce-based dimensional ETL flows very easily. The ETL process can beconfigured with only few lines of code. We will demonstrate the concrete steps in usingETLMR to load data into a (partly snowflaked) DW schema. This includes configuration ofdata sources and targets; dimension processing schemes; fact processing; and deployment.In addition; we also present the scalability on large data sets.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,28
Flexible exchange of farming device data,Nadeem Iftikhar; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract A new trend in the farming business is to replace conventional farming devices withcomputerized farming devices. Accordingly; numerous computer-based farming devices forlogging; processing and exchanging data have recently been installed on moving farmmachinery such as tractors. The exchange of data generally takes place between thedevices and farming systems; mostly installed at the premises of farmers; contractors;advisory services; etc. In most cases; data exchange is based on farming data exchangestandards and is bi-directional. Bi-directional data exchange allows different devices andsystems to exchange data based on a predefined set of rules. In consequence; many hand-coded data exchange solutions have been developed in the farming business. Althoughefforts regarding incorporating data exchange standards have been made; their actual …,Computers and Electronics in Agriculture,2011,28
R-cubes: OLAP cubes contextualized with documents,Juan Manuel Pérez; Rafael Berlanga; Maria Jose Aramburu; Torben Bach Pedersen,Current data warehouse and OLAP (Kimball and Ross; 2002) technologies can be efficientlyapplied to analyze the huge amounts of structured data that companies produce. Theseorganizations also produce many text documents and use the Web as their largest source ofexternal information. Although these documents include highly valuable information thatshould also be exploited by companies; they cannot be analyzed by current OLAPtechnologies because they are unstructured and mainly contain text. The current trend is tofind these documents available in XML-like formats. Our proposal is to build XML documentwarehouses that can be used by companies to store unstructured information coming fromtheir internal and external sources. In (Perez et al.; 2005) we proposed an architecture forthe integration of a corporate warehouse of structured data with a warehouse of text-rich …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007.

Object-extended OLAP querying,Torben Bach Pedersen; Junmin Gu; Arie Shoshani; Christian S Jensen,Abstract On-line analytical processing (OLAP) systems based on a dimensional view of datahave found widespread use in business applications and are being used increasingly in non-standard applications. These systems provide good performance and ease-of-use.However; the complex structures and relationships inherent in data in non-standardapplications are not accommodated well by OLAP systems. In contrast; object databasesystems are built to handle such complexity; but do not support OLAP-type querying well.This paper presents the concepts and techniques underlying a flexible;“multi-model”federated system that enables OLAP users to exploit simultaneously the features of OLAPand object systems. The system allows data to be handled using the most appropriate datamodel and technology: OLAP systems for dimensional data and object database systems …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2009,27
Using a time granularity table for gradual granular data aggregation,Nadeem Iftikhar; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract The majority of today's systems increasingly require sophisticated datamanagement as they need to store and to query large amounts of data for analysis andreporting purposes. In order to keep more “detailed” data available for longer periods;“old”data has to be reduced gradually to save space and improve query performance; especiallyon resource-constrained systems with limited storage and query processing capabilities. Anumber of data reduction solutions have been developed; however an effective solutionparticularly based on gradual data reduction is missing. This paper presents an effectivesolution for data reduction based on gradual granular data aggregation. With the gradualgranular data aggregation mechanism; older data can be made coarse-grained whilekeeping the newest data fine-grained. For instance; when data is 3 months old aggregate …,Fundamenta Informaticae,2014,25
CloudETL: scalable dimensional ETL for hive,Xiufeng Liu; Christian Thomsen; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) programs process data into data warehouses (DWs).Rapidly growing data volumes demand systems that scale out. Recently; much attention hasbeen given to MapReduce for parallel handling of massive data sets in cloud environments.Hive is the most widely used RDBMS-like system for DWs on MapReduce and providesscalable analytics. It is; however; challenging to do proper dimensional ETL processing withHive; eg; the concept of slowly changing dimensions (SCDs) is not supported (and due tolacking support for UPDATEs; SCDs are complex to handle manually). Also the powerful Pigplatform for data processing on MapReduce does not support such dimensional ETLprocessing. To remedy this; we present the ETL framework CloudETL which uses Hadoop toparallelize ETL execution and to process data into Hive.

Efficient distance-aware query evaluation on indoor moving objects,Xike Xie; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen,Indoor spaces accommodate large parts of people's life. The increasing availability of indoorpositioning; driven by technologies like Wi-Fi; RFID; and Bluetooth; enables a variety ofindoor location-based services (LBSs). Efficient indoor distance-aware queries on indoormoving objects play an important role in supporting and boosting such LBSs. However; thedistance-aware query evaluation on indoor moving objects is challenging because:(1)indoor spaces are characterized by many special entities and thus render distancecalculation very complex;(2) the limitations of indoor positioning technologies createinherent uncertainties in indoor moving objects data. In this paper; we propose a completeset of techniques for efficient distance-aware queries on indoor moving objects. We defineand categorize the indoor distances in relation to indoor uncertain objects; and derive …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,23
Cab-sharing: An effective; door-to-door; on-demand transportation service,Gyözö Gidofalvi; Torben Bach Pedersen,ABSTRACT City transportation is an increasing problem. Public transportation iscosteffective; but do not provide doortodoor transportation; This makes the far moreexpensive cabs attractive and scarce. This paper proposes a location-based Cab-SharingService (CSS); which reduces cab fare costs and effectively utilizes available cabs. The CSSaccepts cab requests from mobile devices in the form of origin-destination pairs. Then itautomatically groups closeby requests to minimize the cost; utilize cab space; and servicecab requests in a timely manner. Simulationbased experiments show that the CSS cangroup cab requests in a way that effectively utilizes resources and achieves significantsavings; making cab-sharing a new; promising mode of transportation.,The 6th European Congress on Intelligent Transport Systems and Services; 18-20 Jun; 2007; Aalborg; Denmark,2007,23
ST--ACTS: a spatio-temporal activity simulator,Gyozo Gidofalvi; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Creating complex spatio-temporal simulation models is a hot issue in the area ofspatio-temporal databases [7]. While existing Moving Object Simulators (MOSs) addressdifferent physical aspects of mobility; they neglect the important social and geo-demographical aspects of it. This paper presents ST-ACTS; a Spatio-Temporal ACTivitySimulator that; using various geo-statistical data sources and intuitive principles; models theso far neglected aspects. ST-ACTS considers that (1) objects (representing mobile users)move from one spatio-temporal location to another with the objective of performing a certainactivity at the latter location;(2) not all users are equally likely to perform a given activity;(3)certain activities are performed at certain locations and times; and (4) activities exhibitregularities that can be specific to a single user or to groups of users.

Building a web warehouse for accessibility data,Christian Thomsen; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract As more and more information is available on the web; it is a problem that manyweb resources are not accessible; ie; are not usable for users with special needs. Forexample; for a web page to be accessible; it should give text alternatives (ie; explanatorytexts) for images such that blind users that have the web pages read aloud automaticallyalso can obtain information about the images. In the European Internet AccessibilityObservatory (EIAO) project; a crawler that will evaluate the accessibility of thousands ofEuropean web sites is built. The crawler frequently performs many tests of the web sites andthus very large amounts of accessibility data are generated. Based on open-sourcesoftware; a data warehouse (DW) called EIAO DW is built to make analysis of the complexaccessibility data easy; reliable and fast. The EIAO DW is; thus; a data warehouse which …,Proceedings of the 9th ACM international workshop on Data warehousing and OLAP,2006,21
Achieving adaptivity for OLAP-XML federations,Dennis Pedersen; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Motivated by the need for more flexible OLAP systems; this paper presents work onlogical integration of external data in OLAP databases; carried out in cooperation betweenthe Danish OLAP client vendor targit and Aalborg University. Flexibility is ensured bysupporting XML as the external data format; since almost all data sources can be efficientlywrapped in XML. Earlier work has resulted in an extension of the targit system; allowingexternal XML data to be used as dimensions and measures in OLAP databases. This workhas led to a number of new idea for improving the system's ability to adapt to changes in itssurroundings. This paper describes the potential problems that may interrupt the operationof the integration system; in particular those caused by the often autonomous and unreliablenature of external XML data sources; and methods for handling these problems …,Proceedings of the 6th ACM international workshop on Data warehousing and OLAP,2003,20
Incomplete information in multidimensional databases,Curtis E Dyreson; Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian S Jensen,ABSTRACT While incomplete information is endemic to real-world data; currentmultidimensional data models are not engineered to manage incomplete information inbase data; derived data; and dimensions. This chapter presents several strategies formanaging incomplete information in multidimensional databases. Which strategy to use isdependent on the kind of incomplete information present; and also on where it occurs in themultidimensional database. A relatively simple strategy is to replace incomplete informationwith appropriate; complete information. The advantage of this strategy is that allmultidimensional databases can manage complete information. Other strategies requiremore substantial changes to the multidimensional database. One strategy is to reflect theincompleteness in computed aggregates; which is possible only if the multidimensional …,Multidimensional databases: problems and solutions,2003,20
Towards exploratory OLAP over linked open data–a case study,Dilshod Ibragimov; Katja Hose; Torben Bach Pedersen; Esteban Zimányi,Abstract Business Intelligence (BI) tools provide fundamental support for analyzing largevolumes of information. Data Warehouses (DW) and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)tools are used to store and analyze data. Nowadays more and more information is availableon the Web in the form of Resource Description Framework (RDF); and BI tools have a hugepotential of achieving better results by integrating real-time data from web sources into theanalysis process. In this paper; we describe a framework for so-called exploratory OLAPover RDF sources. We propose a system that uses a multidimensional schema of the OLAPcube expressed in RDF vocabularies. Based on this information the system is able to querydata sources; extract and aggregate data; and build a cube.

Instant social ride-sharing,Gyözö Gidófalvi; Gergely Herenyi; Torben Bach Pedersen,ABSTRACT Ride–sharing is a resource efficient mode of personal transportation. While theperceived benefits of ride–sharing include reduced travel times; transportation costs;congestion; and carbon emissions; its wide–spread adoption is hindered by a number ofbarriers. These include the scheduling and coordination of routes; safety risks; socialdiscomfort in sharing private spaces; and an imbalance of costs and benefits among parties.To this extent; this paper describes implementation details of a system for ride–sharing thateliminates these barriers; in particular the one relating to social aspects; by utilizing theconcepts of social networks and social interest groups. Realistic; city–wide simulations showthat the proposed social ride–sharing system is viable and effective.,The Fifteenth World Congress on Intelligent Transport Systems; Nov 16-20; 2008; New York; NY; USA,2008,19
MIRABEL DW: managing complex energy data in a smart grid,Laurynas Siksnys; Christian Thomsen; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract In the MIRABEL project; a data management system for a smart grid is developed toenable smarter scheduling of energy consumption such that; eg; charging of car batteries isdone during night when there is an overcapacity of green energy from windmills etc. Energycan then be requested by means of flex-offers which define flexibility with respect to time;amount; and/or price. In this paper; we describe MIRABEL DW; a data warehouse (DW) forthe management of the large amounts of complex energy data in MIRABEL. We present aunified schema that can manage data both at the level of the entire electricity network and atthe level of individual nodes; such as a single consumer node. The schema has a number ofcomplexities compared to typical DW schemas. These include facts about facts andcomposed non-atomic facts and unified handling of different kinds of flex-offers and time …,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2012,18

Multidimensional Databases.,Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Multidimensional databases is a key technology in the enabling of interactiveanalyses of large amounts of data for decision-making purposes. Multidimensionaldatabases differ from previous technologies by viewing data specifically as multidimensionalcubes; which have proven to be particularly well suited for data analyses. Multidimensionalmodels more specifically categorize data as either facts—which are the entities of interestwrt the analyses at hand; eg; a purchase in a retail business—or dimensions; which aremostly textual and characterize the facts; eg; the location of the purchase; the product beingpurchased; and the time of the purchase.

Arrowhead compliant virtual market of energy,Luis Lino Ferreira; Laurynas Siksnys; Per Pedersen; Petr Stluka; Christos Chrysoulas; Thibaut Le Guilly; Michele Albano; Ame Skou; César Teixeira; Torben Pedersen,Industrial processes use energy to transform raw materials and intermediate goods into finalproducts. Many efforts have been done on the minimization of energy costs in industrialplants. Apart from working on “how” an industrial process is implemented; it is possible toreduce the energy costs by focusing on “when” it is performed. Although; somemanufacturing plants (eg refining or petrochemical plants) can be inflexible with respect totime due to interdependencies in processes that must be respected for performance andsafety reasons; there are other industrial segments; such as alumina plants or discretemanufacturing; with more degrees of flexibility. These manufacturing plants can consider amore flexible scheduling of the most energy-intensive processes in response to dynamicprices and overall condition of the electricity market.

Spatiotemporal data cleansing for indoor RFID tracking data,Asif Iqbal Baba; Hua Lu; Xike Xie; Torben Bach Pedersen,The Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is increasingly being deployed in indoor trackingsystems; eg; airport baggage monitoring. However; the “dirtiness” in raw RFID readingshinder the progress of applying meaningful high level applications that range frommonitoring to analysis. Hence; it is indispensable to cleansing RFID data in such systems. Inthis paper; we focus on two quality aspects in raw indoor RFID data: temporal redundancyand spatial ambiguity. The former refers to the large number of repeated readings for thesame object and the same RFID reader during a period of time. The latter refers to theundetermined whereabouts of an object due to multiple readings by different readerssimultaneously. We investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of indoor spaces as wellas RFID reader deployment; and exploit them in designing effective data cleansing …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on,2013,16
Frequent route based continuous moving object location-and density prediction on road networks,Győző Gidófalvi; Christian Borgelt; Manohar Kaul; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Emerging trends in urban mobility have accelerated the need for effective trafficprediction and management systems. The present paper proposes a novel approach tousing continuously streaming moving object trajectories for traffic prediction andmanagement. The approach continuously performs three functions for streams of movingobject positions in road networks: 1) management of current evolving trajectories; 2)incremental mining of closed frequent routes; and 3) prediction of near-future locations anddensities based on 1) and 2). The approach is empirically evaluated on a large real-worlddata set of moving object trajectories; originating from a fleet of taxis; illustrating that detailedclosed frequent routes can be efficiently discovered and used for prediction.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2011,16
Pre-aggregation with probability distributions,Igor Timko; Curtis E Dyreson; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Motivated by the increasing need to analyze complex; uncertain multidimensionaldata this paper proposes probabilistic OLAP queries that are computed using probabilitydistributions rather than atomic values. The paper describes how to create probabilitydistributions from base data; and how the distributions can be subsequently used in pre-aggregation. Since the probability distributions can become large; we show how to achievegood time and space efficiency by approximating the distributions. We present the results ofseveral experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. The work ismotivatedwith a real-world case study; based on our collaboration with a leading Danishvendor of location-based services. This paper is the first to consider the approximateprocessing of probabilistic OLAP queries over probability distributions.,Proceedings of the 9th ACM international workshop on Data warehousing and OLAP,2006,16
How is BI used in industry?: Report from a knowledge exchange network,Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract After being born in industry; the topic of business intelligence (BI); has become anactive research topic; spanning research areas such as data warehousing; On-LineAnalytical Processing (OLAP); data mining; and data streams. Ideally; BI research should bedriven by industry needs. However; only little information on how BI is used in industry iscurrently available to the BI research community. This industrial paper presents theexperiences that the author has obtained from running a number of knowledge exchangeactivities related to BI; eg; network meetings and workshops; with partners in industry. Thepaper presents the network participants; the topics of the knowledge exchange activities;and the lessons learned over the last couple of years. For example; lessons relate to thepopularity of OLAP and data mining tools; the time spent on different tasks in BI projects …,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2004,16
Cost modeling and estimation for OLAP-XML federations,Dennis Pedersen; Karsten Riis; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract The ever-changing data requirements of today's dynamic businesses are nothandled well by current OLAP systems. Physical integration of data into OLAP systems is atime-consuming process; making logical federations the better choice in many cases. Theincreasing use of XML suggests that the required data will often be available in XML format.Thus; federations of OLAP and XML databases will be very attractive in many situations. Inan efficient implementation of OLAP-XML federations; cost-based optimization is a must;creating a need for an effective cost model for OLAP-XML federations.

The TreeScape System: reuse of pre-computed aggregates over irregular OLAP hierarchies,Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian S Jensen; Curtis E Dyreson,Abstract We present the TreeScape system that; unlike any other system known to theauthors; enables the reuse of pre-computed aggregate query results for irregular dimensionhierarchies; which occur frequently in practice. The system establishes a foundation forobtaining high query processing performance while pre-computing only limited aggregates.The paper shows how this reuse of aggregates is enabled through dimensiontransformations that occur transparently to the user.,VLDB,2000,16

Towards next generation BI systems: The analytical metadata challenge,Jovan Varga; Oscar Romero; Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian Thomsen,Abstract Next generation Business Intelligence (BI) systems require integration ofheterogeneous data sources and a strong user-centric orientation. Both needs entailmachine-processable metadata to enable automation and allow end users to gain access torelevant data for their decision making processes. Although evidently needed; there is noclear picture about the necessary metadata artifacts; especially considering user supportrequirements. Therefore; we propose a comprehensive metadata framework to support theuser assistance activities and their automation in the context of next generation BI systems.This framework is based on the findings of a survey of current user-centric approachesmainly focusing on query recommendation assistance. Finally; we discuss the benefits of theframework and present the plans for future work.,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2014,15
On-demand multidimensional data integration: toward a semantic foundation for cloud intelligence,Torben Bach Pedersen; Dennis Pedersen; Karsten Riis,Abstract Cloud intelligence is a collection of technologies emerging from the migration ofbusiness intelligence and analytics technologies to a cloud computing environmentcombined with exploiting the massive range of new intelligence opportunities opened up bycloud computing. Cloud computing introduces several trends which require traditionalbusiness intelligence techniques to be re-thought; including agility; the ability to assembleresources; eg; data sources; on-demand; and virtualization; eg; that data are provided as aservice over the web rather than stored in local databases. This paper focuses on thecombination of data source agility and data-as-a-service virtualization and its use for cloudintelligence. After presenting the novel vision of the Cloud Warehouse; the paper goes on topresent a comprehensive semantic foundation for on-demand multidimensional data …,The Journal of Supercomputing,2013,15
Distance-aware join for indoor moving objects,Xike Xie; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen,Indoor spaces accommodate large parts of people's lives. Relevant techniques are thusneeded to efficiently manage indoor moving objects; whose positions are detected bytechnologies; such as Assisted GPS; Wi-Fi; RFID; and Bluetooth. Among such techniques;the distance-aware join processing is of importance in practice for indoor spatial databases.Such join operators leverage a series of applications; such as indoor mobile service andfacility monitoring. However; distance-aware joining over indoor moving objects ischallenging because:(1) indoor spaces are characterized by many special entities and thusrender distance calculation very complex;(2) the limitations of indoor positioningtechnologies create inherent uncertainties in indoor moving objects data. In this paper; westudy two representative join predicates in indoor settings; semi-range join and semi …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,14
A data warehouse solution for analyzing rfid-based baggage tracking data,Tanvir Ahmed; Torben Bach Pedersen; Hua Lu,Today; airport baggage handling is far from perfect. Baggage goes on the wrong flights; isleft behind; or gets lost; which costs a lot of money for the airlines; as well as frustration forthe passengers. To remedy the situation; we present a data warehouse (DW) solution forstoring and analyzing spatio-temporal Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) baggagetracking data. Analysis of this data can yield interesting results on baggage flow; the causesof baggage mishandling; and the parties responsible for the mishandling (airline; airport;handler;...); which can ultimately lead to improved baggage handling quality. The paperpresents a carefully designed data warehouse (DW); with a relational schema sittingunderneath a multidimensional data cube; that can handle the many complexities in thedata.

Real-time business intelligence in the MIRABEL smart grid system,Ulrike Fischer; Dalia Kaulakienė; Mohamed E Khalefa; Wolfgang Lehner; Torben Bach Pedersen; Laurynas Šikšnys; Christian Thomsen,Abstract The so-called smart grid is emerging in the energy domain as a solution to providea stable; efficient and sustainable energy supply accommodating ever growing amounts ofrenewable energy like wind and solar in the energy production. Smart grid systems arehighly distributed; manage large amounts of energy related data; and must be able to reactrapidly (but intelligently) when conditions change; leading to substantial real-time businessintelligence challenges. This paper discusses these challenges and presents datamanagement solutions in the European smart grid project MIRABEL. These solutionsinclude real-time time series forecasting; real-time aggregation of the flexibilities in energysupply and demand; managing subscriptions for forecasted and flexibility data; efficientstorage of time series and flexibilities; and real-time analytical query processing spanning …,International Workshop on Business Intelligence for the Real-Time Enterprise,2012,14
Easy and effective parallel programmable ETL,Christian Thomsen; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) programs are used to load data into datawarehouses (DWs). An ETL program must extract data from sources; apply differenttransformations to it; and use the DW to look up/insert the data. It is both time consuming todevelop and to run an ETL program. It is; however; typically the case that the ETL programcan exploit both task parallelism and data parallelism to run faster. This; on the other hand;makes the development time longer as it is complex to create a parallel ETL program. Toremedy this situation; we propose efficient ways to parallelize typical ETL tasks and weimplement these new constructs in an ETL framework. The constructs are easy to apply anddo only require few modifications to an ETL program to parallelize it. They support both taskand data parallelism and give the programmer different possibilities to choose from. An …,Proceedings of the ACM 14th international workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP,2011,14
Schema design alternatives for multi-granular data warehousing,Nadeem Iftikhar; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Data warehousing is widely used in industry for reporting and analysis of hugevolumes of data at different levels of detail. In general; data warehouses use standarddimensional schema designs to organize their data. However; current data warehousingschema designs fall short in their ability to model the multi-granular data found in variousreal-world application domains. For example; modern farm equipment in a field producesmassive amounts of data at different levels of granularity that has to be stored and queried. Astudy of the commonly used data warehousing schemas exposes the limitation that theschema designs are intended to simply store data at the same single level of granularity.This paper on the other hand; presents several extended dimensional data warehousingschema design alternatives to store both detail and aggregated data at different levels of …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2010,14
Research challenges for cloud intelligence: invited talk,Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Cloud intelligence is a collection of technologies emerging from the migration ofbusiness intelligence and analytics technologies to a cloud computing environmentcombined with exploiting the massive range of new intelligence opportunities opened up bycloud computing. With cloud computing; we have to handle a paradigm shift in thecomputing infrastructure. Here; existing concepts such as storage; processes; computation;etc.; are virtualized to all be parts of the cloud. Thus; technologies have to become deviceand location independent; eg; different parts of the data will all reside in the cloud; but canbe dispersed; and even migrating; between many physical locations and devices. We thushave to start thinking about data management as a service; which in turn entails thatanalytics and intelligence also become services. Another aspect of cloud intelligence is …,Proceedings of the 2010 EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2010,14

RelaXML: bidirectional transfer between relational and XML data,Steffen Ulsø Knudsen; Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian Thomsen; Kristian Torp,In modern enterprises; almost all data is stored in relational databases. Additionally; mostenterprises increasingly collaborate with other enterprises in long-running read-writeworkflows; primarily through XML-based data exchange technologies such as Web services.However; bidirectional XML data exchange is cumbersome and must often be hand-coded;at considerable expense. This paper remedies the situation by proposing RELAXML; anautomatic and effective approach to bidirectional XML-based exchange of relational data.RELAXML supports re-use through multiple inheritance; and handles both export ofrelational data to XML documents and (re-) import of XML documents with a large degree offlexibility in terms of the SQL statements and XML document structures supported. Importand export are formally defined so as to avoid semantic problems; and algorithms to …,Database Engineering and Application Symposium; 2005. IDEAS 2005. 9th International,2005,14

In the system we plan todevelop; a multidimensional implementation of a relevance modeling document model willbe used for interactively querying the warehouse by allowing navigation in the structure ofdocuments and in a concept hierarchy of query terms. The facts described in the relevantdocuments will be ranked and analyzed in a novel OLAP cube model able to represent andmanage facts with relevance indexes.,European Conference on Information Retrieval,2005,14
Planning unobstructed paths in traffic-aware spatial networks,Shuo Shang; Jiajun Liu; Kai Zheng; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen; Ji-Rong Wen,Abstract Route planning and recommendation have received significant attention in recentyears. In this light; we study a novel problem of planning unobstructed paths in traffic-awarespatial networks (TAUP queries) to avoid potential traffic congestions. We propose twoprobabilistic TAUP queries:(1) a time-threshold query like “what is the path from the check-indesk to the flight SK 1217 with the minimum congestion probability to take at most 45minutes?”; and (2) a probability-threshold query like “what is the fastest path from the check-in desk to the flight SK 1217 whose congestion probability is less than 20%?”. These queriesare mainly motivated by indoor space applications; but are also applicable in outdoorspaces. We believe that these queries are useful in some popular applications; such asplanning unobstructed paths for VIP bags in airports and planning convenient routes for …,GeoInformatica,2015,13
Energy savings in mobile broadband network based on load predictions: Opportunities and potentials,Saulius Samulevicius; Torben Bach Pedersen; Troels Bundgaard Sorensen; Gilbert Micallef,The deployment of new network equipment is resulting in increasing energy consumption inmobile broadband networks (MBNs). This contributes to higher CO 2 emissions. Over thelast 10 years MBNs have grown considerably; and are still growing to meet the evolution intraffic volume carried in wireless networks. To save energy in MBNs; one of the options is toturn off parts of the network equipment in areas where traffic falls below a specific predefinedthreshold. This paper looks at a methodology for identifying periods of the day when cells orsites carrying low traffic are candidates for being totally or partly switched off; given that thedecrease in service quality can be controlled gracefully when the sites are switched off.Based on traffic data from an operational network; potential average energy savings ofapproximately 30% with some few low traffic cells/sites reaching up to 99% energy …,Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring); 2012 IEEE 75th,2012,13
Semantic web technologies for business intelligence,Rafael Berlanga; Oscar Romero; Alkis Simitsis; Victoria Nebot; Torben Bach Pedersen; Alberto Abelló; María José Aramburu,Abstract This chapter describes the convergence of two of the most influential technologiesin the last decade; namely business intelligence (BI) and the Semantic Web (SW). Businessintelligence is used by almost any enterprise to derive important business-critical knowledgefrom both internal and (increasingly) external data. When using external data; most oftenfound on the Web; the most important issue is knowing the precise semantics of the data.Without this; the results cannot be trusted. Here; Semantic Web technologies come to therescue; as they allow semantics ranging from very simple to very complex to be specified forany web-available resource. SW technologies do not only support capturing the “passive”semantics; but also support active inference and reasoning on the data. The chapter firstpresents a motivating running example; followed by an introduction to the relevant SW …,*,2012,13
Towards a data warehouse contextualized with web opinions,Juan Manuel Pérez; Rafael Berlanga; Maria José Aramburu; Torben Bach Pedersen,In this work we consider the web forums where the users give their opinion about theproducts or services that some organizations offer. The OLAP tools of the traditional datawarehouse systems; mainly designed to analyse structured data; cannot be directly appliedto take advantage of these on-line text documents. This paper describes the objectives ofour new project on so-called contextualized warehouses to exploit these opiniondocuments. In the analysis cubes of a contextualized warehouse; each fact is linked to adocument list. These documents provide information related to the fact (ie; they describe itscontext). The opinions in the web posts are typically expressed as small text fragments thatsometimes include incomplete sentences. In this paper; we propose to extend thecontextualized warehouse infrastructure with new opinion retrieval techniques conceived …,e-Business Engineering; 2008. ICEBE'08.

A data and query model for dynamic playlist generation,Claus Aage Jensen; Ester M Mungure; Torben Bach Pedersen; Kenneth Sorensen,Motivated by the increasing amount of digital music on the WWW; this paper presents a dataand query model for dynamic playlist generation. Queries are continuous; ie; songs areretrieved one at a time; allowing the user to dynamically influence the retrieval. The modelcan support arbitrary similarity measures; requiring only the identity properly of the metricspace to be obeyed. Using the similarity measure; we are able to retrieve songs similar to agiven seed song and avoid retrieval of songs similar to disliked songs. Additionally; themodel allows combined querying on both music metadata and musical content. Vie modelhas been implemented in a prototype system that is able to support a very large number ofboth songs and simultaneous users.,Data Engineering Workshop; 2007 IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,13
What can hierarchies do for data streams,Xuepeng Yin; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Much effort has been put into building data streams management systems forquerying data streams. However; the query languages have mostly been SQL-based andaimed for low-level analysis of base data; therefore; there has been little work on supportingOLAP-like queries that provide real-time multi-dimensional and summarized views of streamdata. In this paper; we introduce a multi-dimensional stream query language and its formalsemantics. Our approach turns low-level data streams into informative high-level aggregatesand enables multi-dimensional and granular OLAP queries against data streams; whichsupports the requirements of today's real time enterprises much better. A comparison withthe STREAM CQL language shows that our approach is more flexible and powerful for high-level OLAP queries; as well as far more compact and concise.,*,2007,13
Towards a programmable semantic extract-transform-load framework for semantic data warehouses,Rudra Pratap Deb Nath; Katja Hose; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract In order to create better decisions for business analytics; organizations increasinglyuse external data; structured; semi-structured and unstructured; in addition to the (mostlystructured) internal data. Current Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) tools are not suitable for this"open world scenario" because they do not consider semantic issues in the integrationprocess. Also; current ETL tools neither support processing semantic-aware data nor createa Semantic Data Warehouse (DW) as a semantic repository of semantically integrated data.This paper describes SETL: a (Python-based) programmable Semantic ETL framework.SETL builds on Semantic Web (SW) standards and tools and supports developers byoffering a number of powerful modules; classes and methods for (dimensional andsemantic) DW constructs and tasks. Thus it supports semantic-aware data sources …,Proceedings of the ACM Eighteenth International Workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP,2015,12
Handling false negatives in indoor RFID data,Asif Iqbal Baba; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen; Xike Xie,The Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) is a useful technology for object tracking andmonitoring systems in indoor environments; eg; Airport baggage tracking. Nevertheless; thedata produced by RFID tracking is inherently uncertain and contains errors. In order tosupport meaningful high-level applications including queries and analyses over RFID data;it is necessary to cleanse raw RFID data. In this paper; we focus on false negatives in rawindoor RFID tracking data. False negatives occur when a moving object passes thedetection range of an RFID reader but the reader fails to produce any readings. Weinvestigate the topology of indoor spaces as well as the deployment of RFID readers; andpropose the transition probabilities that capture how likely objects move from one RFIDreader to another. We organize such probabilities; together with the characteristics of …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2014 IEEE 15th International Conference on,2014,12
A rule-based tool for gradual granular data aggregation,Nadeem Iftikhar; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract In order to keep more detailed data available for longer periods; old data has to bereduced gradually to save space and improve query performance; especially on resource-constrained systems with limited storage and query processing capabilities. In this regard;some hand-coded data aggregation solutions have been developed; however; their actualusage have been limited; for the reason that hand-coded data aggregation solutions haveproven themselves too complex to maintain. Maintenance need to occur as requirementschange frequently and the existing data aggregation techniques lack flexibility with regardsto efficient requirements change management. This paper presents an effective rule-basedtool for data reduction based on gradual granular data aggregation. With the proposedsolution; data can be maintained at different levels of granularity. The solution is based on …,Proceedings of the ACM 14th international workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP,2011,12
Probabilistic grid-based approaches for privacy preserving data mining on moving object trajectories,Gyözö Gidofalvi; Xuegang Huang; T Bach Pedersen,The efficient management of moving object databases has gained much interest in recentyears due to the development of mobile communication and positioning technologies. Atypical way of representing moving objects is to use the trajectories. Much work has focusedon the topics of indexing; query processing and data mining of moving object trajectories;but little attention has been paid to the preservation of privacy in this setting. In manyapplications such as intelligent transport systems (ITS) and fleet management; floating cardata (FCD); ie; tracked vehicle locations; are collected; and used for mining traffic patterns.For instance; mining vehicle trajectories in urban transportation networks over time caneasily identify dense areas (roads; junctions; etc.); and use this for predicting trafficcongestion.

Optimizing RDF Data Cubes for Efficient Processing of Analytical Queries.,Kim Ahlstrøm Jakobsen; Alex B Andersen; Katja Hose; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract. In today's data-driven world; analytical querying; typically based on the data cubeconcept; is the cornerstone of answering important business questions and making data-driven decisions. Traditionally; the underlying analytical data was mostly internal to theorganization and stored in relational data warehouses and data cubes. Today; external datasources are essential for analytics and; as the Semantic Web gains popularity; more andmore external sources are available in native RDF. With the recent SPARQL 1.1 standard;performing analytical queries over RDF data sources has finally become feasible. However;unlike their relational counterparts; RDF data cubes stores lack optimizations that enablefast querying. In this paper; we present an approach to optimizing RDF data cubes that isbased on three novel cube patterns that optimize RDF data cubes; as well as associated …,COLD,2015,11
Processing aggregate queries in a federation of SPARQL endpoints,Dilshod Ibragimov; Katja Hose; Torben Bach Pedersen; Esteban Zimányi,Abstract More and more RDF data is exposed on the Web via SPARQL endpoints. With therecent SPARQL 1.1 standard; these datasets can be queried in novel and more powerfulways; eg; complex analysis tasks involving grouping and aggregation; and even data frommultiple SPARQL endpoints; can now be formulated in a single query. This enablesBusiness Intelligence applications that access data from federated web sources and cancombine it with local data. However; as both aggregate and federated queries have becomeavailable only recently; state-of-the-art systems lack sophisticated optimization techniquesthat facilitate efficient execution of such queries over large datasets. To overcome theseshortcomings; we propose a set of query processing strategies and the associated Cost-based Optimizer for Distributed Aggregate queries (CoDA) for executing aggregate …,European Semantic Web Conference,2015,11

Model-based integration of past & future in timetravel,Mohamed E Khalefa; Ulrike Fischer; Torben Bach Pedersen; Wolfgang Lehner,Abstract We demonstrate TimeTravel; an efficient DBMS system for seamless integratedquerying of past and (forecasted) future values of time series; allowing the user to view pastand future values as one joint time series. This functionality is important for advancedapplication domain like energy. The main idea is to compactly represent time series asmodels. By using models; the TimeTravel system answers queries approximately on pastand future data with error guarantees (absolute error and confidence) one order ofmagnitude faster than when accessing the time series directly. In addition; it efficientlysupports exact historical queries by only accessing relevant portions of the time series. Thisis unlike existing approaches; which access the entire time series to exactly answer thequery. To realize this system; we propose a novel hierarchical model index structure.

Using aggregation to improve the scheduling of flexible energy offers,Tea Tušar; Laurynas Šikšnys; Torben Bach Pedersen; Erik Dovgan; Bogdan Filipic,Abstract Changing electricity markets call for new ways of handling supply and demand. Thedesired goal is to increase the utilization of renewable energy while ensuring reliable supplyand minimizing the costs. We present an approach aiming at this goal that handles a largenumber of flexible energy offers from producers and consumers by aggregating them andscheduling these aggregates to minimize a cost function. We explore the influence ofaggregation on the performance of scheduling; establishing that a trade-off betweenkeeping the flexibilities of flexible offers and reducing their number is what yields the bestresults.,Proc. of BIOMA,2012,11
Implementing sentinels in the targit bi suite,Morten Middelfart; Torben Bach Pedersen,This paper describes the implementation of so-called sentinels in the TARGIT BI Suite.Sentinels are a novel type of rules that can warn a user if one or more measure changes in amulti-dimensional data cube are expected to cause a change to another measure critical tothe user. Sentinels notify users based on previous observations; eg; that revenue might dropwithin two months if an increase in customer problems combined with a decrease in websitetraffic is observed. In this paper we show how users; without any prior technical knowledge;can mine and use sentinels in the TARGIT BI Suite. We present in detail how sentinels aremined from data; and how sentinels are scored.

QB2OLAP: Enabling OLAP on statistical linked open data,Jovan Varga; Lorena Etcheverry; Alejandro A Vaisman; Oscar Romero; Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian Thomsen,Publication and sharing of multidimensional (MD) data on the Semantic Web (SW) opensnew opportunities for the use of On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP). The RDF Data Cube(QB) vocabulary; the current standard for statistical data publishing; however; lacks key MDconcepts such as dimension hierarchies and aggregate functions. QB4OLAP was proposedto remedy this. However; QB4OLAP requires extensive manual annotation and users muststill write queries in SPARQL; the standard query language for RDF; which typical OLAPusers are not familiar with. In this demo; we present QB2OLAP; a tool for enabling OLAP onexisting QB data. Without requiring any RDF; QB (4OLAP); or SPARQL skills; it allows semi-automatic transformation of a QB data set into a QB4OLAP one via enrichment withQB4OLAP semantics; exploration of the enriched schema; and querying with the high …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,10
Finding dense locations in indoor tracking data,Tanvir Ahmed; Torben Bach Pedersen; Hua Lu,Finding the dense locations in large indoor spaces is very useful for getting overloadedlocations; security; crowd management; indoor navigation; and guidance. Indoor trackingdata can be very large and are not readily available for finding dense locations. This paperpresents a graph-based model for semi-constrained indoor movement; and then uses this tomap raw tracking records into mapping records representing object entry and exit times inparticular locations. Then; an efficient indexing structure; the Dense Location Time Index(DLT-Index) is proposed for indexing the time intervals of the mapping table; along withassociated construction; query processing; and pruning techniques. The DLT-Index supportsvery efficient aggregate point queries; interval queries; and dense location queries.

3XL: Supporting efficient operations on very large OWL Lite triple-stores,Xiufeng Liu; Christian Thomsen; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract An increasing number of (semantic) web applications store a very large number of(subject; predicate; object) triples in specialized storage engines called triple-stores. Often;triple-stores are used mainly as plain data stores; ie; for inserting and retrieving largeamounts of triples; but not using more advanced features such as logical inference; etc.However; current triple-stores are not optimized for such bulk operations and/or do notsupport OWL Lite. Further; triple-stores can be inflexible when the data has to be integratedwith other kinds of data in non-triple form; eg; standard relational data. This paper presents3XL; a triple-store that efficiently supports operations on very large amounts of OWL Litetriples. 3XL also provides the user with high flexibility as it stores data in an object-relationaldatabase in a schema that is easy to use and understand. It is; thus; easy to integrate 3XL …,Information Systems,2011,10
Dimensional enrichment of statistical linked open data,Jovan Varga; Alejandro A Vaisman; Oscar Romero; Lorena Etcheverry; Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian Thomsen,Abstract On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) is a data analysis technique typically usedfor local and well-prepared data. However; initiatives like Open Data and Open Governmentbring new and publicly available data on the web that are to be analyzed in the same way.The use of semantic web technologies for this context is especially encouraged by theLinked Data initiative. There is already a considerable amount of statistical linked open datasets published using the RDF Data Cube Vocabulary (QB) which is designed for thesepurposes. However; QB lacks some essential schema constructs (eg; dimension levels) tosupport OLAP. Thus; the QB4OLAP vocabulary has been proposed to extend QB with thenecessary constructs and be fully compliant with OLAP.

Only recently; the Danish government has joined themovement and published several datasets as Open Data. These raw datasets are difficult toprocess automatically and combine with other data sources on the Web. Hence; our goal isto convert such data into RDF and make it available to a broader range of users andapplications as Linked Open Data. In this paper; we discuss our experiences based on theparticularly interesting use case of agricultural data as agriculture is one of the mostimportant industries in Denmark. We describe the process of converting the data anddiscuss the particular problems that we encountered with respect to the considered datasets.We additionally evaluate our result based on several queries that could not be answered …,Joint International Semantic Technology Conference,2014,9
Music warehouses: Challenges for the next generation of music search engines,François Deliege; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract. Music Information Retrieval has received increasing attention from both theindustrial and the research communities in recent years. Many audio extraction techniquesproviding content-based music information have been developed; sparking the need forintelligent storage and retrieval facilities. This paper proposes to satisfy this need byextending technology from business-oriented data warehouses to so-called musicwarehouses that integrate a large variety of music-related information; including both low-level features and high-level musical information. Music warehouses thus help to close the“semantic gap” by supporting integrated querying of these two kinds of music data. Thispaper presents a number of new challenges for the database community that must be takenup to meet the particular demands of music warehouses.,Proc. of LSAS,2006,9
Evaluating the value of flexibility in energy regulation markets,Bijay Neupane; Torben Bach Pedersen; Bo Thiesson,Abstract In this paper; we perform an econometric analysis on the benefits of introducingflexibility in the Danish/Nordic regulating power market. The paper investigates therelationships between market power prices and regulation volumes; in order to quantify theeffects of flexibility on regulating power prices. Further; we analyze the benefit for varioustypes of flexibility and market objectives; to detect the type of energy flexibility that maximizesthe benefits. Results show that if 3.87% of total demand is flexible; the market can reduce theregulation cost by 49% and the regulation volume by 29.4%.,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM Sixth International Conference on Future Energy Systems,2015,8
Capturing hotspots for constrained indoor movement,Tanvir Ahmed; Torben Bach Pedersen; Hua Lu,Abstract Finding the hotspots in large indoor spaces is very important for getting overloadedlocations; security; crowd management; indoor navigation and guidance. The tracking datacoming from indoor tracking are huge in volume and not readily available for findinghotspots. This paper presents a graph-based model for constrained indoor movement thatcan map the tracking records into mapping records which represent the entry and exit timesof an object in a particular location. Then it discusses the hotspots extraction technique fromthe mapping records.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2013,8
Finding traffic-aware fastest paths in spatial networks,Shuo Shang; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen; Xike Xie,Abstract Route planning and recommendation have received significant attention in recentyears. In this light; we propose and investigate the novel problem of finding traffic-awarefastest paths (TAFP query) in spatial networks by considering the related traffic conditions.Given a sequence of user specified intended places O q and a departure time t; TAFP findsthe fastest path connecting O q in order to guarantee that moving objects (eg; travelers andbags) can arrive at the destination in time. This type of query is mainly motivated by indoorspace applications; but is also applicable in outdoor space; and we believe that it may bringimportant benefits to users in many popular applications; such as tracking VIP bags inairports and recommending convenient routes to travelers. TAFP is challenged by twodifficulties:(i) how to model the traffic awareness practically; and (ii) how to evaluate TAFP …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2013,8
Modeling of traffic-aware travel time in spatial networks,Shuo Shang; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen; Xike Xie,Route evaluation and optimization have received significant attention in recent years. In thislight; we propose and investigate a novel problem of estimating the travel time (TTE query)for a user specified path by considering the related traffic conditions. Given a query path anda departure time; TTE query finds the estimated travel time along this path. We believe thatthis type of query may bring important benefits to users in many popular applications; suchas travel route evaluation and optimization; and route planning and recommendation. Toaddress the TTE problem in a convincing approach; we construct a traffic-aware spatialnetwork G pt (V; E) by analysing uncertain trajectory data of moving objects. Based on G pt(V; E); we define two novel types of TTE queries: TTE ep for an exact query path; and TTE lpfor a loose query path.

Using sentinel technology in the targit bi suite,Morten Middelfart; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract This paper demonstrates so-called sentinels in the TARGIT BI Suite. Sentinels are anovel type of rules that can warn a user if one or more measure changes in a multi-dimensional data cube are expected to cause a change to another measure critical to theuser. We present the concept of sentinels; and we explain how sentinels represent strongerand more specific rules than sequential patterns and correlation techniques. In addition; wepresent the algorithm; implementation; and data warehouse setup that are prerequisites forour demo. In the demo we present a dialogue where users; without any prior technicalknowledge; are able to select a critical measure; a number of cubes; and a time dimension;and subsequently mine and schedule sentinels for early warnings.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,8
The decoration operator: A foundation for on-line dimensional data integration,Dennis Pedersen; Torben Bach Pedersen; Karsten Riis,The changing data requirements of today's dynamic business environments are not handledwell by current on-line analytical processing (OLAP) systems. Physically integratingunexpected; external data into OLAP cubes; ie; the data warehousing approach; is a longand time-consuming process; making logical; on-the-fly; integration the better choice inmany situations. However; OLAP systems have no operations for integrating existingmultidimensional cube data with external data. In This work we present a novelmultidimensional algebra operator; the decoration operator; which allows external data to beintegrated in OLAP cubes as new dimensions; ie; the cube is" decorated" with newdimensions which can subsequently be used just as the regular dimensions. We formallyspecify the semantics of the decoration operator; ensuring that semantic problems do not …,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2004. IDEAS'04. Proceedings.

Managing complex multidimensional data,Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Multidimensional database concepts such as cubes; dimensions with hierarchies;and measures are a cornerstone of business intelligence. However; the standard datamodels and system implementations (OLAP) for multidimensional databases are sometimesnot able to capture the complexities of advanced real-world application domains. Thislecture will focus on how to manage such complex multidimensional data; including complexdimension hierarchies; complex measures; and integration of multidimensional data withcomplex external data. We will look at how complex multidimensional data emerge incomplex application domains such as medical data; location-based services; music data;web data; and text data; and present solutions for these domains that supportmultidimensional business intelligence.,European Business Intelligence Summer School,2012,7
The meta-morphing model used in TARGIT BI suite,Morten Middelfart; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract This paper presents the meta-morphing model and its practical application in anindustry strength business intelligence solution. The meta-morphing model addsassociations between measures and dimensions to a traditional multi-dimensional cubemodel; and thus facilitates a process where users are able to ask questions to a businessintelligence (BI) system without the constraints of a traditional system. In addition; the modelwill learn the user's presentation preferences and thereby reduce the number of interactionsneeded to present the answer. The nature of meta-morphing means that users can askquestions that are incomplete and thereby experience the system as a more intuitiveplatform than state-of-art.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2011,7
Gradual data aggregation in multi-granular fact tables on resource-constrained systems,Nadeem Iftikhar; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Multi-granular fact tables are used to store and query data at different levels ofgranularity. In order to collect data in multi-granular fact tables on a resource-constrainedsystem and to keep it for a long time; we gradually aggregate data to save space; however;still allowing analysis queries; for example; for maintenance purposes etc. to work andgenerate valid results even after aggregation. However; ineffective means of dataaggregation is one of the main factors that can not only reduce performance of the queriesbut also leads to erroneous reporting. This paper presents effective methods for datareduction that are developed to perform gradual data aggregation in multi-granular facttables on resource-constrained systems. With the gradual data aggregation mechanism;older data can be made coarse-grained while keeping the newest data fine-grained.

Discovering sentinel rules for business intelligence,Morten Middelfart; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract This paper proposes the concept of sentinel rules for multi-dimensional data thatwarns users when measure data concerning the external environment changes. Forinstance; a surge in negative blogging about a company could trigger a sentinel rulewarning that revenue will decrease within two months; so a new course of action can betaken. Hereby; we expand the window of opportunity for organizations and facilitatesuccessful navigation even though the world behaves chaotically. Since sentinel rules are atthe schema level as opposed to the data level; and operate on data changes as opposed toabsolute data values; we are able to discover strong and useful sentinel rules that wouldotherwise be hidden when using sequential pattern mining or correlation techniques. Wepresent a method for sentinel rule discovery and an implementation of this method that …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2009,7
High-Level Audio Features: Distributed Extraction and Similarity Search.,François Deliege; Bee Yong Chua; Torben Bach Pedersen,ABSTRACT Today; automatic extraction of high-level audio features suffers from two mainscalability issues. First; the extraction algorithms are very demanding in terms of memoryand computation resources. Second; copyright laws prevent the audio files to be sharedamong computers; limiting the use of existing distributed computation frameworks andreducing the transparency of the methods evaluation process. The iSound MusicWarehouse (iSoundMW); presented in this paper; is a framework to collect and query high-level audio features. It performs the feature extraction in a two-step process that allowsdistributed computations while respecting copyright laws. Using public computers; theextraction can be performed on large scale music collections. However; to be truly valuable;data management tools to search among the extracted features are needed.

Optimizing aggregate SPARQL queries using materialized RDF views,Dilshod Ibragimov; Katja Hose; Torben Bach Pedersen; Esteban Zimányi,Abstract During recent years; more and more data has been published as native RDFdatasets. In this setup; both the size of the datasets and the need to process aggregatequeries represent challenges for standard SPARQL query processing techniques. Toovercome these limitations; materialized views can be created and used as a source ofprecomputed partial results during query processing. However; materialized viewtechniques as proposed for relational databases do not support RDF specifics; such asincompleteness and the need to support implicit (derived) information. To overcome thesechallenges; this paper proposes MARVEL (MAterialized Rdf Views with Entailment andincompLetness). The approach consists of a view selection algorithm based on anassociated RDF-specific cost model; a view definition syntax; and an algorithm for …,International Semantic Web Conference,2016,6
Towards a unified model of outdoor and indoor spaces,Sari Haj Hussein; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Geographic information systems traditionally dealt with only outdoor spaces. Inrecent years; indoor spatial information systems have started to attract attention partly due tothe increasing use of receptor devices (eg; RFID readers or wireless sensor networks) inboth outdoor and indoor spaces. Applications that employ these devices are expected tospan uniformly and supply seamless functionality in both outdoor and indoor spaces. Whatmakes this impossible is the current absence of a unified account of these two types ofspaces both in terms of modeling and reasoning about the models. This paper presents aunified model of outdoor and indoor spaces and receptor deployments in these spaces. Themodel is expressive; flexible; and invariant to the segmentation of a space plan; and thereceptor deployment policy. It is focused on partially constrained outdoor and indoor …,Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,2012,6
Efficient discovery of generalized sentinel rules,Morten Middelfart; Torben Bach Pedersen; Jan Krogsgaard,Abstract This paper proposes the concept of generalized sentinel rules (sentinels) andpresents an algorithm for their discovery. Sentinels represent schema level relationshipsbetween changes over time in certain measures in a multi-dimensional data cube. Sentinelsnotify users based on previous observations; eg; that revenue might drop within two monthsif an increase in customer problems combined with a decrease in website traffic is observed.If the vice versa also holds; we have a bi-directional sentinel; which has a higher chance ofbeing causal rather than coincidental. We significantly extend prior work to combine multiplemeasures into better sentinels as well as auto-fitting the best warning period. We introducetwo novel quality measures; Balance and Score; that are used for selecting the bestsentinels. We introduce an efficient algorithm incorporating novel optimization techniques …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2010,6
Enabling Real-Time Business Intelligence,Malu Castellanos; Dayal Umeshwar; Renee Miller,In today's competitive and highly dynamic environment; analyzing data to understand howthe business is performing; and to predict outcomes and trends have become critical. Thetraditional approach to reporting is no longer adequate. Instead users now demand easy-to-use intelligent platforms and applications capable of analyzing realtime data to provideinsight and actionable information at the right time. The end goal is to support better andtimelier decision making; enabled by the availability of up-todate; high-quality information.Although there has been progress in this direction and many companies are introducingproducts toward meeting this goal; there is still a long way to go. In particular; the wholelifecycle of business intelligence requires innovative techniques and methodologies capableof dealing with the requirements imposed by these new generation BI applications.

Distal lengthening of ilio-tibial band by Z-plasty for treating refractory greater trochanteric pain after total hip arthroplasty (Pedersen–Noor operation),Arkan S Sayed-Noor; Eskild Pedersen; Per Wretenberg; Göran O Sjödén,Abstract Introduction The development of greater trochanteric pain (GTP) after total hiparthroplasty (THA) represents a special category. Despite that treatment is mainlyconservative; some patients show poor response and surgical intervention should beconsidered. We propose a new method consisting of distal lengthening of ilio-tibial band(ITB) by Z-plasty. Material and methods Between March 2004 and June 2006; 12 womenwith refractory GTP after THA were operated on using distal ITB lengthening. The procedurewas done under local anaesthesia on an outpatient basis. The patients were followed up 3–4 months postoperatively by phone interview and at 1–3 years by EQ-5D questionnaire andclinical examination including tenderness evaluation with algometer.

Synchronizing XPath Views,Dennis Pedersen; Torben Bach Pedersen,The increasing availability of XML-based data sources; eg; for publishing data on the WWW;means that more and more applications (data consumers) rely on accessing and using XMLdata. Typically; the access is achieved by defining views over the XML data; and accessingdata through these views. However; the XML data sources are often independent of the dataconsumers and may change their schemas without notification; invalidating the XML viewsdefined by the data consumers. This requires the view definitions to be updated to reflect thenew structure of the data sources; a process termed view synchronization. XPath is the mostcommonly used language for retrieving parts of XML documents; and is thus an importantcornerstone for XML view definitions. This work presents techniques for discovering schemachanges in XML data sources and synchronizing XPath-based views to reflect these …,Database Engineering and Applications Symposium; 2004. IDEAS'04.

SETL: A programmable semantic extract-transform-load framework for semantic data warehouses,Rudra Pratap Deb Nath; Katja Hose; Torben Bach Pedersen; Oscar Romero,Abstract In order to create better decisions for business analytics; organizations increasinglyuse external structured; semi-structured; and unstructured data in addition to the (mostlystructured) internal data. Current Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) tools are not suitable for this“open world scenario” because they do not consider semantic issues in the integrationprocessing. Current ETL tools neither support processing semantic data nor create asemantic Data Warehouse (DW); a repository of semantically integrated data. This paperdescribes our programmable Semantic ETL (SETL) framework. SETL builds on SemanticWeb (SW) standards and tools and supports developers by offering a number of powerfulmodules; classes; and methods for (dimensional and semantic) DW constructs and tasks.Thus it supports semantic data sources in addition to traditional data sources; semantic …,Information Systems,2017,5
Real-time data analytics and event detection for iot-enabled communication systems,Muhammad Intizar Ali; Naomi Ono; Mahedi Kaysar; Zia Ush Shamszaman; Thu-Le Pham; Feng Gao; Keith Griffin; Alessandra Mileo,Abstract Enterprise Communication Systems are designed in such a way to maximise theefficiency of communication and collaboration within the enterprise. With users becomingmobile; the Internet of Things (IoT) can play a crucial role in this process; but is far frombeing seamlessly integrated into modern online communications. In this paper; we present asemantic infrastructure for gathering; integrating and reasoning upon heterogeneous;distributed and continuously changing data streams by means of semantic technologies andrule-based inference. Our solution exploits semantics to go beyond today's ad-hocintegration and processing of heterogeneous data sources for static and streaming data.

Mining risk factors in RFID baggage tracking data,Tanvir Ahmed; Toon Calders; Torben Bach Pedersen,Airport baggage management is a significant part of the aviation industry. However; forseveral reasons every year a vast number of bags are mishandled (eg; Left behind; send towrong flights; gets lost; etc.;) which costs a lot of money to the aviation industry as well ascreates inconvenience and frustration to the passengers. To remedy these problems wepropose a detailed methodology for mining risk factors from Radio Frequency Identification(RFID) baggage tracking data. The factors should identify potential issues in the baggagemanagement. However; the baggage tracking data are low level and not directly accessiblefor finding such factors. Moreover; baggage tracking data are highly imbalanced; forexample; our experimental data; which is a large real-world data set from the Scandinaviancountries; contains only 0.8% mishandled bags.

Measuring and Comparing Energy Flexibilities.,Emmanouil Valsomatzis; Katja Hose; Torben Bach Pedersen; Laurynas Siksnys,ABSTRACT Flexibility in energy supply and demand becomes more and more importantwith increasing Renewable Energy Sources (RES) production and the emergence of theSmart Grid. Socalled prosumers; ie; entities that produce and/or consume energy; can offertheir inherent flexibilities through so-called demand response and thus help stabilize theenergy markets. Thus; prosumer flexibility becomes valuable and the ongoing Danishproject TotalFlex [1] explores the use of prosumer flexibility in the energy market using theconcept of a flex-offer [2]; which captures energy flexibilities in time and/or amount explicitly.However; in order to manage and price the flexibilities of flex-offers effectively; we must firstbe able to measure these flexibilities and compare them to each other. In this paper; wepropose a number of possible flexibility definitions for flex-offers. We consider flexibility …,EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2015,5
SM4AM: A semantic metamodel for analytical metadata,Jovan Varga; Oscar Romero; Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian Thomsen,Abstract Next generation BI systems emerge as platforms where traditional BI tools meetsemi-structured and unstructured data coming from the Web. In these settings; the user-centric orientation represents a key characteristic for the acceptance and wide usage bynumerous and diverse end users in their data analysis tasks. System and user relatedmetadata are the base for enabling user assistance features. However; current approachestypically store these metadata in ad-hoc manners. In this paper; we propose a generic andextensible approach for the definition and modeling of the relevant metadata artifacts.

Reasoning about RFID-tracked moving objects in symbolic indoor spaces,Sari Haj Hussein; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract In recent years; indoor spatial data management has started to attract attention;partly due to the increasing use of receptor devices (eg; RFID readers; and wireless sensornetworks) in indoor; as well as outdoor spaces. There is thus a great need for a model thatcaptures such spaces; their receptors; and provides powerful reasoning techniques on top.This paper reviews and extends a recent unified model of outdoor and indoor spaces andreceptor deployments in these spaces. The extended model enables modelers to capturevarious information pieces from the physical world. On top of the extended model; this paperproposes and formalizes the route observability concept; and demonstrates its usefulness inenhancing the reading environment. The extended model also enables incorporatingreceptor data through a probabilistic trajectory-to-route translator.

Optimizing notifications of subscription-based forecast queries,Ulrike Fischer; Matthias Böhm; Wolfgang Lehner; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Integrating sophisticated statistical methods into database management systems isgaining more and more attention in research and industry. One important statistical methodis time series forecasting; which is crucial for decision management in many domains. In thiscontext; previous work addressed the processing of ad-hoc and recurring forecast queries.In contrast; we focus on subscription-based forecast queries that arise when an application(subscriber) continuously requires forecast values for further processing. Forecast queriesexhibit the unique characteristic that the underlying forecast model is updated with each newactual value and better forecast values might be available. However;(re-) sending newforecast values to the subscriber for every new value is infeasible because this can causesignificant overhead at the subscriber side. The subscriber therefore wishes to be notified …,International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2012,5
ETLDiff: a semi-automatic framework for regression test of ETL software,Christian Thomsen; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Modern software development methods such as Extreme Programming (XP) favorthe use of frequently repeated tests; so-called regression tests; to catch new errors whensoftware is updated or tuned; by checking that the software still produces the right results fora reference input. Regression testing is also very valuable for Extract–Transform–Load(ETL) software; as ETL software tends to be very complex and error-prone. However;regression testing of ETL software is currently cumbersome and requires large manualefforts. In this paper; we describe a novel; easy–to–use; and efficient semi–automatic testframework for regression test of ETL software. By automatically analyzing the schema; thetool detects how tables are related; and uses this knowledge; along with optional userspecifications; to determine exactly what data warehouse (DW) data should be identical …,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2006,5
Aggregating energy flexibilities under constraints,Emmanouil Valsomatzis; Torben Bach Pedersen; Alberto Abelló; Katja Hose,The flexibility of individual energy prosumers (producers and/or consumers) has drawn a lotof attention in recent years. Aggregation of such flexibilities provides prosumers with theopportunity to directly participate in the energy market and at the same time reduces thecomplexity of scheduling the energy units. However; aggregated flexibility should supportnormal grid operation. In this paper; we build on the flex-offer (FO) concept to model theinherent flexibility of a prosumer (eg; a single flexible consumption device such as a clotheswasher). An FO captures flexibility in both time and amount dimensions. We define theproblem of aggregating FOs taking into account grid power constraints. We also propose twoconstraint-based aggregation techniques that efficiently aggregate FOs while retainingflexibility. We show through a comprehensive evaluation that our techniques; in contrast …,Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm); 2016 IEEE International Conference on,2016,4
Learning-based cleansing for indoor RFID data,Asif Iqbal Baba; Manfred Jaeger; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen; Wei-Shinn Ku; Xike Xie,Abstract RFID is widely used for object tracking in indoor environments; eg; airport baggagetracking. Analyzing RFID data offers insight into the underlying tracking systems as well asthe associated business processes. However; the inherent uncertainty in RFID data;including noise (cross readings) and incompleteness (missing readings); pose challenges tohigh-level RFID data querying and analysis. In this paper; we address these challenges byproposing a learning-based data cleansing approach that; unlike existing approaches;requires no detailed prior knowledge about the spatio-temporal properties of the indoorspace and the RFID reader deployment. Requiring only minimal information about RFIDdeployment; the approach learns relevant knowledge from raw RFID data and uses it tocleanse the data. In particular; we model raw RFID readings as time series that are …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,4
Dependency-based FlexOffers: scalable management of flexible loads with dependencies,Laurynas Šikšnys; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Smart grid actors such as aggregators need scalable yet simple and powerful waysto aggregate; optimize; and disaggregate large collections of flexible loads (eg; from heat-pumps and electric vehicles) based on models of flexible loads; eg; state-space models.Based on system-and user-specific variables and constraints; eg; power or temperaturebounds; such models specify dependencies between system inputs; states; and energyamounts consumed/produced at discrete time intervals. Traditional approaches; using exactor simple approximate models; do not scale well; introduce errors; or unacceptably reducethe flexibility (solution space) when total energy needs to be optimized for many timeintervals while respecting a large number of model constraints.

SpotADAPT: Spot-Aware (re-) Deployment of Analytical Processing Tasks on Amazon EC2,Dalia Kaulakienė; Christian Thomsen; Torben Bach Pedersen; Ugur Çetintemel; Tim Kraska,Abstract Having constantly increasing amounts of data; the analysis of it is often entrusted fora MapReduce framework. The execution of an analytical workload can be cheapened byadopting cloud computing resources; and in particular by using spot instances (cheap;fluctuating price instances) offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The users aiming forthe spot market are presented with many instance types placed in multiple datacenters in theworld; and thus it is difficult to choose the optimal deployment.

MOST: Mobile broadband network optimization using planned spatio-temporal events,Saulius Samulevicius; Torben Bach Pedersen; Troels Bundgaard Sorensen,Continuous optimization of Mobile Broadband Networks (MBNs) is done to simultaneouslyoptimize and balance some performance factors such as Quality of Service (QoS) andenergy usage. Initial MBN optimization approaches used various heuristics; while moreadvanced approaches have investigated the MBN optimization potential using predictions offuture node loads based on historical load data. However; using only historical load data forprediction often fails when events occur. This paper presents MOST (Mobile broadbandnetwork Optimization using planned Spatio-Temporal events) approach that additionallyuses external spatio-temporal information about planned events; eg; the time and place ofbig concerts or football matches; to improve the prediction quality; thus enabling morecorrect MBN optimization.

Balancing energy flexibilities through aggregation,Emmanouil Valsomatzis; Katja Hose; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract One of the main goals of recent developments in the Smart Grid area is to increasethe use of renewable energy sources. These sources are characterized by energyfluctuations that might lead to energy imbalances and congestions in the electricity grid.Exploiting inherent flexibilities; which exist in both energy production and consumption; isthe key to solving these problems. Flexibilities can be expressed as flex-offers; which due totheir high number need to be aggregated to reduce the complexity of energy scheduling. Inthis paper; we discuss balance aggregation techniques that already during aggregation aimat balancing flexibilities in production and consumption to reduce the probability ofcongestions and reduce the complexity of scheduling. We present results of our extensiveexperiments.,International Workshop on Data Analytics for Renewable Energy Integration,2014,4
Spatio-temporal ensemble prediction on mobile broadband network data,Saulius Samulevicius; Yoann Pitarch; Torben Bach Pedersen; Troels Bundgaard Sorensen,Facing the huge success of mobile devices; network providers ceaselessly deploy newnodes (cells) to always guarantee a high quality of service. Nevertheless; keeping turned onall the nodes when traffic is low is energy inefficient. This has led to investigations on thepossibility to turn off network nodes; fully or partly; in low traffic loads. To accomplish such adynamic network optimization; it is crucial to predict very accurately low traffic periods. In thispaper; we tackle this problem using data mining and propose Spatio-Temporal EnsemblePrediction (STEP). In a nutshell; STEP is based on the following two main ideas:(1) sincetraffic shows very different behaviors depending on both the temporal and the spatialcontexts; several prediction models are built to fit these characteristics;(2) we propose anensemble prediction technique that accurately predicts low traffic periods.

Time Series Management Systems: A Survey,Søren Kejser Jensen; Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian Thomsen,The collection of time series data increases as more monitoring and automation are beingdeployed. These deployments range in scale from an Internet of things (IoT) device locatedin a household to enormous distributed Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) producing largevolumes of data at high velocity. To store and analyze these vast amounts of data;specialized Time Series Management Systems (TSMSs) have been developed to overcomethe limitations of general purpose Database Management Systems (DBMSs) for times seriesmanagement. In this paper; we present a thorough analysis and classification of TSMSsdeveloped through academic or industrial research and documented through publications.Our classification is organized into categories based on the architectures observed duringour analysis. In addition; we provide an overview of each system with a focus on the …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017,3
Solvedb: Integrating optimization problem solvers into sql databases,Laurynas Šikšnys; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Many real-world decision problems involve solving optimization problems based ondata in an SQL database. Traditionally; solving such problems requires combining a DBMSwith optimization software packages for each required class of problems (eg linear andconstraint programming)--leading to workflows that are cumbersome; complex; inefficient;and error-prone. In this paper; we present SolveDB-a DBMS for optimization applications.SolveDB supports solvers for different problem classes and offers seamless datamanagement and optimization problem solving in a pure SQL-based setting. This allows formuch simpler and more effective solutions of database-based optimization problems.SolveDB is based on the 3-level ANSI/SPARC architecture and allows formulating; solving;and analysing solutions of optimization problems using a single so-called solve query …,Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2016,3
Efficient approximate olap querying over time series,Kasun S Perera; Martin Hahmann; Wolfgang Lehner; Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian Thomsen,Abstract The ongoing trend for data gathering not only produces larger volumes of data; butalso increases the variety of recorded data types. Out of these; especially time series; egvarious sensor readings; have attracted attention in the domains of business intelligenceand decision making. As OLAP queries play a major role in these domains; it is desirable toalso execute them on time series data. While this is not a problem on the conceptual level; itcan become a bottleneck with regards to query run-time. In general; processing OLAPqueries gets more computationally intensive as the volume of data grows. This is a particularproblem when querying time series data; which generally contains multiple measuresrecorded at fine time granularities. Usually; this issue is addressed either by scaling uphardware or by employing workload based query optimization techniques.

Towards constraint-based aggregation of energy flexibilities,Emmanouil Valsomatzis; Torben Bach Pedersen; Alberto Abelló; Katja Hose; Laurynas Šikšnys,Abstract The aggregation of energy flexibilities enables individual producers and/orconsumers with small loads to directly participate in the emerging energy markets. On theother hand; aggregation of such flexibilities might also create problems to the operation ofthe electrical grid. In this paper; we present the problem of aggregating energy flexibilitiestaking into account grid capacity limitations and introduce a heuristic aggregation technique.We show through an experimental setup that our proposed technique; compared to abaseline approach; not only leads to a valid unit commitment result that respects the gridconstraint; but it also improves the quality of the result.,Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Future Energy Systems Poster Sessions,2016,3
OLAP over probabilistic data cubes I: Aggregating; materializing; and querying,Xike Xie; Xingjun Hao; Torben Bach Pedersen; Peiquan Jin; Jinchuan Chen,On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) enables powerful analytics by quickly computingaggregate values of numerical measures over multiple hierarchical dimensions for massivedatasets. However; many types of source data; eg; from GPS; sensors; and othermeasurement devices; are intrinsically inaccurate (imprecise and/or uncertain) and thusOLAP cannot be readily applied. In this paper; we address the resulting data veracityproblem in OLAP by proposing the concept of probabilistic data cubes. Such a cube iscomprised of a set of probabilistic cuboids which summarize the aggregated values in theform of probability mass functions (pmfs in short) and thus offer insights into the underlyingdata quality and enable confidence-aware query evaluation and analysis. However; theprobabilistic nature of data poses computational challenges as even simple operations …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,3
A foundation for spatial data warehouses on the semantic web,Nurefşan Gür; Torben Bach Pedersen; Esteban Zimányi; Katja Hose,Abstract Large volumes of geospatial data are being published on the Semantic Web (SW);yielding a need for advanced analysis of such data. However; existing SW technologies onlysupport advanced analytical concepts such as multidimensional (MD) data warehouses andOnline Analytical Processing (OLAP) over non-spatial SW data. To remedy this need; thispaper presents the QB4SOLAP vocabulary; which supports spatially enhanced MD datacubes over RDF data. The paper also defines a number of Spatial OLAP (SOLAP) operatorsover QB4SOLAP cubes and provides algorithms for generating spatially extended SPARQLqueries from the SOLAP operators. The proposals are validated by applying them to arealistic use case.,Semantic Web,2016,3
Modeling and querying spatial data warehouses on the semantic web,Nurefşan Gür; Katja Hose; Torben Bach Pedersen; Esteban Zimányi,Abstract The Semantic Web (SW) has drawn the attention of data enthusiasts; and alsoinspired the exploitation and design of multidimensional data warehouses; in anunconventional way. Traditional data warehouses (DW) operate over static data. Howevermultidimensional (MD) data modeling approach can be dynamically extended by definingboth the schema and instances of MD data as RDF graphs. The importance and applicabilityof MD data warehouses over RDF is widely studied yet none of the works support a spatiallyenhanced MD model on the SW. Spatial support in DWs is a desirable feature for enhancedanalysis; since adding encoded spatial information of the data allows to query with spatialfunctions. In this paper we propose to empower the spatial dimension of data warehousesby adding spatial data types and topological relationships to the existing QB4OLAP …,Joint International Semantic Technology Conference,2015,3
Modeling large time series for efficient approximate query processing,Kasun S Perera; Martin Hahmann; Wolfgang Lehner; Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian Thomsen,Abstract Evolving customer requirements and increasing competition force businessorganizations to store increasing amounts of data and query them for information at anygiven time. Due to the current growth of data volumes; timely extraction of relevantinformation becomes more and more difficult with traditional methods. In addition;contemporary Decision Support Systems (DSS) favor faster approximations over slowerexact results. Generally speaking; processes that require exchange of data becomeinefficient when connection bandwidth does not increase as fast as the volume of data. Inorder to tackle these issues; compression techniques have been introduced in many areasof data processing. In this paper; we outline a new system that does not query completedatasets but instead utilizes models to extract the requested information.

Effective bitmap indexing for non-metric similarities,Claus A Jensen; Ester M Mungure; Torben Bach Pedersen; Kenneth Sørensen; François Deliège,Abstract An increasing number of applications include recommender systems that have toperform search in a non-metric similarity space; thus creating an increasing demand forefficient yet flexible indexing techniques to facilitate similarity search. This demand is furtherfueled by the growing volume of data available to recommender systems. This paperaddresses the demand in the specific domain of music recommendation. The paperpresents the Music On Demand framework where music retrieval is performed in acontinuous; stream-based fashion. Similarity measures between songs; which are computedon high-dimensional feature spaces; often do not obey the triangular inequality; meaningthat existing indexing techniques for high-dimensional data are infeasible. The mostprominent contribution of the paper is the proposal of an indexing approach that is …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2010,3
Warehousing the world: a vision for data warehouse research,Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Data warehouses (DWs) have become very successful in many enterprises; butonly for relatively simple and traditional types of data. It is now time to extend the benefits ofDWs to a much wider range of data; making it feasible to literally" warehouse the world". Todo this; five unique challenges must be addressed: warehousing data about the physicalworld; integrating structured; semi-structured; and unstructured data in DWs; integrating thepast; the present; and the future; warehousing imperfect data; and ensuring privacy in DWs.,*,2009,3
Pre-Aggregation for Irregular OLAP Hierarchies with the TreeScape System.,Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian S Jensen; Curtis E Dyreson,Abstract We present the TreeScape system which; unlike any other system known to theauthors; enables the reuse of pre-computed aggregate query results involving the kinds ofirregular dimension hierarchies that occur frequently in practice. The system establishes afoundation for obtaining high-performance query processing while precomputing only fewaggregates. It is demonstrated how this reuse of aggregates is enabled through dimensiontransformations that occur transparently to the user.,ICDE Demo Sessions,2001,3
Mobile e-services and their challenges to data warehousing,Christian S.  Jensen; Torben Bach  Pedersen,Abstract. Continued advances in hardware technologies combine to create a new class ofinformation services; termed mobile e-services; or simply m-services; which exploits theadvances in; among others; wireless communications; positioning; and miniaturization.Because the users do not merely interact with the services from behind stationary desktopcomputers; but from a variety of increasingly unobtrusive information appliances while onthe move; location information plays a fundamental role; and new types of services becomeof interest. Such services include tracking; way-finding; traffic management; safety-relatedservices; and mixed-reality games; to name but a few. Data warehousing has the potentialfor playing an essential part in m-services. However; for data warehousing to be successfulin an m-service scenario; new challenges must be met by data warehousing technologies …,Datenbank Rundbrief,2001,3
Location influence in location-based social networks,Muhammad Aamir Saleem; Rohit Kumar; Toon Calders; Xike Xie; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Location-based social networks (LBSN) are social networks complemented withlocation data such as geo-tagged activity data of its users. In this paper; we study how usersof a LBSN are navigating between locations and based on this information we select themost influential locations. In contrast to existing works on influence maximization; we are notper se interested in selecting the users with the largest set of friends or the set of locationsvisited by the most users; instead; we introduce a notion of location influence that capturesthe ability of a set of locations to reach out geographically. We provide an exact on-linealgorithm and a more memory-efficient but approximate variant based on the HyperLogLogsketch to maintain a data structure called Influence Oracle that allows to efficiently find a top-k set of influential locations. Experiments show that our algorithms are efficient and …,Proceedings of the Tenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,2017,2
Enabling spatial OLAP over environmental and farming data with QB4SOLAP,Nurefşan Gür; Katja Hose; Torben Bach Pedersen; Esteban Zimányi,Abstract Governmental organizations and agencies have been making large amounts ofspatial data available on the Semantic Web (SW). However; we still lack efficient techniquesfor analyzing such large amounts of data as we know them from relational databasesystems; eg; multidimensional (MD) data warehouses and On-line Analytical Processing(OLAP). A basic prerequisite to enable such advanced analytics is a well-defined schema;which can be defined using the QB4SOLAP vocabulary that provides sufficient context forspatial OLAP (SOLAP). In this paper; we address the challenging problem of MD queryingwith SOLAP operations on the SW by applying QB4SOLAP to a non-trivial spatial use casebased on real-world open governmental data sets across various spatial domains.

Compression of bitmaps and values,*,The present invention relates to compression of values and bitmaps; and methods thereof.Such methods are configured for operating on a computer system having a word lengtharchitecture of length WL and are based on the observation that not all the bits used for therun-length counter—ie; the fill length field (FL) inhere—are often used; since runs areseldom so long. Contrarily to other compression schemes (eg; WAH); said methods mayassign the unused bits to one or more position list fields (PL; PL1; PL2; PLs); thus boostingthe compression ratio. Moreover; the total length (in terms of number of bits) of theuncompressed data—comprising values or bitmaps—may be stored just once; preferably atthe beginning of the compression; thus dramatically diminishing the storage requirementsfor the compression scheme; since it is not required to keep track of the length of each …,*,2016,2

Unimodeling: A tool for the unified modeling and reasoning in outdoor and indoor spaces,Sari Haj Hussein; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract This paper demonstrates UniModeling; a tool for the unified modeling andreasoning in outdoor and indoor spaces. UniModeling supports constructing unified graphmodels of outdoor and indoor spaces and RFID deployments in these spaces. It enablesprobabilistic incorporation of RFID data that facilitates the tracking of moving objects andenables the search for them to be optimized. Furthermore; UniModeling is empowered withthree reasoning applications that pertain to the positioning of RFID readers in outdoor andindoor spaces and the points of potential traffic (over) load in these spaces. The utility ofUniModeling is demonstrated in concrete steps through applying it to the modeling andreasoning about RFID deployment and baggage handling in an example airport.,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2013,2

FlowPredictor enables spatiotemporal selection; aggregate; nested; and complexqueries to be evaluated using novel algorithms. We illustrate the use of a novel model;called Flow Representation Graph (FRG); in the context of an airport bag handling systemusing an interactive web interface in FlowPredictor. The web interface allows modelling theFRG as well as definition of continuous spatio-temporal queries.

Continuous query processing for actual and predicted object flow in symbolic space,Kenneth Fuglsang Christensen; Lasse Linnerup Christiansen; Torben Bach Pedersen; Jeppe Pihl,Monitoring the actual and predicted flow of receptor-based (eg RFID) moving objects can beuseful in a variety of applications; eg; to predict congestion in an airport bag handling systemor reason about the location of a lost bag. In this paper; we propose the Flow RepresentationGraph (FRG) model; which; unlike earlier work; captures both the actual and predicted flowof moving objects in a symbolic space covering both indoor and outdoor space. Further; theFRG supports time-and value-bound semi-constraints on the object flow; which are useful formodeling important real-world conditions.

MIRABEL–Efficiently managing more renewable energy using explicit demand and supply flexibilities,Andreas Doms; Zoran Marinzek; T Pedersen,Abstract The MIRABEL project has developed a groundbreaking ICT system that fits thefuture liberalised energy sector and enables the integration of much higher rates ofdistributed and renewable energy sources (RES) into the electricity grid. This is done usinga radical novel approach for active demand (and supply) side management in whichelectricity consumers and producers issue explicit so-called flex-offers indicating theiravailable flexibilities in time and electricity amount. The MIRABEL system processes largeamounts of flex-offers in order to balance electricity supply and demand in near real-timeand thus supports the integration of non-schedulable renewable energy sources muchbetter than earlier approaches.,Poster session presented at World Smart Grid Forum,2013,2
3XL: An Efficient DBMS-Based Triple-Store,Xiufeng Liu; Christian Thomsen; Torben Bach Pedersen,This paper demonstrates the use of 3XL; a DBMS-based triple-store for OWL Lite data. 3XLis characterized by its use of a database schema specialized for the data to represent. Thespecialized database schema uses object-relational features--particularly inheritance--andpartitions the data such that it is fast to locate the needed data when it is queried. Further; thegenerated database schema is very intuitive and it is thus easy to integrate the OWL datawith other kinds of data. 3XL offers performance comparable to the leading file-based triple-stores. We will demonstrate (1) how a specialized database schema is generated by 3XLbased on an OWL ontology;(2) how triples are loaded; including how they pass through the3XL system and how 3XL can be configured to fine-tune performance; and (3) how (simpleand complex) queries can be expressed and how they are executed by 3XL.,Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA); 2012 23rd International Workshop on,2012,2

For example; in tree based data acquisition protocols;a collection tree is built that is rooted at the data collection center such as the sink node [8].The dissemination of the data requests from the participating nodes and collection of datafrom the sensor nodes are accomplished using this tree. A cluster based data acquisitionmechanism has been proposed in [3]. As shown in Fig. 1; nodes are organized into a fixednumber of clusters; and nodes within each cluster dynamically elect a cluster head. The dataacquisition is carried out in two phases. In the first phase; cluster heads collect data fromtheir cluster nodes. In the second phase; cluster heads send collected data to the nodes thathave subscribed to the data. The cluster heads are re-elected to balance energyconsumption among the nodes in the cluster. Zhang et al.[13] have proposed an adaptive …,*,2009,2

Dimensional modeling by using a new response to slowly changing dimensions,Lars Frank; Christian Frank; Christian Søndergaard Jensen; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract: Dimensions are defined as dynamic or slowly changing if the attributes orrelationships of a dimension can be updated. Aggregations to dynamic dimensions might bemisleading if the measures are aggregated without regarding the changes of thedimensions. Kimball et al. has described three classic solutions/responses to handling theaggregation problems caused by slowly changing dimensions. In this paper; we willdescribe a fourth solution. A special aspect of our new response is that it should be usedbefore the other responses; as it will change the design of the data warehouse. Afterwards; itmay be necessary to use the classic responses to improve the design further.,International Conference on Information Technology,2005,2
GeoSemOLAP: Geospatial OLAP on the Semantic Web Made Easy,Nurefsan Gür; Jacob Nielsen; Katja Hose; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract The proliferation of spatial data and the publication of multidimensional (MD) dataon the Semantic Web (SW) has led to new opportunities for On-Line Analytical Processing(SOLAP) over spatial data using SPARQL. However; formulating such queries results inverbose statements and can easily become very difficult for inexperienced users. Hence; wehave developed GeoSemOLAP to enable users without detailed knowledge of RDF andSPARQL to query the SW with SOLAP. GeoSemOLAP generates SPARQL queries based onhigh-level SOLAP operators and allows the user to interactively formulate queries using agraphical interface with interactive maps.,Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion,2017,1
Finding dense locations in symbolic indoor tracking data: modeling; indexing; and processing,Tanvir Ahmed; Torben Bach Pedersen; Hua Lu,Abstract Finding the dense locations in large indoor spaces is very useful for manyapplications such as overloaded area detection; security control; crowd management; indoornavigation; and so on. Indoor tracking data can be enormous and are not immediately readyfor finding dense locations. This paper presents two graph-based models for constrainedand semi-constrained indoor movement; respectively; and then uses the models to map rawtracking records into mapping records that represent object entry and exit times in particularlocations. Subsequently; an efficient indexing structure called Hierarchical Dense LocationTime Index (HDLT-Index) is proposed for indexing the time intervals of the mapping table;along with index construction; query processing; and pruning techniques. The HDLT-Indexsupports very efficient aggregate point; interval; and duration queries as well as dense …,GeoInformatica,2017,1
Towards Answering Provenance-Enabled SPARQL Queries Over RDF Data Cubes,Kim Ahlstrøm; Katja Hose; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract The SPARQL 1.1 standard has made it possible to formulate analytical queries inSPARQL. While some approaches have become available for processing analytical querieson RDF data cubes; little attention has been paid to answering provenance-enabled queriesover such data. Yet; considering provenance is a prerequisite to being able to validate if aquery result is trustworthy. The main challenge for existing triple stores is the wayprovenance can be encoded in standard triple stores based on context values (namedgraphs). Hence; in this paper we analyze the suitability of existing triple stores for answeringprovenance-enabled queries on RDF data cubes; identify their shortcomings; and proposean index to handle the high number of context values that provenance encoding typicallyentails.

Distributed convoy pattern mining,Faisal Orakzai; Toon Calders; Torben Bach Pedersen,Due to the wide spread of mobile devices equipped with location sensors; the amount ofmobility data being generated is enormous. Mining this data to reveal interesting behavioralpatterns has gained attention in recent years. Various mobility patterns have been proposedwhich describe collective mobility behaviour. One such pattern is the convoy pattern whichcan be used to find groups of people moving together in public transport or for prevention oftraffic jams. A convoy consists of at least m objects moving together for at least k consecutivetime instants where m and k are user-defined parameters. Existing algorithms for detectingconvoy patterns; however; do not scale to real-life dataset sizes. Therefore in this paper; wepropose a generic distributed convoy pattern mining algorithm and show how such analgorithm can be implemented using the MapReduce framework.

Online risk prediction for indoor moving objects,Tanvir Ahmed; Torben Bach Pedersen; Toon Calders; Hua Lu,Technologies such as RFID and Bluetooth have received considerable attention for trackingindoor moving objects. In a time-critical indoor tracking scenario such as airport baggagehandling; a bag has to move through a sequence of locations until it is loaded into theaircraft. Inefficiency or inaccuracy at any step can make the bag risky; ie; the bag may bedelayed at the airport or sent to a wrong airport. In this paper; we propose a novelprobabilistic approach for predicting the risk of an indoor moving object in real-time. Wepropose a probabilistic flow graph (PFG) and an aggregated probabilistic flow graph (APFG)that capture the historical object transitions and the durations of the transitions. In thegraphs; the probabilistic information is stored in a set of histograms. Then we use the flowgraphs for obtaining a risk score of an online object and use it for predicting its riskiness …,Mobile Data Management (MDM); 2016 17th IEEE International Conference on,2016,1

IMaxer: A Unified System for Evaluating Influence Maximization in Location-based Social Networks,Muhammad Aamir Saleem; Rohit Kumar; Toon Calders; Xike Xie; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Due to the popularity of social networks with geo-tagged activities; so-calledlocation-based social networks (LBSN); a number of methods have been proposed forinfluence maximization for applications such as word-of-mouth marketing (WOMM); and out-of-home marketing (OOH). It is thus important to analyze and compare these differentapproaches. In this demonstration; we present a unified system IMaxer that both provides acomplete pipeline of state-of-the-art and novel models and algorithms for influencemaximization (IM) as well as allows to evaluate and compare IM techniques for a particularscenario. IMaxer allows to select and transform the required data from raw LBSN datasets. Itfurther provides a unified model that utilizes interactions of nodes in an LBSN; ie; users andlocations; for capturing diverse types of information propagations.

Risk Detection and Prediction from Indoor Tracking Data,Tanvir Ahmed; Toon Calders; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Technologies such as RFID and Bluetooth have received considerable attention fortracking indoor moving objects. In a time-critical indoor tracking scenario such as airportbaggage handling; a bag has to move through a sequence of locations until it is loaded intothe aircraft. Inefficiency or inaccuracy at any step can make the bag risky; ie; the bag may bedelayed at the airport or sent to a wrong airport. In this paper; we discuss a risk detectionand a risk prediction method for such kinds of indoor moving objects. We propose a datamining methodology for detecting risk factors from RFID baggage tracking data. The factorsshould identify potential issues in the baggage management. The paper presents theessential steps for pre-processing the unprocessed raw tracking data and discusses how todeal with the class imbalance problem present in the data set.

Activity-Driven Influence Maximization in Social Networks,Rohit Kumar; Muhammad Aamir Saleem; Toon Calders; Xike Xie; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Interaction networks consist of a static graph with a time-stamped list of edges overwhich interaction took place. Examples of interaction networks are social networks whoseusers interact with each other through messages or location-based social networks wherepeople interact by checking in to locations. Previous work on finding influential nodes insuch networks mainly concentrate on the static structure imposed by the interactions or arebased on fixed models for which parameters are learned using the interactions. In two recentworks; however; we proposed an alternative activity data driven approach based on theidentification of influence propagation patterns. In the first work; we identify so-calledinformation-channels to model potential pathways for information spread; while the secondwork exploits how users in a location-based social network check in to locations in order …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2017,*

Cleansing indoor RFID tracking data,Asif Iqbal Baba; Hua Lu; Torben Bach Pedersen; Manfred Jaeger,Abstract The Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has been increasinglydeployed in indoor environments for object tracking and monitoring. However; the uncertaincharacteristics of RFID data; including noise and incompleteness hinder RFID data queryingand analysis at higher levels. Hence; it is of paramount importance to cleanse the RFID datafor such applications. This paper introduces our comprehensive research on cleansing RFIDdata in indoor settings. We focus on two inherent errors in such RFID data: false positives(unexpected cross readings) and false negatives (missing readings). In our proposed graphmodel based approach; we design a probabilistic distance-aware graph to represent theindoor topology; the deployment of RFID readers and their sensing parameters. We alsoaugment the graph with transition probabilities that capture how likely objects move from …,SIGSPATIAL Special,2017,*
SM4MQ: A Semantic Model for Multidimensional Queries,Jovan Varga; Ekaterina Dobrokhotova; Oscar Romero; Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian Thomsen,Abstract On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) is a data analysis approach to supportdecision-making. On top of that; Exploratory OLAP is a novel initiative for the convergence ofOLAP and the Semantic Web (SW) that enables the use of OLAP techniques on SW data.Moreover; OLAP approaches exploit different metadata artifacts (eg; queries) to assist userswith the analysis. However; modeling and sharing of most of these artifacts are typicallyoverlooked. Thus; in this paper we focus on the query metadata artifact in the ExploratoryOLAP context and propose an RDF-based vocabulary for its representation; sharing; andreuse on the SW. As OLAP is based on the underlying multidimensional (MD) data modelwe denote such queries as MD queries and define SM4MQ: A Semantic Model forMultidimensional Queries.

Generation and Evaluation of Flex-Offers from Flexible Electrical Devices,Bijay Neupane; Laurynas Šikšnys; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract There exists an immense potential in utilizing the demand reduction and shiftingpotential (flexibility) of household devices to confront the challenges of intermittentRenewable Energy Sources. However; a widely accepted general flexibility extraction andevaluation process is missing. This paper proposes a generalized Flex-offer Generation andEvaluation Process (FOGEP) that extract flexibility from wet-devices (eg dishwashers);electric vehicles; and heat pumps and capture it in a unified model; a so-called flex-offer.The proposed process analyses the past consumption behavior of a device to automaticallycapture flexibility in its usage. It utilizes two device-level forecasting techniques andalgorithms to capture various attributes and temporal patterns required for flexibilityextraction. Further; the paper evaluates the performance of FOGEP regarding the …,Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Future Energy Systems,2017,*

Unaccounted uncertainty from qPCR efficiency estimates entails uncontrolled false positive rates,Anders E Bilgrau; Steffen Falgreen; Anders Petersen; Malene K Kjeldsen; Julie S Bødker; Hans E Johnsen; Karen Dybkær; Martin Bøgsted,Accurate adjustment for the amplification efficiency (AE) is an important part of real-timequantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) experiments. The most commonly usedcorrection strategy is to estimate the AE by dilution experiments and use this as a plug-inwhen efficiency correcting the Δ Δ C q. Currently; it is recommended to determine the AEwith high precision as this plug-in approach does not account for the AE uncertainty;implicitly assuming an infinitely precise AE estimate. Determining the AE with suchprecision; however; requires tedious laboratory work and vast amounts of biologicalmaterial. Violation of the assumption leads to overly optimistic standard errors of the Δ Δ C q;confidence intervals; and p-values which ultimately increase the type I error rate beyond theexpected significance level. As qPCR is often used for validation it should be a high …,BMC bioinformatics,2016,*

Analytics on Indoor Moving Objects with Applications in Airport Baggage Tracking,Tanvir Ahmed; Toon Calders; Torben Bach TB Pedersen,Abstract A large part of people's lives are spent in indoor spaces such as office anduniversity buildings; shopping malls; subway stations; airports; museums; communitycenters; etc. Such kind of spaces can be very large and paths inside the locations can beconstrained and complex. Deployment of indoor tracking technologies like RFID; Bluetooth;and Wi-Fi can track people and object movements from one symbolic location to anotherwithin the indoor spaces. The resulting tracking data can be massive in volume. Analyzingthese large volumes of tracking data can reveal interesting patterns that can provideopportunities for different types of location-based services; security; indoor navigation;identifying problems in the system; and finally service improvements. In addition to the hugevolume; the structure of the unprocessed raw tracking data is complex in nature and not …,*,2016,*
Automatic acquisition of class disjointness,Daniel Fleischhacker; Johanna Völker; Heiner Stuckenschmidt,Abstract Although it is widely acknowledged that adding class disjointness to ontologiesenables a wide range of interesting applications; this type of axiom is rarely used on today'sSemantic Web. This is due to the enormous skill and effort required to make the necessarymodeling decisions. Automatically generating disjointness axioms could lower the barrier ofentry and lead to a wider spread adoption. Different methods have been proposed for thisautomatic generation. These include supervised; top-down approaches which base theirresults on heterogeneous types of evidence and unsupervised; bottom-up approacheswhich rely solely on the instance data available for the ontology. However; current literatureis missing a thorough comparison of these approaches.

Cloud Intelligence,Torben Bach Pedersen,Cloud Intelligence can be characterized as BI and analytics in; for; and with the cloud. In thecloud refers to the fact that cloud intelligence solutions will be offered “as-a-service”; runningin the cloud rather than at user sites. The cloud intelligence services should be dynamicallyscalable to a global level. Thus; massively parallel computing techniques such asMapReduce; and beyond are the standard underlying computing platform. Another aspect ofrunning on a cloud platform is the fundamentally new economic model needed for cloudintelligence. In traditional BI; the (large) cost of building a BI system is initially covered by anenterprise investment which must later be paid back through savings or new earnings in theenterprise. In cloud intelligence; there will typically no longer be a central entity paying thebill. Instead; pay-asyou-go models that allow users to pay (a small amount) per use; eg; of …,*,2016,*
DeMand: A Tool for Evaluating and Comparing Device-Level Demand and Supply Forecast Models.,Bijay Neupane; Laurynas Siksnys; Torben Bach Pedersen,ABSTRACT Fine-grained device-level predictions of both shiftable and nonshiftable energydemand and supply is vital in order to take advantage of Demand Response (DR) forefficient utilization of Renewable Energy Sources. The selection of an effective device-levelload forecast model is a challenging task; mainly due to the diversity of the models and thelack of proper tools and datasets that can be used to validate them. In this paper; weintroduce the DeMand system for fine-tuning; analyzing; and validating the device-levelforecast models. The system offers several built-in device-level measurement datasets;forecast models; features; and errors measures; thus semi-automating most of the steps ofthe forecast model selection and validation process.

Using Closed n-set Patterns for Spatio-Temporal Classification,S Samulevičius; Yoann Pitarch; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract Today; huge volumes of sensor data are collected from many different sources. Oneof the most crucial data mining tasks considering this data is the ability to predict and classifydata to anticipate trends or failures and take adequate steps. While the initial data might beof limited interest itself; the use of additional information; eg; latent attributes; spatio-temporaldetails; etc.; can add significant values and interestingness. In this paper we present aclassification approach; called Closed n-set Spatio-Temporal Classification (CnSC); which isbased on the use of latent attributes; pattern mining; and classification model construction.As the amount of generated patterns is huge; we employ a scalable NoSQL-based graphdatabase for efficient storage and retrieval. By considering hierarchies in the latentattributes; we define pattern and context similarity scores.

Lattice-based spatio-temporal ensemble prediction,Saulius Samulevičius; Yoann Pitarch; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract With the rapidly increasing deployment of sensor networks; large amounts of timeseries data are generated. One of the main challenges when dealing with such data isperforming accurate predictions in order to address a broad class of application problems;ranging from mobile broadband network (MBN) optimization to preventive maintenance. Tothis end; time series prediction has been widely addressed by the statistics community.Nevertheless; such approaches fail in performing well when the data are more context-dependent than history-dependent. In this paper; we investigate how latent attributes can bebuilt upon the time series in order to define a spatio-temporal context for predictions.Moreover; such attributes are often hierarchical; leading to multiple potential contexts atdifferent levels of granularity for performing a given prediction.

Further; the generated database schema is very intuitive and it is thus easy tointegrate the OWL data with other kinds of data. 3XL offers performance comparable to theleading file-based triple-stores. We will demonstrate 1) how a specialized database schemais generated by 3XL based on an OWL ontology; 2) how triples are loaded; including howthey pass through the 3XL system and how 3XL can be configured to fine-tune performance;and 3) how (simple and complex) queries can be expressed and how they are executed …,International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems ApplicationsDatabase and Expert Systems Applications,2012,*

Hierarchy,Torben Bach Pedersen,A hash function is a well-defined deterministic algorithm that takes as input data of arbitrarylength and produces a short fixed-length digital representation of the data; or a digest; as itsoutput. The output of a hash function can serve the role of a digital ''fingerprint''of the inputdata; as an important design property of hash functions is that of collision resilience: twohashes produced on different inputs are very unlikely to result in the same value.Furthermore; given a hash function output; it is normally infeasible to find a (previouslyunseen) input that matches that output (this property is called preimage resistance).,*,2009,*

Combining Data Warehousing and Data Mining Techniques for Web Log Analysis,Torben Bach Pedersen; Jesper Thorhauge; Søren E Jespersen,Abstract Enormous amounts of information about Web site user behavior are collected inWeb server logs. However; this information is only useful if it can be queried and analyzed toprovide high-level knowledge about user navigation patterns; a task that requires powerfultechniques. This chapter presents a number of approaches that combine data warehousingand data mining techniques in order to analyze Web logs. After introducing the well-knownclick and session data warehouse (DW) schemas; the chapter presents the subsessionschema; which allows fast queries on sequences of page visits. Then; the chapter presentsthe so-called “hybrid” technique; which combines DW Web log schemas with a data miningtechnique called Hypertext Probabilistic Grammars; hereby providing fast and flexibleconstraint-based Web log analysis.

Music Warehouses: Challenges for the Next Generation of Music Search,Francois Deliège; Torben B Pedersen,Abstract Music Information Retrieval has received increasing attention from both theindustrial and the research communities in recent years. Many audio extraction techniquesproviding content-based music information have been developed; sparking the need forintelligent storage and retrieval facilities. This paper proposes to satisfy this need byextending technology from business-oriented data warehouses to so-called musicwarehouses that integrate a large variety of music-related information; including both low-level features and high-level musical information. Music warehouses thus help to close the“semantic gap” by supporting integrated querying of these two kinds of music data. Thispaper presents a number of new challenges for the database community that must be takenup to meet the particular demands of music warehouses.,*,2006,*

Advanced Implementation Techniques for Scientific Data Warehouses,Torben Bach Pedersen; Christian S Jensen,Abstract Data warehouses using a multidimensional view of data have become very popularin both business and science in recent years. Data warehouses for scientific purposes suchas medicine and bio-chemistry1 pose several great challenges to existing data warehousetechnology. Data warehouses usually use pre-aggregated data to ensure fast queryresponse. However; pre-aggregation cannot be used in practice if the dimension structuresor the relationships between facts and dimensions are irregular. A technique for overcomingthis limitation and some experimental results are presented. Queries over scientific datawarehouses often need to reference data that is external to the data warehouse; eg; datathat is too complex to be handled by current data warehouse technology; data that is”owned” by other organizations; or data that is updated frequently. An example of this are …,Advanced Implementation Techniques for Scientific Data Warehouses,2000,*

Answering Provenance-Aware Queries on RDF Data Cubes under Memory Budgets,Luis Galárraga; Kim Ahlstrøm; Katja Hose; Torben Bach Pedersen,Abstract. The steadily-growing popularity of semantic data on the Web and the support foraggregation queries in SPARQL 1.1 have propelled the interest in Online AnalyticalProcessing (OLAP) and multidimensional data (cubes) in RDF. Query processing in suchsettings is challenging because SPARQL OLAP queries usually contain many triple patternswith grouping and aggregation. Moreover; one important factor of query answering on Webdata is its provenance; ie; metadata about its origin. Some applications in data analytics andaccess control require to augment the data with provenance metadata and run queries thatimpose constraints on this provenance. This task is called provenance-aware queryanswering. In this paper; we investigate the benefit of caching some parts of an RDF cubeaugmented with provenance information when answering provenanceaware SPARQL …,*,*,*

In this paper we show how to federate object databases andsummary databases. We use the term object database (ODB) to mean a database that usesan object data model which supports the concepts of object classes; attributes; inheritancebetween object classes; and associations between classes. The ODMG data model [2] is anexample of such an object data model. We have chosen an object data model rather than arelational data model because of the rich; yet simple; data model and query language thatincludes constructs such as inheritance and path expressions. It is well known that objectmodels are used for database design and are often implemented on top of relationalsystems.
