Rule Discovery from Time Series.,Gautam Das; King-Ip Lin; Heikki Mannila; Gopal Renganathan; Padhraic Smyth,Abstract We consider the problem of finding rules relating patterns in a time series to otherpatterns in that series; or patterns in one series to patterns in another series. A simpleexample is a rule such as" a period of low telephone call activity is usually followed by asharp rise ill call vohune". Examples of rules relating two or more time series are" if theMicrosoft stock price goes up and lntel falls; then IBM goes up the next. day;" and" ifMicrosoft goes up strongly fro" one day; then declines strongly on the next day; and on thesame days Intel stays about; level; then IBM stays about level." Our emphasis is in thediscovery of local patterns in multivariate time series; in contrast to traditional time seriesanalysis which largely focuses on global models. Thus; we search for rules whoseconditions refer to patterns in time series. However; we do not want to define beforehand …,KDD,1998,859
On sparse spanners of weighted graphs,Ingo Althöfer; Gautam Das; David Dobkin; Deborah Joseph; José Soares,Abstract Given a graph G; a subgraph G'is at-spanner of G if; for every u; v ɛ V; the distancefrom u to v in G'is at most t times longer than the distance in G. In this paper we give a simplealgorithm for constructing sparse spanners for arbitrary weighted graphs. We then apply thisalgorithm to obtain specific results for planar graphs and Euclidean graphs.

Finding similar time series,Gautam Das; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Heikki Mannila,Abstract Similarity of objects is one of the crucial concepts in several applications; includingdata mining. For complex objects; similarity is nontrivial to define. In this paper we presentan intuitive model for measuring the similarity between two time series. The model takes intoaccount outliers; different scaling functions; and variable sampling rates. Using methodsfrom computational geometry; we show that this notion of similarity can be computed inpolynomial time. Using statistical approximation techniques; the algorithms can be speededup considerably. We give preliminary experimental results that show the naturalness of thenotion.,European Symposium on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,1997,412

Group recommendation: Semantics and efficiency,Sihem Amer-Yahia; Senjuti Basu Roy; Ashish Chawlat; Gautam Das; Cong Yu,Abstract We study the problem of group recommendation. Recommendation is an importantinformation exploration paradigm that retrieves interesting items for users based on theirprofiles and past activities. Single user recommendation has received significant attention inthe past due to its extensive use in Amazon and Netflix. How to recommend to a group ofusers who may or may not share similar tastes; however; is still an open problem. The needfor group recommendation arises in many scenarios: a movie for friends to watch together; atravel destination for a family to spend a holiday break; and a good restaurant for colleaguesto have a working lunch. Intuitively; items that are ideal for recommendation to a group maybe quite different from those for individual members. In this paper; we analyze the desiderataof group recommendation and propose a formal semantics that accounts for both item …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,253
Dynamic sample selection for approximate query processing,Brian Babcock; Surajit Chaudhuri; Gautam Das,Abstract In decision support applications; the ability to provide fast approximate answers toaggregation queries is desirable. One commonly-used technique for approximate queryanswering is sampling. For many aggregation queries; appropriately constructed biased(non-uniform) samples can provide more accurate approximations than a uniform sample.The optimal type of bias; however; varies from query to query. In this paper; we describe anapproximate query processing technique that dynamically constructs an appropriatelybiased sample for each query by combining samples selected from a family of non-uniformsamples that are constructed during a pre-processing phase. We show that dynamicselection of appropriate portions of previously constructed samples can provide moreaccurate approximate answers than static; non-adaptive usage of uniform or non-uniform …,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,241
Finding frequent items in probabilistic data,Qin Zhang; Feifei Li; Ke Yi,Abstract Computing statistical information on probabilistic data has attracted a lot of attentionrecently; as the data generated from a wide range of data sources are inherently fuzzy oruncertain. In this paper; we study an important statistical query on probabilistic data: findingthe frequent items. One straightforward approach to identify the frequent items in aprobabilistic data set is to simply compute the expected frequency of an item and decide if itexceeds a certain fraction of the expected size of the whole data set. However; this simpledefinition misses important information about the internal structure of the probabilistic dataand the interplay among all the uncertain entities. Thus; we propose a new definition basedon the possible world semantics that has been widely adopted for many query types inuncertain data management; trying to find all the items that are likely to be frequent in a …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,218
Semantics of ranking queries for probabilistic data and expected ranks,Graham Cormode; Feifei Li; Ke Yi,When dealing with massive quantities of data; top-k queries are a powerful technique forreturning only the k most relevant tuples for inspection; based on a scoring function. Theproblem of efficiently answering such ranking queries has been studied and analyzedextensively within traditional database settings. The importance of the top-k is perhaps evengreater in probabilistic databases; where a relation can encode exponentially many possibleworlds. There have been several recent attempts to propose definitions and algorithms forranking queries over probabilistic data. However; these all lack many of the intuitiveproperties of a top-k over deterministic data. Specifically; we define a number of fundamentalproperties; including exact-k; containment; unique-rank; value-invariance; and stability;which are all satisfied by ranking queries on certain data. We argue that all these …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,212
Euclidean spanners: short; thin; and lanky,Sunil Arya; Gautam Das; David M Mount; Jeffrey S Salowe; Michiel Smid,Abstract Euclidean spanners are important data structures in geometric algorithm design;because they provide a means of approximating the complete Euclidean graph with only O(n) edges; so that the shortest path length between each pair of points is not more than aconstant factor longer than the Euclidean distance between the points. In many applicationsof spanners; it is important that the spanner possess a number of additional properties: lowtot al edge weight; bounded degree; and low diameter. Existing research on spanners hasconsidered one property or the other. We show that it is possible to build spanners in optimalO (n log n) time and O (n) space that achieve optimal or near optimal tradeoffs between allcombinations of these,Proceedings of the twenty-seventh annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,1995,211
New sparseness results on graph spanners,Barun Chandra; Gautam Das; Giri Narasimhan; José Soares,Abstract Let G=(V; E) be an n-vertex connected graph with positive edge weights. Asubgraph G′=(V; E′) is a t-spanner of G if for all u; v &egr; V; the weighted distancebetween u and v in G′ is at most t times the weighted distance between u and v in G. Weconsider the problem of constructing sparse spanners; and the weight; defined as the sum ofthe edge weights in the spanner. In this paper; we concentrate on constructing spanners ofsmall weight. For an arbitrary positive edge-weighted graph G; for any t> 1; and any &egr;>0; we show that a t-spanner of G with weight O (n (2+ &egr;)/(t-1>)• wt (MST) can beconstructed in polynomial time. We also show that (log 2 n)-spanners of weight O (log n)• wt(MST) can be constructed. We then consider spanners for complete graphs induced by a setof points in d-dimensional real normed space.

The discrete basis problem,Pauli Miettinen; Taneli Mielikäinen; Aristides Gionis; Gautam Das; Heikki Mannila,Matrix decomposition methods represent a data matrix as a product of two factor matrices:one containing basis vectors that represent meaningful concepts in the data; and anotherdescribing how the observed data can be expressed as combinations of the basis vectors.Decomposition methods have been studied extensively; but many methods return real-valued matrices. Interpreting real-valued factor matrices is hard if the original data isBoolean. In this paper; we describe a matrix decomposition formulation for Boolean data; theDiscrete Basis Problem. The problem seeks for a Boolean decomposition of a binary matrix;thus allowing the user to easily interpret the basis vectors. We also describe a variation ofthe problem; the Discrete Basis Partitioning Problem. We show that both problems are NP-hard. For the Discrete Basis Problem; we give a simple greedy algorithm for solving it; for …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2008,197

Answering top-k queries using views,Gautam Das; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Nick Koudas; Dimitris Tsirogiannis,Abstract The problem of obtaining efficient answers to top-k queries has attracted a lot ofresearch attention. Several algorithms and numerous variants of the top-k retrieval problemhave been introduced in recent years. The general form of this problem requests the khighest ranked values from a relation; using monotone combining functions on (a subset of)its attributes. In this paper we explore space performance tradeoffs related to this problem. Inparticular we study the problem of answering top-k queries using views. A view in thiscontext is a materialized version of a previously posed query; requesting a number ofhighest ranked values according to some monotone combining function defined on a subsetof the attributes of a relation. Several problems of interest arise in the presence of suchviews. We start by presenting a new algorithm capable of combining the information from …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,190
Overcoming limitations of sampling for aggregation queries,Surajit Chaudhuri; Gautam Das; Mayur Datar; Rajeev Motwani; Vivek Narasayya,Studies the problem of approximately answering aggregation queries using sampling. Weobserve that uniform sampling performs poorly when the distribution of the aggregatedattribute is skewed. To address this issue; we introduce a technique called outlier indexing.Uniform sampling is also ineffective for queries with low selectivity. We rely on weightedsampling based on workload information to overcome this shortcoming. We demonstratethat a combination of outlier indexing with weighted sampling can be used to answeraggregation queries with a significantly reduced approximation error compared to eitheruniform sampling or weighted sampling alone. We discuss the implementation of thesetechniques on Microsoft's SQL Server and present experimental results that demonstrate themerits of our techniques.,Data Engineering; 2001.

Which triangulations approximate the complete graph?,Gautam Das; Deborah Joseph,Abstract Chew and Dobkin et. al. have shown that the Delaunay triangulation and itsvariants are sparse approximations of the complete graph; in that the shortest distancebetween two sites within the triangulation is bounded by a constant multiple of theirEuclidean separation. In this paper; we show that other classical triangulation algorithms;such as the greedy triangulation; and more notably; the minimum weight triangulation; alsoapproximate the complete graph in this sense. We also design an algorithm for constructingextremely sparse (nontriangular) planar graphs that approximate the complete graph. Wedefine a sufficiency condition and show that any Euclidean planar graph constructingalgorithm which satisfies this condition always produces good approximations of thecomplete graph. This condition is quite general because it is satisfied by all the …,*,1989,138

In the last decade;there has been an explosion of interest in Mining time series data. A nunber of newalgorithms have been introduced to classify; cluster; segment; index; discover rules; anddetect anomalies/novelties in time series. While these many different techniques used tosolve these problems use a multitude of different techniques; they all have one commonfactor; they require some high level representation of the data; rather than the original rawdata. These high level representation are necessary as a feature extraction step; or simply tomake the storage; transmission; and computation of massive dataset feasible. A multitute ofrepresentations have been proposed in the literature; including spectral transform; waveletstransforms; piecewise polynomials; eigenfunctions; and symbolic mappings.

A fast algorithm for constructing sparse Euclidean spanners,Gautam Das; Giri Narasimhan,Let G=(V; E) be a n-vertex connected graph with positive edge weights; and let t> 1 be a realconstant. A subgraph G'is a t-spanner if for all u; v∊ V; the weight of the shortest pathbetween u and v in G'is at most t times the weight of the corresponding shortest path in G.We design an O (n log 2 n) time algorithm which; given a set V of n points in k-dimensionalspace (for any fixed k); and any real constant t> 1; produces a t-spanner of the completeEuclidean graph of V. This algorithm retains the spirit of a recent O (n3 log n) time greedyalgorithm which produces t-spanners; we use graph clustering techniques to achieve a moreefficient implementation. Our spanners have O (n) edges and weight O (1)· wt (MST); whichis similar to the size and weight of spanners constructed by the greedy algorithm. Theconstants implicit in the O-notation depend upon t and k.,International Journal of Computational Geometry & Applications,1997,127
Planar spanners and approximate shortest path queries among obstacles in the plane,Srinivasa Arikati; Danny Z Chen; L Paul Chew; Gautam Das; Michiel Smid; Christos D Zaroliagis,Abstract We consider the problem of finding an obstacle-avoiding path between two points sand t in the plane; amidst a set of disjoint polygonal obstacles with a total of n vertices. Thelength of this path should be within a small constant factor c of the length of the shortestpossible obstacle-avoiding st path measured in the L p-metric. Such an approximateshortest path is called a c-short path; or a short path with stretch factor c. The goal is topreprocess the obstacle-scattered plane by creating an efficient data structure that enablesfast reporting of ac-short path (or its length). In this paper; we give a family of algorithms forthe above problem that achieve an interesting trade-off between the stretch factor; the querytime and the preprocessing bounds. Our main results are algorithms that achieve logarithmiclength query time; after subquadratic time and space preprocessing.,European Symposium on Algorithms,1996,114

Effective use of block-level sampling in statistics estimation,Surajit Chaudhuri; Gautam Das; Utkarsh Srivastava,Abstract Block-level sampling is far more efficient than true uniform-random sampling over alarge database; but prone to significant errors if used to create database statistics. In thispaper; we develop principled approaches to overcome this limitation of block-level samplingfor histograms as well as distinct-value estimations. For histogram construction; we give anovel two-phase adaptive method in which the sample size required to reach a desiredaccuracy is decided based on a first phase sample. This method is significantly faster thanprevious iterative methods proposed for the same problem. For distinct-value estimation; weshow that existing estimators designed for uniform-random samples may perform very poorlyif used directly on block-level samples.

Minimum-effort driven dynamic faceted search in structured databases,Senjuti Basu Roy; Haidong Wang; Gautam Das; Ullas Nambiar; Mukesh Mohania,Abstract In this paper; we propose minimum-effort driven navigational techniques forenterprise database systems based on the faceted search paradigm. Our proposedtechniques dynamically suggest facets for drilling down into the database such that the costof navigation is minimized. At every step; the system asks the user a question or a set ofquestions on different facets and depending on the user response; dynamically fetches thenext most promising set of facets; and the process repeats. Facets are selected based ontheir ability to rapidly drill down to the most promising tuples; as well as on the ability of theuser to provide desired values for them. Our facet selection algorithms also work inconjunction with any ranked retrieval model where a ranking function imposes a bias overthe user preferences for the selected tuples.

Similarity of Attributes by External Probes.,Gautam Das; Heikki Mannila; Pirjo Ronkainen,Abstract In data mining; similarity or distance between attributes is one of the central notions.Such a notion can be used to build attribute hierarchies etc. Similarity metrics can be user-defined; but an important problem is defining similarity on the basis of data. Several methodsbased on statistical techniques exist. For defining the similarity between two attributes A andB they typically consider only the values of A and B; not the other attributes. We describehow a similarity notion between attributes can be defined by considering the values of otherattributes. The basic idea is that in a 0/1 relation r; two attributes A and B are similar if thesubrelations aA= l (r) and aB=~(r) are similar. Similarity between the two relations is definedby considering the marginal frequencies of a selected subset of other attributes. We showthat the framework produces natural notions of similarity.

Rotation invariant distance measures for trajectories,Michail Vlachos; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Gautam Das,Abstract For the discovery of similar patterns in 1D time-series; it is very typical to perform anormalization of the data (for example a transformation so that the data follow a zero meanand unit standard deviation). Such transformations can reveal latent patterns and are verycommonly used in datamining applications. However; when dealing with multidimensionaltime-series; which appear naturally in applications such as video-tracking; motion-captureetc; similar motion patterns can also be expressed at different orientations. It is thereforeimperative to provide support for additional transformations; such as rotation. In this work; wetransform the positional information of moving data; into a space that is translation; scale androtation invariant. Our distance measure in the new space is able to detect elastic matchesand can be efficiently lower bounded; thus being computationally tractable.

Ad-hoc top-k query answering for data streams,Gautam Das; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Nick Koudas; Nikos Sarkas,Abstract A top-k query retrieves the k highest scoring tuples from a data set with respect to ascoring function defined on the attributes of a tuple. The efficient evaluation of top-k querieshas been an active research topic and many different instantiations of the problem; in avariety of settings; have been studied. However; techniques developed for conventional;centralized or distributed databases are not directly applicable to highly dynamicenvironments and on-line applications; like data streams. Recently; techniques supportingtop-k queries on data streams have been introduced. Such techniques are restrictivehowever; as they can only efficiently report top-k answers with respect to a pre-specified (asopposed to ad-hoc) set of queries. In this paper we introduce a novel geometricrepresentation for the top-k query problem that allows us to raise this restriction.

A random walk approach to sampling hidden databases,Arjun Dasgupta; Gautam Das; Heikki Mannila,Abstract A large part of the data on the World Wide Web is hidden behind form-likeinterfaces. These interfaces interact with a hidden back-end database to provide answers touser queries. Generating a uniform random sample of this hidden database by using onlythe publicly available interface gives us access to the underlying data distribution. In thispaper; we propose a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface tosample such databases. We discuss variants where the query space is visualized as a fixedand random ordering of attributes. We also propose techniques to further improve thesample quality by using a probabilistic rejection based approach. We conduct extensiveexperiments to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of our techniques.,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,91

When networks ofservers are used to provide scalable content-based publish/subscribe services; we have theflexibility of partitioning existing subscriptions and routing new subscriptions among multipleservers to optimize various performance metrics including total network traffic; loadbalancing; and system throughput. We propose two approaches to subscription partitioningand routing; one based on partitioning the event space and the other based on partitioningthe subscription set; and discuss their trade-offs.

A New Way to Weigh Malnourished Euclidean Graphs.,Gautam Das; Giri Narasimhan; Jeffrey S Salowe,Abstract In this paper; we show that any Euclidean graph over a set V of n points in fc-dimensional space that satisfies either the leapfrog property or the isolation property hassmall weight; ie; has weight O (l)• wt (SMT); where SMT is a Steiner minimal tree of V. Boththe leapfrog property as well as the isolation property constrain the way the edges of thegraph are configured in space. Our main application is to prove that certain Euclideangraphs known as t-spanners can be constructed with optimal weight of O (l)• wt (SMT); anintriguing open problem that has attracted much attention recently. The main tool inobtaining the above weight bounds is a theorem that proves the existence of long edges in aSteiner minimal tree on a restricted set of points in fc-dimensional space. We also generalizethis theorem for Steiner minimal trees on arbitrary point sets. Since very little is known …,SODA,1995,89

Standing out in a crowd: Selecting attributes for maximum visibility,Muhammed Miah; Gautam Das; Vagelis Hristidis; Heikki Mannila,In recent years; there has been significant interest in development of ranking functions andefficient top-k retrieval algorithms to help users in ad-hoc search and retrieval in databases(eg; buyers searching for products in a catalog). In this paper we focus on a novel andcomplementary problem: how to guide a seller in selecting the best attributes of a new tuple(eg; new product) to highlight such that it stands out in the crowd of existing competitiveproducts and is widely visible to the pool of potential buyers.

Ordering the attributes of query results,Gautam Das; Vagelis Hristidis; Nishant Kapoor; Shashank Sudarshan,Abstract There has been a great deal of interest in the past few years on ranking of results ofqueries on structured databases; including work on probabilistic information retrieval; rankaggregation; and algorithms for merging of ordered lists. In many applications; for examplesales of homes; used cars or electronic goods; data items have a very large number ofattributes. When displaying a (ranked) list of items to users; only a few attributes can beshown. Traditionally; these are selected manually. We argue that automatic selection ofattributes is required to deal with different requirements of different users. We formulate theproblem as an optimization problem of choosing the most" useful" set of attributes; that is; theattributes that are most influential in the ranking of the items. We discuss different variants ofour notion of attribute usefulness; and propose a hybrid Split-Pane approach that returns …,Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2006,79
Time series similarity measures and time series indexing,Dimitrios Gunopulos; Gautam Das,Abstract Time series is the simplest form of temporal data. A time series is a sequence of realnumbers collected regularly in time; where each number represents a value. Time seriesdata come up in a variety of domains; including stock market analysis; environmental data;telecommunications data; medical data and financial data. Web data that count the numberof clicks on given cites; or model the usage of different pages are also modeled as timeseries. Therefore time series account for a large fraction of the data stored in commercialdatabases. There is recently increasing recognition of this fact; and support for time series asa different data type in commercial data bases management systems is increasing. IBM DB2for example implements support for time series using data-blades. The pervasiveness andimportance of time series data has sparked a lot of research work on the topic.

Context-based similarity measures for categorical databases,Gautam Das; Heikki Mannila,Abstract Similarity between complex data objects is one of the central notions in data mining.We propose certain similarity (or distance) measures between various components of a 0/1relation. We define measures between attributes; between rows; and between subrelationsof the database. They find important applications in clustering; classification; and severalother data mining processes. Our measures are based on the contexts of individualcomponents. For example; two products (ie; attributes) are deemed similar if their respectivesets of customers (ie; subrelations) are similar. This reveals more subtle relationshipsbetween components; something that is usually missing in simpler measures. Our problemof finding distance measures can be formulated as a system of nonlinear equations.

Summary-based routing for content-based event distribution networks,Yi-Min Wang; Lili Qiu; Chad Verbowski; Dimitris Achlioptas; Gautam Das; Paul Larson,Abstract Providing scalable distributed Web-based eventing services has been an importantresearch topic. It is desirable to have an effective mechanism for the servers to summarizetheir filters for in-network preprocessing in order to optimize system performance. In thispaper; we propose a summary-based routing mechanism and introduce the notion ofimprecise summaries to provide a trade-off between routing overhead and event traffic. Oursystem uses similarity-based filter clustering to reduce overall event traffic and performs self-tuning summary precision selection to optimize throughput. We have implemented summary-based routing on top of an XML-based infrastructure that closely follows the proposed Webservices standards. Measurements from the actual implementation validate our analyticaland simulation results; and demonstrate the practical benefits of the proposed techniques.,ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2004,71
Simulation of real and reactive power flow control with UPFC connected to a transmission line.,S Tara Kalyani; G Tulasiram Das,Abstract The Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) is the most versatile and complex powerelectronic equipment that has emerged for the control and optimization of power flow inelectrical power transmission system. This paper presents real and reactive power flowcontrol through a transmission line by placing UPFC at the sending end using computersimulation. When no UPFC is installed; real and reactive power through the transmissionline can not be controlled. This paper presents control and performance of UPFC intendedfor installation on that transmission line to control power flow. A control system whichenables the UPFC to follow the changes in reference values like AC voltage; DC voltageand angle order of the series voltage source converter is simulated.

Unbiased estimation of size and other aggregates over hidden web databases,Arjun Dasgupta; Xin Jin; Bradley Jewell; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,Abstract Many websites provide restrictive form-like interfaces which allow users to executesearch queries on the underlying hidden databases. In this paper; we consider the problemof estimating the size of a hidden database through its web interface. We propose noveltechniques which use a small number of queries to produce unbiased estimates with smallvariance. These techniques can also be used for approximate query processing over hiddendatabases. We present theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to illustrate theeffectiveness of our approach.,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,67

In this paper; we focus on improving the performance ofinformation collection from the neighborhood of a user in a dynamic social network. Weintroduce sampling-based algorithms to efficiently explore a user's social network respectingits structure and to quickly approximate quantities of interest. We introduce and analyzevariants of the basic sampling scheme exploring correlations across our samples. Models ofcentralized and distributed social networks are considered. We show that our algorithms canbe utilized to rank items in the neighborhood of a user; assuming that information for eachuser in the network is available.

Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase and its critical role in protein biosynthesis,Gautam Das; Umesh Varshney,Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (Pth) releases tRNA from peptidyl-tRNA by cleaving the ester bondbetween the peptide and the tRNA. Genetic analyses using Escherichia coli harbouringtemperature-sensitive Pth have identified a number of translation factors involved in peptidyl-tRNA release. Accumulation of peptidyl-tRNA in the cells leads to depletion of aminoacyl-tRNA pools and halts protein biosynthesis. Thus; it is vital for cells to maintain Pth activity todeal with the pollution of peptidyl-tRNAs generated during the initiation; elongation andtermination steps of protein biosynthesis. Interestingly; while eubacteria possess a singleclass of peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase; eukaryotes possess several such activities; making Pth apotential drug target to control eubacterial infections. This review discusses the aspects ofPth that relate to its history and biochemistry and its physiological connections with …,Microbiology,2006,62
Interactive itinerary planning,Senjuti Basu Roy; Gautam Das; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Cong Yu,Planning an itinerary when traveling to a city involves substantial effort in choosing Points-of-Interest (POIs); deciding in which order to visit them; and accounting for the time it takes tovisit each POI and transit between them. Several online services address different aspects ofitinerary planning but none of them provides an interactive interface where users givefeedbacks and iteratively construct their itineraries based on personal interests and timebudget. In this paper; we formalize interactive itinerary planning as an iterative processwhere; at each step:(1) the user provides feedback on POIs selected by the system;(2) thesystem recommends the best itineraries based on all feedback so far; and (3) the systemfurther selects a new set of POIs; with optimal utility; to solicit feedback for; at the next step.This iterative process stops when the user is satisfied with the recommended itinerary.

A single mammalian mitochondrial translation initiation factor functionally replaces two bacterial factors,Rahul Gaur; Domenick Grasso; Partha P Datta; PDV Krishna; Gautam Das; Angela Spencer; Rajendra K Agrawal; Linda Spremulli; Umesh Varshney,Summary The mechanism of translation in eubacteria and organelles is thought to besimilar. In eubacteria; the three initiation factors IF1; IF2; and IF3 are vital. Although thehomologs of IF2 and IF3 are found in mammalian mitochondria; an IF1 homolog has neverbeen detected. Here; we show that bovine mitochondrial IF2 (IF2 mt) complements E. colicontaining a deletion of the IF2 gene (E. coli ΔinfB). We find that IF1 is no longer essential inan IF2 mt-supported E. coli ΔinfB strain. Furthermore; biochemical and molecular modelingdata show that a conserved insertion of 37 amino acids in the IF2 mt substitutes for thefunction of IF1. Deletion of this insertion from IF2 mt supports E. coli for the essential functionof IF2. However; in this background; IF1 remains essential. These observations providestrong evidence that a single factor (IF2 mt) in mammalian mitochondria performs the …,Molecular cell,2008,58
Anytime measures for top-k algorithms,Benjamin Arai; Gautam Das; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Nick Koudas,Abstract Top-k queries on large multi-attribute data sets are fundamental operations ininformation retrieval and ranking applications. In this paper; we initiate research on theanytime behavior of top-k algorithms. In particular; given specific top-k algorithms (TA andTA-Sorted) we are interested in studying their progress toward identification of the correctresult at any point during the algorithms' execution. We adopt a probabilistic approachwhere we seek to report at any point of operation of the algorithm the confidence that the top-k result has been identified. Such a functionality can be a valuable asset when one isinterested in reducing the runtime cost of top-k computations. We present a thoroughexperimental evaluation to validate our techniques using both synthetic and real data sets.,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,57

Categorical skylines for streaming data,Nikos Sarkas; Gautam Das; Nick Koudas; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract The problem of skyline computation has attracted considerable research attention.In the categorical domain the problem becomes more complicated; primarily due to thepartially-ordered nature of the attributes of tuples. In this paper; we initiate a study ofstreaming categorical skylines. We identify the limitations of existing work for offlinecategorical skyline computation and realize novel techniques for the problem of maintainingthe skyline of categorical data in a streaming environment. In particular; we develop alightweight data structure for indexing the tuples in the streaming buffer; that can gracefullyadapt to tuples with many attributes and partially ordered domains of any size andcomplexity. Additionally; our study of the dominance relation in the dual space allows us toutilize geometric arrangements in order to index the categorical skyline and efficiently …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,56
Role of 16S ribosomal RNA methylations in translation initiation in Escherichia coli,Gautam Das; Dinesh Kumar Thotala; Suman Kapoor; Sheelarani Karunanithi; Suman S Thakur; N Sadananda Singh; Umesh Varshney,Translation initiation from the ribosomal P‐site is the specialty of the initiator tRNAs (tRNAfMet). Presence of the three consecutive G‐C base pairs (G29‐C41; G30‐C40 and G31‐C39) in their anticodon stems; a highly conserved feature of the initiator tRNAs across thethree kingdoms of life; has been implicated in their preferential binding to the P‐site. Howthis feature is exploited by ribosomes has remained unclear. Using a genetic screen; wehave isolated an Escherichia coli strain; carrying a G122D mutation in folD; which allowsinitiation with the tRNA fMet containing mutations in one; two or all the three G‐C base pairs.The strain shows a severe deficiency of methionine and S‐adenosylmethionine; and lacksnucleoside methylations in rRNA. Targeted mutations in the methyltransferase genes haverevealed a connection between the rRNA modifications and the fundamental process of …,The EMBO journal,2008,53
System for keyword based searching over relational databases,*,Searching by keywords on a relational database is enabled by performing preprocessingoperations to construct lookup tables at an interim level of granularity; such as columnlocation. A keyword search is performed on the lookup tables rather than the databasetables to determine database column locations of the keyword. Schema information aboutthe database is used to link the column locations to form database subgraphs that span thekeywords. Join tables are to generated based on the subgraphs consisting of columnscontaining the keywords. A query on the database is generated to join the tables andretrieve database rows that contain the keywords. The retrieved rows are ranked in order ofrelevance before being output. By preprocessing a relational database to form lookuptables; and initially searching the lookup tables to obtain a targeted subset of the …,*,2004,52
Leveraging count information in sampling hidden databases,Arjun Dasgupta; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,A large number of online databases are hidden behind form-like interfaces which allowusers to execute search queries by specifying selection conditions in the interface. Most ofthese interfaces return restricted answers (eg; only top-k of the selected tuples); while manyof them also accompany each answer with the COUNT of the selected tuples. In this paper;we propose techniques which leverage the COUNT information to ef¿ ciently acquireunbiased samples of the hidden database. We also discuss variants for interfaces which donot provide COUNTinformation. We conduct extensive experiments to illustrate the ef¿ciency and accuracy of our techniques.,Data Engineering; 2009.

Constructing and exploring composite items,Senjuti Basu Roy; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Ashish Chawla; Gautam Das; Cong Yu,Abstract Nowadays; online shopping has become a daily activity. Web users purchase avariety of items ranging from books to electronics. The large supply of online products callsfor sophisticated techniques to help users explore available items. We propose to buildcomposite items which associate a central item with a set of packages; formed by satelliteitems; and help users explore them. For example; a user shopping for an iPhone (ie; thecentral item) with a price budget can be presented with both the iPhone and a package ofother items that match well with the iPhone (eg;{Belkin case; Bose sounddock; Kroo USBcable}) as a composite item; whose total price is within the user's budget.

While computing individualrecommendations have received lots of attention (eg; Netflix prize); group recommendationhas been confined to studying users' satisfaction with different aggregation strategies. In thispaper (Some results are published in an earlier conference paper (Amer-Yahia et al. inVLDB; 2009). See Sect."

Small group sampling of data for use in query processing,*,In decision support applications; the ability to provide fast approximate answers toaggregation queries is desirable. A disclosed technique for approximate query answering issampling. For many aggregation queries; appropriately constructed biased (non-uniform)samples can provide more accurate approximations than a uniform sample. The optimaltype of bias; however; varies from query to query. An approximate query processingtechnique is used that dynamically constructs an appropriately biased sample for eachquery by combining samples selected from a family of non-uniform samples that areconstructed during a pre-processing phase. Dynamic selection of appropriate portions ofpreviously constructed samples can more accurate approximate answers than static; non-adaptive usage of uniform or non-uniform samples.,*,2004,45

Measure-driven keyword-query expansion,Nikos Sarkas; Nilesh Bansal; Gautam Das; Nick Koudas,Abstract User generated content has been fueling an explosion in the amount of availabletextual data. In this context; it is also common for users to express; either explicitly (throughnumerical ratings) or implicitly; their views and opinions on products; events; etc. This wealthof textual information necessitates the development of novel searching and data explorationparadigms. In this paper we propose a new searching model; similar in spirit to facetedsearch; that enables the progressive refinement of a keyword-query result. However; incontrast to faceted search which utilizes domain-specific and hard-to-extract documentattributes; the refinement process is driven by suggesting interesting expansions of theoriginal query with additional search terms.

The move-split-merge metric for time series,Alexandra Stefan; Vassilis Athitsos; Gautam Das,A novel metric for time series; called Move-Split-Merge (MSM); is proposed. This metric usesas building blocks three fundamental operations: Move; Split; and Merge; which can beapplied in sequence to transform any time series into any other time series. A Moveoperation changes the value of a single element; a Split operation converts a single elementinto two consecutive elements; and a Merge operation merges two consecutive elementsinto one. Each operation has an associated cost; and the MSM distance between two timeseries is defined to be the cost of the cheapest sequence of operations that transforms thefirst time series into the second one. An efficient; quadratic-time algorithm is provided forcomputing the MSM distance.

Evidence for a role of initiation factor 3 in recycling of ribosomal complexes stalled on mRNAs in Escherichia coli,NS Singh; G Das; A Seshadri; R Sangeetha; U Varshney,Abstract Specific interactions between ribosome recycling factor (RRF) and elongation factor-G (EFG) mediate disassembly of post-termination ribosomal complexes for new rounds ofinitiation. The interactions between RRF and EFG are also important in peptidyl-tRNArelease from stalled pre-termination complexes. Unlike the post-termination complexes(harboring deacylated tRNA); the pre-termination complexes (harboring peptidyl-tRNA) arenot recycled by RRF and EFG in vitro; suggesting participation of additional factor (s) in theprocess.

Mri: Meaningful interpretations of collaborative ratings,Mahashweta Das; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Gautam Das; Cong Yu,ABSTRACT Collaborative rating sites have become essential resources that many usersconsult to make purchasing decisions on various items. Ideally; a user wants to quicklydecide whether an item is desirable; especially when many choices are available. Inpractice; however; a user either spends a lot of time examining reviews before making aninformed decision; or simply trusts overall rating aggregations associated with an item. Inthis paper; we argue that neither option is satisfactory and propose a novel and powerfulthird option; Meaningful Ratings Interpretation (MRI); that automatically provides ameaningful interpretation of ratings associated with the input items. As a simple example;given the movie “Usual Suspects;” instead of simply showing the average rating of 8.7 fromall reviewers; MRI produces a set of meaningful factoids such as “male reviewers under …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,35

Jarosites: a review,GK Das; S Acharya; S Anand; RP Das,Abstract Jarosites are known to be potential compounds for the Fe (III); SO4 2− andimpurities control in hydrometallurgical processes. Due to inherent association of Na; K; Fe;Al with the oxidic and sulphidic ores; these metal ions dissolve during sulphuric acidleaching and subsequently reprecipitate as varieties of ferric hydroxysulphates. Theformation of jarosites is favoured in the temperature range of 80-100° C and pH< 2.5.

On skyline groups,Nan Zhang; Chengkai Li; Naeemul Hassan; Sundaresan Rajasekaran; Gautam Das,We formulate and investigate the novel problem of finding the skyline k-tuple groups from ann-tuple data set-ie; groups of k tuples which are not dominated by any other group of equalsize; based on aggregate-based group dominance relationship. The major technicalchallenge is to identify effective anti-monotonic properties for pruning the search space ofskyline groups. To this end; we first show that the anti-monotonic property in the well-knownApriori algorithm does not hold for skyline group pruning. Then; we identify two anti-monotonic properties with varying degrees of applicability: order-specific property whichapplies to SUM; MIN; and MAX as well as weak candidate-generation property whichapplies to MIN and MAX only. Experimental results on both real and synthetic data setsverify that the proposed algorithms achieve orders of magnitude performance gain over …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,27
Just-in-time analytics on large file systems,H Howie Huang; Nan Zhang; Wei Wang; Gautam Das; Alexander S Szalay,As file systems reach the petabytes scale; users and administrators are increasinglyinterested in acquiring high-level analytical information for file management and analysis.Two particularly important tasks are the processing of aggregate and top-k queries which;unfortunately; cannot be quickly answered by hierarchical file systems such as ext3 andNTFS. Existing preprocessing-based solutions; eg; file system crawling and index building;consume a significant amount of time and space (for generating and maintaining theindexes) which in many cases cannot be justified by the infrequent usage of such solutions.In this paper; we advocate that user interests can often be sufficiently satisfied byapproximate-ie; statistically accurate-answers. We develop Glance; a just-in-time sampling-based system which; after consuming a small number of disk accesses; is capable of …,IEEE Transactions on Computers,2012,27
Gastrointestinal bleeding due to worm infestation; with negative upper gastrointestinal endoscopy findings: impact of enteroscopy,BC Sharma; DK Bhasin; HS Bhatti; G Das; K Singh,Results: Five patients (four men; one woman; average age 50 yr; range 40-60) had worminfestation (two hookworm; three roundworm). All the patients had gastrointestinal bleeding(five had melena; one hematemesis; and two hematochezia) for a duration of 7-14 days.Hemoglobin ranged from 2.8 to 9 g/dl. Push enteroscopy revealed fresh blood in thejejunum; multiple erosions; and hookworms in two patients and roundworms in threepatients. Hookworms were retrieved endoscopically in two patients whereas roundwormscould be retrieved in only one patient. All the patients were treated with mebendazole (100mg twice a day for 3 days); iron; and folic acid. Gastrointestinal bleeding subsided in all thepatients. Conclusions: In developing countries; worm infestation should be considered animportant cause of obscure acute gastrointestinal bleeding. Evaluation of the jejunum …,Endoscopy,2000,27
Mining a search engine's corpus: efficient yet unbiased sampling and aggregate estimation,Mingyang Zhang; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,Abstract Search engines over document corpora typically provide keyword-searchinterfaces. Examples include search engines over the web as well as those over enterpriseand government websites. The corpus of such a search engine forms a rich source ofinformation of analytical interest to third parties; but the only available access is by issuingsearch queries through its interface. To support data analytics over a search engine'scorpus; one needs to address two main problems; the sampling of documents (for offlineanalytics) and the direct (online) estimation of aggregates; while issuing a small number ofqueries through the keyword-search interface. Existing work on sampling produces sampleswith unknown bias and may incur an extremely high query cost. Existing aggregateestimation technique suffers from a similar problem; as the estimation error and query …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,26
Algorithm-safe privacy-preserving data publishing,Xin Jin; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,Abstract This paper develops toolsets for eliminating algorithm-based disclosure fromexisting privacy-preserving data publishing algorithms. We first show that the space ofalgorithm-based disclosure is larger than previously believed and thus more prevalent anddangerous. Then; we formally define Algorithm-Safe Publishing (ASP) to model the threatsfrom algorithm-based disclosure. To eliminate algorithm-based disclosure from existing datapublishing algorithms; we propose two generic tools for revising their design: worst-caseeligibility test and stratified pick-up. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our tools by usingthem to transform two popular existing l-diversity algorithms; Mondrian and Hilb; to SP-Mondrian and SP-Hilb which are algorithm-safe. We conduct extensive experiments todemonstrate the effectiveness of SP-Mondrian and SP-Hilb in terms of data utility and …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,26
Turbo-charging hidden database samplers with overflowing queries and skew reduction,Arjun Dasgupta; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,Abstract Recently; there has been growing interest in random sampling from online hiddendatabases. These databases reside behind form-like web interfaces which allow users toexecute search queries by specifying the desired values for certain attributes; and thesystem responds by returning a few (eg; top-k) tuples that satisfy the selection conditions;sorted by a suitable scoring function. In this paper; we consider the problem of uniformrandom sampling over such hidden databases. A key challenge is to eliminate the skew ofsamples incurred by the selective return of highly ranked tuples. To address this challenge;all state-of-the-art samplers share a common approach: they do not use overflowing queries.This is done in order to avoid favoring highly ranked tuples and thus incurring high skew inthe retrieved samples. However; not considering overflowing queries substantially …,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2010,26
Organizational culture and its impact on commitment to work,P Singh; GS Das,This study examines the impact of organizational climate on the level of commitment to workbased on data collected from 200 male respondents from three organizations with similarproduction processes and products. The study leads the authors to believe thatorganizational culture does influence the level of commitment to work significantly. They alsofeel that better organizational culture—where one's higher order needs are satisfied throughautonomy; achievement; self-actualization—leads to higher level of commitment; andconversely the organizational culture with coercive authority system affects the level ofcommitment negatively. They believe that the level of commitment can be raisedconsiderably by designing a better organizational culture.,Indian Journal of Industrial Relations,1978,26

Keyword querying and ranking in databases,Surajit Chaudhuri; Gautam Das,Abstract With the proliferation of data sources exposed through web interfaces toconsumers; simple ways of exploring contents of such databases are of increasingimportance. Examples include users wishing to search catalogs of homes; cars; cameras;restaurants; and photographs. One approach that has been explored is to allow users toquery such databases in the same ways as they explore web documents. Thus; it isdesirable to be able to use the paradigm of keyword querying and automated result rankingover contents of databases. However; the rich relationships and schema information presentin databases makes a direct adaptation of information retrieval techniques inappropriate.This problem has attracted much attention in research as it presents a rich set of challengesfrom defining semantics of such querying model to developing algorithms that ensure …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,25
Characterisation and acid pressure leaching of various nickel-bearing chromite overburden samples,GK Das; S Anand; S Acharya; RP Das,Abstract In an earlier study it was found that additives were required for improving nickelrecoveries from preconcentrated nickel-containing chromite overburden. With a view toconfirming the response; five chromite overburden samples were taken for characterisationand acid pressure leaching studies. Kansa ore was used for comparison because it does notrequire any additives to achieve 98% dissolution of Ni. The X-ray diffraction and TG-DTAstudies revealed that the geothite phase associated with laterite ore is amorphous in naturewhereas the chromite overburden samples had higher fractions of crystalline goethite. In theabsence of additives; nickel associated with the amorphous goethite was leached. Noquantitative relationship could be established between the crystallinity and percentage ofnickel extraction from various samples; although it was possible to get good recoveries by …,Hydrometallurgy,1997,25

Integrated computation; communication and control: towards next revolution in information technology,Feng Xia; Zhi Wang; Youxian Sun,Abstract There is a strong trend in modern industrial systems to integrate computation;communication; and control theories into networked control systems (NCSs). This isanticipated to be the next wave in the information technology revolution. From a controlperspective; the interdisciplinary relationship between computation; communication andcontrol is illustrated through control loop timing analysis of NCSs. Critical issues in theemerging field of integrated computation; communication and control (ICCC) are discussed.Since it is difficult to analytically quantify the impacts of computation and communicationconstraints on the quality of control (QoC); a simulation-based approach is proposed. Anumerical example of networked DC motor control is utilized in simulations; with differentscheduling schemes and communication protocols employed. Results and analysis give …,*,2004,24
Immunization of cross-bred cattle against Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum by purified antigens,G Das; S Ghosh; MH Khan; JK Sharma,Abstract Extracts prepared from unfed larvae of Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum werepurified by immunoaffinity chromatography using anti-gut IgG as ligand. Affinity purifiedantigen (Aff-GHLAg) was used to immunize cross-bred (Bos taurus× B. indicus) calves of 6–7 months of age. Immunized calves rejected 70.6% larvae; 54.5% nymphs and 61.9%adults. No significant changes in the engorged weight of females was observed; however;significant decrease in the engorgement weight of larvae and nymphs was recorded. Therewas a significant decrease in the emerging nymphs (p< 0.05) and adults (p< 0.01) of the tickstages fed on immunized animals.

Approximation schemes in computational geometry,Gautam Das,Abstract The complexity of geometric algorithms depend largely upon the complexity of thegeometric objects they manipulate. In this thesis we consider Euclidean graphs andpolyhedra; which have applications in robotics; motion planning; and circuit design. Wefocus on constructing simpler approximations of these objects. Thus problems involvingthese objects become more tractable; though perhaps at the expense of suboptimality ofsolutions. Some of our approximation schemes are successful; and lead to efficient solutionsto many problems. In others; we prove that the schemes are themselves too complex to bepractically feasible. Our results highlight many combinatorial and geometric properties of theobjects considered. Our results can be divided into two broad categories. First we considerthe problem of approximating dense Euclidean graphs by sparse subgraphs; where the …,*,1990,23
Faster random walks by rewiring online social networks on-the-fly,Zhuojie Zhou; Nan Zhang; Zhiguo Gong; Gautam Das,Abstract Many online social networks feature restrictive web interfaces that only allow thequery of a user's local neighborhood. To enable analytics over such an online socialnetwork through its web interface; many recent efforts use Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) methods such as random walks to sample users in the social network and therebysupport analytics based on the samples. The problem with such an approach; however; isthe large amount of queries often required for a random walk to converge to a desired(stationary) sampling distribution. In this article; we consider a novel problem of enabling afaster random walk over online social networks by “rewiring” the social network on-the-fly.Specifically; we develop a Modified TOpology Sampling (MTO-Sampling) scheme that; byusing only information exposed by the restrictive web interface; constructs a “virtual” …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2016,22
Anytime measures for top-k algorithms on exact and fuzzy data sets,Benjamin Arai; Gautam Das; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Nick Koudas,Abstract Top-k queries on large multi-attribute data sets are fundamental operations ininformation retrieval and ranking applications. In this article; we initiate research on theanytime behavior of top-k algorithms on exact and fuzzy data. In particular; given specific top-k algorithms (TA and TA-Sorted) we are interested in studying their progress towardidentification of the correct result at any point during the algorithms' execution. We adopt aprobabilistic approach where we seek to report at any point of operation of the algorithm theconfidence that the top-k result has been identified. Such a functionality can be a valuableasset when one is interested in reducing the runtime cost of top-k computations. We presenta thorough experimental evaluation to validate our techniques using both synthetic and realdata sets.,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2009,22
Efficient sampling of information in social networks,Gautam Das; Nick Koudas; Manos Papagelis; Sushruth Puttaswamy,Abstract As online social networking emerges; there has been increased interest to utilizethe underlying social structure as well as the available social information to improve search.In this paper; we focus on improving the performance of information collection from theneighborhood of a user in a dynamic social network. To this end; we introduce samplingbased algorithms to quickly approximate quantities of interest from the vicinity of a user'ssocial graph. We then introduce and analyze variants of this basic scheme exploringcorrelations across our samples. Models of centralized and distributed social networks areconsidered.

This is an important topic because the data obtained using various sensors(examples include GPS data or video tracking data) are typically noisy. The performance ofpreviously used measures is generally degraded under noisy conditions. Here we formalizenon-metric similarity functions based on the Longest Common Subsequence that are veryrobust to noise. Furthermore they provide an intuitive notion of similarity between time-seriesby giving more weight to the similar portions of the sequences. Stretching of sequences intime is allowed; as well as global translating of the sequences in space. Efficientapproximate algorithms that compute these similarity measures are also provided.

Anorectal melanoma: a large clinicopathologic study from India.,Ganesh Das; Samir Gupta; PJ Shukla; P Jagannath,Abstract Anorectal melanoma is a rare tumor. It has dismal prognosis; only 10% of patientslive longer than 5 years. It commonly presents as bleeding from the rectum or as ahemorrhoidal mass. The management of this tumor is controversial. Some authors believethat a palliative local excision is the treatment of choice; whereas others recommend radicalsurgery in localized disease. We present a retrospective analysis of 72 patients who weremanaged at our center between 1990 and 2001. This is the largest series from India. Mostpatients (48/72; 66%) presented with distant metastases. Twenty-four patients (24/72; 33%)underwent an abdomino-perineal resection. Nineteen patients (19/24) had positive lymphnode disease; and the mean disease-free survival in these patients was 10.3 months.Disease-free survival in the node-negative patients was 26.5 months.

A subgraph of the completeEuclidean graph is a t-spanner if for all u and υ in V; the length of the shortest path from u toυ in the spanner is at most t times the Euclidean distance between u and υ. We show that forany δ> 1; there exists a t-spanner (where t is a constant that depends only on δ and k) withthe following properties: its maximum degree is 3; it has at most n· δ edges; its total edgeweight is at most O (1) times the weight of the minimum spanning tree of V; and it can beconstructed in O (n log n) time.

When attribute domains are notavailable; domain discovery becomes a critical challenge facing the application of a broadrange of existing techniques on third-party analytical and mash-up applications over hiddendatabases. In this paper; we consider the problem of domain discovery over a hiddendatabase through its web interface. We prove that for any database schema; an achievabilityguarantee on domain discovery can be made based solely upon the interface design. Wealso develop novel techniques which provide effective guarantees on thecomprehensiveness of domain discovery.

On skyline groups,Chengkai Li; Nan Zhang; Naeemul Hassan; Sundaresan Rajasekaran; Gautam Das,Abstract We formulate and investigate the novel problem of finding the skyline k-tuplegroups from an n-tuple dataset-ie; groups of k tuples which are not dominated by any othergroup of equal size; based on aggregate-based group dominance relationship. The majortechnical challenge is to identify effective anti-monotonic properties for pruning the searchspace of skyline groups. To this end; we show that the anti-monotonic property in the well-known Apriori algorithm does not hold for skyline group pruning. We then identify order-specific property which applies to SUM; MIN; and MAX and weak candidate-generationproperty which applies to MIN and MAX only. Experimental results on both real and syntheticdatasets verify that the proposed algorithms achieve orders of magnitude performance gainover a baseline method.,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,19

Who tags what?: an analysis framework,Mahashweta Das; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Gautam Das; Cong Yu,Abstract The rise of Web 2.0 is signaled by sites such as Flickr; del. icio. us; and YouTube;and social tagging is essential to their success. A typical tagging action involves threecomponents; user; item (eg; photos in Flickr); and tags (ie; words or phrases). Analyzing howtags are assigned by certain users to certain items has important implications in helpingusers search for desired information. In this paper; we explore common analysis tasks andpropose a dual mining framework for social tagging behavior mining. This framework iscentered around two opposing measures; similarity and diversity; being applied to one ormore tagging components; and therefore enables a wide range of analysis scenarios suchas characterizing similar users tagging diverse items with similar tags; or diverse userstagging similar items with diverse tags; etc. By adopting different concrete measures for …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,18
ASAP: Eliminating algorithm-based disclosure in privacy-preserving data publishing,Xin Jin; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,Abstract Numerous privacy-preserving data publishing algorithms were proposed to achieveprivacy guarantees such as ℓ‐diversity. Many of them; however; were recently found to bevulnerable to algorithm-based disclosure—ie; privacy leakage incurred by an adversary whois aware of the privacy-preserving algorithm being used. This paper describes generictechniques for correcting the design of existing privacy-preserving data publishingalgorithms to eliminate algorithm-based disclosure. We first show that algorithm-baseddisclosure is more prevalent and serious than previously studied. Then; we strictly defineAlgorithm-SAfe Publishing (ASAP) to capture and eliminate threats from algorithm-baseddisclosure.

It is common that the user is unsure of his/her preference; so care must be takento elicit the preference of the user correctly. In this paper; we propose to elicit the preferredordering of a user by utilizing skyline objects as the representatives of the possible ordering.We introduce the notion of order-based representative skylines which selectsrepresentatives based on the orderings that they represent. To further facilitate preferenceexploration; a hierarchical clustering algorithm is applied to compute a denogram on theskyline objects. By coupling the hierarchical clustering with visualization techniques; weallow users to refine their preference weight settings by browsing the hierarchy. Extensiveexperiments were conducted and the results validate the feasibility and the efficiency of …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,18

Supporting unified querying over autonomous unstructured and structured databases,*,Methods; systems and computer products perform cost estimate to determine an efficientapproach to answer a query according to one of several unified query plans. One unifiedquery plan involves querying an unstructured database; referencing a unified index; andprobing a structured database based on matches discovered in the unified index. Theresults of the unstructured database query are used to lookup entries in a unified indexassociated with the structured database. Then the structured database is probed byquerying only the subset of the structured database gleaned from the unstructured databasequery.,*,2011,16
Improved search for socially annotated data,Nikos Sarkas; Gautam Das; Nick Koudas,Abstract Social annotation is an intuitive; on-line; collaborative process through which eachelement of a collection of resources (eg; URLs; pictures; videos; etc.) is associated with agroup of descriptive keywords; widely known as tags. Each such group is a concise andaccurate summary of the relevant resource's content and is obtained via aggregating theopinion of individual users; as expressed in the form of short tag sequences. The availabilityof this information gives rise to a new searching paradigm where resources are retrievedand ranked based on the similarity of a keyword query to their accompanying tags. In thispaper; we present a principled and efficient search and resource ranking methodology thatutilizes exclusively the user-assigned tag sequences. Ranking is based on solidprobabilistic foundations and our growing understanding of the dynamics and structure of …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,16
Privacy preservation of aggregates in hidden databases: Why and how?,Arjun Dasgupta; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das; Surajit Chaudhuri,Abstract Many websites provide form-like interfaces which allow users to execute searchqueries on the underlying hidden databases. In this paper; we explain the importance ofprotecting sensitive aggregate information of hidden databases from being disclosedthrough individual tuples returned by the search queries. This stands in contrast to thetraditional privacy problem where individual tuples must be protected while ensuring accessto aggregating information. We propose techniques to thwart bots from sampling the hiddendatabase to infer aggregate information. We present theoretical analysis and extensiveexperiments to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,16

It may be due to mal-interaction between ecto and mesoderm of epithelialbulgings present on premaxillary region at the time of complex odontogenesis. Geneticsmay have some role in the formation of Talon cusp. Talon cusp may cause clinicalcomplications.,Journal of the Indian Society of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry,1999,16
Constructing degree-3 spanners with other sparseness properties,Gautam Das; Paul J Heffernan,Abstract Let V be any set of n points in k-dimensional Euclidean space. A subgraph of thecomplete Euclidean graph is a t-spanner if for any u and v in V; the length of the shortestpath from u to v in the spanner is at most t times d (u; v). We show that for any δ> 1; thereexists a polynomial-time constructible t-spanner (where t is a constant that depends only onδ and k) with the following properties. Its maximum degree is 3; it has at most n· δ edges;and its total edge weight is comparable to the minimum spanning tree of V (for k≤ 3 itsweight is O (1)· wt (MST); and for k> 3 its weight is O (log n)· wt (MST)).,International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation,1993,16

Existingresearch has investigated how to assign workers to such team-based tasks to ensure thebest outcome assuming the skills of individual workers to be known. In this work; weinvestigate how to estimate individual worker's skill based on the outcome of the team-basedtasks they have undertaken. We consider two popular skill aggregation functions andestimate the skill of the workers; where skill is either a deterministic value or a probabilitydistribution. We propose efficient solutions for worker skill estimation using continuous anddiscrete optimization techniques. We present comprehensive experiments and validate thescalability and effectiveness of our proposed solutions using multiple real-world datasets.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,15
Walk; not wait: Faster sampling over online social networks,Azade Nazi; Zhuojie Zhou; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,Abstract In this paper; we introduce a novel; general purpose; technique for faster samplingof nodes over an online social network. Specifically; unlike traditional random walks whichwait for the convergence of sampling distribution to a predetermined target distribution-awaiting process that incurs a high query cost-we develop WALK-ESTIMATE; which startswith a much shorter random walk; and then proactively estimate the sampling probability forthe node taken before using acceptance-rejection sampling to adjust the samplingprobability to the predetermined target distribution. We present a novel backward randomwalk technique which provides provably unbiased estimations for the sampling probability;and demonstrate the superiority of WALK-ESTIMATE over traditional random walks throughtheoretical analysis and extensive experiments over real world online social networks.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,15

Optimization based method for estimating the results of aggregate queries,*,A method for estimating the result of a query on a database having data records arranged intables. The database has an expected workload that includes a set of queries that can beexecuted on the database. A sample is constructed by selecting data records for inclusion inthe sample in a manner that minimizes an estimation error when the data records are actedupon by a query in the expected workload to provide an estimated result. The queryaccesses the sample and is executed on the sample; returning an estimated query result.The expected workload can be constructed by specifying a degree of overlap betweenrecords selected by queries in the given workload and records selected by queries in theexpected workload.,*,2006,15
Finite element modeling of rolling process and optimization of process parameter,AK Datta; Goutam Das; PK De; P Ramachandrarao; M Mukhopadhyaya,Abstract A metal forming process is characterized by various process parameters such asthe shape of the work piece as well as that of the product; forming sequence or passschedule; shapes of tools; friction; temperature; forming speed; material properties of thework piece and those of tools. Product quality and production economy depend on themechanical/thermal/metallurgical behaviours of the work piece and those of the tools; andtherefore; a prerequisite for successful process design is to acquire a process model forpredicting the detailed aspects of these behaviours. Optimization of the process parametersmay then be performed on the basis of such modeling capability. Finite element-basedprocess simulation can offer valuable guidelines on how the current process parametersshould be modified to meet the requirements of the process and the product.

Finding all weakly-visible chords of a polygon in linear time,Gautam Das; Paul J Heffernan; Giri Narasimhan,In this paper we present an optimal-time algorithm which computes all ~eakly-~isible chordsof a simple polygon. For a simple polygon P with n vertices; our algorithm requires time O(n).Previous results [3; 9] require O(nlogn) time and compute only one weakly-visible chord. Wealso consider the case of rectilinear simple polygons; and show a much simpler linear-time algorithmto compute all weakly-visible chords of the polygon. Two sets of points are said to beweahly-~isible if e~erlt point in either set is visible from ~ome point in the other set. Aweakly-vlsible chord c of a polygon P is one such that c and P are weakly-visible.

Leaching of ilmenite ores by acidic chloride solutions,GK Das; Y Pranolo; Z Zhu; CY Cheng,Abstract The direct leaching of Australian ilmenite ore samples with HCl was found to bemuch more effective with high chloride (Cl−) concentration (~ 500 g/L) in the feed solution.The presence of CaCl 2 was more effective for leaching than that of MgCl 2 and NaCl due toits higher solubility. The effects of pulp density; retention time; HCl concentration; CaCl 2concentration and temperature were examined to optimise the leaching conditions. Theoptimum conditions for leaching ilmenite in this study were found to be 5–7.5 M HCl solutionwith a total Cl− concentration of~ 500 g/L; 3.3%(w/w) pulp density; 70–80° C and 4–6 h ofretention time. Under these conditions; the optimum leaching efficiencies were~ 98–99% Tiand 96% Fe for ilmenite ore A and 94% Ti and 93% Fe for ilmenite ore B.

Crucial contribution of the multiple copies of the initiator tRNA genes in the fidelity of tRNA fMet selection on the ribosomal P-site in Escherichia coli,Suman Kapoor; Gautam Das; Umesh Varshney,Abstract The accuracy of the initiator tRNA (tRNA fMet) selection in the ribosomal P-site iscentral to the fidelity of protein synthesis. A highly conserved occurrence of threeconsecutive G–C base pairs in the anticodon stem of tRNA fMet contributes to its preferentialselection in the P-site. In a genetic screen; using a plasmid borne copy of an inactive tRNAfMet mutant wherein the three G–C base pairs were changed; we isolated Escherichia colistrains that allow efficient initiation with the tRNA fMet mutant. Here; extensivecharacterization of two such strains revealed novel mutations in the metZWV promoterseverely compromising tRNA fMet levels. Low cellular abundance of the chromosomallyencoded tRNA fMet allows efficient initiation with the tRNA fMet mutant and an elongatortRNA Gln; revealing that a high abundance of the cellular tRNA fMet is crucial for the …,Nucleic acids research,2010,13

Control and performance of UPFC connected to a transmission line,S Tara Kalyani; G Tulasiram Das,The unified power flow controller (UPFC) is the most versatile and complex power electronicequipment that has emerged for the control and optimization of power flow in electricalpower transmission system. This paper presents control and performance of UPFC intendedfor installation on a transmission line. A control system which enables the UPFC to follow thechanges in reference values like AC voltage; DC voltage and angle order of the seriesinjected voltage is proposed. In this control system; a generalized pulse width modulationtechnique is used to generate firing pulses for both the converters.

Computing best coverage path in the presence of obstacles in a sensor field,Senjuti Basu Roy; Gautam Das; Sajal Das,Abstract We study the presence of obstacles in computing BCP (s; t)(Best Coverage Pathbetween two points s and t) in a 2D field under surveillance by sensors. Consider a set of mline segment obstacles and n point sensors on the plane. For any path between s to t; p isthe least protected point along the path such that the Euclidean distance between p and itsclosest sensor is maximum. This distance (the path's cover value) is minimum for a BCP (s;t). We present two algorithmic results. For opaque obstacles; ie; which obstruct paths andblock sensing capabilities of sensors; computation of BCP (s; t) takes O ((m 2 n 2+ n 4) log(mn+ n 2)) time and O (m 2 n 2+ n 4) space. For transparent obstacles; ie; which onlyobstruct paths; but allows sensing; computation of BCP (s; t) takes O (nm 2+ n 3) time and O(m 2+ n 2) space. We believe; this is one of the first efforts to study the presence of …,Workshop on Algorithms and Data Structures,2007,12

Minimum standards processing and photograph collections,Anne L Foster,Photograph collections and photos in collections have long posed particular challenges forarchivists. Archival institutions have employed a variety of arrangement and descriptiontechniques to ensure the preservation and access of photographic images. Many of thesesolutions; however; require item-level attention. With the advent of minimum standards; or"MPLP"(More Product; Less Process); processing; archivists are beginning to question suchpractices. This paper offers a case study of implementing MPLP for collections that compriseor include photographs. A variety of photographic collections are examined and differentlevels of minimum standards discussed. Also examined is the potential conflict betweenMPLP and another recent trend in archives—digitization of photographs.,Archival Issues,2006,12

Over-exploitation associated changes in free radicals and its scavengers in Hevea brasiliensis,Gitali Das; Badre Alam; Shammi Raj; SK Dey; MR Sethuraj; Swati Sen-Mandi,TPD was more in the frequently tapped trees than in the stimulated ones. Interestinglyhowever; at the 1 15th actual tapping; the occurrence of TPD was found to be higher in thestimulated samples than that of in the frequently tapped plants. The control plants showedno TPD syndrome in both cases. This implies that excess generation of active oxygen withdefective defense mechanism (in terms of SOD) along with frequency of exploitation;sourcesink imbalance etc. may determine the yielding potential and the TPD incidence inrubber,Journal of Rubber Research,2002,12
Root formation in deteriorated (aged) wheat embryos,Gitali Das; Swati Sen-Mandi,Inability of aged seeds to grow into successful plants in the field is primarily due to their age-associated loss of rooting ability. The present work describes an attempt to initiate roots innonrooting aged embryos of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Data presented give acomparative study of root formation and seedling growth on different culture media.

Elucidation of caveolin 1 both as a tumor suppressor and metastasis promoter in light of epigenetic modulators,Moonmoon Deb; Dipta Sengupta; Swayamsiddha Kar; Sandip Kumar Rath; Sabnam Parbin; Arunima Shilpi; Subhendu Roy; Gautam Das; Samir Kumar Patra,Abstract Caveolin-1 (CAV1) is an integral part of plasma membrane protein playing a vitalrole in breast cancer initiation and progression. CAV1 acts both as a tumor suppressor aswell as an oncogene; and its activity is thus highly dependent on cellular environment.Keeping this fact in mind; the recent work is designed to reveal the role of CAV1 in inhibitingcancer cell progression in presence of epigenetic modulators like 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine(AZA); trichostatin A (TSA); S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and sulforaphane (SFN). Forcedexpression of CAV1 by AZA; TSA; and SFN is correlated to induction of apoptosis andinhibition of cell migration in breast cancer. In breast cancer along with promoter DNAmethylation; other epigenetic mechanisms are also involved in CAV1 expression.

An expressive framework and efficient algorithms for the analysis of collaborative tagging,Mahashweta Das; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Gautam Das; Cong Yu,Abstract The rise of Web 2.0 is signaled by sites such as Flickr; del. icio. us; and YouTube;and social tagging is essential to their success. A typical tagging action involves threecomponents; user; item (eg; photos in Flickr); and tag s (ie; words or phrases). Analyzinghow tags are assigned by certain users to certain items has important implications in helpingusers search for desired information. In this paper; we develop a dual mining framework toexplore tagging behavior. This framework is centered around two opposing measures;similarity and diversity; applied to one or more tagging components; and therefore enables awide range of analysis scenarios such as characterizing similar users tagging diverse itemswith similar tags or diverse users tagging similar items with diverse tags.

Role of methods of blending on polymer–polymer compatibility,Gaurab Das; AN Banerjee,Abstract The role of methods of blend preparation on polymer-polymer compatibility wasinvestigated. Three different types of methods of blending; such as solution-casting; melt-mixing; and coprecipitation; were applied for three types of blend systems; viz.; poly (vinylchloride-co-vinyl acetate)(VYHH)/polystyrene (PS); VYHH/poly (styrene-co-acrylonitrile)(SAN); and VYHH/poly (methyl methacrylate)(PMMA) by measuring their glasstransition temperatures (T g) by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). It has been foundthat compatibility of the polymers depends on the method of blending and compatibility alsovaries from one blend system to another. Among the various types of blending methods; thecoprecipitation method of blending gives the best compatibility result.© 1996 John Wiley &Sons; Inc.,Journal of applied polymer science,1996,10

The compatibility of the blends was studied by measuring the glass-transition temperatures (T gs) of the blends and also by measuring the heat capactiy change(ΔC p) at the glass transition temperature for each blend using differential scanningcalorimetry (DSC). The presence of either one or two T gs has been used as a criterion todetermine the miscibility of each blend over a range of composition. It was found that formiscible blends the heat-capacity changes are equal to the calculated values; but forimmiscible blends the experimental ΔC p is smaller than the calculated value.

Probabilistic analysis of suction in homogeneously vegetated soils,B Hazra; V Gadi; A Garg; CWW Ng; GK Das,Abstract It is unlikely that natural vegetation growth induced soil suction can be predicteddeterministically. Probabilistic approach may be an ideal tool to analyse effects ofevapotranspiration (ET) induced suction by vegetation; which are commonly found onslopes. Most of the previous deterministic studies quantifying suction are carried out onnatural slopes; which are heterogeneous in nature. The main objective of this study is toconduct probabilistic analysis of measured soil suction in homogeneously vegetated slopes.In the present work; a probabilistic model is developed for the measured values of suction;since the measurement process itself is very uncertain and is subjected to a wide range ofclimatic fluctuations owing to a wide monitoring interval. Expected values of soil suction arefound to be significantly higher in treed slope as compared to grassed and bare slope. In …,Catena,2017,9

Recently; LRRK2 has also been shown by genome wide association (GWA) studies tobe a susceptibility gene for the disease. In India mutations in LRRK2 is a rare cause of PD.We; therefore; genotyped 64 SNPs across LRRK2 in 161 control samples and finally studied6 haplotype tagging SNPs for association-based study on 300 cases and 446 ethnicallymatched controls to explore the potential role of LRRK2 as a susceptibility gene in PD forEast Indians. We did not find any significant allele/genotype or haplotype associations withPD suggesting that common genetic variants within LRRK2 play limited role in modulatingPD among East Indians. In addition; we also screened for the common mutations (viz. p.R1441C; p. R1441G; p. R1441H; p. Y1699C; p. G2019S); and a risk variant common …,Disease markers,2012,9

HDSampler: revealing data behind web form interfaces,Anirban Maiti; Arjun Dasgupta; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,Abstract A large number of online databases are hidden behind the web. Users to thesesystems can form queries through web forms to retrieve a small sample of the database.Sampling such hidden databases is widely desired for understanding the nature and qualityof data stored in them. We have developed HDSampler; which to the best of our knowledgeis the first practical system for sampling structured hidden web databases. It enables efficientsampling of the databases and accurate answering of aggregate queries; to provideanalysts with valuable information for data analytics; as well as help power a multitude ofthird-party applications such as web-mashups and meta-search engines. For the purpose ofthis demo; we present an instance of HDSampler on Google Base-a content-rich hiddenweb database maintained by Google. By using HDSampler; the demo reveals a snapshot …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,9

XML query routing in structured P2P systems,Leonidas Fegaras; Weimin He; Gautam Das; David Levine,Abstract This paper addresses the problem of data placement; indexing; and querying largeXML data repositories distributed over an existing P2P service infrastructure. Ourarchitecture scales gracefully to the network and data sizes; is fully distributed; fault tolerantand self-organizing; and handles complex queries efficiently; even those queries that usefull-text search. Our framework for indexing distributed XML data is based on both meta-datainformation and textual content. We introduce a novel data synopsis structure to summarizetext that correlates textual with positional information and increases query routing precision.Our processing framework maps an XML query with full-text search into a distributedprogram that migrates from peer to peer; collecting relevant document locations along theway. In addition; we introduce methods to handle network updates; such as node arrivals …,*,2007,9
Dual blockade of renin-angiotensin system in diabetic nephropathy: review of literature and local experience,Parijat De; Gautam Das; Karen Harley; Harikrishan Nair,Albuminuria and hypertension are predictors of poor renal and cardiovascular outcome inpatients with diabetic nephropathy (DN). Intensive treatment requires blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by either angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors orangiotensin receptor blockers (ARB); which reduce blood pressure and proteinuria.Combining the two therapies has shown greater benefits than either drug alone to reduceprogression of DN. Although treatment goals are more likely to be achieved with thecombination; this requires close monitoring of serum creatinine and potassium whichinvariably rise on such therapy.,*,2006,9

Discovering the skyline of web databases,Abolfazl Asudeh; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,Abstract Many web databases are" hidden" behind proprietary search interfaces that enforcethe top-k output constraint; ie; each query returns at most k of all matching tuples;preferentially selected and returned according to a proprietary ranking function. In thispaper; we initiate research into the novel problem of skyline discovery over top-k hiddenweb databases. Since skyline tuples provide critical insights into the database and includethe top-ranked tuple for every possible ranking function following the monotonic order ofattribute values; skyline discovery from a hidden web database can enable a wide variety ofinnovative third-party applications over one or multiple web databases. Our research in thepaper shows that the critical factor affecting the cost of skyline discovery is the type of searchinterface controls provided by the website. As such; we develop efficient algorithms for …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,8
Observation of dopant-profile independent electron transport in sub-monolayer TiOx stacked ZnO thin films grown by atomic layer deposition,D Saha; P Misra; Gangadhar Das; MP Joshi; LM Kukreja,Dopant-profile independent electron transport has been observed through a combined studyof temperature dependent electrical resistivity and magnetoresistance measurements on aseries of Ti incorporated ZnO thin films with varying degree of static-disorder. These filmswere grown by atomic layer deposition through in-situ vertical stacking of multiple sub-monolayers of TiOx in ZnO. Upon decreasing ZnO spacer layer thickness; electron transportsmoothly evolved from a good metallic to an incipient non-metallic regime due to theintricate interplay of screening of spatial potential fluctuations and strength of static-disorderin the films. Temperature dependent phase-coherence length as extracted from themagnetotransport measurement revealed insignificant role of inter sub-monolayer scatteringas an additional channel for electron dephasing; indicating that films were …,Applied Physics Letters,2016,8

Approximation algorithms for maximum independent set of a unit disk graph,Gautam K Das; Minati De; Sudeshna Kolay; Subhas C Nandy; Susmita Sur-Kolay,Abstract We propose a 2-approximation algorithm for the maximum independent setproblem for a unit disk graph. The time and space complexities are O (n 3) and O (n 2);respectively. For a penny graph; our proposed 2-approximation algorithm works in O (n log⁡n) time using O (n) space. We also propose a polynomial-time approximation scheme(PTAS) for the maximum independent set problem for a unit disk graph. Given an integer k>1; it produces a solution of size 1 (1+ 1 k) 2| OPT| in O (k 4 n σ k log⁡ k+ n log⁡ n) time andO (n+ k log⁡ k) space; where OPT is the subset of disks in an optimal solution and σ k≤ 7 k3+ 2.

Image processing and statistical analysis of microstructures of as plasma sprayed Alumina–13 wt.% Titania coatings,R Venkataraman; Gautam Das; B Venkataraman; GV Narashima Rao; R Krishnamurthy,Abstract Plasma spraying of Alumina-13 wt.% Titania coatings in the as sprayed conditionsshow preferentially stabilized α phase. The morphology of this residual α phase are of twotypes a partially melted particle type prevailing as rounded or nearly spherical shaped formand the other splats type; a disc shaped caused by the high impact and rapid solidification ofthe fully molten plume. While the former is totally deleterious to the mechanical propertiesthe latter type of morphology is found to strengthen and toughen the matrix due to theinherent larger stiffness of the residual α phase and also as a result of effective operation oftoughening mechanisms such as crack bridging and crack deflection.

Optimally computing a shortest weakly visible line segment inside a simple polygon,Binay K Bhattacharya; Gautam Das; Asish Mukhopadhyay; Giri Narasimhan,Abstract A simple polygon is said to be weakly internally visible from a line segment lyinginside it if every point on the boundary of the polygon is visible from some point on the linesegment. In this paper; we present an optimal linear-time algorithm for the followingproblem: Given a simple polygon; either compute a shortest line segment from which thepolygon is weakly internally visible; or report that the polygon is not weakly internally visible.The algorithm presented is conceptually simple. This paper also incorporates a significantimprovement over the linear-time algorithm for the same problem; presented in a preliminaryversion [12]; in the sense that it eliminates the need for using two complicated preprocessingtools: Chazelle's linear-time triangulation algorithm [7]; and the algorithm for computingsingle-source-shortest-paths from a specified vertex in a triangulated polygon [16]; thus …,Computational Geometry,2002,8

The fishes are separated into two groups-Sub Adult andadult stage. The growth performance of length-weight relationship is found high since thecorrelation coefficient 'r'exhibits high degree of relationship but shows negative allometriccorrelation. The negative allometric growth may be due to lower feeding proficiencies and/ormay be due to environmental or seasonal incompatibility for proper growth of fishes. Thepresent findings also indicate that the value of 'b'in all cases is lower than 3.0; being aconstant for an ideal fish.

Mining a search engine's corpus without a query pool,Mingyang Zhang; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,Abstract Many websites (eg; WedMD. com; CNN. com) provide keyword search interfacesover a large corpus of documents. Meanwhile; many third parties (eg; investors; analysts)are interested in learning big-picture analytical information over such a document corpus;but have no direct way of accessing it other than using the highly restrictive web searchinterface. In this paper; we study how to enable third-party data analytics over a searchengine's corpus without the cooperation of its owner-specifically; by issuing a small numberof search queries through the web interface. Almost all existing techniques require a pre-constructed query pool-ie; a small yet comprehensive collection of queries which; if allissued through the search interface; can recall almost all documents in the corpus. Theproblem with this requirement is that a``good''query pool can only be constructed by …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,7
Using ball indentation to determine the mechanical properties of an Al-7475 alloy processed by high-pressure torsion,Deepak C Patil; SA Kori; K Venkateswarlu; Gautam Das; Saleh N Alhajeri; Terence G Langdon,Abstract A commercial Al-7475 alloy with an initial grain size of~ 40 μm was processed byhigh-pressure torsion (HPT) for up to 2 turns at room temperature under a pressure of 6.0GPa. The mechanical properties of the processed materials were evaluated by the ball-indentation technique to give information on the yield strength and the ultimate tensilestrength. Following HPT; microhardness measurements revealed a steady increase in thehardness values from the centers of the samples towards the edges. After 2 turns; theultimate tensile strength was~ 1050 MPa at the edge of the disk and the measured grain sizewas~ 70 nm. The results demonstrate the potential for using HPT to achieve excellent grainrefinement in the Al-7475 alloy.,Journal of Materials Science,2013,7
Breaking the top-k barrier of hidden web databases?,Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,A large number of web databases are only accessible through proprietary form-likeinterfaces which require users to query the system by entering desired values for a fewattributes. A key restriction enforced by such an interface is the top-k output constraint-ie;when there are a large number of matching tuples; only a few (top-k) of them arepreferentially selected and returned by the website; often according to a proprietary rankingfunction. Since most web database owners set k to be a small value; the top-k outputconstraint prevents many interesting third-party (eg; mashup) services from being developedover real-world web databases. In this paper we consider the novel problem of “diggingdeeper” into such web databases.

Maprat: Meaningful explanation; interactive exploration and geo-visualization of collaborative ratings,Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Mahashweta Das; Shrikant Desai; Sihem Amer-Yahia; Gautam Das; Cong Yu,Abstract Collaborative rating sites such as IMDB and Yelp have become rich resources thatusers consult to form judgments about and choose from among competing items. Most ofthese sites either provide a plethora of information for users to interpret all by themselves ora simple overall aggregate information. Such aggregates (eg; average rating over all userswho have rated an item; aggregates along pre-defined dimensions; etc.) can not help a userquickly decide the desirability of an item. In this paper; we build a system MapRat that allowsa user to explore multiple carefully chosen aggregate analytic details over a set of userdemographics that meaningfully explain the ratings associated with item (s) of interest.MapRat allows a user to systematically explore; visualize and understand user ratingpatterns of input item (s) so as to make an informed decision quickly.

Novel feeding mechanism to stimulate triple radiating modes in cylindrical dielectric resonator antenna,Anand Sharma; Gourab Das; Pinku Ranjan; Nikesh Kumar Sahu; Ravi Kumar Gangwar,This paper examines a triple band cylindrical dielectric resonator antenna (CDRA) with threedifferent radiating modes; ie; HEM118; TM018; and HEM128. Excitation of all these radiatingmodes simultaneously; in CDRA; is the most challenging task; which have beenaccomplished by using composite feeding structure [combination of vertical strip and psi-shaped (ψ) microstrip line]. Out of three radiating mode; two hybrid modes (ie; HEM118 andHEM128) radiate in broadside direction; while remaining one (TM018) creates monopolelike radiation pattern. Diversified radiation patterns make the proposed CDRA suitable fordifferent wireless applications.

Minimum dominating set problem for unit disks revisited,Paz Carmi; Gautam K Das; Ramesh K Jallu; Subhas C Nandy; Prajwal R Prasad; Yael Stein,In this article; we study approximation algorithms for the problem of computing minimumdominating set for a given set S of n unit disks in ℝ 2. We first present a simple O (n log k)time 5-factor approximation algorithm for this problem; where k is the size of the output. Thebest known 4-factor and 3-factor approximation algorithms for the same problem run in timeO (n 8 log n) and O (n 15 log n) respectively [M. De; GK Das; P. Carmi and SC Nandy;Approximation algorithms for a variant of discrete piercing set problem for unit disks; Int. J. ofComputational Geometry and Appl.; 22 (6): 461–477; 2013]. We show that the timecomplexity of the in-place 4-factor approximation algorithm for this problem can be improvedto O (n 6 log n). A minor modification of this algorithm produces a 14 3-factor approximationalgorithm in O (n 5 log n) time.

Aggregate estimations over location based services,Weimo Liu; Md Farhadur Rahman; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,Abstract Location based services (LBS) have become very popular in recent years. Theyrange from map services (eg; Google Maps) that store geographic locations of points ofinterests; to online social networks (eg; WeChat; Sina Weibo; FourSquare) that leverageuser geographic locations to enable various recommendation functions. The public queryinterfaces of these services may be abstractly modeled as a kNN interface over a databaseof two dimensional points on a plane: given an arbitrary query point; the system returns the kpoints in the database that are nearest to the query point. In this paper we consider theproblem of obtaining approximate estimates of SUM and COUNT aggregates by onlyquerying such databases via their restrictive public interfaces. We distinguish betweeninterfaces that return location information of the returned tuples (eg; Google Maps); and …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,6

Length-Weight relationship and relative condition factor of Labeo bata (Hamilton; 1822) of Deepor beel; a Ramsar site of Assam; India,Gautam Das; Himaksheeta Chakravorty; Parag Deka,Abstract The present study deals with the length-weight relationship; relative condition factorof a fish species Labeo bata (Hamilton; 1822) of Deepar Beel (wetland) of Assam. The fish isseparated into male and female to calculate length-weight relationship and relativecondition factor separately. The growth performance of length-weight relationship are foundhigh in both the sexes since the correlation coefficient 'r'exhibits high degree of relationshipwhere positive allometric growth is shown by male and negative by female. The positiveallometric growth in male may be due to higher feeding proficiencies and betterenvironmental condition whereas negative allometric growth in female may be the result ofloss of energy due to gonad development during breeding season of the present study. Thepresent findings also indicate that the value of 'b'in both the sexes is deviated from 3.0 …,International Journal of Applied Research,2015,6

Effect of synchrotron polarization on grazing incidence X-ray fluorescence analysis,Gangadhar Das; MK Tiwari; AK Singh; Haranath Ghosh,Total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) spectroscopy has seen remarkable progress overthe past years. Numerous applications in basic and applied sciences prove its importance.The large spectral background; which is a major detrimental factor in the conventional X-rayfluorescence technique; limits the element detection sensitivities of the technique to the μgg− 1 (ppm) range. This spectral background is reduced to a great extent in the TXRFtechnique due to the low extinction depth of the primary incident X-ray beam. In synchrotronradiation (SR) based TXRF measurements the spectral background is reduced furtherbecause of the polarization of the synchrotron X-ray beam. Here; we show in detail theinfluence of synchrotron polarization on the spectral background in a fluorescence spectrumand its significance towards TXRF detection sensitivities.

Sequestration of PDC‐109 Protein by Specific Antibodies and Egg Yolk Cryoprotects Bull Spermatozoa,N Srivastava; SK Srivastava; SK Ghosh; A Jerome; GK Das; S Mehrotra,PDC-109; one of the most abundant proteins in bovine seminal plasma; has detrimentaleffect on spermatozoa in a time-and concentration-dependent manner. Therefore; wehypothesized that sequestration of detrimental protein from ejaculates would be beneficialfollowing cryopreservation of sperm cells. To this aim; we evaluated the effect ofsequestration of PDC-109 either by anti-PDC-109 antibodies (Ab) or egg yolk (EY) alone orby the synergistic action of EY+ Ab in minimizing cryoinjury to bull spermatozoa. PDC-109protein was purified by applying two-step chromatography procedures. The purified proteinwas injected in rabbits to raise antibodies which were isolated using ion-exchangechromatography. After checking the Ab cross-reactivity; they were quantitated and added toejaculates; either alone or in addition to EY in Tris-glycerol (TG) extender. Thus …,Reproduction in Domestic Animals,2013,6

Mining chains of relations,Foto Aftrati; Gautam Das; Aristides Gionis; Heikki Mannila; Taneli Mielikäinen; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Abstract Traditional data mining methods consider the problem of mining a single relationthat relates two different attributes. For example; in a scientific bibliography database;authors are related to papers; and we may be interested in discovering association rulesbetween authors based on the papers that they have co-authored. However; in real life it isoften the case that we have multiple attributes related through chains of relations. Forexample; authors write papers; and papers belong to one or more topics; defining a three-level chain of relations. In this paper we consider the problem of mining such relationalchains. We formulate a generic problem of finding selector sets (subsets of objects from oneof the attributes) such that the projected dataset—the part of the dataset determined by theselector set—satisfies a specific property.

An access cost-aware approach for object retrieval over multiple sources,Benjamin Arai; Gautam Das; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vagelis Hristidis; Nick Koudas,Abstract Source and object selection and retrieval from large multi-source data sets arefundamental operations in many applications. In this paper; we initiate research on efficientsource (eg; database) and object selection algorithms on large multi-source data sets.Specifically; in order to acquire a specified number of satisfying objects with minimum costover multiple databases; the query engine needs to determine the access overhead forindividual data sources; the overhead of retrieving objects from each source; and possiblyother statistics such as estimating the frequency of finding a satisfying object in order todetermine how many objects to retrieve from each data source. We adopt a probabilisticapproach to source selection utilizing a cost structure and a dynamic programming model forcomputing the optimal number of objects to retrieve from each data source.

STAR: A System for Tuple and Attribute Ranking of Query Answers.,Nishant Kapoor; Gautam Das; Vagelis Hristidis; S Sudarshan; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract In recent years there has been a great deal of interest in developing effectivetechniques for ad-hoc search and retrieval in structured repositories such as relationaldatabases-eg; searching online databases of homes; used cars; and electronic goods. Inmany of these applications; the user often experiences “information overload”; which occurswhen the system responds to an under-specified user query by returning an overwhelmingnumber of tuples; each displayed with a huge number of features (or attributes). We havedeveloped a search and retrieval system that tackles this information overload problem fromtwo angles. First; we show how to automatically rank and display the top-n most relevanttuples. Second; our system offers techniques for ordering the attributes of the returned tuplesin decreasing order of “usefulness” and selects only a few of the most useful attributes to …,ICDE,2007,6
Mining chains of relations,Foto Afrati; Gautam Das; Aristides Gionis; Heikki Mannila; Taneli Mielikainen; Panayiotis Tsaparas,Traditional data mining applications consider the problem of mining a single relationbetween two attributes.

Sampling methods in approximate query answering systems,Gautam Das,Abstract In recent years; advances in data collection and management technologies haveled to a proliferation of very large databases. These large data repositories typically arecreated in the hope that; through analysis such as data mining and decision support; theywill yield new insights into the data and the real-world processes that created them. Inpractice; however; while the collection and storage of massive datasets has becomerelatively straightforward; effective data analysis has proven more difficult to achieve. Onereason that data analysis successes have proven elusive is that most analysis queries; bytheir nature; require aggregation or summarization of large portions of the data beinganalyzed. For multi-gigabyte data repositories; this means that processing even a singleanalysis query involves accessing enormous amounts of data; leading to prohibitively …,*,2005,6
CORROSION BEHAVIOUR OF PIPELINE STEEL IN CO,GS Das; AS Khanna,ABSTRACT The influence of temperature (30-120oC) on the corrosion behavior of lowcarbon pipeline steels in the CO2 saturated solutions in the closed autoclave system hasbeen studied. At lower temperatures; the surface films have an open porous structure andhence the FeCO3 film formed dissolved continuously in the CO2 saturated solution.Between 60 to 90oC; the FeCO3 film accumulated more in the outer part; which is moreporous; less dense and nonprotective in nature and hence the corrosion rates of samplesincrease with temperature. Incontrast; above 90oC; a dense protective FeCO3 film is formedand the corrosion rate decreases significantly at 120oC.,Trans. Indian Inst. Met,2004,6
Dbxplorer: enabling keyword search over relational databases,Surajit Chaudhuri San Jay Agrawal; Gautam Das,Abstract While relational database systems offer powerfifl structured query languages suchas SQL; there is no support for keyword search over databases. The simplicity of keywordsearch as a querying paradigm offers compelling values for data exploration. Specifically;keyword search does not require a priori knowledge of the schema. The above is significantas much information in a corporation is increasingly being available at its intranet. However;it is unrealistic to expect users who would browse and query such information to havedetailed knowledge of the schema of available databases. Therefore; just as keywordsearch and classification hierarchies complement each other for document search; keywordsearch over databases can be effective. 2.

An extended Shine–Dalgarno sequence in mRNA functionally bypasses a vital defect in initiator tRNA,Sunil Shetty; HimaPriyanka Nadimpalli; Riyaz Ahmad Shah; Smriti Arora; Gautam Das; Umesh Varshney,Abstract Initiator tRNAs are special in their direct binding to the ribosomal P-site due to thehallmark occurrence of the three consecutive GC base pairs (3GC pairs) in their anticodonstems. How the 3GC pairs function in this role; has remained unsolved. We show thatmutations in either the mRNA or 16S rRNA leading to extended interaction between theShine–Dalgarno (SD) and anti-SD sequences compensate for the vital need of the 3GCpairs in tRNA fMet for its function in Escherichia coli. In vivo; the 3GC mutant tRNA fMetoccurred less abundantly in 70S ribosomes but normally on 30S subunits. However; theextended SD: anti-SD interaction increased its occurrence in 70S ribosomes. We proposethat the 3GC pairs play a critical role in tRNA fMet retention in ribosome during theconformational changes that mark the transition of 30S preinitiation complex into …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2014,5

However; most microblogging platforms impose strictaccess restrictions (eg; API rate limits) that prevent scientists with limited resources-eg; whocannot afford microblog-data-access subscriptions offered by GNIP et al.-to leverage thewealth of microblogs for analytics. For example; Twitter allows only 180 queries per 15minutes; and its search API only returns tweets posted within the last week.

A review of endocrine disorders in thalassaemia,Parijat De; Radhika Mistry; Christine Wright; Shivan Pancham; Wyn Burbridge; Kalyan Gangopadhayay; Terence Pang; Gautam Das,Endocrine dysfunction in thalassaemia is amongst the most common complication and isprincipally attributed to excessive iron overload and suboptimal chelation. The prevalence isquite high particularly in multiethnic populations but determining the prevalence is oftendifficult due to the widespread heterogeneity of the population and timing of exposure tochelation therapy. Disturbances in growth; pubertal development; abnormal gonadalfunctions; impaired thyroid; parathyroid and adrenal functions; diabetes and disorderly bonegrowth are commonly encountered. Early detection and institution of appropriate transfusionregimen and chelation therapy and treatment of complications are the keys to managing thispopulation including regular follow. In this article; we review the literature in relation to thevarious endocrine complications encountered in thalassaemia.,Open Journal of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases,2014,5

Rank discovery from web databases,Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,Abstract Many web databases are only accessible through a proprietary search interfacewhich allows users to form a query by entering the desired values for a few attributes. Afterreceiving a query; the system returns the top-k matching tuples according to a pre-determined ranking function. Since the rank of a tuple largely determines the attention itreceives from website users; ranking information for any tuple-not just the top-ranked ones-isoften of significant interest to third parties such as sellers; customers; market researchersand investors. In this paper; we define a novel problem of rank discovery over hidden webdatabases. We introduce a taxonomy of ranking functions; and show that different types ofranking functions require fundamentally different approaches for rank discovery.

Improved interference in wireless sensor networks,Pragya Agrawal; Gautam K Das,Abstract Given a set \calV of n sensor nodes distributed on a 2-dimensional plane and asource node s∈\calV; the interference problem deals with assigning transmission range toeach v∈\calV such that the members in \calV maintain connectivity predicate \calP; and themaximum/total interference of the network is minimum. We propose algorithm for bothminimizing maximum interference and minimizing total interference of the networks. Forminimizing maximum interference we present optimum solution with running timeO((\calP_n+n^2)\logn) for connectivity predicate \calP like strong connectivity; broadcast (s isthe source); k-edge (vertex) connectivity; spanner; where O(\calP_n) is the time complexityfor checking the connectivity predicate \calP. The running time of the previous best knownsolution was O(\calP_n*n^2) 3.

Grain size analysis of some beach sands from the Indian Coasts,Gautam Kumar Das,Abstract: A long stretch ofabout 8 129 Km length of Indian coastline registers variousdepositional environments particularly in the intertidal zone of sea beaches. There areinnunerable sea beaches in the peninsular Indian sub-Colliittelit. Sea beaches of Indiaricoast experience the regular effects of vaves and tidal currents. Texturally the beachsediments are sandy in nature. Surface physical structures are rare in the intertidal zones ofthe sea beaches. Under this situation; composition ofbeach materials including lithogenicand biogenic constituents and their distributions would be the unique means for theinterpretation ofthe beach characteristics along with related beach processes.

Rheological studies of the poly (styrene‐co‐acrylonitrile) and poly (vinyl chloride‐co‐vinyl acetate) blends,Gaurab Das; AN Banerjee,Abstract The rheological studies of the poly (vinyl chloride-co-vinyl acetate) and poly(styrene-co-vinyl acetate) and poly (styrene-co-acrylonitrile) blends were performed by aBrabender Rheotron at three different temperatures and also at different shear rates. Flowcurves of the blends at different temperatures were drawn. The flow behavior index and;also; zero-shear viscosity of the blends at different temperatures were determined. From theflow curves; it has been found that as shear stress increases; melt viscosity decreases at alltemperatures; indicating that pseudoplastic behavior and experimental values lies above theline of the log-additivity value and below the line of the additivity rule of mixture.© 1998 JohnWiley & Sons; Inc.

Minimum vertex hulls for polyhedral domains,Gautam Das; Deborah Joseph,In this paper we investigate several variations of the following problem: Given a collection ofpairwise disjoint polygons and their spatial positions in the plane; cover each with apolygonal hull such that (i) the hulls are pairwise disjoint; and (ii) the total number of verticesof the hulls is minimized. This problem can be readily extended to three dimensions; wherepolyhedrons replace polygons; or it can be restricted to special types of polygons such asrectilinear polygons or convex polygons. If the objects are sufficiently far apart; each objectcan be enclosed in a triangle (or tetrahedron); however; if the objects are placed closertogether; then because we require that the hulls are disjoint the problem is nontrivial. Ourproblem belongs to the important area of object approximations; where the goal is toapproximate complex objects by simpler shapes [A; AB; CY; KL].

Positive resultswere obtained only on fruits sized 1 1/4 to 3 1/2 in.; up to 50 per cent. of which contracted thedisorder. Of the many solvents tested; besides mango juice; ether and chloroform (especiallythe former) readily absorbed the necrosis-inducing constituent of the fumes; and half thefruits injected with the ether-soluble portion; developed the symptom. Of the three fractionsseparated from the ether-soluble components of the fumes; one crystallizing in hexagonalform proved to be capable of causing necrosis.,Current science,1950,5
Distributed construction of connected dominating set in unit disk graphs,Ramesh K Jallu; Prajwal R Prasad; Gautam K Das,Abstract Let G=(V; E) be a unit disk graph corresponding to a given set P of n points in R 2.We propose a distributed approximation algorithm to find a minimum connected dominatingset of G. The maintenance of the connected dominating set constructed is fully localized. Ouralgorithm produces a connected dominating set of size (104 op t+ 52); where opt is the sizeof a minimum connected dominating set. The time and message complexities of ouralgorithm are O (Δ) and O (n) respectively; where Δ and n are the maximum node degreeand number of nodes in G respectively. Our distributed approximation algorithm outperformsexisting algorithms in terms of its time and message complexities. We also propose ascheduling scheme that obtains O (Δ) conflict-free time slots to deal with interference.,Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,2017,4
Efficient computation of regret-ratio minimizing set: A compact maxima representative,Abolfazl Asudeh; Azade Nazi; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,Abstract Finding the maxima of a database based on a user preference; especially when theranking function is a linear combination of the attributes; has been the subject of recentresearch. A critical observation is that the em convex hull is the subset of tuples that can beused to find the maxima of any linear function. However; in real world applications theconvex hull can be a significant portion of the database; and thus its performance is greatlyreduced. Thus; computing a subset limited to $ r $ tuples that minimizes the regret ratio (ameasure of the user's dissatisfaction with the result from the limited set versus the one fromthe entire database) is of interest. In this paper; we make several fundamental theoretical aswell as practical advances in developing such a compact set.

A holistic and principled approach for the empty-answer problem,Davide Mottin; Alice Marascu; Senjuti Basu Roy; Gautam Das; Themis Palpanas; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract We propose a principled optimization-based interactive query relaxation frameworkfor queries that return no answers. Given an initial query that returns an empty-answer set;our framework dynamically computes and suggests alternative queries with fewer conditionsthan those the user has initially requested; in order to help the user arrive at a query with anon-empty-answer; or at a query for which no matter how many additional conditions areignored; the answer will still be empty. Our proposed approach for suggesting queryrelaxations is driven by a novel probabilistic framework based on optimizing a wide varietyof application-dependent objective functions. We describe optimal and approximatesolutions of different optimization problems using the framework. Moreover; we discuss twoimportant extensions to the base framework: the specification of a minimum size on the …,The VLDB Journal,2016,4
Query reranking as a service,Abolfazl Asudeh; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,Abstract The ranked retrieval model has rapidly become the de facto way for search queryprocessing in client-server databases; especially those on the web. Despite of the extensiveefforts in the database community on designing better ranking functions/mechanisms; manysuch databases in practice still fail to address the diverse and sometimes contradictingpreferences of users on tuple ranking; perhaps (at least partially) due to the lack of expertiseand/or motivation for the database owner to design truly effective ranking functions. Thispaper takes a different route on addressing the issue by defining a novel query rerankingproblem; ie; we aim to design a third-party service that uses nothing but the public searchinterface of a client-server database to enable the on-the-fly processing of queries with anyuser-specified ranking functions (with or without selection conditions); no matter if the …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,4
Exploring interface morphology of a deeply buried layer in periodic multilayer,Gangadhar Das; Ajay Khooha; AK Singh; AK Srivastava; MK Tiwari,Long-term durability of a thin film device is strongly correlated with the nature of interfacestructure associated between different constituent layers. Synthetic periodic multilayerstructures are primarily employed as artificial X-ray Bragg reflectors in many applications;and their reflection efficiency is predominantly dictated by the nature of the buried interfacesbetween the different layers. Herein; we demonstrate the applicability of the combinedanalysis approach of the X-ray reflectivity and grazing incidence X-ray fluorescencemeasurements for the reliable and precise determination of a buried interface structureinside periodic X-ray multilayer structures.

Randomized generalization for aggregate suppression over hidden web databases,Xin Jin; Nan Zhang; Aditya Mone; Gautam Das,ABSTRACT Many web databases are hidden behind restrictive form-like interfaces whichallow users to execute search queries over the underlying hidden database. While it isimportant to support such search queries; many hidden database owners also want tomaintain a certain level of privacy for aggregate information over their databases; forreasons including business secrets and homeland security. Existing work on aggregatesuppression thwarts the uniform random sampling of a hidden database; but cannot addressrecently proposed attacks which accurately estimate SUM and COUNT queries without theneed to first draw a uniform random sample. In this paper; we consider the problem ofsuppressing SUM and COUNT queries over a hidden database. In particular; we developrandomized generalization; a novel technique which provides rigid aggregate …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,4

DRESS: dimensionality reduction for efficient sequence search,Alexios Kotsifakos; Alexandra Stefan; Vassilis Athitsos; Gautam Das; Panagiotis Papapetrou,Abstract Similarity search in large sequence databases is a problem ubiquitous in a widerange of application domains; including searching biological sequences. In this paper wefocus on protein and DNA data; and we propose a novel approximate method method forspeeding up range queries under the edit distance. Our method works in a filter-and-refinemanner; and its key novelty is a query-sensitive mapping that transforms the original stringspace to a new string space of reduced dimensionality. Specifically; it first identifies the ttmost frequent codewords in the query; and then uses these codewords to convert both thequery and the database to a more compact representation. This is achieved by replacingevery occurrence of each codeword with a new letter and by removing the remaining parts ofthe strings. Using this new representation; our method identifies a set of candidate …,Data mining and knowledge discovery,2015,3

Leveraging history for faster sampling of online social networks,Zhuojie Zhou; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,Abstract With a vast amount of data available on online social networks; how to enableefficient analytics over such data has been an increasingly important research problem.Given the sheer size of such social networks; many existing studies resort to samplingtechniques that draw random nodes from an online social network through its restrictiveweb/API interface. While these studies differ widely in analytics tasks supported andalgorithmic design; almost all of them use the exact same underlying technique of randomwalk-a Markov Chain Monte Carlo based method which iteratively transits from one node toits random neighbor. Random walk fits naturally with this problem because; for most onlinesocial networks; the only query we can issue through the interface is to retrieve theneighbors of a given node (ie; no access to the full graph topology).

Person-Name Parsing for Linking User Web Profiles,G Sujatha Das; Xiang Li; Ang Sun; Hakan Kardes; Xin Wang,Abstract A person-name parser involves the identification of constituent parts of a person'sname. Due to multiple writing styles (" John Smith" versus" Smith; John"); extra information ("John Smith; PhD";" Rev. John Smith"); and country-specific last-name prefixes (" Jean vande Velde"); parsing fullname strings from user profiles on Web 2.0 applications is notstraightforward. To the best of our knowledge; we are the first to address this problemsystematically by proposing machine learning approaches for parsing noisy fullnamestrings. In this paper; we propose several types of features based on token statistics; surface-patterns; and specialized dictionaries and apply them within a sequence modelingframework to learn a fullname parser. In particular; we propose the use of" bucket" featuresbased on (name-token; label) distributions in lieu of" term" features frequently used in …,Proceedings of the 18th International Workshop on Web and Databases,2015,3

Digging deeper into deep web databases by breaking through the Top-k barrier,Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,Abstract: A large number of web databases are only accessible through proprietary form-likeinterfaces which require users to query the system by entering desired values for a fewattributes. A key restriction enforced by such an interface is the top-k output constraint-ie;when there are a large number of matching tuples; only a few (top-k) of them arepreferentially selected and returned by the website; often according to a proprietary rankingfunction. Since most web database owners set k to be a small value; the top-k outputconstraint prevents many interesting third-party (eg; mashup) services from being developedover real-world web databases.

Effects of Capacitor Bank Defects on Harmonic Distortion and Park’s Pattern Analysis in Induction Motors,G Das; S Das; P Purkait; A Dasgupta; M Kumar,Abstract—Properly sized capacitor banks are connected across induction motors for severalreasons including power factor correction; reducing distortions; increasing capacity; etc.Total harmonic distortion (THD) and power factor (PF) are used in such cases to quantify theimprovements obtained through connection of the external capacitor banks. On the otherhand; one of the methods for assessing the motor internal condition is by the use of Park'spattern analysis.

Exact and limit distributions of the largest fitness on correlated fitness landscapes,Kavita Jain; Abhishek Dasgupta; Gayatri Das,Abstract We study the distribution of the maximum of a set of random fitnesses with a fixednumber of mutations in a model of biological evolution. The fitness variables are notindependent and the correlations can be varied via a parameter\ell= 1;\ldots; L. We presentanalytical calculations for the following three solvable cases:(i) one-step mutants witharbitrary\ell;(ii) weakly correlated fitnesses with\ell= L/2;(iii) strongly correlated fitnesseswith\ell= 2. In all these cases; we find that the limit distribution for the maximum fitness is notof the standard Gumbel form.,Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment,2009,3

Time-series similarity problems and well-separated geometric sets,Gautam Das; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Heikki Mannila,Abstract Given a pair of nonidentical complex objects; de ning (and determining) how similarthey are to each other is a nontrivial problem. In data mining applications; one frequentlyneeds to determine the similarity between two time series. We analyze a model of time-series similarity that allows outliers; and di erent scaling functions. We present deterministicand randomized algorithms for computing this notion of similarity. The algorithms are basedon nontrivial tools and methods from computational geometry. In particular; we useproperties of families of well-separated geometric sets. The randomized algorithm hasprovably good performance and also works extremely e ciently in practice.,13th Annual ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry. Association for Computing Machinery,1997,3

Power-balancing styles of Indian managers,GS Das; Chester C Cotton,Emerson's (1962; 1972ab) power-dependence model has had a profound impact on themanner in which power can be viewed in relationships. However; there has been littleempirical work examining Emerson's approach; and even less focused at the individuallevel. The present study takes a psychological approach to Emerson's theory of power anddependency. The study has two objectives. First; it examines the existence and distributionof dominant power-balancing styles among Indian managers. Second; it begins to validatean approach to operationalizing Emerson's conceptualization ofpower and dependency atthe individual level. The study is based on a managerial sample from a cross-section ofIndian industries. Findings provide partial support for the predicted relationships amongpower-balancing styles and other psychological variables. It also provides some support …,Human Relations,1988,3

Bivariate probabilistic modelling of hydro-mechanical properties of vegetated soils,GK Das; B Hazra; A Garg; CWW Ng; N Avani; H Lateh,Abstract Vegetation retains soil suction; which significantly affects the shear strengthcharacteristics of soil and slope stability. However; because of uncertainties (heterogeneousroot distribution; spatial variability) associated with vegetated soil; probabilistic analysis onthe hydro-mechanical properties of vegetated soil is a necessity. Moreover; mechanical(cohesion; c; angle of internal friction; ϕ) as well as hydrological properties (suction; ψ; watercontent; θw) are correlated in nature; and this has a significant effect on the reliability ofgeotechnical structures. However; these studies investigated the dependence structure ofmechanical parameters only. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the dependencestructure of both mechanical (c; ϕ) as well as hydrological (ψ; θw) parameters ofhomogeneously compacted vegetated soil on the basis of measured field data.

Efficient independent set approximation in unit disk graphs,Gautam K Das; Guilherme D da Fonseca; Ramesh K Jallu,Abstract We consider the maximum (weight) independent set problem in unit disk graphs.The high complexity of the existing polynomial-time approximation schemes motivated thedevelopment of faster constant-approximation algorithms. In this article; we present a 2.16-approximation algorithm that runs in O (nlog2 n) time and a 2-approximation algorithm thatruns in O (n2 log n) time for the unweighted version of the problem. In the weighted version;the running times increase by an O (log n) factor. Our algorithms are based on a classic stripdecomposition; but we improve over previous algorithms by efficiently using geometric datastructures. We also propose a PTAS for the unweighted version.,*,2016,2

Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibition: a novel treatment for lowering plasma cholesterol,Gautam Das; Alan Rees,Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is a key element involved in the assembly andsecretion of apolipoprotein B (ApoB) containing lipoproteins. It mediates the transfer oftriglycerides and cholesterol esters from the cytosol to the endoplasmic reticulum containingnascent ApoB during the formation of VLDLs and chylomicrons in the liver and intestinalcells; respectively [1 &]. In abetalipoproteinemia; a rare autosomal recessive disorder;patients have mutations in the MTP gene; which leads to defective and nonfunctional MTPactivity. As a consequence; patients have very low plasma concentrations of triglyceridesand cholesterol and undetectable levels of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and ApoB [2].

Price trade-offs in social media advertising,Milad Eftekhar; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Gautam Das; Nick Koudas,Abstract The prevalence of social media has sparked novel advertising models; vastlydifferent from the traditional keyword based bidding model adopted by search engines. Onesuch model is topic based advertising; popular with micro-blogging sites. Instead of biddingon keywords; the approach is based on bidding on topics; with the winning bid allowed todisseminate messages to users interested in the specific topic.

Aggregate suppression for enterprise search engines,Mingyang Zhang; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,Abstract Many enterprise websites provide search engines to facilitate customer access totheir underlying documents or data. With the web interface of such a search engine; acustomer can specify one or a few keywords that he/she is interested in; and the searchengine returns a list of documents/tuples matching the user-specified keywords; sorted by anoften-proprietary scoring function. It was traditionally believed that; because of its highly-restrictive interface (ie; keyword search only; no SQL-style queries); such a search engineserves its purpose of answering individual keyword-search queries without disclosing big-picture aggregates over the data which; as we shall show in the paper; may incur significantprivacy concerns to the enterprise.

Low Temperature Sensitization on the Orthogonal Surfaces of Prior Deformed AISI 304LN and Aged at 673 K to 873 K (400° C to 600° C),Raghuvir Singh; S Ghosh Chowdhury; Gautam Das; PK Singh; I Chattoraj,This study investigates the sensitization behavior of AISI 304LN deformed previously by coldrolling (CR) to 5 pct to 25 pct reduction in thickness and aged at 673 K to 873 K (400° C to600° C). The emphasis was on revealing the degree of sensitization (DOS) resulting fromlow-temperature sensitization (LTS) on the orthogonal surfaces and correlation thereof withthe changes in various metallurgical properties caused by cold rolling. It was found that theDOS differs among the orthogonal surfaces such as the rolling surface (RS); transversesurface (TS); and cross transverse surface (CTS). RS showed lower DOS compared withCTS and TS. The differences in the DOS were attributed to the combined effect ofdeformation-induced martensite (DIM); grain size; and slip band formation. A deformation of5 pct was critical to the susceptibility of AISI 304LN to intergranular (IGC) and …,Metallurgical and Materials Transactions A,2012,2

RAE; B 21 82] betweenJune 1932 and May 1933; two additional species of Anopheles; A. gigas Giles; and A.splendidus Koidz.; were taken; but no larvae of these or of A. culicifacies Giles; were found.Of 1; 530 females dissected; the only ones infected were 5.56 per cent. of 934 of A. minimusTheo. February; March and April were the only months in which no infections wereobserved. Anti-larval measures; which were carried out from July 1932 within a radius of halfa mile round Kachugaon; consisted of oiling all permanent breeding-places once a weekand treating temporary breeding-places; rice-fields and the edges of streams with Parisgreen. Vegetation growing near dwellings was also removed to reduce the shelter for adultmosquitos. The total weekly catch of mosquitos at four stations fell from 276 in June 1932 …,Records of the Malaria Survey of India,1933,2
Designing Fair Ranking Schemes,Abolfazl Asudehy; HV Jagadishy; Julia Stoyanovichz; Gautam Das,Abstract: Items from a database are often ranked based on a combination of multiple criteria.Often; a user may have flexibility to accept combinations that weight these criteria differently;within limits. On the other hand; this choice of weights can greatly affect the fairness of theranking produced. In this paper; we develop a system that helps users choose criterionweights that lead to greater fairness. We consider ranking functions that compute the scoreof each item as a weighted sum of (numeric) attribute values; and then sort items on theirscore. Each ranking function can then be expressed as a vector of weights; or a point in amulti-dimensional space. For a broad range of fairness criteria; we show how to efficientlyidentify regions in this space that satisfy these criteria. Using this identification; our system isable to tell users whether their proposed ranking function satisfies the desired fairness …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.09752,2017,1
Addressing the barriers related with opioid therapy for management of chronic pain in India,Gur Prasad Dureja; Paramanand N Jain; Muralidhar Joshi; Ashok Saxena; Gautam Das; Jaishid Ahdal; Prashant Narang,India has a high prevalence of chronic disorders which may be associated with persistentpain. Despite the availability of multiple treatment options; chronic pain is largely untreatedand contributes to disability and mortality. Medical consumption of opioids remains low dueto various barriers that prevent access to opioids for patients and healthcare practitioners.Stringent regulatory provisions outlined in the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic SubstancesAct (1985) have been major deterrents to adequate opioid use. Although multipleamendments to the act have ensured ease of opioid access for medicinal purposes;concerns such as lack of awareness and prescribing practices and attitudes ofphysicians/patients still need to be addressed. This review aims to identify these barriersand suggest recommendations to overcome them.,*,2017,1
Dual feed MIMO cylindrical dielectric resonator antenna with high isolation,Gourab Das; Anand Sharma; Ravi Kumar Gangwar,Abstract A cylindrical dielectric resonator antenna (CDRA) for multiple-input multiple-output(MIMO) applications is examined in this article. Proposed MIMO radiator achieves highisolation by generating orthogonal modes in CDRA with the help of dual feeding techniques;that is; aperture coupling (port-1) and coplanar waveguide (port-2) techniques. Thefractional bandwidth for both port-1 and port-2 is 11.5%(4.9–5.5 GHz). The isolation inoperating band between port-1 and port-2 exceed more than 32dB. For validating theoptimized simulated results; the archetype of proposed MIMO antenna is fabricated andtested. The diversity performance of proposed structure is also examined and experimentallyverified. The proposed radiator is found appropriate for 5.2 GHz WLAN application.,Microwave and Optical Technology Letters,2017,1
Revisiting the Arthashastra: An approach to emotional intelligence,Amrita Mohanty; Ganesh Prasad Das,Abstract The concept of emotional intelligence is a well known behavioral construct amongstudents; teachers; and researchers in the area of organizational behavior and psychologythroughout the world. Still; it is imperative to redefine the different aspects of emotionalintelligence in the context of the prevailing aggressive global atmosphere. The achievementand failure of a company chiefly depends upon the productive and effective handling ofresources available within the organization. Resources are categorized into two like: humanand non-human. Successful and productive uses of non-human resources are possible onlythrough highly motivated and committed human beings. Motivation and commitment amongthe work force are shaped and injected through the dynamic leadership of managers. One ofthe vital aspects of effective leadership is to develop the ability to perceive emotions …,Prabandhan: Indian Journal of Management,2017,1

Density Based Clustering over Location Based Services,Md Farhadur Rahman; Weimo Liu; Saad Bin Suhaim; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,Location Based Services (LBS) have become extremely popular over the past decade;being used on a daily basis by millions of users. Instances of real-world LBS range frommapping services (eg; Google Maps) to lifestyle recommendations (eg; Yelp) to real-estatesearch (eg; Redfin). In general; an LBS provides a public (often web-based) search interfaceover its backend database (of tuples with 2D geolocations); taking as input a 2D query pointand returning k tuples in the database that are closest to the query point; where k is usually asmall constant such as 20 or 50. Such a public interface is often called a k-Nearest-Neighbor; ie; kNN; interface. In this paper; we consider a novel problem of enabling densitybased clustering over the backend database of an LBS using nothing but limited access tothe kNN interface provided by the LBS. Specifically; a key limit enforced by most real …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on,2017,1
A Probabilistic Framework for Estimating Pairwise Distances Through Crowdsourcing.,Habibur Rahman; Senjuti Basu Roy; Gautam Das,ABSTRACT Estimating all pairs of distances among a set of objects has wide applicability invarious computational problems in databases; machine learning; and statistics. This workpresents a probabilistic framework for estimating all pair distances through crowdsourcing;where the human workers are involved to provide distance between some object pairs.Since the workers are subject to error; their responses are considered with a probabilisticinterpretation. In particular; the framework comprises of three problems:(1) Given multiplefeedback on an object pair; how do we combine and aggregate those feedback and create aprobability distribution of the distance?(2) Since the number of possible pairs is quadratic inthe number of objects; how do we estimate; from the known feedback for a small numbers ofobject pairs; the unknown distances among all other object pairs?

Hardness of Liar's Domination on Unit Disk Graphs,Ramesh K Jallu; Gautam K Das,Abstract: A unit disk graph is the intersection graph of a set of unit diameter disks in theplane. In this paper we consider liar's domination problem on unit disk graphs; a variant ofdominating set problem. We call this problem as {\it Euclidean liar's domination problem}. Inthe Euclidean liar's domination problem; a set ${\cal P}=\{p_1; p_2;\ldots; p_n\} $ of $ n $points (disk centers) are given in the Euclidean plane. For $ p\in {\cal P} $; $ N [p] $ is asubset of ${\cal P} $ such that for any $ q\in N [p] $; the Euclidean distance between $ p $and $ q $ is less than or equal to 1; ie; the corresponding unit diameter disks intersect. Theobjective of the Euclidean liar's domination problem is to find a subset $ D\;(\subseteq {\calP}) $ of minimum size having the following properties:(i) $| N [p_i]\cap D|\geq 2$ for $1\leqi\leq n $; and (ii) $|(N [p_i]\cup N [p_j])\cap D|\geq 3$ for $ i\neq j; 1\leq i; j\leq n $.

Ad-wire: Add-on for web item reviewing system,Rajeshkumar Kannapalli; Azade Nazi; Mahashweta Das; Gautam Das,Abstract Over the past few decades as purchasing options moved online; the widespreaduse and popularity of online review sites has simultaneously increased. In spite of the factthat a huge extent of buying choices today are driven by numeric scores (eg; rating aproduct); detailed reviews play an important role for activities like purchasing an expensiveDSLR camera. Since writing a detailed review for an item is usually time-consuming; thenumber of reviews available in the Web is far from many. In this paper; we build a system AD-WIRE that given a user and an item; our system identifies the top-k meaningful tags to helpher review the item easily. AD-WIRE allows a user to compose her review by quicklyselecting from among the set of returned tags or writes her own review.

Beyond itemsets: mining frequent featuresets over structured items,Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Habibur Rahman; Sofiane Abbar; Gautam Das,Abstract We assume a dataset of transactions generated by a set of users over structureditems where each item could be described through a set of features. In this paper; we areinterested in identifying the frequent featuresets (set of features) by mining item transactions.For example; in a news website; items correspond to news articles; the features are thenamed-entities/topics in the articles and an item transaction would be the set of news articlesread by a user within the same session. We show that mining frequent featuresets overstructured item transactions is a novel problem and show that straightforward extensions ofexisting frequent itemset mining techniques provide unsatisfactory results. This is due to thefact that while users are drawn to each item in the transaction due to a subset of its features;the transaction by itself does not provide any information about such underlying preferred …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,1
Performance simulation of a MRPC-based PET Imaging System,A Roy; A Banerjee; S Biswas; S Chattopadhyay; G Das; S Saha,Abstract The less expensive and high resolution Multi-gap Resistive Plate Chamber (MRPC)opens up a new possibility to find an efficient alternative detector for the Time of Flight (TOF)based Positron Emission Tomography; where the sensitivity of the system depends largelyon the time resolution of the detector. In a layered structure; suitable converters can be usedto increase the photon detection efficiency. In this work; we perform a detailed GEANT4simulation to optimize the converter thickness towards improving the efficiency of photonconversion. A Monte Carlo based procedure has been developed to simulate the timeresolution of the MRPC-based system; making it possible to simulate its response for PETimaging application. The results of the test of a six-gap MRPC; operating in avalanchemode; with 22 Na source have been discussed.,Journal of Instrumentation,2014,1

Sacroiliac joint arthropathy and low back pain,K Sardar; G Das; V Kapoor; P Mahta; Sabina Yeasmeen; Raihan Uddin,Sacroiliac (SI) joint dysfunction is understood by clinicians as one of many causes of thegeneral category of low back pain. SI joint dysfunction may wholly be responsible for the lowback pain syndrome and/or may be contributory to low back pain in concern with otherpathology of the lumbar spine. It is often an overlooked and underappreciated diagnosis.Sacroiliac (SI) joint pain is a challenging condition affecting15% to 25% of patients with axiallow back pain; for which thereis no standard longterm treatment. Recent studies havedemonstrated that historical and physical examination findings and radiologicalimaging areinsufficient to diagnose SI joint pain. The mostcommonly used method to diagnose the SIjoint as a pain generator is with small-volume local anesthetic blocks; although the validityofthis practice remains unproven.,Journal of the Bangladesh Society of Anaesthesiologists,2014,1

Use of monoclonal antibodies for proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 inhibition: issues with efficacy; tolerability and safety,Gautam Das; Alan Rees,The greater the lowering of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C); the greater the benefit in terms ofcoronary heart disease (CHD) risk reduction [1]. The mainstay of lipid-lowering therapypresently is inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase that is statin therapy;which reduces LDL-C by upregulation of the expression of the LDL receptor. The recognitionof the central role of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) in the recycling ofthe LDL receptor and the fact that gain of function mutations at this locus results in thefamilial hypercholesterolemia phenotype has focussed on the inhibition of PCSK9 activity asa potential therapeutic strategy to further lower LDL-C concentrations [2 &&].

Impact of water quality on the changing environmental scenario of Sunderbans,Gautam Kumar Das,Abstract: Changes in the local hydrology in the estuarine river waters of Sunderbans are themost important contributory factors attributable to the changing scenario of mangroveecosystems. Changes in river courses impede fresh water flow towards Sunderbans. Allthese changes as a result of regional and global processes and climatic changes cause thechanges in the salinity; pH; dissolved oxygen; temperature and all other changes in thephysico-chemical parameters in the brackish waters of the Sunderbans. Mangrovedistribution is limited worldwide depending principally on temperature and salinity variationsof the estuarine river waters.,Reason. Kalyani Govt. Engineering College XI,2012,1

Analysis on Static Voltage Stability Using SVC; STATCOM; TCSC & UPFC,SM Padmaja; G Tulasiram Das,Abstract Modern electric power utilities are facing many challenges due to ever increasingcomplexity in their operation and structure. One problem that received wide attention isvoltage instability. One of the major causes of voltage instability in the power system is withits reactive power limit. Voltage instability is the cause of the system voltage collapse; inwhich the power system voltage decays to a level; from which point; it is unable to recover.Voltage collapse may lead to partial or full power interruption in the system. Providingadequate reactive power support at the appropriate location solves voltage instabilityproblems. Improving the systems reactive power handling capacity with Flexible ACTransmission System (FACTS) devices is one remedy for prevention of the voltage instabilityand voltage collapse. In this paper the effect of four FACTS controllers SVC; STATCOM …,*,2010,1
Estimation of Milk Urea Level as a Potential Tool for Dairy Herd Management,Biswajit Roy; Sudipta Ghosh; KKS Baghel; Giridhari Das; Malay Kr Mandal; S Koley,Increased genetic potential for milk production has been associated with a decline in fertilityof lactating diary cows. Strategies for meeting the nutritional requirements of high producingcows have necessarily changed in conjunction with genetic gains. Increasing proteinconcentration of the diet of lactating dairy cows can often increase milk production. However;efficiency of utilization of dietary protein for milk production decreased as more protein isoffered. In an effort to sustain milk production during early lactation; dairy producers oftenincrease nutrient density of dairy cows diets to compensate for suboptimal intakes. Thissituation may lead to protein intakes in excess of recommendation or requirement. Protein isan expensive ingredient of dairy cattle feeds and thus; overfeeding of protein could be costlyto producers. Although; high dietary protein stimulates milk production; increased protein …,Serva Manav Vikas Samiti-Smvs’ Dairy Year Book 2010-Farm management & diseases,2010,1

Placement and range assignment in power-aware radio networks,Goutam Kumar Das,Due to the extraordinary growth of demand in mobile communication facility; design ofefficient systems for providing specialized services has become an important issue inwireless mobility research. Broadly speaking; there are two major models for wirelessnetworking: single-hop and multi-hop. The single-hop model [110] is based on the cellularnetwork; and it provides one-hop wireless connectivity between the host and the staticnodes known as base stations. single-hop networks rely on a fixed backbone infrastructurethat interconnects all the base stations by high speed wired links. On the other hand; themulti-hop model requires neither fixed wired infrastructure nor predeterminedinterconnectivity [83]. Two main examples where the multi-hop model is adopted; are ad hocnetwork and sensor network [111]. Ad hoc wireless networking is a technology that …,*,2008,1

Significance of Role Innovation in Defining Good Work,GS Das,Work is integral to remain alive. It is really difficult to come across any living organism whichdoes not work. Especially in the case of human beings work had been an important aspectof identity from the recorded history of human civilisation. However; through the ages ourattitude; orientation and values towards work have gone through perceptiblemetamorphosis. Human beings have perceived and evaluated and attached meaning towork in many different ways. In this regard; differences can be observed at macro level?across cultures; communities; or even nationalities. Interestingly; difference also can beobserved at micro/individual level too. For example; in a country like India working is aprimary requirement for survival for a large section of the society. In India; working isconsidered as synonymous of working for living.

Defense strategies of tea towards foliar pathogens,BN Chakraborty; S Rana; S Das; G Das; R Som; S Datta; U Chakraborty,Tea forms the backbone of the economy of North-East India. Foliar diseases drasticallyreduce the quality and quantity of tea production. Besides being perennial; it is likely that thetea plant in the course of its adjustment to varying environments; has also evolved a veryeffective defense mechanism which successfully wards off most of the fungal pathogens(Chakraborty et. al 1995). The biochemical mechanisms responsible for containment offungal pathogens in the resistant interactions are undoubtedly multifold. Available evidencealso indicates that resistance to disease in many cases is the result of activation of morethan one biochemical defense mechanism (Ebel and Grisebach; 1988). Phytoalexinproduction is known to be one of the conferral mechanisms of disease resistance in severalplants (Hammerschmidt; 1999).,Stress Biology. New Delhi: Narosa Publishing House,2005,1
Role of corrosion product on the protectiveness of corrosion layers for microalloyed pipeline steel,GS Das; AS Khanna,Corrosion behavior of API grade microalloyed pipeline steel was studied in CO2 saturateddistilled water using weight loss technique. The protectiveness of corrosion layers varieswith temperature. The experimental results show that corrosion layers are composed of aninsoluble corrosion product of iron carbonate (FeCO3) which is partially protective (30–60°C); or highly protective (90–120° C) and very severe corrosive between (60–90° C). At thelower temperatures; the metal is partially protected but as the temperature increases; theprotectiveness completely diminishes due to non-uniform and porous nature of the corrosionlayer. Beyond 90° C; the formation of FeCO3 film predominates on the steel surface; which isdense and more adherent and hence the metal surface is completely protected from furthercorrosion. The corrosion products formed were analyzed by scanning electron …,Journal of Metallurgy and Materials Science,2005,1

But LVDT measured depth can not able toestimate actual indented depth due to pile-up/sink-in surrounding the indentation profile. Toestablish a relationship between the pile-up/sink-in and the deviation of actual indentationdiameters; a suitable and practical parameter; yield ratio (YR); is considered. It is found thatfor higher pile-up/sink-in corresponding diameters and the value of YR is higher.

A lower bound for approximating the geometric minimum weight matching,Gautam Das; Michiel Smid,Abstract Given a set S of 2n points in R d; a perfect matching of S is a set of n edges suchthat each point of S is a vertex of exactly one edge. The weight of a perfect matching is thesum of the Euclidean lengths of all edges. Rao and Smith have recently shown that there isa constant r> 1; that only depends on the dimension d; such that a perfect matching whoseweight is less than or equal to r times the weight of a minimum weight perfect matching canbe computed in O (n log n) time. We show that this algorithm is optimal in the algebraiccomputation tree model.,Information processing letters,2000,1

Biomolecular and physiological studies on hydration-dehydration seed invigoration pretreatment: an attempt to overcome constraints of wet seeding in rice,S Sen-Mandi; S Nandi; G Das; S Chakraborti,Abstract Hydration-dehydration seed pretreatment provided an improvement over theconventional practice of sowing pregerminated seeds. This was achieved by halting thewetting phase just before root emergence; thereby preventing desiccation of the young root.These seeds appeared to exhibit enhanced seedling establishment. Studies with 1-and 2-yr-old rice seeds having 80 and 60% viability; respectively; showed that 15 h of hydration;followed by dehydration in a mild draft of warm air could exploit maximum benefits from thehydration-dehydration pretreatment. The 15-h pretreatment restored DNA integrity which islargely impaired during postharvest seed storage.

Effect of insulin on serum lipids in relation to nutritional status in diabetics,GP Das; B Mandal; P Ghosh; CR Maity,Abstract Serum levels of cholesterol; triglyceride; free fatty acid (FFA) and high densitylipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were studied in 10 undernourished and 10 better nourisheddiabetic patients at different periods of insulin treatment and in non-diabetic controls. Serumconcentrations of cholesterol; triglyceride and FFA were significantly higher in untreateddiabetic patients than in control but the elevated lipid levels gradually shifted towards normalon insulin treatment. The HDL cholesterol; on the other hand; was significantly lower inuntreated diabetic subjects than those in controls and the HDL cholesterol also graduallymodified on insulin therapy. However; the improvement of all the lipid parameters on insulintreatment was somewhat delayed in undernourished compared to those of better nourisheddiabetics.

Power-Balance Style: An Approach to Measurement,GS Das,The concept'power'has been dealt with by many authors in different ways. The essence ofpower concept is that it is a relational one. A person cannot have power in isolation: it has tobe in relationship to some other person or collectivity. The importance of relational aspect ofpower has been specially developed in Emerson's study (1962) on the importance ofdependency relationships in the total power constellation. Emerson suggests that powerresides" implicity in others' dependency"; in other words" the parties in power relationshipare tied to each other by mutual dependency". The theory has attracted considerableattention; mainly of the sociologists and has been placed in the works of Blau (1964); Secordand Backman (1964); Thompson (1967); Heskett; Stern and Beier (1970) and Thompsonand Van Houten (1970) in examining inter-unit or inter organisational dependency …,Indian Journal of Industrial Relations,1982,1

On the Choice of Optimum Gain for Linear Feedback Control Systems,V Seshadri; GC Das,ABSTRACT The design of a linear feedback control system normally implies a compromisechoice of loop gain between the conflicting requirements of (a) high gain for good steady-state accuracy and bandwidth; and (b) low gain for satisfactory stability and damping. Theoptimum gain would be that which leads to a system with the best possible step-response asindicated by the minimization of a suitably chosen index of optimization. The paper presentsthe results of an attempt to develop a frequency-domain approach to the direct determinationof optimum gain for linear systems. A figure of merit for linear systems in the form: gm. sin φmv− 1m is suggested; where gm; φm; Vm are respectively the gain-margin; the phase-margin and the frequency-margin (ωcp/ωcg) for the system.

Foreign Trade and Economic Growth of Central Africa,GS Das,Foreign trade as a transmitter of growth from the developed to the underdeveloped countriesis-looked upon with some doubts today. An attempt is made below to analyse the impact offoreign trade on the economic growth of Central Africa-since the war. Sweeping political andeconomic changes have occurred in the three Central African territories in the post-warperiod. Traditionally these economics; with the exception of Nyasaland; are exporteconomics. Revenue derived from the export of a few agricultural and mineral productsconstitute a high proportion of the national income. And growth came primarily through theexpansion of their export trade. For example; the two Rhodesias blessed with someagricultural and mineral potential could develop fairly rapidly.

Depth resolved chemical speciation of a superlattice structure,Gangadhar Das; AG Karydas; Haranath Ghosh; M Czyzycki; A Migliori; AK Sinha; MK Tiwari,Abstract: We report results of simultaneous x-ray reflectivity and grazing incidence x-rayfluorescence measurements in combination with x-ray standing wave assisted depthresolved near edge x-ray absorption measurements to reveal new insights on chemicalspeciation of W in a W-B4C superlattice structure. Interestingly; our results show existence ofvarious unusual electronic states for the W atoms especially those sitting at the surface andinterface boundary of a thin film medium as compared to that of the bulk. These observationsare found to be consistent with the results obtained using first principles calculations. Unlikethe conventional x-ray absorption measurements the present approach has an advantagethat it permits the determination of depth resolved chemical nature of an element in the thinlayered materials at atomic length scale resolutions.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.04097,2017,*
Assisting Service Providers In Peer-to-peer Marketplaces: Maximizing Gain Over Flexible Attributes,Abolfazl Asudeh; Azade Nazi; Nick Koudas; Gautam Das,Abstract: Peer to peer marketplaces such as AirBnB enable transactional exchange ofservices directly between people. In such platforms; those providing a service (hosts inAirBnB) are faced with various choices. For example in AirBnB; although some amenities ina property (attributes of the property) are fixed; others are relatively flexible and can beprovided without significant effort. Providing an amenity is usually associated with a cost.Naturally different sets of amenities may have a different``gains''(monetary or otherwise) fora host. Consequently; given a limited budget; deciding which amenities (attributes) to offer ischallenging.

Vitamin D and type 2 diabetes,Gautam Das,Abstract In recent times there has been a growing interest in the non-classical effects ofvitamin D as receptors for vitamin D have been abundantly identified in tissues other thanbone; gut and kidneys. Strong evidence has emerged that vitamin D alters glucosemetabolism through its action on synthesis and transport of insulin and its signallingpathways; and it also has a widespread role in regulating insulin sensitivity and resistance.Obese people have been found to have lower stores of vitamin D which predispose them toinflammation and insulin resistance; leading to alteration in glucose homeostasis and thedevelopment of type 2 diabetes. Results from several cross-sectional and longitudinalstudies have established a potential link between vitamin D status and type 2 diabetes butthe cause–effect relationship still remains an open issue for intense debate.

Sediment Composition,Gautam Kumar Das,Abstract Thakuran River sediments are typically estuarine. Lithogenic constituents aredominant with about 85–90% in bulk and biogenic components constitute the rest (10–15%).Quartz; feldspars; mica; lithic fragments and some heavy minerals are the main terrigenousconstituents. Secondary overgrowth of quartz with multiple rims of inclusions suggests theirderivation from sedimentary rocks of different cycles of sedimentation. The heavy mineralassemblage in the sediments leads to the conclusion that the sediments have been derivedfrom the acidic igneous rocks of the Himalayas in the north and the metamorphic rocks of thePrecambrian shields of the west and north-west of Bengal Basin. The benthic foraminiferalassemblage indicates a shallow-water; moderate-to-low saline environment.,*,2017,*
Mangroves Swamp and Tidal-Marsh Sedimentation,Gautam Kumar Das,Abstract The Thakuran drainage basin is a unique example of a intensely proliferatingmangrove ecosystem; and it contains the richest mangrove repository of the Sunderbans.Intertidal zones of newly developed point bars and mid-channel bars besides areas ofnatural levees and river flood plains are the suitable sites for mangrove flora in the ThakuranBasin. The morphodynamics of the Thakuran tidal river; situated in a tropical meso-macrotidal flow regime; play a vital role in the sedimentation pattern of the tidal marsh andalso in changing the mangrove flora of the region. The native fauna of silty marsh sedimentsoften cause changes in tidal currents over the marshes and create a baffling effect againstwaves and currents. Construction of earthen dams and land reclamation on both banks ofthe Thakuran River have an adverse effect on the growth of tidal-marsh vegetation.,*,2017,*
Sediment Texture,Gautam Kumar Das,Abstract Granulometric studies of sediment samples from different geomorphic units (eg mid-channel bars or flood-tidal delta; river mouth bars or ebb-tidal deltas; point bars; swashplatforms; wash-over flats and riverbanks (levee) of the Thakuran basin have revealed theprevailing hydrodynamic condition at the time of their deposition. A coarsening of graphicmean size (MZ); betterment of sorting (σ 1) and negative to positive skewness (SK 1) havebeen noticed; progressively from the seaward point and in the landward direction. Variationsof these textural parameters are related to decreasing energy levels in the same direction. Abipartite-granulometric model of sedimentation; which has a sand-to-mud transition from theseaward point of the tidal creek and in the landward direction; has been discerned. This is incontrast to a tripartite-granulometric model typical of estuaries.,*,2017,*
Mudflats and Tidal Creek Sedimentation,Gautam Kumar Das,Abstract The Thakuran River is truly a major tidal creek in the low-lying; tropical coastalplains of the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. It is fed by to-and-fro-moving flood and ebb flowswithout any headwater discharge. The Thakuran River basin is intersected by numerouscreeks and characterised by the mudflats on the river margins as well as in the riverbed.Lateral sedimentation takes place on meandering tidal creeks and gullies; whereas verticalsedimentation is found in the mudflats. Morphological features like mud ridges; mudmicrodelta; mud pellets; and mud lumps are recognised in their relationships to creeksedimentation. Depositional features typical of tidal environment like mud couplets; tidalbedding and tidal bundles have been recognised.

Study of behavioural pattern of these organisms throughbioturbation structures helps geologists in deciphering the environmental conditionsprevalent during the intervening period of deposition of soft sediments and their lithification.They may be of lesser magnitude; but the processes of bioturbation have the potential toalter depositional sequences and sediment chemistry through the process of exhumationand subsurface mixing of sediments; as evidenced in cases of burrows in the intertidalmudflats of the Thakuran River.,*,2017,*
Thakuran Drainage Basin,Gautam Kumar Das,Abstract The most conspicuous geomorphic feature of the Sunderbans is a low; alluvial plainintersected by an intricate network of tidal rivers; creeks; estuaries and minor tidal-watercourses. The Thakuran River is one of the most important tidal rivers of a meso-macrotidalregime having no perennial freshwater supply; and it forms a drainage basin covering about900 km 2 in area. The meandering and bifurcating channel systems of the Thakuran Basinhave given rise to the formations of various islands mainly by the settling down of particleson the river bed and also by being cutting off from the mainland due to the bifurcation ofchannels. Construction of embankments to prevent severe bank erosion has resulted in thechanging courses of the Thakuran River and the hindrance to growth of mangroves along itsriver banks.,*,2017,*
Geomorphic Environments,Gautam Kumar Das,Abstract The most recognisable geomorphic environments of the Thakuran Basin are riversystems of fluvial; estuarine and tidal nature; tidal creek systems and sandy delta beaches.The roles played by these dynamic agencies have given rise to various erosional andaccretional features throughout the drainage basin. Natural levees; point bars; mid-channelbars; swash platforms; wash-over flats and an ebb-tidal delta are some of the noteworthygeomorphic features present in the area. Severe bank erosion is observed in areas of highwave action near the mouth of the Thakuran River. Point bars are generally fulcate tocrescentic in shape with Epsilon Cross Stratification. Depending upon the distance from thesea; the mid-channel bars show varying composition from mud to sand. Both banks of theThakuran River exhibit fringing mangrove vegetation.

Climate and Hydrography,Gautam Kumar Das,Abstract The Thakuran Basin is an ideal example of a region with a tropical climate with hot;rainy and humid summers and dry winters. The monsoon is normally characterised by thepresence of cyclonic storms which bring large-scale littoral drift and coastal modifications.The Thakuran River belongs to a meso-macrotidal regime with semidiurnal tides for its entire80 km length. Separation of flood and ebb channels in the river basin is controlled by theprinciple of Coriolis force. Time-velocity asymmetry of the tidal current is appreciable andmarked by bedform configurations related to flood and ebb channels.,*,2017,*

Studies on the Evaluation of the Half-sib Progenies to Identify the Prepotency of the Mother Clones of Hevea brasiliensis in Meghalaya.,U Chandra; MJ Reju; RP Singh; G Das; D Panda; KK Mydin,Meghalaya being one of the potential areas of rubber cultivation in North-East India offerspromise of economic stability for the growers of this region by way of adopting rubbercultivation. Due to the area expansion under rubber in the state the dependency on thetraditional clones has increased significantly but growers do not have so many options ofchoosing the potential clones suitable for the region. Therefore; it has now becomeimportant to identify pre-potent clones through breeding programmes viz. half-sib progenyevaluation trials; full-sib progeny evaluation trials; poly-cross progeny evaluation trials etc.The rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis Wiil. ex Adr. de Juss. MuellArg.) is preferentially a crosspollinated crop with a long generative and testing or breeding cycle.

The Euclidean k-Supplier Problem in,Manjanna Basappa; Ramesh K Jallu; Gautam K Das; Subhas C Nandy,Abstract In this paper; we consider k-supplier problem in. Here; two sets of points PP and QQare given. The objective is to choose a subset Q_ opt ⊆ QQ opt⊆ Q of size at most k suchthat congruent disks of minimum radius centered at the points in Q_ opt Q opt cover all thepoints of P P. We propose a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm for the k-supplierproblem that produces a 2-factor approximation result. For| P|= n| P|= n and| Q|= m| Q|= m;the worst case running time of the algorithm is O (6^ k (n+ m)\log (mn)) O (6 k (n+ m) log(mn)); which is an exponential function of the parameter k.

Companies which cannot produce adequate levels ofinnovation outputs are likely to lose their competitiveness. Small and medium sizeenterprises (SMEs) which constitute a large part of enterprises face more diverse set ofobstacles than larger enterprises. Thus; in many countries public policies that encourageinnovation are encountered. In this study; an approach is proposed to design public policiesbased on innovation profiles of SMEs. The approach would lead to different strategicroadmaps and public support tools designed for SMEs with different innovative profiles. Thatwould increase the contribution of SMEs to the country's overall technological developmentprocess and international competitiveness.,Ege Akademik Bakis,2016,*

Ozone Nucleolysis,Gautam Das,ABSTRACT Low back pain; with or without radiation to leg; is very common. Disk prolapsewith compression and/or inflammation of nerve root is one of the common reasons for thiscondition. When conservative management fails; surgery is one of the important treatmentmodality for this condition. But; complications of conventional surgery are very high and thus;scientists were in search of some safer treatment modalities. Ozone is a highly reactiveunstable molecule which was found to denature disk glycoprotein molecule. Thus;osmolality of nucleus pulposus is reduced and it gets dehydrated. Thus; disk is reduced insize and decompresses nerve root. Ozone also has anti-inflammatory effect and thus;reduces nerve root inflammation too.

HDBSCAN: Density based Clustering over Location Based Services,Md Farhadur Rahman; Weimo Liu; Saad Bin Suhaim; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,Abstract: Location Based Services (LBS) have become extremely popular and used bymillions of users. Popular LBS run the entire gamut from mapping services (such as GoogleMaps) to restaurants (such as Yelp) and real-estate (such as Redfin). The public queryinterfaces of LBS can be abstractly modeled as a kNN interface over a database of twodimensional points: given an arbitrary query point; the system returns the k points in thedatabase that are nearest to the query point. Often; k is set to a small value such as 20 or 50.In this paper; we consider the novel problem of enabling density based clustering over anLBS with only a limited; kNN query interface. Due to the query rate limits imposed by LBS;even retrieving every tuple once is infeasible. Hence; we seek to construct a clusterassignment function f (.) by issuing a small number of kNN queries; such that for any …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1602.03730,2016,*

Knowledge about theoxidation states of uranium in its oxides is very important to understand their solubilitybehavior; migration as well as nuclear fuel reprocessing. Since uranium compounds areprone to surface oxidation; a technique involving direct measurement of solid samples forsuch purpose is preferred. Normally uranium oxidation states in its compounds aredetermined by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) or X-ray Absorption Near EdgeStructure (XANES). An ideal technique for radioactive nuclear materials should require avery small amount of sample and produce small amount of analytical waste.

In thenineteenth century and early part of twentieth century; it was believed by neuroscientist that theadult mammalian central nervous system (CNS); once developed in the intrauterine life and earlychildhood; was stable and no change occurs subsequently. This dogma in neurology was challengedby Liu and Chambers; who in mid-1950s first discovered the intraspinal axonal sprouting followinghemipyramidotomy in monkeys (1958).

Cardiovascular outcome trials in type 2 diabetes: what have we learned from the past and present?,Gautam Das,Abstract There is a wealth of epidemiological data which shows that type 2 diabetessignificantly increase the risk of cardiovascular events. The evidence from earlier trials havedemonstrated that improvement in glycated haemoglobin will reduce the risk of microvascular disease but there is lack of robust evidence to suggest whether improvement inglycaemic control will have similar beneficial outcomes on macro vascular disease. In thelast few years there have been a paradigm shift by which cardiovascular trials relating totherapy in type 2 diabetes are being conducted as every new drug needs to demonstratecardiovascular safety as per the requirements set by several health regulatory authorities.This has led to alteration in study designs; duration for which they are conducted and endpoints which are being assessed.

Structured analytics in social media,Mahashweta Das; Gautam Das,Abstract The rise of social media has turned the Web into an online community wherepeople connect; communicate; and collaborate with each other. Structured analytics insocial media is the process of discovering the structure of the relationships emerging fromthis social media use. It focuses on identifying the users involved; the activities theyundertake; the actions they perform; and the items (eg; movies; restaurants; blogs; etc.) theycreate and interact with. There are two key challenges facing these tasks: how to organizeand model social media content; which is often unstructured in its raw form; in order toemploy structured analytics on it; and how to employ analytics algorithms to capture bothexplicit link-based relationships and implicit behavior-based relationships.

Principled Optimization Frameworks for Query Reformulation of Database Queries,Gautam Das,Abstract Traditional databases have traditionally supported the Boolean retrieval model;where a query returns all tuples that match the selection conditions specified--no more andno less. Such a query model is often inconvenient for naive users conducting searches thatare often exploratory in nature; since the user may not have a complete idea; or a firmopinion of what she may be looking for. This is especially relevant in the context of the DeepWeb; which offers a plethora of searchable data sources such as electronic products;transportation choices; apparel; investment options; etc. Users often encounter two types ofproblems:(a) they may under-specify the items of interest; and find too many items satisfyingthe given conditions (the many answers problem); or (b) they may over-specify the items ofinterest; and find no item in the source satisfying all the provided conditions (the empty …,Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Exploratory Search in Databases and the Web,2015,*

Substrate Soils,Gautam Kumar Das,Abstract The humic and acid sulphate soils of Sunderbans are basically saline micaceousdeltaic alluvium which is ideal for the growth of luxuriant mangrove forest. Substrate soilshave a major impact on mangrove nutrition and growth. High nutrient concentration and lowsalinity of substrate soils produce rapid growth of mangroves in Sunderbans. On the basis ofsalt concentrations present; soils of Sunderbans are classified into saline soil; saline–alkalisoil; non-saline alkali soil and degraded saline-alkali soils. Most of the mangrove speciesprefer low saline substratum. The water holding capacity and process of aeration are poor inthe substrate soils of different geomorphic units of Sunderbans.,*,2015,*
River Systems and Tidal Courses,Gautam Kumar Das,Abstract The Sunderbans are drained by numerous interconnected rivulets; tidal creeks orinlets and estuaries. The tides and waves in these water bodies coupled with othergeological and tectonic processes are responsible for significant morpho-dynamic changesin the macrotidal coastline. Extensive blanket of flood plain deposit; low ridges of naturallevees; channel bars associated with various environmentally significant sedimentarystructures characterise the lower estuarine zone. The other conspicuous landforms aremudflats; back swamps; salt marshes; tidal creeks with mangrove; coastal dunes; beaches;tidal flats etc. Construction of embankment for protection of erosion in Sunderbans is foundto have an adverse impact on the fragile ecology of the Sunderbans.,*,2015,*

Anthropogenic Interferences,Gautam Kumar Das,Abstract The vibrant ecosystem of Sunderbans with its lush green mangrove forest; varioustypes of aquatic species including many rare endemic flora and fauna; birds; crocodiles andthe famous Royal Bengal Tiger is a unique Biosphere Reserve. Unfortunately such aproductive ecosystem is now exposed to threats of extinction. Besides the natural globalphenomena; the land degrading anthropogenic activity is one of the prime factors for thisecological decline. In a forest-society interface; unplanned over exploitation of naturalresources is very common. In the case of Sunderbans also; as a result of continuouslyincreasing population pressure almost half of the mangrove forest have been cut down tosupply fuel wood; land reclamation for settlement and aquaculture and various otherpurposes.

Sunderbans: Physical Aspects and Configurations,Gautam Kumar Das,Abstract Sunderbans forms a part of the world's largest fluvio-marine Ganges–Brahmaputradeltaic plain at the confluence of the Bay of Bengal with the largest block of halophyticmangrove forest. It has passed through a dynamic and complex physiographical andgeomorphological history. Prograding in phases towards Bay of Bengal during Plio-Pleistocene inter-glacial period; it has left behind numerous distinctive landforms andislands of various shapes and sizes. The intricate network of rivers; tidal creeks and inletswith dynamic flow pattern accelerates the process of erosion and accretion and make thegeomorphic set-up of the area a complex one. The important morphotypes of Sunderbansare beaches and inlets; creeks and estuaries; mudflats; coastal dunes; sand flats andmangrove swamps.,*,2015,*
Estuarine and Coastal Erosions,Gautam Kumar Das,Abstract Sunderbans is characterised by anastomising network of tidal rivers; creeks andminor salt water courses. This estuarine coast is undergoing continuous changes due to theaction of the asymmetric tidal flow regime; river fluxes; waves; sea level change and thevagaries of nature in the form of cyclones and storms which are almost regular phenomena.Depositional and erosional features are observed at river banks; point bars; mid channelbars and the intertidal swash platforms. Sandy deposits are eroded because ofresuspension and transported by seaward waves and tides whereas mud is eroded byscouring and transported by suspension. The erosion and accretion process over theSunderbans delta might have a bearing on the neotectonic activity on the Bengal Basin.,*,2015,*
Brackish Water,Gautam Kumar Das,Abstract The rivers of Sunderbans along with its numerous creeks; tidal inlets and estuariesforming an anastomising network together with submerged swamps and marshes; constituteits low saline brackish water body. The brackish water of Sunderbans have the potential forthe growth of mangroves and is the breeding ground for large varieties of fin fish and shellfishes. Neo tectonic movement has resulted in the change of courses for the river Hooghlywhich impeded fresh water flow towards Sunderbans. Changes brought by regional andglobal processes; climatic changes etc. have resulted in increasing trends of water and soilsalinity; loss of biodiversity; degrading soil and water quality which are not congenial for thisvulnerable ecosystem.,*,2015,*
Mangrove Ecosystems,Gautam Kumar Das,Abstract A combination of estuarine and mangrove forest ecosystem is the characteristics ofthe Sunderbans region. Natural processes like tidal surge; cyclones etc.; acting singularly orin combination; have made the Sunderbans mangroves ecosystem most fragile and harsh.This large block of halophytic mangrove ecosystem is highly productive which provideslarge quantities of organic detritus which is considered as primary food for the naturalhabitats of this ecosystem. The close relationship between microbe–nutrient–plant acts as amechanism to recycle and conserve nutrients in the mangrove ecosystem. Hydrological;biogeochemical and ecological functions of mangrove have direct bearing on socio-economic benefits of the region. The mangrove ecosystem of Sunderbans is highlydisturbed due to over exploitation of mangrove forests and unplanned land use pattern.,*,2015,*

Sedimentary Structures: Indicators of Hydrodynamic Situations,Gautam Kumar Das,Abstract: Sedimentary structures are primary or mechanical structures formed by physicalprocesses in the sedimentary environment. Sedimentary structures and bedforms aresynonymous and the bedforms are the primary sedimentary structures formed by theinteractions between turbulence of flow and sediment grains. Bedforms; though not static;are permanent features which often exhibit a quasi-equilibrium form under effectsofunsteadiness in a tidal situation of estuarine environment. Three different scales ofbedforms are recognisable in the different geomorphic units like mid channel bars; pointbars; river mouth bars etc in the mesomacrotidal estuaries viz.; the small-scale; theintermediate-scale and the large scale. The small scale bedforms include all varieties ofripple marks; the intermediate scale embodies two different megaripples types and the …,Geographical Review of India,2014,*
Corrosion Behaviour of Stainless Steel Grade 304 IN–1MHCL,Ajit Kumar; Nitesh Kumar; Anjani Kumar Singh; G Das,Abstract The corrosion behaviour of 304 grade stainless steel is studied in presence of HClsolution with concentration of 1M. The experiment is tested by the potentistatic polarizationtechniques. Due to the presence of chloride ions (Cl-) 304 grade is very much susceptible tothecorrosion of pitting type. The low corrosion resistance was due to surface passive filmwith less protective to reveal high anodic dissolution rate. The mechanism of corrosion is asalso discussed. The oxidised 304 stainless steel is active on immersion; resulting in a lowcorrosion potential and a high weight loss. After certain duration the stainless steel eitherremains active or becomes passive depending on HCl content. At low HCl contents; anongoing active-to-passive transition results in localised corrosion at pits; grain boundariesand honeycombed recesses. Because of anodic brightening; the 304 stainless steel is …,International Journal of Innovative Research and Development,2014,*

STATCOM; TCSC & UPFC,SM Padmaja; G Tulasiram Das,Abstract. Modern electric power utilities are facing many challenges due to ever increasingcomplexity in their operation and structure. One problem that received wide attention isvoltage instability. One of the major causes of voltage instability in the power system is withits reactive power limit. Voltage instability is the cause of the system voltage collapse; inwhich the power system voltage decays to a level; from which point; it is unable to recover.Voltage collapse may lead to partial or full power interruption in the system. Providingadequate reactive power support at the appropriate location solves voltage instabilityproblems. Improving the systems reactive power handling capacity with Flexible ACTransmission System (FACTS) devices is one remedy for prevention of the voltage instabilityand voltage collapse.

Dual blockade of renin-angiotensin system in diabetic nephropathy: review of literature and local experience: achieving best practice,Parijat De; Gautam Das; Karen Harley; Harikrishan Nair,Albuminuria and hypertension are predictors of poor renal and cardiovascular outcome inpatients with diabetic nephropathy (DN). Intensive treatment requires blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by either angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors orangiotensin receptor blockers (ARB); which reduce blood pressure and proteinuria.Combining the two therapies has shown greater benefits than either drug alone to reduceprogression of DN. Although treatment goals are more likely to be achieved with thecombination; this requires close monitoring of serum creatinine and potassium whichinvariably rise on such therapy.,South African Journal of Diabetes and Vascular Disease,2006,*

of Proceedings: Proceedings 2004 VLDB Conference: The 30th International Conference on Very Large Databases (VLDB),Martin Theobald; Gerhard Weikum; Ralf Schenkel,Abstract/Description: Top-k queries based on ranking elements of multidimensional datasetsare a fundamental building block for many kinds of information discovery. The best knowngeneral-purpose algo-rithm for evaluating top-k queries is Fagin's threshold algorithm (TA).Since the user's goal behind top-k queries is to identify one or a few relevant and novel dataitems; it is intriguing to use approximative variants of TA to reduce run-time costs. This paperintroduces a family of approximative top-k algorithms based on probabilistic arguments.When scanning index lists of the underlying multidimensional data space in descendingorder of local scores; various forms of convolution and derived bounds are employed topredict when it is safe; with high probability; to drop candidate items and to prune the indexscans.

Kinetic Modelling On Vapor Phase Catalytic Hydrodenitrogenation Of Quinoline,Gautam Das; R Hughes,Hydrotreating is an important process in petroleum refining to produce environmentallyacceptable petroleum products. This includes both hydrodesulphurisation (HDS) involvingremoval of sulphur compounds and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) in which organic andmetallic nitrogen compounds are removed from hydrocarbon feedstock. It has long beenrecognised that HDN is more difficult than HDS; the former has been of little concern to therefiners because of the small quantity of nitrogen compounds present in conventionalpetroleum slocks. However the interest for this process has started to increase because ofgrowing need to process heavy and low quality crude oil; and anticipated need to upgradesynthetic crude;'both of which are rich in nitrogen compounds.

Solvent-induced crystallisation of compatible poly (styrene-co-acrylonitrile) and poly (vinyl chloride-co-vinyl acetate) blends,Gaurab Das; AN Banerjee,Abstract The influence of solvent on the development of crystallinity in a compatible poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile)(SAN) and poly (vinyl chloride-co-vinyl acetate)(VYHH) blend hasbeen studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); optical microscopy; Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR); and a wide angle X-ray diffraction method (WAXD);confirming the presence of crystallinity in the blend. The low temperature casting of theblends developed a considerable amount of solvent-induced crystallinity in one componentof the blend; whereas the higher temperature casting of the blends and also thecoprecipitated blends showed no sign of development of crystallinity in the blend. So;solvent retention during film formation was responsible for the observed crystallinity in onecomponent of the blend.,European polymer journal,1996,*

Seed Biology Laboratory; Bose Institute; Calcutta-700 009; India,SOMEN NANDI; GITALI DAS; SWATI SEN-MANDI,Seeds of different vigour also differ in their germination ability. In rice (Oryza sativa); thisdifference was correlated with the level of incorporation of" S-methionine into 25–60%ammonium sulphate precipitable material that was rich in amylase proteins. This proteinfraction; from dry seeds; contained no c-amylase activity. In contrast;/-amylase activity waspresent in all seed stocks capable of 99% germination; although the level was lower inseeds that grew slowly when germinated. In low viability low vigour stock (ie extensivelydeteriorated seeds)/-amylase activity was absent. Alpha-amylase activity in all stocks wasdetected only after 24 h from the start of imbibition. These results indicate that/-amylaseactivity is a reliable indicator of the germination ability of rice seed stocks and of their vigour"during germination.,Annals of Botany,1995,*

Irradiation creep-a review,IS Batra; Gupta Das,The dimensional stability of structural components of a nuclear reactor-be it thermal; fast orfusion-is of paramount importance for its safe and economic operation. The distortion of corecomponents including fuel can take place because of radiation induced creep; growth andswelling. Though such distortions may be unavoidable to some extent and; somtimes;beneficial too; the ability to predict the behaviour of components as accurately as possible isabsolutely essential for purposes not only of design but also of safe operation of reactors.The present write-up; undertaken with an aim to review irradiation creep in nonfissile metalsand alloys; deals with the subject in a rather qualitative manner. The mathematical approachis purposely avoided to reduce the complexity of understanding as it exists today in this fieldand to spare space for the involved arguments relevant to the subject.(author). 130 refs,Transactions of the Indian Institute of Metals,1988,*
Directional Compton profile studies in KCl,G Das; HC Padhi,Abstract Compton scattering of 59.54 keV gamma-rays in single-crystal potassium chloride(KCl) along the (100) and (110) directions is reported for the first time. The measuredabsolute profiles and the anisotropy J 100 (q)-J 110 (q) are found to be in reasonableagreement with the LCAO result except for the small deviations. The experimental andtheoretical autocorrelation functions B (Z) for the two directions are compared with eachother. The experimental B-value for the (100) direction was found to be in good agreementwith theory whereas some deviation was observed for the (100) direction.,Journal of Physics C: Solid State Physics,1987,*
Experiences with Distributed Longest Path Algorithms,Barton P Miller; Cui-Qing Yang,Abstract As part of our research in performance tools for parallel and distributed programswe have developed longest path algorithms to calculate critical paths in program activitygraphs. These longest path algorithms include both parallel distributed algorithms andcentralized algorithms. Program activity graphs were derived from measurements ofapplication programs and used to test these algorithms. This paper presents ourexperiences in developing; implementing and testing longest path algorithms for the criticalpath analysis. Both our centralized and distributed algorithms are based on the technique ofdiffusing computation. We have tested variations of these algorithms with graphs built fromtraces of different application programs. We compare the performance behavior of thedistributed and centralized algorithms and discuss various aspects that affect the speed …,*,1987,*

CHEMICAL STABILISATION OF SAND STABILISATION BY CHEMICAL SPRAYING,R Gopal; YP SINGH; OP Bhati; J Singh; J Bhati; I SINGH; PK Ghosh; MS Parihar; G Das,Experimental stabilisation of desert sand by spraying with urea formaldehyde (uf) resin andsoluble sodium silicate. Field trials were carried out to compare injection seepage andgrouting techniques after a series of experiments to determine curing time and the optimummixtures for maxiumum crushing strength. The effect of trafficking was studied and also thestabilisation of pegs was measured by the amount of force needed to dislodge the peg.Spraying with uf resin was not as effective as grouting and although the strength wassufficient for running vehicles it was three times less than grouting and rutting soon tookplace. The quantity of chemicals needed in spraying was nearly double that required ingrouting. The technique was useful for the stabilisation of depth up to 1cm to stop the raisingof sand around helipads and aircraft landing grounds.

Secondary overgrowth of quartz with multiple rims of inclusions suggests theirderivation from sedimentary rocks of different cycles of sedimentation. The heavy mineralassemblage in the sediments lead to conclude that the sediments have been derived fromthe acid igneous rocks of the Himalayas in the north and the metamorphic rocks of thePrecambrian shields of the west and north-west of Bengal Basin.

Status of Free Radical and its Scavenging System with,Gitali Das; Shammi Raj; Jacob Pothen; MR Sethuraj; TP Sinha; Swati Sen-Mandi,Tapping panel dryness (TPD) syndrome is expressed initially by prolonged (late) dripping oflatex followed by pre-coagulation of latex in the tapping panel itself which culminates intodeath of latex-bearing cells. The syndrome is found to be due to a cumulative effect of manyfactors like over-tapping; over dosage of stimulation and sub-optimal agro-climaticconditions. In an attempt to understand the role of free radical and its scavenging systems inoccurrence of TPD; studies have been undertaken to estimate free radical (FR) by electronparamagnetic resonance spectrometer with simultaneous assessment of superoxidedismutase (SOD; EC 1.15. 1.1); in the laticiferous cellos/latex of five different clones ofrubber.

This method is verysimple and systematic. It can be applied to compute the feed forward control law (iegeneralized forces and torques) about the desired trajectory (ie defined robot task space)and to design the feedback controller that reduces or eliminates any deviations from thetarget object placed in a defined robot space task. The salient advantage of this method isthat the robot along with its system complexities can track target very efficiently and can liftthe specified object effectively at specific position and angle by minimizing the steady stateerror. Computationally it has been found that this method tracks the target in much lesser …,*,*,*

Characteristics of Corrosion Scales on Pipeline Steel in CO2-Saturated NaCl Brine Solution,GS Das,Abstract--The present study is aimed to conduct the experiments in various corrosiveenvironments at various temperatures and constant partial pressures of carbon dioxide(CO2) under dynamic condition to understand the basic mechanism and corrosionresistance of carbon steel. Usually; API grade steels are used in the pipeline for carrying thecrude oil and gas. Corrosion problems constitute the major operating difficulty in the oil andgas industry particularly in the transportation system from refinery to the different sourcestation and have caused unscheduled downtime; production losses and reduced equipmentlife. The presence of CO2 and addition of H2S in the solution is an important parameterwhich affects the severity of corrosion in steel. Thus it is a challenging and most importanttask to study the corrosion of steel in most affected corrosive environment. Few …,*,*,*

Advanced NDTs for Inspection of Catalyst Tubes of Reformer Furnace,Gautam Das; D Dutta; Kaushik Boral; Gourab Seal,Abstract The Reformer tubes used in the refining; petrochemical and fertilizer industries aremanufactured by the centrifugal casting process of heat-resistant austenitic alloys such asHK-40; HP-40; and HP-Niobium modified materials. These tubes are prone to variousdegradation mechanisms like creep; hydrogen attack; corrosion; fatigue etc and the usefullife of these tubes is largely dependent on operation and maintenance. Also; as these tubesare operated at severe conditions; the determination of the serviceability of these tubesbeyond their design life of 100;000 operating hours is of vital importance. A range of NDTsare presently available which provides the opportunity to improve the reliable service life ofreformer tubes. Thus; rather than to remove tubes from service for sectioning andmetallurgical examination at every plant turnaround; it is advantageous to use NDE …,*,*,*

SUNDERBAN BIOSPHERE RESERVE; NE INDIA,A Bhattacharya; SK Sarkar; GK Das; S Giri; G Bose; K Mitra; D Dey,Abstract A huge mudflat along the Moynapara creek at Kakdwip (21" 54" N; 88 10'E) withinthe Sunderban Biosphere Reserve; northeast India was studied for understanding itsphysical and biological sedimentation processes. The tidal creek is connected to theMooriganga River; a distributary of the River Hooghly and is fed by the coastal brackishwaters of the Bay of Bengal. The sedimentation process is primarily controlled by semi-diurnal; mesomacrotidal rhythm and recycling ofcoastal waters through the creek system.The mudflat lies in a sheltered low energy setting of the deltaic West Bengal. Ofthe threeidentifiable creekparallel subdivisions; the Upper mudflat is well compacted andis largelyconverted into a grassland. The Middle mudflatis characterised by sporadic clusters of dwarfmangroves along borders of the traversing creeks through the mudflat. Arising from the …,*,*,*
MAN-MADE ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION AT SUNDERBANS,Gautam Kumar Das; Siddhartha Datta,Abstract: The vibrant ecosystem of Sunderbans with its lush green mangrove forest; varioustypes of aquatic species including many rare endemic flora and fauna; birds; crocodiles andthe famous Royal Bengal Tiger is a unique Biosphere Reserve. Unfortunately such aproductive ecosystem is now exposed to threats of extinction. Besides the natural globalphenomena; the land degrading anthropogenic activity is one of the prime factors for thisecological decline. In a forest-society interface; unplanned over exploitation of naturalresources is very common. In the case of Sunderbans also; as a result of continuouslyincreasing population pressure almost half of the mangrove forest have been cut down tosupply fuel wood; land reclamation for settlement and aquaculture and various otherpurposes. The situation has become precarious as there seems to be a striking …,*,*,*

Data Engineering,Sanjay Krishnan; Jiannan Wang; Michael J Franklin; Ken Goldberg; Tim Kraska; Tova Milo; Eugene Wu; Yachao Lu; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,Abstract There has been much research on various aspects of Approximate QueryProcessing (AQP); such as different sampling strategies; error estimation mechanisms; andvarious types of data synopses. However; many subtle challenges arise when building anactual AQP engine that can be deployed and used by real world applications. Thesesubtleties are often ignored (or at least not elaborated) by the theoretical literature andacademic prototypes alike. For the first time to the best of our knowledge; in this article; wefocus on these subtle challenges that one must address when designing an AQP system.Our intention for this article is to serve as a handbook listing critical design choices thatdatabase practitioners must be aware of when building or using an AQP system; not toprescribe a specific solution to each challenge.,*,*,*

Efficient Ad-hoc Approximate Query Processing in Peer-to-Peer Databases1,Benjamin Arai; Gautam Das; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Vana Kalogeraki,ABSTRACT Peer-to-peer databases are becoming prevalent on the Internet for distributionand sharing of documents; applications; and other digital media. The problem of answeringlarge scale; ad-hoc analysis queries–eg; aggregation queries–on these databases posesunique challenges. Exact solutions can be time consuming and difficult to implement giventhe distributed and dynamic nature of peer-to-peer databases. In this paper we presentnovel sampling-based techniques for approximate answering of ad-hoc aggregation queriesin such databases. Computing a high-quality random sample of the database efficiently inthe P2P environment is complicated due to several factors–the data is distributed (usually inuneven quantities) across many peers; within each peer the data is often highly correlated;and moreover; even collecting a random sample of the peers is difficult to accomplish.

XQuery Evaluation with Relevance Ranking in Structured Peer-to-Peer Systems,Leonidas Fegaras; Gautam Das; David Levine; Weimin He; Hao Zhou,Abstract This paper addresses the problem of publishing; indexing; and querying large XMLdata repositories distributed over an existing peer-to-peer (P2P) service infrastructure. Ourarchitecture scales gracefully to the network and data sizes by supporting thousands ofnodes; massive data; and frequent queries and updates. It is fully distributed; fault tolerantand self-organizing; and handles complex queries efficiently; even those queries that usefull-text search; approximate matching; and inter-document relationships. It also providesbalanced workload and storage; low search traffic and latency; and low maintenanceoverhead. The novelty of our framework is that it is both a sophisticated data managementand an IR system. It extends state-ofthe-art database technologies; such as XML indexingand advanced XQuery processing; to work in a distributed P2P environment. It also …,*,*,*
AGGREGATES DISCLOSURE IN HIDDEN WEB DATABASES: AN URGENT CHALLENGE,Gautam Das; Nan Zhang,ABSTRACT Hidden web databases are widely prevalent on the Internet. Security issuesspecific to hidden databases; however; have been largely overlooked by the researchcommunity; possibly due to the (false) sense of security provided by the restrictive access(ie; web interface) to such databases. We argue that an urgent challenge facing today'shidden databases is the disclosure of sensitive aggregates enabled by recent studies on thesampling of hidden databases through its public web interface. We identify the impact ofaggregates disclosure on such critical issues as business secrets and national security. Toprotect sensitive aggregates; we enunciate the key design principles; propose a three-component design; and suggest a number of possible techniques that may protect sensitiveaggregates while maintaining the service quality for normal search users. Our hope is that …,*,*,*
