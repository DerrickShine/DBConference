Cloud computing–a classification; business models; and research directions,Christof Weinhardt; Arun Anandasivam; Benjamin Blau; Nikolay Borissov; Thomas Meinl; Wibke Michalk; Jochen Stößer,Abstract Lately; a new computing paradigm has emerged:“Cloud Computing”. It seems to bepromoted as heavily as the “Grid” was a few years ago; causing broad discussions on thedifferences between Grid and Cloud Computing. The first contribution of this paper is thus adetailed discussion about the different characteristics of Grid Computing and CloudComputing. This technical classification allows for a well-founded discussion of the businessopportunities of the Cloud Computing paradigm. To this end; this paper first presents abusiness model framework for Clouds. It subsequently reviews and classifies current Cloudofferings in the light of this framework. Finally; this paper discusses challenges that have tobe mastered in order to make the Cloud vision come true and points to promising areas forfuture research.,Business & Information Systems Engineering,2009,464

Interdisciplinary environmental education: elements of field identity and curriculum design,Shirley Vincent; Will Focht,Abstract Interdisciplinary environmental degree programs (environmental studies/science (s)and similar programs) in higher education in the USA are both diverse and dynamic in theircurriculum designs. Though these characteristics afford flexibility and adaptability; they arealso seen as weaknesses that can undermine programs' perceived legitimacy both withinand beyond their host institutions. The lack of a clear identity; definition of corecompetencies; and prescriptions for interdisciplinary pedagogy can create confusion amongprogram stakeholders and skepticism among institutional administrators. To learn moreabout how interdisciplinary environmental curricula vary across the USA; a national surveywas conducted of program administrators to investigate their programs and identify theirviews of what an ideal curriculum would entail.

Service value networks,Benjamin Blau; Jan Kramer; Tobias Conte; Clemens Van Dinther,The current industry-driven trend of providing flexible e-services lays the ground for the newresearch area``service value networks''(SVNs). We observe a rising number of industry-oriented publications provided by research departments of large companies such as IBM orSAP as well as the fact that more and more IS conferences offer special tracks on that issue.However; when it comes to formalizing and economically analyzing such SVNs that offerjoint complex services to service customers; scientific approaches are in their infancy. Weintend to fill this research gap by providing a clear understanding of service value networksby defining their characteristics; their structure; and their components. Mapping theseaspects into a formalized model; we intend to establish a reference point for future work inthe area of service value networks.,Commerce and Enterprise Computing; 2009. CEC'09.

Towards an Efficient Decision Policy for Cloud Service Providers.,Arun Anandasivam; Christof Weinhardt,Abstract Cloud service providers may face the problem of how to price infrastructure servicesand how this pricing may impact the resource utilization. One aspect of this problem is howCloud service providers would decide to accept or reject requests for services when theresources for offering these services become scarce. A decision support policy calledCustomized Bid-Price Policy (CBPP) is proposed in this paper to decide efficiently; when alarge number of services or complex services can be offered over a finite time horizon. Thisheuristic outperforms well-known policies; if bid prices cannot be updated frequently duringincoming requests and an automated update of bid prices is required to achieve moreaccurate decisions. Since CBPP approximates the revenue offline before the requests occur;it has a low runtime compared to other approaches during the online phase. The …,ICIS,2010,28
Provisioning of Service Mashup Topologies.,Benjamin Blau; Wibke Michalk; Dirk Neumann; Christof Weinhardt,Abstract Service-orientation has gained great momentum in technological and economicalmatter. This development forces companies to drive new strategies such as servicedifferentiation; coopetition and engaging into dynamic service ecosystems. Traditional ideasof static value chains give way to agile service value networks where many decentralizedservice providers compete and cooperate in the creation of value added mashed-upservices. Nevertheless; there is a lack of efficient ways to design service mashupsconsidering service configurations; interrelations and incompatibilities. There is a necessityto foster flexible allocation of sub-services and dynamic pricing. Currently; services aremostly charged statically via flat fees or pay-per-use prices. This is controversial becauseespecially in short-living environments as service markets; there is a great demand for …,ECIS,2008,25
A multidimensional procurement auction for trading composite services,Benjamin Blau; Tobias Conte; Clemens van Dinther,Abstract Recently; static value chains have gradually been giving way to highly agile servicevalue networks. This involves novel economic and organizational challenges. Added valuefor customers is created by feasible compositions of distributed service components. Thiswork focuses on the design of a multidimensional procurement auction for trading servicecompositions and the analysis of strategies for service providers that participate in theprocurement process. The mechanism implementation is incentive-compatible; so that itresults in an equilibrium in which revealing the true multidimensional type (quality of serviceand valuation) is a weakly-dominant strategy for all service providers.

Planning and pricing of service mashups,Benjamin Blau; Dirk Neumann; Christof Weinhardt; Steffen Lamparter,Today's development and provision of commercially used Web services has shifted fromproviding static and predefined functionality to highly configurable services that can bedynamically combined by customers. This new form of composed services called servicemashups integrate functionality of multiple sub-services from decentralized providers.Consequently this leads to a high configuration complexity and presents new challenges inthe field of planning and pricing of service offerings such as validation of serviceconfigurations as well as price determination. Facing these challenges this paper presentsan ontology framework for describing technical as well as economic interdependenciesbetween services and shows how planing and pricing algorithms for dynamic Webscenarios can be implemented.

Our approach focuseson B2B service organizations which provide their customers with complex solutions andwhose relationship with the customer is distributed among multiple employees and acrossdifferent business units. The suggested approach should improve the systematic analysis ofcustomer intimacy in organizations; leverage the customer knowledge scattered throughoutthe organization and enable benchmarking and focused investments in customerrelationships.,International Conference on Exploring Services Science,2010,13
Enabling service networks through contribution-based value distribution,Tobias Conte; Benjamin Blau; Gerhard Satzger; Clemens van Dinther,Abstract Products increasingly turn into services. A prime example for this trend is thesoftware industry. Specialized vendors leverage their core competencies in service valuenetworks that offer joint complex services to customers. Such service value networks are intheir infancy; yet both academics and practitioners lack approaches to formalize andeconomically analyze them. Our objective is to reward service providers not only for theirinclusion in a particular service rendered; but also for their mere presence in the network.Purpose of such a scheme is to incentivize vendors to join the network and to enforce certainnetwork characteristics from an operator's point of view. To this end; we introduce a metric toexpress the contribution of service providers to the whole network–the power ratio.

Formation of service value networks for decentralized service provisioning,Sebastian Speiser; Benjamin Blau; Steffen Lamparter; Stefan Tai,Abstract The provisioning of complex services requires tight collaboration between diverseservice providers and their customers harmonizing supply and demand chains to a highlyflexible; dynamic and decentralized service value network. Peers in such a networkautonomously delegate (sub-) tasks which cannot be done efficiently by themselves to othermore suitable peers in their community. In this paper; we propose an architecture for suchservice communities that features decentralized service provisioning based on current Webtechnologies. In this context; we present an algorithm for efficient service value networkformation and show by means of a simulation that sufficiently sized service networks canfulfill practically all customer requests.

Reducing risk or increasing profit? Provider decisions in agreement networks,Wibke Michalk; Lilia Filipova-Neumann; Benjamin Blau; Christof Weinhardt,The rise of Software as a Service (SaaS) composition platforms and so called ComputeClouds demonstrates the growing demand for the agile composition of Web Services. Inorder to facilitate the composition of services and value-creation; service providers need tocollaborate. This collaboration is regulated by means of Service Level Agreements (SLAs)where the parties; the executed service as well as guarantees on the service execution arespecified. This work presents the concept of Service Value Networks and AgreementNetworks as the underlying legal structure. Furthermore; an approach is introduced thatallows a service provider to select the risk-minimal SLA portfolio. In a further step; theapproach is extended in order to allow for a tradeoff between risk and expected profit fromthe service execution.

Service value networks: Unleashing the combinatorial power of service mashups,Jan Krämer; Tobias Conte; Benjamin Blau; Clemens van Dinther; Christof Weinhardt,Abstract: The long tail phenomenon has been heavily discussed in recent years. What hasbeen neglected so far is its striking relevance for electronic services. Whereas consumersexpectations about information goods are often vague and transient; their requirements arepronounced and specific when it comes to the functional and non-functional characteristicsof electronic services. Moreover; modular services can be combined and configured intoservice mashups that have the potential to meet complex consumer requirements. In thisvein; the long tail phenomenon can be leveraged into a new dimension–the long valley;where every service exerts positive network externalities on the remaining services; therebyspurring an increase in supply and demand.

The on-demandprovisioning of services gains more and more influence. For offering enriched services thatare capable of performing complex tasks; the dynamic composition of such servicesbecomes important. In order to enable the collaboration between different service providers;technical and economic preliminaries have to be made. This work will cover economicconsiderations from the viewpoint of a service provider. Therefore; the concept of ServiceValue Networks is presented and an agreement network as underlying legal structure isillustrated.

Efficient QoS aggregation in service value networks,Steffen Haak; Benjamin Blau,In recent years; the trend towards standardization; simplification and modularization in theservice sector has fostered the raise of Service Value Networks where providers andconsumers jointly co-create value. With many different competing services available; theuser experience; which is captured by the non-functional Quality-of-Service (QoS) attributes;is an important competitive factor. QoS computation for complex Web services; ie theaggregation of QoS factors from atomic services; is essential for an automated an optimizedWeb service selection process. However; the computational complexity of QoS aggregationhas often been disregarded in the respective field of research; whereas computationalefficiency is inevitable for the application of optimization approaches in on-line scenarios.The threefold contribution of this paper consists of an elaboration on the computational …,System Science (HICSS); 2012 45th Hawaii International Conference on,2012,9
Efficient contracting in cloud service markets with asymmetric information-a screening approach,Rico Knapper; Benjamin Blau; Tobias Conte; Anca Sailer; Andrzej Kochut; Ajay Mohindra,Increasing popularity of cloud-based services has led to the emergence of cloudmarketplaces where services from different providers are offered; usually in the form of acatalog. The customers' decision about buying offered services is based on idiosyncraticpreferences regarding non-functional service attributes; eg; price; provider reputation; andquality of service. The customers' preferences are not necessarily known to providers at thetime the service (including pricing) is defined in the marketplace's service catalog. Thus;from a microeconomic perspective; we have to deal with information asymmetry onincomplete markets. On such markets; finding the optimal contracts (ie; non-functionalcharacteristics and prices) that maximize the provider's profit is challenging due toinformation uncertainty.

In order to enable the combination of services and hence; thecollaboration between different service providers; technical challenges like the compatibilityof interfaces have to be dealt with. Additionally; economic issues concerning profit; reliabilityand risk have to be taken into consideration. This work covers economic considerations fromthe viewpoint of a service intermediary that offers complex services to customers andpurchases services from supplying providers.

In order to deal with an increasing risk of unavailability or failure of mission-criticalWeb services we argue the need for advanced reservation of services in the form ofderivatives. The contribution of this paper is twofold: First we provide an abstract model of amarket design that enables the trade of derivatives for mission-critical Web services. Ourmodel satisfies requirements that result from service characteristics such as intangibility andthe impossibility to inventor services in order to meet fluctuating demand.

Offering innovativebusiness models which are capable of attracting service providers and consumers is areasonable strategy to beat competitors and to take advantage of network effects. Wedevelop a mechanism that introduces a novel way of distributing revenues among serviceproviders–the power ratio. Its underlying presumption is not only to compensate serviceproviders who actually contribute to a complex service offered at a time; but also to pay outpartners who are on standby–ie vendors that support the network's variety and stability; butactually do not contribute to the complex service delivered.

Managing the Quality of Modular Services--A Process-Oriented Aggregation of Expected Service Levels Based on Probability Distributions,Clemens van Dinther; Rico Knapper; Benjamin Blau; Tobias Conte; Arun Anandasivam,Service oriented architectures provide modular service components which can be combinedto complex services. Besides the problem of finding optimal combinations of servicecomponents the quality of the overall service (the complex service) is important. It is oftenassumed in literature that the quality of the individual service components is expressed asone single value (eg the average). In fact; we observe different probabilities for certainquality levels which are summarized in a probability distribution of the service levelindicators. Given the distribution of the quality levels of the individual service componentswe present an approach to aggregate these distribution functions. As such; we are able toderive one distribution function for the overall complex service. The distribution function ofthe complex service carries much more information than a single value.

The value generated by a service is mainlyrepresented by intangible elements exposed at execution (Hill 1977). Therefore; a serviceconsumer expects a service to function reliably and to deliver a consistent outcome at avariety of levels; ie Quality of Service (QoS). QoS is the key criterion to keep the businessside competitive as it has serious implications on the provider and consumer side(Papazoglou 2008). From a business perspective; QoS characteristics defined based ontechnical services within the infrastructural layer have to be aggregated to morebusinessrelevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)(Blake and Cummings 2007; Jaeger etal. 2004; Unger et al. 2008).

Networked Mechanism Design Incentive Engineering in Service Value Networks as Exemplified by the Co-Opetition Mechanism.,Tobias Conte; Benjamin Blau; Rico Knapper,ABSTRACT The software industry is currently experiencing a fundamental transition fromselling proprietary applications towards the provision of networked services–ie modularizedand specialized services composed in a plug-and-play fashion in networked servicesystems. In such service systems; participants' interests need to be aligned with thenetwork's global objectives in an incentive engineering approach. In more detail; this paperseeks to tackle the challenge of coordinating self-interested service providers in a co-opetitive environment by designing adequate mechanisms. However;“classic” mechanismdesign focuses on design goals such as efficiency; incentive compatibility and budgetbalance whose mere consideration does not always hit the target in service networks.Incorporating the requirements that are imposed by newly arising networked scenarios …,AMCIS,2010,3
Steering through Incentives in Large-Scale Lean Software Development,Benjamin S Blau; Tobias Hildenbrand; Rico Knapper; Athanasios Mazarakis; Yongchun Xu; Martin G Fassunge,Abstract The application of lean principles and agile project management techniques in thedomain of large-scale software product development has gained tremendous momentumover the last decade. This results in empowerment of individuals which leads to increasedflexibility but at the same time sacrifices managerial control through traditional steeringpractices. Hence; the design of adequate incentive schemes in order to align localoptimization and opportunistic behavior with the overall strategy of the company is a crucialactivity from a business perspective. Following an agent-based simulation approach withreinforcement learning; we (i) address the question of how information regarding backlogitem dependencies is shared within and in between development teams on the product levelsubject to different incentive schemes. We (ii) compare different incentive schemes …,International Conference on Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering,2011,2
Services vs. Web Services,Christof Weinhardt; Benjamin Blau; Tobias Conte; Lilia Filipova-Neumann; Thomas Meinl; Wibke Michalk,Abstract Without doubts; services have become the major driver of value creation in the lastdecades. This manifests in official statistics showing that services make up the largest part ofthe gross domestic product (GDP) in industrialized countries. In 2009; the share of the GDPwithin the European Union amounted to 71.9% and in the United States to 76.9% increasingsteadily over last years. This trend is further amplified by the “servicification” of traditionalproducts in many industries. According to Vargo and Lusch (2004); the major shift towards aservice-centered view is driven by changes in society and markets that lead to exchanges ofservices rather than goods. It is not only stagnant product demand in many domains; butalso the customers' demand for customized and sophisticated goods which has pushedeconomic value downstream–away from manufacturing and toward the offering of …,*,2011,2
Designing auctions for coordination in service networks,Clemens van Dinther; Benjamin Blau; Tobias Conte; Christof Weinhardt,Abstract The evolving service ecologies show new ways of value co-creation throughcombinations of multiple service components which are described in service offerings. Anopen issue in such a large service ecology is how to efficiently coordinate and price serviceofferings. Service offerings provide different functionality and quality. Customers need todistinguish their preferences on different combinations of service attributes. In this chapterwe address this issue of service offerings allocation and introduce a structure designapproach; Market Engineering; as an appropriate method to design such mechanism. Inorder to apply this approach to service systems we introduce a formal model and a definitionof service value networks. Examples exemplify our approach and we show one possiblestep towards implementing such a mechanism.,*,2011,2
Incentivation of service providers for efficient service composition agreements,Lilia Filipova-Neumann; Wibke Michalk; Benjamin Blau; Christof Weinhardt,Abstract The trend towards dynamic on-demand service provisioning requires thecollaboration of a high number of specialized service providers. One challenge of servicecomposition with numerous service providers is the rising uncertainty of service delivery;which depends inter alia on the providers' effort. Penalties for defecting from agreed servicelevel objectives serve to reduce the uncertainty of service provision and to incentivizeproviders. In a scenario; where an intermediary coordinates complementary serviceproviders and consumers; we derive the following results: the intermediary should notpursue as high as possible penalties because there are profit-maximizing providers' effortand penalties which decrease with the number of providers; a particular service provider'spenalty should not depend on this provider's but on all other service providers' …,Proceedings of the international conference on e-Commerce; e-Business and e-Service,2010,2
ValueGrids: Using Grids in Dynamic Service Value Networks,F Schulz; C Momm; D Westermann; B Blau; W Michalk; M Hedwig; D Rolli; OK Afaghi; A Schmidt,Abstract In recent years; Grid infrastructures have proven to be invaluable in the area ofscientific computing and high-performance computing (HPC). However; the use of Gridinfrastructures in complex business scenarios remains an open research topic. A major goalof the ValueGrids project; funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education andResearch (BMBF) as part of the German Grid initiative (D-Grid); is the development of aconcept to demonstrate how Grid infrastructures can substantially support complex businessscenarios.

Coordination and Pricing in Service Value Networks: A Mechanism Design Approach,Christof Weinhardt; Benjamin Blau; Tobias Conte; Lilia Filipova-Neumann; Thomas Meinl; Wibke Michalk,Abstract Weinhardt et al.(2003) and Neumann (2004) state that there is no generalmechanism available to fit any possible market setting. In accordance with this statement; itis necessary to present a suitable mechanism designed to fit the underlying field ofapplication. The adequacy of a mechanism depends; amongst others; on the properties ofthe trading objects.

Service Value Networks,Christof Weinhardt; Benjamin Blau; Tobias Conte; Lilia Filipova-Neumann; Thomas Meinl; Wibke Michalk,Abstract Following the service definition in Chap. 2; the organizational form of service valuenetworks (SVNs) will be introduced as a novel network type and specialization of businessnetworks. Section 3.2 contributes a fundamental definition of the SVN concept and itsdifferentiation from related network types. As it is shown; however; SVNs exhibit specialcharacteristics compared to the known definitions that are not yet sufficiently discussed andformulated. As both academics and practitioners still lack approaches to formalize andeconomically analyze SVNs; this research gap is filled by Sect. 3.3. It introduces aformalization of SVNs that will serve as the notational basis for the mechanism designapproaches introduced in Chap. 7 of this book.

Business Models,Christof Weinhardt; Benjamin Blau; Tobias Conte; Lilia Filipova-Neumann; Thomas Meinl; Wibke Michalk,Abstract Business models are oftentimes considered as “the most discussed and leastunderstood aspect of the web. There is so much talk about how the web changes traditionalbusiness models. But there is little clear-cut evidence of exactly what this means”(Rappa2001). Today; a whole decade later; this statement is still very true; especially when is istransferred to business models in newly arising business networks that are; for instance;fostered by Web service technologies. Business networks arise in an environment of intensebut possibly short-run cooperation between different service providers and require a highdegree of complementarity of services. For these requirements to be met; on the one handtechnological changes need to take place. On the other hand; business networks for theautomatic provisioning of Web services have some special economic features which must …,*,2011,1
Intelligent Service Management—Technologies and Perspectives,Sudhir Agarwal; Stephan Bloehdorn; Steffen Lamparter,Abstract Intelligent infrastructures; in particular Semantic Technologies; have accompaniedthe development to service-centric architectures and computing paradigms since the earlydays. In this contribution; we assess the current state of these technologies with respect tothe intelligent management of services and we describe the main developments that willmost likely shape the field in the future. As a general introduction; we structure thelandscape of services according to three complementary dimensions:(i) Level of Informationand Communication Technology (ICT) Involvement;(ii) Level of Co-Creation; and (iii) ServiceRole. In the main part; we focus on the following technology areas: semantic description ofservices incl. the acquisition of service descriptions; discovery and ranking algorithms;service composition; service markets; as well as service monitoring and analytics.,*,2011,1

State of the art in service modeling languages,Benjamin Blau; Clemens van Dinther; Michael Behrendt,Abstract Automated use of electronic services calls for comprehensive service descriptionlanguages. A couple of description languages have been developed so far each with aspecific focus. We distinguish three different layers; syntactic; semantic; and resourcedescription languages. In this paper we provide a condensed summary of servicedescription languages of all three layers as well as of such languages that incorporatemultiple concepts. The combination of syntactic; semantic and resource descriptionlanguages is the main precondition in order to support the process of automated serviceprovisioning as well as to implement reasonable billing and pricing functionality.,*,2007,1

Web Services Advanced Reservation Contracts,Christof Weinhardt; Benjamin Blau; Tobias Conte; Lilia Filipova-Neumann; Thomas Meinl; Wibke Michalk,Abstract In Chap. 5; the benefits which dynamic pricing mechanisms hold for providers aswell as customers were pointed out. Though already commonly used in practice both marketparticipants are faced with certain risks: Web service providers face the risk of low incomesin times of (unexpected) low utilization and demand; and are thus forced to lower their pricesaccordingly in order to keep up with their competitors. This may result in considerablelosses. On the other hand; Web service customers may run into situations where; despite ofa high willingness to pay; cannot fulfill their demand in peak times. While for the provider thisdilemma has mainly direct economic consequences only; it can become a more seriousissue to the customers than only high costs.,*,2011,*
Pricing Strategies for Platform Providers,Christof Weinhardt; Benjamin Blau; Tobias Conte; Lilia Filipova-Neumann; Thomas Meinl; Wibke Michalk,Abstract For several years; a change in the economy has been observed. The establishedfocus on products made way for a new perspective that concentrates on the provisioningrather than only the result; that is; on services. This development affects technical as well asorganizational aspects of the economy. On the one hand; service mashups and situationalapproaches are facilitated by dynamically composing Web services. RESTful architectures(Fielding and Taylor 2002) and slim messaging formats like JSON (Crockford 2006) supportthe technical feasibility of the aforementioned composition. This way; the interplay ofnumerous service providers is enabled which creates value by integrating the providedmodules into one joint solution; a complex service that is suited to meet individualcustomers' requirements.,*,2011,*
The Vision of Web Service Markets,Christof Weinhardt; Benjamin Blau; Tobias Conte; Lilia Filipova-Neumann; Thomas Meinl; Wibke Michalk,Abstract Services become a central building block of value creation in today's society. Noveltechnical; economic; and organizational challenges arise from their unique nature asservices' provision and consumption coincide in time (Hill 1977). Recognizing andunderstanding the importance of an efficient design; production; and provision of servicesunder the presence of their special characteristics is inevitable for individuals and thesociety to compete in today's global economy. Especially; rapid service innovation driven bythe power of modularity that is inherent in the concept of services (Baldwin and Clark 2000)embodies the success factor in service-centric environments. However; when composingdistributed service activities; the question of an efficient form of coordination comes to lightand turns out to be fundamental to govern distributed value creation.

Pricing Foundations and Implications on Web Service Pricing,Christof Weinhardt; Benjamin Blau; Tobias Conte; Lilia Filipova-Neumann; Thomas Meinl; Wibke Michalk,Abstract One of the key building parts of a market is its market mechanism. This mechanismencloses the rules for allocation and pricing and thus regulates and; in some cases;enforces the procedures of trading on a specific market. In general; both issues of allocationand pricing are intrinsically tied to one another. Neumann et al.(2007) and Buyya etal.(2008) treat online trading platforms. For example; such as Grid and Cloud serviceexchanges. Yet; since allocation procedures are often directly connected to technicalconditions; in the following the focus is mostly on the pricing mechanisms that are used intoday's markets. Basically; one can distinguish between static; flexible; and dynamic pricing;which can be further subdivided into concrete pricing schemes.,*,2011,*

Software product lines consist of a set of software products that sharea common; managed set of features. These product lines are developed from reusable coreassets incorporating variations in order to derive customer-specific product variants.
