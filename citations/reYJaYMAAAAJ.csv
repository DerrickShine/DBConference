LOF: identifying density-based local outliers,Markus M Breunig; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Raymond T Ng; Jörg Sander,Abstract For many KDD applications; such as detecting criminal activities in E-commerce;finding the rare instances or the outliers; can be more interesting than finding the commonpatterns. Existing work in outlier detection regards being an outlier as a binary property. Inthis paper; we contend that for many scenarios; it is more meaningful to assign to eachobject a degree of being an outlier. This degree is called the local outlier factor (LOF) of anobject. It is local in that the degree depends on how isolated the object is with respect to thesurrounding neighborhood. We give a detailed formal analysis showing that LOF enjoysmany desirable properties. Using real-world datasets; we demonstrate that LOF can be usedto find outliers which appear to be meaningful; but can otherwise not be identified withexisting approaches. Finally; a careful performance evaluation of our algorithm confirms …,ACM sigmod record,2000,3507
E cient and E ective Clustering Methods for Spatial Data Mining,Raymond T Ng; Jiawei Han,Abstract Spatial data mining is the discovery of interesting relationships and characteristicsthat may exist implicitly in spatial databases. In this paper; we explore whether clusteringmethods have a role to play in spatial data mining. To this end; we develop a new clusteringmethod called CLARANS which is based on randomized search. We also develop twospatial data mining algorithms that use CLARANS. Our analysis and experiments show thatwith the assistance of CLARANS; these two algorithms are very e ective and can lead todiscoveries that are di cult to nd with current spatial data mining algorithms. Furthermore;experiments conducted to compare the performance of CLARANS with that of existingclustering methods show that CLARANS is the most e cient.,Proceedings of VLDB,1994,2861
Algorithms for mining distancebased outliers in large datasets,Edwin M Knox; Raymond T Ng,Abstract This paper deals with finding outliers (exceptions) in large; multidimensionaldatasets. The identification of outliers can lead to the discovery of truly unexpectedknowledge in areas such as electronic commerce; credit card fraud; and even the analysis ofperformance statistics of professional athletes. Existing methods that we have seen forfinding outliers in large datasets can only deal efficiently with two dimensions/attributes of adataset. Here; we study the notion of DB-(Distance-Based) outliers. While we provide formaland empirical evidence showing the usefulness of DB-outliers; we focus on the developmentof algorithms for computing such outliers. First; we present two simple algorithms; bothhaving a complexity of O (k N'); k being the dimensionality and N being the number ofobjects in the dataset. These algorithms readily support datasets with many more than …,Proceedings of the International Conference on Very Large Data Bases,1998,1940
Distance-based outliers: algorithms and applications,Edwin M Knorr; Raymond T Ng; Vladimir Tucakov,Abstract This paper deals with finding outliers (exceptions) in large; multidimensionaldatasets. The identification of outliers can lead to the discovery of truly unexpectedknowledge in areas such as electronic commerce; credit card fraud; and even the analysis ofperformance statistics of professional athletes. Existing methods that we have seen forfinding outliers can only deal efficiently with two dimensions/attributes of a dataset. In thispaper; we study the notion of DB (distance-based) outliers. Specifically; we show that (i)outlier detection can be done efficiently for large datasets; and for k-dimensional datasetswith large values of k (eg; $ k\ge 5$); and (ii); outlier detection is a meaningful and importantknowledge discovery task.

Exploratory mining and pruning optimizations of constrained associations rules,Raymond T Ng; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Jiawei Han; Alex Pang,Abstract From the standpoint of supporting human-centered discovery of knowledge; thepresent-day model of mining association rules suffers from the following seriousshortcomings:(i) lack of user exploration and control;(ii) lack of focus; and (iii) rigid notion ofrelationships. In effect; this model functions as a black-box; admitting little user interaction inbetween. We propose; in this paper; an architecture that opens up the black-box; andsupports constraint-based; human-centered exploratory mining of associations. Thefoundation of this architecture is a rich set of constraint constructs; including domain; class;and SQL-style aggregate constraints; which enable users to clearly specify whatassociations are to be mined. We propose constrained association queries as a means ofspecifying the constraints to be satisfied by the antecedent and consequent of a mined …,ACM Sigmod Record,1998,945
CLARANS: A method for clustering objects for spatial data mining,Raymond T.  Ng; Jiawei Han,Spatial data mining is the discovery of interesting relationships and characteristics that mayexist implicitly in spatial databases. To this end; this paper has three main contributions.First; it proposes a new clustering method called CLARANS; whose aim is to identify spatialstructures that may be present in the data. Experimental results indicate that; whencompared with existing clustering methods; CLARANS is very efficient and effective.Second; the paper investigates how CLARANS can handle not only point objects; but alsopolygon objects efficiently. One of the methods considered; called the IR-approximation; isvery efficient in clustering convex and nonconvex polygon objects. Third; building on top ofCLARANS; the paper develops two spatial data mining algorithms that aim to discoverrelationships between spatial and nonspatial attributes. Both algorithms can discover …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2002,922
Finding intensional knowledge of distance-based outliers,Edwin M Knorr; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Existing studies on outliers focus only on the identification aspect; none providesany intensional knowledge of the outliers—by which we mean a description or anexplanation of why an identified outlier is exceptional. For many applications; a descriptionor explanation is at least as vital to the user as the identification aspect. Specifically;intensional knowledge helps the user to:(i) evaluate the validity of the identified outliers; and(ii) improve one's understanding of the data. The two main issues addressed in this paperare: what kinds of intensional knowledge to provide; and how to optimize the computation ofsuch knowledge. With respect to the first issue; we propose finding strongest and weakoutliers and their corresponding structural intensional knowledge. With respect to thesecond issue; we first present a naive and a semi-naive algorithm. Then; by means of …,VLDB,1999,575
On the marriage of lp-norms and edit distance,Lei Chen; Raymond Ng,Abstract Existing studies on time series are based on two categories of distance functions.The first category consists of the Lp-norms. They are metric distance functions but cannotsupport local time shifting. The second category consists of distance functions which arecapable of handling local time shifting but are nonmetric. The first contribution of this paperis the proposal of a new distance function; which we call ERP (" Edit distance with RealPenalty"). Representing a marriage of L1-norm and the edit distance; ERP can support localtime shifting; and is a metric. The second contribution of the paper is the development ofpruning strategies for large time series databases. Given that ERP is a metric; one way toprune is to apply the triangle inequality. Another way to prune is to develop a lower boundon the ERP distance. We propose such a lower bound; which has the nice computational …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,570
Predicting source code changes by mining change history,Annie TT Ying; Gail C Murphy; Raymond Ng; Mark C Chu-Carroll,Software developers are often faced with modification tasks that involve source which isspread across a code base. Some dependencies between source code; such as thosebetween source code written in different languages; are difficult to determine using existingstatic and dynamic analyses. To augment existing analyses and to help developers identifyrelevant source code during a modification task; we have developed an approach thatapplies data mining techniques to determine change patterns-sets of files that were changedtogether frequently in the past-from the change history of the code base. Our hypothesis isthat the change patterns can be used to recommend potentially relevant source code to adeveloper performing a modification task. We show that this approach can reveal valuabledependencies by applying the approach to the Eclipse and Mozilla open source projects …,IEEE transactions on Software Engineering,2004,532
A comprehensive analysis of common copy-number variations in the human genome,Kendy K Wong; Nirpjit S Dosanjh; Lindsey R Kimm; Ze Cheng; Douglas E Horsman; Calum MacAulay; Raymond T Ng; Carolyn J Brown; Evan E Eichler; Wan L Lam,Segmental copy-number variations (CNVs) in the human genome are associated withdevelopmental disorders and susceptibility to diseases. More importantly; CNVs mayrepresent a major genetic component of our phenotypic diversity. In this study; using a whole-genome array comparative genomic hybridization assay; we identified 3;654 autosomalsegmental CNVs; 800 of which appeared at a frequency of at least 3%. Of these frequentCNVs; 77% are novel. In the 95 individuals analyzed; the two most diverse genomes differedby at least 9 Mb in size or varied by at least 266 loci in content. Approximately 68% of the800 polymorphic regions overlap with genes; which may reflect human diversity in senses(smell; hearing; taste; and sight); rhesus phenotype; metabolism; and disease susceptibility.Intriguingly; 14 polymorphic regions harbor 21 of the known human microRNAs; raising …,The American Journal of Human Genetics,2007,517

Probabilistic logic programming,Raymond Ng; Venkatramanan Siva Subrahmanian,Abstract Of all scientific investigations into reasoning with uncertainty and chance;probability theory is perhaps the best understood paradigm. Nevertheless; all studiesconducted thus far into the semantics of quantitative logic programming have restrictedthemselves to non-probabilistic semantic characterizations. In this paper; we take a fewsteps towards rectifying this situation. We define a logic programming language that issyntactically similar to the annotated logics of Blair and Subrahmanian (Theoret. Comput.Sci. 68 (1987); 35–54; J. Non-Classical Logic5 (1988); 45–73) but in which the truth valuesare interpreted probabilistically. A probabilistic model theory and fixpoint theory isdeveloped for such programs. This probabilistic model theory satisfies the requirementsproposed by Fenstad (in “Studies in Inductive Logic and Probabilities”(RC Jeffrey; Ed.) …,Information and computation,1992,366
Indexing spatio-temporal trajectories with Chebyshev polynomials,Yuhan Cai; Raymond Ng,Abstract In this paper; we attempt to approximate and index a d-dimensional (d≥ 1) spatio-temporal trajectory with a low order continuous polynomial. There are many possible waysto choose the polynomial; including (continuous) Fourier transforms; splines; non-linearregressino; etc. Some of these possiblities have indeed been studied beofre. Wehypothesize that one of the best possibilities is the polynomial that minimizes the maximumdeviation from the true value; which is called the minimax polynomial. Minimaxapproximation is particularly meaningful for indexing because in a branch-and-boundsearch (ie; for finding nearest neighbours); the smaller the maximum deviation; the morepruning opportunities there exist. However; in general; among all the polynomials of thesame degree; the optimal minimax polynomial is very hard to compute. However; it has …,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2004,335
The New Jersey data reduction report,Daniel Barbar'a; William DuMouchel; Christos Faloutsos; Peter J Haas; Joseph M Hellerstein; Yannis Ioannidis; HV Jagadish; Theodore Johnson; Raymond Ng; Viswanath Poosala; Kenneth A Ross; Kenneth C Sevcik,Abstract this paper we describe and evaluate several popular techniques for data reduction.Historically; the primary need for data reduction has been internal to a database system; in acost-based query optimizer. The need is for the query optimizer to estimate the cost ofalternative query plans cheaply--clearly the effort required to do so must be much smallerthan the effort of actually executing the query; and yet the cost of executing any query plandepends strongly upon the numerosity of specified attribute values and the selectivities ofspecified predicates. To address these query optimizer needs; many databases keepsummary statistics. Sampling techniques have also been proposed. More recently; there hasbeen an explosion of interest in the analysis of data in warehouses. Data warehouses canbe extremely large; yet obtaining answers quickly is important.

Fast Computation of 2-Dimensional Depth Contours.,Theodore Johnson; Ivy Kwok; Raymond T Ng,Abstract" One person's noise is another person's signal." For many applications; includingthe detection of credit card frauds and the monitoring of criminal activities in electroniccommerce; an important knowledge discovery problem is the detection ofexceptional/outlying events. In computational statistics; one well-known approach to detectoutlying data points in a 2-D dataset is to assign a depth to each data point. Based on theassigned depths; the data points are organized in layers in the 2-D space; with theexpectation that shallow layers are more likely to contain outlying points than are the deeplayers. One robust notion of depth; called depth contours; was introduced by Tukey 17; 18].ISODEPTH; developed by Ruts and Rousseeuw 16]; is an algorithm that computes 2-Ddepth contours. In this paper; we give a fast algorithm; called FDC; for computing 2-D …,KDD,1998,281
Constraint-based; multidimensional data mining,Jiawei Han; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond T Ng,Although many data-mining methodologies and systems have been developed in recentyears; the authors contend that by and large; present mining models lack humaninvolvement; particularly in the form of guidance and user control. They believe that datamining is most effective when the computer does what it does best-like searching largedatabases or counting-and users do what they do best; like specifying the current miningsession's focus. This division of labor is best achieved through constraint-based mining; inwhich the user provides restraints that guide a search. Mining can also be improved byemploying a multidimensional; hierarchical view of the data. Current data warehousesystems have provided a fertile ground for systematic development of this multidimensionalmining. Together; constraint-based and multidimensional techniques can provide a more …,Computer,1999,234
Optics-of: Identifying local outliers,Markus M Breunig; Hans-Peter Kriegel; Raymond T Ng; Jörg Sander,Abstract For many KDD applications finding the outliers; ie the rare events; is moreinteresting and useful than finding the common cases; eg detecting criminal activities in E-commerce. Being an outlier; however; is not just a binary property. Instead; it is a propertythat applies to a certain degree to each object in a data set; depending on how 'isolated'thisobject is; with respect to the surrounding clustering structure. In this paper; we formallyintroduce a new notion of outliers which bases outlier detection on the same theoreticalfoundation as density-based cluster analysis. Our notion of an outlier is 'local'in the sensethat the outlier-degree of an object is determined by taking into account the clusteringstructure in a bounded neighborhood of the object. We demonstrate that this notion of anoutlier is more appropriate for detecting different types of outliers than previous …,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,1999,224
Optimization of constrained frequent set queries with 2-variable constraints,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond Ng; Jiawei Han; Alex Pang,Abstract Currently; there is tremendous interest in providing ad-hoc mining capabilities indatabase management systems. As a first step towards this goal; in [15] we proposed anarchitecture for supporting constraint-based; human-centered; exploratory mining of variouskinds of rules including associations; introduced the notion of constrained frequent setqueries (CFQs); and developed effective pruning optimizations for CFQs with 1-variable (1-var) constraints. While 1-var constraints are useful for constraining the antecedent andconsequent separately; many natural examples of CFQs illustrate the need for constrainingthe antecedent and consequent jointly; for which 2-variable (2-var) constraints areindispensable. Developing pruning optimizations for CFQs with 2-var constraints is thesubject of this paper. But this is a difficult problem because:(i) in 2-var constraints; both …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1999,220
Extracting knowledge from evaluative text,Giuseppe Carenini; Raymond T Ng; Ed Zwart,Abstract Capturing knowledge from free-form evaluative texts about an entity is achallenging task. New techniques of feature extraction; polarity determination and strengthevaluation have been proposed. Feature extraction is particularly important to the task as itprovides the underpinnings of the extracted knowledge. The work in this paper introducesan improved method for feature extraction that draws on an existing unsupervised method.By including user-specific prior knowledge of the evaluated entity; we turn the task of featureextraction into one of term similarity by mapping crude (learned) features into a user-definedtaxonomy of the entity's features. Results show promise both in terms of the accuracy of themapping as well as the reduction in the semantic redundancy of crude features.,Proceedings of the 3rd international conference on Knowledge capture,2005,206
Constraint-based clustering in large databases,Anthony KH Tung; Jiawei Han; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Constrained clustering—finding clusters that satisfy user-specified constraints—ishighly desirable in many applications. In this paper; we introduce the constrained clusteringproblem and show that traditional clustering algorithms (eg; k-means) cannot handle it. Ascalable constraint-clustering algorithm is developed in this study which starts by finding aninitial solution that satisfies user-specified constraints and then refines the solution byperforming confined object movements under constraints. Our algorithm consists of twophases: pivot movement and deadlock resolution. For both phases; we show that finding theoptimal solution is NP-hard. We then propose several heuristics and show how ouralgorithm can scale up for large data sets using the heuristic of micro-cluster sharing. Byexperiments; we show the effectiveness and efficiency of the heuristics.,International Conference on Database Theory,2001,205
Counting twig matches in a tree,Zhiyuan Chen; HV Jagadish; Flip Korn; Nick Koudas; S Muthukrishnan; Raymond Ng; Divesh Srivastava,Describes efficient algorithms for accurately estimating the number of matches of a smallnode-labeled tree; ie a twig; in a large node-labeled tree; using a summary data structure.This problem is of interest for queries on XML and other hierarchical data; to provide queryfeedback and for cost-based query optimization. Our summary data structure scalablyrepresents approximate frequency information about twiglets (ie small twigs) in the data tree.Given a twig query; the number of matches is estimated by creating a set of query twiglets;and combining two complementary approaches: set hashing; used to estimate the number ofmatches of each query twiglet; and maximal overlap; used to combine the query twigletestimates into an estimate for the twig query. We propose several estimation algorithms thatapply these approaches on query twiglets formed using variations on different twiglet …,Data Engineering; 2001.

A semantical framework for supporting subjective and conditional probabilities in deductive databases,Raymond Ng; Venkatramanan Siva Subrahmanian,Abstract We present a theoretical basis for supporting subjective and conditionalprobabilities in deductive databases. We design a language that allows a user greaterexpressive power than classical logic programming. In particular; a user can express the factthat A is possible (ie A has non-zero probability); B is possible; but (A⋀ B) as a whole isimpossible. A user can also freely specify probability annotations that may contain variables.The focus of this paper is to study the semantics of programs written in such a language inrelation to probability theory. Our model theory which is founded on the classical onecaptures the uncertainty described in a probabilistic program at the level of Herbrandinterpretations. Furthermore; we develop a fixpoint theory and a proof procedure for suchprograms and present soundness and completeness results. Finally we characterize the …,Journal of Automated Reasoning,1993,149

Parametric query optimization,Yannis E Ioannidis; Raymond T Ng; Kyuseok Shim; Timos K Sellis,Abstract In most database systems; the values of many important run-time parameters of thesystem; the data; or the query are unknown at query optimization time. Parametric queryoptimization attempts to identify several execution plans; each one of which is optimal for asubset of all possible values of the run-time parameters. We present a general formulation ofthis problem and study it primarily for the bu er size parameter. We adopt randomizedalgorithms as the main approach to this style of optimization and enhance them with asideways information passing feature that increases their e ectiveness in the new task.Experimental results of these enhanced algorithms show that they optimize queries for largenumbers of bu er sizes in the same time needed by their conventional versions for a singlebu er size; without much sacri ce in the output quality.,VLDB,1992,134

Integrating copy number polymorphisms into array CGH analysis using a robust HMM,Sohrab P Shah; Xiang Xuan; Ron J DeLeeuw; Mehrnoush Khojasteh; Wan L Lam; Raymond Ng; Kevin P Murphy,Abstract Motivation: Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is a pervasivetechnique used to identify chromosomal aberrations in human diseases; including cancer.Aberrations are defined as regions of increased or decreased DNA copy number; relative toa normal sample. Accurately identifying the locations of these aberrations has manyimportant medical applications. Unfortunately; the observed copy number changes are oftencorrupted by various sources of noise; making the boundaries hard to detect. One popularcurrent technique uses hidden Markov models (HMMs) to divide the signal into regions ofconstant copy number called segments; a subsequent classification phase labels eachsegment as a gain; a loss or neutral. Unfortunately; standard HMMs are sensitive to outliers;causing over-segmentation; where segments erroneously span very short regions …,Bioinformatics,2006,131
Finding aggregate proximity relationships and commonalities in spatial data mining,Edwin M Knorr; Raymond T Ng,Studies two spatial knowledge discovery problems involving proximity relationshipsbetween clusters and features. The first problem is: given a cluster of points; how can weefficiently find features (represented as polygons) that are closest to the majority of points inthe cluster? We measure proximity in an aggregate sense due to the nonuniform distributionof points in a cluster (eg houses on a map); and the different shapes and sizes of features(eg natural or man-made geographic features). The second problem is: given n clusters ofpoints; how can we extract the aggregate proximity commonalities (ie features) that apply tomost; if not all; of the n clusters? Regarding the first problem; the main contribution of thepaper is the development of Algorithm CRH (Circle; Rectangle and Hull); which usesgeometric approximations (ie encompassing circles; isothetic rectangles and convex hulls …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1996,128

We applied genome-wide BAC array comparative genomic hybridization to106 diagnostic biopsies of FL to characterize regional genomic imbalances.

Mixed integer programming methods for computing nonmonotonic deductive databases,Colin Bell; Anil Nerode; Raymond T Ng; VS Subrahmanian,Abstract Though the declarative semantics of both explicit and nonmonotonic negation inlogic programs has been studied extensively; relatively little work has been done oncomputation and implementation of these semantics. In this paper; we study three differentapproaches to computing stable models of logic programs based on mixed integer linearprogramming methods for automated deduction introduced by R. Jeroslow. Wesubsequently discuss the relative efficiency of these algorithms. The results of experimentswith a prototype compiler implemented by us tend to confirm our theoretical discussion. Incontrast to resolution; the mixed integer programming methodology is both fully declarativeand handles reuse of old computations gracefully. We also introduce; compare; implement;and experiment with linear constraints corresponding to four semantics for “explicit” …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),1994,107
Stable semantics for probabilistic deductive databases,Raymond Ng; VS Subrahmanian,Abstract In this paper we study the semantics of non-monotonic negation in probabilisticdeductive databases. Based on the stable semantics for classical logic programming; weexamine three natural notions of stability: stable formula functions; stable families ofprobabilistic interpretations; and stable probabilistic models. We show that stable formulafunctions are minimal fixpoints of operators associated with probabilistic logic programs. Wealso prove that each member in a stable family of probabilistic interpretations is aprobabilistic model of the program. Then we show that stable formula functions and stablefamilies behave as duals of each other; tying together elegantly the fixpoint and modeltheories for probabilistic logic programs with negation. Furthermore; since a probabilisticlogic program may not necessarily have a stable family of probabilistic interpretations; we …,Information and computation,1994,107
Semantic compression and pattern extraction with fascicles,HV Jagadish; Jason Madar; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Often many records in a database share similar values for several attributes. If oneis able to identify and group together records that share similar values for some—even if notall—at—tributes; one can both obtain a more parsimo—nious representation of the data; andgain useful insight into the data from a mining perspective. In this paper; we introduce thenotion of fasci-cles. A fascicle F (k; t) is a subset of records that have If compact attributes. Anattribute A of a collection F of records is compact if the width of the range of A—values (fornumeric attributes) or the number of distinct A—values (for categorical attributes) of all therecords in F does not ex—ceed t. We introduce and study two problems re—lated tofascicles. First; we consider how to ﬁnd fascicles such that the total storage of the rela—tionis minimized. Second; we study how best to extract fascicles whose sizes exceed a given …,VLDB,1999,106

Email summarization is a promising way tosolve this problem. In this paper; we propose a new framework for email summarization. Onenovelty is to use a fragment quotation graph to try to capture an email conversation. Thesecond novelty is to use clue words to measure the importance of sentences in conversationsummarization. Based on clue words and their scores; we propose a method called CWS;which is capable of producing a summary of any length as requested by the user. Weprovide a comprehensive comparison of CWS with various existing methods on the Enrondata set. Preliminary results suggest that CWS provides better summaries than existingmethods.,Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web,2007,104
Flexible buffer allocation based on marginal gains,Raymond Ng; Christos Faloutsos; Timos Sellis,Abstract Previous works on buflcx allocation are based f~ il $ lwr exclusively on theavailability of buffers at r {ll) timc or on the access pat teras of queries.

Inference of transcriptional regulation relationships from gene expression data,Andrew T Kwon; Holger H Hoos; Raymond Ng,Abstract We propose a new method for finding potential regulatory relationships betweenpairs of genes from microarray time series data and apply it to expression data for cell-cyclerelated genes in yeast. We compare our algorithm; dubbed the event method; with theearlier correlation method and the edge detection method by Filkov et al. When tested onknown transcriptional regulation genes; all three methods are able to find similar numbers oftrue positives. The results indicate that our algorithm is able to identify true positive pairs thatare different from those found by the two other methods. We also compare the correlationand the event methods using synthetic data and find that typically; the event method obtainsbetter results.,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2003,98

We concentrate on techniques directed towardsonline querying of large; high-dimensional datasets where it is assumed that the total cubehas net been precomputed. The algorithmic space we explore considers trade-offs betweenparallelism; computation and I/0.

Maximizing buffer and disk utilizations for news on-demand,Raymond T Ng; Jinhai Yang,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of how to maximize the throughput of amultimedia system; given a fixed amount of buffer space and disk bandwidth both pm-determined at design-time. Our approach is to maximize the utilizations of disk and buffers.We propose doing so in two ways. First; we analyze a scheme that allows multiple streamsto share buffers. Our analysis and preliminary simulation results indicate that buffer sharingcould lead to as much as 50% reduction in total buffer requirements. Second; we developtwo prefetching strategies: SP and IP. As will be demonstrated by SP; straightforwardprefetching is not effective at all. In contrast; IP; which prefetches more intelligently than doesSP; could be valuable in maximizing the effective use of buffers and disk.

Tobacco smoke exposureis the strongest aetiological factor associated with lung cancer. In this study; using serialanalysis of gene expression (SAGE); we comprehensively examined the effect of activesmoking by comparing the transcriptomes of clinical specimens obtained from current;former and never smokers; and identified genes showing both reversible and irreversibleexpression changes upon smoking cessation. Twenty-four SAGE profiles of the bronchialepithelium of eight current; twelve former and four never smokers were generated andanalyzed. In total; 3;111;471 SAGE tags representing over 110 thousand potentially uniquetranscripts were generated; comprising the largest human SAGE study to date. We identified1;733 constitutively expressed genes in current; former and never smoker transcriptomes …,BMC genomics,2007,87
Modeling recurrent DNA copy number alterations in array CGH data,Sohrab P Shah; Wan L Lam; Raymond T Ng; Kevin P Murphy,Abstract Motivation: Recurrent DNA copy number alterations (CNA) measured with arraycomparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) reveal important molecular features of humangenetics and disease. Studying aCGH profiles from a phenotypic group of individuals candetermine important recurrent CNA patterns that suggest a strong correlation to thephenotype. Computational approaches to detecting recurrent CNAs from a set of aCGHexperiments have typically relied on discretizing the noisy log ratios and subsequentlyinferring patterns. We demonstrate that this can have the effect of filtering out importantsignals present in the raw data. In this article we develop statistical models that jointly inferCNA patterns and the discrete labels by borrowing statistical strength across samples.Results: We propose extending single sample aCGH HMMs to the multiple sample case …,Bioinformatics,2007,84
Evaluating multidimensional indexing structures for images transformed by principal component analysis,Raymond T Ng; Andishe Sedighian,Content-based retrieval in image management systems requires indexing of image featurevectors. Most feature vectors have a high number of dimensions (15+). This makes indexingdifficult since most existing multi-dimensional indexing structures grow exponentially in sizeas dimensions increase. We approach this problem in three stages:(1) reduce thedimensionality of the feature space;(2) evaluate existing multi-dimensional indexingstructures to determine which one can best organize the reduced feature space; and (3)customize the selected structure to improve search performance. To reduce thedimensionality of the feature space without losing much information we apply a statisticaltechnique called principal component analysis (PCA); using Turk and Pentland'seigenimages approach. We then conduct a comparative analysis of a wide range of …,Storage and Retrieval for Still Image and Video Databases IV,1996,83
Efficient dynamic mining of constrained frequent sets,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Carson Kai-Sang Leung; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Data mining is supposed to be an iterative and exploratory process. In this context;we are working on a project with the overall objective of developing a practical computingenvironment for the human-centered exploratory mining of frequent sets. One criticalcomponent of such an environment is the support for the dynamic mining of constrainedfrequent sets of items. Constraints enable users to impose a certain focus on the miningprocess; dynamic means that; in the middle of the computation; users are able to (i) change(such as tighten or relax) the constraints and/or (ii) change the minimum support threshold;thus having a decisive influence on subsequent computations. In a real-life situation; theavailable buffer space may be limited; thus adding another complication to the problem. Inthis article; we develop an algorithm; called DCF; for Dynamic Constrained Frequent-set …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2003,80

Exploiting succinct constraints using FP-trees,Carson Kai-Sang Leung; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Since its introduction; frequent-set mining has been generalized to many forms;which include constrained data mining. The use of constraints permits user focus andguidance; enables user exploration and control; and leads to effective pruning of the searchspace and efficient mining of frequent itemsets. In this paper; we focus on the use of succinctconstraints. In particular; we propose a novel algorithm called FPS to mine frequent itemsetssatisfying succinct constraints. The FPS algorithm avoids the generate-and-test paradigm byexploiting succinctness properties of the constraints in a FP-tree based framework. In termsof functionality; our algorithm is capable of handling not just the succinct aggregateconstraint; but any succinct constraint in general. Moreover; it handles multiple succinctconstraints. In terms of performance; our algorithm is more efficient and effective than …,ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter,2002,76
Combining intra-and multi-sentential rhetorical parsing for document-level discourse analysis,Shafiq Joty; Giuseppe Carenini; Raymond Ng; Yashar Mehdad,Abstract We propose a novel approach for developing a two-stage document-leveldiscourse parser. Our parser builds a discourse tree by applying an optimal parsingalgorithm to probabilities inferred from two Conditional Random Fields: one forintrasentential parsing and the other for multisentential parsing. We present two approachesto combine these two stages of discourse parsing effectively. A set of empirical evaluationsover two different datasets demonstrates that our discourse parser significantly outperformsthe stateof-the-art; often by a wide margin.,Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers),2013,74

Plasma biomarkers may offer an importantoption for post-transplant monitoring and permit timely and effective therapeutic interventionto minimize graft damage. This case-control discovery study (n= 32) used isobaric taggingfor relative and absolute protein quantification (iTRAQ) technology to quantitate plasmaprotein relative concentrations in precise cohorts of patients with and without biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (BCAR).

Substring selectivity estimation,HV Jagadish; Raymond T Ng; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract With the explosion of the Internet; LDAP directories and XML; there is an evergreater need to evaluate queries involving (sub) string matching. Effective queryoptimization in this context requires good selectivity estimates. In this paper; we use prunedcount-suffix trees as the basic framework for substring selectivity estimation. We present anovel technique to obtain a good estimate for a given substring matching query; called MO(for Maximal Overlap); that estimates the selectivity of a query based on all maximalsubstrings of the query in the pruned count-suffix tree. We show that MO is provably betterthan the (independence-based) substring selectivity estimation technique proposed byKrishnan et al.[6]; called KVI; under the natural assumption that strings exhibit the so-called“short memory” property. We complement our analysis with an experiment; using a real …,Proceedings of the eighteenth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1999,74
Long non-coding RNAs are expressed in oral mucosa and altered in oral premalignant lesions,Ewan A Gibb; Katey SS Enfield; Greg L Stewart; Kim M Lonergan; Raj Chari; Raymond T Ng; Lewei Zhang; Calum E MacAulay; Miriam P Rosin; Wan L Lam,Summary Oral epithelial dysplasias are believed to progress through a series ofhistopathological stages; from mild to severe dysplasia; to carcinoma in situ; and finally toinvasive OSCC. Underlying this change in histopathological grade are gross chromosomealterations and changes in gene expression of both protein-coding genes and non-codingRNAs. Recent papers have described associations of aberrant expression of microRNAs;one class of non-coding RNAs; with oral cancer. However; expression profiling of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has not been reported. Long non-coding RNAs are a novel class ofmRNA-like transcripts with no protein coding capacity; but with a variety of functionsincluding roles in epigenetics and gene regulation. In recent reports; the aberrantexpression of lncRNAs has been associated with human cancers; suggesting a critical …,Oral oncology,2011,72
The 3w model and algebra for unified data mining,Theodore Johnson; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Real data mining analysis applications call for a framework which adequatelysupports knowledge discovery as a multi-step process; where the input of one miningoperation can be the output of another. Previous studies; primarily focusing on fastcomputation of one specific mining task at a time; ignore this vital issue. Motivated by thisobservation; we develop a unified model supporting all major mining and analysis tasks. Ourmodel consists of three distinct worlds; corresponding to intensional and extensionaldimensions; and to data sets. The notion of dimension is a centerpiece of the model.Equipped with hierarchies; dimensions integrate the output of seemingly dissimilar miningand analysis operations in a clean manner. We propose an algebra; called the dimensionalgebra; for manipulating intensional dimensions; as well as operators that serve as …,VLDB,2000,71
Flexible and adaptable buffer management techniques for database management systems,Christos Faloutsos; Raymond Ng; Timos Sellis,The problem of buffer management in database management systems is concerned with theefficient main memory allocation and management for answering database queries.Previous works on buffer allocation are based either exclusively on the availability of buffersat runtime or on the access patterns of queries. In this paper; we first propose a unifiedapproach for buffer allocation in which both of these considerations are taken into account.Our approach is based on the notion of marginal gains which specify the expected reductionin page faults by allocating extra buffers to a query. Then; we extend this approach tosupport adaptable buffer allocation. An adaptable buffer allocation algorithm automaticallyoptimizes itself for the specific query workload. To achieve this adaptability; we proposeusing runtime information; such as the load of the system; in buffer allocation decisions …,IEEE Transactions on Computers,1995,71
A unified approach for mining outliers,Edwin M Knorr; Raymond T Ng,Abstract This paper deals with finding outliers (exceptions) in large datasets. Theidentification of outliers can often lead to the discovery of truly unexpected knowledge inareas such as electronic commerce; credit card fraud; and even the analysis of performancestatistics of professional athletes. One contribution of this paper is to show how ourproposed; intuitive notion of outliers can unify or generalize many of the existing notions ofoutliers provided by discordancy tests for standard statistical distributions. Thus; whenmining large datasets containing many attributes; a unified approach can replace manystatistical discordancy tests; regardless of any knowledge about the underlying distributionof the attributes. A second contribution of this paper is the development of an algorithm tofind all outliers in a dataset. An important advantage of this algorithm is that its time …,Proceedings of the 1997 conference of the Centre for Advanced Studies on Collaborative research,1997,69
An extendible hash for multi-precision similarity querying of image databases,Shu Lin; M Tamer Ozsu; Vincent Oria; Raymond Ng,Abstract We propose multi-precision similarity matching where the image is divided into anumber of subblocks; each with its associated color histogram. We present experimentalresults showing that the spatial distribution information recorded by multiprecision colorhistograms helps to make similarity matching more precise. We also show that sub-imagequeries are much better supported with multi-precision color histograms. To minimize theoverhead; we employ a filtering scheme based on the 3-dimensional average color vectors.We provide a formal result proving that filtering with multi-precision color histograms iscomplete. Finally; we develop a novel extendible hashing structure for indexing the averagecolor vectors. We give experimental results showing that the proposed structure significantlyoutperforms the SR-tree.,VLDB,2001,66
Extending q-grams to estimate selectivity of string matching with low edit distance,Hongrae Lee; Raymond T Ng; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract There are many emerging database applications that require accurate selectivityestimation of approximate string matching queries. Edit distance is one of the mostcommonly used string similarity measures. In this paper; we study the problem of estimatingselectivity of string matching with low edit distance. Our framework is based on extending q-grams with wildcards. Based on the concepts of replacement semi-lattice; string hierarchyand a combinatorial analysis; we develop the formulas for selectivity estimation and providethe algorithm BasicEQ. We next develop the algorithm Opt EQ by enhancing BasicEQ withtwo novel improvements. Finally we show a comprehensive set of experiments using threebenchmarks comparing Opt EQ with the state-of-the-art method SEPIA. Our experimentalresults show that Opt EQ delivers more accurate selectivity estimations.,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,63
Interactive multimedia summaries of evaluative text,Giuseppe Carenini; Raymond T Ng; Adam Pauls,Abstract We present an interactive multimedia interface for automatically summarizing largecorpora of evaluative text (eg online product reviews). We rely on existing techniques forextracting knowledge from the corpora but present a novel approach for conveying thatknowledge to the user. Our system presents the extracted knowledge in a hierarchicalvisualization mode as well as in a natural language summary. We propose a method forreasoning about the extracted knowledge so that the natural language summary can includeonly the most important information from the corpus. Our approach is interactive in that itallows the user to explore in the original dataset through intuitive visual and textual methods.Results of a formative evaluation of our interface show general satisfaction among userswith our approach.,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Intelligent user interfaces,2006,63
Parametric query optimization,Yannis E Ioannidis; Raymond T Ng; Kyuseok Shim; Timos K Sellis,Abstract. In most database systems; the values of many important run-time parameters of thesystem; the data; or the query are unknown at query optimization time. Parametric queryoptimization attempts to identify at compile time several execution plans; each one of whichis optimal for a subset of all possible values of the run-time parameters. The goal is that atrun time; when the actual parameter values are known; the appropriate plan should beidentifiable with essentially no overhead. We present a general formulation of this problemand study it primarily for the buffer size parameter. We adopt randomized algorithms as themain approach to this style of optimization and enhance them with a sideways informationpassing feature that increases their effectiveness in the new task. Experimental results ofthese enhanced algorithms show that they optimize queries for large numbers of buffer …,The VLDB Journal,1997,61
Summarizing emails with conversational cohesion and subjectivity,Giuseppe Carenini; Raymond T Ng; Xiaodong Zhou,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of summarizing email conversations. We firstbuild a sentence quotation graph that captures the conversation structure among emails. Weadopt three cohesion measures: clue words; semantic similarity and cosine similarity as theweight of the edges. Second; we use two graph-based summarization approaches;Generalized ClueWordSummarizer and Page-Rank; to extract sentences as summaries.Third; we propose a summarization approach based on subjective opinions and integrate itwith the graph-based ones. The empirical evaluation shows that the basic clue words havethe highest accuracy among the three cohesion measures. Moreover; subjective words cansignificantly improve accuracy.,Proceedings of ACL-08: HLT,2008,58
The generalized MDL approach for summarization,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond T Ng; Christine Xing Wang; Xiaodong Zhou; Theodore J Johnson,This chapter presents a generalization of the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle;called GMDL; and shows that GMDL leads to fewer regions than MDL; and hence moreconcise “answers” are returned to the user. The key idea is that a region may contain “don'tcare” cells (up to a global maximum) if these “don't care” cells help to form bigger summaryregions; leading to a more concise overall summary. There are many applications in onlineanalytical processing (OLAP) and data analysis where one identifies regions of interest. Forexample; in OLAP; an analysis query involving aggregate sales performance of variousproducts in different locations and seasons could help identify interesting cells; such as cellsof a data cube having an aggregate sales higher than a threshold. While a normal answer tosuch a query merely returns all interesting cells; it may be far more informative to the user …,*,2002,57
An analysis of buffer sharing and prefetching techniques for multimedia systems,Raymond T Ng; Jinhai Yang,Abstract In this paper; we study the problem of how to maximize the throughput of acontinuous-media system; given fixed amounts of buffer space and disk bandwidth bothpredetermined at design time. Our approach is to maximize the utilizations of disk andbuffers. We propose doing so in two ways. First; we analyze a scheme that allows multiplestreams to share buffers. Our analysis and preliminary simulation results indicate that buffersharing could lead to as much as 50% reduction in total buffer requirement. Second; wedevelop three prefetching strategies: SP; IP1 and IP2. As demonstrated by SP;straightforward prefetching is not effective at all. In contrast; IP1 and IP2; which prefetchmore intelligently than does SP; could be valuable in maximizing the effective use of buffersand disk. Our preliminary simulation results show that IP1 and IP2 could lead to a 40 …,Multimedia Systems,1996,56
Detecting potential labeling errors in microarrays by data perturbation,Andrea Malossini; Enrico Blanzieri; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Motivation: Classification is widely used in medical applications. However; thequality of the classifier depends critically on the accurate labeling of the training data. But formany medical applications; labeling a sample or grading a biopsy can be subjective.Existing studies confirm this phenomenon and show that even a very small number ofmislabeled samples could deeply degrade the performance of the obtained classifier;particularly when the sample size is small. The problem we address in this paper is todevelop a method for automatically detecting samples that are possibly mislabeled. Results:We propose two algorithms; a classification-stability algorithm and a leave-one-out-error-sensitivity algorithm for detecting possibly mislabeled samples. For both algorithms; the keystructure is the computation of the leave-one-out perturbation matrix. The classification …,Bioinformatics,2006,53
Sindbad: a location-based social networking system,Mohamed Sarwat; Jie Bao; Ahmed Eldawy; Justin J Levandoski; Amr Magdy; Mohamed F Mokbel,Abstract This demo presents Sindbad; a location-based social networking system. Sindbadsupports three new services beyond traditional social networking services; namely; location-aware news feed; location-aware recommender; and location-aware ranking. These newservices not only consider social relevance for its users; but they also consider spatialrelevance. Since location-aware social networking systems have to deal with large numberof users; large number of messages; and user mobility; efficiency and scalability areimportant issues. To this end; Sindbad encapsulates its three main services inside the queryprocessing engine of PostgreSQL. Usage and internal functionality of Sindbad; implementedwith PostgreSQL and Google Maps API; are demonstrated through user (ie; web/phone) andsystem analyzer GUI interfaces; respectively.,Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2012,52
Robust space transformations for distance-based operations,Edwin M Knorr; Raymond T Ng; Ruben H Zamar,Abstract For many KDD operations; such as nearest neighbor search; distance-basedclustering; and outlier detection; there is an underlying &kgr;-D data space in which eachtuple/object is represented as a point in the space. In the presence of differing scales;variability; correlation; and/or outliers; we may get unintuitive results if an inappropriatespace is used. The fundamental question that this paper addresses is:" What then is anappropriate space?" We propose using a robust space transformation called the Donoho-Stahel estimator. In the first half of the paper; we show the key properties of the estimator. Ofparticular importance to KDD applications involving databases is the stability property; whichsays that in spite of frequent updates; the estimator does not:(a) change much;(b) lose itsusefulness; or (c) require re-computation. In the second half; we focus on the computation …,Proceedings of the seventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2001,52
Implementing stable semantics by linear programming,Colin Bell; Anil Nerode; Raymond Ng; VS Subrahmanian,In recent years; there has been great interest in the semantics of logic programs that containnon-monotonic modes of negation. Though a great deal of work has been done on thedeclarative semantics of logic programs containing negation; relatively little effort has beenexpended on issues relating to the computation and implementation of non-monotonic logicprogramming semantics. In this paper; we develop; and implement; bottom-up computationtechniques for computing the set of all stable models of a functionfree logic program P.Existing and past generations of Prolog systems have left deduction to run-time; and thismay account for the relatively poor run-time performance of such systems.

Itcompress: An iterative semantic compression algorithm,HV Jagadish; Raymond T Ng; Beng Chin Ooi; Anthony KH Tung,Real datasets are often large enough to necessitate data compression. Traditional'syntactic'data compression methods treat the table as a large byte string and operate at the byte level.The tradeoff in such cases is usually between the ease of retrieval (the ease with which onecan retrieve a single tuple or attribute value without decompressing a much larger unit) andthe effectiveness of the compression. In this regard; the use of semantic compression hasgenerated considerable interest and motivated certain recent works. We propose a semanticcompression algorithm called ItCompress ITerative Compression; which achieves goodcompression while permitting access even at attribute level without requiring thedecompression of a larger unit. ItCompress iteratively improves the compression ratio of thecompressed output during each scan of the table. The amount of compression can be …,Data Engineering; 2004.

Identification of novel lung genes in bronchial epithelium by serial analysis of gene expression,Kim M Lonergan; Raj Chari; Ronald J Deleeuw; Ashleen Shadeo; Bryan Chi; Ming-Sound Tsao; Steven Jones; Marco Marra; Victor Ling; Raymond Ng; Calum MacAulay; Stephen Lam; Wan L Lam,A description of the transcriptome of human bronchial epithelium should provide a basis forstudying lung diseases; including cancer. We have deduced global gene expression profilesof bronchial epithelium and lung parenchyma; based on a vast dataset of nearly two millionsequence tags from 21 serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) libraries from individualswith a history of smoking. Our analysis suggests that the transcriptome of the bronchialepithelium is distinct from that of lung parenchyma and other tissue types. Moreover; ouranalysis has identified novel bronchial-enriched genes such as MS4A8B; and hasdemonstrated the use of SAGE for the discovery of novel transcript variants. Significantly;gene expression associated with ciliogenesis is evident in bronchial epithelium; andincludes the expression of transcripts specifying axonemal proteins DNAI2; SPAG6; ASP …,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,2006,50
SQUIRE: Sequential pattern mining with quantities,Chulyun Kim; Jong-Hwa Lim; Raymond T Ng; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Discovering sequential patterns is an important problem for many applications.Existing algorithms find qualitative sequential patterns in the sense that only items areincluded in the patterns. However; for many applications; such as business and scientificapplications; quantitative attributes are often recorded in the data; which are ignored byexisting algorithms. Quantity information included in the mined sequential patterns canprovide useful insight to the users. In this paper; we consider the problem of miningsequential patterns with quantities. We demonstrate that naive extensions to existingalgorithms for sequential patterns are inefficient; as they may enumerate the search spaceblindly. To alleviate the situation; we propose hash filtering and quantity samplingtechniques that significantly improve the performance of the naive extensions …,Journal of Systems and Software,2007,48
Exploratory mining via constrained frequent set queries,Raymond Ng; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Jiawei Han; Teresa Mah,Abstract Although there have been many studies on data mining; to date there have beenfew research prototypes or commercial systems supporting comprehensive query-drivenmining; which encourages interactive exploration of the data. Our thesis is that constraintconstructs and the optimization they induce play a pivotal role in mining queries; thussubstantially enhancing the usefulness and performance of the mining system. This is basedon the analogy of declarative query languages like SQL and query optimization which havemade relational databases so successful. To this end; our proposed demo is not yet anotherdata mining system; but of a new paradigm in data mining-mining with constraints; as theimportant first step towards supporting ad-hoc mining in DBMS. In this demo; we will show aprototype exploratory mining system that implements constraint-based mining query …,ACM SIGMOD Record,1999,48
Implementing deductive databases by linear programming,Colin Bell; Anil Nerode; Raymond T Ng; VS Subrahmanian,Logic programs incorporate forms of SLD resolution as the basis for query processing.Existing and past generations of Prolog systems have left deduction to run-time; and thismay account for the poor runtime performance of such systems. Our work tries to minimizerun-time deduction by shifting the deductive process to compile-time; not run-time. Thisapproach fits into the bottom-up computation paradigm that has been studied by manyresearchers like Bancilhon; Beeri; Ramakrishnan and Unman[1; 2; 3; 19]. At least two ofthese paradigms have been implemented: the LDL system at MCC; developed by Zanioloand his group [l $]; and the NAIL system[15] at Stanford. One major difference between ourapproach and the bottom-up approaches developed thus far is that we rely on mixed integerlinear programming techniques for computing deductive databases that may contain …,Proceedings of the eleventh ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1992,47
Method for using query templates in directory caches,*,The present invention discloses the use of generalized queries; referred to as querytemplates; obtained by generalizing individual user queries; as the semantic basis for lowoverhead; high benefit directory caches for handling declarative queries. Cachingeffectiveness can be improved by maintaining a set of generalizations of queries andadmitting such generalizations into the cache when their estimated benefits are sufficientlyhigh. In a preferred embodiment of the invention; the admission of query templates into thecache can be done in what is referred to by the inventors as a “revolutionary” fashion—followed by stable periods where cache admission and replacement can be doneincrementally in an evolutionary fashion. The present invention can lead to considerablyhigher hit rates and lower server-side execution and communication costs than …,*,2005,45

To do or not to do: the dilemma of disclosing anonymized data,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond T Ng; Ganesh Ramesh,Abstract Decision makers of companies often face the dilemma of whether to release datafor knowledge discovery; vis a vis the risk of disclosing proprietary or sensitive information.While there are various" sanitization" methods; in this paper we focus on anonymization;given its widespread use in practice. We give due diligence to the question of" just how safethe anonymized data is"; in terms of protecting the true identities of the data objects. Weconsider both the scenarios when the hacker has no information; and more realistically;when the hacker may have partial information about items in the domain. We conduct ouranalyses in the context of frequent set mining. We propose to capture the prior knowledge ofthe hacker by means of a belief function; where an educated guess of the frequency of eachitem is assumed. For various classes of belief functions; which correspond to different …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2005,44

Searching for dependencies at multiple abstraction levels,Toon Calders; Raymond T Ng; Jef Wijsen,Abstract The notion of roll-up dependency (RUD) extends functional dependencies withgeneralization hierarchies. RUDs can be applied in OLAP and database design. Theproblem of discovering RUDs in large databases is at the center of this paper. An algorithmis provided that relies on a number of theoretical results. The algorithm has beenimplemented; results on two real-life datasets are given. The extension of functionaldependency (FD) with roll-ups turns out to capture meaningful rules that are outside thescope of classical FD mining.

Hierarchical cluster analysis of SAGE data for cancer profiling,Raymond T Ng; Jörg Sander; Monica C Sleumer,Abstract In this paper we present a method for clustering SAGE (Serial Analysis of GeneExpression) data to detect similarities and dissimilarities between different types of canceron the sub-cellular level. The data; however; is extremely high dimensional; and due to themethod of measurement; there are many errors as well as missing values in the data;challenging any clustering algorithm. Therefore; we introduce special pre-processingtechniques to reduce these errors and to restore missing data. These techniques are tailoredto the process that generates the data; making only very conservative changes. Furthermore;we present a new subspace selection technique to identify a relevant subset of attributes(genes) using the Wilcoxon test. This is a general technique that can be applied to selectsubspaces for the purpose of clustering whenever some high-level categories of interest …,Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Data Mining in Bioinformatics,2001,42
Abstractive summarization of product reviews using discourse structure,Shima Gerani; Yashar Mehdad; Giuseppe Carenini; Raymond T Ng; Bita Nejat,Abstract We propose a novel abstractive summarization system for product reviews by takingadvantage of their discourse structure. First; we apply a discourse parser to each review andobtain a discourse tree representation for every review. We then modify the discourse treessuch that every leaf node only contains the aspect words. Second; we aggregate the aspectdiscourse trees and generate a graph. We then select a subgraph representing the mostimportant aspects and the rhetorical relations between them using a PageRank algorithm;and transform the selected subgraph into an aspect tree. Finally; we generate a naturallanguage summary by applying a template-based NLG framework. Quantitative andqualitative analysis of the results; based on two user studies; show that our approachsignificantly outperforms extractive and abstractive baselines.,Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP),2014,41
A sequence-based approach to identify reference genes for gene expression analysis,Raj Chari; Kim M Lonergan; Larissa A Pikor; Bradley P Coe; Chang Qi Zhu; Timothy HW Chan; Calum E MacAulay; Ming-Sound Tsao; Stephen Lam; Raymond T Ng; Wan L Lam,An important consideration when analyzing both microarray and quantitative PCRexpression data is the selection of appropriate genes as endogenous controls or referencegenes. This step is especially critical when identifying genes differentially expressedbetween datasets. Moreover; reference genes suitable in one context (eg lung cancer) maynot be suitable in another (eg breast cancer). Currently; the main approach to identifyreference genes involves the mining of expression microarray data for highly expressed andrelatively constant transcripts across a sample set. A caveat here is the requirement fortranscript normalization prior to analysis; and measurements obtained are relative; notabsolute. Alternatively; as sequencing-based technologies provide digital quantitativeoutput; absolute quantification ensues; and reference gene identification becomes more …,BMC medical genomics,2010,41
Genomic imbalances in precancerous tissues signal oral cancer risk,Cathie Garnis; Raj Chari; Timon PH Buys; Lewei Zhang; Raymond T Ng; Miriam P Rosin; Wan L Lam,Oral cancer develops through a series of histopathological stages: through mild (low grade);moderate; and severe (high grade) dysplasia to carcinoma in situ and then invasive disease.Early detection of those oral premalignant lesions (OPLs) that will develop into invasivetumors is necessary to improve the poor prognosis of oral cancer. Because no tools exist fordelineating progression risk in low grade oral lesions; we cannot determine which of thesecases require aggressive intervention. We undertook whole genome analysis by tiling-patharray comparative genomic hybridization for a rare panel of early and late stage OPLs (n=62); all of which had extensive longitudinal follow up (> 10 years). Genome profiles for oralsquamous cell carcinomas (n= 24) were generated for comparison. Parallel analysis ofgenome alterations and clinical parameters was performed to identify features associated …,Molecular cancer,2009,41

Multiple aberrations of chromosome 3p detected in oral premalignant lesions,Ivy FL Tsui; Miriam P Rosin; Lewei Zhang; Raymond T Ng; Wan L Lam,The study of oral premalignant lesions (OPL) is crucial to the identification of initiatinggenetic events in oral cancer. However; these lesions are minute in size; making it achallenge to recover sufficient DNA from microdissected cells for comprehensive genomicanalysis. As a step toward identifying genetic aberrations associated with oral cancerprogression; we used tiling-path array comparative genomic hybridization to comparealterations on chromosome 3p for 71 OPLs against 23 oral squamous cell carcinomas. 3pwas chosen because although it is frequently altered in oral cancers and has beenassociated with progression risk; its alteration status has only been evaluated at a smallnumber of loci in OPLs. We identified six recurrent losses in this region that were sharedbetween high-grade dysplasias and oral squamous cell carcinomas; including a 2.89 …,Cancer Prevention Research,2008,39
Discriminative features for identifying and interpreting outliers,Xuan Hong Dang; Ira Assent; Raymond T Ng; Arthur Zimek; Erich Schubert,We consider the problem of outlier detection and interpretation. While most existing studiesfocus on the first problem; we simultaneously address the equally important challenge ofoutlier interpretation. We propose an algorithm that uncovers outliers in subspaces ofreduced dimensionality in which they are well discriminated from regular objects while at thesame time retaining the natural local structure of the original data to ensure the quality ofoutlier explanation. Our algorithm takes a mathematically appealing approach from thespectral graph embedding theory and we show that it achieves the globally optimal solutionfor the objective of subspace learning. By using a number of real-world datasets; wedemonstrate its appealing performance not only wrt the outlier detection rate but also wrt thediscriminative human-interpretable features. This is the first approach to exploit …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,38
Computing circumscriptive databases: I. theory and algorithms,Anil Nerode; Raymond T Ng; VS Subrahmanian,Abstract Though circumscription was introduced by McCarthy over a decade ago; there hasbeen relatively little work on algorithms for computing circumscriptive databases. In thispaper; we develop algorithms to compute the preferred models of circumscriptive databasesat compile-time using mixed integer linear programming techniques. Two advantages of this(bottom-up) approach are that it makes efficient re-use of previous computations and itprovides much faster run-time performance. Some other advantages of using linearprogramming to automate deduction at compile time are that its re-optimization facilitieselegantly accommodate database updates and also that it leads to a completely declarativeformulation in which ordering of rules and literals in rule bodies plays no real role. Finally;we plan to use a standard relational database system as our run-time environment; this …,Information and Computation,1995,38
Methods for mining and summarizing text conversations,Giuseppe Carenini; Gabriel Murray; Raymond Ng,Abstract Due to the Internet Revolution; human conversational data--in written forms--areaccumulating at a phenomenal rate. At the same time; improvements in speech technologyenable many spoken conversations to be transcribed. Individuals and organizations engagein email exchanges; face-to-face meetings; blogging; texting and other social mediaactivities. The advances in natural language processing provide ample opportunities forthese" informal documents" to be analyzed and mined; thus creating numerous new andvaluable applications. This book presents a set of computational methods to extractinformation from conversational data; and to provide natural language summaries of thedata. The book begins with an overview of basic concepts; such as the differences betweenextractive and abstractive summaries; and metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of …,Synthesis Lectures on Data Management,2011,36
Whole blood genomic biomarkers of acute cardiac allograft rejection,David Lin; Zsuzsanna Hollander; Raymond T Ng; Carol Imai; Andrew Ignaszewski; Robert Balshaw; Gabriela Cohen Freue; Janet E Wilson-McManus; Pooran Qasimi; Anna Meredith; Alice Mui; Tim Triche; Robert McMaster; Paul A Keown; Bruce M McManus,Background Significant progress has been made in cardiac transplantation over the past 30years; however; the means for detection of acute cardiac allograft rejection remains in needof improvement. At present; the endomyocardial biopsy; an invasive and inconvenientprocedure for patients; is required for the surveillance and diagnosis of acute cardiacallograft rejection. In the Biomarkers in Transplantation initiative; we investigated geneexpression profiles in peripheral blood of cardiac transplant subjects as potential biomarkersfor diagnosis of allograft rejection. Methods Whole blood samples were obtained from 28cardiac transplant subjects who consented to the study. Serial samples were collected frompre-transplant through 3 years post-transplant according to the standard protocol.Temporally correspondent biopsies were also collected; reviewed in a blinded manner …,The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation,2009,36
Multi-dimensional substring selectivity estimation,HV Jagadish; Olga Kapitskaia; Raymond T Ng; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract With the explosion of the Internet; LDAP directories and XML; there is an evergreater need to evaluate queries involving (sub) string matching. In many cases; matchesneed to be on multiple attributes/dimensions; with correlations between the dimensions.Effective query optimization in this context requires good selectivity estimates. In this paper;we use multi-dimensional countsuffix trees as the basic framework for substring selectivityestimation. Given the enormous size ofthese trees for large databases; we develop a spaceand time efficient probabilistic algorithm to construct multi-dimensional pruned count-suffixtrees directly. We then present two techniques to obtain good estimates for a given multi-dimensional substring matching query; using a pruned countsuffix tree. The first one; calledGNO (for Greedy Non-Overlap); generalizes the greedy parsing suggested by Krishnan et …,VLDB,1999,36
Codra: A novel discriminative framework for rhetorical analysis,Shafiq Joty; Giuseppe Carenini; Raymond T Ng,Clauses and sentences rarely stand on their own in an actual discourse; rather; therelationship between them carries important information that allows the discourse to expressa meaning as a whole beyond the sum of its individual parts. Rhetorical analysis seeks touncover this coherence structure. In this article; we present CODRA—a COmpleteprobabilistic Discriminative framework for performing Rhetorical Analysis in accordance withRhetorical Structure Theory; which posits a tree representation of a discourse. CODRAcomprises a discourse segmenter and a discourse parser. First; the discourse segmenter;which is based on a binary classifier; identifies the elementary discourse units in a giventext. Then the discourse parser builds a discourse tree by applying an optimal parsingalgorithm to probabilities inferred from two Conditional Random Fields: one for intra …,Computational Linguistics,2015,35
Semantic role labeling with neural network factors,Nicholas FitzGerald; Oscar Täckström; Kuzman Ganchev; Dipanjan Das,Abstract We present a new method for semantic role labeling in which arguments andsemantic roles are jointly embedded in a shared vector space for a given predicate. Theseembeddings belong to a neural network; whose output represents the potential functions ofa graphical model designed for the SRL task. We consider both local and structured learningmethods and obtain strong results on standard PropBank and FrameNet corpora with astraightforward product-of-experts model. We further show how the model can learn jointlyfrom PropBank and FrameNet annotations to obtain additional improvements on the smallerFrameNet dataset.,Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2015,35
Molecular signatures of end-stage heart failure,David Lin; Zsuzsanna Hollander; Anna Meredith; Ellamae Stadnick; Mayu Sasaki; Gabriela Cohen Freue; Pooran Qasimi; Alice Mui; Raymond T Ng; Robert Balshaw; Janet E Wilson-McManus; David Wishart; David Hau; Paul A Keown; Robert McMaster; Bruce M McManus,Abstract Background To date; gene expression studies related to chronic heart failure (CHF)have mainly involved microarray analysis of myocardial tissues. The potential utility of bloodto infer the etiology; pathogenesis; and course of CHF remains unclear. Further; the use ofproteomic and metabolomic platforms for molecular profiling of CHF is relatively unexplored.Methods Microarray genomic; iTRAQ proteomic; and nuclear magnetic resonancemetabolomic analyses were carried out on blood samples from 29 end-stage CHF patients(16 ischemic heart disease [IHD]; 13 nonischemic cardiomyopathy [NICM]); and 20 normalcardiac function (NCF) controls. Robust statistical tests and bioinformatical tools wereapplied to identify and compare the molecular signatures among these subject groups.Results No genes or proteins; and only two metabolites; were differentially expressed …,Journal of cardiac failure,2011,35
Functional genomic analysis of peripheral blood during early acute renal allograft rejection,Oliver P Günther; Robert F Balshaw; Andreas Scherer; Zsuzsanna Hollander; Alice Mui; Timothy J Triche; Gabriela Cohen Freue; Guiyun Li; Raymond T Ng; Janet Wilson-McManus; W Robert McMaster; Bruce M McManus; Paul A Keown,Background. Acute graft rejection is an important clinical problem in renal transplantationand an adverse predictor for long-term graft survival. Peripheral blood biomarkers thatprovide evidence of early graft rejection may offer an important option for posttransplantmonitoring; optimize the utility of graft biopsy; and permit timely and effective therapeuticintervention to minimize the graft damage. Methods. In this feasibility study (n= 58); we haveused gene expression profiling in a case-control design to compare whole blood samplesbetween normal subjects (n= 20) and patients with (n= 11) or without (n= 22) biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (BCAR) or borderline changes (n= 5). Results. A total of 183 probesets representing 160 genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate [FDR]< 0.01)between subjects with or without BCAR; from which linear discriminant analysis and cross …,Transplantation,2009,35
Expressive power of an algebra for data mining,Toon Calders; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond T Ng; Jan Paredaens,Abstract The relational data model has simple and clear foundations on which significanttheoretical and systems research has flourished. By contrast; most research on data mininghas focused on algorithmic issues. A major open question is: what's an appropriatefoundation for data mining; which can accommodate disparate mining tasks&quest; Weaddress this problem by presenting a database model and an algebra for data mining. Thedatabase model is based on the 3W-model introduced by Johnson et al.[2000]. This modelrelied on black box mining operators. A main contribution of this article is to open up theseblack boxes; by using generic operators in a data mining algebra. Two key operators in thisalgebra are regionize; which creates regions (or models) from data tuples; and a restrictedform of looping called mining loop. Then the resulting data mining algebra MA is studied …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2006,33
Outliers and data mining: finding exceptions in data,Edwin M Knorr,Description Our thesis is that we can efficiently identify meaningful outliers in large;multidimensional datasets. In particular; we introduce and study the notion and utility ofdistance-based outliers (DB-outliers). First; we focus on outlier identification; and presentnested-loop; index-based; and cell-based algorithms. For datasets that are mainly disk-resident; we present another version of the cell-based algorithm that guarantees at most 3passes over a dataset. We provide experimental results showing that these cell-basedalgorithms are by far the best for 4 or fewer dimensions. Second; we focus on thecomputation of intensional knowledge; that is; we provide a description or an explanation ofwhy an identified outlier is exceptional. We provide an algorithm to compute the" strongest"outliers in a dataset (ie; outliers that are dominant for certain attributes or dimensions) …,*,2002,33
Ten-year trends in direct costs of COPD: a population-based study,Amir Khakban; Don D Sin; J Mark FitzGerald; Raymond Ng; Zafar Zafari; Bruce McManus; Zsuzsanna Hollander; Carlo A Marra; Mohsen Sadatsafavi,BACKGROUND Up-to-date estimates of burden of diseases are required for evidence-based decision-making. The objectives of this study were to determine the excess costs ofCOPD and its trend from 2001 to 2010 in British Columbia; Canada. METHODS We usedBritish Columbia's administrative health data to construct a cohort of patients with COPD anda matched comparison cohort of subjects without COPD. We followed each patient from thetime of first COPD-related health-care event (or equivalent time for the comparison cohort).Direct medical costs (in 2010 Canadian dollars [$]) were calculated based on billing recordspertaining to hospital admissions; outpatient services use; medication dispensations; andcommunity care services. We determined the excess medical costs of COPD by calculatingthe difference in overall medical costs between the COPD and the comparison cohorts …,Chest,2015,32
Explaining outliers by subspace separability,Barbora Micenková; Xuan-Hong Dang; Ira Assent; Raymond T Ng,Outliers are extraordinary objects in a data collection. Depending on the domain; they mayrepresent errors; fraudulent activities or rare events that are subject of our interest. Existingapproaches focus on detection of outliers or degrees of outlierness (ranking); but do notprovide a possible explanation of how these objects deviate from the rest of the data. Suchexplanations would help user to interpret or validate the detected outliers. The problemaddressed in this paper is as follows: given an outlier detected by an existing algorithm; wepropose a method that determines possible explanations for the outlier. These explanationsare expressed in the form of subspaces in which the given outlier shows separability fromthe inliers. In this manner; our proposed method complements existing outlier detectionalgorithms by providing additional information about the outliers. Our method is designed …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on,2013,32
Topic segmentation and labeling in asynchronous conversations,Shafiq Joty; Giuseppe Carenini; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Topic segmentation and labeling is often considered a prerequisite for higher-levelconversation analysis and has been shown to be useful in many Natural LanguageProcessing (NLP) applications. We present two new corpora of email and blogconversations annotated with topics; and evaluate annotator reliability for the segmentationand labeling tasks in these asynchronous conversations. We propose a completecomputational framework for topic segmentation and labeling in asynchronousconversations. Our approach extends state-of-the-art methods by considering a fine-grainedstructure of an asynchronous conversation; along with other conversational features byapplying recent graph-based methods for NLP. For topic segmentation; we propose twonovel unsupervised models that exploit the fine-grained conversational structure; and a …,Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research,2013,32
Generating and validating abstracts of meeting conversations: a user study,Gabriel Murray; Giuseppe Carenini; Raymond Ng,Abstract In this paper we present a complete system for automatically generating naturallanguage abstracts of meeting conversations. This system is comprised of componentsrelating to interpretation of the meeting documents according to a meeting ontology;transformation or content selection from that source representation to a summaryrepresentation; and generation of new summary text. In a formative user study; we comparethis approach to gold-standard human abstracts and extracts to gauge the usefulness of thedifferent summary types for browsing meeting conversations. We find that our automaticallygenerated summaries are ranked significantly higher than human-selected extracts oncoherence and usability criteria. More generally; users demonstrate a strong preference forabstract-style summaries over extracts.,Proceedings of the 6th International Natural Language Generation Conference,2010,32
SIGMA 2: A system for the integrative genomic multi-dimensional analysis of cancer genomes; epigenomes; and transcriptomes,Raj Chari; Bradley P Coe; Craig Wedseltoft; Marie Benetti; Ian M Wilson; Emily A Vucic; Calum MacAulay; Raymond T Ng; Wan L Lam,High throughput microarray technologies have afforded the investigation of genomes;epigenomes; and transcriptomes at unprecedented resolution. However; software packagesto handle; analyze; and visualize data from these multiple'omics disciplines have not beenadequately developed. Here; we present SIGMA2; a system for the integrative genomic multi-dimensional analysis of cancer genomes; epigenomes; and transcriptomes. Multi-dimensional datasets can be simultaneously visualized and analyzed with respect to eachdimension; allowing combinatorial integration of the different assays belonging to thedifferent'omics. The identification of genes altered at multiple levels such as copy number;loss of heterozygosity (LOH); DNA methylation and the detection of consequential changesin gene expression can be concertedly performed; establishing SIGMA2 as a novel tool to …,BMC bioinformatics,2008,32
One-dimensional and multi-dimensional substring selectivity estimation,HV Jagadish; Olga Kapitskaia; Raymond T Ng; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract With the increasing importance of XML; LDAP directories; and text-basedinformation sources on the Internet; there is an ever-greater need to evaluate queriesinvolving (sub) string matching. In many cases; matches need to be on multipleattributes/dimensions; with correlations between the multiple dimensions. Effective queryoptimization in this context requires good selectivity estimates. In this paper; we use prunedcount-suffix trees (PSTs) as the basic data structure for substring selectivity estimation. Forthe 1-D problem; we present a novel technique called MO (Maximal Overlap). We thendevelop and analyze two 1-D estimation algorithms; MOC and MOLC; based on MO and aconstraint-based characterization of all possible completions of a given PST. For the kDproblem; we first generalize PSTs to multiple dimensions and develop a space-and time …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2000,32
Disruption of the non-canonical WNT pathway in lung squamous cell carcinoma,Eric HL Lee; Raj Chari; Andy Lam; Raymond T Ng; John Yee; John English; Kenneth G Evans; Calum MacAulay; Stephen Lam; Wan L Lam,Disruptions of beta-catenin and the canonical Wnt pathway are well documented in cancer.However; little is known of the non-canonical branch of the Wnt pathway. In this study; weinvestigate the transcript level patterns of genes in the Wnt pathway in squamous cell lungcancer using reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR. It was found that over half of the samplesexamined exhibited dysregulated gene expression of multiple components of the non-canonical branch of the WNT pathway. In the cases where beta catenin (CTNNB1) was notover-expressed; we identified strong relationships of expression between wingless-typeMMTV integration site family member 5A (WNT5A)/frizzled homolog 2 (FZD2); frizzledhomolog 3 (FZD3)/dishevelled 2 (DVL2); and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein5 (LRP5)/secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4).

Variation in RNA-Seq transcriptome profiles of peripheral whole blood from healthy individuals with and without globin depletion,Heesun Shin; Casey P Shannon; Nick Fishbane; Jian Ruan; Mi Zhou; Robert Balshaw; Janet E Wilson-McManus; Raymond T Ng; Bruce M McManus; Scott J Tebbutt,Background The molecular profile of circulating blood can reflect physiological andpathological events occurring in other tissues and organs of the body and delivers acomprehensive view of the status of the immune system. Blood has been useful in studyingthe pathobiology of many diseases. It is accessible and easily collected making it ideallysuited to the development of diagnostic biomarker tests. The blood transcriptome has a highcomplement of globin RNA that could potentially saturate next-generation sequencingplatforms; masking lower abundance transcripts. Methods to deplete globin mRNA areavailable; but their effect has not been comprehensively studied in peripheral whole bloodRNA-Seq data. In this study we aimed to assess technical variability associated with globindepletion in addition to assessing general technical variability in RNA-Seq from whole …,PLoS One,2014,30
Similarity join size estimation using locality sensitive hashing,Hongrae Lee; Raymond T Ng; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Similarity joins are important operations with a broad range of applications. In thispaper; we study the problem of vector similarity join size estimation (VSJ). It is ageneralization of the previously studied set similarity join size estimation (SSJ) problem andcan handle more interesting cases such as TF-IDF vectors. One of the key challenges insimilarity join size estimation is that the join size can change dramatically depending on theinput similarity threshold. We propose a sampling based algorithm that uses Locality-Sensitive-Hashing (LSH). The proposed algorithm LSH-SS uses an LSH index to enableeffective sampling even at high thresholds. We compare the proposed technique withrandom sampling and the state-of-the-art technique for SSJ (adapted to VSJ) anddemonstrate LSH-SS offers more accurate estimates throughout the similarity threshold …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,30
Pairwise network mechanisms in the host signaling response to coxsackievirus B3 infection,Farshid S Garmaroudi; David Marchant; Xiaoning Si; Abbas Khalili; Ali Bashashati; Brian W Wong; Aline Tabet; Raymond T Ng; Kevin Murphy; Honglin Luo; Kevin A Janes; Bruce M McManus,Abstract Signal transduction networks can be perturbed biochemically; genetically; andpharmacologically to unravel their functions. But at the systems level; it is not clear how suchperturbations are best implemented to extract molecular mechanisms that underlie networkfunction. Here; we combined pairwise perturbations with multiparameter phosphorylationmeasurements to reveal causal mechanisms within the signaling network response ofcardiomyocytes to coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection. Using all possible pairs of six kinaseinhibitors; we assembled a dynamic nine-protein phosphorylation signature of perturbedCVB3 infectivity. Cluster analysis of the resulting dataset showed repeatedly that pairedinhibitor data were required for accurate data-driven predictions of kinase substrate links inthe host network. With pairwise data; we also derived a high-confidence network based …,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2010,30
MD-SeeGH: a platform for integrative analysis of multi-dimensional genomic data,Bryan Chi; Bradley P Coe; Raymond T Ng; Calum MacAulay; Wan L Lam,Recent advances in global genomic profiling methodologies have enabled multi-dimensional characterization of biological systems. Complete analysis of these genomicprofiles require an in depth look at parallel profiles of segmental DNA copy number status;DNA methylation state; single nucleotide polymorphisms; as well as gene expressionprofiles. Due to the differences in data types it is difficult to conduct parallel analysis ofmultiple datasets from diverse platforms. To address this issue; we have developed anintegrative genomic analysis platform MD-SeeGH; a software tool that allows users to rapidlyand directly analyze genomic datasets spanning multiple genomic experiments. With MD-SeeGH; users have the flexibility to easily update datasets in accordance with new genomicbuilds; make a quality assessment of data using the filtering features; and identify genetic …,BMC bioinformatics,2008,30
MDQC: a new quality assessment method for microarrays based on quality control reports,Gabriela V Cohen Freue; Zsuzsanna Hollander; Enqing Shen; Ruben H Zamar; Robert Balshaw; Andreas Scherer; Bruce McManus; Paul Keown; W Robert McMaster; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Motivation: The process of producing microarray data involves multiple steps; someof which may suffer from technical problems and seriously damage the quality of the data.Thus; it is essential to identify those arrays with low quality. This article addresses twoquestions:(1) how to assess the quality of a microarray dataset using the measures providedin quality control (QC) reports;(2) how to identify possible sources of the quality problems.Results: We propose a novel multivariate approach to evaluate the quality of an array thatexamines the 'Mahalanobis distance'of its quality attributes from those of other arrays. Thus;we call it Mahalanobis Distance Quality Control (MDQC) and examine different approachesof this method. MDQC flags problematic arrays based on the idea of outlier detection; ie itflags those arrays whose quality attributes jointly depart from those of the bulk of the data …,Bioinformatics,2007,30
Preservation of patterns and input-output privacy,Shaofeng Bu; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond T Ng; Ganesh Ramesh,Privacy preserving data mining so far has mainly focused on the data collector scenariowhere individuals supply their personal data to an untrusted collector in exchange for value.In this scenario; random perturbation has proved to be very successful. An equallycompelling; but overlooked scenario; is that of a data custodian; which either owns the dataor is explicitly entrusted with ensuring privacy of individual data. In this scenario; we showthat it is possible to minimize disclosure while guaranteeing no outcome change. Weconduct our investigation in the context of building a decision tree and proposetransformations that preserve the exact decision tree. We show with a detailed set ofexperiments that they provide substantial protection to both input data privacy and miningoutput privacy.,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007.

Parallel computation of high-dimensional robust correlation and covariance matrices,James Chilson; Raymond Ng; Alan Wagner; Ruben Zamar,Abstract The computation of covariance and correlation matrices are critical to many datamining applications and processes. Unfortunately the classical covariance and correlationmatrices are very sensitive to outliers. Robust methods; such as Quadrant Correlation (QC)and the Maronna method; have been proposed. However; existing algorithms for QC onlygive acceptable performance when the dimensionality of the matrix is in the hundreds; andthe Maronna method is rarely used in practice because of its high computational cost. In thispaper we develop parallel algorithms for both QC and the Maronna method. We evaluatethese parallel algorithms using a real data set of the gene expression of over 6000 genes;giving rise to a matrix of over 18 million entries. In our experimental evaluation; we explorescalability in dimensionality and in the number of processors; and the trade-offs between …,Algorithmica,2006,30
Schemes for implementing buffer sharing in continuous-media systems,Dwight J Makaroff; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Buffer management in continuous-media systems is a frequently studied topic. Oneof the most interesting recent proposals is the idea of buffer sharing for concurrent streams.As analyzed in [6]; by taking advantage of the temporal behaviour of concurrent streams;buffer sharing can lead to a 50% savings in total buffer space. In this paper; we study how toactually implement buffer sharing. To this end; we develop the CES Buffer Sharing schemethat is very efficient to implement; and that permits savings asymptotically very close to theideal savings predicted by the analysis in [6]. We show that the CES scheme can operateeffectively under varying degrees of disk utilizations; and during transition periods when thenumber of concurrent streams changes. We also demonstrate how the scheme can befurther improved; particularly for situations when the number of concurrent streams is …,Information Systems,1995,30

Power-law based estimation of set similarity join size,Hongrae Lee; Raymond T Ng; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract We propose a novel technique for estimating the size of set similarity join. Theproposed technique relies on a succinct representation of sets using Min-Hash signatures.We exploit frequent patterns in the signatures for the Set Similarity Join (SSJoin) sizeestimation by counting their support. However; there are overlaps among the counts ofsignature patterns and we need to use the set Inclusion-Exclusion (IE) principle. We developa novel lattice-based counting method for efficiently evaluating the IE principle. Theproposed counting technique is linear in the lattice size. To make the mining process verylight-weight; we exploit a recently discovered Power-law relationship of pattern count andfrequency. Extensive experimental evaluations show the proposed technique is capable ofaccurate and efficient estimation.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,29
Finding boundary shape matching relationships in spatial data,Edwin M Knorr; Raymond T Ng; David L Shilvock,Abstract This paper considers a new kind of knowledge discovery among spatial objects—namely that of partial boundary shape matching. Our focus is on mining spatial data;whereby many objects called features (represented as polygons) are compared with one ormore point sets called clusters. The research described has practical application in suchdomains as Geographic Information Systems; in which a cluster of points (possibly createdby an SQL query) is compared to many natural or man-made features to detect partial ortotal matches of the facing boundaries of the cluster and feature. We begin by using analpha-shape to characterize the shape of an arbitrary cluster of points; thus producing a setof edges denoting the cluster's boundary. We then provide an approach for detecting aboundary shape match between the facing curves of the cluster and feature; and show …,International Symposium on Spatial Databases,1997,29
The segment support map: Scalable mining of frequent itemsets,Laks VS Lakshmanan; Carson Kai-Sang Leung; Raymond T Ng,ABSTRACT Since its introduction; frequent set mining has been generalized to many forms;including online mining with Carma; and constrained mining with CAP. Regardless;scalability is always an important aspect of the development. In this paper; we propose anovel structure called segment support map to help mining of frequent itemsets of thevarious forms. A light-weight structure; the segment support map improves the performanceof frequent-set mining algorithms by:(i) obtaining sharper bounds on the support of itemsets;and/or (ii) better exploiting properties of constraints. Our experimental results show theeffectiveness of the segment support map.,ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter,2000,28
Mdl summarization with holes,Shaofeng Bu; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Summarization of query results is an important problem for many OLAPapplications. The Minimum Description Length principle has been applied in various studiesto provide summaries. In this paper; we consider a new approach of applying the MDLprinciple. We study the problem of finding summaries of the form S Θ H for kd cubes with treehierarchies. The S part generalizes the query results; while the H part describes all theexceptions to the generalizations. The optimization problem is to minimize the combinedcardinalities of S and H. We first characterize the problem by showing that solving the 1-dproblem can be done in time linear to the size of hierarchy; but solving the 2-d problem is NP-hard. We then develop three different heuristics; based on a greedy approach; a dynamicprogramming approach and a quadratic programming approach. We conduct a …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,27
Model-based clustering of array CGH data,Sohrab P Shah; K-John Cheung Jr; Nathalie A Johnson; Guillaume Alain; Randy D Gascoyne; Douglas E Horsman; Raymond T Ng; Kevin P Murphy,Abstract Motivation: Analysis of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) data forrecurrent DNA copy number alterations from a cohort of patients can yield distinct sets ofmolecular signatures or profiles. This can be due to the presence of heterogeneous cancersubtypes within a supposedly homogeneous population. Results: We propose a novelstatistical method for automatically detecting such subtypes or clusters. Our approach ismodel based: each cluster is defined in terms of a sparse profile; which contains thelocations of unusually frequent alterations. The profile is represented as a hidden Markovmodel. Samples are assigned to clusters based on their similarity to the cluster's profile. Wesimultaneously infer the cluster assignments and the cluster profiles using an expectationmaximization-like algorithm. We show; using a realistic simulation study; that our method …,Bioinformatics,2009,26
Complex group-by queries for XML,Chaitanya Gokhale; Nitin Gupta; Pranav Kumar; Laks VS Lakshmanan; R Ng; B Aditya Prakash,The popularity of XML as a data exchange standard has led to the emergence of powerfulXML query languages like XQuery and studies on XML query optimization. Of late; there isconsiderable interest in analytical processing of XML data. As pointed out by Borkar andCarey; even for data integration; there is a compelling need for performing various group-bystyle aggregate operations. A core operator needed for analytics is the group-by operator;which is widely used in relational as well as OLAP database applications. XQuery requiresgroup-by operations to be simulated using nesting.,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007. IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,26
Evolution and revolutions in LDAP directory caches,Olga Kapitskaia; Raymond T Ng; Divesh Srivastava,Abstract LDAP directories have recently proliferated with the growth of the Internet; and arebeing used in a wide variety of network-based applications. In this paper; we propose theuse of generalized queries; referred to as query templates; obtained by generalizingindividual user queries; as the semantic basis for low overhead; high benefit LDAP directorycaches for handling declarative queries. We present efficient incremental algorithms that;given a sequence of user queries; maintain a set of potentially beneficial candidate querytemplates; and select a sub-set of these candidates for admission into the directory cache. Anovel feature of our algorithms is their ability to deal with overlapping query templates.Finally; we demonstrate the advantages of template caches over query caches; with anexperimental study based on real data and a prototype implementation of the LDAP …,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2000,26

OSSM: A segmentation approach to optimize frequency counting,CK-S Leung; Raymond T Ng; Heikki Mannila,Computing the frequency of a pattern is one of the key operations in data mining algorithms.We describe a simple yet powerful way of speeding up any form of frequency countingsatisfying the monotonicity condition. Our method; the optimized segment support map(OSSM); is a light-weight structure which partitions the collection of transactions into msegments; so as to reduce the number of candidate patterns that require frequency counting.We study the following problems:(1) what is the optimal number of segments to be used; and(2) given a user-determined m; what is the best segmentation/composition of the msegments? For Problem 1; we provide a thorough analysis and a theorem establishing theminimum value of m for which there is no accuracy lost in using the OSSM. For Problem 2;we develop various algorithms and heuristics; which efficiently generate OSSMs that are …,Data Engineering; 2002. Proceedings. 18th International Conference on,2002,24

Discovering roll-up dependencies,Jef Wijsen; Raymond T Ng; Toon Calders,Abstract We introduce the problem of discovering functional determinacies that result from“rolling up” data to a higher abstraction level. Such a determinacy is called a Roll-Up De-pendency (RUD). An example RUD is: The probability that two files in the same directoryhave the same file extension; is greater than a specific number. We show the applicability ofRUDs for OLAP and data mining. We consider the problem of mining RUDs that satisfyspecified support and confidence thresholds. This problem is NP-hard in the number ofattributes. We give an algorithm for this problem. Experimental results show that thealgorithm uses linear time in the number of tuples of the input database.,Proceedings of the fifth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,1999,24
Stable model semantics for probabilistic deductive databases,Raymond Ng; VS Subrahmanian,Abstract In this paper we study the uses and the semantics of non-monotonic negation inprobabilistic deductive databases. Based on the stable model semantics for classical logicprogramming; we examine two notions of stability. The first one is stable probabilistic modelswhich are straightforward extensions of the classical stable models. But we prove that thisnotion may be too weak in our probabilistic framework. Then we introduce the secondnotion: stable families of probabilistic models. We show that this notion is much strongerthan the first one; and we demonstrate how this stable family semantics can handle defaultreasoning appropriately in the context of probabilistic deduction.,International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems,1991,24

Exploiting conversation structure in unsupervised topic segmentation for emails,Shafiq Joty; Giuseppe Carenini; Gabriel Murray; Raymond T Ng,Abstract This work concerns automatic topic segmentation of email conversations. Wepresent a corpus of email threads manually annotated with topics; and evaluate annotatorreliability. To our knowledge; this is the first such email corpus. We show how the existingtopic segmentation models (ie; Lexical Chain Segmenter (LCSeg) and Latent DirichletAllocation (LDA)) which are solely based on lexical information; can be applied to emails. Bypointing out where these methods fail and what any desired model should consider; wepropose two novel extensions of the models that not only use lexical information but alsoexploit finer level conversation structure in a principled way. Empirical evaluation shows thatLCSeg is a better model than LDA for segmenting an email thread into topical clusters andincorporating conversation structure into these models improves the performance …,Proceedings of the 2010 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2010,22
Implementing deductive databases by mixed integer programming,Colin Bell; Anil Nerode; Raymond T Ng; VS Subrahmanian,Abstract Existing and past generations of Prolog compilers have left deduction to run-timeand this may account for the poor run-time performance of existing Prolog systems. Our worktries to minimize run-time deduction by shifting the deductive process to compile-time. Inaddition; we offer an alternative inferencing procedure based on translating logic to mixedinteger programming. This makes available for research and implementation in deductivedatabases; all the theorems; algorithms; and software packages developed by theoperations research community over the past 50 years. The method keeps the same querylanguage as for disjunctive deductive databases; only the inferencing procedure changes.The language is purely declarative; independent of the order of rules in the program; andindependent of the order in which literals occur in clause bodies. The technique avoids …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1996,22
The projected epidemic of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hospitalizations over the next 15 years. A population-based perspective,Amir Khakban; Don D Sin; J Mark FitzGerald; Bruce M McManus; Raymond Ng; Zsuzsanna Hollander; Mohsen Sadatsafavi,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major source of morbidity; mortality; andcosts in the Western world (1). In the United States; for example; COPD is responsible for$72 billion/yr in direct healthcare expenditures (2). The biggest driver of these healthcarecosts is hospitalization. Unlike many other major causes of hospitalization; hospitalizationsrelated to COPD continue to increase despite falling rates in cigarette smoking. It isprojected that within 5 years; COPD hospitalizations will exceed those of ischemic heartdisease; which is the current number one cause of medical hospitalization in the UnitedStates (Figure 1)(3). In countries such as Canada; which have older demographics than theUnited States; COPD has already surpassed ischemic heart disease as the leading cause ofhospitalization (4).

Visual mining of power sets with large alphabets,Tamara Munzner; Qiang Kong; Raymond T Ng; Jordan Lee; Janek Klawe; Dragana Radulovic; Carson K Leung,ABSTRACT We present the PowerSetViewer visualization system for the lattice-basedmining of power sets. Searching for itemsets within the power set of a universe occurs inmany large dataset knowledge discovery contexts. Using a spatial layout based on a powerset provides a unified visual framework at three different levels: data mining on the filtereddataset; browsing the entire dataset; and comparing multiple datasets sharing the samealphabet. The features of our system allow users to find appropriate parameter settings fordata mining algorithms through lightweight visual experimentation showing partial results.We use dynamic constrained frequent set mining as a concrete case study to showcase theutility of the system.

Dealing with semantic heterogeneity by generalization-based data mining techniques,Jiawei Han; Raymond T Ng; Yongjian Fu; S Dao,Abstract Data mining; or knowledge discovery from databases; may play an important role atthe construction of cooperative information systems. A major challenge for buildingcooperative information systems is the semantic heterogeneity problem. Methods forschema analysis; transformation; and integration have been investigated for providing agood tool to handle this problem. However; schema level analysis may sometimes be toogeneral to solve the problem. Data level analysis; ie; the analysis of database contents;should be taken into serious consideration. Data mining provides a powerful tool to viewdatabase contents at a high abstraction level and transform low-level heterogeneous datainto high-level homogeneous information.

Biomarker development for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. From discovery to clinical implementation,Don D Sin; Zsuzsanna Hollander; Mari L DeMarco; Bruce M McManus; Raymond T Ng,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the major causes of morbidity andmortality in the world. Regrettably; there are no biomarkers to objectively diagnose COPDexacerbations; which are the major drivers of hospitalization and deaths from COPD.Moreover; there are no biomarkers to guide therapeutic choices or to risk stratify patients forimminent exacerbations and no objective biomarkers of disease activity or diseaseprogression. Although there has been a tremendous investment in COPD biomarkerdiscovery over the past 2 decades; clinical translation and implementation have not matchedthese efforts. In this article; we outline the challenges of biomarker development in COPDand provide an overview of a developmental pipeline that may be able to surmount thesechallenges and bring novel biomarker solutions to accelerate therapeutic discoveries and …,American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,2015,20
Local outlier detection with interpretation,Xuan Hong Dang; Barbora Micenková; Ira Assent; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Outlier detection aims at searching for a small set of objects that are inconsistent orconsiderably deviating from other objects in a dataset. Existing research focuses on outlieridentification while omitting the equally important problem of outlier interpretation. Thispaper presents a novel method named LODI to address both problems at the same time. InLODI; we develop an approach that explores the quadratic entropy to adaptively select a setof neighboring instances; and a learning method to seek an optimal subspace in which anoutlier is maximally separated from its neighbors. We show that this learning task can besolved via the matrix eigen-decomposition and its solution contains essential information toreveal features that are most important to interpret the exceptional properties of outliers. Wedemonstrate the appealing performance of LODI via a number of synthetic and real world …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2013,20

Detecting disagreement in conversations using pseudo-monologic rhetorical structure,Kelsey Allen; Giuseppe Carenini; Raymond Ng,Abstract Casual online forums such as Reddit; Slashdot and Digg; are continuing toincrease in popularity as a means of communication. Detecting disagreement in this domainis a considerable challenge. Many topics are unique to the conversation on the forum; andthe appearance of disagreement may be much more subtle than on political blogs or socialmedia sites such as twitter. In this analysis we present a crowd-sourced annotated corpus fortopic level disagreement detection in Slashdot; showing that disagreement detection in thisdomain is difficult even for humans. We then proceed to show that a new set of featuresdetermined from the rhetorical structure of the conversation significantly improves theperformance on disagreement detection over a baseline consisting of unigram/bigramfeatures; discourse markers; structural features and meta-post features.,Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP),2014,19

Semantics; consistency; and query processing of empirical deductive databases,Raymond T.  Ng,In recent years; there has been a growing interest in reasoning with uncertainty in logicprogramming and deductive databases. However; most frameworks proposed thus far; areeither nonprobabilistic in nature or based on subjective probabilities. We address theproblem of incorporating empirical probabilities-that is; probabilities obtained from statisticalfindings-in deductive databases. To this end; we develop a formal model theoretic basis forsuch databases. We also present a sound and complete algorithm for checking theconsistency of such databases. Moreover; we develop consistency preserving ways tooptimize the algorithm for practical usage. Finally; we show how query answering forempirical deductive databases can be carried out.,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,1997,19

Acute rejection is still a significant barrier to long-term survival of the allograft.Current acute rejection diagnostic methods are not specific enough or are invasive. Therehave been a number of studies that have explored the blood or the biopsy to discovergenomic biomarkers of acute rejection; however; none of the studies to date have used both.Methods. We analyzed endomyocardial biopsy tissue and whole blood-derived messengerRNA from 11 acute rejection and 20 nonrejection patients using Affymetrix Human GenomeU133 Plus 2.0 chips.

Although progress has beenmade in understanding the normal functions of progranulin and TDP-43; the molecularinteractions between these proteins remain unclear. Progranulin is proteolytically processedinto granulins; but the role of granulins in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease isunknown. We used a Caenorhabditis elegans model of neuronal TDP-43 proteinopathy tospecifically interrogate the contribution of granulins to the neurodegenerative process.Complete loss of the progranulin gene did not worsen TDP-43 toxicity; whereas progranulinheterozygosity did.

Geo-spatial Clustering with User-Specified Constraints,Anthony KH Tung; Raymond T Ng; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Jiawei Han,Abstract Capturing application semantics and allowing a human analyst to express his focusin mining have been the motivation for several recent studies on constrained mining. In thispaper; we introduce and study the problem of constrained clustering—finding clusters thatsatisfy certain user-specified constraints. We argue that this problem arises naturally inpractice. Two types of constraints are discussed in this paper. The first type of constraints areimposed by physical obstacles that exist in the region of clustering. The second type ofconstraints are SQL constraints which every cluster must satisfy. We provide a prelimaryintroduction to both types of constraints and discuss some techniques for solving them.,Proceedings of the First International Conference on Multimedia Data Mining,2000,17
A template-based abstractive meeting summarization: Leveraging summary and source text relationships,Tatsuro Oya; Yashar Mehdad; Giuseppe Carenini; Raymond Ng,Abstract In this paper; we present an automatic abstractive summarization system of meetingconversations. Our system extends a novel multi-sentence fusion algorithm in order togenerate abstract templates. It also leverages the relationship between summaries and theirsource meeting transcripts to select the best templates for generating abstractive summariesof meetings. Our manual and automatic evaluation results demonstrate the success of oursystem in achieving higher scores both in readability and informativeness.,Proceedings of the 8th International Natural Language Generation Conference (INLG),2014,16
Abstractive meeting summarization with entailment and fusion,Yashar Mehdad; Giuseppe Carenini; Frank Tompa,Abstract We propose a novel end-to-end framework for abstractive meeting summarization.We cluster sentences in the input into communities and build an entailment graph over thesentence communities to identify and select the most relevant sentences. We thenaggregate those selected sentences by means of a word graph model. We exploit a rankingstrategy to select the best path in the word graph as an abstract sentence. Despite notrelying on the syntactic structure; our approach significantly outperforms previous models formeeting summarization in terms of informativeness. Moreover; the longer sentencesgenerated by our method are competitive with shorter sentences generated by the previousword graph model in terms of grammaticality.,Proceedings of the 14th European Workshop on Natural Language Generation,2013,16
A model-based ensembling approach for developing QSARs,Qianyi Zhang; Jacqueline M Hughes-Oliver; Raymond T Ng,Ensemble methods have become popular for QSAR modeling; but most studies haveassumed balanced data; consisting of approximately equal numbers of active and inactivecompounds. Cheminformatics data are often far from being balanced. We extend theapplication of ensemble methods to include cases of imbalance of class membership and tomore adequately assess model output. Based on the extension; we propose an ensemblemethod called MBEnsemble that automatically determines the appropriate tuningparameters to provide reliable predictions and maximize the F-measure. Results frommultiple data sets demonstrate that the proposed ensemble technique works well onimbalanced data.,Journal of chemical information and modeling,2009,16
Approximate substring selectivity estimation,Hongrae Lee; Raymond T Ng; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract We study the problem of estimating selectivity of approximate substring queries. Itsimportance in databases is ever increasing as more and more data are input by users andare integrated with many typographical errors and different spelling conventions. To beginwith; we consider edit distance for the similarity between a pair of strings. Based oninformation stored in an extended N-gram table; we propose two estimation algorithms; MOFand LBS for the task. The latter extends the former with ideas from set hashing signatures.The experimental results show that MOF is a light-weight algorithm that gives fairly accurateestimations. However; if more space is available; LBS can give better accuracy than MOFand other baseline methods. Next; we extend the proposed solution to other similaritypredicates; SQL LIKE operator and Jaccard similarity.,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,16

A hidden email is an original email that has been quoted inat least one email in a folder; but does not present itself in the same folder. It may have been(un) intentionally deleted or may never have been received.

Efficient compilation of large rule bases using logical access paths,Timos K Sellis; Nick Roussopoulos; Raymond T Ng,Abstract This paper presents an efficient way to compile and store large deductivedatabases. Deductive rules are modeled through logical access paths and then integratedinto a global structure; the Rule-base Access Path Schema (RAP Schema). The RAPSchema stores information on the interrelationships that exist among the computationsrequired for rule executions. Ground data as well as data derived through some ruleexecutions and cached for later reuse are also modeled in the RAP Schema. Some of theadvantages of using this rule base organization scheme include the automatic detection ofshared computations; the inclusion of cached results of rule executions and query results inthe knowledge base. The details of the compilation and query processing phases are thefocus of the paper.,Information Systems,1990,16

Using the omega index for evaluating abstractive community detection,Gabriel Murray; Giuseppe Carenini; Raymond Ng,Abstract Numerous NLP tasks rely on clustering or community detection algorithms. Formany of these tasks; the solutions are disjoint; and the relevant evaluation metrics assumenonoverlapping clusters. In contrast; the relatively recent task of abstractive communitydetection (ACD) results in overlapping clusters of sentences. ACD is a sub-task of anabstractive summarization system and represents a twostep process. In the first step; weclassify sentence pairs according to whether the sentences should be realized by a commonabstractive sentence. This results in an undirected graph with sentences as nodes andpredicted abstractive links as edges. The second step is to identify communities within thegraph; where each community corresponds to an abstractive sentence to be generated.

Multiresolution subimage similarity matching for large image databases,Kai-Sang Leung; Raymond T Ng,Many database management systems support whole-image matching. However; users mayonly remember certain subregions of the images. In this paper; we develop Padding andReduction Algorithms to support subimage queries of arbitrary size based on local colorinformation. The idea is to estimate the best-case lower bound to the dissimilarity measurebetween the query and the image. By making use of multiresolution representation; thislower bound becomes tighter as the scale becomes finer. Because image contents areusually pre-extracted and stored; a key issue is how to determine the number of levels usedin the representation. We address this issue analytically by estimating the CPU and I/Ocosts; and experimentally by comparing the performance and accuracy of the outcomes ofvarious filtering schemes. Our findings suggest that a 3-level hierarchy is preferred. We …,Storage and Retrieval for Image and Video Databases VI,1997,13

We cluster the selected sentences based on their lexical similarityand aggregate the sentences in each cluster by means of a word graph model. We proposea ranking strategy to select the best path in the constructed graph as a query-based abstractsentence for each cluster. A resulting summary consists of abstractive sentencesrepresenting the phrasal query information and the overall content of the conversation.Automatic and manual evaluation results over meeting; chat and email conversations showthat our approach significantly outperforms baselines and previous extractive models.,Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers),2014,12

We then aggregate those selectedphrases by means of phrase generalization and merging. We motivate our approach byapplying over conversational data; and show that our framework improves performancesignificantly over baseline algorithms.,Proceedings of the 2013 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies,2013,12
Domain adaptation to summarize human conversations,Oana Sandu; Giuseppe Carenini; Gabriel Murray; Raymond Ng,Abstract We are interested in improving the summarization of conversations by usingdomain adaptation. Since very few email corpora have been annotated for summarizationpurposes; we attempt to leverage the labeled data available in the multiparty meetingsdomain for the summarization of email threads. In this paper; we compare severalapproaches to supervised domain adaptation using out-of-domain labeled data; and also tryto use unlabeled data in the target domain through semi-supervised domain adaptation.From the results of our experiments; we conclude that with some in-domain labeled data;training in-domain with no adaptation is most effective; but that when there is no labeled in-domain data; domain adaptation algorithms such as structural correspondence learning canimprove summarization.,Proceedings of the 2010 Workshop on Domain Adaptation for Natural Language Processing,2010,12
Regression-Based Summarization of Email Conversations.,Jan Ulrich; Giuseppe Carenini; Gabriel Murray; Raymond T Ng,Abstract In this paper we present a regression-based machine learning approach to emailthread summarization. The regression model is able to take advantage of multiple gold-standard annotations for training purposes; in contrast to most work with binary classifiers.We also investigate the usefulness of novel features such as speech acts. This paper alsointroduces a newly created and publicly available email corpus for summarization research.We show that regression-based classifiers perform better than binary classifiers becausethey preserve more information about annotator judgements. In our comparison betweendifferent regression-based classifiers; we found that Bagging and Gaussian Processes havethe highest weighted recall.,Icwsm,2009,12
Discovery and regeneration of hidden emails,Giuseppe Carenini; Raymond Ng; Xiaodong Zhou; Ed Zwart,Abstract The popularity of email has triggered researchers to look for ways to help usersbetter organize the enormous amount of information stored in their email folders. Onechallenge that has not been studied extensively in text mining is the reconstruction of hiddenemails. A hidden email is an original email that has been quoted in subsequent emails but isnot itself present in the folder; it may have been deleted or may never have been received.This paper proposes a method for reconstructing hidden emails using the embeddedquotations found in messages further down the thread hierarchy. To do so; we model all thequoted fragments in a precedence graph; from which hidden emails are regenerated asbulletized documents. The bulletized model is our solution to the situation when a totalordering of fragment is not possible. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for each …,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2005,12
Multilevel filtering for high-dimensional image data: Why and how,Raymond T Ng; Dominic Tam,It has been shown that filtering is a promising way to support efficient content-based retrievalfrom image data. However; all existing studies on filtering restrict their attention to two levels.We consider filtering structures that have at least three levels. In the first half of the paper; byanalyzing the CPU and I/O costs of various structures; we provide analytic evidence on whythree-level structures can often outperform corresponding two-level ones. We provide furtherexperimental results showing that the three-level structures are typically the best; and canbeat the two-level ones by a wide margin. In the second half of the paper; we study how tofind the (near-) optimal three-level structure for a given dataset. We develop an optimizerthat can handle this task effectively and efficiently. Experimental results indicate that in tensof seconds of CPU time; the optimizer can find a filtering structure whose total runtime per …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1999,12
An expressive language and interface for image querying,Dwifiandika S Faulus; Raymond T Ng,Abstract. One key component in providing effective image data management support is anexpressive query language/interface. In this paper; we describe the EXQUISI system that wehave developed. A main contribution of EXQUISI is its ability to allow a user to expresssubtle differences that may exist between images to be retrieved and other images that aresimilar. In particular; it allows the user to incorporate ambiguities and imprecisions inspecifying his/her query. Another important aspect of EXQUISI is the provision of areformulation language by which the user can ask “like this in what” queries; by specifyingwhich parts of a returned image the user wants to include and exclude.,Machine Vision and Applications,1997,12
Mining probabilistic representative frequent patterns from uncertain data,Chunyang Liu; Ling Chen; Chengqi Zhang,Abstract Probabilistic frequent pattern mining over uncertain data has received a great dealof attention recently due to the wide applications of uncertain data. Similar to its counterpartin deterministic databases; however; probabilistic frequent pattern mining suffers from thesame problem of generating an exponential number of result patterns. The large number ofdiscovered patterns hinders further evaluation and analysis; and calls for the need to find asmall number of representative patterns to approximate all other patterns. This paperformally defines the problem of probabilistic representative frequent pattern (P-RFP) mining;which aims to find the minimal set of patterns with sufficiently high probability to represent allother patterns. The problem's bottleneck turns out to be checking whether a pattern canprobabilistically represent another; which involves the computation of a joint probability of …,*,2013,11
Outlier detection with space transformation and spectral analysis,Xuan Hong Dang; Barbora Micenková; Ira Assent; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Detecting a small number of outliers from a set of data observations is alwayschallenging. In this paper; we present an approach that exploits space transformation anduses spectral analysis in the newly transformed space for outlier detection. Unlike mostexisting techniques in the literature which rely on notions of distances or densities; thisapproach introduces a novel concept based on local quadratic entropy for evaluating thesimilarity of a data object with its neighbors. This information theoretic quantity is used toregularize the closeness amongst data instances and subsequently benefits the process ofmapping data into a usually lower dimensional space. Outliers are then identified by spectralanalysis of the eigenspace spanned by the set of leading eigenvectors derived from themapping procedure. The proposed technique is purely data-driven and imposes no …,*,2013,11
Introduction to the special issue on data mining for health informatics,Raymond T Ng; Jian Pei,Abstract One of the holy grails of medical research in the next decade is what is often called"personalized" medicine. The goal is to individualize therapy and treatment options; andeven prevention strategies. This movement is fueled by the rapid advances made in high-throughput biotechnologies.

Using version information for concern inference and code-assist,Annie TT Ying; Gail C Murphy; Raymond T Ng; Mark C Chu-Carroll,ABSTRACT We propose an approach to assist software developers perform modificationtasks that may involve source code artifacts that crosscut the system's code base. Ourhypothesis is that given some initial knowledge about which source code artifacts (eg;methods or classes in an object-oriented language) may need to change in a modificationtask at hand; past modification tasks help predict the additional source code artifacts thatneed to change to complete the desired modification. Our approach is to analyze the pastmodification tasks using association rule mining. Essentially; association rule mining findsrelationships between source code artifacts that tend to change together. We envision a toolthat uses this approach to interactively guide software engineers during the implementationof modification tasks. The tool might also help identify concerns since code related to a …,Tool Support for Aspect-Oriented Software Development Workshop,2002,11
Analysis of multilevel color histograms,Raymond T Ng; Dominic Tam,Color is one of the most recognizable elements of image content; and color histogram is themost commonly used technique for indexing colors. Faloutsos et al. propose using a 3Dindex to perform histogram filtering. Sawhney and Hafner later generalize the filteringapproach by using k-dimensional indices. The main contribution of this paper is thedevelopment and analysis of multi-level color histograms. The key idea is to insert additionallevels of abstracted histograms in between a low dimensional index and the originalhistograms. Based on a cost model we developed; our analysis shows that in most cases;the optimal 3-level and 4-level configurations; when compared with the Faloutsosconfiguration and the optimal Sawhney-Hafner configuration; require lower CPU and I/Ocosts. Experimental results indicate that the gain in total time can vary from 22% to 400 …,Storage and Retrieval for Image and Video Databases V,1997,11

The purpose of this study was to discover novel blood proteomic biomarkersignatures of recovered heart function that could lead to more effective heart failure patientmanagement by both primary care and specialty physicians. Methods and results Thediscovery cohort included 41 heart transplant patients and 20 healthy individuals. Plasmalevels of 138 proteins were detected in at least 75% of these subjects by iTRAQ massspectrometry. Eighteen proteins were identified that had (i) differential levels between pre-transplant patients with end-stage heart failure and healthy individuals; and (ii) levels thatreturned to normal by 1 month post-transplant in patients with stable heart function aftertransplantation. Seventeen of the 18 markers were validated by multiple reaction …,European journal of heart failure,2014,10
Two-stage; in silico deconvolution of the lymphocyte compartment of the peripheral whole blood transcriptome in the context of acute kidney allograft rejection,Casey P Shannon; Robert Balshaw; Raymond T Ng; Janet E Wilson-McManus; Paul Keown; Robert McMaster; Bruce M McManus; David Landsberg; Nicole M Isbel; Greg Knoll; Scott J Tebbutt,Acute rejection is a major complication of solid organ transplantation that prevents the long-term assimilation of the allograft. Various populations of lymphocytes are principal mediatorsof this process; infiltrating graft tissues and driving cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Understandingthe lymphocyte-specific biology associated with rejection is therefore critical. Measuringgenome-wide changes in transcript abundance in peripheral whole blood cells can deliver acomprehensive view of the status of the immune system. The heterogeneous nature of thetissue significantly affects the sensitivity and interpretability of traditional analyses; however.Experimental separation of cell types is an obvious solution; but is often impractical and;more worrying; may affect expression; leading to spurious results.

Temporal dependencies generalized for spatial and other dimensions,Jef Wijsen; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Recently; there has been a lot of interest in temporal granularity; and itsapplications in temporal dependency theory and data mining. Generalization hierarchiesused in multi-dimensional databases and OLAP serve a role similar to that of timegranularity in temporal databases; but they also apply to non-temporal dimensions; likespace. In this paper; we first generalize temporal functional dependencies for non-temporaldimensions; which leads to the notion of roll-up dependency (RUD). We show theapplicability of RUDs in conceptual modeling and data mining. We then indicate that thenotion of time granularity used in temporal databases is generally more expressive than thegeneralization hierarchies in multi-dimensional databases; and show how this surplusexpressiveness can be introduced in non-temporal dimensions; which leads to the …,*,1999,10

A computational pipeline for the development of multi-marker bio-signature panels and ensemble classifiers,Oliver P Günther; Virginia Chen; Gabriela Cohen Freue; Robert F Balshaw; Scott J Tebbutt; Zsuzsanna Hollander; Mandeep Takhar; W Robert McMaster; Bruce M McManus; Paul A Keown; Raymond T Ng,Biomarker panels derived separately from genomic and proteomic data and with a variety ofcomputational methods have demonstrated promising classification performance in variousdiseases. An open question is how to create effective proteo-genomic panels. Theframework of ensemble classifiers has been applied successfully in various analyticaldomains to combine classifiers so that the performance of the ensemble exceeds theperformance of individual classifiers. Using blood-based diagnosis of acute renal allograftrejection as a case study; we address the following question in this paper: Can acuterejection classification performance be improved by combining individual genomic andproteomic classifiers in an ensemble?

Supervised Topic Segmentation of Email Conversations.,Shafiq R Joty; Giuseppe Carenini; Gabriel Murray; Raymond T Ng,Abstract We propose a graph-theoretic supervised topic segmentation model for emailconversations which combines (i) lexical knowledge;(ii) conversational features; and (iii)topic features. We compare our results with the existing unsupervised models (ie; LCSegand LDA); and with their two extensions for email conversations (ie; LCSeg+ FQG and LDA+FQG) that not only use lexical information but also exploit finer conversation structure.Empirical evaluation shows that our supervised model is the best performer and achieveshighest accuracy by combining the three different knowledge sources; where knowledgeabout the conversation has proved to be the most important indicator for segmenting emails.,ICWSM,2011,9
Optimization-based content selection for opinion summarization,Jackie Chi Kit Cheung; Giuseppe Carenini; Raymond T Ng,Abstract We introduce a content selection method for opinion summarization based on awell-studied; formal mathematical model; the p-median clustering problem from facilitylocation theory. Our method replaces a series of local; myopic steps to content selection witha global solution; and is designed to allow content and realization decisions to be naturallyintegrated. We evaluate and compare our method against an existing heuristic-basedmethod on content selection; using human selections as a gold standard. We find that thealgorithms perform similarly; suggesting that our content selection method is robust enoughto support integration with other aspects of summarization.,Proceedings of the 2009 Workshop on Language Generation and Summarisation,2009,9

Reasoning with uncertainty in deductive databases and logic programs,Raymond T Ng,Of all scientific investigations into reasoning with uncertainty and chance; probability theoryis perhaps the best understood paradigm. Nevertheless; all studies conducted thus far onthe semantics of quantitative logic programming have been restricted to non-probabilisticsemantical characterizations. In this paper; we survey the major features and summarize themajor results of the various frameworks that we have developed to rectify this situation. In thefirst part of this paper; we outline a deductive database framework which is expressiveenough to represent such probabilistic relationships as conditional probabilities; Bayesianupdates; probability propagation and mutual exclusion. We propose a fixpoint theory and aprobabilistic model theory; and characterize their inter-relationships. As the aforementionedlanguage is monotonic in nature; we discuss in the second half of this paper three …,International Journal of Uncertainty; Fuzziness and Knowledge-based Systems,1997,9

White blood cell differentials enrich whole blood expression data in the context of acute cardiac allograft rejection,Casey P Shannon; Zsuzsanna Hollander; Janet Wilson-McManus; Robert Balshaw; Raymond T Ng; Robert McMaster; Bruce M McManus; Paul A Keown; Scott J Tebbutt,Acute cardiac allograft rejection is a serious complication of heart transplantation.Investigating molecular processes in whole blood via microarrays is a promising avenue ofresearch in transplantation; particularly due to the non-invasive nature of blood sampling.However; whole blood is a complex tissue and the consequent heterogeneity in compositionamongst samples is ignored in traditional microarray analysis. This complicates thebiological interpretation of microarray data. Here we have applied a statistical deconvolutionapproach; cell-specific significance analysis of microarrays (csSAM); to whole bloodsamples from subjects either undergoing acute heart allograft rejection (AR) or not (NR). Weidentified eight differentially expressed probe-sets significantly correlated to monocytes(mapping to 6 genes; all down-regulated in ARs versus NRs) at a false discovery rate …,Bioinformatics and biology insights,2012,8

Assessment of SVM reliability for microarray data analysis,Andrea Malossini; Enrico Blanzieri; Raymond Ng,The goal of our research is to provide techniques that can assess and validate the results ofSVM-based analysis of microarray data. We present preliminary results of the effect ofmislabeled training samples. We conducted several systematic experiments on artificial andreal medical data using SVMs. We systematically flipped the labels of a fraction of thetraining data. We show that a relatively small number of mislabeled examples candramatically decrease the performance as visualized on the ROC graphs. This phenomenonpersists even if the dimensionality of the input space is drastically decreased; by using forexample feature selection. Moreover we show that for SVM recursive feature elimination;even a small fraction of mislabeled samples can completely change the resulting set ofgenes.

Schemes for Implementing Buffer Sharing in Continuous Media Systems,D Makaroff; Raymond T Ng,Abstract| Bu er management in continuous-media systems is a frequently studied topic. Oneof the most interesting recent proposals is the idea of bu er sharing for concurrent streams.As analyzed in 6]; by taking advantage of the temporal behaviour of concurrent streams; buer sharing can lead to a 50% savings in total bu er space. In this paper; we study how toactually implement bu er sharing. To this end; we develop the CES Bu er Sharing schemethat is very e cient to implement; and that permits savings asymptotically very close to theideal savings predicted by the analysis in 6]. We show that the CES scheme can operate eectively under varying degrees of disk utilizations; and during transition periods when thenumber of concurrent streams changes. We also demonstrate how the scheme can befurther improved; particularly for situations when the number of concurrent streams is …,Information Systems,1994,8
Non-monotonic negation in probabilistic deductive databases,Raymond T Ng; VS Subrahmanian,Abstract In this paper we study the uses and the semantics of non-monotonic negation inprobabilistic deductive databases. Based on the stable semantics for classical logicprogramming; we introduce the notion of stable formula functions. We show that stableformula functions are minimal fixpoints of operators associated with probabilistic deductivedatabases with negation. Furthermore; since a probabilistic deductive database may notnecessarily have a stable formula function; we provide a stable class semantics for suchdatabases. Finally; we demonstrate that the proposed semantics can handle defaultreasoning naturally in the context of probabilistic deduction.,*,1991,8
Biomarker development in COPD: moving from P values to products to impact patient care,Zsuzsanna Hollander; Mari L DeMarco; Mohsen Sadatsafavi; Bruce M McManus; Raymond T Ng; Don D Sin,There is a great interest in developing biomarkers to enable precision medicine and improvehealth outcomes of patients with COPD. However; biomarker development is extremelychallenging and expensive; and translation of research endeavors to date has been largelyunsuccessful. In most cases; biomarkers fail because of poor replication of initial promisingresults in independent cohorts and/or inability to transfer the biomarker from a discoveryplatform to a clinical assay. Ultimately; new biomarker assays must address 5 questions foroptimal clinical translation. They include the following: is the biomarker likely to be (1)superior (will the test outperform current standards?);(2) actionable (will the test changepatient management?);(3) valuable (will the test improve patient outcomes?);(4) economical(will the implementation of the biomarker in the target population be cost-saving or cost …,Chest,2017,7

Identifying unusual spatio-temporal trajectories from surveillance videos,Vladimir Tucakov; R Ng,Video surveillance is a powerful method of ensuring safety of public places. While there aremillions of cameras video taping public places; automated systems that can intelligentlymonitor a scene are few and far between. This paper reports on a feasibility study for anautomated system that is able to identify suspicious behavior of people in public places. Thespecific purpose of the study is to develop and evaluate a method for outlier detection in thedomain of 2-D motion tracking. The task at hand is motion tracking of people walkingthrough an open space such an atrium or a large hallway of a building. People generallytake similar paths as they are walking from point A to point B in the building. It is up to thesystem to identify paths that are unusual; and to bring the paths to the attention of the humanuser.,Proc. of 1998 SIGMOD Workshop on Research Issues on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery (DMKD’98),1998,7
Multiscale similarity matching for subimage queries of arbitrary size,Kai-Sang Leung; Raymond Ng,Abstract Many image database management systems support whole-image queries.However; in some situations; users may only remember certain portions of the images. Inthis paper; we develop Padding and Reduction Algorithms to support subimage queries ofarbitrary size based on local color information. The idea is to estimate the best-case lowerbound to the distance between the query and the image. To improve the efficiency andeffectiveness of content-based retrieval; a multiscale representation is proposed. Sinceimage contents are usually pre-extracted and stored; the number of levels used in such arepresentation needs to be determined. We address this issue analytically by estimating theCPU and I/O costs; and experimentally by comparing the performance and accuracy of theoutcomes of various filtering schemes. Our findings suggest that a 3-level hierarchy is …,*,1998,7

We sought to develop and validate anindividualized prediction model for forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV 1) in currentsmokers with mild-to-moderate COPD. Methods: Using data from a large long-term clinicaltrial (the Lung Health Study); we derived mixed-effects regression models to predict futureFEV 1 values over 11 years according to clinical traits. We modelled heterogeneity byallowing regression coefficients to vary across individuals. Two independent cohorts withCOPD were used for validating the equations. Results: We used data from 5594 patients(mean age 48.4 yr; 63% men; mean baseline FEV 1 2.75 L) to create the individualizedprediction equations.

Optimal clip ordering for multi-clip queries,Raymond T Ng; Paul Shum,Abstract. A multi-clip query requests multiple video clips be returned as the answer of thequery. In many applications and situations; the order in which these clips are to be delivereddoes not matter that much to the user. This allows the system ample opportunities tooptimize system throughput by using schedules that maximize the effect of piggybacking. Inthis paper; we study how to find such optimal schedules. In particular; we consider twooptimization criteria:(i) one based on maximizing the number of piggybacked clips; and (ii)the other based on maximizing the impact on buffer space. We show that the optimalschedule under the first criterion is equivalent to a maximum matching in a suitably definedbipartite graph; and that under the second criterion; the optimal schedule is equivalent to amaximum matching in a suitably defined weighted bipartite graph.

Network-based analysis reveals novel gene signatures in peripheral blood of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,Yunlong Nie; Virginia Chen; Casey P Shannon; Anand Kumar Andiappan; Bernett Lee; Olaf Rotzschke; Peter J Castaldi; Craig P Hersh; Nick Fishbane; Raymond T Ng; Bruce McManus; Bruce E Miller; Stephen Rennard; Peter D Paré; Don D Sin,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently the third leading cause of deathand there is a huge unmet clinical need to identify disease biomarkers in peripheral blood.Compared to gene level differential expression approaches to identify gene signatures;network analyses provide a biologically intuitive approach which leverages the co-expression patterns in the transcriptome to identify modules of co-expressed genes. Aweighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied to peripheral bloodtranscriptome from 238 COPD subjects to discover co-expressed gene modules. We thendetermined the relationship between these modules and forced expiratory volume in 1 s(FEV1). In a second; independent cohort of 381 subjects; we determined the preservation ofthese modules and their relationship with FEV1.

Modeling content and structure for abstractive review summarization,Shima Gerani; Giuseppe Carenini; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Reviews are valuable sources of information for many important decision makingtasks. Summarizing the massive amount of reviews; which are available these days on manyentities and services; is critical to help users better digest the sentiment about an entity or aservice and its aspects (ie features of the entity or the service). This article presents a novelaspect-based summarization framework that generates an abstract from multiple reviews ofan entity without the need for a handcrafted feature taxonomy or any training data. Wegenerate summaries using Natural Language Generation (NLG) by taking into account theimportance of aspects; as well as the association between them. We model theseinformation in the form of a tree; called Aspect Hierarchy Tree (AHT); in which nodes indicatethe important aspects and edges indicate the relationship between them.

Clinical; epidemiological and increasingly“omics” studies assess or adjust for current smoking status using only self-report; which maybe inaccurate. Objective measures such as exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO) may also beproblematic owing to limitations in the measurements and the relatively short half life of themolecule. In this study; we determined the impact of different case definitions of currentcigarette smoking on gene expression in peripheral blood of patients with COPD. Methods:Peripheral blood gene expression from 573 former-and current-smokers with COPD in theECLIPSE study was used to find genes whose expression was associated with smokingstatus.

Aggregate query processing in the presence of duplicates in wireless sensor networks,Jun-Ki Min; Raymond T Ng; Kyuseok Shim,Abstract Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have received increasing attention in the pastdecade. In existing studies for query processing of WSNs; each sensor node measuresenvironmental parameters such as temperature; light and humidity around its location.Instead; in our work; we consider a different type of sensors that detect objects in theirsensing regions which may overlap with each other. In WSNs with such sensors; an objectmay be detected by several sensor nodes and processing of aggregate queries (such asCOUNT; SUM and AVERAGE) becomes problematic since an identical object can beconsidered redundantly. In this paper; we propose efficient algorithms for processingaggregate queries as well as sliding window aggregate queries in the presence of multiplydetected events. To perform de-duplication; our proposed algorithms identify potential …,Information Sciences,2015,4

Incompleteness in Data Mining.,Hosagrahar Visvesvaraya Jagadish; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Database technology; as well as the bulk of data mining technology; is foundedupon logic; with absolute notions of truth and falsehood; at least with respect to the data set.Patterns are discovered exhaustively; with carefully engineered algorithms devised todetermine all patterns in a data set that belong to a certain class. For large data sets; manysuch data mining techniques are extremely expensive; leading to considerable researchtowards solving these problems more cheaply. In this paper; we argue that the central goalof data mining is to find sOME interesting patterns; and not necessarily ALL of them. As such;techniques that can find most of the answers cheaply are clearly more valuable thancomputationally much more expensive techniques that can guarantee completeness. In fact;it is probably the case that patterns that can be found cheaply are indeed the most …,Lecture notes in computer science,2001,4
Dempster-Shafer logic programs and stable semantics,Raymond Ng; VS Subrahmanian,Abstract Many researchers (eg Baldwin [2] and Ishizuka [19]) have observed that theDempster-Shafer rule of combination; which is at the heart of Dempster-Shafer theory;exhibits non-monotonic behaviour. However; as they focus entirely on operational concerns;two important issues remain unresolved. In [13]; Fitting observes that developing adeclarative semantics for logic programs based on the Dempster-Shafer rule is an openproblem. More importantly; it is unclear how the mode of non-monotonicity demonstrated bythe Dempster-Shafer rule is related to well-understood nonmonotonic logics. In this paperwe study Dempster-Shafer logic programs (DS-programs for short). We first develop adeclarative semantics for such logic programs. This task alone is complicated by the non-monotonic nature of the Dempster-Shafer rule. Then; given a DS-program P; we transform …,*,1993,4

Enumerateblood–an R package to estimate the cellular composition of whole blood from Affymetrix Gene ST gene expression profiles,Casey P Shannon; Robert Balshaw; Virginia Chen; Zsuzsanna Hollander; Mustafa Toma; Bruce M McManus; J Mark FitzGerald; Don D Sin; Raymond T Ng; Scott J Tebbutt,Measuring genome-wide changes in transcript abundance in circulating peripheral wholeblood is a useful way to study disease pathobiology and may help elucidate the molecularmechanisms of disease; or discovery of useful disease biomarkers. The sensitivity andinterpretability of analyses carried out in this complex tissue; however; are significantlyaffected by its dynamic cellular heterogeneity. It is therefore desirable to quantify thisheterogeneity; either to account for it or to better model interactions that may be presentbetween the abundance of certain transcripts; specific cell types and the indication understudy. Accurate enumeration of the many component cell types that make up peripheralwhole blood can further complicate the sample collection process; however; and result inadditional costs.

Isoform-selective inhibitor of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) limits pancreatic islet infiltration and protects female nonobese diabetic mice from diabetes,Ercument Dirice; Raymond WS Ng; Rachael Martinez; Jiang Hu; Florence F Wagner; Edward B Holson; Bridget K Wagner; Rohit N Kulkarni,Abstract Preservation of insulin-secreting β-cells is an important goal for therapies aimed atrestoring normoglycemia in patients with diabetes. One approach; the inhibition of histonedeacetylases (HDACs); has been reported to suppress pancreatic islet inflammation and β-cell apoptosis in vitro. In this report; we demonstrate the efficacy of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi)in vivo. We show that daily administration of BRD3308; an isoform-selective HDAC3inhibitor; for 2 weeks to female nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice; beginning at 3 weeks of age;followed by twice-weekly injections until age 25 weeks; protects the animals from diabetes.The preservation of β-cells was because of a significant decrease in islet infiltration ofmononuclear cells.

Finding Topics in Emails: Is LDA enough?,Shafiq Joty; Giuseppe Carenini; Gabriel Murray; Raymond Ng,Abstract Our research addresses the task of finding topics at the sentence level in emailconversations. As an asynchronous collaborative application; email has its owncharacteristics which differ from written monologues (eg; text books; news articles) or spokendialogs (eg; meetings). Hence; the generative topic models like Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) and its variations; which are successful in finding topics in monologue or dialog; maynot be successful by themselves in asynchronous written conversations like emails.However; an effective combination of LDA with other important features can give us thedesired results. We first point out the specific characteristics of emails that we need toconsider in order to find the inherent topics discussed in an email conversation.

EXQUISI: an expressive query interface for similar images,Dwifiandika S Faulus; Raymond T Ng,With the advances in digital imaging and storage technologies; image is becoming acommon type of data in many applications. This creates a demand to manage thesedatabase of images. One of the issues is in providing a query interface to allow an effectiveand efficient retrieval. Our study in this issue has led to the development of a query interfacesystem which we call Exquisi. The main contribution of Exquisi is an expressive querylanguage and interface that allow effective querying from a database of similar images. Inparticular; it provides querying tools for a user to express subtle differences that may existbetween images to be retrieved and other images that are similar. The query interface alsoallows the user to incorporate ambiguities and imprecisions in specifying his/her query.Another important aspect of Exquisi is the provision of a reformulation language by which …,Storage and Retrieval for Still Image and Video Databases IV,1996,2
PGCA: An algorithm to link protein groups created from MS/MS data,David Kepplinger; Mandeep Takhar; Mayu Sasaki; Zsuzsanna Hollander; Derek Smith; Bruce McManus; W Robert McMaster; Raymond T Ng; Gabriela V Cohen Freue,The quantitation of proteins using shotgun proteomics has gained popularity in the lastdecades; simplifying sample handling procedures; removing extensive protein separationsteps and achieving a relatively high throughput readout. The process starts with thedigestion of the protein mixture into peptides; which are then separated by liquidchromatography and sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). At the end of theworkflow; recovering the identity of the proteins originally present in the sample is often adifficult and ambiguous process; because more than one protein identifier may match a setof peptides identified from the MS/MS spectra. To address this identification problem; manyMS/MS data processing software tools combine all plausible protein identifiers matching acommon set of peptides into a protein group.

Training Data Enrichment for Infrequent Discourse Relations,Kailang Jiang; Giuseppe Carenini; Raymond Ng,Abstract Discourse parsing is a popular technique widely used in text understanding;sentiment analysis and other NLP tasks. However; for most discourse parsers; theperformance varies significantly across different discourse relations. In this paper; we firstvalidate the underfitting hypothesis; ie; the less frequent a relation is in the training data; thepoorer the performance on that relation. We then explore how to increase the number ofpositive training instances; without resorting to manually creating additional labeled data.We propose a training data enrichment framework that relies on co-training of two differentdiscourse parsers on unlabeled documents. Importantly; we show that co-training alone isnot sufficient. The framework requires a filtering step to ensure that only “good quality”unlabeled documents can be used for enrichment and re-training.

In a Business Intelligent scenario;our interface could support the analysis of real-time conversation occurring for instance inblogs; discussion fora; or in sites intended to collect customer feedback. The design of ourinterface aims to effectively combine the power of human perceptual and cognitive skills withthe ability of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to mine and summarize text.Since we are targeting a large user population; with no; or minimal expertise in dataanalysis; we selected interface elements based on simple and common visual metaphors …,International Workshop on Business Intelligence for the Real-Time Enterprise,2012,1

Exploiting Conversation Features for Finding Topics in Emails,Shafiq Joty; Giuseppe Carenini; Gabriel Murray; Raymond Ng,Abstract Our ongoing research addresses the task of finding topics at the sentence level inemail conversations. We first describe how the existing topic models can be applied to thisproblem. Then we demonstrate why the existing methods are inadequate for this task andwhat more we need to consider. With an experiment we further show that conversationstructure in the form of fragment quotation graph can be helpful for finding topics. To thisend; we propose a novel graph-theoretic framework to solve the problem. Crucial to ourproposed approach is that it captures the rich conversation features and integrates thestrengths of the supervised approach with the unsupervised technique.,Proceedings of the 2010 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing; MIT; Cambridge MA,2010,1
Clinical Validation and Biomarker Translation,David Lin; Andreas Scherer; Raymond Ng; Robert Balshaw; Shawna Flynn; Paul Keown; Robert McMaster; Bruce McManus,Abstract Many of the biomarkers in current clinical use have become accepted via debate;consensus; or merely the passage of time. Biomarkers can no longer become accepted inthis way; as they would fail to meet the current regulatory standards of modern medicine.Contemporary biomarkers must be tested in highly regulated human clinical trials.

The optimized segment support map for the mining of frequent patterns,Carson Kai-Sang Leung; Raymond T Ng; Heikki Mannila,Abstract Computing the frequency of a pattern is a key operation in data mining algorithms.We describe a simple; yet powerful; way of speeding up any form of frequency countingsatisfying the monotonicity condition. Our method; the optimized segment support map(OSSM); is based on a simple observation about data: Real life data sets are not necessarilybe uniformly distributed. The OSSM is a light-weight structure that partitions the collection oftransactions into m segments; so as to reduce the number of candidate patterns that requirefrequency counting. We study the following problems:(i) What is the optimal value of m; thenumber of segments to be used (the segment minimization problem)?(ii) Given a user-determined m; what is the best segmentation/composition of the m segments (theconstrained segmentation problem)? For the segment minimization problem; we provide …,*,2001,1
CASCON'98 Workshop Report Detecting Outliers in Large Data Sets,Raymond Ng,Knowledge discovery tasks can be classified into four general categories:(a) dependencydetection;(b) class identification;(c) class description; and (d) exception/outlier detection. Thefirst three categories of tasks correspond to patterns that apply to many objects; or to a largepercentage of objects; in the data set. Most studies in data mining (eg; association rulesclassification; clustering and concept generalization) belong to these 3 categories. Thefourth category; in contrast; focuses on a very small percentage of data objects; which areoften ignored or discarded as noise. For example; some existing algorithms in machinelearning and data mining have considered outliers; but only to the extent of tolerating themin whatever the algorithms are supposed to do. However;``one person's noise is anotherperson's signal.''Indeed; for some applications; the rare events are often more interesting …,*,1999,1
Incremental algorithms for optimizing model computation based on partial instantiation,Raymond T Ng; Xiaomei Tian,Abstract It has been shown that mixed integer programming methods can effectively supportminimal model; stable model and well-founded model semantics for ground deductivedatabases. Recently; a novel approach called partial instantiation has been developedwhich; when integrated with mixed integer programming methods; can handle non-groundlogic programs. The goal of this paper is to explore how this integrated framework based onpartial instantiation can be optimized. In particular; we develop an incremental algorithm thatminimizes repetitive computations. We also develop several optimization techniques tofurther enhance the efficiency of our incremental algorithm. Experimental results indicatethat our algorithm and optimization techniques can bring about very significant improvementin run-time performance.,The Journal of Logic Programming,1997,1

This leads toa need for data reduction. There are many di erent approaches to this problem; some ofthem not traditionally posed as solutions to a data reduction problem. In this paper wedescribe and evaluate several popular techniques for data reduction. Historically; theprimary need for data reduction has been internal to a database system; in a cost-basedquery optimizer. The need is for the query optimizer to estimate the cost of alternative queryplans cheaply {clearly the e ort required to do so must be much smaller than the e ort ofactually executing the query; and yet the cost of executing any query plan depends stronglyupon the numerosity of speci ed attribute values and the selectivities of speci ed predicates.To address these query optimizer needs; many databases keep summary statistics …,Bulletin of the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Data Engineering,1997,1
Performing boundary shape matching in spatial data,Edwin M Knorr; Raymond T Ng; David L Shilvock,Abstract This paper describes a new approach to knowledge discovery among spatialobjects-namely that of partial boundary shape matching. Our focus is on mining spatial data;whereby many objects called features (represented as polygons) are compared with one ormore point sets called clusters. The research described has practical application in suchdomains as Geographic Information Systems; in which a cluster of points (possibly createdby an SQL query) is compared to many natural or man-made features to detect partial ortotal matches of the facing boundaries of the cluster and feature. We begin by using analpha-shape to characterize the shape of an arbitrary cluster of points; thus producing a setof edges denoting the cluster's boundary. We then provide an approach for detecting aboundary shape match between the facing curves of the cluster and feature; and show …,Proceedings of the 1996 conference of the Centre for Advanced Studies on Collaborative research,1996,1

Immunological Serum Protein Profiles for Noninvasive Detection of Acute Cellular Rejection After Heart Transplantation,Ihdina Sukma Dewi; Olof Gidlöf; Zsuzsanna Hollander; Karen K Lam; Mark D Benson; Oscar O Braun; Johan Nilsson; Scott J Tebbutt; Raymond T Ng; Jenny Öhman; Bruce M McManus; J Gustav Smith,Acute cellular rejection (ACR); a T-cell–mediated form of organ rejection; remains a commonproblem after transplantation that compromises long-term allograft survival. Surveillance forACR has been based on endomyocardial biopsy since the 1970s; which is burdensome dueto its invasiveness; risk of complications; significant cost; interobserver variability; and risk offalse negative findings. Circulating biomarkers reflecting inflammation or myocardial injury;such as C-reactive protein or troponins; are not recommended for rejection surveillance dueto poor specificity (1).

Although diverse computational andstatistical approaches have been devised to identify such modules; their performancebehavior is still not fully understood; particularly in complex human tissues. Given humanheterogeneity; one important question is how the outputs of these computational methodsare sensitive to the input sample set; or stability. A related question is how this sensitivitydepends on the size of the sample set.

Biomarkers for recovered heart function,*,Heart failure (HF) represents a disease with high mortality and morbidity rates. Due to the highprevalence; HF causes a big overall economic and social burden. In the United Statesalone; there were 5.8 million HF patients in 2006; and the estimated direct and indirect costsrelated to HF in the United States were $39.2 billion in 2010. Although the incidence of HF inthe last decade has not decreased; survival rates have improved. As the population grows olderand heart disease fatality rates decrease due to better treatment methods; the number of patientswith HF continues to increase. In addition; HF treatment has also improved during the past threedecades; leading to a growing number of patients with recovered heart function. However; undercurrent clinical practice; these patients continue to be followed by heart failure specialists or cardiologistsand their treatment is ongoing.

A decadelater; there was a shift to more interactive content that presented how the business wasperforming at the present time; answering questions like" How are we doing right now?"Today the focus of BI users are looking into the future." Given what I did before and how I amcurrently doing this quarter; how will I do next quarter?" Furthermore; fuelled by the demandsof Big Data; BI systems are going through a time of incredible change.

Methods of diagnosing chronic cardiac allograft rejection,*,Transplantation is considered the primary therapy for patients with end-stage vital organfailure. While the availability of immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine and Tacrolimus hasimproved allograft recipient survival and wellbeing; identification of rejection of the allograft asearly and as accurately as possible; and effective monitoring and adjusting immunosuppressivemedication doses is still of primary importance to the continuing survival of the allograftrecipient … Rejection of an allograft may be generally described as the result of recipient's immuneresponse to nonself antigens expressed by the donor tissues.

Predicting Acute Cardiac Allograft Rejection Using Donor and Recipient Gene Expression,Zsuzsanna Hollander; Virginia Chen; David Lin; Raymond T Ng; Robert Balshaw; Andrew Ignaszewski; Gabriela Cohen Freue; Janet Wilson-McManus; Robert W McMaster; Paul Keown; Bruce M McManus,Background The occurrence of acute allograft rejection in cardiac transplant patients is still acontributing factor to the limited survival of the implanted heart. Currently; there are nobiomarkers in clinical use that can predict; at time of transplantation; the likelihood of post-transplantation acute rejection. Therefore; the Biomarkers in Transplantation (BiT) initiativeset out to discover biomarkers that could predict; before transplantation; the risk of rejectionin order to allow for a more personalized clinical management of transplant patients.Methods As a first step; seven clinical variables measured pre-transplantation wereinvestigated for their power to predict post-transplantation rejection in a larger cohort ofpatients.

The biomarker panels identified by BiT werediscovered in whole blood microarrays. However; the high-performance gene array is notpractical in clinic. Instead; rapid measurement of 20 to 50 genes using fully-automatedinstruments is required. In order to accurately measure biomarker gene expression withsuch technology; internal reference control genes are required to normalize the biomarkergene panel expression levels.

Privacy-Preserving Data Publishing: A Constraint-Based Clustering Approach,Anthony KH Tung; Jiawei Han; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Privacy-preserving data publishing has drawn much research interest recently. Inthis chapter; we address this topic from the viewpoint of constrained clustering; ie; theproblem of finding clusters that satisfy certain user-specified constraints. More specifically;we begin with the problem of clustering under aggregate constraints (without privacyconsiderations) and explain how traditional algorithms for the unconstrained problem (eg;the c-means algorithm) break down in the presence of constraints. From there; we developscalable algorithms that overcome this problem and finally illustrate how our algorithm canalso be used for privacy-preserving data publishing.,Constrained Clustering: Advances in Algorithms; Theory; and Applications,2008,*

P2-005: Expression networks regulated by gene dosage in lung adenocarcinoma,Raj Chari; Bradley P Coe; Raymond T Ng; Calum MacAulay; John Yee; John C English; Stephen Lam; Wan L Lam,Background Adenocarcinoma (AC) is the most common lung cancer cell type in manycountries. Identification of genes such as EGFR has demonstrated the importance ofdefining primary pathway alterations for the development of new AC treatments. However;genes altered at the expression level may be a result of reactive changes throughcomplicated regulation by other genes. Thus; genes whose expression is regulated byalterations in gene dosage (copy number) are attractive targets for therapeutic interventionas they likely represent the primary alterations in cancer development.

PD2-1-7: Differences in the gene expression profiles of tumors from patients with and without COPD,Julia M Chae; John Yee; Calum MacAulay; Stephen Lam; Wan L Lam; John English; Raymond T Ng,Background Cigarette smoke is the major cause of lung cancer; the leading cause of cancerdeaths; and COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease); the fourth leading cause ofdeath in the United States. There is now a large body of evidence to indicate that smokerswith COPD have increased risk of developing lung cancer. Studies have shown that theincidence of lung cancer in smokers with COPD is about 4 times higher than in smokerswithout COPD that have been matched for age; sex; occupation; and smoking history. Thechronic airway inflammation associated with COPD may create a pulmonary micro-environment that promotes cellular proliferation and carcinogenesis. In order to identifygenes which are specifically deregulated in lung cancer; one needs to consider COPD asone of the confounding factors to create normal expression baseline.

These findings will enhance theunderstanding of normal lung function and provide a baseline to study lung malignancies.Design; Materials and Methods: RNA was isolated from bronchial brushings of normalhuman bronchial epithelium from individuals with a heavy smoking history and 21 SAGElibraries were constructed; containing nearly 2;000;000 sequence tags. 21 publicly …,*,2006,*
A machine learning approach to finding gene expression signatures of the early developmental stages of squamous cell lung carcinoma,Scott D Zuyderduyn; Kim Lonergan; Greg P Vatcher; Steven Jm Jones; Stephen Lam; Wan Lam; Calum Macaulay; Marco A Marra; Raymond Ng; Victor Ling,1832 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in North America. Squamous cell(SqC) carcinoma is a distinct subtype of lung cancer that comprises about 35% of totalcases. The developmental stages of this subtype have been well-characterized by histology.However; the genetic changes that occur through these stages are not fully understood. Inthis study; we examined if the application of a combination of statistical methods could resultin consistent signatures of expressed genes; predictive of commitment to more malignantphenotypes. We generated 31 serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) profiles fromseveral of the developmental stages of squamous cell lung carcinoma (bronchial epitheliumfrom 11 former smokers and 9 from current smokers; 1 squamous metaplasia; 5 carcinomain situ (cis); and 5 invasive carcinoma).

Sequential Pattern Mining Algorithms with Quantities,Chul-Yun Kim; Jong-Hwa Lim; Raymond T Ng; Kyu-Seok Shim,Abstract Discovering sequential patterns is an important problem for many applications.Existing algorithms find sequential patterns in the sense that only items are included in thepatterns. However; for many applications; such as business and scientific applications;quantitative attributes are often recorded in the data; which are ignored by existingalgorithms but can provide useful insight to the users. In this paper; we consider the problemof mining sequential patterns with quantities. We demonstrate that naive extensions toexisting algorithms for sequential patterns are inefficient; as they may enumerate the searchspace blindly. Thus; we propose hash filtering and quantity sampling techniques thatsignificantly improve the performance of the naive extensions. Experimental results confirmthat compared with the naive extensions; these schemes not only improve the execution …,Journal of KIISE: Databases,2006,*

Specific therapy is currentlyunavailable. Viral myocarditis is a complex; multiphasic infectious-inflammatory-reparativeprocess. To address the temporal dimensionality of myocarditis; array-and nonarray-basedmolecular techniques; and histological and functional assays were used to help defineenteroviral pathogenesis and its relation to heart failure. The application of high throughputgenomic strategies and bioinformatics tools–coupled with established molecular techniques–have allowed us to perform a large-scale analysis of gene expression to better understandthe host response to viral infection.

GEA: a toolkit for gene expression analysis,Jessica M Phan; Raymond Ng; Man Saint Yuen; Steve Jones,Abstract In recent years; relating gene expression to cancer development and treatment hasreceived a lot of attention. Unfortunately; the availability of effective analysis tools lacks farbehind the availability of data. In this paper; we present the Gene Expression Analyzer(GEA) for performing cluster analysis on gene expression data. In particular; the GEA isdeveloped to support the reality that cluster analysis is typically a multi-step process. Theunderlying model of the GEA provides a set of algebraic operators for manipulating the data;as well as the intermediate results. Moreover; the GEA provides facilities to help the user toidentify candidate genes for further clinical analysis. Last but not least; the GEA is optimizedto handle the high dimensionality of gene expression data.,Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Data Mining in Bioinformatics,2002,*

Generalizing Temporal Dependencies for Non-Temporal Dimensions,Jef Wijsen; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Recently; there has been a lot of interest in temporal granularity; and itsapplications in temporal dependency theory and data mining. Generalization hierarchiesused in multi-dimensional databases and OLAP serve a role similar to that of timegranularity in temporal databases; but they also apply to non-temporal dimensions; likespace. In this paper; we first generalize temporal functional dependencies for non-temporaldimensions; which leads to the notion of roll-up dependency (RUD). We show theapplicability of RUDs in conceptual modeling and data mining. We then indicate that thenotion of time granularity used in temporal databases is generally more expressive than thegeneralization hierarchies in multi-dimensional databases; and show how this surplusexpressiveness can be introduced in non-temporal dimensions; which leads to the …,History,1999,*

FOR MPEG STREAMS,Raymond T Ng; Rita Dilek,ABSTRACT Most of the existing analyses on admission control and buffer management forcontinuous media streams assume fixed data compression rates. This assumption is validfor schemes such as JPEG; but is invalid for methods such as MPEG. With the gainingacceptance of MPEG and the development of new; more efficient variable compression ratetechniques; there is a need for new models; analyses and algorithms for streams withvariable compression rates. The Central Limit Theorem of statistics has been proposed foruse at the granularity level of data streams to handle the management of concurrentstreams. The key implication is that the total amount of buffer space required by all streamsat a particular point in time is approximately normally distributed. In this chapter; we showhow to apply the Central Limit Theorem at the finer granularity level of frames. This gives …,Multimedia Information Storage and Management,1996,*

Incremental methods for optimizing partial instantiation,Raymond T Ng; Xiaomei Tian,Abstract It has been shown that mixed integer programming methods can effectively supportminimal model; stable model and well-founded model semantics for ground deductivedatabases. Recently; a novel approach called partial instantiation has been developedwhich; when integrated with mixed integer programming methods; can handle non-groundlogic programs. The goal of this paper is to explore how this integrated framework based onpartial instantiation can be optimized. In particular; we develop an incremental algorithm thatminimizes repetitive computations. We also develop optimization techniques to furtherenhance the efficiency of our incremental algorithm. Experimental results indicate that ouralgorithm and optimization techniques can bring about very significant improvement in run-time performance.,International Conference on Logic Programming and Nonmonotonic Reasoning,1995,*

Reasoning with uncertainty in deductive databases and logic programs,Raymond Tak-yan Ng,Abstract Of all scientific investigations into reasoning with uncertainty and chance;probability theory is perhaps the best understood paradigm. Nevertheless; all studiesconducted thus far on the semantics of quantitative logic programming have been restrictedto non-probabilistic semantical characterizations. In this thesis; we develop a fewframeworks to rectify this situation. In the first part of our study; we introduce a deductivedatabase language which is expressive enough to represent such probabilistic relationshipsas conditional probabilities; Bayesian updates; probability propagation and mutualexclusion. We propose a fixpoint theory and a probabilistic model theory; and characterizetheir inter-relationships. Furthermore; we develop a proof procedure for this language; andpresent soundness and completeness results of this procedure.,*,1992,*
Data Engineering,William DuMouchel Barbará; Christos Faloutsos; Peter J Haas; Joseph M Hellerstein; Yannis Ioannidis; HV Jagadish; Theodore Johnson; Raymond Ng; Viswanath Poosala; Kenneth A Ross; Kenneth C Sevcik,There is often a need to get quick approximate answers from large databases. This leads toa need for data reduction. There are many different approaches to this problem; some ofthem not traditionally posed as solutions to a data reduction problem. In this paper wedescribe and evaluate several popular techniques for data reduction. Historically; theprimary need for data reduction has been internal to a database system; in a cost-basedquery optimizer. The need is for the query optimizer to estimate the cost of alternative queryplans cheaply–clearly the effort required to do so must be much smaller than the effort ofactually executing the query; and yet the cost of executing any query plan depends stronglyupon the numerosity of specified attribute values and the selectivities of specified predicates.To address these query optimizer needs; many databases keep summary statistics …,*,*,*

Weevaluate these approaches in a user study and find that they quantitatively perform equallywell. Qualitatively; we find that they perform well for different but complementary reasons.We conclude that an effective method for summarizing evaluative arguments must effectivelysynthesize the two approaches.,*,*,*

Exploratory Mining via Constrained Frequent Set Queries Raymond Ng U. of British Columbia rng@ cs. ubc. ca,Raymond Ng,Abstract Although there have been many studies on data mining; to date there have beenfew research prototypes or commercial systems supporting comprehensive query-drivenmining; which encourages interactive exploration of the data. Our thesis is that constraintconstructs and the optimization they induce play a pivotal role in mining queries; thussubstantially enhancing the usefulness and performance of the mining system. This is basedon the analogy of declarative query languages like SQL and query optimization which havemade relational databases so successful. To this end; our proposed demo is not yet anotherdata mining system; but of a new paradigm in data mining-mining with constraints; as theimportant first step towards supporting ad-hoc mining in DBMS.

Bu er Sharing Schemes for Continuous-Media Systems,Dwight J Makaro; Raymond T Ng,Abstract Bu er management in continuous-media systems is a frequently studied topic. Oneof the most interesting recent proposals is the idea of bu er sharing for concurrent streams.As analyzed in 8]; by taking advantage of the temporal behaviour of concurrent streams; buer sharing can lead to a 50% savings in total bu er space. In this paper; we study how toactually implement bu er sharing. To this end; we develop the CES Bu er Sharing schemethat is very e cient to implement; and that permits savings asymptotically very close to theideal savings predicted by the analysis in 8]. We show that the CES scheme can operate eectively under varying degrees of disk utilizations; and during transition periods when thenumber of concurrent streams changes. We also demonstrate how the scheme can befurther improved; particularly for situations when the number of concurrent streams is …,*,*,*

Indian Institute of Technology; Bombay University of British Columbia; Canada,C Gokhale; N Gupta; P Kumar; LVS Lakshmanan; R Ng; BA Prakash,The popularity of XML as a data exchange standard has led to the emergence of powerfulXML query languages like XQuery [21] and studies on XML query optimization. Of late; thereis considerable interest in analytical processing of XML data (eg;[2; 3]). As pointed out byBorkar and Carey in [3]; even for data integration; there is a compelling need for performingvarious group-by style aggregate operations. A core operator needed for analytics is thegroupby operator; which is widely used in relational as well as OLAP database applications.XQuery requires group-by operations to be simulated using nesting [2]. Studies addressingthe need for XML grouping fall into two broad categories:(1) Provide support for grouping atthe logical or physical level [6] and recognize grouping operations from nested queries andrewrite them with grouping operations [4; 5; 9; 12].(2) Extend XQuery FLWOR expressions …,*,*,*

Previous studies; primarily focusing on fastcomputation of one speci c mining task at a time; ignore this vital issue. Motivated by thisobservation; we develop a unied model supporting all major mining and analysis tasks. Ourmodel consists of three distinct worlds; corresponding to intensional and extensionaldimensions; and to data sets. The notion of dimension is a centerpiece of the model.Equipped with hierarchies; dimensions integrate the output of seemingly dissimilar miningand analysis operations in a clean manner.,*,*,*
