Klee: A framework for distributed top-k query algorithms,Sebastian Michel; Peter Triantafillou; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract This paper addresses the efficient processing of top-k queries in wide-areadistributed data repositories where the index lists for the attribute values (or text terms) of aquery are distributed across a number of data peers and the computational costs includenetwork latency; bandwidth consumption; and local peer work. We present KLEE; a novelalgorithmic framework for distributed top-k queries; designed for high performance andflexibility. KLEE makes a strong case for approximate top-k algorithms over widelydistributed data sources. It shows how great gains in efficiency can be enjoyed at low result-quality penalties. Further; KLEE affords the query-initiating peer the flexibility to trade-offresult quality and expected performance and to trade-off the number of communicationphases engaged during query execution versus network bandwidth performance.

Efficient top-k querying over social-tagging networks,Ralf Schenkel; Tom Crecelius; Mouna Kacimi; Sebastian Michel; Thomas Neumann; Josiane X Parreira; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract Online communities have become popular for publishing and searching content; aswell as for finding and connecting to other users. User-generated content includes; forexample; personal blogs; bookmarks; and digital photos. These items can be annotated andrated by different users; and these social tags and derived user-specific scores can beleveraged for searching relevant content and discovering subjectively interesting items.Moreover; the relationships among users can also be taken into consideration for rankingsearch results; the intuition being that you trust the recommendations of your close friendsmore than those of your casual acquaintances. Queries for tag or keyword combinations thatcompute and rank the top-k results thus face a large variety of options that complicate thequery processing and pose efficiency challenges.

Minerva: Collaborative p2p search,Matthias Bender; Sebastian Michel; Peter Triantafillou; Gerhard Weikum; Christian Zimmer,Abstract This paper proposes the live demonstration of a prototype of MINERVA; a novelP2P Web search engine. The search engine is layered on top of a DHT-based overlaynetwork that connects an a-priori unlimited number of peers; each of which maintains apersonal local database and a local search facility. Each peer posts a small amount ofmetadata to a physically distributed directory that is used to efficiently select promising peersfrom across the peer population that can best locally execute a query. The proposeddemonstration serves as a proof of concept for P2P Web search by deploying the project onstandard notebook PCs and also invites everybody to join the network by instantly installinga small piece of software from a USB memory stick.,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,160
Improving collection selection with overlap awareness in p2p search engines,Matthias Bender; Sebastian Michel; Peter Triantafillou; Gerhard Weikum; Christian Zimmer,Abstract Collection selection has been a research issue for years. Typically; in related work;precomputed statistics are employed in order to estimate the expected result quality of eachcollection; and subsequently the collections are ranked accordingly. Our thesis is that thissimple approach is insufficient for several applications in which the collections typicallyoverlap. This is the case; for example; for the collections built by autonomous peers crawlingthe web. We argue for the extension of existing quality measures using estimators of mutualoverlap among collections and present experiments in which this combination outperformsCORI; a popular approach based on quality estimation. We outline our prototypeimplementation of a P2P web search engine; coined MINERVA; that allows handling largeamounts of data in a distributed and self-organizing manner.

Exploiting social relations for query expansion and result ranking,Matthias Bender; Tom Crecelius; Mouna Kacimi; Sebastian Michel; Thomas Neumann; Josiane Xavier Parreira; Ralf Schenkel; Gerhard Weikum,Online communities have recently become a popular tool for publishing and searchingcontent; as well as for finding and connecting to other users that share common interests.The content is typically user-generated and includes; for example; personal blogs;bookmarks; and digital photos. A particularly intriguing type of content is user-generatedannotations (tags) for content items; as these concise string descriptions allow forreasonings about the interests of the user who created the content; but also about the userwho generated the annotations. This paper presents a framework to cast the different entitiesof such networks into a unified graph model representing the mutual relationships of users;content; and tags. It derives scoring functions for each of the entities and relations. We haveperformed an experimental evaluation on two real-world datasets (crawled from deli. cio …,Data engineering workshop; 2008.

Rankreduce-processing k-nearest neighbor queries on top of mapreduce,Aleksandar Stupar; Sebastian Michel; Ralf Schenkel,ABSTRACT We consider the problem of processing K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) queries overlarge datasets where the index is jointly maintained by a set of machines in a computingcluster. The proposed RankReduce approach uses locality sensitive hashing (LSH) togetherwith a MapReduce implementation; which by design is a perfect match as the hashingprinciple of LSH can be smoothly integrated in the mapping phase of MapReduce. The LSHalgorithm assigns similar objects to the same fragments in the distributed file system whichenables a effective selection of potential candidate neighbors which get then reduced to theset of K-Nearest Neighbors. We address problems arising due to the different characteristicsof MapReduce and LSH to achieve an efficient search process on the one hand and highLSH accuracy on the other hand. We discuss several pitfalls and detailed descriptions on …,Proceedings of the 8th Workshop on Large-Scale Distributed Systems for Information Retrieval,2010,92
Distributed similarity search in high dimensions using locality sensitive hashing,Parisa Haghani; Sebastian Michel; Karl Aberer,Abstract In this paper we consider distributed K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) search and rangequery processing in high dimensional data. Our approach is based on Locality SensitiveHashing (LSH) which has proven very efficient in answering KNN queries in centralizedsettings. We consider mappings from the multi-dimensional LSH bucket space to the linearlyordered set of peers that jointly maintain the indexed data and derive requirements toachieve high quality search results and limit the number of network accesses. We putforward two such mappings that come with these salient properties: being locality preservingso that buckets likely to hold similar data are stored on the same or neighboring peers andhaving a predictable output distribution to ensure fair load balancing. We show how toleverage the linearly aligned data for efficient KNN search and how to efficiently process …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,80
p2pDating: Real life inspired semantic overlay networks for web search,Josiane Xavier Parreira; Sebastian Michel; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract We consider a network of autonomous peers forming a logically global butphysically distributed search engine; where every peer has its own local collectiongenerated by independently crawling the Web. A challenging task in such systems is toefficiently route user queries to peers that can deliver high quality results and be able to rankthese returned results; thus satisfying the users' information need. However; the probleminherent with this scenario is selecting a few promising peers out of an a priori unlimitednumber of peers. In recent research a rather strict notion of semantic overlay networks hasbeen established. In most approaches; peers are connected to other peers based on a rigidsemantic profile by clustering them based on their contents. In contrast; our strategy followsthe spirit of peer autonomy and creates semantic overlay networks based on the notion of …,Information Processing & Management,2007,66
See what's enBlogue: real-time emergent topic identification in social media,Foteini Alvanaki; Sebastian Michel; Krithi Ramamritham; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract With the increasing popularity of Web 2.0 streams; people become overwhelmed bythe available information. This is partly countered by tagging blog posts and tweets; so thatusers can filter messages according to their tags. However; this is insufficient for detectingnewly emerging topics that are not reflected by a single tag but are rather expressed byunusual tag combinations. This paper presents enBlogue; an approach for automaticallydetecting such emergent topics. EnBlogue uses a time-sliding window to compute statisticsabout tags and tag-pairs. These statistics are then used to identify unusual shifts incorrelations; most of the time caused by real-world events. We analyze the strength of theseshifts and measure the degree of unpredictability they include; used to rank tag-pairsexpressing emergent topics. Additionally; this" indicator of surprise" is carried over to …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2012,62
P2P Content Search: Give the Web Back to the People.,Matthias Bender; Sebastian Michel; Peter Triantafillou; Gerhard Weikum; Christian Zimmer,ABSTRACT The proliferation of peer-to-peer (P2P) systems has come with variouscompelling applications including file sharing based on distributed hash tables (DHTs) orother kinds of overlay networks. Searching the content of files (especially Web Search)requires multi-keyword querying with scoring and ranking. Existing approaches have no wayof taking into account the correlation between the keywords in the query. This paperpresents our solution that incorporates the queries and behavior of the users in the P2Pnetwork such that interesting correlations can be inferred.,IPTPS,2006,59

We present the enBloguesystem for emergent topic detection. The name enBlogue reflects the analogy with emergingtrends in fashion often referred to as en Vogue. EnBlogue continuously monitors Web 2.0streams and keeps track of sudden changes in tag correlations which can be adjusted usingpersonalization to reflect particular user interests.

Discovering and exploiting keyword and attribute-value co-occurrences to improve P2P routing indices,Sebastian Michel; Matthias Bender; Nikos Ntarmos; Peter Triantafillou; Gerhard Weikum; Christian Zimmer,Abstract Peer-to-Peer (P2P) search requires intelligent decisions for query routing: selectingthe best peers to which a given query; initiated at some peer; should be forwarded forretrieving additional search results. These decisions are based on statistical summaries foreach peer; which are usually organized on a per-keyword basis and managed in adistributed directory of routing indices. Such architectures disregard the possiblecorrelations among keywords. Together with the coarse granularity of per-peer summaries;which are mandated for scalability; this limitation may lead to poor search result quality. Thispaper develops and evaluates two solutions to this problem; sk-STAT based on single-keystatistics only; and mk-STAT based on additional multi-key statistics. For both cases; hashsketch synopses are used to compactly represent a peer's data items and are efficiently …,Proceedings of the 15th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2006,52
Efficient and decentralized pagerank approximation in a peer-to-peer web search network,Josiane Xavier Parreira; Debora Donato; Sebastian Michel; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract PageRank-style (PR) link analyses are a cornerstone of Web search engines andWeb mining; but they are computationally expensive. Recently; various techniques havebeen proposed for speeding up these analyses by distributing the link graph among multiplesites. However; none of these advanced methods is suitable for a fully decentralized PRcomputation in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network with autonomous peers; where each peer canindependently crawl Web fragments according to the user's thematic interests. In such asetting the graph fragments that different peers have locally available or know about mayarbitrarily overlap among peers; creating additional complexity for the PR computation. Thispaper presents the JXP algorithm for dynamically and collaboratively computing PR scoresof Web pages that are arbitrarily distributed in a P2P network.

Evaluating top-k queries over incomplete data streams,Parisa Haghani; Sebastian Michel; Karl Aberer,Abstract We study the problem of continuous monitoring of top-k queries over multiple non-synchronized streams. Assuming a sliding window model; this general problem has been awell addressed research topic in recent years. Most approaches; however; assumesynchronized streams where all attributes of an object are known simultaneously to thequery processing engine. In many streaming scenarios though; different attributes of an itemare reported in separate non-synchronized streams which do not allow for exact scorecalculations. We present how the traditional notion of object dominance changes in this casesuch that the k dominance set still includes all and only those objects which have a chanceof being among the top-k results in their life time. Based on this; we propose an exactalgorithm which builds on generating multiple instances of the same object in a way that …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,50
Peer-to-peer information search: Semantic; social; or spiritual?,Matthias Bender; Tom Crecelius; Mouna Kacimi; Sebastian Michel; Josiane Xavier Parreira; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract We consider the network structure and query processing capabilities of socialcommunities like bookmarks and photo sharing communities such as del. icio. us or flickr. Acommon feature of all these networks is that the content is generated by the users and thatusers create social links with other users. The evolving network naturally resembles a peer-to-peer system; where the peers correspond to users. We consider the problem of queryrouting in such a peer-to-peer setting where peers are collaborating to form a distributedsearch engine. We have identified three query routing paradigms: semantic routing basedon query-to-content similarities; social routing based on friendship links within thecommunity; and spiritual routing based on user-to-user similarities such as shared interestsor similar behavior. We discuss how these techniques can be integrated into an existing …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2007,49

We identify the core principles underlying tag propagation for which we derivesuitable scoring models combined in one overall ranking formula.

Bookmark-driven Query Routing in Peer-to-Peer Web Search.,Matthias Bender; Sebastian Michel; Gerhard Weikum; Christian Zimmer,Abstract: We consider the problem of collaborative Web search and query routing strategiesin a peer-to-peer (P2P) environment. In our architecture every peer has a full-fledged searchengine with a (thematically focused) crawler and a local index whose contents may betailored to the user's specific interest profile. Peers are autonomous and post meta-information about their bookmarks and index lists to a global directory; which is efficientlyimplemented in a decentralized manner using Chordstyle distributed hash tables. A queryposed by one peer is first evaluated locally; if the result is unsatisfactory the query isforwarded to selected peers. These peers are chosen based on a benefit/cost measurewhere benefit reflects the thematic similarity of peers' interest profiles; derived frombookmarks; and cost captures estimated peer load and response time.

The gist of everything new: personalized top-k processing over web 2.0 streams,Parisa Haghani; Sebastian Michel; Karl Aberer,Abstract Web 2.0 portals have made content generation easier than ever with millions ofusers contributing news stories in form of posts in weblogs or short textual snippets as inTwitter. Efficient and effective filtering solutions are key to allow users stay tuned to this ever-growing ocean of information; releasing only relevant trickles of personal interest. Inclassical information filtering systems; user interests are formulated using standard IRtechniques and data from all available information sources is filtered based on a predefinedabsolute quality-based threshold. In contrast to this restrictive approach which may stilloverwhelm the user with the returned stream of data; we envision a system whichcontinuously keeps the user updated with only the top-k relevant new information.Freshness of data is guaranteed by considering it valid for a particular time interval …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,39
Sensor metadata management and its application in collaborative environmental research,Nicholas Dawes; K Ashwin Kumar; Sebastian Michel; Karl Aberer; Michael Lehning,This paper considers metadata generation and tracking in a collaborative environmentwhere users publish raw sensor data in the form of virtual sensors and post-process data bymeans of filtering; modeling; or query processing techniques. In the metadata systemdescribed; data from different sources with different provenance will be enriched with furthermetadata at each processing step to describe the processing implemented and/orobservations which may explain anomalies in the data. The management of this data is thesubject of this paper. In the context of sensor data processing; in particular in theenvironmental sciences; there is still a large gap between data acquisition and metadatagathering; further complicated by the problem of combining both. In this paper; an attempt ismade to bridge the gap between data management and semantic annotation. This paper …,eScience; 2008. eScience'08. IEEE Fourth International Conference on,2008,39
Minerva∞: A scalable efficient peer-to-peer search engine,Sebastian Michel; Peter Triantafillou; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract The promises inherent in users coming together to form data sharing networkcommunities; bring to the foreground new problems formulated over such dynamic; evergrowing; computing; storage; and networking infrastructures. A key open challenge is toharness these highly distributed resources toward the development of an ultra scalable;efficient search engine. From a technical viewpoint; any acceptable solution must fullyexploit all available resources dictating the removal of any centralized points of control;which can also readily lead to performance bottlenecks and reliability/availability problems.Equally importantly; however; a highly distributed solution can also facilitate pluralism ininforming users about internet content; which is crucial in order to preclude the formation ofinformation-resource monopolies and the biased visibility of content from economically …,Proceedings of the ACM/IFIP/USENIX 2005 International Conference on Middleware,2005,39
Iqn routing: Integrating quality and novelty in p2p querying and ranking,Sebastian Michel; Matthias Bender; Peter Triantafillou; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract We consider a collaboration of peers autonomously crawling the Web. A pivotalissue when designing a peer-to-peer (P2P) Web search engine in this environment is queryrouting: selecting a small subset of (a potentially very large number of relevant) peers tocontact to satisfy a keyword query. Existing approaches for query routing work well ondisjoint data sets. However; naturally; the peers' data collections often highly overlap; aspopular documents are highly crawled. Techniques for estimating the cardinality of theoverlap between sets; designed for and incorporated into information retrieval engines arevery much lacking. In this paper we present a comprehensive evaluation of appropriateoverlap estimators; showing how they can be incorporated into an efficient; iterativeapproach to query routing; coined Integrated Quality Novelty (IQN).

A reproducible benchmark for p2p retrieval,Thomas Neumann; Matthias Bender; Sebastian Michel; Gerhard Weikum; Philippe Bonnet; Ioana Manolescu,Abstract With the growing popularity of information retrieval (IR) in distributed systems and inparticular {P2P} Web search; a huge number of protocols and prototypes have beenintroduced in the literature. However; nearly every paper considers a different benchmark forits experimental evaluation; rendering their mutual comparison and the quantification ofperformance improvements an impossible task. We present a standardized; generalpurpose benchmark for {P2P IR} systems that finally makes this possible. We start bypresenting a detailed requirement analysis for such a standardized benchmark frameworkthat allows for reproducible and comparable experimental setups without sacrificingflexibility to suit different system models. We further suggest Wikipedia as a publicly-available and all-purpose document corpus and finally introduce a simple but yet flexible …,Untitled Event,2006,38

We present an efficient mapping scheme based onp-stable Locality Sensitive Hashing to assign hash buckets to peers in a Chord-style overlaynetwork. To minimize network traffic; we process queries in an incremental top-K fashionleveraging on a locality preserving mapping to the peer space. Furthermore; we considerload balancing by harnessing estimates of the resulting data mapping; which follows anormal distribution.

Global document frequency estimation in peer-to-peer web search,Matthias Bender; Sebastian Michel; Peter Triantafillou; Gerhard Weikum,This paper presents an efficient solution for the problem of estimating global documentfrequencies in a large-scale P2P network with very high dynamics where peers can join andleave the network on short notice. In particular; the developed method takes into account thefact that the local document collections of autonomous peers may arbitrarily overlap; so thatglobal counting needs to be duplicateinsensitive. The method is based on hash sketches asa technique for compact data synopses. Experimental studies demonstrate the estimator'saccuracy; scalability; and ability to cope with high dynamics. Moreover; the benefit forranking P2P search results is shown by experiments with real-world Web data and queries.,Proc. of the 9th Int. Workshop on the web and databases,2006,34

The juxtaposed approximate pagerank method for robust pagerank approximation in a peer-to-peer web search network,Josiane Xavier Parreira; Carlos Castillo; Debora Donato; Sebastian Michel; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract We present Juxtaposed approximate PageRank (JXP); a distributed algorithm forcomputing PageRank-style authority scores of Web pages on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network.Unlike previous algorithms; JXP allows peers to have overlapping content and requires no apriori knowledge of other peers' content. Our algorithm combines locally computed authorityscores with information obtained from other peers by means of random meetings among thepeers in the network. This computation is based on a Markov-chain state-lumping technique;and iteratively approximates global authority scores. The algorithm scales with the numberof peers in the network and we show that the JXP scores converge to the true PageRankscores that one would obtain with a centralized algorithm. Finally; we show how to deal withmisbehaving peers by extending JXP with a reputation model.,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2008,30
Distributed top-k aggregation queries at large,Thomas Neumann; Matthias Bender; Sebastian Michel; Ralf Schenkel; Peter Triantafillou; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract Top-k query processing is a fundamental building block for efficient ranking in alarge number of applications. Efficiency is a central issue; especially for distributed settings;when the data is spread across different nodes in a network. This paper introduces noveloptimization methods for top-k aggregation queries in such distributed environments. Theoptimizations can be applied to all algorithms that fall into the frameworks of the prior TPUTand KLEE methods. The optimizations address three degrees of freedom: 1) hierarchicallygrouping input lists into top-k operator trees and optimizing the tree structure; 2) computingdata-adaptive scan depths for different input sources; and 3) data-adaptive sampling of asmall subset of input sources in scenarios with hundreds or thousands of query-relevantnetwork nodes.

From Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 and back-: how did your grandma use to tag?,Sheila Kinsella; Adriana Budura; Gleb Skobeltsyn; Sebastian Michel; John G Breslin; Karl Aberer,Abstract We consider the applicability of terms extracted from anchortext as a source of Webpage descriptions in the form of tags. With a relatively simple and easy-to-use method; weshow that anchortext significantly overlaps with tags obtained from the popular taggingportal del. icio. us. Considering the size and diversity of the user community potentiallyinvolved in social tagging; this observation is rather surprising. Furthermore; we show by anevaluation using human-created relevance assessments the general suitability of theanchortext tag generation in terms of user-perceived precision values. The awareness of thiseasy-to-obtain source of tags could trigger the rise of new tagging portals pushed by thisautomatic bootstrapping process or be applied in already existing portals to increase thenumber of tags per page by merely looking at the anchortext which exists anyway.,Proceedings of the 10th ACM workshop on Web information and data management,2008,15

Continuous query evaluation over distributed sensor networks,Oana Jurca; Sebastian Michel; Alexandre Herrmann; Karl Aberer,In this paper we address the problem of processing continuous multi-join queries; overdistributed data streams. Our approach makes use of existing work in the field ofpublish/subscribe systems. We show how these principles can be ported to our envisionedarchitectural model by enriching the common query model with location dependentattributes. We allow users to subscribe to a set of sensor attributes; a service that requiresprocessing multi-join correlation queries. The goal is to decrease the overall network trafficconsumption by removing redundant subscriptions and eliminating unrequested eventsclose to the publishing sensors. This is non-trivial; especially in the presence of multi-joinqueries without any central control mechanism.

Making SENSE: socially enhanced search and exploration,Tom Crecelius; Mouna Kacimi; Sebastian Michel; Thomas Neumann; Josiane Xavier Parreira; Ralf Schenkel; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract Online communities like Flickr; del. icio. us and YouTube have establishedthemselves as very popular and powerful services for publishing and searching contents;but also for identifying other users who share similar interests. In these communities; dataare usually annotated with carefully selected and often semantically meaningful tags;collaboratively chosen by the user who uploaded an item and other users who came acrossthe item. Items like urls or videos are typically retrieved by issueing queries that consist of aset of tags; returning items that have been frequently annotated with these tags. However;users often prefer a more personalized way of searching over such a'global'search;exploiting preferences of and connections between users.

On the usage of global document occurrences in peer-to-peer information systems,Odysseas Papapetrou; Sebastian Michel; Matthias Bender; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract There exist a number of approaches for query processing in Peer-to-Peerinformation systems that efficiently retrieve relevant information from distributed peers.However; very few of them take into consideration the overlap between peers: as the mostpopular resources (eg; documents or files) are often present at most of the peers; a largefraction of the documents eventually received by the query initiator are duplicates. Wedevelop a technique based on the notion of global document occurrences (GDO) that; whenprocessing a query; penalizes frequent documents increasingly as more and more peerscontribute their local results. We argue that the additional effort to create and maintain theGDO information is reasonably low; as the necessary information can be piggybacked ontothe existing communication. Early experiments indicate that our approach significantly …,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2005,11

The essence of knowledge (bases) through entity rankings,Evica Ilieva; Sebastian Michel; Aleksandar Stupar,Abstract We consider the task of automatically phrasing and computing top-k rankings overthe information contained in common knowledge bases (KBs); such as YAGO or DBPedia.We assemble the thematic focus and ranking criteria of rankings by inspecting the presentSubject; Predicate; Object (SPO) triples. Making use of numerical attributes contained in theKB we are also able to compute the actual ranking content; ie; entities and theirperformances. We further discuss the integration of existing rankings into the rankinggeneration process for increased coverage and ranking quality. We report on first resultsobtained using the YAGO knowledge base.,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Conference on information & knowledge management,2013,8

SRbench--a benchmark for soundtrack recommendation systems,Aleksandar Stupar; Sebastian Michel,Abstract In this work; a benchmark to evaluate the retrieval performance of soundtrackrecommendation systems is proposed. Such systems aim at finding songs that are played asbackground music for a given set of images. The proposed benchmark is based onpreference judgments; where relevance is considered a continuous ordinal variable andjudgments are collected for pairs of songs with respect to a query (ie; set of images). Tocapture a wide variety of songs and images; we use a large space of possible music genres;different emotions expressed through music; and various query-image themes. Thebenchmark consists of two types of relevance assessments:(i) judgments obtained from auser study; that serve as a``gold standard''for (ii) relevance judgments gathered throughAmazon's Mechanical Turk.

Design alternatives for large-scale web search: Alexander was great; aeneas a pioneer; and anakin has the force,Matthias Bender; Sebastian Michel; Peter Triantafillou; Gerhard Weikum,ABSTRACT Indexing the Web and meeting the throughput; responsetime; and failure-resilience requirements of a search engine requires massive storage and computationalresources and a careful system design for scalability. This is exemplified by the big datacenters of the leading commercial search engines. Various proposals and debates haveappeared in the literature as to whether Web indexes can be implemented in a fullydistributed or even peer-to-peer manner without impeding scalability; and differentpartitioning strategies have been worked out. In this paper; we resume this ongoingdiscussion by analyzing the design space for distributed Web indexing; considering theinfluence of partitioning strategies as well as different storage technologies including Flash-RAM. We outline and discuss the pros and cons of three fundamental alternatives; and …,Proceedings of the 1st LSDS-IR Workshop,2007,7
Tracking set correlations at large scale,Foteini Alvanaki; Sebastian Michel,Abstract In this work; we consider the continuous computation of correlations between co-occurring tags that appear in messages published in social media streams. The vast amountand pace these messages are created makes it necessary to parallelise the computation ofcorrelations to various nodes in a computing cluster. The main challenge in this is to ensurethat each node will compute a subset of the coefficients and every coefficient will becomputed by some node. The core task is to continuously create and maintain partitions ofthe tags and forward the incoming messages based on them. Our approach proposes andevaluates several algorithms that partition the tags to the nodes while at the same time theyminimise the replication of tags to the nodes and balance the load on them. The proposedframework is implemented in Java within the Storm stream processing platform. We …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2014,6
Efficient monitoring of personalized hot news over Web 2.0 streams,Parisa Haghani; Sebastian Michel; Karl Aberer,Abstract Web 2.0 streams; like blog postings; micro-blogging tweets; or RSS feeds fromonline communities; offer a wealth of latest news about real-world events and societaldiscussion. From a user's perspective; it becomes harder and harder to get a decentoverview of recent events; given these massive streams of information that are continuouslyflowing. Ideally; a system would continuously put together recent information; ranked by thecurrent social impact but also weighted by the users' personal interests. In this work; wedevelop methods to meet these requirements. The presented approach continuously tracksthe most popular tags attached to the incoming items and based on this; constructs adynamic top-k query. By continuous evaluation of this query on the incoming stream; we areable to retrieve the currently hottest items. These hottest items are then fed into an engine …,Computer Science-Research and Development,2012,6
Optimizing distributed top-k queries,Thomas Neumann; Matthias Bender; Sebastian Michel; Ralf Schenkel; Peter Triantafillou; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract Top-k query processing is a fundamental building block for efficient ranking in alarge number of applications. Efficiency is a central issue; especially for distributed settings;when the data is spread across different nodes in a network. This paper introduces noveloptimization methods for top-k aggregation queries in such distributed environments thatcan be applied to all algorithms that fall into the frameworks of the prior TPUT and KLEEmethods. The optimizations address 1) hierarchically grouping input lists into top-k operatortrees and optimizing the tree structure; and 2) computing data-adaptive scan depths fordifferent input sources. The paper presents comprehensive experiments with two differentreal-life datasets; using the ns-2 network simulator for a packet-level simulation of a largeInternet-style network.,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2008,6
Algebraic query optimization for distributed top-k queries,Thomas Neumann; Sebastian Michel,Abstract Distributed top-k query processing is increasingly becoming an essentialfunctionality in a large number of emerging application classes. This paper addresses theefficient algebraic optimization of top-k queries in wide-area distributed data repositorieswhere the index lists for the attribute values (or text terms) of a query are distributed across anumber of data peers and the computational costs include network latency; bandwidthconsumption; and local peer work. We use a dynamic programming approach to find theoptimal execution plan using compact data synopses for selectivity estimation that is thebasis for our cost model. The optimized query is executed in a hierarchical way involving asmall and fixed number of communication phases. We have performed experiments on realweb data that show the benefits of distributed top-k query optimization both in network …,Informatik-Forschung und Entwicklung,2007,6
P2p directories for distributed web search: From each according to his ability; to each according to his needs,Matthias Bender; Sebastian Michel; Gerhard Weikum,A compelling application of peer-to-peer (P2P) system technology would be distributed Websearch; where each peer autonomously runs a search engine on a personalized localcorpus (eg; built from a thematically focused Web crawl) and peers collaborate by routingqueries to remote peers that can contribute many or particularly good results for thesespecific queries. Such systems typically rely on a decentralized directory; eg; built on top of adistributed hash table (DHT); that holds compact; aggregated statistical metadata about thepeers which is used to identify promising peers for a particular query. To support an a-prioriunlimited number of peers; it is crucial to keep the load on the distributed directory low.Moreover; each peer should ideally tailor its postings to the directory to reflect its particularstrengths; such as rich information about specialized topics that no or only few other …,Data Engineering Workshops; 2006.

Reverse Engineering Top-k Database Queries with PALEO.,Kiril Panev; Sebastian Michel,ABSTRACT Ranked lists are an essential methodology to succinctly summarize outstandingitems; computed over database tables or crowdsourced in dedicated websites. In this work;we address the problem of reverse engineering top-k queries over a database; that is; givena relation R and a sample topk result list; our approach; named PALEO1; aims atdetermining an SQL query that returns the provided input result when executed over R. Thecore problem consists of finding predicates of the where clause that return the given items;determining the correct ranking criteria; and to evaluate the most promising candidatequeries first. To capture cases where only a sample of R is available or when R is different tothe relation that indeed generated the input; we put forward a probabilistic model that allowsassessing the chance of a query to output tuples that are resembling or are somewhat …,EDBT,2016,5
Top-k interesting phrase mining in ad-hoc collections using sequence pattern indexing,Chuancong Gao; Sebastian Michel,Abstract In this paper we consider the problem of mining frequently occurring interestingphrases in large document collections in an ad-hoc fashion. Ad-hoc refers to the ability toperform such analyses over text corpora that can be an arbitrary subset of a global set ofdocuments. Most of the times the identification of these ad-hoc document collections isdriven by a user or application defined query with the aim of gathering statistics describingthe sub-collection; as a starting point for further data analysis tasks. Our approach to minethe top-k most interesting phrases consists of a novel indexing technique; called SequencePattern Indexing (SeqPattIndex); that benefits from the observation that phrases oftenoverlap sequentially. We devise a forest based index for phrases and an further improvedversion with additional redundancy elimination power. The actual top-k phrase mining …,Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2012,5

Challenges of distributed search across digital libraries,Matthias Bender; Sebastian Michel; Gerhard Weikum; Christian Zimmer,Abstract. We present the MINERVA1 project that tackles the problem of collaborative searchacross a large number of digital libraries. The search engine is layered on top of a Chord-style peer-to-peer overlay network that connects an a-priori unlimited number of peers ordigital libraries. Each library posts a small amount of metadata to a conceptually global; butphysically distributed directory. This directory is used to efficiently select promising librariesto execute a query based on their local data. The paper discusses current challengesregarding replication; caching and proactive dissemination; query routing based on localuser profiles such as bookmarks; and benefit/cost models for query routing.,Future Digital Library Management Systems: System Architecture and Information Access,2005,5
The Sweet Spot between Inverted Indices and Metric-Space Indexing for Top-K-List Similarity Search.,Evica Milchevski; Avishek Anand; Sebastian Michel,ABSTRACT We consider the problem of processing similarity queries over a set of top-krankings where the query ranking and the similarity threshold are provided at query time.Spearman's Footrule distance is used to compute the similarity between rankings;considering how well rankings agree on the positions (ranks) of ranked items (ie; the L1distance). This setup allows the application of metric index structures such as M-or BK-treesand; alternatively; enables the use of traditional inverted indices for retrieving rankings thatoverlap (in items) with the query. Although both techniques are reasonable; they come withindividual drawbacks for our specific problem. In this paper; we propose a hybrid indexingstrategy; which blends inverted indices and metric space indexing; resulting in a structurethat resembles both indexing methods with tunable emphasis on one or the other.

Interesting event detection through hall of fame rankings,Foteini Alvanaki; Evica Ilieva; Sebastian Michel; Aleksandar Stupar,Abstract Everything is relative. Cars are compared by gas per mile; websites by page rank;students based on GPA; scientists by number of publications; and celebrities by beauty orwealth. In this paper; we study the characteristics of such entity rankings based on a set ofrankings obtained from a popular Web portal. The obtained insights are integrated in ourapproach; coined Pantheon. Pantheon maintains sets of top-k rankings and reportsidentified changes in a way that appeals to users; using a novel combination of differentcharacteristics like competitiveness; information entropy; and scale of change.

Processing publish/subscribe queries over distributed data streams,Oana Jurca; Sebastian Michel; Alexandre Herrmann; Karl Aberer,Abstract We address the problem of processing continuous multi-join queries; overdistributed data streams; making use of existing work in the field of publish/subscribesystems. We show how these principles can be ported to data streams; by enriching thecommon query model with location dependent attributes. Users can subscribe to a set ofsensor attributes; a service that requires processing multi-join correlation queries. The goalis to decrease the overall network traffic consumption by removing redundant subscriptionsand eliminating unrequested events close to the publishing sensors. This is non-trivial;especially in the presence of multi-join queries without any central control mechanism. Ourapproach is based on the concept of filter-split-forward phases for efficient subscriptionfiltering and placement inside the network.

Query driven operator placement for complex event detection over data streams,Oana Jurca; Sebastian Michel; Alexandre Herrmann; Karl Aberer,Abstract. We consider the problem of efficiently processing subscrip-tion queries over datastreams in large-scale interconnected sensor networks. We propose a scalable algorithm fordistributed data stream processing; applicable on top of any platform granting access tointercon-nected sensor networks. We make use of a probabilistic algorithm to check whethersubscriptions are subsumed by other subscriptions and thus can be pruned for more efficientprocessing. Our proposed methods are query driven; hence do not replicate data streams;but intelligently place join operators inside the global network of sources. We show by aperformance evaluation using real world sensor data the suitability of our approach.,Smart Sensing and Context: Third European Conference; EuroSSC 2008; Zurich; Switzerland; October 29-31; 2008: Adjunct Proceedings,2008,4
Being picky: processing top-k queries with set-defined selections,Aleksandar Stupar; Sebastian Michel,Abstract Focusing on the top-K items according to a ranking criterion constitutes animportant functionality in many different query answering scenarios. The idea is to read onlythe necessary information---mostly from secondary storage---with the ultimate goal toachieve low latency. In this work; we consider processing such top-K queries under theconstraint that the result items are members of a specific set; which is provided at query time.We call this restriction a set-defined selection criterion. Set-defined selections drasticallyinfluence the pros and cons of an id-ordered index vs. a score-ordered index. We present amathematical model that allows to decide at runtime which index to choose; leading to acombined index. To improve the latency around the break even point of the two indices; weshow how to benefit from a partitioned score-ordered index and present an algorithm to …,Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2012,3
Smooth interpolating histograms with error guarantees,Thomas Neumann; Sebastian Michel,Abstract Accurate selectivity estimations are essential for query optimization decisionswhere they are typically derived from various kinds of histograms which condense valuedistributions into compact representations. The estimation accuracy of existing approachestypically varies across the domain; with some estimations being very accurate and somequite inaccurate. This is in particular unfortunate when performing a parametric search usingthese estimations; as the estimation artifacts can dominate the search results. We proposethe usage of linear splines to construct histograms with known error guarantees across thewhole continuous domain. These histograms are particularly well suited for using theestimates in parameter optimization.

P2P authority analysis for social communities,Josiane Xavier Parreira; Sebastian Michel; Matthias Bender; Tom Crecelius; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract PageRank-style authority analyses of Web graphs are of great importance for Webmining. Such authority analyses also apply to hot" Web 2.0" applications that exhibit anatural graph structure; such as social networks (eg; MySpace; Facebook) or taggingcommunities (eg; Flickr; Del. icio. us). Finding the most trustworthy or most importantauthorities in such a community is a pressing need; given the huge scale and also theanonymity of social networks. Computing global authority measures in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P)collaboration of autonomous peers is a hot research topic; in particular because of theincomplete local knowledge of the peers; which typically only know about (arbitrarilyoverlapping) sub-graphs of the complete graph.

Efficient Similarity Search across Top-k Lists under the Kendall's Tau Distance,Koninika Pal; Sebastian Michel,Abstract We consider the problem of similarity search in a set of top-k lists under thegeneralized Kendall's Tau distance. This distance describes how related two rankings are interms of discordantly ordered items. We consider pair-and triplets-based indices to counterthe shortcomings of naive inverted indices and derive efficient query schemes by relating theproposed index structures to the concept of locality sensitive hashing (LSH). Specifically; wedevise four different LSH schemes for Kendall's Tau using two generic hash families overindividual elements or pairs of them. We show that each of these functions has the desiredproperty of being locality sensitive. Further; we discuss the selection of hash functions for theproposed LSH schemes for a given query ranking; called query-driven LSH and derivebounds for the required number of hash functions to use in order to achieve a predefined …,Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management,2016,2
Computing similar entity rankings via reverse engineering of top-k database queries,Kiril Panev; Evica Milchevski; Sebastian Michel,Ranked lists are an essential methodology to succinctly summarize outstanding items;computed over database tables or crowdsourced in dedicated websites. Previous work hasalready addressed the problem of reverse engineering top-k queries over a database.However; existing systems fail to return any answer to the user when a precisely matchingquery has not been found. In this work; we tackle this problem of determining queries thatcompute lists similar to a user-specified input ranking. More precisely; for a ranked list ofentities L and a similarity threshold θ; we want to find queries that return lists Lr with d (L;Lr)≤ θ; where d (L; Lr) is the distance between the lists. Through a detailed experimentalstudy we show that our system is able to achieve; in most of the cases; a Recall@ 10 higherthan 80%.,Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW); 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on,2016,2
Playing LEGO with JSON: Probabilistic joins over attribute-value fragments,Manuel Hoffmann; Evica Milchevski; Sebastian Michel,Information about an entity can hardly be assumed to be given in one single document;created in a single instance of time. Rather; it is reasonable to assume that information isspread over multiple documents and created/enriched over time-for instance throughcrowdsourcing facts or mined from social network streams; one after the other. In this work;we consider the problem of assembling entity-centric information out of input comprisingsmall pieces of information; provided in form of JSON document snippets. The final goal is tocreate a document that (possibly fully) describes an entity by putting related fragmentstogether. What makes this task challenging is the lack of evidence telling which fragmentsbelong together and; hence; can be safely combined. We focus on deciding this questionusing statistics of the already seen fragments; to justify if a join is reasonable or not.

A Data Mining Approach to Choosing Categorical Attributes for Ranked Lists.,Koninika Pal; Sebastian Michel,ABSTRACT This work proposes and evaluates a novel approach to determine interestingcategory for ranked lists using ν-SVM.

ligDB-Online Query Processing Without (almost) any Storage.,Evica Milchevski; Sebastian Michel,ABSTRACT In the big-data era data is arriving at such a high pace and volume that dataexploration and querying can only be feasible if data loading and indexing happensreasonably quick—if at all. Recent research on handling large scientific data suggestsignoring any database indexing or even data-loading processing steps but rather turnstoward processing raw data as it is handed in by scientists; manually or by semi-automatedmeans—if needed in multiple; iterative steps. In this paper; we describe the anatomy andresearch challenges of a system coined ligDB1 that is operating purely on incompletedatabase tables; JSON documents; or sets of SPO triplets that are being filled over time.There is no data stored per se; the only data stored is stemming from previously posedqueries over the stream of arriving data; kept as long as it is used by forthcoming queries …,EDBT,2015,2
An LSH index for computing kendall's tau over top-k lists,Koninika Pal; Sebastian Michel,Abstract: We consider the problem of similarity search within a set of top-k lists under theKendall's Tau distance function. This distance describes how related two rankings are interms of concordantly and discordantly ordered items. As top-k lists are usually very shortcompared to the global domain of possible items to be ranked; creating an inverted index tolook up overlapping lists is possible but does not capture tight enough the similaritymeasure. In this work; we investigate locality sensitive hashing schemes for the Kendall'sTau distance and evaluate the proposed methods using two real-world datasets.,arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.0651,2014,2
Scalable; continuous tracking of tag co-occurrences between short sets using (almost) disjoint tag partitions,Foteini Alvanaki; Sebastian Michel,Abstract In this work we consider the continuous computation of set correlations over astream of set-valued attributes; such as Tweets and their hashtags; social annotations ofblog posts obtained through RSS; or updates to set-valued attributes of databases. In orderto compute tag correlations in a distributed fashion; all necessary information has to bepresent at the computing node (s). Our approach makes use of a partitioning scheme basedon set covers for efficient and replication-lean information flow. We report on the results of apreliminary performance evaluation using Tweets obtained through Twitter's streaming API.,Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD Workshop on Databases and Social Networks,2013,2
Building and maintaining halls of fame over a database,Foteini Alvanaki; Sebastian Michel; Aleksandar Stupar,Abstract: Halls of Fame are fascinating constructs. They represent the elite of an often verylarge amount of entities---persons; companies; products; countries etc. Beyond theirpractical use as static rankings; changes to them are particularly interesting---for decisionmaking processes; as input to common media or novel narrative science applications; orsimply consumed by users. In this work; we aim at detecting events that can becharacterized by changes to a Hall of Fame ranking in an automated way. We describe howthe schema and data of a database can be used to generate Halls of Fame. In this databasescenario; by Hall of Fame we refer to distinguished tuples; entities; whose characteristics setthem apart from the majority. We define every Hall of Fame as one specific instance of anSQL query; such that a change in its result is considered a noteworthy event. Identified …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1208.1231,2012,2
Enhancing Locality Sensitive Hashing with Peek Probing and Nearest Neighbor Links.,Aleksandar Stupar; Sebastian Michel,ABSTRACT In this work; we consider search in high dimensional data and propose twooptimization techniques for Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). LSH has been successfullyapplied to search in multi-media databases or to duplicate detection in large Web or XMLcollections. LSH maps objects from a high-dimensional feature space to a set of buckets;using a hash function likely to cause hash collisions for similar objects. The firstenhancement of LSH is based on additionally introduced links for each point in the featurespace. These links refer to the exact nearest neighbor. The second approach is coined Peek-Probing; where LSH buckets are only fully read if they indicate a certain amount of usefulinformation. The techniques are fully orthogonal and; hence; can be used in a combinedway for further improved performance. We study the suitability of our approaches based …,WebDB,2012,2
Tracking hot-k items over Web 2.0 streams,Parisa Haghani; Sebastian Michel; Karl Aberer,Abstract: The rise of the Web 2.0 has made content publishing easier than ever. Yesterday'spassive consumers are now active users who generate and contribute new data to the webat an immense rate. We consider evaluating data driven aggregation queries which arise inWeb 2.0 applications. In this context; each user action is interpreted as an event in acorresponding stream eg; a particular weblog feed; or a photo stream. The presentedapproach continuously tracks the most popular tags attached to the incoming items andbased on this; constructs a dynamic top-k query. By continuous evaluation of this query onthe incoming stream; we are able to retrieve the currently hottest items. To limit the queryprocessing cost; we propose to pre-aggregate index lists for parts of the query which arelater on used to construct the full query result. As it is prohibitively expensive to …,Proceedings of the 14. GI-Fachtagung Datenbanksysteme für Business; Technologie und Web (BTW 2011),2011,2
Knowing when to slide-efficient scheduling for sliding window processing,Ali Salehi; Mehdi Riahi; Sebastian Michel; Karl Aberer,We consider sliding window query execution scheduling in stream processing engines.Sliding windows are an essential building block to limit the query focus at a particular part ofthe stream; based either on value count or time ranges. These so called sliding windowpredicates specify the execution condition for the query. Due to the often massive amount ofregistered queries; efficient algorithms to check these predicates are essential. While thereexists a comprehensive set of works on the stream processing techniques; the actualalgorithms to intelligently decide on the sliding behaviors is not extensively addressed in theexisting works. In this paper we propose a set of algorithms for managing and sharingsliding decisions. This work introduces the concept of the batch sliding and sliding graphs toimprove the sliding decision of the stream processing engines.

Search for the Best but Expect the Worst-Distributed Top-k Queries over Decreasing Aggregated Scores.,Sebastian Michel; Thomas Neumann,ABSTRACT We consider distributed top-k queries in wide-area networks where the indexlists for the attribute values (or text terms) of a query are distributed across a number of datapeers. In contrast to existing work; we exclusively consider distributed top-k queries overdecreasing aggregated values. State-of-the-art distributed top-k algorithms usually dependon threshold propagation to reduce expensive data access across the network; but fail tocompute tight thresholds if the aggregation function is decreasing. Decreasing aggregationfunctions; however; occur naturally; for example when considering conjunctive queries. Ourproposed algorithms allow for efficient execution of these kind of queries; using acombination of threshold propagation and semijoin techniques. We demonstrate thesetechniques for the problem of top-k peer selection in a Peer-To-Peer Web search engine …,WebDB,2007,2

Learning Interesting Categorical Attributes for Refined Data Exploration,Koninika Pal; Sebastian Michel,Abstract: This work proposes and evaluates a novel approach to determine interestingcategorical attributes for lists of entities. Once identified; such categories are of immensevalue to allow constraining (filtering) a current view of a user to subsets of entities. We showhow a classifier is trained that is able to tell whether or not a categorical attribute can act as aconstraint; in the sense of human-perceived interestingness. The training data is harnessedfrom Web tables; treating the presence or absence of a table as an indication that theattribute used as a filter constraint is reasonable or not.

Exploring databases via reverse engineering ranking queries with PALEO,Kiril Panev; Sebastian Michel; Evica Milchevski; Koninika Pal,Abstract A novel approach to explore databases using ranked lists is demonstrated. Workingwith ranked lists; capturing the relative performance of entities; is a very intuitive and widelyapplicable concept. Users can post lists of entities for which explanatory SQL queries andfull result lists are returned. By refining the input; the results; or the queries; user caninteractively explore the database content. The demonstrated system is centered around ourPALEO framework for reverse engineering OLAP-style database queries and novel work onmining interesting categorical attributes.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,1

A thin monitoring layer for top-k aggregation queries over a database,Foteini Alvanaki; Sebastian Michel,Abstract We consider the problem of maintaining a large set of top-k rankings over theupdate stream of a database. The rankings stem from top-k aggregation queries that aregiven a-priori based on the application scenario; for instance created along dimensions of atraditional data warehouse; for efficient automated reporting/detection of changes. The focuson only the top part of a ranking enables efficient buffering techniques to limit expensiveinteractions with the underlying database; while still guaranteeing correct top-k rankings atall times. This is achieved by employing conservative rank (score) estimates of previouslyunseen items that are not in the top-k result so far. The proposed family of maintenancealgorithms further exploits the relations between the monitored rankings known from multi-query optimisation. We present results of a preliminary experimental evaluation using …,Proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on Ranking in Databases,2013,1

Efficiently handling dynamics in distributed link based authority analysis,Josiane Xavier Parreira; Sebastian Michel; Gerhard Weikum,Abstract Link based authority analysis is an important tool for ranking resources in socialnetworks and other graphs. Previous work have presented J^X_P; a decentralized algorithmfor computing PageRank scores. The algorithm is designed to work in distributed systems;such as peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. However; the dynamics of the P2P networks; one if itsmain characteristics; is currently not handled by the algorithm. This paper shows how toadapt J^X_P to work under network churn. First; we present a distributed algorithm thatestimates the number of distinct documents in the network; which is needed in the localcomputation of the PageRank scores. We then present a method that enables each peer todetect other peers leave and to update its view of the network. We show that the number ofstored items in the network can be efficiently estimated; with little overhead on the …,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2008,1
Size doesn't always matter: exploiting pageRank for query routing in distributed IR,Josiane Xavier Parreira; Sebastian Michel; Matthias Bender,Abstract PageRank authority scores have proven to be a powerful ingredient to localdocument scoring. Since query routing; ie; carefully selecting a small subset of promisingpeers for a particular query from a large network; bears a close resemblance to localdocument scoring; it suggests itself that authority scores could also be beneficial for queryrouting; which is one of the biggest challenges in P2P Web search. For that purpose; weshowcase JXP; an authority score measure that converges to true global PageRank scoresin a distributed environment. Subsequently; we present several possible strategies toincorporate authority scores into query routing; including a hybrid strategy that combinesauthority scores with other existing measures. Preliminary experimental results support ourhypothesis that authority scores can be highly beneficial to query routing.,Proceedings of the international workshop on Information retrieval in peer-to-peer networks,2006,1

A comparative study of pub/sub methods in structured p2p networks,Sebastian Parkitny; Gerhard Weikum; Matthias Bender; Sebastian Michel; Thorsten Herfet,Abstract Publish/Subscribe systems have become an established model to provide contentdelivery from publishers to subscribers. Many approaches based on top of a P2P networkhave been proposed and evaluated; but typically each approach is evaluated on its own. Weidentify two approaches to implement Publish/Subscribe based on a structured P2P networkand provide a mathematical analysis of their complexity. Furthermore; we compare the twoapproaches for several choices of system parameters and associate the outcomes to certainusage scenarios. Thus; we can provide evidence of which of these approaches is suitablefor certain scenarios. Finally; we design and implement a discrete event simulator andpresent results of experimental measurements of both approaches. viii,Universität des Saarlandes; Tech. Rep,2006,1
Overlap-aware global df estimation in distributed information retrieval systems,Matthias Bender; Sebastian Michel; Gerhard Weikum; Peter Triantafilou,Zusammenfassung Peer-to-Peer (P2P) search engines and other forms of distributedinformation retrieval (IR) are gaining momentum. Unlike in centralized IR; it is difficult andexpensive to compute statistical measures about the entire document collection as it iswidely distributed across many computers in a highly dynamic network. On the other hand;such network-wide statistics; most notably; global document frequencies of the individualterms; would be highly beneficial for ranking global search results that are compiled fromdifferent peers. This paper develops an efficient and scalable method for estimating globaldocument frequencies in a large-scale; highly dynamic P2P network with autonomouspeers. The main difficulty that is addressed in this paper is that the local collections ofdifferent peers may arbitrarily overlap; as many peers may choose to gather popular …,*,2006,1

Class-Constraint Similarity Queries,Jessica A de Souza; Agma JM Traina; Sebastian Michel,ABSTRACT Similarity searching is a widely applied concept on multimedia or complex data;such as images; videos; time-series; among others. Therefore; it is important to look at theexecution of specific query types; eg; constrained k-nearest neighbor that is directly basedon bounded regions. In this paper; we present the Class-Constraint k-Nearest Neighbor(CCkNN) query; which goes beyond the traditional constrained k-nearest neighbor; becauseour CCkNN works for any specific categories of data points. The proposed CCkNN aims ataccelerating the process of class-constraint similarity query execution by taking advantageof performing queries on multiple metric access methods regarding the class dimensions ofthe objects of each index. Additionally; this strategy identifies which index is moreappropriate to run class-constraint on the k-nearest neighbor queries. Experimental …,*,2018,*

LSH-Based Probabilistic Pruning of Inverted Indices for Sets and Ranked Lists,Koninika Pal; Sebastian Michel,Abstract We address the problem of index pruning without compromising the quality of ad-hoc similarity search among sets and ranked lists. We discuss three different ways to prunethe index structure and; by linking the index structure with the concept of Locality SensitiveHashing (LSH); we introduce two solutions to query processing over the pruned index.Through a probabilistic analysis we ensure that a user-defined recall goal is still guaranteed.We are able to formulate an optimization problem that can determine the optimal pruningfactor for all three pruning methods. The experimental evaluations over real-world datavalidate that the optimal pruning factor indeed ensures the recall goal without any significanteffect on the quality of similarity search on a much smaller index.,Proceedings of the 20th International Workshop on the Web and Databases,2017,*

Quantifying Likelihood of Change through Update Propagation across Top-k Rankings.,Evica Milchevski; Sebastian Michel,ABSTRACT Rankings are a widely used techniques to condense a potentially large amountof information into a concise form. However; rankings are dynamic and undergo changes;thus need to be maintained; which can be a tedious and expensive task. Given a ranking τthat got updated to τ; we aim at identifying those rankings σ that are very likely to havechanged as well; as they are close in distance to the original ranking τ. We do so bymodeling the expected change in form of a hypothetical ranking σ and mark σ to require arefresh if the expected change is above a threshold. We do this for the Footrule distance anddemonstrate through a preliminary evaluation the potential of our approach.,EDBT,2016,*

Such an approach gives means for a genericway to formulate various information needs; much more powerful than simple keywordqueries. Particularly appealing is the ability to combine (join) information from differentsources and the ability to compute simple statistics that can be used to select promisinginformation pieces. What might sound like a hopeless effort due to the inherent complexityexpressible by SQL-style queries is at second glance not complicated to understand and touse. Already very simple combinations (ie; joins) of different data sources (ie; tables) offer asurprisingly large set of interesting use cases.

For a given query consisting of a set of terms; weefficiently compute a connected subset of users that jointly cover the query terms; based onthe annotation vocabulary utilized by users in the past. The presented approach is twofold;first we identify so-called seed users; centers of interest groups; that act as starting points ofthe group exploration. Subsequently; we inspect the seed users' neighborhoods and buildup the tree connecting the most promising neighbors. We demonstrate the applicability andefficiency of our method by conducting a series of experiments on data extracted from a Webportal showing that our method does not only provide accurate answers but calculates thesealso in an efficient way.,BTW,2011,*

The estimation accuracy of existingapproaches typically varies across the domain; with some estimations being very accurateand some quite inaccurate.

Bei allen aktiven Proteasen wird derinhibierend wirkende N-Terminus abgespalten und so lasst sich im Immunoblot mit …,Allergo Journal,2000,*

Authors’ Addresses Foteini Alvanaki Universität des Saarlandes Campus E 1 7 D-66123 Saarbrücken,Sebastian Michel,Abstract Halls of Fame are fascinating constructs. They represent the elite of an often verylarge amount of entities—persons; companies; products; countries etc. Beyond theirpractical use as static rankings; changes to them are particularly interesting—for decisionmaking processes; as input to common media or novel narrative science applications; orsimply consumed by users. In this work; we aim at detecting events that can becharacterized by changes to a Hall of Fame ranking in an automated way. We describe howthe schema and data of a database can be used to generate Halls of Fame. In this databasescenario; by Hall of Fame we refer to distinguished tuples; entities; whose characteristics setthem apart from the majority. We define every Hall of Fame as one specific instance of anSQL query; such that a change in its result is considered a noteworthy event. Identified …,*,*,*
Database Selection and Result Merging in P2P Web Search,Matthias Bender; Sergey Chernov; Sebastian Michel; Pavel Serdyukov; Gerhard Weikum; Christian Zimmer,Abstract. Intelligent Web search engines are extremely popular now. Currently; only thecommercial centralized search engines like Google can process terabytes of Web data.Alternative search engines fulfilling collaborative Web search on a voluntary basis areusually based on a blooming Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technology. In this paper; we investigatethe effectiveness of different database selection and result merging methods in the scope ofP2P Web search engine Minerva. We adapt existing measures for database selection andresults merging; all directly derived from popular document ranking measures; to addressthe specific issues of P2P Web search. We propose the general approach to both tasksbased on combination of pseudo-relevance feedback methods. From experiments withTREC Web data; we observe that the pseudo-relevance feedback information from the …,*,*,*
