The dimensional fact model: A conceptual model for data warehouses,Matteo Golfarelli; Dario Maio; Stefano Rizzi,Data warehousing systems enable enterprise managers to acquire and integrate informationfrom heterogeneous sources and to query very large databases efficiently. Building a datawarehouse requires adopting design and implementation techniques completely differentfrom those underlying operational information systems. Though most scientific literature onthe design of data warehouses concerns their logical and physical models; an accurateconceptual design is the necessary foundations for building a DW which is well-documentedand fully satisfies requirements. In this paper we formalize a graphical conceptual model fordata warehouses; called Dimensional Fact model; and propose a semi-automatedmethodology to build it from the pre-existing (conceptual or logical) schemes describing theenterprise relational database.

Conceptual design of data warehouses from E/R schemes,Matteo Golfarelli; Dario Maio; Stefano Rizzi,Data warehousing systems enable enterprise managers to acquire and integrate informationfrom heterogeneous sources and to query very large databases efficiently. Building a datawarehouse requires adopting design and implementation techniques completely differentfrom those underlying information systems. We present a graphical conceptual model fordata warehouses; called Dimensional Fact model; and propose a semi-automatedmethodology to build it from the pre-existing entity/relationship schemes describing adatabase.

Beyond data warehousing: what's next in business intelligence?,Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi; Iuris Cella,Abstract During the last ten years the approach to business management has deeplychanged; and companies have understood the importance of enforcing achievement of thegoals defined by their strategy through metrics-driven management. The DW process;though supporting bottom-up extraction of information from data; fails in top-down enforcingthe company strategy. A new approach to BI; called Business Performance Management(BPM); is emerging from this framework: it includes DW but it also requires a reactivecomponent capable of monitoring the time-critical operational processes to allow tacticaland operational decision-makers to tune their actions according to the company strategy.The aim of this paper is to encourage the research community to acknowledge the coming ofa second era in BI; to propose a general architecture for BPM; and to lay the premises for …,Proceedings of the 7th ACM international workshop on Data warehousing and OLAP,2004,428

A methodological framework for data warehouse design,Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi,ABSTRACT Though designing a data warehouse requires techniques completely differentfrom those adopted for operational systems; no significant effort has been made so far todevelop a complete and consistent design methodology for data warehouses. In this paperwe outline a general methodological framework for data warehouse design; based on ourDimensional Fact Model (DFM). After analyzing the existing information system andcollecting the user requirements; conceptual design is carried out semi-automaticallystarting from the operational database scheme. A workload is then characterized in terms ofdata volumes and expected queries; to be used as the input of the logical and physicaldesign phases whose output is the final scheme for the data warehouse.,Proceedings of the 1st ACM international workshop on Data warehousing and OLAP,1998,296
On the error-reject trade-off in biometric verification systems,Matteo Golfarelli; Dario Maio; D Malton,We address the problem of performance evaluation in biometric verification systems. Byformulating the optimum Bayesian decision criterion for a verification system and byassuming the data distributions to be multinormals; we derive two statistical expressions forcalculating theoretically the false acceptance and false rejection rates. Generally; theadoption of a Bayesian parametric model does not allow for obtaining explicit expressionsfor the calculation of the system errors. As far as biometric verification systems areconcerned; some hypotheses can be reasonably adopted; thus allowing simple andaffordable expressions to be derived. By using two verification system prototypes. Based onhand shape and human face; respectively; we show our results are well founded.,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,1997,252
Data warehouse design from XML sources,Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi; Boris Vrdoljak,Abstract A large amount of data needed in decision-making processes is stored in the XMLdata format; which is widely used for e-commerce and Internet-based information exchange.Thus; as more organizations view the web as an integral part of their communication andbusiness; the importance of integrating XML data in data warehousing environments isbecoming increasingly high. In this paper we show how the design of a data mart can becarried out starting directly from an XML source. Two main issues arise: on the one hand;since XML models semi-structured data; not all the information needed for design can besafely derived; on the other; different approaches for representing relationships in XMLDTDs and Schemas are possible; each with different expressive power. After discussingthese issues; we propose a semi-automatic approach for building the conceptual schema …,Proceedings of the 4th ACM international workshop on Data warehousing and OLAP,2001,158

From User Requirements to Conceptual Design in Data Warehouse Design,Matteo Golfarelli,ABSTRACT Conceptual design and requirement analysis are two of the key steps within thedata warehouse design process. They are to a great extent responsible for the success of adata warehouse project since; during these two phases; the expressivity of themultidimensional schemata is completely defined. This chapter proposes a survey of theliterature related to these design steps and points out pros and cons of the differenttechniques in order to help the reader to identify crucial choices and possible solutions moreconsciously. Particular attention will be devoted to emphasizing the relationships betweenthe two steps describing how they can be jointly used fruitfully.,IGI Global,2010,69
Elastic correction of dead-reckoning errors in map building,Matteo Golfarelli; Dario Maio; Stefano Rizzi,A major problem in map building is due to the imprecision of sensor measures. In this paperwe propose a technique; called elastic correction; for correcting the dead-reckoning errorsmade during the exploration of an unknown environment by a robot capable of identifyinglandmarks. Knowledge of the environment being acquired is modelled by a relational graphwhose vertices and arcs represent; respectively; landmarks and inter-landmark routes.Elastic correction is based on an analogy between this graph and a mechanical structure:the map is regarded as a truss where each route is an elastic bar and each landmark anode. Errors are corrected as a result of the deformations induced from the forces arisingwithin the structure as inconsistent measures are taken. The uncertainty on odometry ismodelled by the elasticity parameters characterizing the structure.,Intelligent Robots and Systems; 1998. Proceedings.; 1998 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on,1998,69

Index selection techniques in data warehouse systems,M Golfarelli; S Rizzi; E Saltarelli,Abstract In the area of decision support systems; a basic role is held by data warehouses.Though designing a data warehouse requires different techniques from those experiencedin operational databases; it is still possible to decompose the design process into threedistinct phases: conceptual design; logical design and physical design. This paperaddresses a basic issue in physical design by proposing a heuristic approach which selectsan optimal index set to be built in a data warehouse implemented on a relational DBMS. Toachieve this goal we simulate an optimizer which generates query execution plans anddefine a cost model to evaluate them.

Multi-agent path planning based on task-swap negotiation,Matteo Golfarelli; Dario Maio; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract Symbolic path planning in autonomous robotic agents is the search; on a network ofplaces and routes modeling the environment; for a sequence of routes which enables anagent to execute a set of inter-related tasks. When several agents are present in theenvironment; each having been assigned a set of tasks; the adoption of coordinationmechanisms allows the task-execution costs to be decreased. The formulation of tasksincludes resources; resource types; temporal and precedence constraints; production anduse of objects. In this paper we propose a market-like negotiation protocol which extends thewell-known Contract Net Protocol to domains where task swap is the only possible type ofcontract. After planning an initial path to execute its tasks; each agent uses this protocol toprogressively decrease the path cost by swapping tasks with other agents.

Similarity measures for OLAP sessions,Julien Aligon; Matteo Golfarelli; Patrick Marcel; Stefano Rizzi; Elisa Turricchia,Abstract OLAP queries are not normally formulated in isolation; but in the form of sequencescalled OLAP sessions. Recognizing that two OLAP sessions are similar would be useful fordifferent applications; such as query recommendation and personalization; however; theproblem of measuring OLAP session similarity has not been studied so far. In this paper; weaim at filling this gap. First; we propose a set of similarity criteria derived from a user studyconducted with a set of OLAP practitioners and researchers. Then; we propose a function forestimating the similarity between OLAP queries based on three components: the querygroup-by set; its selection predicate; and the measures required in output. To assess thesimilarity of OLAP sessions; we investigate the feasibility of extending four popular methodsfor measuring similarity; namely the Levenshtein distance; the Dice coefficient; the tf–idf …,Knowledge and information systems,2014,43
Mining preferences from OLAP query logs for proactive personalization,Julien Aligon; Matteo Golfarelli; Patrick Marcel; Stefano Rizzi; Elisa Turricchia,Abstract The goal of personalization is to deliver information that is relevant to an individualor a group of individuals in the most appropriate format and layout. In the OLAP contextpersonalization is quite beneficial; because queries can be very complex and they mayreturn huge amounts of data. Aimed at making the user's experience with OLAP as plain aspossible; in this paper we propose a proactive approach that couples an MDX-basedlanguage for expressing OLAP preferences to a mining technique for automatically derivingpreferences. First; the log of past MDX queries issued by that user is mined to extract a set ofassociation rules that relate sets of frequent query fragments; then; given a specific query; asubset of pertinent and effective rules is selected; finally; the selected rules are translatedinto a preference that is used to annotate the user's query.

Materialization of fragmented views in multidimensional databases,Matteo Golfarelli; Vittorio Maniezzo; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract The most effective technique to enhance performances of multidimensionaldatabases consists in materializing redundant aggregates called views. In the classicalapproach to materialization; each view includes all and only the measures of the cube itaggregates. In this paper we investigate the benefits of materializing views in verticalfragments; aimed at minimizing the workload response time. We formalize the fragmentationproblem as a 0–1 integer linear programming problem; which is then solved by means of astandard integer programming solver to determine the optimal fragmentation for a givenworkload. Finally; we demonstrate the usefulness of fragmentation by presenting a large setof experimental results based on the TPC-H benchmark.,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2004,42
OLAP query reformulation in peer-to-peer data warehousing,Matteo Golfarelli; Federica Mandreoli; Wilma Penzo; Stefano Rizzi; Elisa Turricchia,Abstract Inter-business collaborative contexts prefigure a distributed scenario wherecompanies organize and coordinate themselves to develop common and sharedopportunities; but traditional business intelligence systems do not provide support to thisend. To fill this gap; in this paper we envision a peer-to-peer data warehousing architecturebased on a network of heterogeneous peers; each exposing query answering functionalitiesaimed at sharing business information. To enhance the decision making process; an OLAPquery expressed on a peer needs to be properly reformulated on the local multidimensionalschemata of the other peers. To this end; we present a language for the definition ofmappings between the multidimensional schemata of peers and we introduce a queryreformulation framework that relies on the translation of mappings; queries; and …,Information Systems,2012,40

Mostapproaches in the literature only focus on the aggregation patterns required by the queriesin the workload; in this paper we propose an original approach to materialization in whichthe workload is characterized by the presence of complex queries which cannot beeffectively described only by their aggregation pattern. In particular; we consider queriesrepresented by nested GPSJ (Generalized Projection/Selection/Join) expressions; in whichsequences of aggregate operators may be applied to measures and selection predicatesmay be formulated; at different granularities; on both dimensions and measures.

This suggests thatsome further investigation on the methodological issues related to data warehouse design isnecessary; aimed at improving the development process from different points of view. In thispaper we analyze the potential advantages arising from the application of modern softwareengineering methodologies to a data warehouse project and we propose 4WD; a designmethodology that couples the main principles emerging from these methodologies to thepeculiarities of data warehouse projects. The principles underlying 4WD are risk-basediteration; evolutionary and incremental prototyping; user involvement; component reuse;formal and light documentation; and automated schema transformation.,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2011,29

What-if simulation modeling in business intelligence,Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract Optimizing decisions has become a vital factor for companies. In order to be able toevaluate beforehand the impact of a decision; managers need reliable provisional systems.Though data warehouses enable analysis of past data; they are not capable of givinganticipations of future trends. What-if analysis fills this gap by enabling users to simulate andinspect the behavior of a complex system under some given hypotheses. A crucial issue inthe design of what-if applications is to find an adequate formalism to conceptually expressthe underlying simulation model. In this paper the authors report on how; within theframework of a comprehensive design methodology; this can be accomplished by extendingUML 2 with a set of stereotypes.

Applying vertical fragmentation techniques in logical design of multidimensional databases,Matteo Golfarelli; Dario Maio; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract In the context of multidimensional databases implemented on relational DBMSsthrough star schemes; the most effective technique to enhance performances consists ofmaterializing redundant aggregates called views. In this paper we investigate the problem ofvertical fragmentation of views aimed at minimizing the workload response time. Each viewincludes several measures which not necessarily are always requested together; thus; thesystem performance may be increased by partitioning the views into smaller tables. On theother hand; drill-across queries involve measures taken from two or more views; in this casethe access costs may be decreased by unifying these views into larger tables. Afterformalizing the fragmentation problem as a 0–1 integer linear programming problem; wedefine a cost function and outline a branch-and-bound algorithm to minimize it.

Advanced topic modeling for social business intelligence,Enrico Gallinucci; Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract Social business intelligence combines corporate data with user-generated content(UGC) to make decision-makers aware of the trends perceived from the environment. A keyrole in the analysis of textual UGC is played by topics; meant as specific concepts of interestwithin a subject area. To enable aggregations of topics at different levels; a topic hierarchyhas to be defined. Some attempts have been made to address the peculiarities of topichierarchies; but no comprehensive solution has been found so far. The approach wepropose to model topic hierarchies in ROLAP systems is called meta-stars.

A collaborative filtering approach for recommending OLAP sessions,Julien Aligon; Enrico Gallinucci; Matteo Golfarelli; Patrick Marcel; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract While OLAP has a key role in supporting effective exploration of multidimensionalcubes; the huge number of aggregations and selections that can be operated on data maymake the user experience disorientating. To address this issue; in the paper we propose arecommendation approach stemming from collaborative filtering. We claim that the wholesequence of queries belonging to an OLAP session is valuable because it gives the user acompound and synergic view of data; for this reason; our goal is not to recommend singleOLAP queries but OLAP sessions. Like other collaborative approaches; ours features threephases:(i) search the log for sessions that bear some similarity with the one currently beingissued by the user;(ii) extract the most relevant subsessions; and (iii) adapt the top-rankedsubsession to the current user's session. However; it is the first that treats sessions as first …,Decision Support Systems,2015,23

A crucial issue in the design of what-if applications in the context ofbusiness intelligence is to find an adequate formalism to conceptually express theunderlying simulation model. In this experience paper we report on how this can beaccomplished by extending UML 2 with a set of stereotypes. Our proposal is centered on theuse of activity diagrams enriched with object flows; aimed at expressing functional; dynamic;and static aspects in an integrated fashion. The paper is completed by examples taken froma real case study in the commercial area.,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2008,19
Spatio-temporal clustering of tasks for swap-based negotiation protocols in multi-agent systems,Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract. Path planning in robotic agents consists in determining; on a network of places androutes modeling the environment; a sequence of resources to be visited in order to carry outa set of tasks. In multi-agent systems; agents may cooperate to decrease the task executioncosts; the Contract Net Protocol is an approach to negotiation of tasks based on theannouncement-bid-award mechanism. If the agents do not own money; they can decreasetheir costs only by swapping tasks with other agents; unfortunately; swapping only singletasks may trap negotiation in local minima of the cost. In this paper we show how the utility ofnegotiations can be increased by allowing tasks to be swapped in non-disjoint clusters.Clustering of tasks is carried out; in a fuzzy fashion; according to two orthogonal dimensionswhich consider; respectively; the spatial disposition of the resources within the …,Proceedings 6th International Conference on Intelligent Autonomous Systems,2000,19
What Time is it in the Data Warehouse?,Stefano Rizzi; Matteo Golfarelli,Abstract Though in most data warehousing applications no relevance is given to the timewhen events are recorded; some domains call for a different behavior. In particular;whenever late registrations of events take place; and particularly when the events registeredare subject to further updates; the traditional design solutions fail in preservingaccountability and query consistency. In this paper we discuss the alternative designsolutions that can be adopted; in presence of late registrations; to support different types ofqueries that enable meaningful historical analysis. These solutions are based on theenforcement of the distinction between transaction time and valid time within the model thatrepresents the fact of interest. In particular; we show how late registrations can be differentlysupported depending on the flow or stock semantics given to events.,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2006,17
Vertical Fragmentation of Views in Relational Data Warehouses.,Matteo Golfarelli; Dario Maio; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract. Within the framework of the data warehouse design methodology we aredeveloping; in this paper we investigate the problem of vertical fragmentation of relationalviews aimed at minimizing the global query response time. Each view includes severalmeasures which; within the workload; are seldom requested together; thus; the systemperformance may be increased by partitioning the views to be materialized into smallertables. On the other hand; drill-across queries involve measures taken from two or moreviews; in this case the access costs may be decreased by unifying these views into largertables. Within the data warehouse context; the presence of redundant views makes thefragmentation problem more complex than in traditional relational databases since itrequires to decide on which views each query should be executed. After formalizing the …,SEBD,1999,16
Qbx: a case tool for data mart design,Antonino Battaglia; Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract QBX is a CASE tool for data mart design resulting from a close collaborationbetween academy and industry. It supports designers during conceptual design; logicaldesign; and deployment of ROLAP data marts in the form of star/snowflake schemata; and itcan also be used by business users to interactively explore project-related knowledge atdifferent levels of abstraction. We will demonstrate QBX functionalities focusing on bothforward and reverse engineering scenarios.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2011,15
Preference-based datacube analysis with MYOLAP,Paolo Biondi; Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi,In this demonstration we present MYOLAP; a Java-based tool that allows OLAP analyses tobe personalized and enhanced by expressing “soft” query constraints in the form of userpreferences. MYOLAP is based on a novel preference algebra and a preference evaluationalgorithm specifically devised for the OLAP domain. Preferences are formulated eithervisually or through an extension of the MDX language; and user interaction with the resultsis mediated by a visual graph-like structure that shows better-than relationships betweendifferent sets of data. The demonstration will show how analysis sessions can benefit fromcoupling ad-hoc preference constructors with the classical OLAP operators; and in particularhow MYOLAP supports users in expressing preference queries; analyzing their results; andnavigating datacubes.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on,2011,15
DFM as a Conceptual Model for Data Warehouse,Matteo Golfarelli,Abstract Conceptual modeling is widely recognized to be the necessary foundation forbuilding a database that is well-documented and fully satisfies the user requirements. Inparticular; from the designer point of view the availability of a conceptual model provides ahigher level of abstraction in describing the warehousing process and its architecture in allits aspects. Typically conceptual models rely on a graphical notation that facilitates writing;understanding; and managing conceptual schemata by both designers and users. TheEntity/Relationship (E/R) model (Chen; 1976) is widespread in the enterprises as aconceptual formalism to provide standard documentation for relational information systems;nevertheless; as E/R is oriented to support queries that navigate associations between datarather than synthesize them; it is not well-suited for data warehousing (Kimball; 1998) …,*,2009,15
New trends in Business Intelligence.,Matteo Golfarelli,Abstract-Today; as DWing reached a high level of efficiency; new opportunities in exploitinginformation coming from the operational databases are requested by users. Consequently;we believe that in the next future the interests of researchers will be more and more orientedto BI applications while DW will play the role of an on the shelf module within a large set ofresources placed at the knowledge workers disposal with the aim of exploiting at best theinformation encrypted in the operational data. The aim of this paper is to sketch our ideaabout the develop prospects for BI and to report in detail one of the most promising evolutionin this direction: Business Performance Management.,miproBIS,2005,15
The workload you have; the workload you would like,Matteo Golfarelli; Ettore Saltarelli,Abstract Real data warehouse workloads are often too large and complex to be directlyoptimized using the algorithms proposed in the literature for view materialization andindexing. In this paper we propose the idea of profile as an instrument for summarizing theworkload features in order to help the designer to make the right choices. The ability of theprofile to characterize a workload is then exploited to move backward using it as an input foran algorithm that generates a set of queries presenting the desired features. The algorithmproposed is finally used for creating the workloads necessary for testing the correspondencebetween different profiles and the results of optimization.,Proceedings of the 6th ACM international workshop on Data warehousing and OLAP,2003,15
Towards OLAP query reformulation in peer-to-peer data warehousing,Matteo Golfarelli; Federica Mandreoli; Wilma Penzo; Stefano Rizzi; Elisa Turricchia,Abstract Inter-business collaborative contexts prefigure a distributed scenario wherecompanies organize and coordinate themselves to develop common and sharedopportunities. Traditional business intelligence systems do not provide support to this end.Peer Data Management Systems (PDMSs) have been proposed as architectures to supportsharing of operational data across networks of peers while guaranteeing peers' autonomy;based on semantic mappings that mediate between the heterogeneous schemata exposedby peers. In line with the PDMS infrastructure; in this paper we envision a peer-to-peer datawarehousing architecture based on a network of heterogeneous peers; each exposingquery answering functionalities aimed at sharing business information.

Clustering techniques for protein surfaces,Lorenzo Baldacci; Matteo Golfarelli; Alessandra Lumini; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract Though most approaches to protein comparison are based on their structure;several studies produced evidence of a strict correlation between the surface characteristicsof proteins and the way they interact. Surface-based techniques for protein comparisontypically require applying clustering algorithms to the punctual 3D description of the surfacein order to produce a compact surface representation; capable of effectively condensing itsdescription. In this paper; we propose a formalization of the requirements for surfaceclustering in the biochemical context and present two different clustering techniques thatmeet them; based; respectively; on region-growing and on an original template matchingalgorithm. We discuss the validity of these techniques with the support of tests performed ona set of about one hundred protein models generated by punctual mutations of four …,Pattern recognition,2006,13
Multi-sprint planning and smooth replanning: An optimization model,Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi; Elisa Turricchia,Abstract Most agile methods divide a project into sprints (iterations); and include a sprintplanning phase that is critical to ensure the project success. Several factors impact on theoptimality of a sprint plan; which makes the planning problem difficult. In this paper weformalize the planning problem and propose an optimization model that; given the estimatesmade by the project team and a set of development constraints; produces a multi-sprintoptimal plan that maximizes the business value perceived by users. To cope with theinherent flexibility and uncertainty of agile projects; our approach ensures that a baselineplan can be revised and re-optimized during project execution without disrupting it; whichwe call smooth replanning.

An ANTS algorithm for optimizing the materialization of fragmented views in data warehouses: Preliminary results,Vittorio Maniezzo; Antonella Carbonaro; Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract The materialization of fragmented views in data warehouses has the objective ofimproving the system response time for a given workload. It represents a combinatorialoptimization problem arising in the logical design of data warehouses which has so farreceived little attention from the optimization community. This paper describes theapplication of a metaheuristic approach; namely the ANTS approach; to this problem. Inparticular; we propose an integer programming formulation of the problem; derive anefficient lower bound and embed it in an ANTS algorithm.

A methodology for social BI,Matteo Francia; Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract Social BI (SBI) is the emerging discipline that aims at combining corporate data withtextual user-generated content (UGC) to let decision-makers analyze their business basedon the trends perceived from the environment. Despite the increasing diffusion of SBIapplications; no specific and organic design methodology is available yet. In this paper wepropose an iterative methodology for designing and maintaining SBI applications thatreorganizes the activities and tasks normally carried out by practitioners. Effective support toquick maintenance iterations is a key feature in this context due to the huge dynamism of theUGC and to the pressing need of immediately perceiving and timely reacting to changes inthe environment. The paper is completed by two case studies of real SBI projects; related toItalian politics and to the consumer goods area respectively; aimed at proving that the …,Proceedings of the 18th International Database Engineering & Applications Symposium,2014,10

Handling large workloads by profiling and clustering,Matteo Golfarelli,Abstract View materialization is recognized to be one of the most effective ways to increasethe Data Warehouse performance; nevertheless; due to the computational complexity of thetechniques aimed at choosing the best set of views to be materialized; this task is mainlycarried out manually when large workloads are involved. In this paper we propose a set ofstatistical indicators that can be used by the designer to characterize the workload of theData Warehouse; thus driving the logical and physical optimization tasks; furthermore wepropose a clustering algorithm that allows the cardinality of the workload to be reduced anduses these indicators for measuring the quality of the reduced workload. Using the reducedworkload as the input to a view materialization algorithm allows large workloads to beefficiently handled.,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2003,9
Lily: a geo-enhanced library for location intelligence,Matteo Golfarelli; Marco Mantovani; Federico Ravaldi; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract Location intelligence is a set of tools and techniques to integrate a geographicaldimension into BI platforms; aimed at enhancing their capability of better monitoring andinterpreting business events. Though most commercial data warehouse tools haveimplemented spatial extensions to support GIS integration; the user experience with spatialdata is still mostly limited to the visualization of maps labeled with numerical indicators. Toovercome this limit we developed Lily; a geo-enhanced library that adds true locationintelligence capabilities to existing BI platforms. Lily provides end-users with a highly-interactive interface that seamlessly achieves a bidirectional integration between the BI andthe geospatial worlds; so as to enable advanced analytical features that truly take intoaccount the spatial dimension.

BIN: Business intelligence networks,Matteo Golfarelli; Federica Mandreoli; Wilma Penzo; Stefano Rizzi; Elisa Turricchia,Abstract Cooperation is seen by companies as one of the major means for increasingflexibility and innovating. Business intelligence (BI) platforms are aimed at serving individualcompanies; and they cannot operate over networks of companies characterized by anorganizational; lexical; and semantic heterogeneity. In this chapter we propose a framework;called Business Intelligence Network (BIN); for sharing BI functionalities over complexnetworks of companies that are chasing mutual advantages through the sharing of strategicinformation. A BIN is based on a network of peers; one for each company participating in theconsortium. Peers are equipped with independent BI platforms that expose some queryingfunctionalities aimed at sharing business information for the decision-making process.

On Estimating the Cardinality of Aggregate Views.,Paolo Ciaccia; Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract Accurately estimating the cardinality of aggregate views is crucial for logical andphysical design of data warehouses. While the warehouse is under development and dataare not available yet; the approaches based on accessing data cannot be adopted. Thispaper proposes an approach to estimate the cardinality of views based on a-prioriinformation derived from the application domain. We face the problem by first computingsatisfactory bounds for the cardinality; then by capitalizing on these bounds to determine agood probabilistic estimate for it. Bounds are determined by using; besides the functionaldependencies expressed by the multidimensional scheme; additional domain-derivedinformation in the form of cardinality constraints which may bound either the cardinality of agiven view or the ratio between the cardinalities of two given views. In particular; we …,DMDW,2001,8
A hierarchical approach to sonar-based landmark detection in mobile robots,Stefano Rizzi; Dario Maio; Matteo Golfarelli,Abstract. Landmark recognition in autonomous robots entails extracting symbolic informationfrom sensory data; and is a crucial phase in bridging the gap between the symbolic and thesub-symbolic worlds. In this paper we propose a technique which identifies landmarks bymatching a set of templates with a local occupancy grid built by sonar measures; anothercoarse-grained occupancy grid is used to decide when and where template matching isuseful. Our approach is robust since the occupancy grid is a probabilistic model whichrepresents the uncertainty on sensory data; hence; it may work well even on incomplete ornoisy landmark shapes. It is fast since; during template matching; the second-leveloccupancy grid enables the search area to be restricted; thus; the other activities of the robotare not slowed down.

A Lagrangian heuristic for sprint planning in agile software development,Marco A Boschetti; Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi; Elisa Turricchia,Abstract Agile methods for software development promote iterative design andimplementation.

The sprint planningphase is critical to ensure the project success; but it is also a difficult problem becauseseveral factors impact on the optimality of a sprint plan; eg; the estimated complexity;business value; and affinity of the user stories to be included in each sprint.

Starry vault: Automating multidimensional modeling from data vaults,Matteo Golfarelli; Simone Graziani; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract The data vault model natively supports data and schema evolution; so it is oftenadopted to create operational data stores. However; it can hardly be directly used for OLAPquerying. In this paper we propose an approach called Starry Vault for finding amultidimensional structure in data vaults. Starry Vault builds on the specific features of thedata vault model to automate multidimensional modeling; and uses approximate functionaldependencies to discover out of data the information necessary to infer the structure ofmultidimensional hierarchies. The manual intervention by the user is limited to some editingof the resulting multidimensional schemata; which makes the overall process simple andquick enough to be compatible with the situational analysis needs of a data scientist.,East European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems,2016,6
Shrink: an OLAP operation for balancing precision and size of pivot tables,Matteo Golfarelli; Simone Graziani; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract Information flooding may occur during an OLAP session when the user drills downher cube up to a very fine-grained level; because the huge number of facts returned makes itvery hard to analyze them using a pivot table. To overcome this problem we propose a novelOLAP operation; called shrink; aimed at balancing data precision with data size in cubevisualization via pivot tables. The shrink operation fuses slices of similar data and replacesthem with a single representative slice; respecting the constraints suggested by dimensionhierarchies; until the result has either size or error smaller than a given threshold. An optimalcomputation of the shrink operation has exponential complexity; so we present both agreedy algorithm based on agglomerative clustering; which returns a sub-optimal solution;and a branch-and-bound algorithm that returns an optimal solution.

Temporal data warehousing: Approaches and techniques,Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract Data warehouses are information repositories specialized in supporting decisionmaking. Since the decisional process typically requires an analysis of historical trends; timeand its management acquire a huge importance. In this paper we consider the variety ofissues; often grouped under term temporal data warehousing; implied by the need foraccurately describing how information changes over time in data warehousing systems. Werecognize that; with reference to a three-levels architecture; these issues can be classifiedinto some topics; namely: handling data/schema changes in the data warehouse; handlingdata/schema changes in the data mart; querying temporal data; and designing temporaldata warehouses.

The idea of collaborative business intelligence is to extend the decision-makingprocess beyond the company boundaries thanks to cooperation and data sharing with othercompanies and organizations. In this direction; we propose a query reformulation frameworkbased on a P2P network of heterogeneous peers; each exposing OLAP query answeringfunctionalities aimed at sharing business information. In our framework; an OLAP queryexpressed on a peer is reformulated on other peers by relying on a set of mappings betweenthe multidimensional schemata of peers. In this extended abstract we sketch the userinteraction scenario we envision and briefly discuss each phase of the reformulationprocess.,SEBD,2012,5
Visual modelling of Data Warehousing Flows with UML profiles,Jesús Pardillo; Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi; Juan Trujillo,Abstract Data warehousing involves complex processes that transform source data throughseveral stages to deliver suitable information ready to be analysed. Though manytechniques for visual modelling of data warehouses from the static point of view have beendevised; only few attempts have been made to model the data flows involved in a datawarehousing process. Besides; each attempt was mainly aimed at a specific application;such as ETL; OLAP; what-if analysis; data mining. Data flows are typically very complex inthis domain; for this reason; we argue; designers would greatly benefit from a technique foruniformly modelling data warehousing flows for all applications. In this paper; we proposean integrated visual modelling technique for data cubes and data flows.

In this paper; we study some aspects of the coordination problem faced by apopulation of self-interested interacting agents; from the perspective of 2-players repeatedgames. We propose an optimality criterion based on the maximax concept and we show theexistence of an equilibrium point with respect to this criterion. In order to prove the existancesuch equilibrium point we introduce an equivalent bi-matrix game that can be successfullysolved and we discuss approximate techniques that could be adopted when the complexityof the problem becomes too high.

In this paper we outline an approach that enables users to extendthe hierarchies in their corporate cubes through a user-guided process that exploresselected linked data and derives hierarchies from them. This is done by identifying in thelinked data the recurring modeling patterns that express roll-up relationships between RDFconcepts and translating them into multidimensional knowledge.,24th Italian Symposium on Advanced Database Systems; SEBD 2016: Ugento; Lecce; Italy; June 19-22; 2016,2016,3
A characterization of hierarchical computable distance functions for data warehouse systems,Matteo Golfarelli; Elisa Turricchia,Abstract A data warehouse is a huge multidimensional repository used for statistical analysisof historical data. In a data warehouse events are modeled as multidimensional cubeswhere cells store numerical indicators while dimensions describe the events from differentpoints of view. Dimensions are typically described at different levels of details throughhierarchies of concepts. Computing the distance/similarity between two cells has severalapplications in this domain. In this context distance is typically based on the least commonancestor between attribute values; but the effectiveness of such distance functions variesaccording to the structure and to the number of the involved hierarchies. In this paper wepropose a characterization of hierarchy types based on their structure and expressiveness;we provide a characterization of the different types of distance functions and we verify …,Decision Support Systems,2014,3

Comparing nested GPSJ queries in multidimensional databases,Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi,ABSTRACT A multidimensional database can be seen as a collection of multidimensionalcubes; from which information is usually extracted by aggregation; aggregated data can becalculated either from cubes containing elemental data or from views in which partiallyaggregated data are stored. Thus; view materialization and run-time optimization throughquery rewriting become crucial issues in determining the overall performance. The capabilityof matching two queries is necessary to address both issues; unfortunately; most works inthis field consider only simple categories of queries.

An OLAM Operator for Multi-Dimensional Shrink,Stefano Rizzi; Matteo Golfarelli; Simone Graziani,Abstract Shrink is an OLAM (On-Line Analytical Mining) operator based on hierarchicalclustering; and it has been previously proposed in mono-dimensional form to balanceprecision with size in the visualization of cubes via pivot tables during OLAP analyses. It canbe applied to the cube resulting from a query to decrease its size while controlling theapproximation introduced; the idea is to fuse similar facts together and replace them with asingle representative fact; respecting the bounds posed by dimension hierarchies. In thispaper the authors propose a multi-dimensional generalization of the shrink operator; wherefacts are fused along multiple dimensions. Multi-dimensional shrink comes in two flavors:lazy and eager; where the bounds posed by hierarchies are respectively weaker and stricter.Greedy algorithms based on agglomerative clustering are presented for both lazy and …,International Journal of Data Warehousing and Mining (IJDWM),2015,2

The OLAP domain is representative of an unexplored class of preference queries;characterized by three peculiarities: preferences can be expressed on both numerical andcategorical domains; they can also be expressed on the aggregation level of facts; the spaceon which preferences are expressed includes both elemental and aggregated facts. In thispaper we propose a preference algebra for OLAP; devised by taking into account the threepeculiarities above. In particular; users are enabled to express their preferences also on theaggregation level of facts; for instance by stating that monthly data are preferred to yearly …,DEIS; University of Bologna; Viale Risorgimento,2008,2
A Template-Matching Approach for Protein Surface Clustering,Lorenzo Baldacci; Matteo Golfarelli; Alessandra Lumini; Stefano Rizzi,Surface-based techniques for protein comparison and classification typically require acompact surface representation; capable of effectively condensing its description. In thispaper we propose an original template-matching algorithm for multi-feature surfaceclustering in the biochemical context. The effectiveness of our clustering algorithm incapturing surface similarities is then discussed within a larger framework for proteinclassification based on surface comparison; with the support of tests performed on a datasetincluding 25 proteins,Pattern Recognition; 2006.

Mining complex patterns from protein surfaces,Lorenzo Baldacci; Matteo Golfarelli,In the domain of bioinformatics; the role played in the biological process by proteins; that actas transmitters and receivers of information thus ruling the mechanisms that determine howorganic systems function; has great importance. Recent studies produced evidence of astrict correlation between the surface characteristics of proteins and the way they interact. Inthis paper we propose an original approach for discovering protein similarities based ontheir surface characteristics represented in terms of surface patterns. The approach startsfrom a detailed representation of the protein surfaces and determines a set of characteristicregions that defines a compact representation of the protein surface that is the input for anad-hoc data mining technique used to find the frequent patterns. Tests; carried out on abenchmark dataset of molecules with suitably designed surface mutations; show that …,Database and Expert Systems Applications; 2005. Proceedings.

Meta-Stars: Dynamic; Schemaless; and Semantically-Rich Topic Hierarchies in Social BI.,Enrico Gallinucci; Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi,ABSTRACT A key role in OLAP analyses of textual user-generated content for socialbusiness intelligence (SBI) is played by topics; ie; concepts of interest within a subject area.Topic hierarchies are irregular; heterogeneous; dynamic; and possibly schemaless; besides;unlike in traditional OLAP; different semantics for topic aggregation can be envisioned. Inthis demonstration we present an architecture for SBI based on meta-stars; a novelapproach to topic modeling in ROLAP systems. By coupling meta-modeling with navigationtables; meta-stars can cope with changes in the schema of irregular hierarchies and withschemaless ones; besides; they enable a new class of OLAP queries based on semantically-aware aggregation. The demonstration will focus both on the hierarchy update process andon the querying expressiveness.,EDBT,2015,1

Efficient derivation of numerical dependencies,Paolo Ciaccia; Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract Numerical dependencies (NDs) are database constraints that limit the number ofdistinct Y-values that can appear together with any X-value; where both X and Y are sets ofattributes in a relation schema. While it is known that NDs are not finitely axiomatizable;there is no study on how to efficiently derive NDs using a set of sound (yet necessarilyincomplete) rules. In this paper; after proving that solving the entailment problem for NDsusing the chase procedure has exponential space complexity; we show that; given a set ofinference rules similar to those used for functional dependencies; the membership problemfor NDs is NP-hard. We then provide a graph-based characterization of NDs; which isexploited to design an efficient branch & bound algorithm for ND derivation.

Using Domain-Derived Constraints to Bound the Cardinality of Aggregate Views.,Paolo Ciaccia; Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract. Accurately estimating the cardinality of aggregate views is crucial for logical andphysical design of data warehouses. While the warehouse is under development and dataare not available yet; the approaches based on accessing data cannot be adopted. Thispaper reports on the progress of an ongoing research aimed at devising a comprehensiveapproach to estimate the cardinality of views based on a-priori information derived from theapplication domain. The results we present concern the computation of upper and lowerbounds for the cardinality of a view considering the functional dependencies betweenattributes of the multidimensional scheme and a set of cardinality constraints expressed onsome other views. We propose a bounding strategy which achieves an effective trade-offbetween the tightness of the bounds produced and the computational complexity; and …,SEBD,2001,1
A Role-Based Architecture For A Mobile Robot,Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract. In this paper we describe the control architecture we are experimenting on aPioneer I mobile platform. Its building blocks are called roles and are characterized byestablishing a cognitive parallel with the roles played by the different crew members on asubmarine entrusted with navigation tasks on unexplored soundings. The differentbehaviors are determined by a team-work involving all roles; thus; the definition of role isorthogonal to that of behavior. On the other hand; roles are tightly related to the knowledgearchitecture adopted to represent the environment; and reflect the separation betweensymbolic and sub-symbolic representation of the environment enforced by the presence oflandmarks. After describing each role and its activities; and outlining the inter-role pattern ofcommunication; we present some experimental tests.,Proc. of 6th Symposium on Intelligent Robotics Systems,1999,1

Schema Profiling of Document-Oriented Databases,Enrico Gallinucci; Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract In document-oriented databases; schema is a soft concept and the documents in acollection can be stored using different local schemata.

Variety-Aware OLAP of Document-Oriented Databases,Enrico Gallinucci; Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi,ABSTRACT Schemaless databases; and document-oriented databases in particular; arepreferred to relational ones for storing heterogeneous data with variable schemas andstructural forms. However; the absence of a unique schema adds complexity to analyticalapplications; in which a single analysis often involves large sets of data with differentschemas. In this paper we propose an original approach to OLAP on collections stored indocument-oriented databases. The basic idea is to stop fighting against schema variety andwelcome it as an inherent source of information wealth in schemaless sources. Ourapproach builds on four stages: schema extraction; schema integration; FD enrichment; andquerying; these stages are discussed in detail in the paper. To make users aware of theimpact of schema variety; we propose a set of indicators related for instance to query …,*,2018,*
Goal-Based Selection of Visual Representations for Big Data Analytics,Matteo Golfarelli; Tommaso Pirini; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract The H2020 TOREADOR Project adopts a model-driven architecture to streamlinebig data analytics and make it widely available to companies as a service. Our work in thiscontext focuses on visualization; in particular on how to automate the translation of thevisualization objectives declared by the user into a suitable visualization type. To this endwe first define a visualization context based on seven prioritizable coordinates for assessingthe user's objectives and describing the data to be visualized; then we propose a skyline-based technique for automatically translating a visualization context into a set of suitablevisualization types. Finally; we evaluate our approach on a real use case excerpted from thepilot applications of TOREADOR.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2017,*
QETL: An approach to on-demand ETL from non-owned data sources,Lorenzo Baldacci; Matteo Golfarelli; Simone Graziani; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract In traditional OLAP systems; the ETL process loads all available data in the datawarehouse before users start querying them. In some cases; this may be either inconvenient(because data are supplied from a provider for a fee) or unfeasible (because of their size);on the other hand; directly launching each analysis query on source data would not enabledata reuse; leading to poor performance and high costs. The alternative investigated in thispaper is that of fetching and storing data on-demand; ie; as they are needed during theanalysis process. In this direction we propose the Query-Extract-Transform-Load (QETL)paradigm to feed a multidimensional cube; the idea is to fetch facts from the source dataprovider; load them into the cube only when they are needed to answer some OLAP query;and drop them when some free space is needed to load other facts.

What-if analysis fills this gap by enabling users to simulate andinspect the behavior of a complex system under some given hypotheses. A crucial issue inthe design of what-if applications is to find an adequate formalism to conceptually expressthe underlying simulation model. In this paper we report on how; within the framework of acomprehensive design methodology; this can be accomplished by extending UML 2 with aset of stereotypes.

Efficiently Bounding Cardinality Ratios through Database Constraints.,Paolo Ciaccia; Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract. Numerical dependencies (NDs) are a type of database constraints in which onelimits the number of distinct Y-values that can appear together with any X-value; where bothX and Y are sets of attributes. The seminal work by Grant and Minker has shown that NDsare not finitely axiomatizable; which has cut further investigation on this kind of constraints.In this paper we show that; given a set of sound inference rules similar to those used forfunctional dependencies; the membership problem for NDs is NP-hard; and propose abranch & bound algorithm for efficiently solving the problem. The algorithms adopts a suiteof optimization strategies that make it applicable in practice; providing considerable speed-up over a naıve approach.,SEBD,2010,*

in Logical Design of Multidimensional Databases',Matteo Golfarelli; Dario Maio; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract. In the context of multidimensional databases implemented on relational DBMSsthrough star schemes; the most effective technique to enhance performances consists ofmaterializing redundant aggregates called views. In this paper we investigate the problem ofvertical fragmentation of views aimed at minimizing the workload response time. Each viewincludes several measures which not necessarily are always requested together; thus; thesystem performance may be increased by partitioning the views into smaller tables. On theother hand; drill-across queries involve measures taken from two or more views; in this casethe access costs may be decreased by unifying these views into larger tables. Afterformalizing the fragmentation problem as a 0–1 integer linear programming problem; wedefine a cost function and outline a branch-and-bound algorithm to minimize it.

A Model of Partially Observable State Game and its Optimality,Matteo Golfarelli; Nicolas Meuleau,Abstract In this paper we present a model of two-players partially observable “state-game”and study its optimality. The model is inspired by the practical problem of negotiation in amulti-agent system and formulates; from a the game theory point of view; the so-calledcontract net protocol. It covers a wide variety of real problems including some simple cardgames such as blackjack; and many negotiation and bargaining situations. The results thatfollow are valid for non-zero-sum games as well as for zero-sum games. Basically; weestablish and prove the relation between partially observable state games and someclassical (single-state) bi-matrix games. If the original state game is zero-sum; then theequivalent bi-matrix game is so.,Applied Intelligence,2001,*

In multi-agent systems; agents may cooperate to decrease the task executioncosts; the Contract Net Protocol is an approach to negotiation of tasks based on theannouncement-bid-award mechanism. If the agents do not own money; they can decreasetheir costs only by swapping tasks with other agents; unfortunately; swapping only singletasks may trap negotiation in local minima of the cost. In this paper we show how the utility ofnegotiations can be increased by allowing tasks to be swapped in non-disjoint clusters.Clustering of tasks is carried out; in a fuzzy fashion; according to two orthogonal dimensionswhich consider; respectively; the spatial disposition of the resources within the …,Intelligent Autonomous Systems 6,2000,*

Realizzazione di un sistema di Social Business Intelligence basato sul motore SPSS,Diego Lanzoni,Negli ultimi anni; stiamo assistendo ad un enorme sviluppo delle reti sociali sul web; favoritoanche dai recenti progressi in ambito tecnologico (pensiamo ad esempio alla diffusione deidispositivi mobile); che consentono in tempo reale lo scambio continuo di informazioni. Leesperienze personali condivise nel web 2.0 influenzano migliaia di persone vicine olontanissime; in modo diretto; immediato e soprattutto efficace. Questa mole diconversazioni e di informazioni presenti online; costituiscono una “miniera di conoscenza”incredibilmente utile; costituita da esperienze; opinioni; commenti che riguardano prodotti;servizi; brand; singoli individui ed organizzazioni; all'interno di blog; forum e per ultimi; disocial network. Se non vogliamo farci sfuggire queste preziose informazioni dobbiamoascoltare la rete; vale a dire; dobbiamo intercettare ed estrarre ogni giorno i dati rilevanti …,*,*,*

Progettazione di un sistema proattivo per l'identificazione di aggregati,Matteo Corfiati,Nel lavoro di tesi è stato studiato il problema del tuning di un data warehouse; in particolarela tecnica maggiormente utilizzata in ambito aziendale; ovvero la creazione degli aggregati.Inoltre; è stato progettato e implementato uno strumento che generi automaticamentel'insieme di viste che meglio risolve il carico di lavoro basato sulle analisi di business piùfrequenti su quella specifica base di dati.,*,*,*
Shrink: un nuovo operatore OLAP per la presentazione di risultati approssimati,Simone Graziani,In ambito business intelligence OLAP—On-Line Analytical Processing—e il paradigmaprincipale per interrogare basi di dati multidimensionali e analizzare grandi quantita di dati.In una tipica sessione OLAP l'utente richiede un insieme di valori di misure corrispondentiad una certa prospettiva di analisi e tramite una serie di operazioni trasforma la queryiniziale fino ad arrivare ad un risultato per lui piu interessante. Spesso pero si presenta ilproblema di trovare un giusto compromesso tra quantita di dati visualizzati e precisionedegli stessi: piu dati danno piu informazioni ma possono nascondere trend generali erichiedono uno sforzo di analisi maggiore all'utente; d'altra parte meno dati rendono difficileindividuare trend su piccola scala. Il problema descrittoe particolarmente evidente quandovengono utilizzate rappresentazioni testuali come le pivot table per visualizzare i dati …,*,*,*

Solving Open Polygonals in Elastic Correction of Dead-Reckoning Errors,Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract:-A major problem in map building is due to the imprecision of sensor measures. In aprevious paper we proposed a technique; called elastic correction; for correcting the dead-reckoning errors made during the exploration of an unknown environment by a robotcapable of identifying landmarks. Elastic correction is based on an analogy between therelational graph modelling the environment and a mechanical structure: the map is regardedas a truss where each route is an elastic bar and each landmark a node; errors are correctedas a result of the deformations induced from the forces arising within the structure asinconsistent measures are taken. The main weakness of this method lies in the waypositional inconsistencies are solved when routes are covered for the first time. In this paperwe improve first-sight elastic correction by replacing the heuristics previously adopted …,*,*,*
A survey of Logical and Physical Design Issues,Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi,Abstract. The bulk of the research on Data Warehousing is concentrated on logical andphysical issues; since they mainly determine the system performance. As to relational DataWarehouse; the logical issues concern the definition of the relational structure of the DW andthose optimizations that can be carried out by tuning such structures; while physical issuesmainly deal with the index selection problem. The research carried out in the last ten yearsproduced a lot of interesting results that are essential to reduce the query response time.The scope of this paper is to survey the main results in the literature as a base for theresearch in the ongoing project.,*,*,*

Metaphor-based Semantic Browsing in M-FIRE,Andrea Proli; Stefano Rizzi; Matteo Golfarelli,Though the syntax of RDF is designed to be humanreadable; most end-users are notfamiliar with it. Thus; tools have been developed that (1) generate visual presentations ofRDF statements and (2) translate user actions performed on those presentations intoqueries over the RDF knowledge base. An open problem in this field is to guarantee asatisfactory compromise between expressivity and domain-independence. The former ismeant as the capability of delivering an intuitive visualization of knowledge and sometailored navigation primitives to end-users working in a given application domain; while thelatter is aimed at accomplishing a high degree of reusability. Most existing tools; eg [2; 3];favor domain-independence by visually presenting constructs–such as classes andspecializations–that are familiar to knowledge engineers but not to domain experts.

OS BI: Open Research Issues,Matteo Golfarelli; Stefano Rizzi; Yannis Velegrakis,Abstract Business Intelligence can be defined as the process of turning data into informationand then into knowledge. Business Intelligence systems are centered on data warehouses:large repositories of historical data; organized according to the multidimensional model. Inspite of the large amount of research carried out in the last 20 years; the modern end-to-endbusiness intelligence platforms seem to suffer from the increased/changed user needs. Thisis a consequence of the growth of the business intelligence culture within enterprises on theone hand; and a side effect of the mutated business panorama on the other. While in thepast the business intelligence market was strictly dominated by closed source andcommercial tools; the last few years were characterized by the birth of open sourcesolutions. Commercial platforms are commonly considered superior to open source ones …,*,*,*
