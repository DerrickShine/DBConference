Supporting structured credentials and sensitive policies through interoperable strategies for automated trust negotiation,Ting Yu; Marianne Winslett; Kent E Seamons,Abstract Business and military partners; companies and their customers; and other closelycooperating parties may have a compelling need to conduct sensitive interactions on line;such as accessing each other's local services and other local resources. Automated trustnegotiation is an approach to establishing trust between parties so that such interactions cantake place; through the use of access control policies that specify what combinations ofdigital credentials a stranger must disclose to gain access to a local resource. A party canuse many different strategies to negotiate trust; offering tradeoffs between the length of thenegotiation; the amount of extraneous information disclosed; and the computational effortexpended. To preserve parties' autonomy; each party should ideally be able to choose itsnegotiation strategy independently; while still being guaranteed that negotiations will …,ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC),2003,387
Aggregate query answering on anonymized tables,Qing Zhang; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava; Ting Yu,Privacy is a serious concern when microdata need to be released for ad hoc analyses. Theprivacy goals of existing privacy protection approaches (eg; k-anonymity and l-diversity) aresuitable only for categorical sensitive attributes. Since applying them directly to numericalsensitive attributes (eg; salary) may result in undesirable information leakage; we proposeprivacy goals to better capture the need of privacy protection for numerical sensitiveattributes. Complementing the desire for privacy is the need to support ad hoc aggregateanalyses over microdata. Existing generalization-based anonymization approaches cannotanswer aggregate queries with reasonable accuracy. We present a general framework ofpermutation-based anonymization to support accurate answering of aggregate queries andshow that; for the same grouping; permutation-based techniques can always answer …,Data Engineering; 2007.

A unified scheme for resource protection in automated trust negotiation,Ting Yu; Marianne Winslett,Automated trust negotiation is an approach to establishing trust between strangers throughiterative disclosure of digital credentials. In automated trust negotiation; access controlpolicies play a key role in protecting resources from unauthorized access. Unlike intraditional trust management systems; the access control policy for a resource is usuallyunknown to the party requesting access to the resource; when trust negotiation starts. Thenegotiating parties can rely on policy disclosures to learn each other's access controlrequirements. However a policy itself may also contain sensitive information. Disclosingpolicies' contents unconditionally may leak valuable business information or jeopardizeindividuals' privacy. In this paper we propose UniPro; a unified scheme to model protectionof resources; including policies; in trust negotiation. UniPro improves on previous work by …,Security and Privacy; 2003.

Limiting the Disclosure of Access Control Policies during Automated Trust Negotiation.,Kent E Seamons; Marianne Winslett; Ting Yu,ABSTRACT Automated trust negotiation is a new approach to establishing trust betweenstrangers through the exchange ofdigital credentials and the use ofmobile access controlpolicies that specify what combinations of credentials a stranger must supply in order to gainaccess to each local service or credential. In this paper; we show that access control policiescan also contain sensitive information that should be protected from inappropriate access bystrangers during negotiation. We present and analyze two automated trust negotiationstrategies that support protection for access control policies. The first is the relevantcredentials set strategy; which does not directly disclose access control policies and has afast running time; but may disclose more credentials than strictly necessary. The secondstrategy is the all relevant policies strategy; which freely discloses all relevant access …,NDSS,2001,234
Interoperable strategies in automated trust negotiation,Ting Yu; Marianne Winslett; Kent E Seamons,Abstract Automated trust negotiation is an approach to establishing trust between strangersthrough the exchange of digital credentials and the use of access control policies thatspecify what combinations of credentials a stranger must disclose in order to gain access toeach local service or credential. We introduce the concept of a trust negotiation protocol;which defines the ordering of messages and the type of information messages will contain.To carry out trust negotiation; a party pairs its negotiation protocol with a trust negotiationstrategy that controls the exact content of the messages; ie; which credentials to disclose;when to disclose them; and when to terminate a negotiation. There are a huge number ofpossible strategies for negotiating trust; each with different properties with respect to speedof negotiations and caution in giving out credentials and policies.

Approximate XML joins,Sudipto Guha; HV Jagadish; Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava; Ting Yu,Abstract XML is widely recognized as the data interchange standard for tomorrow; becauseof its ability to represent data from a wide variety sources. Hence; XML is likely to be theformat through which data from multiple sources is integrated. In this paper we study theproblem of integrating XML data sources through correlations realized as join operations. Achallenging aspect of this operation is the XML document structure. Two documents mightconvey approximately or exactly the same information but may be quite different in structure.Consequently approximate match in structure; in addition to; content has to be folded in thejoin operation. We quantify approximate match in structure and content using well definednotions of distance. For structure; we propose computationally inexpensive lower and upperbounds for the tree edit distance metric between two trees.

Requirements for policy languages for trust negotiation,Kent E Seamons; Marianne Winslett; Ting Yu; Bryan Smith; Evan Child; Jared Jacobson; Hyrum Mills; Lina Yu,In open systems like the Internet; traditional approaches to security based on identity do notprovide a solution to the problem of establishing trust between strangers; because strangersdo not share the same security domain. A new approach to establishing trust betweenstrangers is trust negotiation; the bilateral exchange of digital credentials describingattributes of the negotiation participants. This approach relies on access control policies thatgovern access to protected resources by specifying credential combinations that must besubmitted to obtain authorization. We describe a model for trust negotiation; focusing on thecentral role of policies. We delineate requirements for policy languages and runtime systemsfor trust negotiation; and evaluate four existing policy languages for trust management withrespect to those requirements. We conclude with recommendations for extending existing …,Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks; 2002. Proceedings. Third International Workshop on,2002,195
Anonymizing bipartite graph data using safe groupings,Graham Cormode; Divesh Srivastava; Ting Yu; Qing Zhang,Abstract Private data often comes in the form of associations between entities; such ascustomers and products bought from a pharmacy; which are naturally represented in theform of a large; sparse bipartite graph. As with tabular data; it is desirable to be able topublish anonymized versions of such data; to allow others to perform ad hoc analysis ofaggregate graph properties. However; existing tabular anonymization techniques do notgive useful or meaningful results when applied to graphs: small changes or masking of theedge structure can radically change aggregate graph properties. We introduce a new familyof anonymizations; for bipartite graph data; called (k; l)-groupings. These groupingspreserve the underlying graph structure perfectly; and instead anonymize the mapping fromentities to nodes of the graph. We identify a class of" safe"(k; l)-groupings that have …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,178
Differentially private spatial decompositions,Graham Cormode; Cecilia Procopiuc; Divesh Srivastava; Entong Shen; Ting Yu,Differential privacy has recently emerged as the de facto standard for private data release.This makes it possible to provide strong theoretical guarantees on the privacy and utility ofreleased data. While it is well-understood how to release data based on counts and simplefunctions under this guarantee; it remains to provide general purpose techniques to releasedata that is useful for a variety of queries. In this paper; we focus on spatial data such aslocations and more generally any multi-dimensional data that can be indexed by a treestructure. Directly applying existing differential privacy methods to this type of data simplygenerates noise. We propose instead the class of" private spatial decompositions'': theseadapt standard spatial indexing methods such as quad trees and kd-trees to provide aprivate description of the data distribution.

PRUNES: an efficient and complete strategy for automated trust negotiation over the Internet,Ting Yu; Xiaosong Ma; Marianne Winslett,ABSTRACT The Internet provides an environment where two parties; who are virtuallystrangers to each other; can make connections and do business together. Before any actualbusiness starts; a certain level of trust should be established. Each party should make surethat the other one is qualified and can be trusted for the ongoing business. Property-baseddigital credentials 1] make it possible to prove that a party satisfies certain requirementsimposed by the ongoing business. The problem is that digital credentials themselves alsocontain valuable information which a party does not want to show to just any strangers.Therefore; for each credential there is usually a disclosure policy associated with it;indicating under what circumstances this credential can be disclosed. An automated trustnegotiation strategy needs to be adopted to establish trust between two parties based on …,Proceedings of the 7th ACM conference on Computer and communications security,2000,171
Protecting privacy during on-line trust negotiation,Kent E Seamons; Marianne Winslett; Ting Yu; Lina Yu; Ryan Jarvis,Abstract The dramatic growth of services and information on the Internet is accompanied bygrowing concerns over privacy. Trust negotiation is a new approach to establishing trustbetween strangers on the Internet through the bilateral exchange of digital credentials; theon-line analogue to the paper credentials people carry in their wallets today. When acredential contains sensitive information; its disclosure is governed by an access controlpolicy that specifies credentials that must be received before the sensitive credential isdisclosed. This paper identifies the privacy vulnerabilities present in on-line trust negotiationand the approaches that can be taken to eliminate or minimize those vulnerabilities. Thepaper proposes modifications to negotiation strategies to help prevent the inadvertentdisclosure of credential information during online trust negotiation for those credentials or …,International Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,2002,144
On mouse dynamics as a behavioral biometric for authentication,Zach Jorgensen; Ting Yu,Abstract The idea of using one's behavior with a pointing device; such as a mouse or atouchpad; as a behavioral biometric for authentication purposes has gained increasingattention over the past decade. A number of interesting approaches based on the idea haveemerged in the literature and promising experimental results have been reported; however;we argue that limitations in the past experimental evaluations of these approaches raisequestions about their true effectiveness in a practical setting. In this paper; we reviewexisting authentication approaches based on mouse dynamics and shed light on someimportant limitations regarding how the effectiveness of these approaches has beenevaluated in the past.

On the modeling and analysis of obligations,Keith Irwin; Ting Yu; William H Winsborough,Abstract Traditional security policies largely focus on access control requirements; whichspecify who can access what under what circumstances. Besides access controlrequirements; the availability of services in many applications often further imposesobligation requirements; which specify what actions have to be taken by a subject in thefuture as a condition of getting certain privileges at present. However; it is not clear yet whatthe implications of obligation policies are concerning the security goals of a system. In thispaper; we propose a formal metamodel that captures the key aspects of a system that arerelevant to obligation management. We formally investigate the interpretation of securitypolicies from the perspective of obligations; and define secure system states based on theconcept of accountability. We also study the complexity of checking a state's …,Proceedings of the 13th ACM conference on Computer and communications security,2006,118

On the correctness criteria of fine-grained access control in relational databases,Qihua Wang; Ting Yu; Ninghui Li; Jorge Lobo; Elisa Bertino; Keith Irwin; Ji-Won Byun,Abstract Databases are increasingly being used to store information covered byheterogeneous policies; which require support for access control with great flexibility. Thishas led to increasing interest in using fine-grained access control; where different cells in arelation may be governed by different access control rules. Although several proposals havebeen made to support fine-grained access control; there currently does not exist a formalnotion of correctness regarding the query answering procedure. In this paper; we proposesuch a formal notion of correctness in fine-grained database access control; and discusswhy existing approaches fall short in some circumstances. We then propose a labelingapproach for masking unauthorized information and a query evaluation algorithm whichbetter supports fine-grained access control. Finally; we implement our algorithm using …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,100
Compressed accessibility map: Efficient access control for XML,Ting Yu; Laks VS Lakshmanan; Divesh Srivastava; HV Jagadish,This chapter proposes a space-and time-efficient solution to the access control problem foreXtensible Markup Language (XML) data. The solution is based on a novel notion of acompressed accessibility map (CAM); which compactly identifies the XML data items towhich a user has access; by exploiting structural locality of accessibility in tree-structureddata. Transacting business over the Internet using XML is becoming more and more of areality as one moves towards a world of Internet-worked data; with applications requiringaccess to data on the Internet. In this setting; there is a need for much more sophisticatedtypes of access control than is permitted by simple firewalls. XML is widely regarded as apromising means for data representation integration; and exchange.

A framework for identifying compromised nodes in sensor networks,Qing Zhang; Ting Yu; Peng Ning,Sensor networks are often subject to physical attacks. Once a node's cryptographic key iscompromised; an attacker may completely impersonate it; and introduce arbitrary falseinformation into the network. Basic cryptographic security mechanisms are often not effectivein this situation. Most techniques to address this problem focus on detecting and toleratingfalse information introduced by compromised nodes. They cannot pinpoint exactly where thefalse information is introduced and who is responsible for it. We still lack effective techniquesto accurately identify compromised nodes so that they can be excluded from a sensornetwork once and for all. In this paper; we propose an application-independent frameworkfor identifying compromised sensor nodes. The framework provides an appropriateabstraction of application-specific detection mechanisms; and models the unique …,Securecomm and Workshops; 2006,2006,83
A formal semantics for P3P,Ting Yu; Ninghui Li; Annie I Antón,Abstract The Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P); developed by the W3C; provides anXML-based language for websites to encode their data-collection and data-use practices ina machine-readable form. To fully deploy P3P in enterprise information systems and overthe Web; a well-defined semantics for P3P policies is a must; which is lacking in the currentP3P framework. Without a formal semantics; a P3P policy may be semantically inconsistentand may be interpreted and represented differently by different user agents; it is difficult todetermine whether a P3P policy is indeed enforced by an enterprise; and privacy policiesfrom different corporations cannot be formally compared before information exchange. In thispaper; we propose a relational formal semantics for P3P policies; which precisely andintuitively models the relationships between different components of P3P statements (ie …,Proceedings of the 2004 workshop on Secure web service,2004,76
Routing XML queries,Nick Koudas; Michael Rabinovich; Divesh Srivastava; Ting Yu,In file-sharing P2P networks; a fundamental problem is that of identifying databases that arerelevant to user queries. This problem is referred to as the location problem in P2P literature.We propose a scalable solution to the location problem in a data-sharing P2P network;consisting of a network of XML database nodes and XML router nodes; and make thefollowing contributions. We develop the internal organization and routing protocols for theXML router nodes; to enable scalable XPath query and update processing; under the openand the agreement cooperation models between nodes. Since router nodes tend to bememory constrained; we facilitate a space/performance tradeoff by permitting aggregatedrouting states; and developing algorithms for generating and using such aggregatedinformation.

Protecting sensitive labels in social network data anonymization,Mingxuan Yuan; Lei Chen; S Yu Philip; Ting Yu,Privacy is one of the major concerns when publishing or sharing social network data forsocial science research and business analysis. Recently; researchers have developedprivacy models similar to k-anonymity to prevent node reidentification through structureinformation. However; even when these privacy models are enforced; an attacker may stillbe able to infer one's private information if a group of nodes largely share the same sensitivelabels (ie; attributes). In other words; the label-node relationship is not well protected by purestructure anonymization methods. Furthermore; existing approaches; which rely on edgeediting or node clustering; may significantly alter key graph properties. In this paper; wedefine a k-degree-l-diversity anonymity model that considers the protection of structuralinformation as well as sensitive labels of individuals.

A Classification Scheme for Trust Functions in Reputation-Based Trust Management.,Qing Zhang; Ting Yu; Keith Irwin,Abstract. Reputation is an important means to establish trust in decentralized environmentssuch as the Semantic Web. In reputation-based trust management; an entity's reputation isusually built on feedback from those who have direct interactions with the entity. A trustfunction is used to infer one's trustworthiness based on such feedback. Many trust functionshave been proposed in the literature. They are typically designed for specific applicationdomains; thus differ in a variety of aspects; including trust inference methodologies;complexity and accuracy. In this paper; we propose a classification scheme for trustfunctions; which will help the systematic analysis and selection of trust functions forparticular applications.,ISWC Workshop on Trust; Security; and Reputation on the Semantic Web,2004,67
A compressed accessibility map for XML,Ting Yu; Divesh Srivastava; Laks VS Lakshmanan; HV Jagadish,Abstract XML is the undisputed standard for data representation and exchange. Ascompanies transact business over the Internet; letting authorized customers directly access;and even modify; XML data offers many advantages in terms of cost; accuracy; andtimeliness. Given the complex business relationships between companies; and the sensitivenature of information; access must be provided selectively; using sophisticated accesscontrol specifications. Using the specification directly to determine if a user has access to anXML data item can be extremely inefficient. The alternative of fully materializing; for eachdata item; the users authorized to access it can be space-inefficient. In this article; weintroduce a compressed accessibility map (CAM) as a space-and time-efficient solution tothe access control problem for XML data.

Preventing attribute information leakage in automated trust negotiation,Keith Irwin; Ting Yu,Abstract Automated trust negotiation is an approach which establishes trust betweenstrangers through the bilateral; iterative disclosure of digital credentials. Sensitivecredentials are protected by access control policies which may also be communicated to theother party. Ideally; sensitive information should not be known by others unless its accesscontrol policy has been satisfied. However; due to bilateral information exchange;information may flow to others in a variety of forms; many of which cannot be protected byaccess control policies alone. In particular; sensitive information may be inferred byobserving negotiation participants' behavior even when access control policies are strictlyenforced. In this paper; we propose a general framework for the safety of trust negotiationsystems. Compared to the existing safety model; our framework focuses on the actual …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM conference on Computer and communications security,2005,60

Policy migration for sensitive credentials in trust negotiation,Ting Yu; Marianne Winslett,Abstract Trust negotiation is an approach to establishing trust between strangers through thebilateral; iterative disclosure of digital credentials. Under automated trust negotiation; accesscontrol policies are associated with sensitive credentials to control under whatcircumstances those credentials can be disclosed. Ideally; the information in a user'ssensitive credential should not be known by others unless the corresponding policy issatisfied. However; the original model for user interaction in trust negotiation has pitfallswhich can be easily exploited to infer one's private information; even if access controlpolicies are strictly enforced. To preserve one's privacy; a more flexible interaction model fortrust negotiation is required. On the other hand; it is also desirable for two parties to be ableto establish trust whenever possible.

Mining frequent graph patterns with differential privacy,Entong Shen; Ting Yu,Abstract Discovering frequent graph patterns in a graph database offers valuableinformation in a variety of applications. However; if the graph dataset contains sensitive dataof individuals such as mobile phone-call graphs and web-click graphs; releasing discoveredfrequent patterns may present a threat to the privacy of individuals. Differential privacy hasrecently emerged as the de facto standard for private data analysis due to its provableprivacy guarantee. In this paper we propose the first differentially private algorithm for miningfrequent graph patterns. We first show that previous techniques on differentially privatediscovery of frequent itemsets cannot apply in mining frequent graph patterns due to theinherent complexity of handling structural information in graphs.

Defining and measuring policy coverage in testing access control policies,Evan Martin; Tao Xie; Ting Yu,Abstract To facilitate managing access control in a system; security officers increasingly writeaccess control policies in specification languages such as XACML; and use a dedicatedsoftware component called a Policy Decision Point (PDP). To increase confidence on writtenpolicies; certain types of policy testing (often in an ad hoc way) are usually conducted; whichprobe the PDP with some typical requests and check PDP's responses against expectedones. This paper develops a first step toward systematic policy testing by defining andmeasuring policy coverage when testing policies. We have developed a coverage-measurement tool to measure policy coverage given a set of XACML policies and a set ofrequests. We have developed a tool for request generation; which randomly generatesrequests for a given set of policies; and a tool for request reduction; which greedily selects …,International Conference on Information and Communications Security,2006,50

Automated trust establishment in open systems,Ting Yu; Marianne Winslett,To trust an entity means to have firm confidence in the integrity and ability of that entity toperform according to one's expectations [66]. Trust relationships between entities areparticularly important when one entity's action or service may have a great impact on theinterests of others. In this thesis; we study how to establish such trust relationships betweenentities. In particular; we are interested in the establishment of trust relationships betweenservice providers and service requesters in open distributed computing environments. Intraditional distributed environments; service providers and requesters are usually known toeach other. Often shared information in the environment tells which parties can provide whatkind of services and which parties are entitled to make use of those services. Thus; trustbetween parties is a straightforward matter. Even if on some occasions there is a trust …,*,2003,36
How to Exploit Ontologies for Trust Negotiation.,Travis Leithead; Wolfgang Nejdl; Daniel Olmedilla; Kent E Seamons; Marianne Winslett; Ting Yu; Charles C Zhang,Abstract. The World Wide Web makes it easy to share information and resources; but offersfew ways to limit the manner in which these resources are shared. The specification andautomated enforcement of security-related policies offer promise as a way of providingcontrolled sharing; but few tools are available to assist in policy specification andmanagement; especially in an open system such as the Web; where resource providers andusers are often strangers to one another and exact and correct specification of policies willbe crucial.

Conservative or liberal? personalized differential privacy,Zach Jorgensen; Ting Yu; Graham Cormode,Differential privacy is widely accepted as a powerful framework for providing strong; formalprivacy guarantees for aggregate data analysis. A limitation of the model is that the samelevel of privacy protection is afforded for all individuals. However; it is common that the datasubjects have quite different expectations regarding the acceptable level of privacy for theirdata. Consequently; differential privacy may lead to insufficient privacy protection for someusers; while over-protecting others. We argue that by accepting that not all users require thesame level of privacy; a higher level of utility can often be attained by not providing excessprivacy to those who do not want it. We propose a new privacy definition called personalizeddifferential privacy (PDP); a generalization of differential privacy in which users specify apersonal privacy requirement for their data.

A semantics based approach to privacy languages,Ninghui Li; Ting Yu; A Anton,Abstract A key reason for the slow adoption of the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) isthe lack of a formal semantics. Without a formal semantics; a P3P policy may be semanticallyinconsistent and may be interpreted and represented differently by different user agents. Inthis paper; we redress these problems by proposing a relational formal semantics for P3Ppolicies; which precisely models the relationships between different components of P3Pstatements (ie; collected data items; purposes; recipients and retentions) during onlineinformation collection. Based on this semantics; we present SemPref; a simple; efficient andexpressive semantics-based preference language.

Despite much work on this topic; the area has not yet reachedstability. Early models (k-anonymity and ℓ-diversity) are now thought to offer insufficientprivacy.

Towards a dynamic and composable model of trust,Adam J Lee; Ting Yu,Abstract During their everyday decision making; humans consider the interplay between twotypes of trust: vertical trust and horizontal trust. Vertical trust captures the trust relationshipsthat exist between individuals and institutions; while horizontal trust represents the trust thatcan be inferred from the observations and opinions of others. Although researchers areactively exploring both vertical and horizontal trust within the context of distributedcomputing (eg; credential-based trust and reputation-based trust; respectively); thespecification and enforcement of composite trust management policies involving the flexiblecomposition of both types of trust metrics is currently an unexplored area.

Denial of service attacks and defenses in decentralized trust management,Jiangtao Li; Ninghui Li; XiaoFeng Wang; Ting Yu,Abstract Trust management is an approach to scalable and flexible access control indecentralized systems. In trust management; a server often needs to evaluate a chain ofcredentials submitted by a client; this requires the server to perform multiple expensivedigital signature verifications. In this paper; we study low-bandwidth Denial-of-Service (DoS)attacks that exploit the existence of trust management systems to deplete server resources.Although the threat of DoS attacks has been studied for some application-level protocolssuch as authentication protocols; we show that it is especially destructive for trustmanagement systems. Exploiting the delegation feature in trust management languages; anattacker can forge a long credential chain to force a server to consume a large amount ofcomputing resource. Using game theory as an analytic tool; we demonstrate that …,International Journal of Information Security,2009,23
Heavy hitter estimation over set-valued data with local differential privacy,Zhan Qin; Yin Yang; Ting Yu; Issa Khalil; Xiaokui Xiao; Kui Ren,Abstract In local differential privacy (LDP); each user perturbs her data locally beforesending the noisy data to a data collector. The latter then analyzes the data to obtain usefulstatistics. Unlike the setting of centralized differential privacy; in LDP the data collector nevergains access to the exact values of sensitive data; which protects not only the privacy of datacontributors but also the collector itself against the risk of potential data leakage. ExistingLDP solutions in the literature are mostly limited to the case that each user possesses atuple of numeric or categorical values; and the data collector computes basic statistics suchas counts or mean values. To the best of our knowledge; no existing work tackles morecomplex data mining tasks such as heavy hitter discovery over set-valued data. In this paper;we present a systematic study of heavy hitter mining under LDP. We first review existing …,Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2016,21
Towards secure dataflow processing in open distributed systems,Juan Du; Wei Wei; Xiaohui Gu; Ting Yu,Abstract Open distributed systems such as service oriented architecture and cloudcomputing have emerged as promising platforms to deliver software as a service to users.However; for many security sensitive applications such as critical data processing; trustmanagement poses significant challenges for migrating those critical applications into opendistributed systems. In this paper; we present the design and implementation of a newsecure dataflow processing system that aims at providing trustworthy continuous dataprocessing in multi-party open distributed systems. We identify a set of major security attacksthat can compromise the integrity of dataflow processing and provide effective protectionmechanisms to counter those attacks. We have implemented a prototype of the securedataflow processing framework and tested it on the PlanetLab testbed.

EMFS: Email-based personal cloud storage,Jagan Srinivasan; Wei Wei; Xiaosong Ma; Ting Yu,Though a variety of cloud storage services have been offered recently; they have not yetprovided users with transparent and cost-effective personal data storage. Services likeGoogle Docs offer easy file access and sharing; but tie storage with internal data formatsand specific applications. Meanwhile; services like Drop box offer general-purpose storage.Yet they have not been widely utilized; partly due to their fee-charging nature and long-termservice availability concerns. Web-based email services; on the other hand; have beenoffering growing email storage capacity; reliable service; and powerful search capability;making them appealing as storage resources. In this paper; we examine the efficacy ofleveraging web-based email services to build a personal storage cloud.

On the management of user obligations,Murillo Pontual; Omar Chowdhury; William H Winsborough; Ting Yu; Keith Irwin,Abstract This paper is part of a project investigating authorization systems that assignobligations to users. We are particularly interested in obligations that require authorization tobe performed and that; when performed; may modify the authorization state. In this context; auser may incur an obligation she is unauthorized to perform. Prior work has introduced aproperty of the authorization system state that ensures users will be authorized to fulfill theirobligations. We call this property accountability because users that fail to perform authorizedobligations are accountable for their non-performance. While a reference monitor canmitigate violations of accountability; it cannot prevent them entirely. This paper presentstechniques to be used by obligation system managers to restore accountability. Weintroduce several notions of dependence among pending obligations that must be …,Proceedings of the 16th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2011,19
Secure data management in decentralized systems,Ting Yu; Sushil Jajodia,Database security is one of the classical topics in the research of information systemsecurity. Ever since the early years of database management systems; a great deal ofresearch activity has been conducted. Fruitful results have been produced; many of whichare widely adopted in commercial and military database management systems. In recentyears; the research scope of database security has been greatly expanded due to the rapiddevelopment of the global internetworked infrastructure. Databases are no longer stand-alone systems that are only accessible to internal users of-ganizations. Instead; allowingselective access from different security domains has become a must for many businesspractices. Many of the assumptions and problems in traditional databases need to berevisited and readdressed in decentralized en-ronments. Further; the Internet and the …,*,2007,19
Method and apparatus for providing anonymization of data,*,A method and apparatus for providing an anonymization of data are disclosed. For example;the method receives a request for anonymizing; wherein the request comprises a bipartitegraph for a plurality of associations or a table that encodes the plurality of associations forthe bipartite graph. The method places each node in the bipartite graph in a safe group andprovides an anonymized graph that encodes the plurality of associations of the bipartitegraph; if a safe group for all nodes of the bipartite graph is found.,*,2013,18
An identifiability-based access control model for privacy protection in open systems,Keith Irwin; Ting Yu,Abstract We argue that in open systems one's private information disclosure needs to bedynamically controlled based on both its sensitivity and the possibility that a user's identity isrevealed. Then we propose an identifiability-based access control scheme; which not onlyproperly control usrers' private information; but also increase users' access to web services.,Proceedings of the 2004 ACM workshop on Privacy in the electronic society,2004,18
A Privacy-Preserving Framework for Personalized; Social Recommendations.,Zach Jorgensen; Ting Yu,ABSTRACT We consider the problem of producing item recommendations that arepersonalized based on a user's social network; while simultaneously preventing thedisclosure of sensitive user-item preferences (eg; product purchases; ad clicks; webbrowsing history; etc.). Our main contribution is a privacypreserving framework for a class ofsocial recommendation algorithms that provides strong; formal privacy guarantees under themodel of differential privacy. Existing mechanisms for achieving differential privacy lead toan unacceptable loss of utility when applied to the social recommendation problem. Toaddress this; the proposed framework incorporates a clustering procedure that groups usersaccording to the natural community structure of the social network and significantly reducesthe amount of noise required to satisfy differential privacy. Although this reduction in noise …,EDBT,2014,17
Defending multiple-user-multiple-target attacks in online reputation systems,Yuhong Liu; Yan Sun; Ting Yu,As online reputation systems are playing increasingly important roles in reducing risks ofonline interactions; attacks against such systems have evolved rapidly. Nowadays; somepowerful attacks are conducted by companies that make profit through manipulatingreputation of online items for their customers. These items can be products (eg in Amazon);businesses (eg hotels in travel sites); and digital content (eg videos in You tube). In suchattacks; colluded malicious users play well-planned strategies to manipulate reputation ofmultiple target items. To address these attacks; we propose a defense scheme that (1) setsup heterogeneous thresholds for detecting suspicious items and (2) identifies target itemsbased on correlation analysis among suspicious items. The proposed scheme and two othercomparison schemes are evaluated by a combination of real user data and simulation …,Privacy; Security; Risk and Trust (PASSAT) and 2011 IEEE Third Inernational Conference on Social Computing (SocialCom); 2011 IEEE Third International Conference on,2011,17
Enforcing security properties in task-based systems,Keith Irwin; Ting Yu; William H Winsborough,Abstract Though a user's privileges are often granted based on the tasks that the user isexpected to fulfill; the concept of tasks is usually not explicitly modeled in access control. Wepropose a system where tasks are the central concept that associates users to privileges.Ideally a user should be able to utilize these privileges and fulfill his tasks; but not to takeharmful actions. To ensure this; a system often specifies a high-level security property torestrict the sequence of actions that a user can perform. In this paper; we propose a generalmodel of access control in task-based system. This model considers the permissions a useras well as their temporal availability. Based on this model; we investigate the problem ofenforcing security properties both statically (ie; when tasks are assigned) and dynamically(ie; when actions are performed). We study the complexity of static enforcement; and …,Proceedings of the 13th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2008,17
On the modeling of honest players in reputation systems,Qing Zhang; Wei Wei; Ting Yu,Abstract Reputation mechanisms are a key technique to trust assessment in large-scaledecentralized systems. The effectiveness of reputation-based trust managementfundamentally relies on the assumption that an entity's future behavior may be predictedbased on its past behavior. Though many reputation-based trust schemes have beenproposed; they can often be easily manipulated and exploited; since an attacker may adaptits behavior; and make the above assumption invalid. In other words; existing trust schemesare in general only effective when applied to honest players who usually act with certainconsistency instead of adversaries who can behave arbitrarily. In this paper; we investigatethe modeling of honest entities in decentralized systems. We build a statistical model for thetransaction histories of honest players. This statistical model serves as a profiling tool to …,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2009,16
Detecting opinion spammer groups through community discovery and sentiment analysis,Euijin Choo; Ting Yu; Min Chi,Abstract In this paper we investigate on detection of opinion spammer groups in reviewsystems. Most existing approaches typically build pure content-based classifiers; usingvarious features extracted from review contents; however; spammers can superficially altertheir review contents to avoid detections. In our approach; we focus on user relationshipsbuilt through interactions to identify spammers. Previously; we revealed the existence ofimplicit communities among users based upon their interaction patterns [3]. In this work wefurther explore the community structures to distinguish spam communities from non-spamones with sentiment analysis on user interactions. Through extensive experiments over adataset collected from Amazon; we found that the discovered strong positive communitiesare more likely to be opinion spammer groups. In fact; our results show that our approach …,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2015,15
Scalable distributed service integrity attestation for Software-as-a-Service clouds,Juan Du; Daniel J Dean; Yongmin Tan; Xiaohui Gu; Ting Yu,Software-as-a-service (SaaS) cloud systems enable application service providers to delivertheir applications via massive cloud computing infrastructures. However; due to their sharingnature; SaaS clouds are vulnerable to malicious attacks. In this paper; we present IntTest; ascalable and effective service integrity attestation framework for SaaS clouds. IntTestprovides a novel integrated attestation graph analysis scheme that can provide strongerattacker pinpointing power than previous schemes. Moreover; IntTest can automaticallyenhance result quality by replacing bad results produced by malicious attackers with goodresults produced by benign service providers. We have implemented a prototype of theIntTest system and tested it on a production cloud computing infrastructure using IBMSystem S stream processing applications.

Don’t reveal my intension: Protecting user privacy using declarative preferences during distributed query processing,Nicholas L Farnan; Adam J Lee; Panos K Chrysanthis; Ting Yu,Abstract In a centralized setting; the declarative nature of SQL is a major strength: a user cansimply describe what she wants to retrieve; and need not worry about how the resultingquery plan is actually generated and executed. However; in a decentralized setting; twoquery plans that produce the same result might actually reveal vastly different informationabout the intensional description of a user's query to the servers participating its evaluation.In cases where a user considers portions of her query to be sensitive; this is clearlyproblematic. In this paper; we address the specification and enforcement of querier privacyconstraints on the execution of distributed database queries. We formalize a notion ofintensional query privacy called (I; A)-privacy; and extend the syntax of SQL to allow users toenforce strict (I; A)-privacy constraints or partially ordered privacy/performance …,European Symposium on Research in Computer Security,2011,14
Distribution based microdata anonymization,Nick Koudas; Divesh Srivastava; Ting Yu; Qing Zhang,Abstract Before sharing to support ad hoc aggregate analyses; microdata often need to beanonymized to protect the privacy of individuals. A variety of privacy models have beenproposed for microdata anonymization. Many of these models (eg; t-closeness) essentiallyrequire that; after anonymization; groups of sensitive attribute values follow specifieddistributions. To support such models; in this paper we study the problem of transforming agroup of sensitive attribute values to follow a certain target distribution with minimal datadistortion. Specifically; we develop and evaluate a novel methodology that combines the useof sensitive attribute permutation and generalization with the addition of fake sensitiveattribute values to achieve this transformation. We identify metrics related to accuracy ofaggregate query answers over the transformed data; and develop efficient anonymization …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,14
Determining user privacy preferences by asking the right questions: an automated approach,Keith Irwin; Ting Yu,Abstract One fundamental aspect of user privacy is to respect the privacy preferences thatusers have. A clear prerequisite to doing this is accurately gauging what user's privacypreferences are. Current approaches either offer limited privacy options or have so manychoices that users are likely to be overwhelmed. We present a framework for modeling userprivacy preferences in terms of a hierarchy of questions which can be asked. We describetwo means of dynamically choosing which questions should be asked to efficientlydetermine what a user's privacy preferences are.,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM workshop on Privacy in the electronic society,2005,14
Automated trust negotiation over the internet,Ting Yu; Marianne Winslett; KE Seamons,Abstract The Internet provides an environment where two parties; who are virtually strangersto each other; can make connections and do business together. Before any actual businessstarts; a certain level of trust should be established. Each party should make sure that theother one is qualified and can be trusted for the ongoing transaction. Automated trustnegotiation is a new approach to establishing trust between strangers through the exchangeof digital credentials and the use of access control policies that specify what combinations ofcredentials a stranger must disclose in order to gain access to each local service orcredential. In this paper; we give an overview of automated trust negotiation; including thearchitecture of automated trust negotiation; trust negotiation protocols and negotiationstrategies. Then we briefly discuss various issues in automated trust negotiation; such as …,Proc. of Multiconference on Systemics; Cybernetics and Informatics,2002,14
Assigning responsibility for failed obligations,Keith Irwin; Ting Yu; William H Winsborough,Traditional security policies largely focus on access control. Though essential; accesscontrol is only one aspect of security. In particular; the correct behavior and reliableoperation of a system depends not only on what users are permitted to do; but oftentimes onwhat users are required to do. Such obligatory actions are integral to the security proceduresof many enterprises. Unlike access control; obligations assigned to individual users areoften unenforceable; that is; the system cannot ensure that each obligation will be fulfilled.Accurately determining who was at fault when obligations are not met is essential forresponding appropriately; be it in terms of modified trust relationships or other recourse. Inthis paper; based on a formal metamodel of obligations; we propose an approach for faultassessment through active online tracking of responsibilities and dependencies between …,IFIP International Conference on Trust Management,2008,12
iBigTable: practical data integrity for bigtable in public cloud,Wei Wei; Ting Yu; Rui Xue,Abstract BigTable is a distributed storage system that is designed to manage large-scalestructured data. Deploying BigTable in a public cloud is an economic storage solution tosmall businesses and researchers who need to deal with data processing tasks over largeamount of data but often lack capabilities to obtain their own powerful clusters. As one maynot always trust the public cloud provider; one important security issue is to ensure theintegrity of data managed by BigTable running at the cloud. In this paper; we presentiBigTable; an enhancement of BigTable that provides scalable data integrity assurance.

VRank: A context-aware approach to vulnerability scoring and ranking in SOA,Jianchun Jiang; Liping Ding; Ennan Zhai; Ting Yu,With the rapid adoption of the concepts of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA); sophisticatedbusiness processes and tasks are increasingly realized through composing distributedsoftware components offered by different providers. Though such practices offer advantagesin terms of cost-effectiveness and flexibility; those components are not immune tovulnerabilities. It is therefore important for the administrator of some composed service toevaluate the threats of such vulnerabilities accordingly within limited available information.Since almost all the existing efforts (eg; CVSS) fail to consider specific context-awareinformation which is the specific character of SOA; they could not be adopted into SOA forscoring vulnerabilities. In this paper; we present VRank; a novel framework for the scoringand ranking of vulnerabilities in SOA. Different from existing efforts; for a given …,Software Security and Reliability (SERE); 2012 IEEE Sixth International Conference on,2012,11
On verifying stateful dataflow processing services in large-scale cloud systems,Juan Du; Xiaohui Gu; Ting Yu,Abstract Cloud computing needs to provide integrity assurance in order to support securitysensitive application services such as critical dataflow processing. In this paper; we presenta novel RObust Service Integrity Attestation (ROSIA) framework that can efficiently verify theintegrity of stateful dataflow processing services and pinpoint malicious service providerswithin a large-scale cloud system. ROSIA achieves robustness by supporting statefuldataflow services such as windowed stream operators; and performing integratedconsistency check to detect colluding attacks. We have implemented ROSIA on top of theIBM System S dataflow processing system and tested it on the NCSU virtual computing lab.Our experimental results show that our scheme is feasible and efficient for large-scale cloudsystems.,Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Computer and communications security,2010,11
Investigating privacy-aware distributed query evaluation,Nicholas L Farnan; Adam J Lee; Ting Yu,Abstract Historically; privacy and efficiency have largely been at odds with one anotherwhen querying remote data sources: traditional query optimization techniques provideefficient retrieval by exporting information about the intension of a query to data sources;while private information retrieval (PIR) schemes hide query intension at the cost of extremecomputational or communication overheads. Given the increasing use of Internet-scaledistributed databases; exploring the spectrum between these two extremes is worthwhile. Inthis paper; we explore the degree to which query intension is leaked to remote data sourceswhen a variety of existing query processing and view materialization techniques are used.We show that these information flows can be quantified in a concrete manner; andinvestigate the notion of privacy-aware distributed query evaluation. We then propose two …,Proceedings of the 9th Annual ACM Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society,2010,10
Toward practical authorization-dependent user obligation systems,Murillo Pontual; Omar Chowdhury; William H Winsborough; Ting Yu; Keith Irwin,Abstract Many authorization system models include some notion of obligation. Little attentionhas been given to user obligations that depend on and affect authorizations. However; to beusable; the system must ensure users have the authorizations they need when theirobligations must be performed. Prior work in this area introduced accountability propertiesthat ensure failure to fulfill obligations is not due to lack of required authorizations. That workpresented inconclusive and purely theoretical results concerning the feasibility ofmaintaining accountability in practice. The results of the current paper include algorithmsand performance analysis that support the thesis that maintaining accountability in areference monitor is reasonable in many applications.,Proceedings of the 5th ACM Symposium on Information; Computer and Communications Security,2010,10
Security policy testing via automated program code generation,Ting Yu; Dhivya Sivasubramanian; Tao Xie,Abstract Access control is one of the fundamental security mechanisms for informationsystems. It determines the availability of resources to principals; operations that can beperformed; and under what circumstances. Traditionally the enforcement of access control isoften hardcoded in applications or systems; such hardcoding makes it hard to verify thecorrectness of access control and to accommodate changes of security requirements.Recently; access control policies have been increasingly separated from enforcementmechanisms. An access control policy is explicitly specified using certain policy languageswith well-defined syntax and semantics. An application then consults the policy duringruntime to determine whether an access request from a principal should be allowed ordenied. There are two main advantages of this approach. First; security officers can now …,Proceedings of the 5th Annual Workshop on Cyber Security and Information Intelligence Research: Cyber Security and Information Intelligence Challenges and Strategies,2009,10
Discovering malicious domains through passive DNS data graph analysis,Issa Khalil; Ting Yu; Bei Guan,Abstract Malicious domains are key components to a variety of cyber attacks. Several recenttechniques are proposed to identify malicious domains through analysis of DNS data. Thegeneral approach is to build classifiers based on DNS-related local domain features. Onepotential problem is that many local features; eg; domain name patterns and temporalpatterns; tend to be not robust. Attackers could easily alter these features to evade detectionwithout affecting much their attack capabilities. In this paper; we take a complementaryapproach. Instead of focusing on local features; we propose to discover and analyze globalassociations among domains. The key challenges are (1) to build meaningful associationsamong domains; and (2) to use these associations to reason about the potentialmaliciousness of domains. For the first challenge; we take advantage of the modus …,Proceedings of the 11th ACM on Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2016,8
PAQO: Preference-aware query optimization for decentralized database systems,Nicholas L Farnan; Adam J Lee; Panos K Chrysanthis; Ting Yu,The declarative nature of SQL has traditionally been a major strength. Users simply statewhat information they are interested in; and the database management system determinesthe best plan for retrieving it. A consequence of this model is that should a user ever want tospecify some aspect of how their queries are evaluated (eg; a preference to read data from aspecific replica; or a requirement for all joins to be performed by a single server); they areunable to. This can leave database administrators shoehorning evaluation preferences intodatabase cost models. Further; for distributed database users; it can result in queryevaluation plans that violate data handling best practices or the privacy of the user. Toaddress such issues; we have developed a framework for declarative; user-specifiedconstraints on the query optimization process and implemented it within PosgreSQL.

Publishing attributed social graphs with formal privacy guarantees,Zach Jorgensen; Ting Yu; Graham Cormode,Abstract Many data analysis tasks rely on the abstraction of a graph to represent relationsbetween entities; with attributes on the nodes and edges. Since the relationships encodedare often sensitive; we seek effective ways to release representative graphs whichnevertheless protect the privacy of the data subjects. Prior work on this topic has focusedprimarily on the graph structure in isolation; and has not provided ways to handle richergraphs with correlated attributes. We introduce an approach to release such graphs underthe strong guarantee of differential privacy. We adapt existing graph models; and introduce anew one; and show how to augment them with meaningful privacy. This provides a completeworkflow; where the input is a sensitive graph; and the output is a realistic synthetic graph.Our experimental study demonstrates that our process produces useful; accurate …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,7
Revealing and incorporating implicit communities to improve recommender systems,Euijin Choo; Ting Yu; Min Chi; Yan Sun,Abstract Social connections often have a significant influence on personal decision making.Researchers have proposed novel recommender systems that take advantage of socialrelationship information to improve recommendations. These systems; while promising; areoften hindered in practice. Existing social networks such as Facebook are not designed forrecommendations and thus contain many irrelevant relationships. Many recommendationplatforms such as Amazon often do not permit users to establish explicit social relationships.And direct integration of social and commercial systems raises privacy concerns. In thispaper we address these issues by focusing on the extraction of implicit and relevantrelationships among users based upon the patterns of their existing interactions. Our work isgrounded in the context of item recommendations on Amazon. We investigate whether …,Proceedings of the fifteenth ACM conference on Economics and computation,2014,7
Aggregate query answering on possibilistic data with cardinality constraints,Graham Cormode; Divesh Srivastava; Entong Shen; Ting Yu,Uncertainties in data can arise for a number of reasons: when data is incomplete; containsconflicting information or has been deliberately perturbed or coarsened to remove sensitivedetails. An important case which arises in many real applications is when the data describesa set of possibilities; but with cardinality constraints. These constraints represent correlationsbetween tuples encoding; eg that at most two possible records are correct; or that there is an(unknown) one-to-one mapping between a set of tuples and attribute values. Although therehas been much effort to handle uncertain data; current systems are not equipped to handlesuch correlations; beyond simple mutual exclusion and co-existence constraints. Vitally; theyhave little support for efficiently handling aggregate queries on such data.

Automated trust negotiation in open systems,Adam J Lee; Kent E Seamons; Marianne Winslett; Ting Yu,Abstract To trust an entity means to have strong confidence in the integrity and ability of thatentity to perform according to one's expections [24]. Trust relationships between entities areparticularly important when one entity's action or service may have a great impact on theinterests of others. In this chapter; we study how to establish such trust relationshipsbetween entities. In particular; we are interested in the establishment of trust relationshipsbetween service providers and service requesters in open distributed computingenvironments.,*,2007,7
Trust negotiation in dynamic coalitions,Kent E Seamons; Marianne Winslett; Ting Yu; Thomas Chan; Evan Child; Michael Halcrow; Adam Hess; Jason Holt; Jared Jacobson; Ryan Jarvis; Bryan Smith; Tore Sundelin; Lina Yu,Military and business partners may need to conduct sensitive interactions on line; requiringmembers in a coalition to share sensitive resources with those outside their local securitydomain. Automated trust negotiation is an approach that accomplishes this; through the useof access control policies that specify what combinations of digital credentials a strangermust disclose to gain access to a coalition resource. The Trust Negotiation in DynamicCoalitions project has focused on the theoretical underpinnings of trust negotiation as wellas the design and implementation of TrustBuilder; an architecture that incorporates trustnegotiation into standard network technologies.

Effective trust management through a hybrid logical and relational approach,Adam J Lee; Ting Yu; Yann Le Gall,Abstract Despite a plethora of recent research regarding trust management approaches toauthorization; relatively little attention has been given to exactly how these technologies canbe effectively deployed. In this paper; we investigate one way in which well-establishedlogical trust management systems described in the literature can be deployed withinenterprise environments. Specifically; we develop a framework within which logical trustmanagement policies can be managed using a relational DBMS. We describe a correct andcomplete procedure for compiling CTM credentials into dynamic views within a database;and show how the resulting system can be used to perform role membership checks or toenumerate the members of a given role. We then propose a hybrid algorithm that leveragesthe logical ruleset and the underlying DBMS to efficiently enumerate the capabilities …,Proceedings of the 5th ACM Symposium on Information; Computer and Communications Security,2010,6
Line digraph iterations and diameter vulnerability,Feng Cao; Ding-Zhu Du; Shitou Han; Dongsoo Kim; Ting Yu,Many interconnection networks can be constructed with line digraph it- erations; such as de Bruijndigraphs [2]; Kautz digraphs [12]; generalized de Bruijn digraphs [5;13]; Imase-Itoh digraphs[10]; large bipartite digraphs [15]; and large generalized cycles [7]. One may study the propertiesof those net- works by taking advantage of line digraph iterations. However; this should be donewith caution. In fact; some argument that works for line graph iteration may not work for line digraphiteration. For example; the line graph of a graph which has d edge-disjoint paths of length atmost l between any two vertices must have d vertex-disjoint paths of length at most l+ 1 betweenany two vertices. The proof is quite simple. For any two different vertices u and v in the line graphL(G); consider the corresponding edges (xu;yu) and (xv;yv) in the original graph G.

Dynamic and Efficient Private Keyword Search over Inverted Index--Based Encrypted Data,Rui Zhang; Rui Xue; Ting Yu; Ling Liu,Abstract Querying over encrypted data is gaining increasing popularity in cloud-based datahosting services. Security and efficiency are recognized as two important and yet conflictingrequirements for querying over encrypted data. In this article; we propose an efficient privatekeyword search (EPKS) scheme that supports binary search and extend it to dynamicsettings (called DEPKS) for inverted index--based encrypted data. First; we describe ourapproaches of constructing a searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) scheme that supportsbinary search. Second; we present a novel framework for EPKS and provide its formalsecurity definitions in terms of plaintext privacy and predicate privacy by modifying Shen etal.'s security notions [Shen et al. 2009]. Third; built on the proposed framework; we designan EPKS scheme whose complexity is logarithmic in the number of keywords. The …,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT),2016,5
Wavecluster with differential privacy,Ling Chen; Ting Yu; Rada Chirkova,Abstract WaveCluster is an important family of grid-based clustering algorithms that arecapable of finding clusters of arbitrary shapes. In this paper; we investigate techniques toperform WaveCluster while ensuring differential privacy. Our goal is to develop a generaltechnique for achieving differential privacy on WaveCluster that accommodates differentwavelet transforms. We show that straightforward techniques based on synthetic datageneration and introduction of random noise when quantizing the data; though generallypreserving the distribution of data; often introduce too much noise to preserve usefulclusters. We then propose two optimized techniques; PrivTHR and PrivTHR em; which cansignificantly reduce data distortion during two key steps of WaveCluster: the quantizationstep and the significant grid identification step.

PAQO: a preference-aware query optimizer for PostgreSQL,Nicholas L Farnan; Adam J Lee; Panos K Chrysanthis; Ting Yu,Abstract Although the declarative nature of SQL provides great utility to database users; itsuse in distributed database management systems can leave users unaware of which serversin the system are evaluating portions of their queries. By allowing users to merely say whatdata they are interested in accessing without providing guidance regarding how to retrieve it;query optimizers can generate plans with unintended consequences to the user (eg;violating user privacy by revealing sensitive portions of a user's query to untrusted servers;or impacting result freshness by pulling data from stale data stores). To address these typesof issues; we have created a framework that empowers users with the ability to specifyconstraints on the kinds of plans that can be produced by the optimizer to evaluate theirqueries. Such constraints are specified through an extended version of SQL that we have …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,5
Bounding trust in reputation systems with incomplete information,Xi Gong; Ting Yu; Adam J Lee,Abstract Reputation mechanisms represent a major class of techniques for managing trust indecentralized systems. Quite a few reputation-based trust functions have been proposed inthe literature for use in many different application domains. However; in many situations; onecannot always obtain all of the information required by the trust evaluation process. Forexample; access control restrictions or high collection costs might limit one's ability to gatherevery possible feedback that could be aggregated. Thus; one key question is how toanalytically quantify the quality of reputation scores computed using incomplete information.In this paper; we start a first effort towards answering the above question by studying thefollowing problem: given the existence of certain missing information; what are the worst andbest trust scores (ie; the bounds of trust) a target entity can be assigned by a given …,Proceedings of the second ACM conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy,2012,5
Pvsae: A public verifiable searchable encryption service framework for outsourced encrypted data,Rui Zhang; Rui Xue; Ting Yu; Ling Liu,Outsource encrypted data is a popular trend for storing sensitive data in third party clouds.Many cloud applications need privacy preserving data encryption services with twocapabilities: On one hand; they need querying over encrypted data in Web based datahosting services. On the other hand; they also need to keep the query keywords andassociated search operations private such that data hosting service providers cannot gainaccess to unauthorized content or trace and infer sensitive data stored in the third party datahosting servers. In this paper we present a novel service oriented framework for verifiablesearchable asymmetric encryption; called PVSAE. PVSAE offers strong support foroutsourced encrypted data with two formal security properties in terms of IND-CKA securityand search pattern privacy. Our framework supports two concrete PVSAE schemes.

Ensuring authorization privileges for cascading user obligations,Omar Chowdhury; Murillo Pontual; William H Winsborough; Ting Yu; Keith Irwin; Jianwei Niu,Abstract User obligations are actions that the human users are required to perform in somefuture time. These are common in many practical access control and privacy and candepend on and affect the authorization state. Consequently; a user can incur an obligationthat she is not authorized to perform which may hamper the usability of a system. To mitigatethis problem; previous work introduced a property of the authorization state; accountability;which requires that all the obligatory actions to be authorized when they are attempted.Although; existing work provides a specific and tractable decision procedure for a variationof the accountability property; it makes a simplified assumption that no cascading obligationsmay happen; ie; obligatory actions cannot further incur obligations. This is a strongassumption which reduces the expressive power of past models; and thus cannot support …,Proceedings of the 17th ACM symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies,2012,3
Enhancing personalized ranking quality through multidimensional modeling of inter-item competition,Qinyuan Feng; Ling Liu; Yan Sun; Ting Yu; Yafei Dai,This paper presents MAPS—a personalized Multi-Attribute Probabilistic Selection framework—to estimate the probability of an item being a user's best choice and rank the itemsaccordingly. The MAPS framework makes three original contributions in this paper. First; wecapture the inter-attribute tradeoff by a visual angle model which maps multi-attribute itemsinto points (stars) in a multidimensional space (sky). Second; we model the inter-itemcompetition using the dominating areas of the stars. Third; we capture the user's personalpreferences by a density function learned from his/her history. The MAPS frameworkcarefully combines all three factors to estimate the probability of an item being a user's bestchoice; and produces a personalized ranking accordingly. We evaluate the accuracy ofMAPS through extensive simulations. The results show that MAPS significantly …,Collaborative Computing: Networking; Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom); 2010 6th International Conference on,2010,3
The design and enforcement of a rule-based constraint policy language for service composition,Wei Wei; Ting Yu,Service composition is a new paradigm for efficient and cost-effective IT service provisioningover the network. To safely and effectively deploy composed services within an organizationor among multiple domains; one must be able to specify and enforce a variety of constraintssuch as those derived from legal regulations; Quality of Service (QoS) requirements andprivacy and security policies. In this paper; we show through concrete examples thatconstraints involving topologies are common for composed services but are rarely supportedby existing service composition policy languages. We then present a rule-based constraintpolicy language built on top of a general graph-based service composition model. Thelanguage provides a unified treatment to support both attribute-based and topology-basedconstraints. We further design an ontology-based policy framework for effective policy …,Social Computing (SocialCom); 2010 IEEE Second International Conference on,2010,3
Towards quantitative analysis of proofs of authorization: applications; framework; and techniques,Adam J Lee; Ting Yu,Although policy compliance testing is generally treated as a binary decision problem; theevidence gathered during the trust management process can actually be used to examinethese outcomes within a more continuous space. In this paper; we develop a formal modelthat allows us to quantitatively reason about the outcomes of the policy enforcement processin both absolute (ie; user to ideal case) and relative (ie; user to user) terms. Within thisframework; it becomes possible to quantify; eg; the robustness of a user's proof ofauthorization to possible perturbations in the system; how close an unauthorized user is tosatisfying a particular policy; and relative “top-k” style rankings of the best users to carry outa particular task. To this end; we explore several interesting classes of scoring functions forassessing the robustness of authorization decisions; and develop criteria under which …,Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF); 2010 23rd IEEE,2010,3

Interactive preference-aware query optimization,NR Ong; SE Rojcewicz; Nicholas L Farnan; Adam J Lee; Panos K Chrysanthis; Ting Yu,PASQL is an extension to SQL that allows users of a distributed database to specify privacyconstraints on an SQL query evaluation plan. However; privacy constraints can be difficultfor users to specify; and worse yet; all possible situations that could lead to a privacyviolation may not be known to the user a priori. To address these challenges; we propose aGUI-based interactive process for detecting such violations and generating appropriateconstraints. In this work; we demonstrate two approaches to implementing such a GUI thatprovide different ways of analyzing and interactively optimizing a PASQL query plan.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,2
Integrity Assurance for Outsourced Databases without DBMS Modification,Wei Wei; Ting Yu,Abstract Database outsourcing has become increasingly popular as a cost-effective solutionto provide database services to clients.

Failure feedback for user obligation systems,Murillo Pontual; Keith Irwin; Omar Chowdhury; William H Winsborough; Ting Yu,In recent years; several researchers have proposed techniques for providing users withassistance in understanding and overcoming authorization denials. The incorporation ofenvironmental factors into authorization decisions has made this particularly important andchallenging. An environmental factor that has not previously been considered in this effort toprovide such assistance to users arises in systems where obligations can depend on andaffect authorizations. In these systems; it is desirable to ensure that users will have theauthorizations they require to fulfill their obligations; and prior work has proposed denyingrequests to perform non-obligatory actions that would cause this property to becomeviolated; whether the violation is a direct result of the requested action or due to obligationsthat would be incurred as a result of it.

A Timed Logic for Modeling and Reasoning about Security Protocols.,Xinfeng Lei; Rui Xue; Ting Yu,Researches on analyzing security protocols in recent years witness a switching from anabstract manner to a detailed manner. An abstract method is usually considered simple andeasy-to-use; but some details may be neglected; which may lead to its inconstancy onanalyzing protocols. For example; when explicit time variables are ignored; it is difficult tomodel a time dependent property. The necessity of time variables in specifying a protocol isshown in the following two scenarios. Firstly; When specifying a protocol in which an actionis “an agent j send a message m to an agent i”; it is common that a formula φ is used to statethat an agent i holds a message m. It could be false before occurrence of the receivingaction and true after then. It seems that something like¬ ϕ and ϕ are both true in the logic;which makes the inconsistent.

Avoiding information leakage in security-policy-aware planning,Keith Irwin; Ting Yu; William H Winsborough,Abstract In early computer systems only simple actions would be governed by securitypolicies. However; computers are increasingly handling complex organizational tasks whichmay have complex preconditions and postconditions. As such; it is useful to be able to planand schedule actions in advance in order to ensure that desired actions will be able to becarried out without violating the security policy. However; there is a possibility that planningsystems could accidentally leak information about future plans which should be keptconfidential. In this paper; we investigate how sensitive information could be leaked by aplanning system which uses security policies to ensure that planned actions will be able tooccur. We formally define information leakage in this context. Then we present twotechniques which can be used to mitigate or eliminate this information leakage and prove …,Proceedings of the 7th ACM workshop on Privacy in the electronic society,2008,2

DPCode: privacy-preserving frequent visual patterns publication on cloud,Zhan Qin; Kui Ren; Ting Yu; Jian Weng,Nowadays; cloud has become a promising multimedia data processing and sharingplatform. Many institutes and companies plan to outsource and share their large-scale videoand image datasets on cloud for scientific research and public interest. Among various videoapplications; the discovery of frequent visual patterns over graphical data is an exploratoryand important technique. However; the privacy concerns over the leakage of sensitiveinformation contained in the videos/images impedes the further implementation. Althoughthe frequent visual patterns mining (FVPM) algorithm aggregates summary over individualframes and seems not to pose privacy threat; the private information contained in individualframes still may be leaked from the statistical result.

Exact detection of information leakage in database access control,Farid Alborzi; Rada Chirkova; Ting Yu,Abstract Elaborate security policies often require organizations to restrict user data access ina fine-grained manner; instead of traditional table-or column-level access control. Notsurprisingly; managing fine-grained access control in software is rather challenging. Inparticular; if access is not configured carefully; information leakage may happen: Users mayinfer sensitive information through the data explicitly accessible to them in centralizedsystems or in the cloud. In this paper we formalize this information-leakage problem; bymodeling sensitive information as answers to “secret queries;” and by modeling access-control rules as views. We focus on the scenario where sensitive information can bedeterministically derived by adversaries. We review a natural data-exchange basedinference model for detecting information leakage; and show its capabilities and limitation …,International Conference on Big Data Analytics and Knowledge Discovery,2015,1
COMPARS: toward an empirical approach for comparing the resilience of reputation systems,Euijin Choo; Jianchun Jiang; Ting Yu,Abstract Reputation is a primary mechanism for trust management in decentralized systems.Many reputation-based trust functions have been proposed in the literature. However;picking the right trust function for a given decentralized system is a non-trivial task. One hasto consider and balance a variety of factors; including computation and communicationcosts; scalability and resilience to manipulations by attackers. Although the former two arerelatively easy to evaluate; the evaluation of resilience of trust functions is challenging. Mostexisting work bases evaluation on static attack models; which is unrealistic as it fails toreflect the adaptive nature of adversaries (who are often real human users rather thansimple computing agents). In this paper; we highlight the importance of the modeling ofadaptive attackers when evaluating reputation-based trust functions; and propose an …,Proceedings of the 4th ACM conference on Data and application security and privacy,2014,1
Enabling intensional access control via preference-aware query optimization,Nicholas L Farnan; Adam J Lee; Panos K Chrysanthis; Ting Yu,Abstract Although the declarative nature of SQL provides great utility to database users; itsuse in distributed database management systems can result in unintended consequences touser privacy over the course of query evaluation. By allowing users to merely say what datathey are interested in accessing without providing guidance regarding how to retrieve it;query optimizers can generate plans that leak sensitive query intension. To address thesetypes of issues; we have created a framework that empowers users with the ability to specifyaccess controls on the intension of their queries through extensions to the SQL SELECTstatement. In this demonstration; we present a version of PostgreSQL's query optimizer thatwe have modified to produce plans that respect these constraints while optimizing user-specified SQL queries in terms of performance.,Proceedings of the 18th ACM symposium on Access control models and technologies,2013,1
Computational Soundness about Formal Encryption in the Presence of Secret Shares and Key Cycles,Xinfeng Lei; Rui Xue; Ting Yu,Abstract The computational soundness of formal encryption is studied extensively followingthe work of Abadi and Rogaway [1]. Recent work considers the scenario in which secretsharing is needed; and separately; the scenario when key cycles are present. The noveltechnique is the use of a co-induction definition of the adversarial knowledge. In this paper;we prove a computational soundness theorem of formal encryption in the presence of bothkey cycles and secret shares at the same time; which is a non-trivial extension of formerapproaches.,Information and Communications Security,2011,1

Adaptive request scheduling for parallel scientific web services,Heshan Lin; Xiaosong Ma; Jiangtian Li; Ting Yu; Nagiza Samatova,Abstract Scientific web services often possess data models and query workloads quitedifferent from commercial ones and are much less studied. Individual queries have to beprocessed in parallel by multiple server nodes; due to the computation-and data-intensiveness of the processing. Meanwhile; each query is performed against portions of alarge; common dataset. Existing scheduling policies from traditional environments (namelycluster web servers and supercomputers) consider only the data or the computation aspectalone and are therefore inadequate for this new type of workload. In this paper; wesystematically investigate adaptive scheduling for scientific web services; by taking intoaccount parallel computation scalability; data locality; and load balancing.

Killing Two Birds with One Stone: Malicious Domain Detection with High Accuracy and Coverage,Issa Khalil; Bei Guan; Mohamed Nabeel; Ting Yu,Abstract: Inference based techniques are one of the major approaches to analyze DNS dataand detecting malicious domains. The key idea of inference techniques is to first defineassociations between domains based on features extracted from DNS data. Then; aninference algorithm is deployed to infer potential malicious domains based on theirdirect/indirect associations with known malicious ones. The way associations are defined iskey to the effectiveness of an inference technique. It is desirable to be both accurate (ie;avoid falsely associating domains with no meaningful connections) and with good coverage(ie; identify all associations between domains with meaningful connections). Due to thelimited scope of information provided by DNS data; it becomes a challenge to design anassociation scheme that achieves both high accuracy and good coverage.

Generating Synthetic Decentralized Social Graphs with Local Differential Privacy,Zhan Qin; Ting Yu; Yin Yang; Issa Khalil; Xiaokui Xiao; Kui Ren,Abstract A large amount of valuable information resides in decentralized social graphs;where no entity has access to the complete graph structure. Instead; each user maintainslocally a limited view of the graph. For example; in a phone network; each user keeps acontact list locally in her phone; and does not have access to other users' contacts. Thecontact lists of all users form an implicit social graph that could be very useful to study theinteraction patterns among different populations. However; due to privacy concerns; onecould not simply collect the unfettered local views from users and reconstruct adecentralized social network. In this paper; we investigate techniques to ensure localdifferential privacy of individuals while collecting structural information and generatingrepresentative synthetic social graphs.

Distributed Cardinality Estimation of Set Operations with Differential Privacy,Rade Stanojevic; Mohamed Nabeel; Ting Yu,In this paper we study the problem of estimating the cardinality of pairwise set operations(union and intersection) over sets possessed by different data owners; while preservingdifferential privacy. In our problem setting; a data owner could only communicate with anuntrusted server; and thus have to perturb its set data for privacy protection before sharingthem with the server. This problem setting is relevant to diverse applications in practice;including sensor-based traffic monitoring; cross-domain data integration; and combiningfindings from multiple surveys. To tackle this problem; we first adopt existing randomizedresponse technique to perturb the bit vector (to achieve differential privacy) and developtools which the server can use to derive the cardinality of set operations from therandomized bit vectors. However; the variance of the union/intersection estimator grows …,Privacy-Aware Computing (PAC); 2017 IEEE Symposium on,2017,*
Differentially Private K-Skyband Query Answering Through Adaptive Spatial Decomposition,Ling Chen; Ting Yu; Rada Chirkova,Abstract Given a set of multi-dimensional points; a k-skyband query retrieves those pointsdominated by no more than k other points. k-skyband queries are an important type of multi-criteria analysis with diverse applications in practice. In this paper; we investigatetechniques to answer k-skyband queries with differential privacy. We first propose a generaltechnique BBS-Priv; which accepts any differentially private spatial decomposition tree asinput and leverages data synthesis to answer k-skyband queries privately. We then showthat; though quite a few private spatial decomposition trees are proposed in the literature;they are mainly designed to answer spatial range queries. Directly integrating them withBBS-Priv would introduce too much noise to generate useful k-skyband results. To addressthis problem; we propose a novel spatial decomposition technique k-skyband tree …,IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy,2017,*

Through extensive experiments over various datasets collected from Amazon;we found that the discovered strong; positive communities are significantly more likely to beopinion spammer groups than other communities. Interestingly; while our approach focusedmainly on the characteristics of user interactions; it is comparable to the state of the artcontent-based classifier that mainly uses various content-based features extracted from userreviews.

Privacy technologies such asdifferential privacy have been proposed to resolve this deadlock; and there has been muchstudy of how to perform private data release of data in various forms.

Bounding trust under uncertain topology information in reputation-based trust systems,Xi Gong; Ting Yu; Adam J Lee,Abstract Reputation-based trust evaluation relies on the feedback of an entity's pastinteractions to estimate its trustworthiness for future behavior. Past work commonly assumesthat all the information needed in trust evaluation is always available; which; unfortunately;often does not hold in practice; due to a variety of reasons. A key problem is thus to study thequality of trust evaluation in the presence of incomplete information. In this paper; weinvestigate techniques to bound the output of a trust evaluation under uncertain graphtopologies of a reputation system. We present a rigorous formalism of the problem; andestablish connections between uncertain topology information and missing feedbackinformation through a property called edge reducibility. We show that the trust boundingproblem can be efficiently solved if a trust function is edge reducible.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2013,*
Poster: on trust evaluation with missing information in reputation systems,Xi Gong; Ting Yu; Adam Lee,Abstract Reputation plays a critical role in managing trust in decentralized systems. Quite afew reputation-based trust functions have been proposed in the literature for many differentapplication domains. However; one cannot always obtain all information required by thetrust evaluation process. For example; access control restrictions or high collect costs mightlimit the ability gather all required records. Thus; one key question is how to analyticallyquantify the quality of scores computed using incomplete information. In this paper; we starta first effort to answer the above question by studying the following problem: given theexistence of certain missing information; what are the worst and best trust scores (ie; thebounds of trust) a target entity can be assigned?

Practical user obligation systems that affect and depend on authorizations,Murillo de Barros Costa Rego Amazonas,Abstract Many authorization systems include some notion of obligations. However; most ofthe prior works concentrate on policy specification and enforcement of system obligations.Little attention has been given to user obligations that can depend on and affectauthorizations. A user obligation is an action that a user must perform in some stipulatedtime window. As automated tools seek to provide increasing support for managingpersonnel and projects; there is an increasing need for individual tasks to be assigned andcoordinated with authorization; and for supporting automated techniques. Thus; themanagement of user obligations that depend on and affect authorizations is a significantissue in the field of computer security. In this context; a user may incur an obligation that sheis unauthorized to perform.,*,2011,*
Calculation of equivalent parameters in cmut 1-d theoretical model,Wenchao Zhou; Ting Yu; Fengqi Yu,It's always difficult to model the real 3-D capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer(CMUT) because of the nonlinearity and filed coupling.

Property-based digitalcredentials [1] make it possible to prove that a party satisfies certain requirements imposedby the ongoing business. The problem is that digital credentials themselves also containvaluable information which a party does not want to show to just any strangers.

In trust management; a server often needs to evaluate a chain ofcredentials submitted by a client; which requires the server to perform multiple expensivedigital signature verifications. In this paper; we study low-bandwidth Denial-of-Service (DoS)attacks that exploit the existence of trust management systems to deplete server resources.Although DoS threat has been studied for some application-level protocols; egauthentication protocols; we show that it is especially destructive for trust managementsystems: exploiting the delegation feature in trust management languages; an attacker canforge a long credential chain to force a server to consume a large amount of computingresource. Using game theory as an analytic tool; we demonstrate that unprotected trust …,*,*,*
Supplemental Material: Scalable Distributed Service Integrity Attestation for Software-as-a-Service Clouds,Juan Du; Daniel J Dean; Yongmin Tan; Xiaohui Gu; Ting Yu,Proof: We can prove Proposition 1 by contradiction. Suppose the number of maliciousservice providers is less than| CG|. Then the graph formed by malicious nodes cannot coverthe entire graph; which means there exists one edge that is not incident to any of themalicious nodes. Thus; the edge must be incident to two benign nodes. Since two benignnodes always agree with each other; this contradicts with the existence of an inconsistencylink between them.,*,*,*
Revealing Implicit Communities to Incorporate into Recommender Systems,Euijin Choo; Ting Yu; Min Chi; Yan Lindsay Sun,Social connections often have a significant influence on personal decision making.Researchers have proposed novel recommender systems that take advantage of socialrelationship information to improve recommendations. These systems; while promising; areoften hindered in practice. Existing social networks such as Facebook are not designed forrecommendations and thus contain many irrelevant relationships. Many recommendationplatforms such as Amazon often do not permit users to establish explicit social relationships.And direct integration of social and commercial systems raises privacy concerns. In thispaper we address these issues by focusing on the extraction of implicit and relevantrelationships among users based upon the patterns of their existing interactions. Our work isgrounded in the context of item recommendations on Amazon. We investigate whether …,*,*,*
Poster: Toward Understanding Spamming Behavior in Public Forums,Euijin Choo; Ting Yu; Min Chi,Abstract—Users often express their opinions about an item in which they are interested inpublic forums. Despite the convenience; it also opens possibilities for attackers tomanipulate such forums with opinion spams. Recently; researchers have begun to payattention to opinion spams. While previous research has focused primarily on detection ofopinion spams based on text contents; relatively little is done to capture spammers' behaviorbased on user relationships. In this work we study opinion spam phenomena by detectingmalicious communities in public forums. Concretely; we focus on review systems (eg;Amazon; Yelp). In our previous work we found there exist users who have strongconnections to each other in Amazon based on their replying actions; which is not desirablebecause their opinions are likely to be biased towards each other. We show that such …,*,*,*
Test Generation and Redundant-Rule Detection for Access Control Policies,Evan Martin; Tao Xie; Ting Yu,Abstract Policy testing is an important technique for high assurance of correct specification ofaccess control policies. Existing approaches to policy testing mainly rely on tedious and adhoc manual test generation. These approaches often result in poor-quality test suites thatcannot systematically exercise various behaviors of access control policies. In this paper wepropose Targen; a framework and its supporting tool; to support efficient automated testgeneration for access control policies. Targen considers each rule in isolation andgenerates a set of requests (as test inputs) that satisfy the necessary conditions required forthat rule to be applied. By analyzing structural coverage information; Targen further reducesunnecessary generated requests. Redundant rules are rules that do not contribute to thesemantics of a policy; they are often infeasible for generated requests to cover. In addition …,*,*,*

Email-based File System for Personal Data,Jagan Srinivasan; Wei Wei; Xiaosong Ma; Ting Yu,ABSTRACT Email services have been offering growing email storage capacity; reliableservice; and powerful search capability; making them appealing as storage resources. In thispaper; we present EMFS; which aggregates back-end storage by establishing a RAID-likesystem on top of virtual email disks formed by email accounts. By replicating data acrossaccounts from different service providers; highly available storage services can beconstructed based on already reliable; cloud-based email storage. EMFS provides a POSIX-like file system interface that allows ubiquitous data access. We have implemented aprototype of EMFS and conducted experiments in a campus network. Our results indicatethat while EMFS cannot match the performance of highly optimized distributed file systemssuch as NFS and AFS; it performs quite closely to JungleDisk; a commercial cloud …,*,*,*

Differentially Private Spatial Decompositions,Graham Cormode Cecilia Procopiuc Divesh Srivastava; Entong Shen; Ting Yu,Abstract—Differential privacy has recently emerged as the de facto standard for private datarelease. This makes it possible to provide strong theoretical guarantees on the privacy andutility of released data. While it is well-understood how to release data based on counts andsimple functions under this guarantee; it remains to provide general purpose techniques thatare useful for a wider variety of queries. In this paper; we focus on spatial data; ie; any multi-dimensional data that can be indexed by a tree structure. Directly applying existingdifferential privacy methods to this type of data simply generates noise. We propose insteadthe class of “private spatial decompositions”: these adapt standard spatial indexing methodssuch as quadtrees and kd-trees to provide a private description of the data distribution.Equipping such structures with differential privacy requires several steps to ensure that …,*,*,*
