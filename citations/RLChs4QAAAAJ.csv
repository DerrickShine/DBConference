Mapping data in peer-to-peer systems: Semantics and algorithmic issues,Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Marcelo Arenas; Renée J Miller,Abstract We consider the problem of mapping data in peer-to-peer data-sharing systems.Such systems often rely on the use of mapping tables listing pairs of corresponding values tosearch for data residing in different peers. In this paper; we address semantic andalgorithmic issues related to the use of mapping tables. We begin by arguing why mappingtables are appropriate for data mapping in a peer-to-peer environment. We discussalternative semantics for these tables and we present a language that allows the user tospecify mapping tables under different semantics. Then; we show that by treating mappingtables as constraints (called mapping constraints) on the exchange of information betweenpeers it is possible to reason about them. We motivate why reasoning capabilities areneeded to manage mapping tables and show the importance of inferring new mapping …,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,323
Conditional functional dependencies for data cleaning,Philip Bohannon; Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Xibei Jia; Anastasios Kementsietsidis,We propose a class of constraints; referred to as conditional functional dependencies(CFDs); and study their applications in data cleaning. In contrast to traditional functionaldependencies (FDs) that were developed mainly for schema design; CFDs aim at capturingthe consistency of data by incorporating bindings of semantic ally related values. For CFDswe provide an inference system analogous to Armstrong's axioms for FDs; as well asconsistency analysis. Since CFDs allow data bindings; a large number of individualconstraints may hold on a table; complicating detection of constraint violations. We developtechniques for detecting CFD violations in SQL as well as novel techniques for checkingmultiple constraints in a single query. We experimentally evaluate the performance of ourCFD-based methods for inconsistency detection. This not only yields a constraint theory …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007.

Conditional functional dependencies for capturing data inconsistencies,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Xibei Jia; Anastasios Kementsietsidis,Abstract We propose a class of integrity constraints for relational databases; referred to asconditional functional dependencies (CFDs); and study their applications in data cleaning. Incontrast to traditional functional dependencies (FDs) that were developed mainly for schemadesign; CFDs aim at capturing the consistency of data by enforcing bindings of semanticallyrelated values. For static analysis of CFDs we investigate the consistency problem; which isto determine whether or not there exists a nonempty database satisfying a given set ofCFDs; and the implication problem; which is to decide whether or not a set of CFDs entailsanother CFD. We show that while any set of transitional FDs is trivially consistent; theconsistency problem is NP-complete for CFDs; but it is in PTIME when either the databaseschema is predefined or no attributes involved in the CFDs have a finite domain.

The hyperion project: from data integration to data coordination,Marcelo Arenas; Vasiliki Kantere; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Iluju Kiringa; Renée J Miller; John Mylopoulos,Abstract We present an architecture and a set of challenges for peer database managementsystems. These systems team up to build a network of nodes (peers) that coordinate at runtime most of the typical DBMS tasks such as the querying; updating; and sharing of data.Such a network works in a way similar to conventional multidatabases. Conventionalmultidatabase systems are founded on key concepts such as those of a global schema;central administrative authority; data integration; global access to multiple databases;permanent participation of databases; etc. Instead; our proposal assumes total absence ofany central authority or control; no global schema; transient participation of peer databases;and constantly evolving coordination rules among databases.

Apples and oranges: a comparison of RDF benchmarks and real RDF datasets,Songyun Duan; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Kavitha Srinivas; Octavian Udrea,Abstract The widespread adoption of the Resource Description Framework (RDF) for therepresentation of both open web and enterprise data is the driving force behind theincreasing research interest in RDF data management. As RDF data management systemsproliferate; so are benchmarks to test the scalability and performance of these systemsunder data and workloads with various characteristics. In this paper; we compare datagenerated with existing RDF benchmarks and data found in widely used real RDF datasets.The results of our comparison illustrate that existing benchmark data have little in commonwith real data. Therefore any conclusions drawn from existing benchmark tests might notactually translate to expected behaviours in real settings. In terms of the comparison itself;we show that simple primitive data metrics are inadequate to flesh out the fundamental …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,151
Mondrian: Annotating and querying databases through colors and blocks,Floris Geerts; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Diego Milano,Annotations play a central role in the curation of scientific databases. Despite theirimportance; data formats and schemas are not designed to manage the increasing variety ofannotations. Moreover; DBMS's often lack support for storing and querying annotations.Furthermore; annotations and data are only loosely coupled. This paper introduces anannotation-oriented data model for the manipulation and querying of both data andannotations. In particular; the model allows for the specification of annotations on sets ofvalues and for effectively querying the information on their association. We use the conceptof block to represent an annotated set of values. Different colors applied to the blocksrepresent different annotations. We introduce a color query language for our model andprove it to be both complete (it can express all possible queries over the class of …,Data Engineering; 2006. ICDE'06.

Building an efficient RDF store over a relational database,Mihaela A Bornea; Julian Dolby; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Kavitha Srinivas; Patrick Dantressangle; Octavian Udrea; Bishwaranjan Bhattacharjee,Abstract Efficient storage and querying of RDF data is of increasing importance; due to theincreased popularity and widespread acceptance of RDF on the web and in the enterprise.In this paper; we describe a novel storage and query mechanism for RDF which works ontop of existing relational representations. Reliance on relational representations of RDFmeans that one can take advantage of 35+ years of research on efficient storage andquerying; industrial-strength transaction support; locking; security; etc. However; there aresignificant challenges in storing RDF in relational; which include data sparsity and schemavariability. We describe novel mechanisms to shred RDF into relational; and novel querytranslation techniques to maximize the advantages of this shredded representation.

Data sharing in the hyperion peer database system,Patricia Rodríguez-Gianolli; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Maddalena Garzetti; Iluju Kiringa; Lei Jiang; Mehedi Masud; Renée J Miller; John Mylopoulos,Abstract This demo presents Hyperion; a prototype system that supports data sharing for anetwork of independent Peer Relational Database Management Systems (PDBMSs). Thenodes of such a network are assumed to be autonomous PDBMSs that form acquaintancesat run-time; and manage mapping tables to define value correspondences among differentdatabases. They also use distributed Event-Condition-Action (ECA) rules to enable andcoordinate data sharing. Peers perform local querying and update processing; and alsopropagate queries and updates to their acquainted peers. The demo illustrates the followingkey functionalities of Hyperion:(1) the use of (data level) mapping tables to infer newmetadata as peers dynamically join the network;(2) the ability to answer queries using datain acquaintances; and (3) the ability to coordinate peers through update propagation.,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,102
Rewriting regular XPath queries on XML views,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Xibei Jia; Anastasios Kementsietsidis,We study the problem of answering queries posed on virtual views of XML documents; aproblem commonly encountered when enforcing XML access control and integrating data.We approach the problem by rewriting queries on views into equivalent queries on theunderlying document; and thus avoid the overhead of view materialization andmaintenance. We consider possibly recursively defined XML views and study the rewriting ofboth XPath and regular XPath queries. We show that while rewriting is not always possiblefor XPath over recursive views; it is for regular XPath; however; the rewritten query may be ofexponential size. To avoid this prohibitive cost we propose a rewriting algorithm thatcharacterizes rewritten queries as a new form of automata; and an efficient algorithm toevaluate the automaton-represented queries. These allow us to answer queries on views …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007. IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,88
Using partial evaluation in distributed query evaluation,Peter Buneman; Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Anastasios Kementsietsidis,Abstract A basic idea in parallel query processing is that one is prepared to do morecomputation than strictly necessary at individual sites in order to reduce the elapsed time;the network traffic; or both in the evaluation of the query. We develop this idea for theevaluation of boolean XPath queries over a tree that is fragmented; both horizontally andvertically over a number of sites. The key idea is to send the whole query to each site whichpartially evaluates; in parallel; the query and sends the results as compact boolean functionsto a coordinator which combines these to obtain the result. This approach has severaladvantages. First; each site is visited only once; even if several fragments of the tree arestored at that site. Second; no prior constraints on how the tree is decomposed are needed;nor is any structural information about the tree required; such as a DTD. Third; there is a …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,71
Data sharing through query translation in autonomous sources,Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Marcelo Arenas,Abstract We consider the problem of data sharing between autonomous data sources in anenvironment where constraints cannot be placed on the shared contents of sources. Oursolutions rely on the use of mapping tables which define how data from different sources areassociated. In this setting; the answer to a local query; that is; a query posed against theschema of a single source; is augmented by retrieving related data from associated sources.This retrieval of data is achieved by translating; through mapping tables; the local query intoa set of queries that are executed against the associated sources. We consider both soundtranslations (which only retrieve correct answers) and complete translations (which retrieveall correct answers; and no incorrect answers) and we present algorithms to compute suchtranslations. Our solutions are implemented and tested experimentally and we describe …,Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases-Volume 30,2004,70
A framework for semantic link discovery over relational data,Oktie Hassanzadeh; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Lipyeow Lim; Renée J Miller; Min Wang,Abstract Discovering links between different data items in a single data source or acrossdifferent data sources is a challenging problem faced by many information systems today. Inparticular; the recent Linking Open Data (LOD) community project has highlighted theparamount importance of establishing semantic links among web data sources. Currently;LOD sources provide billions of RDF triples; but only millions of links between data sources.Many of these data sources are published using tools that operate over relational datastored in a standard RDBMS. In this paper; we present a framework for discovery ofsemantic links from relational data. Our framework is based on declarative specification oflinkage requirements by a user. We illustrate the use of our framework using several linkdiscovery algorithms on a real world scenario. Our framework allows data publishers to …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,69
Scalable multi-query optimization for SPARQL,Wangchao Le; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Songyun Duan; Feifei Li,This paper revisits the classical problem of multi-query optimization in the context ofRDF/SPARQL. We show that the techniques developed for relational and semi-structureddata/query languages are hard; if not impossible; to be extended to account for RDF datamodel and graph query patterns expressed in SPARQL. In light of the NP-hardness of themulti-query optimization for SPARQL; we propose heuristic algorithms that partition the inputbatch of queries into groups such that each group of queries can be optimized together. Anessential component of the optimization incorporates an efficient algorithm to discover thecommon sub-structures of multiple SPARQL queries and an effective cost model to comparecandidate execution plans. Since our optimization techniques do not make any assumptionabout the underlying SPARQL query engine; they have the advantage of being portable …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,67
Linkedct: A linked data space for clinical trials,Oktie Hassanzadeh; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Lipyeow Lim; Renée J Miller; Min Wang,Abstract: The Linked Clinical Trials (LinkedCT) project aims at publishing the first opensemantic web data source for clinical trials data. The database exposed by LinkedCT isgenerated by (1) transforming existing data sources of clinical trials into RDF; and (2)discovering semantic links between the records in the trials data and several other datasources. In this paper; we discuss several challenges involved in these two steps andpresent the methodology used in LinkedCT to overcome these challenges. Our approach forsemantic link discovery involves using state-of-the-art approximate string matchingtechniques combined with ontology-based semantic matching of the records; all performedin a declarative and easy-to-use framework. We present an evaluation of the performance ofour proposed techniques in several link discovery scenarios in LinkedCT.,arXiv preprint arXiv:0908.0567,2009,58
Distributed query evaluation with performance guarantees,Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Anastasios Kementsietsidis,Abstract Partial evaluation has recently proven an effective technique for evaluating BooleanXPath queries over a fragmented tree that is distributed over a number of sites. What leftopen is whether or not the technique is applicable to generic data-selecting XPath queries.In contrast to Boolean queries that return a single truth value; a generic XPath query returnsa set of elements; and its evaluation introduces difficulties to avoiding excessive datashipping. This paper settles this question in positive by providing evaluation algorithms andoptimizations for generic XPath queries in the same distributed and fragmented setting.These algorithms explore parallelism and retain the performance guarantees of theircounterpart for Boolean queries; regardless of how the tree is fragmented and distributed.First; each site is visited at most three times; and down to at most twice when …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,55
Coordinating peer databases using ECA rules,Vasiliki Kantere; Iluju Kiringa; John Mylopoulos; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Marcelo Arenas,Abstract Peer databases are stand-alone; independently developed databases that arelinked to each other through acquaintances. They each contain local data; a set of mappingtables and expressions; and a set of ECA rules that are used to exchange data among them.The set of acquaintances and peers constitutes a dynamic peer-to-peer network in whichacquaintances are continuously established and abolished. We present techniques forspecifying data exchange policies on-the-fly based on constraints imposed on the way inwhich peers exchange and share data. We realize the on-the-fly specification of dataexchange policies by building coordination ECA rules at acquaintance time. Finally; wedescribe mechanisms related to establishing and abolishing acquaintances by means ofexamples. Specifically; we consider syntactical constructs and executional semantics of …,International Workshop on Databases; Information Systems; and Peer-to-Peer Computing,2003,51
Scalable multi-query optimization for exploratory queries over federated scientific databases,Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Frank Neven; Dieter Van de Craen; Stijn Vansummeren,Abstract The diversity and large volumes of data processed in the Natural Sciences todayhas led to a proliferation of highly-specialized and autonomous scientific databases withinherent and often intricate relationships. As a user-friendly method for querying thiscomplex; ever-expanding network of sources for correlations; we propose exploratoryqueries. Exploratory queries are loosely-structured; hence requiring only minimal userknowledge of the source network. Evaluating an exploratory query usually involves theevaluation of many distributed queries. As the number of such distributed queries canquickly become large; we attack the optimization problem for exploratory queries byproposing several multi-query optimization algorithms that compute a global evaluation planwhile minimizing the total communication cost; a key bottleneck in distributed settings …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,48
A declarative framework for semantic link discovery over relational data,Oktie Hassanzadeh; Lipyeow Lim; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Min Wang,Abstract In this paper; we present a framework for online discovery of semantic links fromrelational data. Our framework is based on declarative specification of the linkagerequirements by the user; that allows matching data items in many real-world scenarios.These requirements are translated to queries that can run over the relational data source;potentially using the semantic knowledge to enhance the accuracy of link discovery. Ourframework lets data publishers to easily find and publish high-quality links to other datasources; and therefore could significantly enhance the value of the data in the nextgeneration of web.,Proceedings of the 18th international conference on World wide web,2009,46
Rewriting queries on SPARQL views,Wangchao Le; Songyun Duan; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Feifei Li; Min Wang,Abstract The problem of answering SPARQL queries over virtual SPARQL views iscommonly encountered in a number of settings; including while enforcing security policies toaccess RDF data; or when integrating RDF data from disparate sources. We approach thisproblem by rewriting SPARQL queries over the views to equivalent queries over theunderlying RDF data; thus avoiding the costs entailed by view materialization andmaintenance. We show that SPARQL query rewriting combines the most challengingaspects of rewriting for the relational and XML cases: like the relational case; SPARQL queryrewriting requires synthesizing multiple views; like the XML case; the size of the rewrittenquery is exponential to the size of the query and the views. In this paper; we present the firstnative query rewriting algorithm for SPARQL. For an input SPARQL query over a set of …,Proceedings of the 20th international conference on World wide web,2011,45
Scalable keyword search on large RDF data,Wangchao Le; Feifei Li; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Songyun Duan,Keyword search is a useful tool for exploring large RDF data sets. Existing techniques eitherrely on constructing a distance matrix for pruning the search space or building summariesfrom the RDF graphs for query processing. In this work; we show that existing techniqueshave serious limitations in dealing with realistic; large RDF data with tens of millions oftriples. Furthermore; the existing summarization techniques may lead to incorrect/incompleteresults. To address these issues; we propose an effective summarization algorithm tosummarize the RDF data. Given a keyword query; the summaries lend significant pruningpowers to exploratory keyword search and result in much better efficiency compared toprevious works. Unlike existing techniques; our search algorithms always return correctresults. Besides; the summaries we built can be updated incrementally and efficiently …,IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2014,43
Instance-based matching of large ontologies using locality-sensitive hashing,Songyun Duan; Achille Fokoue; Oktie Hassanzadeh; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Kavitha Srinivas; Michael J Ward,Abstract In this paper; we describe a mechanism for ontology alignment using instancebased matching of types (or classes). Instance-based matching is known to be a usefultechnique for matching ontologies that have different names and different structures. A keyproblem in instance matching of types; however; is scaling the matching algorithm to (a)handle types with a large number of instances; and (b) efficiently match a large number oftype pairs. We propose the use of state-of-the art locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) techniquesto vastly improve the scalability of instance matching across multiple types. We show thefeasibility of our approach with DBpedia and Freebase; two different type systems withhundreds and thousands of types; respectively. We describe how these techniques can beused to estimate containment or equivalence relations between two type systems; and we …,International Semantic Web Conference,2012,42

Advances and challenges for scalable provenance in stream processing systems,Archan Misra; Marion Blount; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Daby Sow; Min Wang,Abstract While data provenance is a well-studied topic in both database and workflowsystems; its support within stream processing systems presents a new set of challenges. Partof the challenge is the high stream event rate and the low processing latency requirementsimposed by many streaming applications. For example; emerging streaming applications inhealthcare or finance call for data provenance; as illustrated in the Century streamprocessing infrastructure that we are building for supporting online healthcare analytics. Atanytime; given an output data element (eg; a medical alert) generated by Century; thesystem must be able to retrieve the input and intermediate data elements that led to itsgeneration. In this paper; we describe the requirements behind our initial implementation ofCentury's provenance subsystem. We then analyze its strengths and limitations and …,International Provenance and Annotation Workshop,2008,37
Managing data mappings in the hyperion project,Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Marcelo Arenas; Renée J Miller,We consider the problem of mapping data in peer-to-peer systems. Such systems rely onsimple value searches to locate data of interest. However; different peers may use differentvalues to identify or describe the same data. To accommodate this; peer-to-peer systemsoften rely on mapping tables that list pairs of corresponding values for search domains thatare used in different peers. We illustrate how such tables are used in the genomicscommunity by expert curators. We then argue why mapping tables are appropriate for datamapping in a peer-to-peer environment and motivate the problem of managing these tables.The work presented is part of the Hyperion project.,Data Engineering; 2003.

SMOQE: A system for providing secure access to XML,Wenfei Fan; Floris Geerts; Xibei Jia; Anastasios Kementsietsidis,Abstract XML views have been widely used to enforce access control; support dataintegration; and speed up query answering. In many applications; eg; XML securityenforcement; it is prohibitively expensive to materialize and maintain a large number ofviews. Therefore; views are necessarily virtual. An immediate question then is how toanswer queries on XML virtual views. A common approach is to rewrite a query on the viewto an equivalent one on the underlying document; and evaluate the rewritten query. This isthe approach used in the Secure MOdular Query Engine (SMOQE). The demo presentsSMOQE; the first system to provide efficient support for answering queries over virtual andpossibly recursively defined XML views. We demonstrate a set of novel techniques for thespecification of views; the rewriting; evaluation and optimization of XML queries …,Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases,2006,33
SQLGraph: an efficient relational-based property graph store,Wen Sun; Achille Fokoue; Kavitha Srinivas; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Gang Hu; Guotong Xie,Abstract We show that existing mature; relational optimizers can be exploited with a novelschema to give better performance for property graph storage and retrieval than popularnoSQL graph stores. The schema combines relational storage for adjacency informationwith JSON storage for vertex and edge attributes. We demonstrate that this particularschema design has benefits compared to a purely relational or purely JSON solution. Thequery translation mechanism translates Gremlin queries with no side effects into SQLqueries so that one can leverage relational query optimizers. We also conduct an empiricalevaluation of our schema design and query translation mechanism with two existing popularproperty graph stores. We show that our system is 2-8 times better on query performance;and 10-30 times better in throughput on 4.3 billion edge graphs compared to existing …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,32
Partial evaluation for distributed XPath query processing and beyond,Gao Cong; Wenfei Fan; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Jianzhong Li; Xianmin Liu,Abstract This article proposes algorithms for evaluating XPath queries over an XML tree thatis partitioned horizontally and vertically; and is distributed across a number of sites. The keyidea is based on partial evaluation: it is to send the whole query to each site that partiallyevaluates the query; in parallel; and sends the results as compact (Boolean) functions to acoordinator that combines these to obtain the result. This approach possesses the followingperformance guarantees. First; each site is visited at most twice for data-selecting XPathqueries; and only once for Boolean XPath queries. Second; the network traffic is determinedby the answer to the query; rather than the size of the tree. Third; the total computation iscomparable to that of centralized algorithms on the tree stored in a single site; regardless ofhow the tree is fragmented and distributed. We also present a MapReduce algorithm for …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2012,31

Atleast one of a schema-less dataset including a plurality of resources one or more queryworkloads associated with the plurality of resources is received. Each resource is associatedwith at least a plurality of properties. At least one set of co-occurring properties from theplurality of properties is identified. A graph including a plurality of nodes is generated. Eachof the nodes represents a unique property in the set of co-occurring properties. The graphfurther includes an edge connecting each node representing a pair of co-occurringproperties.

Statistics-based parallelization of XPath queries in shared memory systems,Rajesh Bordawekar; Lipyeow Lim; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Bryant Wei-Lun Kok,Abstract The wide availability of commodity multi-core systems presents an opportunity toaddress the latency issues that have plaqued XML query processing. However; simplyexecuting multiple XML queries over multiple cores merely addresses the throughput issue:intra-query parallelization is needed to exploit multiple processing cores for better latency.Toward this effort; this paper investigates the parallelization of individual XPath queries overshared-address space multi-core processors. Much previous work on parallelizing XPath ina distributed setting failed to exploit the shared memory parallelism of multi-core systems.We propose a novel; end-to-end parallelization framework that determines the optimal wayof parallelizing an XML query. This decision is based on a statistics-based approach thatrelies both on the query specifics and the data statistics.

Data management issues on the semantic web,Oktie Hassanzadeh; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Yannis Velegrakis,We provide an overview of the current data management research issues in the context ofthe Semantic Web. The objective is to introduce the audience into the area of the SemanticWeb; and to highlight the fact that the area provides many interesting research opportunitiesfor the data management community. A new model; the Resource Description Framework(RDF); coupled with a new query language; called SPARQL; lead us to revisit someclassical data management problems; including efficient storage; query optimization; anddata integration. These are problems that the Semantic Web community has only recentlystarted to explore; and therefore the experience and long tradition of the databasecommunity can prove valuable.

Don’t mind your vocabulary: data sharing across heterogeneous peers,Md Mehedi Masud; Iluju Kiringa; Anastasios Kementsietsidis,Abstract The strong dynamics of peer-to-peer networks; coupled with the diversity of peervocabularies; makes query processing in peer database systems a very challenging task. Inthis paper; we propose a framework for translating expressive relational queries acrossheterogeneous peer databases. Our framework avoids an integrated global schema orcentralized structures common to the involved peers. The cornerstone of our approach is theuse of both syntax and instance level schema mappings that each peer constructs andshares with other peers. Based on this user provided mapping information; our algorithmapplies generic translation rules to translate SQL queries. Our approach supports both querytranslation and propagation among the peers preserving the autonomy of individual peers.The proposal combines both syntax and instance level mappings into a more general …,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2005,18

Forexample; a method for processing a query directed to data having a hierarchical structurewith a plurality of data nodes comprises the following steps. One or more structural attributesdescribing the hierarchical structure of the data are identified. The query is partitioned intotwo or more query partitions using at least one of the one or more identified structuralattributes. A parallel execution plan is determined for the query by splitting into componentsone or more of: the query into at least two of the query partitions; and the hierarchicalstructure of the data. The split components are executed in parallel on different computerprocesses according to the parallel execution plan.,*,2012,17

INTRODUCTION Data sharing systems permit the transformation; integra- tion; and exchangeof data that has been designed and devel- oped independently. The often subtle and complexinterde- pendencies within data can make the creation; maintenance; and comprehension ofsuch systems quite challenging. We have available a robust arsenal of tools and mechanismsfor reconciling semantic differences in how data is represented including views; mappings; andtransformation languages. There is also a growing maturity in our knowledge of how to create[19; 20] and use these mechanisms in such tasks as query answering [13]; data exchange[9]; data integration [17]; and data sharing [15].

A principled approach to bridging the gap between graph data and their schemas,Marcelo Arenas; Gonzalo Díaz; Achille Fokoue; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Kavitha Srinivas,Abstract Although RDF graph data often come with an associated schema; recent studieshave proven that real RDF data rarely conform to their perceived schemas. Since a numberof data management decisions; including storage layouts; indexing; and efficient queryprocessing; use schemas to guide the decision making; it is imperative to have an accuratedescription of the structuredness of the data at hand (how well the data conform to theschema). In this paper; we have approached the study of the structuredness of an RDFgraph in a principled way: we propose a framework for specifying structuredness functions;which gauge the degree to which an RDF graph conforms to a schema. In particular; we firstdefine a formal language for specifying structuredness functions with expressions we callrules. This language allows a user to state a rule to which an RDF graph may fully or …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,14

Provenance query evaluation: what's so special about it?,Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Min Wang,Abstract While provenance has been extensively studied in the literature; the efficientevaluation of provenance queries remains an open problem. Traditional query optimizationtechniques; like the use of general-purpose indexes; or the materialization of provenancedata; fail on different fronts to address the problem. Therefore; the need to developprovenance-aware access methods becomes apparent. This paper starts by identifyingsome key requirements that are to a large extent specific to provenance queries and arenecessary for their efficient evaluation. The first such property; called duality; requires that asingle access method is used to evaluate both backward provenance queries (which inputitems of some analysis generate an output item) and forward provenance queries (whichoutputs of some analysis does an input item generate).

Data sharing and querying for peer-to-peer data management systems,Anastasios Kementsietsidis,Abstract In this work; we investigate mechanisms to support data sharing and querying in apeer-to-peer data management system; that is; a peer-to-peer system where each peermanages its own data. To support data sharing; we propose the use of mapping tableswhich list pairs of corresponding data values that reside in different peers. Our workillustrates how automated tools can help manage the tables between multiple peers byinferring new tables from existing ones and by checking their consistency. In terms ofquerying; we propose a framework in which users pose queries only with respect to theirlocal peer. Then; we provide a rewriting mechanism that uses mapping tables to translate alocally expressed query to a set of queries over the acquainted peers.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2004,11

On the efficiency of provenance queries,Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Min Wang,While models for data provenance have been extensively studied in the literature; theefficient evaluation of the resulting provenance queries remains an open problem.Traditional query optimization techniques; like the use of general-purpose indexes; or thematerialization of provenance data; fail on different fronts to address the problem.Provenance-specific optimization techniques; like the use of customized indexes; similarlyprove inadequate since the techniques are bound to specific provenance models. Therefore;the need to develop generic provenance-aware techniques quickly becomes apparent. Inthis paper; we argue for such a generic technique in the form of a provenance indexstructure that can be used to efficiently evaluate provenance queries ina variety of contexts.By highlighting the limitations of existing techniques; we identify the set of key properties …,Data Engineering; 2009.

Configuring bitmap materialized views for optimizing XML queries,Xiaoying Wu; Dimitri Theodoratos; Anastasios Kementsietsidis,Abstract In recent years the inverted lists evaluation model along with holistic stack-basedalgorithms have been established as the most prominent techniques for evaluating XMLqueries on large persistent XML data. In this framework; we are using materialized views foroptimizing XML queries. We consider a novel approach which instead of materializing theanswer of a view materializes exactly the inverted sublists that are necessary for computingthe answer of the view. This originality allows storing view materializations as compressedbitmaps; a solution that minimizes the materialization space and empowers performingoptimization operations as CPU-efficient bitwise operations. To realize the potential ofbitmap materialized views in optimizing query performance; we define and address thefollowing problem (view configuration problem): given an XML tree and its schema find a …,World Wide Web,2015,6

Query relaxation across heterogeneous data sources,Verena Kantere; George Orfanoudakis; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Timos Sellis,Abstract The fundamental assumption for query rewriting in heterogeneous environments isthat the mappings used for the rewriting are complete; ie; every relation and attributementioned in the query is associated; through mappings; to relations and attributes in theschema of the source that the query is rewritten. In reality; it is rarely the case that suchcomplete sets of mappings exist between sources; and the presence of partial mappings isthe norm rather than the exception. So; practically; existing query answering algorithms failto generate any rewriting in the majority of cases. The question is then whether we cansomehow relax queries that cannot be rewritten as such (due to insufficient mappings); andwhether we can identify the interesting query relaxations; given the mappings at hand. In thispaper; we propose a technique to compute query relaxations of an input query that can …,Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2015,5

Schema matching,Anastasios Kementsietsidis,The values in the relations of a relational database are elements of one or more underlyingsets called domains. In practical applications; a domain may be infinite; eg; the set of naturalnumbers. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query when applied to such adatabase may be infinite; eg;{njn! 10}. A query Q is called finite if the value of Q whenapplied to any database is finite. Even when the database domains are finite; all that isnormally known about them is that they are some finite superset of the values that occur inthe database. In this case; the value of a relational calculus query may depend on such anunknown domain; eg;{xj 8yR (x; y)}.

Each row of the attributetables is dedicated to a subject of the graph data in the dataset and stores a JavaScriptObject Notation (JSON) object corresponding to the subject. Each row of the adjacencytables includes a hashtable containing properties and values of the subject for that row.,*,2016,*
An Executable Specification for SPARQL,Mihaela Bornea; Julian Dolby; Achille Fokoue; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Kavitha Srinivas; Mandana Vaziri,Abstract Linked Data on the web consists of over 1000 datasets from a variety of domains.They are queried with the SPARQL query language. There exist many implementations ofSPARQL; and this rich ecosystem has demanded a precise specification and compliancetests. However; the SPARQL specification has grown in complexity; and it is increasinglydifficult for developers to validate their implementations. In this paper; we present adeclarative specification for SPARQL; based on relational logic. It describes SPARQL withjust a few operators; and is executable: queries written in it can be directly executed againstreal datasets.,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2016,*
Systems and methods for query evaluation over distributed linked data stores,*,A method for query evaluation comprises receiving a query over a set of distributed datasources; decomposing the query into a set of sub-queries of the query; evaluating each sub-query in the set of sub-queries with respect to each data source in the set of distributed datasources; wherein evaluating comprises determining which data sources in the set ofdistributed data sources are capable of answering each sub-query and at what cost;computing a set of distributed plans by composing one or more of the sub-queries in one ormore of the data sources; evaluating each plan in the set of distributed plans; selecting a sub-set of plans from the set of distributed plans to be executed for responding to the query;executing the selected sub-set of plans; and returning results of the query.,*,2016,*

An Offline Optimal SPARQL Query Planning Approach to Evaluate Online Heuristic Planners,Achille Fokoue; Mihaela Bornea; Julian Dolby; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Kavitha Srinivas,Abstract In graph databases; a given graph query can be executed in a large variety ofsemantically equivalent ways. Each such execution plan produces the same results; but atdifferent computation costs. The query planning problem consists of finding; for a givenquery; an execution plan with the minimum cost. The traditional greedy or heuristic cost-based approaches addressing the query planning problem do not guarantee by design theoptimality of the chosen execution plan. In this paper; we present a principled framework tosolve the query planning problem by casting it into an Integer Linear Programming problem;and discuss its applications to testing and improving heuristic-based query planners.,International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering,2014,*
Methods and apparatus for evaluating XPath filters on fragmented and distributed XML documents,*,Methods and apparatus are provided for evaluating XPath filters on fragmented anddistributed XML documents. According to one aspect of the invention; a method is disclosedfor evaluating a query over a tree having a plurality of fragments distributed over a pluralityof sites. The method comprises the steps of identifying the plurality of sites storing at leastone of the plurality of fragments of the tree; providing the query to the plurality of identifiedsites; wherein each of the identified sites partially evaluates the query against one of morefragments of the tree stored by the respective site; obtaining partial results from the pluralityof identified sites; and composing the partial results to compute a result to the query. Thequery may be; for example; a boolean XPath query. The method can be performed; forexample; by a coordinating site that stores a root fragment of the tree.,*,2014,*

1. IMPORTANT DATES,Carmen Tang,It is widely understood that China shelters one of the richest mycofloras in the world. Thevariety of ecological zones; topological relief; and geographical extent supports this fact. Theoldest and largest mycological collection in the country is that maintained at the Institute ofMicrobiology; Academia Sinica; in Beijing. The Beijing herbarium (acronym: HMAS) wasestablished in 1953 and now houses over 75;000 specimens of fungi. The rapiddevelopment of mycology in China during the last two decades has not been brought tointernational attention (but see Bartholomew; Brittonia 3 1: 1-25; 1979; Ma; Taxon 38: 617-620; 1989). It is a pleasure; therefore; to introduce the mycological herbarium at Kunming;Yunnan; and to welcome foreign visitors and loan requests.,*,2013,*
Looking at the World Thru Colored Glasses,Floris Geerts; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Heiko Müller,Abstract There are two central issues in the curation of (scientific) databases: annotationmanagement and archiving. Both issues have been addressed by the Edinburgh databasegroup and led to the MONDRIAN annotation management system and the XArch archivingsystem; respectively. In this paper; we present an application of MONDRIAN to representand query the history of evolving databases. We show how the annotation model and querylanguage underlying MONDRIAN not only allows to answer queries about how individualdata values change over time; but also allows to capture and query structural changes thatoccur in a database over time; beyond the querying functionalities that XArch currentlyoffers.,*,2013,*

Peer-to-Peer Data Integration,Anastasios Kementsietsidis,P/FDM [5–7] integrated a functional data model with the logic programming language Prologfor general-purpose computation. The data model can be seen as an Entity-Relationshipdiagram with sub-types; much like a UML Class Diagram. The idea was for the user to beable to define a computation over objects in the diagram; instead of just using it as a schemadesign aid. Later versions of P/FDM included a graphic interface [2; 4] to build queries inDAPLEX syntax by clicking on the diagram and filling in values from menus.,*,2009,*
