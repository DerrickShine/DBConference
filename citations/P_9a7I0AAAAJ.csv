These techniques provide new means todiscover; monitor; and improve processes in a variety of application domains. There are twomain drivers for the growing interest in process mining. On the one hand; more and moreevents are being recorded; thus; providing detailed information about the history ofprocesses. On the other hand; there is a need to improve and support business processes incompetitive and rapidly changing environments. This manifesto is created by the IEEE TaskForce on Process Mining and aims to promote the topic of process mining.

Efficient consistency measurement based on behavioral profiles of process models,Matthias Weidlich; Jan Mendling; Mathias Weske,Engineering of process-driven business applications can be supported by process modelingefforts in order to bridge the gap between business requirements and system specifications.However; diverging purposes of business process modeling initiatives have led to significantproblems in aligning related models at different abstract levels and different perspectives.Checking the consistency of such corresponding models is a major challenge for processmodeling theory and practice. In this paper; we take the inappropriateness of existing strictnotions of behavioral equivalence as a starting point. Our contribution is a concept calledbehavioral profile that captures the essential behavioral constraints of a process model. Weshow that these profiles can be computed efficiently; ie; in cubic time for sound free-choicePetri nets wrt their number of places and transitions. We use behavioral profiles for the …,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,2011,223
The ICoP framework: Identification of correspondences between process models,Matthias Weidlich; Remco Dijkman; Jan Mendling,Abstract Business process models can be compared; for example; to determine theirconsistency. Any comparison between process models relies on a mapping that identifieswhich activity in one model corresponds to which activity in another. Tools that generatesuch mappings are called matchers. This paper presents the ICoP framework; which can beused to develop such matchers. It consists of an architecture and re-usable matchercomponents. The framework enables the creation of matchers from the re-usablecomponents and; if desired; newly developed components. It focuses on matchers that alsodetect complex correspondences between groups of activities; where existing matchersfocus on 1: 1 correspondences. We evaluate the framework by applying it to find matches inprocess models from practice. We show that the framework can be used to develop …,International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering,2010,172
Behavioral similarity–a proper metric,Matthias Kunze; Matthias Weidlich; Mathias Weske,Abstract With the increasing influence of Business Process Management; large processmodel repositories emerged in enterprises and public administrations. Their effectiveutilization requires meaningful and efficient capabilities to search for models that go beyondtext based search or folder navigation; eg; by similarity. Existing measures for process modelsimilarity are often not applicable for efficient similarity search; as they lack metric features.In this paper; we introduce a proper metric to quantify process similarity based on behavioralprofiles. It is grounded in the Jaccard coefficient and leverages behavioral relations betweenpairs of process model activities. The metric is successfully evaluated towards itsapproximation of human similarity assessment.,International Conference on Business Process Management,2011,126
Declarative versus imperative process modeling languages: The issue of understandability,Dirk Fahland; Daniel Lübke; Jan Mendling; Hajo Reijers; Barbara Weber; Matthias Weidlich; Stefan Zugal,Abstract Advantages and shortcomings of different process modeling languages are heavilydebated; both in academia and industry; but little evidence is presented to supportjudgements. With this paper we aim to contribute to a more rigorous; theoretical discussionof the topic by drawing a link to well-established research on program comprehension. Inparticular; we focus on imperative and declarative techniques of modeling a process.Cognitive research has demonstrated that imperative programs deliver sequentialinformation much better while declarative programs offer clear insight into circumstantialinformation. In this paper we show that in principle this argument can be transferred torespective features of process modeling languages. Our contribution is a pair of propositionsthat are routed in the cognitive dimensions framework. In future research; we aim to …,*,2009,125
Visually specifying compliance rules and explaining their violations for business processes,Ahmed Awad; Matthias Weidlich; Mathias Weske,Abstract A business process is a set of steps designed to be executed in a certain order toachieve a business value. Such processes are often driven by and documented usingprocess models. Nowadays; process models are also applied to drive process execution.Thus; correctness of business process models is a must. Much of the work has been devotedto check general; domain-independent correctness criteria; such as soundness. However;business processes must also adhere to and show compliance with various regulations andconstraints; the so-called compliance requirements. These are domain-dependentrequirements. In many situations; verifying compliance on a model level is of great value;since violations can be resolved in an early stage prior to execution. However; this calls forusing formal verification techniques; eg; model checking; that are too complex for …,Journal of Visual Languages & Computing,2011,88
Process compliance analysis based on behavioural profiles,Matthias Weidlich; Artem Polyvyanyy; Nirmit Desai; Jan Mendling; Mathias Weske,Abstract Process compliance measurement is getting increasing attention in companies dueto stricter legal requirements and market pressure for operational excellence. In order tojudge on compliance of the business processing; the degree of behavioural deviation of acase; ie; an observed execution sequence; is quantified with respect to a process model(referred to as fitness; or recall). Recently; different compliance measures have beenproposed. Still; nearly all of them are grounded on state-based techniques and the traceequivalence criterion; in particular. As a consequence; these approaches have to deal withthe state explosion problem. In this paper; we argue that a behavioural abstraction may beleveraged to measure the compliance of a process log–a collection of cases. To this end; weutilise causal behavioural profiles that capture the behavioural characteristics of process …,Information Systems,2011,87
Specification; verification and explanation of violation for data aware compliance rules,Ahmed Awad; Matthias Weidlich; Mathias Weske,Abstract Compliance checking is becoming an inevitable step in the business processesmanagement life cycle. Languages for expressing compliance requirements should addressthe fundamental aspects of process modeling; ie control flow; data handling; and resources.Most of compliance checking approaches focus on verifying aspects related to control flow.Moreover; giving useful feedback in case of violation is almost neglected. In this paper; wedemonstrate how data can be incorporated into the specification of compliance rules. Wecall these rules data aware. Building upon our previous work; we extend BPMN-Q; a querylanguage we developed; to express these rules as queries and formalize these rules bymapping them into PLTL. In addition; whenever a compliance rule is violated; executionpaths causing violations are visualized to the user. To achieve this; temporal logic …,*,2009,87
Change propagation in process models using behavioural profiles,Matthias Weidlich; Mathias Weske; Jan Mendling,Business process change is at the very core of business process management; which aimsat enabling flexible adaptation to changing business needs. However; the wide variety ofdrivers for business process modeling initiatives; reaching from business evolution toprocess enactment; results in multiple models that overlap in content due to serving differentpurposes. That; in turn; imposes serious challenges for the propagation of changes betweenthese process models. Given a change in one model; this paper introduces an approach todetermine a change region in another model by exploiting the behavioral profile ofcorresponding activities. It; therefore; supports the process of change propagation andeases the synchronization of process models significantly. As a major contribution; ourapproach can handle changes in pairs of models; even if they are not defined in terms of …,Services Computing; 2009. SCC'09. IEEE International Conference on,2009,77
BPEL to BPMN: the myth of a straight-forward mapping,Matthias Weidlich; Gero Decker; Alexander Großkopf; Mathias Weske,Abstract An alignment of the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) and theBusiness Process Modelling Notation (BPMN) promises seamless integration of processdocumentation and executable process definitions. Thus; a lot of research has beenconducted on a mapping from BPMN to BPEL. The other perspective of this alignment; ie aBPEL-to-BPMN mapping; was largely neglected. This paper presents a condenseddiscussion of such a mapping and its pitfalls. We illustrate why such a mapping is not asstraight-forward as commonly assumed and discuss the gaps to be bridged towards a betteralignment of both languages.,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2008,74
Heterogeneous Stream Processing and Crowdsourcing for Urban Traffic Management.,Alexander Artikis; Matthias Weidlich; Francois Schnitzler; Ioannis Boutsis; Thomas Liebig; Nico Piatkowski; Christian Bockermann; Katharina Morik; Vana Kalogeraki; Jakub Marecek; Avigdor Gal; Shie Mannor; Dimitrios Gunopulos; Dermot Kinane,ABSTRACT Urban traffic gathers increasing interest as cities become bigger; crowded and“smart”. We present a system for heterogeneous stream processing and crowdsourcingsupporting intelligent urban traffic management. Complex events related to traffic congestion(trends) are detected from heterogeneous sources involving fixed sensors mounted onintersections and mobile sensors mounted on public transport vehicles. To deal with dataveracity; a crowdsourcing component handles and resolves sensor disagreement.Furthermore; to deal with data sparsity; a traffic modelling component offers information inareas with low sensor coverage. We demonstrate the system with a real-world use-casefrom Dublin city; Ireland.,EDBT,2014,71
Probabilistic optimization of semantic process model matching,Henrik Leopold; Mathias Niepert; Matthias Weidlich; Jan Mendling; Remco Dijkman; Heiner Stuckenschmidt,Abstract Business process models are increasingly used by companies; often yieldingrepositories of several thousand models. These models are of great value for businessanalysis such as service identification or process standardization. A problem is though thatmany of these analyses require the pairwise comparison of process models; which is hardlyfeasible to do manually given an extensive number of models. While the computation ofsimilarity between a pair of process models has been intensively studied in recent years;there is a notable gap on automatically matching activities of two process models. In thispaper; we develop an approach based on semantic techniques and probabilisticoptimization. We evaluate our approach using a sample of admission processes fromdifferent universities.,International Conference on Business Process Management,2012,65
Event-based monitoring of process execution violations,Matthias Weidlich; Holger Ziekow; Jan Mendling; Oliver Günther; Mathias Weske; Nirmit Desai,Abstract Process-aware information systems support business operations as they aretypically defined in a normative process model. Often these systems do not directly executethe process model; but provide the flexibility to deviate from the normative model. This paperproposes a method for monitoring control-flow deviations during process execution. Ourcontribution is a formal technique to derive monitoring queries from a process model; suchthat they can be directly used in a complex event processing environment. Furthermore; wealso introduce an approach to filter and aggregate query results to provide compactfeedback on deviations. Our techniques is applied in a case study within the IT serviceindustry.,International conference on business process management,2011,64
Report: The process model matching contest 2013,Ugur Cayoglu; Remco Dijkman; Marlon Dumas; Peter Fettke; Luciano García-Bañuelos; Philip Hake; Christopher Klinkmüller; Henrik Leopold; André Ludwig; Peter Loos; Jan Mendling; Andreas Oberweis; Andreas Schoknecht; Eitam Sheetrit; Tom Thaler; Meike Ullrich; Ingo Weber; Matthias Weidlich,Abstract Process model matching refers to the creation of correspondences betweenactivities of process models. Applications of process model matching are manifold; reachingfrom model validation over harmonization of process variants to effective management ofprocess model collections. Recently; this demand led to the development of differenttechniques for process model matching. Yet; these techniques are heuristics and; thus; theirresults are inherently uncertain and need to be evaluated on a common basis. Currently;however; the BPM community lacks established data sets and frameworks for evaluation.The Process Model Matching Contest 2013 aimed at addressing the need for effectiveevaluation by defining process model matching problems over published data sets.

Tracing the process of process modeling with modeling phase diagrams,Jakob Pinggera; Stefan Zugal; Matthias Weidlich; Dirk Fahland; Barbara Weber; Jan Mendling; Hajo A Reijers,Abstract The quality of a business process model is presumably highly dependent upon themodeling process that was followed to create it. Still; there is a lack of concepts to investigatethis connection empirically. This paper introduces the formal concept of a phase diagramthrough which the modeling process can be analyzed; and a corresponding implementationto study a modeler's sequence of actions. In an experiment building on these assets; weobserved a group of modelers engaging in the act of modeling. The collected data is used todemonstrate our approach for analyzing the process of process modeling. Additionally; weare presenting first insights and sketch requirements for future experiments.,International Conference on Business Process Management,2011,56
Declarative versus imperative process modeling languages: the issue of maintainability,Dirk Fahland; Jan Mendling; Hajo A Reijers; Barbara Weber; Matthias Weidlich; Stefan Zugal,Abstract The rise of interest in declarative languages for process modeling both justifies anddemands empirical investigations into their presumed advantages over more traditional;imperative alternatives. Our concern in this paper is with the ease of maintaining businessprocess models; for example due to changing performance or conformance demands.

Tying process model quality to the modeling process: the impact of structuring; movement; and speed,Jan Claes; Irene Vanderfeesten; Hajo A Reijers; Jakob Pinggera; Matthias Weidlich; Stefan Zugal; Dirk Fahland; Barbara Weber; Jan Mendling; Geert Poels,Abstract In an investigation into the process of process modeling; we examined howmodeling behavior relates to the quality of the process model that emerges from that.Specifically; we considered whether (i) a modeler's structured modeling style;(ii) thefrequency of moving existing objects over the modeling canvas; and (iii) the overallmodeling speed is in any way connected to the ease with which the resulting process modelcan be understood. In this paper; we describe the exploratory study to build these threeconjectures; clarify the experimental set-up and infrastructure that was used to collect data;and explain the used metrics for the various concepts to test the conjectures empirically.

Action patterns in business process models,Sergey Smirnov; Matthias Weidlich; Jan Mendling; Mathias Weske,Abstract Business process management experiences a large uptake by the industry; andprocess models play an important role in the analysis and improvement of processes. Whilean increasing number of staff becomes involved in actual modeling practice; it is crucial toassure model quality and homogeneity along with providing suitable aids for creatingmodels. In this paper we consider the problem of offering recommendations to the userduring the act of modeling. Our key contribution is a concept for defining and identifyingaction patterns-chunks of actions often appearing together in business processes. Inparticular; we specify action patterns and demonstrate how they can be identified fromexisting process model repositories using association rule mining techniques. Actionpatterns can then be used to suggest additional actions for a process model. Our …,*,2009,54
Business process model abstraction based on behavioral profiles,Sergey Smirnov; Matthias Weidlich; Jan Mendling,Abstract A variety of drivers for process modeling efforts; from low-level service orchestrationto high-level decision support; results in many process models describing one businessprocess. Depending on the modeling purpose; these models differ with respect to the modelgranularity. Business process model abstraction (BPMA) emerged as a technique that givena process model delivers a high-level process representation containing more coarse-grained activities and overall ordering constraints between them. Thereby; BPMA reducesthe number of models capturing the same business process on different abstraction levels.In this paper; we present an abstraction approach that derives control flow dependencies foractivities of an abstract model; once the groups of related activities are selected foraggregation. In contrast to the existing work; we allow for arbitrary activity groupings. To …,International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing,2010,50
Queue mining–predicting delays in service processes,Arik Senderovich; Matthias Weidlich; Avigdor Gal; Avishai Mandelbaum,Abstract Information systems have been widely adopted to support service processes invarious domains; eg; in the telecommunication; finance; and health sectors. Recently; workon process mining showed how management of these processes; and engineering ofsupporting systems; can be guided by models extracted from the event logs that arerecorded during process operation. In this work; we establish a queueing perspective inoperational process mining. We propose to consider queues as first-class citizens and usequeueing theory as a basis for queue mining techniques. To demonstrate the value of queuemining; we revisit the specific operational problem of online delay prediction: using eventdata; we show that queue mining yields accurate online predictions of case delay.,International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering,2014,49
Minimizing efforts in validating crowd answers,Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung; Duong Chi Thang; Matthias Weidlich; Karl Aberer,Abstract In recent years; crowdsourcing has become essential in a wide range of Webapplications. One of the biggest challenges of crowdsourcing is the quality of crowd answersas workers have wide-ranging levels of expertise and the worker community may containfaulty workers. Although various techniques for quality control have been proposed; a post-processing phase in which crowd answers are validated is still required. Validation istypically conducted by experts; whose availability is limited and who incur high costs.Therefore; we develop a probabilistic model that helps to identify the most beneficialvalidation questions in terms of both; improvement of result correctness and detection offaulty workers. Our approach allows us to guide the expert's work by collecting input on themost problematic cases; thereby achieving a set of high quality answers even if the expert …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,46
Action patterns in business process model repositories,Sergey Smirnov; Matthias Weidlich; Jan Mendling; Mathias Weske,Abstract Business process models are extensively used in companies to document andimprove business operations. In essence; there are two major challenges. The increasingnumber of staff with little modeling expertise involved in model design requires newconcepts for quality assurance. Moreover; the huge number of process models typicallymaintained in a model repository impedes extraction of general process knowledge; whichcan be used for assistance. This article investigates action patterns as a means to addressthese challenges. Action patterns capture chunks of actions often appearing together inbusiness processes. We formalize the action pattern concept; including several types ofbehavioral connection; different abstraction levels; and varying action sensitivity to businessobjects. Our concepts are evaluated based on a prototypical implementation; which we …,Computers in Industry,2012,46
Perceived consistency between process models,Matthias Weidlich; Jan Mendling,Abstract Process-aware information systems typically involve various kinds of processstakeholders. That; in turn; leads to multiple process models that capture a common processfrom different perspectives and at different levels of abstraction. In order to guarantee acertain degree of uniformity; the consistency of such related process models is evaluatedusing formal criteria. However; it is unclear how modelling experts assess the consistencybetween process models; and which kind of notion they perceive to be appropriate. In thispaper; we focus on control flow aspects and investigate the adequacy of consistencynotions. In particular; we report findings from an online experiment; which allows us tocompare in how far trace equivalence and two notions based on behavioural profilesapproximate expert perceptions on consistency.

Process compliance measurement based on behavioural profiles,Matthias Weidlich; Artem Polyvyanyy; Nirmit Desai; Jan Mendling,Abstract Process compliance measurement is getting increasing attention in companies dueto stricter legal requirements and market pressure for operational excellence. On the otherhand; the metrics to quantify process compliance have only been defined recently. A majorcriticism points to the fact that existing measures appear to be unintuitive. In this paper; wetrace back this problem to a more foundational question: which notion of behaviouralequivalence is appropriate for discussing compliance? We present a quantificationapproach based on behavioural profiles; which is a process abstraction mechanism.Behavioural profiles can be regarded as weaker than existing equivalence notions like traceequivalence; and they can be calculated efficiently. As a validation; we present a respectiveimplementation that measures compliance of logs against a normative process model …,International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering,2010,45
Propagating changes between aligned process models,Matthias Weidlich; Jan Mendling; Mathias Weske,Abstract There is a wide variety of drivers for business process modelling initiatives;reaching from organisational redesign to the development of information systems.Consequently; a common business process is often captured in multiple models that overlapin content due to serving different purposes. Business process management aims at flexibleadaptation to changing business needs. Hence; changes of business processes occurfrequently and have to be incorporated in the respective process models. Once a processmodel is changed; related process models have to be updated accordingly; despite the factthat those process models may only be loosely coupled. In this article; we introduce anapproach that supports change propagation between related process models. Given achange in one process model; we leverage the behavioural abstraction of behavioural …,Journal of Systems and Software,2012,44
Efficient computation of causal behavioural profiles using structural decomposition,Matthias Weidlich; Artem Polyvyanyy; Jan Mendling; Mathias Weske,Abstract Identification of behavioural contradictions is an important aspect of softwareengineering; in particular for checking the consistency between a business process modelused as system specification and a corresponding workflow model used as implementation.In this paper; we propose causal behavioural profiles as the basis for a consistency notion;which capture essential behavioural information; such as order; exclusiveness; andcausality between pairs of activities. Existing notions of behavioural equivalence; such asbisimulation and trace equivalence; might also be applied as consistency notions. Still; theyare exponential in computation. Our novel concept of causal behavioural profiles provides aweaker behavioural consistency notion that can be computed efficiently using structuraldecomposition techniques for sound free-choice workflow systems if unstructured net …,International Conference on Applications and Theory of Petri Nets,2010,44
Vertical alignment of process models–how can we get there?,Matthias Weidlich; Alistair Barros; Jan Mendling; Mathias Weske,Abstract There is a wide variety of drivers for business process modelling initiatives;reaching from business evolution and process optimisation over compliance checking andprocess certification to process enactment. That; in turn; results in models that differ incontent due to serving different purposes. In particular; processes are modelled on differentabstraction levels and assume different perspectives. Vertical alignment of process modelsaims at handling these deviations. While the advantages of such an alignment for inter-model analysis and change propagation are out of question; a number of challenges hasstill to be addressed. In this paper; we discuss three main challenges for vertical alignmentin detail. Against this background; the potential application of techniques from the field ofprocess integration is critically assessed. Based thereon; we identify specific research …,*,2009,44
Styles in business process modeling: an exploration and a model,Jakob Pinggera; Pnina Soffer; Dirk Fahland; Matthias Weidlich; Stefan Zugal; Barbara Weber; Hajo A Reijers; Jan Mendling,Abstract Business process models are an important means to design; analyze; implement;and control business processes. As with every type of conceptual model; a business processmodel has to meet certain syntactic; semantic; and pragmatic quality requirements to be ofvalue. For many years; such quality aspects were investigated by centering on the propertiesof the model artifact itself. Only recently; the process of model creation is considered as afactor that influences the resulting model's quality. Our work contributes to this stream ofresearch and presents an explorative analysis of the process of process modeling (PPM).We report on two large-scale modeling sessions involving 115 students. In these sessions;the act of model creation; ie; the PPM; was automatically recorded. We conducted a clusteranalysis on this data and identified three distinct styles of modeling.

Visualizing use case sets as bpmn processes,Daniel Lübke; Kurt Schneider,The goal of many software projects is the support of business processes. A typical businessprocess spans multiple Use Cases. This poses the difficulty of making the set ofencompassing Use Cases consistent with each other and functionality-wise complete withregards to the overall busi-ness process. Manual arrangements and reviews of Use Casesare burdensome and time-intensive. Therefore; an automatic approach is needed thatrestores an overview of the Use Cases and visualizes the control-flow of the result-ingbusiness process. Our approach uses pre-conditions; post-conditions; and triggers of UseCases to automatically assemble business processes in BPMN notation in order to solve thisproblem.,Requirements Engineering Visualization; 2008.

Modeling styles in business process modeling,Jakob Pinggera; Pnina Soffer; Stefan Zugal; Barbara Weber; Matthias Weidlich; Dirk Fahland; Hajo A Reijers; Jan Mendling,Abstract Research on quality issues of business process models has recently begun toexplore the process of creating process models. As a consequence; the question ariseswhether different ways of creating process models exist. In this vein; we observed 115students engaged in the act of modeling; recording all their interactions with the modelingenvironment using a specialized tool. The recordings of process modeling weresubsequently clustered. Results presented in this paper suggest the existence of threedistinct modeling styles; exhibiting significantly different characteristics. We believe that thisfinding constitutes another building block toward a more comprehensive understanding ofthe process of process modeling that will ultimately enable us to support modelers increating better business process models.,*,2012,36
Towards understanding process modeling–the case of the BPM academic initiative,Matthias Kunze; Alexander Luebbe; Matthias Weidlich; Mathias Weske,Abstract Business process models are typically graphs that communicate knowledge aboutthe work performed in organizations. Collections of these models are gathered to analyzeand improve the way an organization operates. From a research perspective; thesecollections tell about modeling styles; the relevance of modeling constructs; and commonformal modeling mistakes. With this paper; we outline a research agenda for investigatingthe act of process modeling using models of the BPM Academic Initiative. This collectioncomprises 1903 models; the majority captured in BPMN. The models were created bystudents from various universities as part of their process modeling education. As such; thecollection is particularly suited to investigate modeling practice since it is probably unique interms of modeling heterogeneity.

Efficient analysis of BPEL 2.0 processes using p-calculus,Matthias Weidlich; Gero Decker; Mathias Weske,The Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) has become the de-facto standard forthe description of Web Service compositions. A variety of formal approaches to decidecompatibility and consistency for BPEL processes has been presented. Nevertheless; theseapproaches suffer from high complexity and state explosion. Therefore we present a leanformalization of BPEL 2.0 based on the pi-calculus; that enables efficient reasoning. Due toour focus on behavioral compatibility and consistency checking (and not on comprehensiveformalization); we are able to reduce effort needed for process verification. Besides theexemplary application of our approach; we also compare it to existing BPEL formalizationsby means of complexity.,Asia-Pacific Service Computing Conference; The 2nd IEEE,2007,34
Queue mining for delay prediction in multi-class service processes,Arik Senderovich; Matthias Weidlich; Avigdor Gal; Avishai Mandelbaum,Abstract Information systems have been widely adopted to support service processes invarious domains; eg; in the telecommunication; finance; and health sectors. Informationrecorded by systems during the operation of these processes provides an angle foroperational process analysis; commonly referred to as process mining. In this work; weestablish a queueing perspective in process mining to address the online delay predictionproblem; which refers to the time that the execution of an activity for a running instance of aservice process is delayed due to queueing effects. We present predictors that treat queuesas first-class citizens and either enhance existing regression-based techniques for processmining or are directly grounded in queueing theory. In particular; our predictors target multi-class service processes; in which requests are classified by a type that influences their …,Information Systems,2015,33
Causal behavioural profiles–efficient computation; applications; and evaluation,Matthias Weidlich; Artem Polyvyanyy; Jan Mendling; Mathias Weske,Abstract Analysis of behavioural consistency is an important aspect of software engineering.In process and service management; consistency verification of behavioural models hasmanifold applications. For instance; a business process model used as system specificationand a corresponding workflow model used as implementation have to be consistent.Another example would be the analysis to what degree a process log of executed businessoperations is consistent with the corresponding normative process model. Typically; existingnotions of behaviour equivalence; such as bisimulation and trace equivalence; are appliedas consistency notions. Still; these notions are exponential in computation and yield aBoolean result. In many cases; however; a quantification of behavioural deviation is neededalong with concepts to isolate the source of deviation. In this article; we propose causal …,Fundamenta Informaticae,2011,32
Pay-as-you-go reconciliation in schema matching networks,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen; Thanh Tam Nguyen; Zoltan Miklos; Karl Aberer; Avigdor Gal; Matthias Weidlich,Schema matching is the process of establishing correspondences between the attributes ofdatabase schemas for data integration purposes. Although several automatic schemamatching tools have been developed; their results are often incomplete or erroneous. Toobtain a correct set of correspondences; a human expert is usually required to validate thegenerated correspondences. We analyze this reconciliation process in a setting where anumber of schemas needs to be matched; in the presence of consistency expectations aboutthe network of attribute correspondences. We develop a probabilistic model that helps toidentify the most uncertain correspondences; thus allowing us to guide the expert's work andcollect his input about the most problematic cases. As the availability of such experts is oftenlimited; we develop techniques that can construct a set of good quality correspondences …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2014,31
A foundational approach for managing process variability,Matthias Weidlich; Jan Mendling; Mathias Weske,Abstract A business process often shows different variations in a large organisation; due todifferent legal requirements in different countries; deviations in the IT infrastructure; ororganisational differences. These variants are documented in separate independentprocess models. Management of these variants imposes various challenges. Invariantbehaviour needs to be identified and redundancies among the variants have to be avoided.In this paper; we address these questions by defining a set-algebra for behavioural profiles.These profiles represent a behavioural abstraction of process models that can be computedefficiently. We trace back many questions of process variability management to set-theoreticoperations and relations defined for behavioural profiles. As a validation; we apply ourapproach to an industry model collection.,International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering,2011,30
How the structuring of domain knowledge helps casual process modelers,Jakob Pinggera; Stefan Zugal; Barbara Weber; Dirk Fahland; Matthias Weidlich; Jan Mendling; Hajo A Reijers,Abstract Modeling business processes has become a common activity in industry; but it isincreasingly carried out by non-experts. This raises a challenge: How to ensure that theresulting process models are of sufficient quality? This paper contends that a priorstructuring of domain knowledge; as found in informal specifications; will positively influencethe act of process modeling in various measures of performance. This idea is tested andconfirmed with a controlled experiment; which involved 83 master students in businessadministration and industrial engineering from Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin andEindhoven University of Technology. In line with the reported findings; our recommendationis to explore ways to bring more structure in the specifications that are used as input forprocess modeling endeavors.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2010,29
Deciding behaviour compatibility of complex correspondences between process models,Matthias Weidlich; Remco Dijkman; Mathias Weske,Abstract Compatibility of two process models can be verified using common notions ofbehaviour inheritance. However; these notions postulate 1: 1 correspondences betweenactivities of both models. This assumption is violated once activities from one model arerefined or collapsed in the other model or in case there are groups of correspondingactivities. Therefore; our work lifts the work on behaviour inheritance to the level of complex1: n and n: m correspondences.

Application scenarios of process model matching reachfrom model validation over harmonization of process variants to effective management ofprocess model collections. Recognizing this; several process model matching techniqueshave been developed in recent years. However; to learn about specific strengths andweaknesses of these techniques; a common evaluation basis is indispensable. The secondedition of the Process Model Matching Contest in 2015 hence addresses the need foreffective evaluation by defining process model matching problems over published data sets.This paper summarizes the setup and the results of the contest.

Predicting the quality of process model matching,Matthias Weidlich; Tomer Sagi; Henrik Leopold; Avigdor Gal; Jan Mendling,Abstract Process model matching refers to the task of creating correspondences amongactivities of different process models. This task is crucial whenever comparison andalignment of process models are called for. In recent years; there have been a few attemptsto tackle process model matching. Yet; evaluating the obtained sets of correspondencesreveals high variability in the results. Addressing this issue; we propose a method forpredicting the quality of results derived by process model matchers. As such; predictionserves as a case-by-case decision making tool in estimating the amount of trust one shouldput into automatic matching. This paper proposes a model of prediction for process matchingbased on both process properties and preliminary match results.,*,2013,27

Business process model abstraction based on synthesis from well-structured behavioral profiles,Sergey Smirnov; Matthias Weidlich; Jan Mendling,There are several motives for creating process models ranging from technical scenarios inworkflow automation to business scenarios in which management decisions are taken. As aconsequence; companies typically have different process models for the same process;which differ in terms of granularity. In this context; business process model abstractionserves as a technique that takes a process model as an input and derives a high-levelmodel with coarse-grained activities and the corresponding control flow between them. Inthis way; business process model abstraction reduces the number of models capturing thesame business process on different abstraction levels. In this article; we provide a solution tothe problem of deriving the control flow of an abstract process model for the case that anarbitrary grouping of activities is permitted. To this end; we use behavioral profiles and …,International journal of cooperative information systems,2012,27
On profiles and footprints–relational semantics for petri nets,Matthias Weidlich; Jan Martijn van der Werf,Abstract Petri net systems have been successfully applied for modelling business processesand analysing their behavioural properties. In this domain; analysis techniques that aregrounded on behavioural relations defined between pairs of transitions emerged recently.However; different use cases motivated different definitions of behavioural relation sets. Thispaper focusses on two prominent examples; namely behavioural profiles and behaviouralfootprints. We show that both represent different ends of a spectrum of relation sets for Petrinet systems; each inducing a different equivalence class. As such; we provide ageneralisation of the known relation sets. We illustrate that different relation setscomplement each other for general systems; but form an abstraction hierarchy fordistinguished net classes. For these net classes; namely S-WF-systems and sound free …,International Conference on Application and Theory of Petri Nets and Concurrency,2012,26
An iterative approach for business process template synthesis from compliance rules,Ahmed Awad; Rajeev Goré; James Thomson; Matthias Weidlich,Abstract Companies have to adhere to compliance requirements. Typically; both; businessexperts and compliance experts; are involved in compliance analysis of businessoperations. Hence; these experts need a common understanding of the business processesfor effective compliance management. In this paper; we argue that process templatesgenerated out of compliance requirements can be used as a basis for negotiation amongbusiness and compliance experts. We introduce a semi automated approach to synthesizeprocess templates out of compliance requirements expressed in Linear Temporal Logic(LTL). As part of that; we show how general constraints related to business processexecution are incorporated. Building upon existing work on process mining algorithms; ourapproach to synthesize process templates considers not only control-flow; but also data …,International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering,2011,26
Behavioural profiles: a relational approach to behaviour consistency,Matthias Weidlich,ABSTRACT Business Process Management (BPM) emerged as a means to control; analyse;and optimise business operations. Conceptual models are of central importance for BPM.Most prominently; process models define the behaviour that is performed to achieve abusiness value. In essence; a process model is a mapping of properties of the originalbusiness process to the model; created for a purpose. Different modelling purposes;therefore; result in different models of a business process. Against this background; themisalignment of process models often observed in the field of BPM is no surprise. Even if thesame business scenario is considered; models created for strategic decision making differ incontent significantly from models created for process automation. Despite their differences;process models that refer to the same business process should be consistent; ie; free of …,*,2011,25
The 4C spectrum of fundamental behavioral relations for concurrent systems,Artem Polyvyanyy; Matthias Weidlich; Raffaele Conforti; Marcello La Rosa; Arthur HM Ter Hofstede,Abstract The design of concurrent software systems; in particular process-aware informationsystems; involves behavioral modeling at various stages. Recently; approaches tobehavioral analysis of such systems have been based on declarative abstractions definedas sets of behavioral relations. However; these relations are typically defined in an ad-hocmanner. In this paper; we address the lack of a systematic exploration of the fundamentalrelations that can be used to capture the behavior of concurrent systems; ie; co-occurrence;conflict; causality; and concurrency. Besides the definition of the spectrum of behavioralrelations; which we refer to as the 4C spectrum; we also show that our relations give rise toimplication lattices. We further provide operationalizations of the proposed relations; startingby proposing techniques for computing relations in unlabeled systems; which are then …,International Conference on Applications and Theory of Petri Nets and Concurrency,2014,22
Traveling time prediction in scheduled transportation with journey segments,Avigdor Gal; Avishai Mandelbaum; François Schnitzler; Arik Senderovich; Matthias Weidlich,Abstract Urban mobility impacts urban life to a great extent. To enhance urban mobility;much research was invested in traveling time prediction: given an origin and destination;provide a passenger with an accurate estimation of how long a journey lasts. In this work; weinvestigate a novel combination of methods from Queueing Theory and Machine Learning inthe prediction process. We propose a prediction engine that; given a scheduled bus journey(route) and a 'source/destination'pair; provides an estimate for the traveling time; whileconsidering both historical data and real-time streams of information that are transmitted bybuses. We propose a model that uses natural segmentation of the data according to busstops and a set of predictors; some use learning while others are learning-free; to computetraveling time. Our empirical evaluation; using bus data that comes from the bus network …,Information Systems,2017,21
Result selection and summarization for web table search,Thanh Tam Nguyen; Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen; Matthias Weidlich; Karl Aberer,The amount of information available on the Web has been growing dramatically; raising theimportance of techniques for searching the Web. Recently; Web Tables emerged as amodel; which enables users to search for information in a structured way. However; effectivepresentation of results for Web Table search requires (1) selecting a ranking of tables thatacknowledges the diversity within the search result; and (2) summarizing the informationcontent of the selected tables concisely but meaningful. In this paper; we formalize theserequirements as the diversified table selection problem and the structured tablesummarization problem. We show that both problems are computationally intractable and;thus; present heuristic algorithms to solve them. For these algorithms; we prove salientperformance guarantees; such as near-optimality; stability; and fairness.

Matching business process models using positional passage-based language models,Matthias Weidlich; Eitam Sheetrit; Moisés C Branco; Avigdor Gal,Abstract Business operations are often documented by business process models. Use casessuch as system validation and process harmonization require the identification ofcorrespondences between activities; which is supported by matching techniques that copewith textual heterogeneity and differences in model granularity. In this paper; we present amatching technique that is tailored towards models featuring textual descriptions of activities.We exploit these descriptions using ideas from language modelling. Experiments with real-world process models reveal that our technique increases recall by up to factor five; largelywithout compromising precision; compared to existing approaches.,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2013,21
Self-adaptive event recognition for intelligent transport management,Alexander Artikis; Matthias Weidlich; Avigdor Gal; Vana Kalogeraki; Dimitrios Gunopulos,Intelligent transport management involves the use of voluminous amounts of uncertainsensor data to identify and effectively manage issues of congestion and quality of service. Inparticular; urban traffic has been in the eye of the storm for many years now and gathersincreasing interest as cities become bigger; crowded; and “smart”. In this work we tackle theissue of uncertainty in transportation systems stream reporting. The variety of existing datasources opens new opportunities for testing the validity of sensor reports and self-adaptingthe recognition of complex events as a result. We report on the use of a logic-based eventreasoning tool to identify regions of uncertainty within a stream and demonstrate our methodwith a real-world use-case from the city of Dublin. Our empirical analysis shows thefeasibility of the approach when dealing with voluminous and highly uncertain streams.,Big Data; 2013 IEEE International Conference on,2013,21
Object-sensitive action patterns in process model repositories,Sergey Smirnov; Matthias Weidlich; Jan Mendling; Mathias Weske,Abstract Organizations maintain large repositories of business process models. Whilemaintenance and management of these repositories are challenging; they also offeropportunities when used as a knowledge base systematically. For instance; repositories canbe leveraged to provide modeling support and; therefore; help to assure the consistency ofnewly created models with the existing ones. In the previous work we have introduced actionpatterns as reusable blocks of process models that can be derived from a model repository.In this paper we advance the initial results interpreting the action concept as a compositionof a verb and a business object. The subsequently identified action pattern types allow forfine-grained modeling support. We evaluate the novel concepts and compare them to theestablished action patterns using as a benchmark the SAP Reference Model; the real …,International Conference on Business Process Management,2010,21
Minimizing human effort in reconciling match networks,Hung Quoc Viet Nguyen; Tri Kurniawan Wijaya; Zoltán Miklós; Karl Aberer; Eliezer Levy; Victor Shafran; Avigdor Gal; Matthias Weidlich,Abstract Schema and ontology matching is a process of establishing correspondencesbetween schema attributes and ontology concepts; for the purpose of data integration.Various commercial and academic tools have been developed to support this task. Thesetools provide impressive results on some datasets. However; as the matching is inherentlyuncertain; the developed heuristic techniques give rise to results that are not completelycorrect. In practice; post-matching human expert effort is needed to obtain a correct set ofcorrespondences. We study this post-matching phase with the goal of reducing the costlyhuman effort. We formally model this human-assisted phase and introduce a process ofmatching reconciliation that incrementally leads to identifying the correct correspondences.We achieve the goal of reducing the involved human effort by exploiting a network of …,International Conference on Conceptual Modeling,2013,20
Generalised computation of behavioural profiles based on petri-net unfoldings,Matthias Weidlich; Felix Elliger; Mathias Weske,Abstract Behavioural profiles have been proposed as a concept to judge on the behaviouralconsistency of process models that depict different perspectives of a process. These profilesdescribe the observable relations between the activities of a process model. Consistencycriteria based on behavioural profiles are less sensitive to model projections than commonequivalence criteria; such as trace equivalence. Existing algorithms derive those profiles forunlabelled sound free-choice workflow nets efficiently. In this paper; we generalise thecomputation of behavioural profiles by relaxing the aforementioned assumptions. First; weintroduce an algorithm that derives behavioural profiles from the complete prefix unfolding ofa bounded Petri net. Hence; it is applicable in a more general case. Second; we lift theconcept to the level of labelled Petri nets. We also elaborate on findings of applying our …,International Workshop on Web Services and Formal Methods,2010,20

Saber: Window-based hybrid stream processing for heterogeneous architectures,Alexandros Koliousis; Matthias Weidlich; Raul Castro Fernandez; Alexander L Wolf; Paolo Costa; Peter Pietzuch,Abstract Modern servers have become heterogeneous; often combining multi-core CPUswith many-core GPGPUs. Such heterogeneous architectures have the potential to improvethe performance of data-intensive stream processing applications; but they are notsupported by current relational stream processing engines. For an engine to exploit aheterogeneous architecture; it must execute streaming SQL queries with sufficient data-parallelism to fully utilise all available heterogeneous processors; and decide how to useeach in the most effective way. It must do this while respecting the semantics of streamingSQL queries; in particular with regard to window handling. We describe Saber; a hybrid high-performance relational stream processing engine for CPUs and GPGPUs.

Computation of behavioural profiles of process models,Matthias Weidlich; Jan Mendling; Mathias Weske,In the context of process model alignment; the question of consistency between processes hasbeen open for quite a while. While the well-known 'Business-IT-Gap' (cf. [1; 2]) is only the mostprominent incarnation of this problem; the question of how to align models created for differentpurposes is fundamental. Clearly; there is a need for a consistency definition that is weaker thanthe existing equivalence criteria. This report introduces the notion of behavioural profiles. Theseprofiles capture the essential behavioural constraints of a process model. Therefore; they area means to assess consistency between process models in the context of model alignment. Weakerthan trace equivalence; equivalence of two behavioural profiles; nevertheless; ensures preservationof all dependencies between corresponding activities. We also show that consistency can bechecked for sound free-choice Petri nets in O(n3) time with n being the number of places …,Business Process Technology; Hasso Plattner Institute for IT-Systems Engineering.

Optimizing event pattern matching using business process models,Matthias Weidlich; Holger Ziekow; Avigdor Gal; Jan Mendling; Mathias Weske,A growing number of enterprises use complex event processing for monitoring andcontrolling their operations; while business process models are used to document workingprocedures. In this work; we propose a comprehensive method for complex eventprocessing optimization using business process models. Our proposed method is based onthe extraction of behavioral constraints that are used; in turn; to rewrite patterns for eventdetection; and select and transform execution plans. We offer a set of rewriting rules that isshown to be complete with respect to the all; seq; and any patterns. The effectiveness of ourmethod is demonstrated in an experimental evaluation with a large number of processesfrom an insurance company.

Behaviour equivalence and compatibility of business process models with complex correspondences,Matthias Weidlich; Remco Dijkman; Mathias Weske,Abstract Once multiple models of a business process are created for different purposes or tocapture different variants; verification of behaviour equivalence or compatibility is needed.Equivalence verification ensures that two business process models specify the samebehaviour. Since different process models are likely to differ with respect to their assumedlevel of abstraction and the actions that they take into account; equivalence notions have tocope with correspondences between sets of actions and actions that exist in one process butnot in the other. In this paper; we present notions of equivalence and compatibility that canhandle these problems. In essence; we present a notion of equivalence that works oncorrespondences between sets of actions rather than single actions. We then integrate ourequivalence notion with work on behaviour inheritance that copes with actions that exist …,The Computer Journal,2012,17
Querying process models by behavior inclusion,Matthias Kunze; Matthias Weidlich; Mathias Weske,Abstract Business processes are vital to managing organizations as they sustain acompany's competitiveness. Consequently; these organizations maintain collections ofhundreds or thousands of process models for streamlining working procedures andfacilitating process implementation. Yet; the management of large process model collectionsrequires effective searching capabilities. Recent research focused on similarity search ofprocess models; but querying process models is still a largely open topic. This articlepresents an approach to querying process models that takes a process example as inputand discovers all models that allow replaying the behavior of the query. To this end; weprovide a notion of behavioral inclusion that is based on trace semantics and abstraction.Additional to deciding a match; a closeness score is provided that describes how well the …,Software & Systems Modeling,2015,16
Scalable stateful stream processing for smart grids,Raul Castro Fernandez; Matthias Weidlich; Peter Pietzuch; Avigdor Gal,Abstract We describe a solution to the ACM DEBS Grand Challenge 2014; which evaluatesevent-based systems for smart grid analytics. Our solution follows the paradigm of statefuldata stream processing and is implemented on top of the SEEP stream processing platform.It achieves high scalability by massive data-parallel processing and the option of performingsemantic load-shedding. In addition; our solution is fault-tolerant; ensuring that the largeprocessing state of stream operators is not lost after failure. Our experimental results showthat our solution processes 1 month worth of data for 40 houses in 4 hours. When we scaleout the system; the time reduces linearly to 30 minutes before the system bottlenecks at thedata source. We then apply semantic load-shedding; maintaining a low median predictionerror and reducing the time further to 17 minutes. The system achieves these results with …,Proceedings of the 8th ACM International Conference on Distributed Event-Based Systems,2014,15
Making sense of top-k matchings: A unified match graph for schema matching,Avigdor Gal; Tomer Sagi; Matthias Weidlich; Eliezer Levy; Victor Shafran; Zoltán Miklós; Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung,Abstract Schema matching in uncertain environments faces several challenges; amongthem the identification of complex correspondences. In this paper; we present a method toaddress this challenge based on top-k matchings; ie; a set of matchings comprising only 1: 1correspondences derived by common matchers. We propose the unified top-k match graphand define a clustering problem for it. The obtained attribute clusters are analysed to derivecomplex correspondences. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach is able toidentify a significant share of complex correspondences.,Proceedings of the Ninth International Workshop on Information Integration on the Web,2012,15

Automatic generation of glossaries for process modelling support,Nicolas Peters; Matthias Weidlich,Abstract Process models are often used for human to human communication. Besides otheraspects; eg; the chosen modelling notation or the model layout; the labelling has a stronginfluence on the understandability and; therefore; quality of a model. Consequently; labelsshould be reused and aligned across different process models. In order to support thesegoals; a glossary might be applied in the course of modelling. In this article; we argue thatsuch a glossary can be generated automatically from the labels of an existing process modelcollection; eg; a reference model. We introduce an approach for such a glossary generationthat takes additional information on structural as well as control flow aspects into account.The applicability of our approach is illustrated by means of two case studies.

Consistency checking of compliance rules,Ahmed Awad; Matthias Weidlich; Mathias Weske,Abstract Compliance checking of business process models against regulation is inevitable.Due to various sources of compliance requirements; a conflict of interest of suchrequirements is very likely. Thus; it is crucial to analyze the relation between compliancerules to discover any possible conflicts before even checking such rules against processmodels. Although this step is important in the compliance management life cycle; there isalmost no work that studied this direction. In this paper; we start by checking for consistencybetween execution ordering compliance rules expressed in linear temporal logic (LTL);addressing control and data flow aspects. To achieve this; we rely on the generation ofBüchi automaton from LTL formulas. However; we show that domain-specific knowledge isof crucial importance to draw correct conclusions.,International Conference on Business Information Systems,2010,14
Using glossaries to enhance the label quality in business process models,Nicolas Peters; Matthias Weidlich,Abstract: Conceptual models are mostly used for human to human communication. Besidesseveral other aspects; that is; the chosen modelling notation or the model layout; thelabelling has a strong influence on the understandability and; therefore; quality of a processmodel. Consequently; labels should be reused and aligned across different process models;whereas similar labels such as homonyms should be avoided. In order to support thesegoals; in this paper; we describe an approach that applies a glossary for process modelling.On the one hand; we show how such a glossary that considers structural as well as controlflow aspects is generated from an existing collection of process models. The applicability ofour glossary generation and the appropriateness of the chosen structural and behaviouralaspects is evaluated with the SAP reference model. On the other hand; we introduce two …,8.

Mining resource scheduling protocols,Arik Senderovich; Matthias Weidlich; Avigdor Gal; Avishai Mandelbaum,Abstract In service processes; as found in the telecommunications; financial; or healthcaresector; customers compete for the scarce capacity of service providers. For such processes;performance analysis is important and it often targets the time that customers are delayedprior to service. However; this wait time cannot be fully explained by the load imposed onservice providers. Indeed; it also depends on resource scheduling protocols; whichdetermine the order of activities that a service provider decides to follow when servingcustomers. This work focuses on automatically learning resource decisions from events. Wehypothesize that queueing information serves as an essential element in mining suchprotocols and hence; we utilize the queueing perspective of customers in the miningprocess.

Conformance checking and performance improvement in scheduled processes: A queueing-network perspective,Arik Senderovich; Matthias Weidlich; Liron Yedidsion; Avigdor Gal; Avishai Mandelbaum; Sarah Kadish; Craig A Bunnell,Abstract Service processes; for example in transportation; telecommunications or the healthsector; are the backbone of today׳ s economies. Conceptual models of service processesenable operational analysis that supports; eg; resource provisioning or delay prediction. Inthe presence of event logs containing recorded traces of process execution; suchoperational models can be mined automatically. In this work; we target the analysis ofresource-driven; scheduled processes based on event logs. We focus on processes forwhich there exists a pre-defined assignment of activity instances to resources that executeactivities. Specifically; we approach the questions of conformance checking (how to assessthe conformance of the schedule and the actual process execution) and performanceimprovement (how to improve the operational process performance). The first question is …,Information Systems,2016,12

Completeness and ambiguity of schema cover,Avigdor Gal; Michael Katz; Tomer Sagi; Matthias Weidlich; Karl Aberer; Hung Quoc Viet Nguyen; Zoltán Miklós; Eliezer Levy; Victor Shafran,Abstract Given a schema and a set of concepts; representative of entities in the domain ofdiscourse; schema cover defines correspondences between concepts and parts of theschema. Schema cover aims at interpreting the schema in terms of concepts and thus; vastlysimplifying the task of schema integration. In this work we investigate two properties ofschema cover; namely completeness and ambiguity. The former measures the part of aschema that can be covered by a set of concepts and the latter examines the amount ofoverlap between concepts in a cover. To study the tradeoffs between completeness andambiguity we define a cover model to which previous frameworks are special cases. Weanalyze the theoretical complexity of variations of the cover problem; some aim atmaximizing completeness while others aim at minimizing ambiguity.

Net-based analysis of event processing networks–the fast flower delivery case,Matthias Weidlich; Jan Mendling; Avigdor Gal,Abstract Event processing networks emerged as a paradigm to implement applications thatinteract with distributed; loosely coupled components. Such a network consists of eventproducers; event consumers; and event processing agents that implement the applicationlogic. Event processing networks are typically intended to process an extensive amount ofevents. Hence; there is a need for performance and scalability evaluation at design time. Inthis paper; we take up the challenge of modelling event processing networks using colouredPetri nets. We outline how this type of system is modelled and illustrate the formalisation withthe widely used showcase of the Fast Flower Delivery Application (FFDA). Further; we reporton the validation of the obtained coloured Petri net with an implementation of the FFDA inthe ETALIS framework. Finally; we show how the net of the FFDA is employed for analysis …,International Conference on Applications and Theory of Petri Nets and Concurrency,2013,11

Isotactics as a foundation for alignment and abstraction of behavioral models,Artem Polyvyanyy; Matthias Weidlich; Mathias Weske,Abstract There are many use cases in business process management that require thecomparison of behavioral models. For instance; verifying equivalence is the basis forassessing whether a technical workflow correctly implements a business process; orwhether a process realization conforms to a reference process. This paper proposes anequivalence relation for models that describe behaviors based on the concurrencysemantics of net theory and for which an alignment relation has been defined. Thisequivalence; called isotactics; preserves the level of concurrency of aligned operations.Furthermore; we elaborate on the conditions under which an alignment relation can beclassified as an abstraction. Finally; we show that alignment relations induced by structuralrefinements of behavioral models are indeed behavioral abstractions.,International Conference on Business Process Management,2012,11
m3–a behavioral similarity metric for business processes,Matthias Kunze; Matthias Weidlich; Mathias Weske,Abstract. With the increasing uptake of business process management; companies maintainlarge scale process repositories consisting of hundreds or thousands of process models. Sofar; discovery within these repositories is limited to free text search or folder navigation. In aseparate stream of research; similarity measures were introduced to get a betterunderstanding of the relationships between process models. Unfortunately; calculating suchsimilarity is complex; so that these techniques cannot be used in large process modelrepositories; where they would be most valuable.,Services und ihre Komposition,2011,11
ERICA: Expert guidance in validating crowd answers,Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung; Duong Chi Thang; Matthias Weidlich; Karl Aberer,Abstract Crowdsourcing became an essential tool for a broad range of Web applications.Yet; the wide-ranging levels of expertise of crowd workers as well as the presence of faultyworkers call for quality control of the crowdsourcing result. To this end; many crowdsourcingplatforms feature a post-processing phase; in which crowd answers are validated by experts.This approach incurs high costs though; since expert input is a scarce resource. To supportthe expert in the validation process; we present a tool for\emph {ExpeRt guidance Invalidating Crowd Answers (ERICA)}.

Optimising complex event queries over business processes using behavioural profiles,Matthias Weidlich; Holger Ziekow; Jan Mendling,Abstract Complex event processing emerged as a technology that promises tight integrationof business process management with the flow of products in a supply chain. As part of that;complex event querying is used to monitor and analyse streams of events. The amount ofdata that needs to be processed along with the distribution of the event-emitting sourcesimpose serious challenges for efficient event querying mechanisms. In this paper; weassume that the business process to which the events relate is defined in terms of anormative process model. Based thereon; we show how this knowledge can be leveraged tooptimise complex event queries and their processing. To this end; we use the formal conceptof behavioural profiles as a behavioural abstraction of the process model.,International Conference on Business Process Management,2010,10

In articles; blogs; and wikis; people express their points of view in the form ofarguments; ie; claims that are supported by evidence. Discovery of arguments has a largepotential for informing decision-making. However; argument discovery is hindered by thesheer amount of available Web data and its unstructured; free-text representation. Theformer calls for automatic text-mining approaches; whereas the latter implies a need formanual processing to extract the structure of arguments. In this paper; we propose acrowdsourcing-based approach to build a corpus of arguments; an argumentation base;thereby mediating the trade-off of automatic text-mining and manual processing in argumentdiscovery. We develop an end-to-end process that minimizes the crowd cost while …,The VLDB Journal,2017,9
In log and model we trust? A generalized conformance checking framework,Andreas Rogge-Solti; Arik Senderovich; Matthias Weidlich; Jan Mendling; Avigdor Gal,Abstract While models and event logs are readily available in modern organizations; theirquality can seldom be trusted. Raw event recordings are often noisy; incomplete; andcontain erroneous recordings. The quality of process models; both conceptual and data-driven; heavily depends on the inputs and parameters that shape these models; such asdomain expertise of the modelers and the quality of execution data. The mentioned qualityissues are specifically a challenge for conformance checking. Conformance checking is theprocess mining task that aims at coping with low model or log quality by comparing themodel against the corresponding log; or vice versa. The prevalent assumption in theliterature is that at least one of the two can be fully trusted. In this work; we propose ageneralized conformance checking framework that caters for the common case; when …,International Conference on Business Process Management,2016,9
Connectivity of workflow nets: the foundations of stepwise verification,Artem Polyvyanyy; Matthias Weidlich; Mathias Weske,Abstract Behavioral models capture operational principles of real-world or designedsystems. Formally; each behavioral model defines the state space of a system; ie; its statesand the principles of state transitions. Such a model is the basis for analysis of the system'sproperties. In practice; state spaces of systems are immense; which results in hugecomputational complexity for their analysis. Behavioral models are typically described asexecutable graphs; whose execution semantics encodes a state space. The structure theoryof behavioral models studies the relations between the structure of a model and theproperties of its state space. In this article; we use the connectivity property of graphs toachieve an efficient and extensive discovery of the compositional structure of behavioralmodels; behavioral models get stepwise decomposed into components with clear …,Acta informatica,2011,9
Flexab-Flexible Business Process Model Abstraction.,Matthias Weidlich; Sergey Smirnov; Christian Wiggert; Mathias Weske,Abstract. Process models are a widely established means to capture business processes.Large organizations maintain process model collections with hundreds of process models.Maintenance of these collections can be supported by business process model abstraction.Given a detailed model; an abstraction technique derives a coarse grained process modelthat preserves the essential process properties. In this paper; we introduce Flexab; a toolthat realizes flexible process model abstraction. Arbitrary groups of activities may beselected for abstraction. Flexab is realized in a mashup environment; which allows forcreating different abstracted versions of a process model and comparing them on a singlescreen.,CAiSE Forum,2011,9
SMART: A tool for analyzing and reconciling schema matching networks,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen; Thanh Tam Nguyen; Vinh Tuan Chau; Tri Kurniawan Wijaya; Zoltán Miklós; Karl Aberer; Avigdor Gal; Matthias Weidlich,Schema matching supports data integration by establishing correspondences between theattributes of independently designed database schemas. In recent years; various tools forautomatic pair-wise matching of schemas have been developed. Since the matchingprocess is inherently uncertain; the correspondences generated by such tools are oftenvalidated by a human expert. In this work; we consider scenarios in which attributecorrespondences are identified in a network of schemas and not only in a pairwise setting.Here; correspondences between different schemas are interrelated; so that incomplete anderroneous matching results propagate in the network and the validation of acorrespondence by an expert has ripple effects. To analyse and reconcile such matchings inschema networks; we present the Schema Matching Analyzer and Reconciliation Tool …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,8
Event recognition challenges and techniques: Guest editors' introduction,Alexander Artikis; Avigdor Gal; Vana Kalogeraki; Matthias Weidlich,The concept of event processing is established as a generic computational paradigm invarious application fields; ranging from data processing in Web environments; over logisticsand networking; to finance and medicine [Cugola and Margara 2012]. Events report on statechanges of a system and its environment. Event recognition (event pattern matching[Luckham 2002]); in turn; refers to the detection of events that are considered relevant forprocessing; thereby providing the opportunity to implement reactive measures. Examplesconsist of the recognition of attacks in computer network nodes [Dousson and Maigat 2007];human activities on video content [Brendel et al. 2011]; emerging stories and trends on theSocial Web1; traffic and transport incidents in smart cities [Artikis et al. 2014b]; fraud inelectronic marketplaces [Schultz-Møller et al. 2009]; cardiac arrhythmias [Callens et al …,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT),2014,8
Architecture Blueprint for a Business Process Simulation Engine.,Stefan Krumnow; Matthias Weidlich; Rüdiger Molle,Abstract: Simulation of business process models allows for drawing conclusions on theperformance and costs of business processes before they are implemented or changed.Requirements for a business process simulation engine are specific to a concrete use caseand a dedicated business domain. In this paper; we focus on the simulation of clinicalpathways in a hospital. We elaborate on the requirements imposed by this use case in detailand propose an architecture blueprint for a simulation engine. It is based on annotatedBPMN process models and uses timed and colored Petri nets as the underlying formalism.,EMISA,2010,7

Towards vertical alignment of process models-a collection of mismatches,Matthias Weidlich; Gero Decker; Mathias Weske; Alistair Barros,Abstract. Process models are created to answer a specific purpose. Multiple models createdin the context of the same scenario; but for different purposes; differ with respect to their levelof abstraction. However; it is a common observation that differences between these modelsrelated not only to the applied abstraction level. Aspects that are of no relevance regardingthe purpose of the model are neglected; whereas other aspects that are relevant to answerthe purpose are added. These mismatches violate existing consistency notions betweenmodels of different abstraction levels; as these notions focus on strict refinement relationsbetween models. We argue that these models are not wrong. On the contrary; themismatches are a natural result of the different focus of these models. In this paper; wepresent a categorisation and informal description of these mismatches.,Hasso Plattner Institute; Tech. Rep,2008,7

To stimulateresearch on this promise and the limits thereof; in this article; we outline the challenges andopportunities of blockchain for business process management (BPM). We first reflect howblockchains could be used in the context of the established BPM lifecycle and second howthey might become relevant beyond.

Retaining data from streams of social platforms with minimal regret,Thanh Tam Nguyen; Chi Thang Duong; Matthias Weidlich; Hongzhi Yin; Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen,Abstract Today's social platforms; such as Twitter and Facebook; continuously generatemassive volumes of data. The resulting data streams exceed any reasonable limit forpermanent storage; especially since data is often redundant; overlapping; sparse; andgenerally of low value. This calls for means to retain solely a small fraction of the data in anonline manner. In this paper; we propose techniques to effectively decide which data toretain; such that the induced loss of information; the regret of neglecting certain data; isminimized. These techniques enable not only efficient processing of massive streamingdata; but are also adaptive and address the dynamic nature of social media. Experiments onlarge-scale real-world datasets illustrate the feasibility of our approach in terms of both;runtime and information quality.,Twenty-sixth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2017,6

Structural and behavioural commonalities of process variants.,Matthias Weidlich; Mathias Weske,Abstract. A common business process might exist in multiple variations in an enterprise; dueto different legal requirements in different countries; deviations in the supporting ITinfrastructure; or differences in the organisational structure. In order to explore and controlsuch variability; we argue that the notion of a core process; the invariant nucleus of allprocess variants; might be applied. In this paper; we discuss the spectrum of structural andbehavioural aspects that might be leveraged to define such a process.,ZEUS,2010,6
Discovery and validation of queueing networks in scheduled processes,Arik Senderovich; Matthias Weidlich; Avigdor Gal; Avishai Mandelbaum; Sarah Kadish; Craig A Bunnell,Abstract Service processes; for example in transportation; telecommunications or the healthsector; are the backbone of today's economies. Conceptual models of such serviceprocesses enable operational analysis that supports; eg; resource provisioning or delayprediction. Automatic mining of such operational models becomes feasible in the presenceof event-data traces. In this work; we target the mining of models that assume a resource-driven perspective and focus on queueing effects. We propose a solution for the discoveryand validation problem of scheduled service processes-processes with a predefinedschedule for the execution of activities. Our prime example for such processes are complexoutpatient treatments that follow prior appointments. Given a process schedule and datarecorded during process execution; we show how to discover Fork/Join networks; a …,International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering,2015,5
Extending the BPMN Syntax for Requirements Management,Sascha Goldner; Alf Papproth,Abstract Regulations and laws are a very determining factor in every business domain.Therefore it is absolutely necessary to consider these legal constraints already in the earlydesign phase of business processes in order to create process descriptions which arelegally valid. The business process modeling notation (BPMN) has become the method ofchoice when it comes to business process modeling. We extended the syntax by specificartifacts in order to explicitly represent legal constraints directly in the BPMN models. Legalconstraints can be considered as necessary requirements for business processes. Thereforeit is important to track whether all requirements respectively legal constraints have beenrepresented within the process models. As a consequence we extended our BPMN editor byan export functionality to be able to transfer the legal constraints as requirements into a …,International Workshop on Business Process Modeling Notation,2011,5

P $ $^ 3$ $-Folder: Optimal Model Simplification for Improving Accuracy in Process Performance Prediction,Arik Senderovich; Alexander Shleyfman; Matthias Weidlich; Avigdor Gal; Avishai Mandelbaum,Abstract Operational process models such as generalised stochastic Petri nets (GSPNs) areuseful when answering performance queries on business processes (eg 'how long will ittake for a case to finish?'). Recently; methods for process mining have been developed todiscover and enrich operational models based on a log of recorded executions ofprocesses; which enables evidence-based process analysis. To avoid a bias due toinfrequent execution paths; discovery algorithms strive for a balance between over-fittingand under-fitting regarding the originating log. However; state-of-the-art discoveryalgorithms address this balance solely for the control-flow dimension; neglecting possibleover-fitting in terms of performance annotations. In this work; we thus offer a technique forperformance-driven model reduction of GSPNs; using structural simplification rules. Each …,International Conference on Business Process Management,2016,4
The Projected TAR and its Application to Conformance Checking.,Johannes Prescher; Jan Mendling; Matthias Weidlich,Abstract: Relational semantics of business process models have seen an uptake in variousfields of application. As a prominent example; the Transition Adjacency Relation (TAR) hasbeen used; for instance; to conduct conformance checking and similarity assessment. TAR isdefined over the complete set of transitions of a Petri net and induces order dependenciesbetween pairs of them. In this paper; we consider TAR in a more general setting; in whichthe order dependencies shall be derived only for a subset of projected transitions. We showhow to derive this projected variant of TAR from the reachability graph of a reduced Petri net.We elaborate the projected TAR for conformance checking in a case from industry.,EMISA,2012,4

Model matching-processes and beyond,Avigdor Gal; Matthias Weidlich,Abstract. Conceptual models in general; and process models in particular; have beenestablished as a means to design; analyze; and improve information systems [1]. Thecreation; utilization; and evolution of such models is supported by manifold concepts andtechniques that offer; for instance; re-use driven modelling support; harmonization of modelvariants; model-based system validation; and effective management of model repositories.Many of these techniques share reliance on the identification of correspondences betweenthe entities of different models; also termed model matching. The accuracy and thereforeusefulness of techniques supporting the creation; utilization; and evolution of models ishighly dependent on the correctness and completeness of the result of model matching.

Measuring expected integration effort in service composition,Tomer Sagi; Avigdor Gal; Matthias Weidlich,Evaluating alternative solutions for service compositions is done by various properties; eachrequiring an associated evaluation measure. In this paper; we propose a new measure;namely integration effort; to capture the expected effort a human programmer is expected toinvest in integrating composed services into a functioning process. We present severalintegration effort evaluation measures; which were adapted from the related research areasof schema and ontology matching. These measures are embedded in an extendibleframework; allowing application in different levels of refinement. Our measures areempirically validated to be effective proxies of integration effort.,Services Computing (SCC); 2014 IEEE International Conference on,2014,3
Realising dead path elimination in BPMN,Matthias Weidlich; Alexander Grosskopf; Alistair Barros,The Web Service Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) lacks any standardgraphical notation. Various efforts have been undertaken to visualize BPEL using theBusiness Process Modelling Notation (BPMN). Although this is straightforward for themajority of concepts; it is tricky for the full BPEL standard; partly due to the insufficientlyspecified BPMN execution semantics. The upcoming BPMN~ 2.0 revision will provide thisclear semantics. In this paper; we show how the dead path elimination (DPE) capabilities ofBPEL can be expressed with this new semantics and discuss the limitations. We provide ageneric formal definition of DPE and discuss resulting control flow requirementsindependent of specific process description languages.,Commerce and Enterprise Computing; 2009. CEC'09.

IL-miner: instance-level discovery of complex event patterns,Lars George; Bruno Cadonna; Matthias Weidlich,Abstract Complex event processing (CEP) matches patterns over a continuous stream ofevents to detect situations of interest. Yet; the definition of an event pattern that preciselycharacterises a particular situation is challenging: there are manifold dimensions to correlateevents; including time windows and value predicates. In the presence of historic event datathat is labelled with the situation to detect; event patterns can be learned automatically. Tocope with the combinatorial explosion of pattern candidates; existing approaches work on atype-level and discover patterns based on predefined event abstractions; aka event types.Hence; discovery is limited to patterns of a fixed granularity and users face the burden tomanually select appropriate event abstractions. We present IL-M iner; a system thatdiscovers event patterns by genuinely working on the instance-level; not assuming a …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016,2

Lightweight collaboration management,Matthias Kunze; Hagen Overdick; Alexander Grosskopf; Matthias Weidlich,Abstract Collaboration processes are generally coordinated without an explicit notion of aguiding process. Even though this kind of work is performed in a rather structured manner;explicit software support to coordinate these processes is rare. On the other hand; processautomation is mainly considered for highly frequent processes; due to the cumbersomesetup of adequate systems and the process implementation effort. This paper presents amashup that effectively coordinates humans who strive for a collaborative goal. Participantscan design and enact their processes right away; a lightweight process execution engineautomatically coordinates participants through correlated messages. In contrast to classicmashups; we turn the architecture upside down and orchestrate Web applications and theirrespective service APIs.

The biconnected verification of workflow nets,Artem Polyvyanyy; Matthias Weidlich; Mathias Weske,Abstract Formal representations of business processes are used for analysis of the processbehavior. Workflow nets are a widely used formalism for describing the behavior of businessprocesses. Structure theory of processes investigates the relation between the structure of amodel and its behavior. In this paper; we propose to employ the connectivity property ofworkflow nets as an angle to their structural analysis. In particular; we show how soundnessverification can be organized using biconnected components of a workflow net. This allowsfor efficient identification and localization of flaws in the behavior of workflow nets and forsupporting process analysts with diagnostic information.,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2010,2

Answer validation for generic crowdsourcing tasks with minimal efforts,Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung; Duong Chi Thang; Nguyen Thanh Tam; Matthias Weidlich; Karl Aberer; Hongzhi Yin; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Crowdsourcing has been established as an essential means to scale humancomputation in diverse Web applications; reaching from data integration to informationretrieval. Yet; crowd workers have wide-ranging levels of expertise. Large workerpopulations are heterogeneous and comprise a significant amount of faulty workers. As aconsequence; quality insurance for crowd answers is commonly seen as the Achilles heel ofcrowdsourcing. Although various techniques for quality control have been proposed inrecent years; a post-processing phase in which crowd answers are validated is still required.Such validation; however; is typically conducted by experts; whose availability is limited andwhose work incurs comparatively high costs. This work aims at guiding an expert in thevalidation of crowd answers. We present a probabilistic model that helps to identify the …,The VLDB Journal,2017,1

Events in Business Process Implementation: Early Subscription and Event Buffering,Sankalita Mandal; Matthias Weidlich; Mathias Weske,Abstract Event handling is a fundamental concept for the implementation of businessprocesses. It enables the specification of how a process communicates with its environmentand how this environment influences the execution of a process. However; even feature-richlanguages for process specification such as BPMN are severely limited in their eventhandling semantics. They largely neglect the design choices to be made when deciding onwhen to subscribe to event sources and how to retrieve events for a particular processinstance. In this paper; we therefore propose a model for event handling in businessprocesses that is grounded in explicit subscriptions and event buffering. This model isintegrated in BPMN using its extension mechanism and comes with formal executionsemantics. Based on the latter; we further show how existing techniques for verification …,International Conference on Business Process Management,2017,1
Handling concept drift in predictive process monitoring,Marco Maisenbacher; Matthias Weidlich,Predictive process monitoring emerged as a technique to anticipate the outcome of arunning instance of a business process. To this end; it first constructs a forecast model basedon an encoding of traces of past process executions that are labelled with the predictiontarget. This model is then used to predict the outcome of a running process instance.However; existing approaches neglect that real-world processes are subject to continuouschange; so that prediction models need to adapt to concept drift. In this paper; we take upideas on incremental learning from general data mining and present a paradigm forpredictive process monitoring under concept drift. It is grounded in a systematicexperimental study that answers the questions of which encoding of process traces andwhich incremental learning strategies are particularly suited for predictive monitoring of …,Services Computing (SCC); 2017 IEEE International Conference on,2017,1
Feature learning for accurate time prediction in congested healthcare systems,Arik Senderovich; Matthias Weidlich; Avigdor Gal,ABSTRACT Time prediction in healthcare systems such as outpatient clinics; hospital wards;and emergency departments is an essential component of decision making. Predictions areused for effective and efficient resource allocation; optimised ambulance routing; andaccurate delay announcement. In this work; we focus on time prediction in congestedhealthcare systems; where patients share scarce resources such as nurses; physicians; andMRI machines. To achieve accurate time prediction in this setting; features describing theclinical state of the patient (eg; severity of condition; age; and medical history) need to becombined with features that capture cross-patient information. To include the interplay ofpatients in time prediction; we present a method to learn congestion-related features; suchas the current number of patients in the hospital and recent lengths-of-stay.

Measuring expected integration effort in web service composition,Tomer Sagi; Matthias Weidlich; Avigdor Gal,Abstract.

Flexible artifact-driven automation of product design processes,Ole Eckermann; Matthias Weidlich,Abstract Automated support of business processes by information systems can be seen asstate-of-the-art for many domains; such as production planning or customer relationshipmanagement. A myriad of approaches to the automation of business processes in thesedomains has been proposed. However; these approaches are not suited for highly creativeprocesses; as they are observed in the field of innovative product design. These processesrequire a high degree of flexibility of the process implementation. In this paper; we focus onproduct design processes and propose a methodology for the implementation of supportingworkflows. In order to cope with the imposed flexibility requirements; we follow an artifact-centric approach.

On the behavioural dimension of correspondences between process models.,Matthias Weidlich; Mathias Weske,Abstract. Enterprise-wide process harmonisation initiatives require the analysis ofcommonalities of existing business process models. That is; correspondences betweenactivities are identified; such that the behavioural equivalence of the models can beassessed thereafter. Due to refinements; these correspondences can relate sets of activitiesto each other; ie; there are complex 1: n or n: m correspondences. In this paper; we discusshow notions of behaviour inheritance can be applied in this context. In addition; weelaborate on how structural information can be leveraged to identify violations of behaviourinheritance.,ZEUS,2010,1

Computing Crowd Consensus with Partial Agreement,Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung; Huynh Huu Viet; Nguyen Thanh Tam; Matthias Weidlich; Hongzhi Yin; Xiaofang Zhou,Crowdsourcing has been widely established as a means to enable human computation atlarge-scale; in particular for tasks that require manual labelling of large sets of data items.Answers obtained from heterogeneous crowd workers are aggregated to obtain a robustresult. However; existing methods for answer aggregation are designed for discrete tasks;where answers are given as a single label per item. In this paper; we consider partial-agreement tasks that are common in many applications such as image tagging anddocument annotation; where items are assigned sets of labels. Common approaches for theaggregation of partial-agreement answers either (i) reduce the problem to several instancesof an aggregation problem for discrete tasks or (ii) consider each label independently. Goingbeyond the state-of-the-art; we propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric model to …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2018,*
Compound Trace Clustering to Generate Accurate and Simple Sub-Process Models,Yaguang Sun; Bernhard Bauer; Matthias Weidlich,Abstract Business process model discovery targets the construction of conceptual modelsfrom event data that has been recorded during the execution of a business process. While aplethora of discovery techniques have been proposed in the literature; most existingtechniques fail to cope with complex control-flow patterns as they are observed in event logsof highly flexible processes. In this paper; we follow the idea of splitting-up an event log intosub-logs; before applying process model discovery. This yields a set of sub-process models;one per sub-log; each describing a major variant of the business process. Unlike existingtechniques; our clustering approach is guided by the result of model discovery: It firstoptimises the average complexity of the resulting models; before improving the accuracy ofeach model in isolation. Our experimental evaluation highlights that our approach yields …,International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing,2017,*
Temporal Network Representation of Event Logs for Improved Performance Modelling in Business Processes,Arik Senderovich; Matthias Weidlich; Avigdor Gal,Abstract Analysing performance of business processes is an important vehicle to improvetheir operation. Specifically; an accurate assessment of sojourn times and remaining timesenables bottleneck analysis and resource planning. Recently; methods to create respectiveperformance models from event logs have been proposed. These works are severelylimited; though: They either consider control-flow and performance information separately; orrely on an ad-hoc selection of temporal relations between events. In this paper; we introducethe Temporal Network Representation (TNR) of a log; based on Allen's interval algebra; as acomplete temporal representation of a log; which enables simultaneous discovery of control-flow and performance information.

Retaining data from streams of social platforms with minimal regret,Nguyen Thanh Tam; Matthias Weidlich; Duong Chi Thang; Hongzhi Yin; Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung,Abstract Today's social platforms; such as Twitter and Facebook; continuously generatemassive volumes of data. The resulting data streams exceed any reasonable limit forpermanent storage; especially since data is often redundant; overlapping; sparse; andgenerally of low value. This calls for means to retain solely a small fraction of the data in anonline manner. In this paper; we propose techniques to effectively decide which data toretain; such that the induced loss of information; the regret of neglecting certain data; isminimized. These techniques enable not only efficient processing of massive streamingdata; but are also adaptive and address the dynamic nature of social media. Experiments onlarge-scale real-world datasets illustrate the feasibility of our approach in terms of both;runtime and information quality.,Proceedings of the 26th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2017,*

What-if Analysis with Conflicting Goals: Recommending Data Ranges for Exploration,Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung; Nguyen Thanh Tam; Matthias Weidlich; Duong Chi Thang; Xiaofang Zhou,ABSTRACT What-if analysis is a data-intensive exploration to inspect how changes in a setof input parameters of a model influence some outcomes. It is motivated by a user trying tounderstand the sensitivity of the model to a certain parameter in order to reach a set of goalsthat are defined over the outcomes. However; conducting what-if analysis manually is labour-intensive as it requires exploration of all possible combinations of parameter values. Efficientwhat-if exploration therefore calls for a partitioning of possible parameter values into dataranges and a unified representation of the obtained outcomes per range. Traditionaltechniques to capture data ranges; such as histograms; are limited to one outcomedimension. Yet; in practice; what-if analysis often involves conflicting goals that are definedover different dimensions of the outcome.

SMART: A tool for analyzing and reconciling schema matching networks,Hung Nguyen Quoc Viet; Tam Nguyen Thanh; Vinh Chau; Tri Kurniawan Wijaya; Zoltan Miklos; Karl Aberer; Avigdor Gal; Matthias Weidlich,Abstract—Schema matching supports data integration by establishing correspondencesbetween the attributes of independently designed database schemas. In recent years;various tools for automatic pair-wise matching of schemas have been developed. Since thematching process is inherently uncertain; the correspondences generated by such tools areoften validated by a human expert. In this work; we consider scenarios in which attributecorrespondences are identified in a network of schemas and not only in a pairwise setting.Here; correspondences between different schemas are interrelated; so that incomplete anderroneous matching results propagate in the network and the validation of acorrespondence by an expert has ripple effects.

It achieves high scalability by massive data-parallel processing and the option ofperforming semantic load-shedding. In addition; our solution is fault-tolerant; ensuring thatthe large processing state of stream operators is not lost after failure. Our experimentalresults show that our solution processes 1 month worth of data for 40 houses in 4 hours.When we scale out the system; the time reduces linearly to 30 minutes before the systembottlenecks at the data source.

From Executable Process Languages to Process Models,Matthias Weidlich,Abstract In recent years; the Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN) gained muchattention in the field of business process modelling. Intended as a modelling language;BPMN lacks a formal grounding and means to specify execution relevant details. Addressingthe demand for direct executability; xBPMN has been proposed as an enhancement ofBPMN with unambiguous execution semantics and advanced data handling and messageflow concepts. xBPMN therefore competes with the de-facto standard for the description ofexecutable processes; ie the Web Service Business Process Execution Language (BPEL);while superseding a mapping of BPMN to BPEL. Nonetheless; a mapping of BPEL toxBPMN is crucial with respect to applicability of the latter one.

Systems such as TensorFlow and MXNet train using synchronousstochastic gradient descent—an input batch is partitioned across the GPUs; each computinga partial gradient. The gradients are then combined to update the model parameters beforeproceeding to the next batch. For many deep learning models; this introduces a scalabilitychallenge: to keep multiple GPUs fully utilised; the batch size must be sufficiently large; but alarge batch size slows down model convergence due to the less frequent model updates;thus prolonging the time to reach a desired level of accuracy.

Pay-as-you-go Reconciliation in Schema Matching Networks,Nguyen Quoc; Viet Hung; Nguyen Thanh Tam; Karl Aberer; Avigdor Gal; Matthias Weidlich,Abstract—Schema matching is the process of establishing correspondences between theattributes of database schemas for data integration purposes. Although several automaticschema matching tools have been developed; their results are often incom-plete orerroneous. To obtain a correct set of correspondences; a human expert is usually required tovalidate the generated correspondences. We analyze this reconciliation process in a settingwhere a number of schemas needs to be matched; in the presence of consistencyexpectations about the network of attribute correspondences. We develop a probabilisticmodel that helps to identify the most uncertain correspondences; thus allowing us to guidethe expert's work and collect his input about the most problematic cases. As the availabilityof such experts is often limited; we develop techniques that can construct a set of good …,*,*,*

Discovery of arguments has a largepotential for informing decision-making. However; argument discovery is hindered by thesheer amount of available Web data and its unstructured; free-text representation. Theformer calls for automatic text-mining approaches; whereas the latter implies a need formanual processing to extract the structure of arguments.

In other words; context is the model of theenvironment that provides shared knowledge useful for the processes or event patterns athand. For instance; the currency of a financial transaction depends on the country in which aprocess or an event pattern is executed: abstracting the concept of currency and modelling itas part of the context can help to simplify the pattern or process definition; avoid duplicatedefinitions and terminology ambiguity and biases.

In recent years;various tools for automatic pair-wise matching of schemas have been developed. Since thematching process is inherently uncertain; the correspondences generated by such tools areoften validated by a human expert. In this work; we consider scenarios in which attributecorrespondences are identiﬁed in a network of schemas and not only in a pairwise setting.Here; correspondences between different schemas are interrelated; so that incomplete anderroneous matching results propagate in the network and the validation of acorrespondence by an expert has ripple effects. To analyse and reconcile such matchings inschema networks; we present the Schema Matching Analyzer and Reconciliation Tool …,*,*,*

Towards a Compendium of Process Technologies,Artem Polyvyanyy; Matthias Weidlich,Abstract. This paper presents the idea of a compendium of process technologies; ie; aconcise but comprehensive collection of techniques for process model analysis that supportresearch on the design; execution; and evaluation of processes. The idea originated fromobservations on the evolution of process-related research disciplines. Based on theseobservations; we derive design goals for a compendium. Then; we present the jBPT library;which addresses these goals by means of an implementation of common analysistechniques in an open source codebase.,*,*,*

Furthermore; models are becoming more and more importantas a communication tool across disciplines and enterprise roles. In particular understandabilityand readability of models is a key success factor for comprehensive modeling of enterprise practicesand IT systems. This entails the possibility of modeling different perspectives of theenterprise; and yet grant coherency and integration between the models … The CPSM 2013workshop was held as a multi-disciplinary forum for researchers and practitioners actively workingon quality; usability and maintainability of soft- ware and process models. The goal of the CPSMworkshop was to bring together researchers and practitioners in the area of Business Process(re)design and software maintenance; to discuss about and exchange ideas on quality …,*,*,*
On Leveraging Schema Matching Networks for Explorative Process Analysis,Avigdor Gal; Matthias Weidlich,Abstract. Business networks have a large potential of supporting their members in identifyingsynergies; building up consortia; and joining forces to react to legal changes. Hence;business networks should be equipped with an infrastructure supporting those goals.Bridging data heterogeneity and enabling interoperability of business documents in such asetting was recently addressed by schema matching networks. Matching in such a networkis guided by reusable building blocks; called concepts; that are shared by many networkmembers. We propose to adapt the notion of schema matching networks for an explorationof the business processes of network members. Then; a network consists of abstract processdescriptions and matching is guided by the business objects to which the activities refer.,*,*,*

Oryx–Prozessmodellierung im Web,Matthias Weidlich; Mathias Weske,Zusammenfassung In der Informatik dienen Modelle dazu; komplexe Sachverhalte einfachverständlich zu machen. Dazu abstrahiert man von unwichtigen Details und konzentriertsich auf das Wesentliche. Dieser Modellbegriff liegt auch der Prozessmodellierungzugrunde. Hier werden komplexe Abläufe in Unternehmen und Verwaltungen auf einfacheund verständliche Weise graphisch dargestellt und damit die Voraussetzung für dieVerbesserung der Prozesse geliefert. Mit Oryx stellen wir in diesem Beitrag ein System vor;mit dem Geschäftsprozesse in der BPMN; einer international standardisierten graphischenSprache einfach im Web modelliert werden können. Wir gehen kurz auf die technischeRealisierung ein und setzen das Hauptaugenmerk auf die Verwendung des Systems.Aufgrund der Offenheit von Oryx und der einfachen Bedienung und Installation sehen wir …,*,*,*
