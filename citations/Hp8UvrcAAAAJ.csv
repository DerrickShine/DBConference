SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ANALYZING STREAMS AND COUNTING STREAM ITEMS ON MULTI-CORE PROCESSORS,*,*,*,2007,29
On efficient query processing of stream counts on the cell processor,Dina Thomas; Rajesh Bordawekar; Charu C Aggarwal; Philip S Yu,In recent years; the sketch-based technique has been presented as an effective method forcounting stream items on processors with limited storage and processing capabilities; suchas the network processors. In this paper; we examine the implementation of a sketch-basedcounting algorithm on the heterogeneous multi-core Cell processor. Like the networkprocessors; the Cell also contains on-chip special processors with limited local memories.These special processors enable parallel processing of stream items using short-vector data-parallel (SIMD) operations. We demonstrate that the inaccuracies of the estimates computedby straightforward adaptations of current sketch-based counting approaches areexacerbated by increased inaccuracies in approximating counts of low frequency items; andby the inherent space limitations of the Cell processor. To address these concerns; we …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,21
Efficient guided symbolic reachability using reachability expressions,Dina Thomas; Supratik Chakraborty; Paritosh Pandya,Abstract Asynchronous systems consist of a set of transitions which are non-deterministicallychosen and executed. We present a theory of guiding symbolic reachability in such systemsby scheduling clusters of transitions. A theory of reachability expressions which specify theschedules is presented. This theory allows proving equivalence of different schedules whichmay have radically different performance in BDD-based search. We present experimentalevidence to show that optimized reachability expressions give rise to significantperformance advantages. The profiling is carried out in the NuSMV framework usingexamples from discrete timed automata and circuits with delays. A variant tool called NuSMV-DP has been developed for interpreting reachability expressions to carry out theexperiments.,Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,2006,17
Detailed protein sequence alignment based on Spectral Similarity Score (SSS),Kshitiz Gupta; Dina Thomas; SV Vidya; KV Venkatesh; Suryanarayanarao Ramakumar,The chemical property and biological function of a protein is a direct consequence of itsprimary structure. Several algorithms have been developed which determine alignment andsimilarity of primary protein sequences. However; character based similarity cannot provideinsight into the structural aspects of a protein. We present a method based on spectralsimilarity to compare subsequences of amino acids that behave similarly but are not alignedwell by considering amino acids as mere characters. This approach finds a similarity scorebetween sequences based on any given attribute; like hydrophobicity of amino acids; on thebasis of spectral information after partial conversion to the frequency domain. Distancematrices of various branches of the human kinome; that is the full complement of humankinases; were developed that matched the phylogenetic tree of the human kinome …,BMC bioinformatics,2005,14

A Frequency-aware Parallel Algorithm for Counting Stream Items on Multicore Processors,Dina Thomas; Rajesh Bordawekar; Charu Aggarwal; Philip S Yu,ABSTRACT We present a parallel counting algorithm for estimating frequencies of itemsfrom data streams where a stream is ingested and queried in parallel by partitioning dataover multiple processing cores of a multi-core processor. We demonstrate that currentprobabilistic counting algorithms are illsuited to be used as the sequential kernel in theparallel algorithm due to space limitations; inaccuracies in approximating counts of lowfrequency items; and inability to identify the absent items in a stream. To address theseconcerns; we have devised a new sequential counting algorithm; called the Frequency-aware Counting Algorithm (FCM). FCM is related to the Cormode-Muthukrishnan Count-Minalgorithm and incorporates novel capabilities for improving accuracy in estimating low-frequency items by dynamically capturing frequency changes of items in the stream; and …,*,*,*
