Using deep learning to enhance cancer diagnosis and classification,Rasool Fakoor; Faisal Ladhak; Azade Nazi; Manfred Huber,Abstract Using automated computer tools and in particular machine learning to facilitate andenhance medical analysis and diagnosis is a promising and important area. In this paper;we show that how unsupervised feature learning can be used for cancer detection andcancer type analysis from gene expression data. The main advantage of the proposedmethod over previous cancer detection approaches is the possibility of applying data fromvarious types of cancer to automatically form features which help to enhance the detectionand diagnosis of a specific one. The technique is here applied to the detection andclassification of cancer types based on gene expression data. In this domain we show thatthe performance of this method is better than that of previous methods; therefore promising amore comprehensive and generic approach for cancer detection and diagnosis.,The 30th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2013); WHEALTH Workshop,2013,88
An integrated cloud-based framework for mobile phone sensing,Rasool Fakoor; Mayank Raj; Azade Nazi; Mario Di Francesco; Sajal K Das,Abstract Nowadays mobile phones are not only communication devices; but also a source ofrich sensory data that can be collected and exploited by distributed people-centric sensingapplications. Among them; environmental monitoring and emergency response systems canparticularly benefit from people-based sensing. Due to the limited resources of mobiledevices; sensed data are usually offloaded to the cloud. However; state-of-the art solutionslack a unified approach suitable to support diverse applications; while reducing the energyconsumption of the mobile device. In this paper; we specifically address mobile devices asrich sources of multi-modal data collected by users. In this context; we propose an integratedframework for storing; processing and delivering sensed data to people-centric applicationsdeployed in the cloud. Our integrated platform is the foundation of a new delivery model …,Proceedings of the first edition of the MCC workshop on Mobile cloud computing,2012,21
Walk; Not Wait: Faster Sampling Over Online Social Networks,Azade Nazi; Zhuojie Zhou; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,Abstract In this paper; we introduce a novel; general purpose; technique for faster samplingof nodes over an online social network. Specifically; unlike traditional random walks whichwait for the convergence of sampling distribution to a predetermined target distribution-awaiting process that incurs a high query cost-we develop WALK-ESTIMATE; which startswith a much shorter random walk; and then proactively estimate the sampling probability forthe node taken before using acceptance-rejection sampling to adjust the samplingprobability to the predetermined target distribution. We present a novel backward randomwalk technique which provides provably unbiased estimations for the sampling probability;and demonstrate the superiority of WALK-ESTIMATE over traditional random walks throughtheoretical analysis and extensive experiments over real world online social networks.,*,2014,15
Deployment of robust wireless sensor networks using gene regulatory networks: An isomorphism-based approach,Azade Nazi; Mayank Raj; Mario Di Francesco; Preetam Ghosh; Sajal K Das,Abstract The communication between nodes in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) may faildue to different factors; such as hardware malfunctions; energy depletion; temporalvariations of the wireless channel and interference. To maximize efficiency; the sensornetwork deployment must be robust and resilient to such failures. One effective solution tothis problem is to exploit a bio-inspired approach based on Gene Regulatory Networks(GRNs). Owing to million years of evolution; GRNs display intrinsic properties of adaptationand robustness; thus making them suitable for dynamic network environments. In this article;we exploit the genetic structure of real organisms to deploy bio-inspired WSNs that areisomorphic to certain GRN sub-networks.

Efficient communications in wireless sensor networks based on biological robustness,Azade Nazi; Mayank Raj; Mario Di Francesco; Preetam Ghosh; Sajal K Das,Robustness in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a critical factor that largely depends ontheir network topology and on how devices can react to disruptions; including node and linkfailures. This article presents a novel solution to obtain robust WSNs by exploiting principlesof biological robustness at nanoscale. Specifically; we consider Gene Regulatory Networks(GRNs) as a model for the interaction between genes in living organisms. GRNs haveevolved over millions of years to provide robustness against adverse factors in cells andtheir environment. Based on this observation; we apply a method to build robust WSNs;called bio-inspired WSNs; by establishing a correspondence between the topology of GRNsand that of already-deployed WSNs. Through simulation in realistic conditions; wedemonstrate that bio-inspired WSNs are more reliable than existing solutions for the …,Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems (DCOSS); 2016 International Conference on,2016,4
Exploiting gene regulatory networks for robust wireless sensor networking,Azade Nazi; Mayank Raj; Mario Di Francesco; Preetam Ghosh; Sajal K Das,Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) represent the interactions of genes in living organisms;which have evolved over millions of years to provide a near-optimal structure for rapidadaptation to the environment. On the other hand; robustness in wireless sensor networks(WSNs) is a critical factor that largely depends on their topology and how quickly the networkcan recover from node and link failures. This article proposes a novel approach to designrobust WSNs by exploiting GRNs. Specifically; we build bio-inspired WSNs based on thetopology of GRNs. Our approach embeds the physical communication graph of the WSN intothe GRN graph under the optimization criterion of minimizing the interference betweendifferent nodes. Furthermore; we propose an algorithm to identify data collection points (ie;sinks) and improve robustness by maximizing the expansion of the network.

Query hidden attributes in social networks,Azade Nazi; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Vagelis Hristidis; Nan Zhang; Khaled Shaban; Gautam Das,Microblogs and collaborative content sites such as Twitter and Amazon are popular amongmillions of users who generate huge numbers of tweets; posts; and reviews every day.Despite their popularity; these sites only provide rudimentary mechanisms to navigate theirsites; programmatically or through a browser; like a keyword search interface or a get-neighbors (eg; Friends) interface. Many interesting queries cannot be directly answered byany of these interfaces; eg; Find Twitter users in Los Angeles that have tweeted the word"diabetes" in the last year. Note that the Twitter programming interface does not allowconditions on the user's home location. In this paper; we introduce the novel problem ofquerying hidden attributes in micro blogs and collaborative content sites by leveraging theexisting search mechanisms offered by those sites. We model these data sources as …,Data Mining Workshop (ICDMW); 2014 IEEE International Conference on,2014,4
Efficient Computation of Regret-ratio Minimizing Set: A Compact Maxima Representative,Abolfazl Asudeh; Azade Nazi; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,Abstract Finding the maxima of a database based on a user preference; especially when theranking function is a linear combination of the attributes; has been the subject of recentresearch. A critical observation is that the em convex hull is the subset of tuples that can beused to find the maxima of any linear function. However; in real world applications theconvex hull can be a significant portion of the database; and thus its performance is greatlyreduced. Thus; computing a subset limited to $ r $ tuples that minimizes the regret ratio (ameasure of the user's dissatisfaction with the result from the limited set versus the one fromthe entire database) is of interest. In this paper; we make several fundamental theoretical aswell as practical advances in developing such a compact set.

Answering Complex Queries in an Online Community Network.,Azade Nazi; Saravanan Thirumuruganathan; Vagelis Hristidis; Nan Zhang; Gautam Das,Abstract An online community network such as Twitter or amazon. com links entities (eg;users; products) with various relationships (eg; friendship; co-purchase) and make suchinformation available for access through a web interface. The web interfaces of thesenetworks often support features such as keyword search and “getneighbors”-so a visitor canquickly find entities (eg; users/products) of interest. Nonetheless; the interface is usually toorestrictive to answer complex queries such as (1) find 100 Twitter users from California withat least 100 followers who talked about ICWSM last year or (2) find 100 books with at least200 5-star reviews at amazon. com. In this paper; we introduce the novel problem ofanswering complex queries that involve nonsearchable attributes through the web interfaceof an online community network.

Though a significant proportion of purchasing decisions are driven by averagerating; detailed reviews are critical for activities like buying expensive digital SLR camera.Since writing a detailed review for an item is usually time-consuming; the number of reviewsavailable in the Web is far from many. Given a user and an item our goal is to identify the top-$ k $ meaningful phrases/tags to help her review the item easily.

MobiFace: A Mobile Application for Faceted Search over Hidden Web Databases,Azade Nazi; Abolfazl Asudeh; Gautam Das; Nan Zhang; Ali Jaoua,A large number of web databases are hidden behind form-based interfaces (consisting ofinterface components such as textboxes; drop-down boxes; etc) for users to enter theirdesired values in a search query. Form-based interfaces are not always easy to use anderror-prone on mobile devices; mainly because of limitations such as smaller screen; trickiertext input; etc. We build MobiFace which is a faceted search system over a hidden databasefor mobile users. The goal of our system is to help a user to find her tuple of interest with asfewer questions as possible. MobiFace dynamically suggests facets for drilling down into thehidden web database such that the navigation cost is minimized.

Assisting Service Providers In Peer-to-peer Marketplaces: Maximizing Gain Over Flexible Attributes,Abolfazl Asudeh; Azade Nazi; Nick Koudas; Gautam Das,Abstract: Peer to peer marketplaces such as AirBnB enable transactional exchange ofservices directly between people. In such platforms; those providing a service (hosts inAirBnB) are faced with various choices. For example in AirBnB; although some amenities ina property (attributes of the property) are fixed; others are relatively flexible and can beprovided without significant effort. Providing an amenity is usually associated with a cost.Naturally different sets of amenities may have a different``gains''(monetary or otherwise) fora host. Consequently; given a limited budget; deciding which amenities (attributes) to offer ischallenging. In this paper; we formally introduce and define the problem of {\em GainMaximization over Flexible Attributes}(GMFA). We first prove that the problem is NP-hardand show that identifying an approximate algorithm with a constant approximate ratio is …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.03028,2017,*
Exploratory Data Analysis over Online Community Networks,Azade Nazi,An online community network links entities (eg; users; products) with various relationships(eg; friendship; co-purchase) and make such information available for access through a webinterface. There are numerous such networks on the web; ranging from Twitter; Instagram;which links users as``followers-followees''; to amazon. com; ebay. com; which links productswith relationships such as``also buy''. Online community networks often feature a webinterface that only allows local-neighborhood queries-ie; given a entity (eg; users; products)of the community network as input; the system only returns the immediate neighbors of theentity. Further; the rate limit constraint restricts the number of queries/API calls that could beissued per day over the online community networks. These restrictives makes it extremelydifficult for a third party to crawl all data from a community network; as a complete crawl …,*,2016,*
Privacy Preserving Query Answering in Peer Data Management Systems,Azade Nazi; Donggang Liu; Sajal K Das,Peer Data Management Systems (PDMS) provide data sharing between heterogeneousdatabases using peer-to-peer schema mapping; where intermediate peers are used totranslate the queries as well as the query results. However; such translation leaks not onlythe exchanged data but also the private mapping information used by intermediate peers fortranslation. The privacy of such information is critical in most applications; specially inhealthcare. Researchers have proposed to inject dummy values into the query result toconfuse the adversary. However; existing solutions overlooked the privacy of the exchangedquery. Furthermore; they can only provide partial privacy for the private mapping informationand are computationally expensive.

Robust Design of Wireless Sensor Networks using Gene Regulatory Networks,Azade Nazi,ABSTRACT Sensor nodes in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are responsible for sensingthe environment and propagating the collected data in the network. The communicationbetween sensor nodes may fail due to different factors; such as temporal variations of thewireless channel; interference; hardware failures; and energy depletion. Hence; robustdesign of WSNs in order to be resilient to such failures is an important challenge. In my work;I exploit real biological gene structure to design wireless sensor networks. More specifically;Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) of the real living organisms which has been evolved overmillions of years; display intrinsic properties of adaptation and robustness and make themsuitable for dynamic network environments. The main purpose of this work is to use therobust GRN topology as a template to design communication structure of the WSN. Hence …,*,*,*
