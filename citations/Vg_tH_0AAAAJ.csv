Fast and simple relational processing of uncertain data,Lyublena Antova; Thomas Jansen; Christoph Koch; Dan Olteanu,This paper introduces U-relations; a succinct and purely relational representation system foruncertain databases. U-relations support attribute-level uncertainty using verticalpartitioning. If we consider positive relational algebra extended by an operation forcomputing possible answers; a query on the logical level can be translated into; andevaluated as; a single relational algebra query on the U-relational representation. Thetranslation scheme essentially preserves the size of the query in terms of number ofoperations and; in particular; number of joins. Standard techniques employed in off-the-shelfrelational database management systems are effective for optimizing and processingqueries on U-relations. In our experiments we show that query evaluation on U-relationsscales to large amounts of data with high degrees of uncertainty.,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008.

$ ${10^{(10^{6})}} $ $ worlds and beyond: efficient representation and processing of incomplete information,Lyublena Antova; Christoph Koch; Dan Olteanu,Abstract We present a decomposition-based approach to managing probabilisticinformation. We introduce world-set decompositions (WSDs); a space-efficient and completerepresentation system for finite sets of worlds. We study the problem of efficiently evaluatingrelational algebra queries on world-sets represented by WSDs.

MayBMS: Managing incomplete information with probabilistic world-set decompositions,Lyublena Antova; Christoph Koch; Dan Olteanu,Managing incomplete information is important in many real world applications. In thisdemonstration we present MayBMS-a system for representing and managing finite sets ofpossible worlds-that successfully combines expressiveness and efficiency. Some features ofMayBMS are: completeness of the representation system for finite world-sets; space-efficientrepresentation of large world-sets; scalable evaluation and support for full relational algebraqueries; and probabilistic extension of the representation system and the query language.MayBMS is implemented on top of PostgreSQL. It models incomplete data using the so-called world-set decompositions (WSDs)(Ruggles et al.; 2004). For this demonstration; weintroduce a probabilistic extension of world-sets and WSDs; where worlds or correlationsbetween worlds have probabilities. The main idea underlying probabilistic WSDs is to use …,Data Engineering; 2007. ICDE 2007. IEEE 23rd International Conference on,2007,104
Harnessing the deep web: Present and future,Jayant Madhavan; Loredana Afanasiev; Lyublena Antova; Alon Halevy,Abstract: Over the past few years; we have built a system that has exposed large volumes ofDeep-Web content to Google. com users. The content that our system exposes contributes tomore than 1000 search queries per-second and spans over 50 languages and hundreds ofdomains. The Deep Web has long been acknowledged to be a major source of structureddata on the web; and hence accessing Deep-Web content has long been a problem ofinterest in the data management community. In this paper; we report on where we believethe Deep Web provides value and where it does not. We contrast two very differentapproaches to exposing Deep-Web content--the surfacing approach that we used; and thevirtual integration approach that has often been pursued in the data management literature.We emphasize where the values of each of the two approaches lie and caution against …,arXiv preprint arXiv:0909.1785,2009,101
From complete to incomplete information and back,Lyublena Antova; Christoph Koch; Dan Olteanu,Abstract Incomplete information arises naturally in numerous data managementapplications. Recently; several researchers have studied query processing in the context ofincomplete information. Most work has combined the syntax of a traditional query languagelike relational algebra with a nonstandard semantics such as certain or ranked possibleanswers. There are now also languages with special features to deal with uncertainty.However; to the standards of the data management community; to date no languageproposal has been made that can be considered a natural analog to SQL or relationalalgebra for the case of incomplete information. In this paper we propose such a language;World-set Algebra; which satisfies the robustness criteria and analogies to relational algebrathat we expect. The language supports the contemplation on alternatives and can thus …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2007,99
World-set decompositions: Expressiveness and efficient algorithms,Lyublena Antova; Christoph Koch; Dan Olteanu,Abstract Uncertain information is commonplace in real-world data management scenarios.An important challenge in this context is the ability to represent large sets of possibleinstances (worlds) while supporting efficient storage and processing. The recent formalismof world-set decompositions (WSDs) provides a space-efficient representation for uncertaindata that also supports scalable processing. WSDs are complete for finite world-sets in thatthey can represent any finite set of possible worlds. For possibly infinite world-sets; we showthat a natural generalization of WSDs precisely captures the expressive power of c-tables.We then show that several important problems are efficiently solvable on WSDs while theyare NP-hard on c-tables. Finally; we give a polynomial-time algorithm for factorizing WSDs;ie an efficient algorithm for minimizing such representations.,International Conference on Database Theory,2007,47

Optimizing queries over partitioned tables in MPP systems,Lyublena Antova; Amr El-Helw; Mohamed A Soliman; Zhongxian Gu; Michalis Petropoulos; Florian Waas,Abstract Partitioning of tables based on value ranges provides a powerful mechanism toorganize tables in database systems. In the context of data warehousing and large-scaledata analysis partitioned tables are of particular interest as the nature of queries favorsscanning large swaths of data. In this scenario; eliminating partitions from a query plan thatcontain data not relevant to answering a given query can represent substantial performanceimprovements. Dealing with partitioned tables in query optimization has attracted significantattention recently; yet; a number of challenges unique to Massively Parallel Processing(MPP) databases and their distributed nature remain unresolved.

On APIs for probabilistic databases,Lyublena Antova; Christoph Koch,Abstract. We study database application programming interfaces for uncertain andprobabilistic databases and present a programming model that is independent ofrepresentation details. Conceptually; we use the possible worlds semantics; and programsare independently evaluated in each world. We study a class of programs that appear to theuser as if they are running in a single world rather than on a set of possible worlds. Wepresent an algorithm for efficiently verifying this property. We discuss how updates can beimplemented in uncertain database management systems; and propose techniques foroptimizing database programs.,*,2008,9
Reversing statistics for scalable test databases generation,Entong Shen; Lyublena Antova,Abstract Testing the performance of database systems is commonly accomplished usingsynthetic data and workload generators such as TPC-H and TPC-DS. Customer data andworkloads are hard to obtain due to their sensitive nature and prohibitively large sizes. As aresult; oftentimes the data management systems are not properly tested before releasing;and performance-related bugs are commonly discovered after deployment; when the cost offixing is very high. In this paper we propose RSGen; an approach to generating datasets outof customer metadata information; including schema; integrity constraints and statistics.RSGen enables generation of data that closely matches the customer environment; and isfast; scalable and extensible.,Proceedings of the Sixth International Workshop on Testing Database Systems,2013,7

Automatic capture of minimal; portable; and executable bug repros using AMPERe,Lyublena Antova; Konstantinos Krikellas; Florian M Waas,Abstract Query optimizers are among the most complex software components in anydatabase system and are naturally prone to contain software defects. Despite significantefforts in quality assurance; customers occasionally encounter unexpected errors inproduction systems. A self-contained repro of the problem is often the best approach towarda speedy resolution of the issue. However; repros are notoriously difficult to obtain as theyrequire schema definition; the offending query; and potentially many other pieces of datathat are difficult to capture in a consistent and accurate way. As a result; query optimizerissues have a reputation of being hard to tackle and requiring dedicated resources andexceedingly long turnaround time to provide solution to the customer.

Datometry Hyper-Q: Bridging the Gap Between Real-Time and Historical Analytics,Lyublena Antova; Rhonda Baldwin; Derrick Bryant; Tuan Cao; Michael Duller; John Eshleman; Zhongxian Gu; Entong Shen; Mohamed A Soliman; F Michael Waas,Abstract Wall Street's trading engines are complex database applications written for timeseries databases like kdb+ that uses the query language Q to perform real-time analysis.Extending the models to include other data sources; eg; historic data; is critical forbacktesting and compliance. However; Q applications cannot run directly on SQLdatabases. Therefore; financial institutions face the dilemma of either maintaining twoseparate application stacks; one written in Q and the other in SQL; which means increasedIT cost and increased risk; or migrating all Q applications to SQL; which results in losing theinherent competitive advantage on Q real-time processing. Neither solution is desirable asboth alternatives are costly; disruptive; and suboptimal. In this paper we present Hyper-Q; adata virtualization plat-form that overcomes the chasm.

Objects register with a handler prior to use;and the handler pre-allocates sufficient buffer space to store each. Upon a crash; thehandler requests each object to serialize itself into the pre-allocated space; and captures therelevant information in a transactionally consistent way.

Efficient representation and processing of incomplete information,Lyublena Antova,Abstract Database systems often have to deal with incomplete information as the world theymodel is not always complete. This is a frequent case in data integration applications;scientific databases; or in scenarios where information is manually entered and containserrors or ambiguity. In the last couple of decades different formalisms have been proposedfor representing incomplete information. These include; among other; the socalled relationswith or-sets; tables with variables (v-tables) and conditional tables (c-tables). However; noneof the current approaches for representing incomplete information has satisfied therequirements for a powerful and efficient data management system; which is the reason whynone has found application in practice. All models generally suffer from at least one of twoweaknesses. Either they are not strong enough for representing results of simple queries …,*,2006,1

MayBMS: A Possible Worlds Base Management System,Lyublena Antova; Christoph Koch; Dan Olteanu,Incomplete information is frequent in real-world applications. This is often the case in dataintegration scenarios; in scientific data collections; or whenever the information is acquiredusing human interaction and is erroneous or imperfect. The different interpretations ofincomplete information yield different possible worlds. A system for managing incompletedata faces the challenge of being able to represent large sets of possible worlds compactly;while at the same time supporting efficient processing of the data. Nevertheless; there hasbeen little research so far into expressive yet scalable systems for managing incompleteinformation. Most current representation models have at least one of two flaws; some of them(such as or-set relations and v-tables) are not strong enough to represent query answerswithin the same formalism; and other (such as the c-tables) are strong enough but …,*,2006,*
