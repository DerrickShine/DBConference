HadoopDB: an architectural hybrid of MapReduce and DBMS technologies for analytical workloads,Azza Abouzeid; Kamil Bajda-Pawlikowski; Daniel Abadi; Avi Silberschatz; Alexander Rasin,Abstract The production environment for analytical data management applications is rapidlychanging. Many enterprises are shifting away from deploying their analytical databases onhigh-end proprietary machines; and moving towards cheaper; lower-end; commodityhardware; typically arranged in a shared-nothing MPP architecture; often in a virtualizedenvironment inside public or private" clouds". At the same time; the amount of data thatneeds to be analyzed is exploding; requiring hundreds to thousands of machines to work inparallel to perform the analysis. There tend to be two schools of thought regarding whattechnology to use for data analysis in such an environment. Proponents of paralleldatabases argue that the strong emphasis on performance and efficiency of paralleldatabases makes them well-suited to perform such analysis. On the other hand; others …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,1003

HadoopDB in action: building real world applications,Azza Abouzied; Kamil Bajda-Pawlikowski; Jiewen Huang; Daniel J Abadi; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract HadoopDB is a hybrid of MapReduce and DBMS technologies; designed to meetthe growing demand of analyzing massive datasets on very large clusters of machines. Ourprevious work has shown that HadoopDB approaches parallel databases in performanceand still yields the scalability and fault tolerance of MapReduce-based systems. In thisdemonstration; we focus on HadoopDB's flexible architecture and versatility with two realworld application scenarios: a semantic web data application for protein sequence analysisand a business data warehousing application based on TPC-H. The demonstration offers athorough walk-through of how to easily build applications on top of HadoopDB.,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,79

Learning and verifying quantified boolean queries by example,Azza Abouzied; Dana Angluin; Christos Papadimitriou; Joseph M Hellerstein; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract To help a user specify and verify quantified queries---a class of database queriesknown to be very challenging for all but the most expert users---one can question the useron whether certain data objects are answers or non-answers to her intended query. In thispaper; we analyze the number of questions needed to learn or verify qhorn queries; aspecial class of Boolean quantified queries whose underlying form is conjunctions ofquantified Horn expressions. We provide optimal polynomial-question and polynomial-timelearning and verification algorithms for two subclasses of the class qhorn with upperconstant limits on a query's causal density.,Proceedings of the 32nd ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI symposium on Principles of database systems,2013,39
Invisible loading: access-driven data transfer from raw files into database systems,Azza Abouzied; Daniel J Abadi; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract Commercial analytical database systems suffer from a high" time-to-first-analysis":before data can be processed; it must be modeled and schematized (a human effort);transferred into the database's storage layer; and optionally clustered and indexed (acomputational effort). For many types of structured data; this upfront effort is unjustifiable; sothe data are processed directly over the file system using the Hadoop framework; despite thecumulative performance benefits of processing this data in an analytical database system. Inthis paper we describe a system that achieves the immediate gratification of runningMapReduce jobs directly over a file system; while still making progress towards the long-term performance benefits of database systems. The basic idea is to piggyback onMapReduce jobs; leverage their parsing and tuple extraction operations to incrementally …,Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2013,38
DataPlay: interactive tweaking and example-driven correction of graphical database queries,Azza Abouzied; Joseph Hellerstein; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract Writing complex queries in SQL is a challenge for users. Prior work has developedseveral techniques to ease query specification but none of these techniques are applicableto a particularly difficult class of queries: quantified queries. Our hypothesis is that usersprefer to specify quantified queries interactively by trial-and-error. We identify twoimpediments to this form of interactive trial-and-error query specification in SQL:(i) changingquantifiers often requires global syntactical query restructuring; and (ii) the absence of non-answers from SQL's results makes verifying query correctness difficult. We remedy theseissues with DataPlay; a query tool with an underlying graphical query language; a uniquedata model and a graphical interface. DataPlay provides two interaction features thatsupport trial-and-error query specification. First; DataPlay allows users to directly …,Proceedings of the 25th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,2012,33

Playful query specification with DataPlay,Azza Abouzied; Joseph M Hellerstein; Avi Silberschatz,Abstract DataPlay is a query tool that encourages a trial-and-error approach to queryspecification. DataPlay uses a graphical query language to make a particularly challengingquery specification task-quantification-easier. It constrains the relational data model toenable the presentation of non-answers; in addition to answers; to aid query interpretation.Two novel features of DataPlay are suggesting semantic variations to a query and correctingqueries by example. We introduce DataPlay as a sophisticated query specification tool anddemonstrate its unique interaction models.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,25
CommonTies: a context-aware nudge towards social interaction,Azza Abouzied; Jay Chen,Abstract Urbanization has created transient; ethnically-varied; and densely-populatedcommunities where meaningful human contact is difficult. Urban social norms such as" civilinattention"---a deliberate display of unwillingness to become more familiar with strangers---discourage social interactions among strangers. While these norms help reduce anxiety orfear in overcrowded urban centers they hinder meaningful social interactions in publicspaces (coffee shops; museums; and malls; etc.) and events (conferences; galas; etc.)where such interactions should occur. This paper describes CommonTies; a simpletechnological nudge that managers of interaction spaces and organizers of social eventscan use to leverage contextual information to encourage social interactions amongstrangers.,Proceedings of the companion publication of the 17th ACM conference on Computer supported cooperative work & social computing,2014,14
Scalable package queries in relational database systems,Matteo Brucato; Juan Felipe Beltran; Azza Abouzied; Alexandra Meliou,Abstract Traditional database queries follow a simple model: they define constraints thateach tuple in the result must satisfy. This model is computationally efficient; as the databasesystem can evaluate the query conditions on each tuple individually. However; manypractical; real-world problems require a collection of result tuples to satisfy constraintscollectively; rather than individually. In this paper; we present package queries; a new querymodel that extends traditional database queries to handle complex constraints andpreferences over answer sets. We develop a full-fledged package query system;implemented on top of a traditional database engine. Our work makes several contributions.First; we design PaQL; a SQL-based query language that supports the declarativespecification of package queries.

The persistence of paper: a case study in microfinance from Ghana,Ishita Ghosh; Jay Chen; Joy Ming; Azza Abouzied,Abstract Paper as a medium persists as the de facto standard for information collection;storage; and transfer in many low-resource developing contexts. Of these contexts; themicrofinance industry continues to be fascinating in the ongoing ICTD conversation due; inpart; to its elimination of paper by digitizing money transfers using mobile banking. Thissuccess invites scholars; designers; and industry practitioners to design technologysolutions to eliminate the perceived inefficiencies of paper in microfinance and otherindustries. In this work; we take a step back to assess the role and value of paper in order togive designers pause when considering a blanket digitization of existing processes; norms;and transactions. Specifically; we study a microfinance ecosystem in the city of Tema inGhana and find that paper passbooks are able to deliver valuable context-specific …,Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies and Development,2015,8

While offering support and flexibility for organizers; crowdfunding sites provide very little control to donors. Inthis paper; we investigate the idea of empowering donors by allowing them to specify conditions for their crowdfunding contributions. We introduce a crowdfunding system; Codo; thatallows donors to spec ify conditional donations. Codo allow donors to contribute to acampaign but hold off on their contribution until certain specific conditions are met (egspecific members or groups contribute a certain amount). We begin with a micro study toassess several specific condi tional donations based on their comprehensibility and usagelikelihood.

PackageBuilder: From tuples to packages,Matteo Brucato; Rahul Ramakrishna; Azza Abouzied; Alexandra Meliou,Abstract In this demo; we present PackageBuilder; a system that extends database systemsto support package queries. A package is a collection of tuples that individually satisfy baseconstraints and collectively satisfy global constraints. The need for package support arises ina variety of scenarios: For example; in the creation of meal plans; users are not onlyinterested in the nutritional content of individual meals (base constraints); but also care tospecify daily consumption limits and control the balance of the entire plan (globalconstraints). We introduce PaQL; a declarative SQL-based package query language; andthe interface abstractions which allow users to interactively specify package queries andeasily navigate through their results. To efficiently evaluate queries; the system employspruning and heuristics; as well as state-of-the-art constraint optimization solvers. We …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,4

Don't Just Swipe Left; Tell Me Why: Enhancing Gesture-based Feedback with Reason Bins,Juan Felipe Beltran; Ziqi Huang; Azza Abouzied; Arnab Nandi,Abstract Despite several advances in information retrieval systems and user interfaces; thespecification of queries over text-based document collections remains a challengingproblem. Query specification with keywords is a popular solution. However; given thewidespread adoption of gesture-driven interfaces such as multitouch technologies insmartphones and tablets; the lack of a physical keyboard makes query specification withkeywords inconvenient. We present BinGO; a novel gestural approach to querying textdatabases that allows users to refine their queries using a swipe gesture to either" like" or"dislike" candidate documents as well as express the reasons they like or dislike a documentby swiping through automatically generated" reason bins". Such reasons refine a user'squery with additional keywords. We present an online and efficient bin generation …,Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces,2017,3
Synthesizing extraction rules from user examples with seer,Maeda F Hanafi; Azza Abouzied; Laura Chiticariu; Yunyao Li,Abstract Our demonstration showcases SEER's end-to-end Information Extraction (IE)workflow where users highlight texts they wish to extract. Given a small set of user-specifiedexample extractions; SEER synthesizes easy-to-understand IE rules and suggests them tothe user. In addition to rule suggestions; users can quickly pick the desired rule by filteringthe rule suggestion by accepting or rejecting proposed extractions. SEER's workflow allowsusers to jump start the IE rule development cycle; it is a less time-consuming alternative tomachine learning methods that require large labeled datasets or rule-based approachesthat are labor-intensive. SEER's design principles and learning algorithm are motivated byhow rule developers naturally construct data extraction rules.,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,2017,1
Seer: Auto-generating information extraction rules from user-specified examples,Maeda F Hanafi; Azza Abouzied; Laura Chiticariu; Yunyao Li,Abstract Time-consuming and complicated best describe the current state of the InformationExtraction (IE) field. Machine learning approaches to IE require large collections of labeleddatasets that are difficult to create and use obscure mathematical models; occasionallyreturning unwanted results that are unexplainable. Rule-based approaches; while resultingin easy-to-understand IE rules; are still time-consuming and labor-intensive. SEERcombines the best of these two approaches: a learning model for IE rules based on a smallnumber of user-specified examples. In this paper; we explain the design behind SEER andpresent a user study comparing our system against a commercially available tool in whichusers create IE rules manually. Our results show that SEER helps users complete textextraction tasks more quickly; as well as more accurately.,Proceedings of the 2017 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2017,1
Harnessing data loss with forgetful data structures,Azza Abouzied; Jay Chen,Abstract Forgetting; losing; or corrupting data is almost universally considered harmful incomputer science and blasphemous in database and file systems. Typically; loss of data is aconsequence of unmanageable or unexpected lower layer deficiencies that the userprocess must be protected from through multiple layers of storage abstractions andredundancies. We argue that forgetfulness can be a resource for system design and that;like durability; security or integrity; can be used to achieve uncommon; but potentiallyimportant goals such as privacy; plausible deniability; and the right to be forgotten. Wedefine the key properties of forgetfulness and draw inspiration from human memory. Wedevelop a data structure; the forgit; that can be used to store images; audio files; videos ornumerical data and eventually forget.

This isparticularly true for quantified queries—a class of database queries known to be verychallenging for all but the most expert users.

Shelter Dynamics in Refugee and IDP Camps: Customization; Permanency; and Opportunities,Samar Sabie; Jay Chen; Azza Abouzied; Fatma Hashim; Harleen Kahlon; Steve Easterbrook,Abstract The UNHCR estimates that the average forced displacement period is 17 years;which many refugees and IDPs (Internally Displaced Persons) spend entirely in camps. Thisreality has caused camps to be increasingly considered as permanent cities of our futurerather than temporary relief solutions. Unfortunately; this recognition has not been matchedby corresponding increases in the planning or resources devoted to camps. In the case ofshelter; a basic human need; little to no architectural infrastructure exists and urban planningremains short-term. As a result; camp dwellers are often forced to take it upon themselves totransform existing humanitarian storage facilities into essential domiciles; markets; andcommunities.

Redistributing Funds across Charitable Crowdfunding Campaigns,Matteo Brucato; Azza Abouzied; Chris Blauvelt,Abstract: On Kickstarter only 36% of crowdfunding campaigns successfully raise sufficientfunds for their projects. In this paper; we explore the possibility of redistribution ofcrowdfunding donations to increase the chances of success. We define several intuitiveredistribution policies and; using data from a real crowdfunding platform; LaunchGood; weassess the potential improvement in campaign fundraising success rates. We find that anaggressive redistribution scheme can boost campaign success rates from 37% to 79%; butsuch choice-agnostic redistribution schemes come at the cost of disregarding donorpreferences. Taking inspiration from offline giving societies and donor clubs; we build a casefor choice preserving redistribution schemes that strike a balance between increasing thenumber of successful campaigns and respecting giving preference.

A Scalable Execution Engine for Package Queries,Matteo Brucato; Azza Abouzied; Alexandra Meliou,Abstract Many modern applications and real-world problems involve the design of itemcollections; or packages: from planning your daily meals all the way to mapping theuniverse. Despite the pervasive need for packages; traditional data management does notoffer support for their definition and computation. This is because traditional databasequeries follow a powerful; but very simple model: a query defines constraints that each tuplein the result must satisfy. However; a system tasked with the design of packages cannotconsider items independently; rather; the system needs to determine if a set of itemscollectively satisfy given criteria. In this paper; we present package queries; a new querymodel that extends traditional database queries to handle complex constraints andpreferences over answer sets.

From Alley to Landfill: Challenges of and Design Opportunities for Cleaning Dhaka's Communal Trash,Md Rashidujjaman Rifat; Aysha Siddique; Azza Abouzied; Jay Chen,Abstract Garbage is an endemic problem in developing cities due to the continual influx ofmigrants from rural areas coupled with deficient municipal capacity planning. In cities likeDhaka; open waste dumps contribute to the prevalence of disease; environmentalcontamination; catastrophic flooding; and deadly fires. Recent interest in the garbageproblem has prompted cursory proposals to introduce technology solutions for mapping andfundraising. Yet; the role of technology and its potential benefits are unexplored in this large-scale problem. In this paper; we contribute to the understanding of the waste ecology inDhaka and how the various actors acquire; perform; negotiate; and coordinate their roles.Within this context; we explore design opportunities for using computing technologies tosupport collaboration between waste pickers and residents of these communities.

In many cases; users are interested in package recommendations as collections ofitems. For example; a dietitian may wish to derive a dietary plan as a collection of recipesthat is nutritionally balanced; and a travel agent may want to produce a vacation package asa coordinated collection of travel and hotel reservations. Recent work has exploredextending recommendation systems to support packages of items.

PackageBuilder: Querying for packages of tuples,Kevin Fernandes; Matteo Brucato; Rahul Ramakrishna; Azza Abouzied; Alexandra Meliou,Abstract PackageBuilder is a system that extends query engines to support packagegeneration. A package is a collection of tuples with certain global properties defined on thecollection as a whole. In contrast to traditional query answers where each answer tupleneeds to satisfy the query predicates; each answer package needs to satisfy globalconstraints on the collection of tuples: eg; a package of recipes that collectively do notexceed 2;200 calories.
