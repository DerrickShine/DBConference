New Algorithms for Fast Discovery of Association Rules.,Mohammed Javeed Zaki; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Mitsunori Ogihara; Wei Li,Abstract Discovery of association rules is an important problem in database mining. In thispaper we present new algorithms for fast association mining; which scan the database onlyonce; addressing the open question whether all the rules can be efficiently extracted in asingle database pass. The algorithms use novel itemset clustering techniques toapproximate the set of potentially maximal frequent itemsets. The algorithms then make useof efficient lattice traversal techniques to generate the frequent itemsets contained in eachcluster. We propose two clustering schemes based on equivalence classes and maximalhypergraph cliques; and study two traversal techniques based on bottom-up and hybridsearch. We also use a vertical database layout to cluster related transactions together.Experimental results show improvements of over an order of magnitude compared to …,KDD,1997,1439
An event-based framework for characterizing the evolutionary behavior of interaction graphs,Sitaram Asur; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Duygu Ucar,Abstract Interaction graphs are ubiquitous in many fields such as bioinformatics; sociologyand physical sciences. There have been many studies in the literature targeted at studyingand mining these graphs. However; almost all of them have studied these graphs from astatic point of view. The study of the evolution of these graphs over time can providetremendous insight on the behavior of entities; communities and the flow of informationamong them. In this work; we present an event-based characterization of critical behavioralpatterns for temporally varying interaction graphs. We use nonoverlapping snapshots ofinteraction graphs and develop a framework for capturing and identifying interesting eventsfrom them. We use these events to characterize complex behavioral patterns of individualsand communities over time. We show how semantic information can be incorporated to …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2009,390
Parallel algorithms for discovery of association rules,Mohammed J Zaki; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Mitsunori Ogihara; Wei Li; Paul Stolorz; Ron Musick,Abstract Discovery of association rules is an important data mining task. Several parallel andsequential algorithms have been proposed in the literature to solve this problem. Almost allof these algorithms make repeated passes over the database to determine the set offrequent itemsets (a subset of database items); thus incurring high I/O overhead. In theparallel case; most algorithms perform a sum-reduction at the end of each pass to constructthe global counts; also incurring high synchronization cost. In this paper we describe newparallel association mining algorithms. The algorithms use novel itemset clusteringtechniques to approximate the set of potentially maximal frequent itemsets. Once this set hasbeen identified; the algorithms make use of efficient traversal techniques to generate thefrequent itemsets contained in each cluster. We propose two clustering schemes based …,*,1997,332
Minimizing broadcast latency and redundancy in ad hoc networks,Rajiv Gandhi; Arunesh Mishra; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Network wide broadcasting is a fundamental operation in ad hoc networks. Inbroadcasting; a source node sends a message to all the other nodes in the network. In thispaper; we consider the problem of collision-free broadcasting in ad hoc networks. Ourobjective is to minimize the latency and the number of transmissions in the broadcast. Weshow that minimum latency broadcasting is NP-complete for ad hoc networks. We alsopresent a simple distributed collision-free broadcasting algorithm for broadcasting amessage. For networks with bounded node transmission ranges; our algorithmsimultaneously guarantees that the latency and the number of transmissions are within O (1)times their respective optimal values. Our algorithm and analysis extend to the case whenmultiple messages are broadcast from multiple sources. Experimental studies indicate …,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON),2008,313
Incremental and interactive sequence mining,Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Mohammed Javeed Zaki; Mitsunori Ogihara; Sandhya Dwarkadas,Abstract The discovery of frequent sequences in temporal databases is an important datamining problem. Most current work assumes that the database is static; and a databaseupdate requires rediscovering all the patterns by scanning the entire old and new database.In this paper; we propose novel techniques for maintaining sequences in the presence of a)database updates; and b) user interaction (eg modifying mining parameters). This is a verychallenging task; since such updates can invalidate existing sequences or introduce newones. In both the above scenarios; we avoid re-executing the algorithm on the entire dataset;thereby reducing execution time. Experimental results confirm that our approach results inexecution time improvements of up to several orders of magnitude in practice.,Proceedings of the eighth international conference on Information and knowledge management,1999,303
Customized dynamic load balancing for a network of workstations,Mohammed Javeed Zaki; Wei Li; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Load balancing involves assigning to each processor work proportional to its performance;minimizing the execution time of the program. Although static load balancing can solvemany problems (eg; those caused by processor heterogeneity and non uniform loops) formost regular applications; the transient external load due to multiple users on a network ofworkstations necessitates a dynamic approach to load balancing. We examine the behaviorof global vs. local; and centralized vs. distributed; load balancing strategies. We show thatdifferent schemes are best for different applications under varying program and systemparameters. Therefore; customized load balancing schemes become essential for goodperformance. We present a hybrid compile time and run time modeling and decision processwhich selects (customizes) the best scheme; along with automatic generation of parallel …,High Performance Distributed Computing; 1996.; Proceedings of 5th IEEE International Symposium on,1996,298
Algorithmic aspects of capacity in wireless networks,VS Kumar; Madhav V Marathe; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Aravind Srinivasan,Abstract This paper considers two inter-related questions:(i) Given a wireless ad-hocnetwork and a collection of source-destination pairs {(si; ti)}; what is the maximumthroughput capacity of the network; ie the rate at which data from the sources to theircorresponding destinations can be transferred in the network?(ii) Can network protocols bedesigned that jointly route the packets and schedule transmissions at rates close to themaximum throughput capacity? Much of the earlier work focused on random instances andproved analytical lower and upper bounds on the maximum throughput capacity. Here; incontrast; we consider arbitrary wireless networks. Further; we study the algorithmic aspectsof the above questions: the goal is to design provably good algorithms for arbitraryinstances.

Akselrod et al.,This book presents an integrated collection of representative approaches for scaling upmachine learning and data mining methods on parallel and distributed computing platforms.Demand for parallelizing learning algorithms is highly task-specific: in some settings it isdriven by the enormous dataset sizes; in others by model complexity or by real-timeperformance requirements.

Evaluation of sampling for data mining of association rules,Mohammed Javeed Zaki; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Wei Li; Mitsunori Ogihara,The discovery of association rules is a prototypical problem in data mining. The currentalgorithms proposed for data mining of association rules make repeated passes over thedatabase to determine the commonly occurring item sets (or set of items). For largedatabases; the I/O overhead in scanning the database can be extremely high. The authorsshow that random sampling of transactions in the database is an effective method for findingassociation rules. Sampling can speed up the mining process by more than an order ofmagnitude by reducing I/O costs and drastically shrinking the number of transactions to beconsidered. They may also be able to make the sampled database resident in main-memory. Furthermore; they show that sampling can accurately represent the data patterns inthe database with high confidence.

Local probabilistic models for link prediction,Chao Wang; Venu Satuluri; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,One of the core tasks in social network analysis is to predict the formation of links (ie varioustypes of relationships) over time. Previous research has generally represented the socialnetwork in the form of a graph and has leveraged topological and semantic measures ofsimilarity between two nodes to evaluate the probability of link formation. Here we introducea novel local probabilistic graphical model method that can scale to large graphs to estimatethe joint co-occurrence probability of two nodes. Such a probability measure capturesinformation that is not captured by either topological measures or measures of semanticsimilarity; which are the dominant measures used for link prediction. We demonstrate theeffectiveness of the co-occurrence probability feature by using it both in isolation and incombination with other topological and semantic features for predicting co-authorship …,Data Mining; 2007.

Fast distributed outlier detection in mixed-attribute data sets,Matthew Eric Otey; Amol Ghoting; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Efficiently detecting outliers or anomalies is an important problem in many areas ofscience; medicine and information technology. Applications range from data cleaning toclinical diagnosis; from detecting anomalous defects in materials to fraud and intrusiondetection. Over the past decade; researchers in data mining and statistics have addressedthe problem of outlier detection using both parametric and non-parametric approaches in acentralized setting. However; there are still several challenges that must be addressed. First;most approaches to date have focused on detecting outliers in a continuous attribute space.However; almost all real-world data sets contain a mixture of categorical and continuousattributes. Categorical attributes are typically ignored or incorrectly modeled by existingapproaches; resulting in a significant loss of information. Second; there have not been …,Data mining and knowledge discovery,2006,229
Cashmere-2L: Software coherent shared memory on a clustered remote-write network,Robert Stets; Sandhya Dwarkadas; Nikolaos Hardavellas; Galen Hunt; Leonidas Kontothanassis; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Michael Scott,Abstract Low-latency remote-write networks; such as DEC's Memory Channel; provide thepossibility of transparent; inexpensive; huge-scale shared-memory parallel computing onclusters of shared memory multiprocessors (SMPs). The challenge is to take advantage ofhardwaresharedmemoryfor sharing within an SMI: and to ensure that software overheadisincurredonly when actively sharing data across SMPs in the cluster.

Scalable graph clustering using stochastic flows: applications to community discovery,Venu Satuluri; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Algorithms based on simulating stochastic flows are a simple and natural solutionfor the problem of clustering graphs; but their widespread use has been hampered by theirlack of scalability and fragmentation of output. In this article we present a multi-levelalgorithm for graph clustering using flows that delivers significant improvements in bothquality and speed. The graph is first successively coarsened to a manageable size; and asmall number of iterations of flow simulation is performed on the coarse graph. The graph isthen successively refined; with flows from the previous graph used as initializations for briefflow simulations on each of the intermediate graphs. When we reach the final refined graph;the algorithm is run to convergence and the high-flow regions are clustered together; withregions without any flow forming the natural boundaries of the clusters.

Fast mining of distance-based outliers in high-dimensional datasets,Amol Ghoting; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Matthew Eric Otey,Abstract Defining outliers by their distance to neighboring data points has been shown to bean effective non-parametric approach to outlier detection. In recent years; many researchefforts have looked at developing fast distance-based outlier detection algorithms. Several ofthe existing distance-based outlier detection algorithms report log-linear time performanceas a function of the number of data points on many real low-dimensional datasets. However;these algorithms are unable to deliver the same level of performance on high-dimensionaldatasets; since their scaling behavior is exponential in the number of dimensions. In thispaper; we present RBRP; a fast algorithm for mining distance-based outliers; particularlytargeted at high-dimensional datasets. RBRP scales log-linearly as a function of the numberof data points and linearly as a function of the number of dimensions. Our empirical …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2008,203
Parallel data mining for association rules on shared-memory multi-processors,Mohammed Javeed Zaki; Mitsunori Ogihara; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Wei Li,Data mining is an emerging research area; whose goal is to extract significant patterns orinteresting rules from databases. High-level inference from large volumes of routinebusiness data can provide valuable information to businesses; such as customer buyingpatterns; shelving criterion in supermarkets and stock trends.

Parallel data mining for association rules on shared-memory systems,Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Mohammed Javeed Zaki; Mitsunori Ogihara; Wei Li,Abstract. In this paper we present a new parallel algorithm for data mining of associationrules on shared-memory multiprocessors. We study the degree of parallelism;synchronization; and data locality issues; and present optimizations for fast frequencycomputation. Experiments show that a significant improvement of performance is achievedusing our proposed optimizations. We also achieved good speed-up for the parallelalgorithm. A lot of data-mining tasks (eg association rules; sequential patterns) use complexpointer-based data structures (eg hash trees) that typically suffer from suboptimal datalocality. In the multiprocessor case shared access to these data structures may also result infalse sharing. For these tasks it is commonly observed that the recursive data structure isbuilt once and accessed multiple times during each iteration.

An ensemble framework for clustering protein–protein interaction networks,Sitaram Asur; Duygu Ucar; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Motivation: Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) networks are believed to be importantsources of information related to biological processes and complex metabolic functions ofthe cell. The presence of biologically relevant functional modules in these networks hasbeen theorized by many researchers. However; the application of traditional clusteringalgorithms for extracting these modules has not been successful; largely due to thepresence of noisy false positive interactions as well as specific topological challenges in thenetwork. Results: In this article; we propose an ensemble clustering framework to addressthis problem. For base clustering; we introduce two topology-based distance metrics tocounteract the effects of noise.

Scalable trigger processing,Eric N Hanson; Chris Carnes; Lan Huang; Mohan Konyala; Lloyd Noronha; Sashi Parthasarathy; JB Park; Albert Vernon,Current database trigger systems have extremely limited scalability. This paper proposes away to develop a truly scalable trigger system. Scalability to large numbers of triggers isachieved with a trigger cache to use the main memory effectively; and a memory-conservingselection predicate index based on the use of unique expression formats called expressionsignatures. A key observation is that if a very large number of triggers are created; many willhave the same structure; except for the appearance of different constant values. When atrigger is created; tuples are added to special relations created for expression signatures tohold the trigger's constants. These tables can be augmented with a database index or main-memory index structure to serve as a predicate index. The design presented also uses anumber of types of concurrency to achieve scalability; including token (tuple)-level …,Data Engineering; 1999. Proceedings.; 15th International Conference on,1999,166

We show various ways of combining this technique withother ideas; leading to improved (approximation) algorithms for various problems. Theseinclude:---low congestion multi-path routing;---richer random-graph models for graphs with agiven degree-sequence;---improved approximation algorithms for:(i) throughput-maximization in broadcast scheduling;(ii) delay-minimization in broadcast scheduling; aswell as (iii) capacitated vertex cover; and---fair scheduling of jobs on unrelated parallelmachines.,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2006,151
End-to-end packet-scheduling in wireless ad-hoc networks,VS Kumar; Madhav V Marathe; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Aravind Srinivasan,Abstract Packet-scheduling is a particular challenge in wireless networks due to interferencefrom nearby transmissions. A distance-2 interference model serves as a useful abstractionhere; and we study packet routing and scheduling under this model. The main focus of ourwork is the development of fully-distributed (decentralized) protocols. We presentpolylogarithmic/constant factor approximation algorithms for various families of disk graphs(which capture the geometric nature of wireless-signal propagation); as well as near-optimalapproximation algorithms for general graphs. The packet-scheduling work by L eighton;Maggs and Rao (Combinatorica; 1994) and a basic distributed coloring procedure; originallydue to Luby (J.

Efficient community detection in large networks using content and links,Yiye Ruan; David Fuhry; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract In this paper we discuss a very simple approach of combining content and linkinformation in graph structures for the purpose of community discovery; a fundamental taskin network analysis. Our approach hinges on the basic intuition that many networks containnoise in the link structure and that content information can help strengthen the communitysignal. This enables ones to eliminate the impact of noise (false positives and falsenegatives); which is particularly prevalent in online social networks and Web-scaleinformation networks. Specifically we introduce a measure of signal strength between twonodes in the network by fusing their link strength with content similarity. Link strength isestimated based on whether the link is likely (with high probability) to reside within acommunity. Content similarity is estimated through cosine similarity or Jaccard coefficient.,Proceedings of the 22nd international conference on World Wide Web,2013,134
Local graph sparsification for scalable clustering,Venu Satuluri; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Yiye Ruan,Abstract In this paper we look at how to sparsify a graph ie how to reduce the edgeset whilekeeping the nodes intact; so as to enable faster graph clustering without sacrificing quality.The main idea behind our approach is to preferentially retain the edges that are likely to bepart of the same cluster. We propose to rank edges using a simple similarity-based heuristicthat we efficiently compute by comparing the minhash signatures of the nodes incident to theedge. For each node; we select the top few edges to be retained in the sparsified graph.Extensive empirical results on several real networks and using four state-of-the-art graphclustering and community discovery algorithms reveal that our proposed approach realizesexcellent speedups (often in the range 10-50); with little or no deterioration in the quality ofthe resulting clusters. In fact; for at least two of the four clustering algorithms; our …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,133
Cross-layer latency minimization in wireless networks with SINR constraints,Deepti Chafekar; VS Kumar; Madhav V Marathe; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Aravind Srinivasan,Abstract Recently; there has been substantial interest in the design of cross-layer protocolsfor wireless networks. These protocols optimize certain performance metric (s) of interest (eglatency; energy; rate) by jointly optimizing the performance of multiple layers of the protocolstack. Algorithm designers often use geometric-graph-theoretic models for radio interferenceto design such cross-layer protocols. In this paper we study the problem of designing cross-layer protocols for multi-hop wireless networks using a more realistic Signal to Interferenceplus Noise Ratio (SINR) model for radio interference. The following cross-layer latencyminimization problem is studied: Given a set V of transceivers; and a set of source-destination pairs;(i) choose power levels for all the transceivers;(ii) choose routes for allconnections; and (iii) construct an end-to-end schedule such that the SINR constraints are …,Proceedings of the 8th ACM international symposium on Mobile ad hoc networking and computing,2007,131
VM-based shared memory on low-latency; remote-memory-access networks,Leonidas Kontothanassis; Galen Hunt; Robert Stets; Nikolaos Hardavellas; Michał Cierniak; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Wagner Meira Jr; Sandhya Dwarkadas; Michael Scott,Abstract Recent technological advances have produced network interfaces that provideusers with very low-latency access to the memory of remote machines. We examine theimpact of such networks on the implementation and performance of software DSM.Specifically; we compare two DSM systems---Cashmere and TreadMarks---on a 32-processor DEC Alpha cluster connected by a Memory Channel network. Both Cashmereand TreadMarks use virtual memory to maintain coherence on pages; and both use lazy;multi-writer release consistency. The systems differ dramatically; however; in themechanisms used to track sharing information and to collect and merge concurrent updatesto a page; with the result that Cashmere communicates much more frequently; and at amuch finer grain. Our principal conclusion is that low-latency networks make DSM based …,ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News,1997,114
Summarizing itemset patterns using probabilistic models,Chao Wang; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract In this paper; we propose a novel probabilistic approach to summarize frequentitemset patterns. Such techniques are useful for summarization; post-processing; and end-user interpretation; particularly for problems where the resulting set of patterns are huge. Inour approach items in the dataset are modeled as random variables. We then construct aMarkov Random Fields (MRF) on these variables based on frequent itemsets and theiroccurrence statistics. The summarization proceeds in a level-wise iterative fashion.Occurrence statistics of itemsets at the lowest level are used to construct an initial MRF.Statistics of itemsets at the next level can then be inferred from the model. We use thosepatterns whose occurrence can not be accurately inferred from the model to augment themodel in an iterative manner; repeating the procedure until all frequent itemsets can be …,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,107
Approximation algorithms for computing capacity of wireless networks with SINR constraints,Deepti Chafekar; VS Anil Kumar; Madhav V Marathe; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Aravind Srinivasan,A fundamental problem in wireless networks is to estimate its throughput capacity-given aset of wireless nodes; and a set of connections; what is the maximum rate at which data canbe sent on these connections. Most of the research in this direction has focused on eitherrandom distributions of points; or has assumed simple graph-based models for wirelessinterference. In this paper; we study capacity estimation problem using the more generalSignal to Interference Plus Noise Ratio (SINR) model for interference; on arbitrary wirelessnetworks. The problem becomes much harder in this setting; because of the non-locality ofthe SINR model. Recent work by Moscibroda et al.(2006) has shown that the throughput inthis model can differ from graph based models significantly. We develop polynomial timealgorithms to provably approximate the total throughput in this setting.,INFOCOM 2008. The 27th Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE,2008,106
Query by output,Quoc Trung Tran; Chee-Yong Chan; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract It has recently been asserted that the usability of a database is as important as itscapability. Understanding the database schema; the hidden relationships among attributesin the data all play an important role in this context. Subscribing to this viewpoint; in thispaper; we present a novel data-driven approach; called Query By Output (QBO); which canenhance the usability of database systems. The central goal of QBO is as follows: given theoutput of some query Q on a database D; denoted by Q (D); we wish to construct analternative query Q′ such that Q (D) and Q′(D) are instance-equivalent. To generateinstance-equivalent queries from Q (D); we devise a novel data classification-basedtechnique that can handle the at-least-one semantics that is inherent in the query derivation.In addition to the basic framework; we design several optimization techniques to reduce …,Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2009,103

In this article we present a novel non-parametric; self-tunable; approach to datarepresentation for computing this kernel; particularly targeting sparse matrices representingpower-law graphs. Using real web graph data; we show how our representation scheme;coupled with a novel tiling algorithm; can yield significant benefits over the current state ofthe art GPU efforts on a number of core data mining algorithms such as PageRank; HITSand Random Walk with Restart.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,102
Cache-conscious frequent pattern mining on a modern processor,Amol Ghoting; Gregory Buehrer; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Daehyun Kim; Anthony Nguyen; Yen-Kuang Chen; Pradeep Dubey,Abstract In this paper; we examine the performance of frequent pattern mining algorithms ona modern processor. A detailed performance study reveals that even the best frequentpattern mining implementations; with highly efficient memory managers; still grossly under-utilize a modern processor. The primary performance bottlenecks are poor data locality andlow instruction level parallelism (ILP). We propose a cache-conscious prefix tree to addressthis problem. The resulting tree improves spatial locality and also enhances the benefitsfrom hardware cache line prefetching. Furthermore; the design of this data structure allowsthe use of a novel tiling strategy to improve temporal locality. The result is an overallspeedup of up to 3.2 when compared with state-of-the-art implementations. We then showhow these algorithms can be improved further by realizing a non-naive thread-based …,Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases,2005,100
Bayesian locality sensitive hashing for fast similarity search,Venu Satuluri; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Given a collection of objects and an associated similarity measure; the all-pairssimilarity search problem asks us to find all pairs of objects with similarity greater than acertain user-specified threshold. Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) based methods havebecome a very popular approach for this problem. However; most such methods only useLSH for the first phase of similarity search-ie efficient indexing for candidate generation. Inthis paper; we present BayesLSH; a principled Bayesian algorithm for the subsequent phaseof similarity search-performing candidate pruning and similarity estimation using LSH. Asimpler variant; BayesLSH-Lite; which calculates similarities exactly; is also presented. Ouralgorithms are able to quickly prune away a large majority of the false positive candidatepairs; leading to significant speedups over baseline approaches. For BayesLSH; we also …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,97
Arithmetic and logic operations with DNA,Vineet Gupta; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Mohammed J Zaki,Abstract A lot of current research in DNA computing has been directed towards solvingdifficult combinatorial search problems. However; for DNA computing to be applicable on awider range of problems; support for basic computational operations such as logicoperations like AND; OR and NOT and arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction isnecessary. Unlike search problems; which can be solved by generating all possiblecombinations and extracting the correct output; these operations mandate that only a uniqueoutput be generated by specific inputs. The question of suitability of DNA for such simpleoperations has so far largely been unaddressed. In this paper we describe a novel methodfor using DNA molecules to solve the basic arithmetic and logic operations. We also showthat multiple rounds of operations can be performed in a single test tube; utilizing the …,DNA Based Computers,1997,97
Efficient progressive sampling for association rules,Srinivasan Parthasarathy,In data mining; sampling has often been suggested as an effective tool to reduce the size ofthe dataset operated at some cost to accuracy. However this loss to accuracy is often difficultto measure and characterize since the exact nature of the learning curve (accuracy vs.sample size) is parameter and data dependent; ie; we do not know a priori what sample sizeis needed to achieve a desired accuracy on a particular dataset for a particular set ofparameters. In this article we propose the use of progressive sampling; to determine therequired sample size for association rule mining. We first show that a naive application ofprogressive sampling is not very efficient for association rule mining. We then present arefinement based on equivalence classes; that seems to work extremely well in practice andis able to converge to the desired sample size very quickly and very accurately.

Mining frequent itemsets in evolving databases,AA Veloso; Wagner Meira Jr; MB de Carvalho; Bruno Pôssas; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; M Javeed Zaki,1 Introduction The field of knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD); spurred byadvances in data collection technology; is concerned with the process of deriving interestingand useful patterns from large datasets. The KDD process is computational and data-intensive and is inherently interactive and iterative in nature. In fact; interactivity is often thekey to facilitating effective data understanding and knowledge discovery. In such anenvironment; response time is crucial because lengthy time delay between responses ofconsecutive user requests can disturb the flow of human perception and formation of insight.The task of guaranteeing quick response times is more complicated in dynamic datasets;where there is a constant influx of data. Changes to the data can invalidate existing patternsor introduce new. Simply re-executing algorithms from scratch when a database is …,*,2002,94
A generalized framework for mining spatio-temporal patterns in scientific data,Hui Yang; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Sameep Mehta,Abstract In this paper; we present a general framework to discover spatial associations andspatio-temporal episodes for scientific datasets. In contrast to previous work in this area;features are modeled as geometric objects rather than points. We define multiple distancemetrics that take into account objects' extent and thus are more robust in capturing theinfluence of an object on other objects in spatial neighborhood. We have developedalgorithms to discover four different types of spatial object interaction (association) patterns.We also extend our approach to accommodate temporal information and propose a simplealgorithm to derive spatio-temporal episodes. We show that such episodes can be used toreason about critical events. We evaluate our framework on real datasets to demonstrate itsefficacy. The datasets originate from two different areas: Computational Molecular …,Proceedings of the eleventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery in data mining,2005,90

Symmetrizations for clustering directed graphs,Venu Satuluri; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Graph clustering has generally concerned itself with clustering undirected graphs;however the graphs from a number of important domains are essentially directed; egnetworks of web pages; research papers and Twitter users. This paper investigates variousways of symmetrizing a directed graph into an undirected graph so that previous work onclustering undirected graphs may subsequently be leveraged. Recent work on clusteringdirected graphs has looked at generalizing objective functions such as conductance todirected graphs and minimizing such objective functions using spectral methods. We showthat more meaningful clusters (as measured by an external ground truth criterion) can beobtained by symmetrizing the graph using measures that capture in-and out-link similarity;such as bibliographic coupling and co-citation strength. However; direct application of …,Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2011,78

Csv: visualizing and mining cohesive subgraphs,Nan Wang; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Kian-Lee Tan; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Extracting dense sub-components from graphs efficiently is an important objectivein a wide range of application domains ranging from social network analysis to biologicalnetwork analysis; from the World Wide Web to stock market analysis. Motivated by this needrecently we have seen several new algorithms to tackle this problem based on the (frequent)pattern mining paradigm. A limitation of most of these methods is that they are highlysensitive to parameter settings; rely on exhaustive enumeration with exponential timecomplexity; and often fail to help the users understand the underlying distribution ofcomponents embedded within the host graph. In this article we propose an approximatealgorithm; to mine and visualize cohesive subgraphs (dense sub components) within a largegraph.

An efficient algorithm for concurrent priority queue heaps,Galen C Hunt; Maged M Michael; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Michael L Scott,Abstract We present a new algorithm for concurrent access to array-based priority queueheaps. Deletions proceed top-down as they do in a previous algorithm due to Rao andKumar (1988); but insertions proceed bottom-up; and consecutive insertions use a bit-reversal technique to scatter accesses across the fringe of the tree; to reduce contention.Because insertions do not have to traverse the entire height of the tree (as they do inprevious work); as many as O (M) operations can proceed in parallel; rather than O (log M)on a heap of size M. Experimental results on a Silicon Graphics Challenge multiprocessordemonstrate good overall performance for the new algorithm on small heaps; and significantperformance improvements over known alternatives on large heaps with mixedinsertion/deletion workloads.,Information Processing Letters,1996,73
Toward terabyte pattern mining: an architecture-conscious solution,Gregory Buehrer; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Shirish Tatikonda; Tahsin Kurc; Joel Saltz,Abstract We present a strategy for mining frequent item sets from terabyte-scale data sets oncluster systems.

Furthermore; thesoftware was to be the new code base for the research group; allowing fast deployment ofnew algorithmic advances from the lab into the field.

Extracting analyzing and visualizing triangle k-core motifs within networks,Yang Zhang; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Cliques are topological structures that usually provide important information forunderstanding the structure of a graph or network. However; detecting and extracting cliquesefficiently is known to be very hard. In this paper; we define and introduce the notion of aTriangle K-Core; a simpler topological structure and one that is more tractable and canmoreover be used as a proxy for extracting clique-like structure from large graphs. Based onthis definition we first develop a localized algorithm for extracting Triangle K-Cores fromlarge graphs. Subsequently we extend the simple algorithm to accommodate dynamicgraphs (where edges can be dynamically added and deleted). Finally; we extend the basicdefinition to support various template pattern cliques with applications to networkvisualization and event detection on graphs and networks.

Towards nic-based intrusion detection,M Otey; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Amol Ghoting; G Li; Sundeep Narravula; D Panda,Abstract We present and evaluate a NIC-based network intrusion detection system. Intrusiondetection at the NIC makes the system potentially tamper-proof and is naturally extensible towork in a distributed setting. Simple anomaly detection and signature detection basedmodels have been implemented on the NIC firmware; which has its own processor andmemory. We empirically evaluate such systems from the perspective of quality andperformance (bandwidth of acceptable messages) under varying conditions of host load.The preliminary results we obtain are very encouraging and lead us to believe that such NIC-based security schemes could very well be a crucial part of next generation network securitysystems.,Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2003,64
Markov clustering of protein interaction networks with improved balance and scalability,Venu Satuluri; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Duygu Ucar,Abstract Markov Clustering (MCL) is a popular algorithm for clustering networks inbioinformatics such as protein-protein interaction networks and protein similarity networks.An important requirement when clustering protein networks is minimizing the number of bigclusters; since it is generally understood that protein complexes tend not to have more than15--30 nodes. Similarly; it is important to not output too many singleton clusters; since theydo not provide much useful information. In this paper; we show how MCL may be modifiedso as to better respect these two requirements; while also taking the link structure in thegraph into account. We design our algorithm on top of Regularized MCL (R-MCL)[16]; apreviously proposed modification of MCL. Our proposed variation computes a newregularization matrix at each iteration that penalizes big cluster sizes; with the size of the …,Proceedings of the first ACM international conference on bioinformatics and computational biology,2010,63
Out-of-core frequent pattern mining on a commodity PC,Gregory Buehrer; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Amol Ghoting,Abstract In this work we focus on the problem of frequent itemset mining on large; out-of-coredata sets. After presenting a characterization of existing out-of-core frequent itemset miningalgorithms and their drawbacks; we introduce our efficient; highly scalable solution.Presented in the context of the FPGrowth algorithm; our technique involves several novel I/O-conscious optimizations; such as approximate hash-based sorting and blocking; andleverages recent architectural advancements in commodity computers; such as 64-bitprocessing. We evaluate the proposed optimizations on truly large data sets; up to 75GB;and show they yield greater than a 400-fold execution time improvement.

Identifying functional modules in interaction networks through overlapping Markov clustering,Yu-Keng Shih; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Motivation: In recent years; Markov clustering (MCL) has emerged as an effectivealgorithm for clustering biological networks—for instance clustering protein–proteininteraction (PPI) networks to identify functional modules. However; a limitation of MCL andits variants (eg regularized MCL) is that it only supports hard clustering often leading to animpedance mismatch given that there is often a significant overlap of proteins acrossfunctional modules. Results: In this article; we seek to redress this limitation. We propose asoft variation of Regularized MCL (R-MCL) based on the idea of iteratively (re-) executing R-MCL while ensuring that multiple executions do not always converge to the same clusteringresult thus allowing for highly overlapped clusters. The resulting algorithm; denoted softregularized Markov clustering; is shown to outperform a range of extant state-of-the-art …,Bioinformatics,2012,61
Community discovery in social networks: Applications; methods and emerging trends,Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Yiye Ruan; Venu Satuluri,Abstract Data sets originating from many different real world domains can be represented inthe form of interaction networks in a very natural; concise and meaningful fashion. This isparticularly true in the social context; especially given recent advances in Internettechnologies and Web 2.0 applications leading to a diverse range of evolving socialnetworks. Analysis of such networks can result in the discovery of important patterns andpotentially shed light on important properties governing the growth of such networks. It hasbeen shown that most of these networks exhibit strong modular nature or communitystructure. An important research agenda thus is to identify communities of interest and studytheir behavior over time. Given the importance of this problem there has been significantactivity within this field particularly over the last few years. In this article we survey the …,*,2011,59
Towards data mining on emerging architectures,Gregory Buehrer; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; D Kim; Y Chen; A Nguyen; Pradeep Dubey,Abstract Recent advances in microprocessor design have given rise to new commodityarchitectures. One such innovation is to place multiple cores on a single chip; called ChipMultiprocessing (CMP). Each core is an independent computational unit; allowing multipleprocesses to execute concurrently. A second recent architectural advancement is to allowmultiple processes to compete for resources simultaneously on a single core; calledsimultaneous multithreading (SMT). SMT can improve overall throughput in cases whereCPU utilization is low. We investigate the implications of these advances on the design ofdata mining algorithms. In particular; we focus on frequent graph mining. Mining graphbased data sets has practical applications in many areas including molecular substructurediscovery; web link analysis; fraud detection; and social network analysis.

Our distributedalgorithms take into account the loss of messages due to contention from simultaneousinterfering transmissions in the wireless medium. We present randomized distributedalgorithms for (conflict-free) Distance-2 coloring; dominating set construction; and connecteddominating set construction in Unit Disk Graphs. The coloring algorithm has a timecomplexity of O (Δ log 2 n) and is guaranteed to use at most O (1) times the number of colorsrequired by the optimal algorithm.

Parallel and distributed methods for incremental frequent itemset mining,Matthew Eric Otey; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Chao Wang; Adriano Veloso; Wagner Meira,Traditional methods for data mining typically make the assumption that the data iscentralized; memory-resident; and static. This assumption is no longer tenable. Suchmethods waste computational and input/output (I/O) resources when data is dynamic; andthey impose excessive communication overhead when data is distributed. Efficientimplementation of incremental data mining methods is; thus; becoming crucial for ensuringsystem scalability and facilitating knowledge discovery when data is dynamic anddistributed. In this paper; we address this issue in the context of the important task offrequent itemset mining.

We then show how to parallelize this incremental algorithm. We also propose a …,IEEE Transactions on Systems; Man; and Cybernetics; Part B (Cybernetics),2004,59
Improving functional modularity in protein-protein interactions graphs using hub-induced subgraphs,Duygu Ucar; Sitaram Asur; Umit Catalyurek; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Dense subgraphs of Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) graphs are believed to bepotential functional modules and play an important role in inferring the functional behavior ofproteins. PPI graphs are known to exhibit the scale-free property in which a few nodes(hubs) are highly connected. This scale-free topology of PPI graphs makes it hard to isolatedense subgraphs effectively. In this paper; we propose a novel refinement method based onneighborhoods and the biological importance of hub proteins. We show that this refinementimproves the functional modularity of the PPI graph and leads to effective clustering intodense components. A detailed comparison of these dense components with the onesobtained from the original PPI graph reveal three major benefits of the refinement: i)Enhancement of existing functional groupings; ii) Isolation of new functional groupings; …,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2006,58

Speaker verification using minimum verification error training,Aaron E Rosenberg; Olivier Siohan; S Parathasarathy,We propose a minimum verification error (MVE) training scenario to design and adapt anHMM-based speaker verification system. By using the discriminative training paradigm; weshow that customer and background models can be jointly estimated so that the expectednumber of verification errors (false accept and false reject) on the training corpus areminimized. An experimental evaluation of a fixed password speaker verification task over thetelephone network was carried out. The evaluation shows that MVE training/adaptationperforms as well as MLE training and MAP adaptation when the performance is measuredby the average individual equal error rate (based on a posteriori threshold assignment).After model adaptation; both approaches lead to an individual equal error-rate close to0.6%.

Fast sparse matrix-vector multiplication on GPUs for graph applications,Arash Ashari; Naser Sedaghati; John Eisenlohr; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; P Sadayappan,Abstract Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) is a widely used computational kernel.The most commonly used format for a sparse matrix is CSR (Compressed Sparse Row); buta number of other representations have recently been developed that achieve higher SpMVperformance. However; the alternative representations typically impose a significantpreprocessing overhead. While a high preprocessing overhead can be amortized forapplications requiring many iterative invocations of SpMV that use the same matrix; it is notalways feasible--for instance when analyzing large dynamically evolving graphs. This paperpresents ACSR; an adaptive SpMV algorithm that uses the standard CSR format but reducesthread divergence by combining rows into groups (bins) which have a similar number of non-zero elements. Further; for rows in bins that span a wide range of non zero counts …,Proceedings of the international conference for high performance computing; networking; storage and analysis,2014,57

However; as processor technology evolves; said algorithms are often unable toderive the maximum achievable performance on these modern architectures. In this paper;we examine the performance of frequent pattern mining algorithms on a modern processor.A detailed performance study reveals that even the best frequent pattern miningimplementations; with highly efficient memory managers; still grossly under-utilize a modernprocessor. The primary performance bottlenecks are poor data locality and low instructionlevel parallelism (ILP).

Our approach relies on representing boththe queries and the data using a sequential encoding and then subsequently employing aninnovative variant of the longest common subsequence (LCS) matching algorithm to retrievethe desired results. A key innovation here is the use of a series of inter-linked early pruningsteps; coupled with a simple index structure that enable us to reduce the search space andeliminate a large number of false positive matches prior to applying the more expensive LCSmatching algorithm. Additionally; we also present mechanisms that enable the user tospecify constraints on the retrieved output and show how such constraints can be pusheddeep into the retrieval process; leading to improved response times.

Mining frequent itemsets in distributed and dynamic databases,Matthew Eric Otey; Chao Wang; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Adriano Veloso; Wagner Meira,Traditional methods for frequent itemset mining typically assume that data is centralized andstatic. Such methods impose excessive communication overhead when data is distributed;and they waste computational resources when data is dynamic. We present what we believeto be the first unified approach that overcomes these assumptions. Our approach makes useof parallel and incremental techniques to generate frequent itemsets in the presence of dataupdates without examining the entire database; and imposes minimal communicationoverhead when mining distributed databases. Further; our approach is able to generate bothlocal and global frequent itemsets. This ability permits our approach to identify high-contrastfrequent itemsets; which allows one to examine how the data is skewed over different sites.,Data Mining; 2003. ICDM 2003.

The incompleteness in these data sets may arisefrom a number of factors: in some cases it may simply be a reflection of certainmeasurements not being available at the time; in others the information may be lost due topartial system failure; or it may simply be a result of users being unwilling to specifyattributes due to privacy concerns. When a significant fraction of the entries are missing in allof the attributes; it becomes very difficult to perform any kind of reasonable extrapolation onthe original data. For such cases; we introduce the novel idea of conceptual reconstruction;in which we create effective conceptual representations on which the data mining …,Proceedings of the seventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2001,46
Understanding prediction-based partial redundant threading for low-overhead; high-coverage fault tolerance,Vimal K Reddy; Eric Rotenberg; Sailashri Parthasarathy,Abstract Redundant threading architectures duplicate all instructions to detect and possiblyrecover from transient faults. Several lighter weight Partial Redundant Threading (PRT)architectures have been proposed recently.(i) Opportunistic Fault Tolerance duplicatesinstructions only during periods of poor single-thread performance.(ii) ReStore does notexplicitly duplicate instructions and instead exploits mispredictions among highly confidentbranch predictions as symptoms of faults.(iii) Slipstream creates a reduced alternate threadby replacing many instructions with highly confident predictions. We explore PRT as apossible direction for achieving the fault tolerance of full duplication with the performance ofsingle-thread execution. Opportunistic and ReStore yield partial coverage since they arerestricted to using only partial duplication or only confident predictions; respectively …,ACM Sigplan Notices,2006,45
Similarity searching in peer-to-peer databases,Indrajit Bhattacharya; Srinivas R Kashyap; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,We consider the problem of handling similarity queries in peer-to-peer databases. Wepropose an indexing and searching mechanism which; given a query object; returns the setof objects in the database that are semantically related to the query. We propose anindexing scheme which clusters data such that semantically related objects are partitionedinto a small set of clusters; allowing for a simple and efficient similarity search strategy. Ourindexing scheme also decouples object and node locations. Our adaptive replication andrandomized lookup schemes exploit this feature and ensure that the number of copies of anobject is proportional to its popularity and all replicas are equally likely to serve a givenquery; thus achieving perfect load balancing. The techniques developed in this work areoblivious to the underlying DHT topology and can be implemented on a variety of …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2005. ICDCS 2005.

Similarity search on bregman divergence: Towards non-metric indexing,Zhenjie Zhang; Beng Chin Ooi; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract In this paper; we examine the problem of indexing over non-metric distancefunctions. In particular; we focus on a general class of distance functions; namely BregmanDivergence [6]; to support nearest neighbor and range queries. Distance functions such asKL-divergence and Itakura-Saito distance; are special cases of Bregman divergence; withwide applications in statistics; speech recognition and time series analysis among others.Unlike in metric spaces; key properties such as triangle inequality and distance symmetry donot hold for such distance functions. A direct adaptation of existing indexing infrastructuredeveloped for metric spaces is thus not possible. We devise a novel solution to handle thisclass of distance measures by expanding and mapping points in the original space to a newextended space. Subsequently; we show how state-of-the-art tree-based indexing …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,43
Near-optimal algorithms for shared filter evaluation in data stream systems,Zhen Liu; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Anand Ranganathan; Hao Yang,Abstract We consider the problem of evaluating multiple overlapping queries defined ondata streams; where each query is a conjunction of multiple filters and each filter may beshared across multiple queries. Efficient support for overlapping queries is a critical issue inthe emerging data stream systems; and this is particularly the case when filters areexpensive in terms of their computational complexity and processing time. This problemgeneralizes other well-known problems such as pipelined filter ordering and set cover; andis not only NP-Hard but also hard to approximate within a factor of o (log n) from theoptimum; where n is the number of queries. In this paper; we present two near-optimalapproximation lgorithms with provably-good performance guarantees for the evaluation ofoverlapping queries. We present an edge-coverage based Greedy algorithm which …,Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2008,43
Parallel algorithms for mining frequent structural motifs in scientific data,Chao Wang; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Discovery of important substructures from molecules is an important data miningproblem. The basic motivation is that the structure of a molecule has a role to play in itsbiochemical function. There is interest in finding important; often recurrent; substructuresboth within a single molecule and across a class of molecules. Recently; we havedeveloped a general purpose suite of algorithms--the MotifMiner Toolkit--that can mine forstructural motifs in a wide area of biomolecular datasets. While the algorithms have provento be extremely useful in their ability to identify novel substructures; the algorithmsthemselves are quite time consuming. There are two reasons for this: i) inherently thealgorithm suffers from the curse of subgraph isomorphism; and ii) handling noise effects (egprotein structure data) results in a significant slowdown. To address this problem in this …,Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Supercomputing,2004,43
Efficient discovery of common substructures in macromolecules,Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Matt Coatney,Biological macromolecules play a fundamental role in disease; therefore; they are of greatinterest to fields such as pharmacology and chemical genomics. Yet due to macromolecules'complexity; development of effective techniques for elucidating structure-functionmacromolecular relationships has been ill explored. Previous techniques have eitherfocused on sequence analysis; which only approximates structure-function relationships; oron small coordinate datasets; which does not scale to large datasets or handle noise. Wepresent a novel scalable approach to efficiently discover macromolecule substructuresbased on three-dimensional coordinate data; without domain-specific knowledge. Theapproach combines structure-based frequent pattern discovery with search space reductionand coordinate noise handling. We analyze computational performance compared to …,Data Mining; 2002.

Using clustering to boost text classification,YC Fang; S Parthasarathy; F Schwartz,Abstract In recent years we have seen a tremendous growth in the number of text documentcollections available on the Internet. Automatic text categorization; the process of assigningunseen documents to user-defined categories; is an important task that can help in theorganization and querying of such collections. In this article we consider the problem ofclassifying online papers from a specific journal in the geological sciences; over a set ofexpert defined categories. We evaluate two general strategies and several variants thereof.The first strategy is based on Naïve Bayes; a popular text classification algorithm. Thesecond strategy is based on Principle Direction Divisive Partitioning; an unsuperviseddocument clustering algorithm. While the performance of both approaches is quite good;some of the new variants that we propose including one; which involves a combination of …,ICDM Workshop on Text Mining (TextDM'01),2001,42
Distributed algorithms for connected domination in wireless networks,Rajiv Gandhi; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract We present fast distributed local control connected dominating set (CDS) algorithmsfor wireless ad hoc networks. We present two randomized distributed algorithms; CDSColorand CDSTop which take into account the effect of wireless interference and the consequentloss of messages during the execution of the algorithm. These algorithms produce a CDS ofconstant size and constant stretch ratio with high probability; and converge inpolylogarithmic running time. Specifically; algorithm CDSColor requires the nodes to know(estimates of) the maximum degree Δ and the size of the network n and converges in O (Δlog 2 n) time. Algorithm CDSTop requires the nodes to know their three-hop topology and(an estimate of) the network size n and converges in O (log 2 n) time.

Fast distributed well connected dominating sets for ad hoc networks,Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Rajiv Gandhi,We present the first distributed algorithms for computing connected dominating sets (CDS)for ad hoc networks that break the linear-time barrier. We present two algorithms whichrequire O (Delta log^ 2 (n)) and O (log^ 2 (n)) running time respectively; where Delta is themaximum node degree and'n'is the size of the network. This is a substantial improvementover existing implementations; all of which require Omega (n) running time. A basic primitivewhich underlies our first algorithm is Distance-2 coloring of the network. This primitive arisesnaturally in many applications such as broadcast scheduling and channel assignment.Minimizing the number of colors used in the coloring is very desirable for these applications;but this is known to be NP-hard. We present a fast distributed implementation of D2-coloringfor ad hoc networks which is guaranteed to use at most O (1) times the number of colors …,*,2004,38
Speaker identification using minimum classification error training,Olivier Siohan; Aaron E Rosenberg; Sarangarajan Parthasarathy,We use a minimum classification error (MCE) training paradigm to build a speakeridentification system. The training is optimized at the string level for a text-dependentspeaker identification task. Experiments performed on a small set speaker identification taskshow that MCE training can reduce closed-set identification errors by up to 20-25% over abaseline system trained using maximum likelihood estimation. Further experiments suggestthat additional improvement can be obtained by using some additional training data fromspeakers outside the set of registered speakers; leading to an overall reduction of the closed-set identification errors by about 35%.,Acoustics; Speech and Signal Processing; 1998.

Predicting functionality of protein–DNA interactions by integrating diverse evidence,Duygu Ucar; Andreas Beyer; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Christopher T Workman,Abstract Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-chip) experiments enable capturing physicalinteractions between regulatory proteins and DNA in vivo. However; measurement ofchromatin binding alone is not sufficient to detect regulatory interactions. A detected bindingevent may not be biologically relevant; or a known regulatory interaction might not beobserved under the growth conditions tested so far. To correctly identify physical interactionsbetween transcription factors (TFs) and genes and to determine their regulatory implicationsunder various experimental conditions; we integrated ChIP-chip data with motif bindingsites; nucleosome occupancy and mRNA expression datasets within a probabilisticframework. This framework was specifically tailored for the identification of functional andnon-functional DNA binding events. Using this; we estimate that only 50% of condition …,Bioinformatics,2009,35

On the use of constrained associations for web log mining,Hui Yang; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract In recent years there has been an increasing interest and a growing body of work inweb usage mining as an underlying approach to capture and model the behavior of userson the web for business intelligence and browser performance enhancements. Web usagemining strategies range from strategies such as clustering and collaborative filtering; toaccurately modeling sequential pattern navigation. However; many of these approachessuffer problems in terms of scalability and performance (especially online performance) dueto the size and sparse nature of the data involved and the fact that many of the methodsgenerate complex models that are less than amenable to an on-line decision makingenvironment.

Scalable all-pairs similarity search in metric spaces,Ye Wang; Ahmed Metwally; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Given a set of entities; the all-pairs similarity search aims at identifying all pairs ofentities that have similarity greater than (or distance smaller than) some user-definedthreshold. In this article; we propose a parallel framework for solving this problem in metricspaces. Novel elements of our solution include: i) flexible support for multiple metrics ofinterest; ii) an autonomic approach to partition the input dataset with minimal redundancy toachieve good load-balance in the presence of limited computing resources; iii) an on-the-flylossless compression strategy to reduce both the running time and the final output size. Wevalidate the utility; scalability and the effectiveness of the approach on hundreds ofmachines using real and synthetic datasets.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,34
A unified approach to scheduling on unrelated parallel machines,VS Kumar; Madhav V Marathe; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Aravind Srinivasan,Abstract We develop a single rounding algorithm for scheduling on unrelated parallelmachines; this algorithm works well with the known linear programming-; quadraticprogramming-; and convex programming-relaxations for scheduling to minimize completiontime; makespan; and other well-studied objective functions. This algorithm leads to thefollowing applications for the general setting of unrelated parallel machines:(i) a bicriteriaalgorithm for a schedule whose weighted completion-time and makespan simultaneouslyexhibit the current-best individual approximations for these criteria;(ii) better-than-twoapproximation guarantees for scheduling to minimize the L p norm of the vector of machine-loads; for all 1< p<∞; and (iii) the first constant-factor multicriteria approximation algorithmsthat can handle the weighted completion-time and any given collection of integer L p …,Journal of the ACM (JACM),2009,34
Detection and visualization of anomalous structures in molecular dynamics simulation data,Sameep Mehta; Kaden Hazzard; Raghu Machiraju; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; John Wilkins,Abstract In this article we explore techniques to detect and visualize features in data frommolecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Although the techniques proposed are general; wefocus on silicon (Si) atomic systems. The first set of methods use 3D location of atoms.Defects are detected and categorized using local operators and statistical modeling. Oursecond set of exploratory techniques employ electron density data. This data is visualized toglean the defects. We describe techniques to automatically detect the salient iso-values foriso-surface extraction and designing transfer functions. We compare and contrast the resultsobtained from both sources of data. Essentially; we find that the methods of defect (feature)detection are at least as robust as those based on the exploration of electron density for Sisystems.,Proceedings of the Conference on Visualization'04,2004,34
A single source k-shortest paths algorithm to infer regulatory pathways in a gene network,Yu-Keng Shih; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Motivation: Inferring the underlying regulatory pathways within a gene interactionnetwork is a fundamental problem in Systems Biology to help understand the complexinteractions and the regulation and flow of information within a system-of-interest. Given aweighted gene network and a gene in this network; the goal of an inference algorithm is toidentify the potential regulatory pathways passing through this gene. Results: In a departurefrom previous approaches that largely rely on the random walk model; we propose a novelsingle-source k-shortest paths based algorithm to address this inference problem. Animportant element of our approach is to explicitly account for and enhance the diversity ofpaths discovered by our algorithm. The intuition here is that diversity in paths can helpenrich different functions and thereby better position one to understand the underlying …,Bioinformatics,2012,33
Anomaly detection and spatio-temporal analysis of global climate system,Mahashweta Das; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Knowledge discovery from temporal; spatial and spatio-temporal data is pivotal forunderstanding and predicting the behavior of Earth's ecosystem model. An importantinfluence leaving its impact on the ecosystem is the global climate system. In this paper; theEarth Science data that we have analyzed consists of daily global air temperature andprecipitation measurements; aggregated from heterogeneous sensors for fifty years (1950--1999). The enormous amount of data that is available for analysis requires employment ofdata mining techniques for discovering interesting patterns; detecting significant changesand extracting meaningful insights from the data.

To alleviatethese negative impacts; we present novel association control algorithms that can minimizethe frequency of handoffs occurred to mobile devices. Specifically; we show that a greedyLookAhead algorithm is optimal in the offline setting; where the user's future mobility isknown.

A multi-level approach to SCOP fold recognition,Keith Marsolo; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Chris Ding,The classification of proteins based on their structure can play an important role in thededuction or discovery of protein function. However; the relatively low number of solvedprotein structures and the unknown relationship between structure and sequence requiresan alternative method of representation for classification to be effective. Furthermore; thelarge number of potential folds causes problems for many classification strategies;increasing the likelihood that the classifier will reach a local optima while trying todistinguish between all of the possible structural categories. Here we present a hierarchicalstrategy for structural classification that first partitions proteins based on their SCOP classbefore attempting to assign a protein fold.

Efficient; accurate and privacy-preserving data mining for frequent itemsets in distributed databases,Adriano A Veloso; Wagner Meira Jr; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Márcio Bunte De Carvalho,Abstract Mining distributed databases is emerging as a fundamental computational problem.A common approach for mining distributed databases is to move all of the data from eachdatabase to a central site and a single model is built. This approach is accurate; but tooexpensive in terms of time required. For this reason; several approaches were developed toefficiently mine distributed databases; but they still ignore a key issue- privacy. Privacy is theright of individuals or organizations to keep their own information secret. Privacy concernscan prevent data movement- data may be distributed among several custodians; none ofwhich is allowed to transfer its data to another site. In this paper we present an efficientapproach for mining frequent itemsets in distributed databases. Our approach is accurateand uses a privacy-preserving communication mechanism. The proposed approach is …,Computer Science,2003,32
Construction of a reference gene association network from multiple profiling data: application to data analysis,Duygu Ucar; Isaac Neuhaus; Petra Ross-MacDonald; Charles Tilford; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Nathan Siemers; Rui-Ru Ji,Abstract Motivation: Gene expression profiling is an important tool for gaining insight intobiology. Novel strategies are required to analyze the growing archives of microarray dataand extract useful information from them. One area of interest is in the construction of geneassociation networks from collections of profiling data. Various approaches have beenproposed to construct gene networks using profiling data; and these networks have beenused in functional inference as well as in data visualization. Here; we investigated a non-parametric approach to translate profiling data into a gene network. We explored thecharacteristics and utility of the resulting network and investigated the use of networkinformation in analysis of variance models and hypothesis testing.

Scalable global alignment for multiple biological networks,Yu-Keng Shih; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Advances in high-throughput technology has led to an increased amount of available dataon protein-protein interaction (PPI) data. Detecting and extracting functional modules thatare common across multiple networks is an important step towards understanding the role offunctional modules and how they have evolved across species. A global protein-proteininteraction network alignment algorithm attempts to find such functional orthologs acrossmultiple networks. In this article; we propose a scalable global network alignment algorithmbased on clustering methods and graph matching techniques in order to detect conservedinteractions while simultaneously attempting to maximize the sequence similarity of nodesinvolved in the alignment.

Our methodmaps an unordered tree into a multiset of simple wedge-shaped structures refered to aspivots. By coupling our pivot multisets with the idea of minwise hashing; we realize a fixedsized signature-sketch of the tree-structured datum yielding an effective mechanism forhashing such data. We discuss several potential pivot structures and study some of thetheoretical properties of such structures; and discuss their implications to tree edit distanceand properties related to perfect hashing.

Environments that produce streaming sources of data are becomingcommon place. Examples include stock market; sensor; web click stream; and network data.In many instances; these environments are also equipped with multiple distributedcomputing nodes that are often located near the data sources. Analyzing and monitoringdata in such environments requires data mining technology that is cognizant of the miningtask; the distributed nature of the data; and the data influx rate.

The analysis is based on 3120 papers from thejournal Water Resources Research with full contents and their citation data from the ISI Webof Science. The research is designed to develop a better understanding of the way citationnumbers can be interpreted by scientists. Not surprisingly; the most highly cited papersappear to be pioneers in the field with papers departing significantly from what has comebefore and to be effective in creating similar; follow-on papers. Papers that are earlycontributions to a new research strand that is highly influential will be on average highlycited.

The two mainproblems with analyzing protein-protein interaction networks are their scale-free propertyand the large number of false positive interactions that they contain. Our preprocessingtechniques use a key transformation and separate weighting functions to effectivelyeliminate suspect edges; potential false positives; from the graph. A useful side-effect of thistransformation is that the resulting graph is no longer scale free.

Asynchronous and anticipatory filter-stream based parallel algorithm for frequent itemset mining,Adriano Veloso; Wagner Meira; Renato Ferreira; Dorgival Guedes Neto; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract In this paper we propose a novel parallel algorithm for frequent itemset mining. Thealgorithm is based on the filter-stream programming model; in which the frequent itemsetmining process is represented as a data flow controlled by a series of producer andconsumer components (called filters); and the data flow (communication) between suchfilters is made via streams. When production rate matches consumption rate; andcommunication overhead between producer and consumer filters is minimized; a highdegree of asynchrony is achieved. Following this strategy; our algorithm employs anasynchronous candidate generation; and minimizes communication between filters bytransferring only the necessary aggregated information. Another nice feature of ouralgorithm is a look forward approach which accelerates frequent itemset determination …,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2004,25
Decision tree classification of spatial data patterns from videokeratography using Zernike polynomials,Michael D Twa; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Thomas W Raasch; MA Bullimore,Abstract Topological spatial data can be useful for the classification and analysis ofbiomedical data. Neural networks have been used previously to make diagnosticclassifications of corneal disease using summary statistics as network inputs. This approachneglects global shape features (used by clinicians when they make their diagnosis) andproduces results that are difficult to interpret clinically. In this study we propose the use ofZernike polynomials to model the global shape of the cornea and use the polynomialcoefficients as features for a decision tree classifier. We use this model to classify a sampleof normal patients and patients with corneal distortion caused by keratoconus.

Capacity of asynchronous random-access scheduling in wireless networks,Deepti Chafekar; Dave Levin; VS Anil Kumar; Madhav V Marathe; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Aravind Srinivasan,We study the throughput capacity of wireless networks which employ (asynchronous)random-access scheduling as opposed to deterministic scheduling. The central question weanswer is: how should we set the channel-access probability for each link in the network sothat the network operates close to its optimal throughput capacity? We design simple anddistributed channel-access strategies for random-access networks which are provablycompetitive with respect to the optimal scheduling strategy; which is deterministic;centralized; and computationally infeasible. We show that the competitiveness of ourstrategies are nearly the best achievable via random-access scheduling; thus establishingfundamental limits on the performance of random-access. A notable outcome of our work isthat random access compares well with deterministic scheduling when link transmission …,INFOCOM 2008. The 27th Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE,2008,24
The potential of the cell broadband engine for data mining,Gregory Buehrer; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,ABSTRACT In this article we examine the performance of key data mining kernels on the STICell Broadband Engine architecture. This architecture represents an interesting design pointalong the spectrum of chipsets with multiple processing elements. The STI Cell has onemain processor and eight support processing elements (SPEs); and while it represents amore general purpose architecture when compared to graphics processor units; memorymanagement is explicit. Thus while it is easier to program than GPUs it is not as easy toprogram as current day dual and quad-core processors designed by AMD and Intel.

A viewpoint-based approach for interaction graph analysis,Sitaram Asur; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Recent innovations have resulted in a plethora of social applications on the Web;such as blogs; social networks; and community photo and video sharing applications. Suchapplications can typically be represented as evolving interaction graphs with nodesdenoting entities and edges representing their interactions. The study of entities andcommunities and how they evolve in such large dynamic graphs is both important andchallenging. While much of the past work in this area has focused on static analysis; morerecently researchers have investigated dynamic analysis.

This assumption is no longer tenable. Such methods wastecomputational and I/O resources when the data is dynamic; and they impose excessivecommunication overhead when the data is distributed. As a result; the knowledge discoveryprocess is harmed by slow response times. Efficient implementation of incremental datamining ideas in distributed computing environments is thus becoming crucial for ensuringscalability and facilitating knowledge discovery when data is dynamic and distributed. In thispaper we address this issue in the context of frequent itemset mining; an important datamining task. Frequent itemsets are most often used to generate correlations and associationrules; but more recently they have been used in such far-reaching domains as bio …,International Conference on High-Performance Computing,2003,23
Comparison of discriminative training methods for speaker verification,Chengyuan Ma; Eric Chang,The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and Bayesian maximum a-posteriori (MAP)adaptation methods for Gaussian mixture models (GMM) have proven to be effective andefficient for speaker verification; even though each speaker model is trained using only hisown training utterances. Discriminative criteria aim at increasing discriminability by using out-of-class data. In this paper; we consider the speaker verification task using threediscriminative training methods to compare performance. Comparisons are discussed for themaximum mutual information (MMI); minimum classification error (MCE) and figure of merit(FOM) criteria. Experiments on the 1996 NIST speaker recognition evaluation data set showthat FOM training method outperforms the other two methods for speaker verification in termsof system performance. Meanwhile; logistic regression is investigated and successfully …,Acoustics; Speech; and Signal Processing; 2003. Proceedings.(ICASSP'03). 2003 IEEE International Conference on,2003,23

A fast algorithm for stochastic matching with application to robust speaker verification,Qi Li; Sarangarajan Parthasarathy; Aaron E Rosenberg,Acoustic mismatch between training and test environments is one of the major problems intelephone-based speaker recognition. Speaker recognition performances are degradedwhen an HMM trained under one set of conditions is used to evaluate data collected fromdifferent telephone channels; microphones; etc. The mismatch can be approximated as alinear transform in a cepstral domain.

We performexploratory analysis on Twitter1 to understand the dynamics of user engagement bystudying what attracts a user to participate in discussions on a topic. We identify variousfactors which might affect user engagement; ranging from content properties; networktopology to user characteristics on the social network; and use them to predict user joiningbehavior.

Unsupervised speaker segmentation of telephone conversations,Aaron E Rosenberg; Allen Gorin; Zhu Liu; Sarangarajan Parthasarathy,ABSTRACT A process for segmenting 2-speaker telephone conversations by speaker withno prior speaker models is described and evaluated. The process consists of an initialsegmentation using acoustic change and pause detection; segment clustering; and iterativemodeling of segment clusters and resegmentation. The technique has been evaluated on 6;approximately 3 min long; customer care conversations. The technique does not resolveshort (< 2 secs) or overlapping segments very well; but is capable of detecting longersegments (> 4 secs) with miss rates of the order of 10% and confusion rates 2% or less.,Seventh International Conference on Spoken Language Processing,2002,22
Spatial modeling and classification of corneal shape,Keith Marsolo; Michael Twa; Mark A Bullimore; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,One of the most promising applications of data mining is in biomedical data used in patientdiagnosis. Any method of data analysis intended to support the clinical decision-makingprocess should meet several criteria: it should capture clinically relevant features; becomputationally feasible; and provide easily interpretable results. In an initial study; weexamined the feasibility of using Zernike polynomials to represent biomedical instrumentdata in conjunction with a decision tree classifier to distinguish between the diseased andnon-diseased eyes.

Robust periodicity detection algorithms,Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Sameep Mehta; Soundararajan Srinivasan,Abstract Periodicity detection is an important pre-processing step for many time seriesalgorithms. It provides important information about the structural properties of a time series.Feature vectors based on periodicity can be used for clustering; classification; abnormalitydetection; and human motion understanding. The periodicity detection task is not difficult incase of simple and uncontaminated signal. Unfortunately; most of the real datasets exhibitone or more of the following properties: i) non-stationarity; ii) interlaced cyclic patterns andiii) data contamination; which makes the period detection extremely challenging. Aseemingly straightforward solution is to develop individual specialized algorithms forhandling each case separately. However; determining if a time series is non-stationary or iscontaminated in itself is an extremely difficult task.

A dissimilarity measure for comparing subsets of data: Application to multivariate time series,Matthew Eric Otey Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Similarity is a central concept in data mining. Many techniques; such as clusteringand classification; use similarity or distance measures to compare various subsets ofmultivariate data. However; most of these measures are only designed to find the distancesbetween a pair of records or attributes in a data set; and not for comparing whole data setsagainst one another. In this paper we present a novel dissimilarity measure based onprincipal component analysis for doing such comparisons between such data sets; and inparticular time series data sets. Our measure accounts for the correlation structure of thedata; and can be tuned by the user to account for domain knowledge. Our measure is usefulin such applications as change point detection; anomaly detection; and clustering in fieldssuch as intrusion detection; clinical trial data analysis; and stock analysis.,Temporal data mining: algorithms; theory and applications (TDM 2005),2005,20

An ensemble approach for clustering scale-free graphs,Sitaram Asur; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Duygu Ucar,ABSTRACT Several real-world networks of interest; such as social and biological networks;are modular in nature. Most of these networks also possess the scale-free property; whichmakes the task of detecting and isolating communities from these networks difficult. Theapplication of traditional clustering algorithms on these networks has not yielded a greatdeal of success. In this paper; we apply an ensemble clustering approach to address thisproblem. Ensemble clustering has been suggested as a good approach to improve theperformance of clustering algorithms. To perform initial clustering; we employ specifictopology-based distance metrics that are conducive for partitioning these networks. We usean ensemble of different base clustering algorithms to obtain a set of clusteringarrangements. We apply consensus clustering algorithms on this set to obtain the final set …,LinkKDD workshop,2006,19

Structure-based querying of proteins using wavelets,Keith Marsolo; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Kotagiri Ramamohanarao,Abstract The ability to retrieve molecules based on structural similarity has use in manyapplications; from disease diagnosis and treatment to drug discovery and design. In thispaper; we present a method to represent protein molecules that allows for the fast; flexibleand efficient retrieval of similar structures; based on either global or local attributes. Webegin by computing the pair-wise distance between amino acids; transforming each 3Dstructure into a 2D distance matrix. We normalize this matrix to a specific size and apply a2D wavelet decomposition to generate a set of approximation coefficients; which serves asour global feature vector. This transformation reduces the overall dimensionality of the datawhile still preserving spatial features and correlations. We test our method by runningqueries on three different protein data sets that have been used previously in the …,Proceedings of the 15th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2006,18
Mobility control for throughput maximization in ad hoc networks,Tamer Nadeem; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Physical topology of an ad hoc wireless network imposes fundamental limits on itsthroughput capacity. In this work; we present a network design algorithm for configuringnode locations in an 802.11 ad hoc network with the goal of improving the throughputcapacity of the network. Given a network configuration (ie; a mapping of network nodes tophysical locations); we establish an inverse proportional relationship between theinterference degree of the network and the guaranteed link-throughput. Motivated by thisobservation; we present an algorithm which progressively guides the network towards betterconfigurations with lower interference degrees; which in turn increases the network'sthroughput capacity.

A characterization of data mining algorithms on a modern processor,Amol Ghoting; Gregory Buehrer; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Daehyun Kim; Anthony Nguyen; Yen-Kuang Chen; Pradeep Dubey,ABSTRACT In this paper; we characterize the performance and memory access behavior ofseveral data mining algorithms. Specifically; we consider algorithms for frequent itemsetmining; sequence mining; graph mining; clustering; outlier detection; and decision treeinduction. Our study reveals that data mining algorithms are compute and memory intensive.Furthermore; all the algorithms have poor temporal locality and some have good spatiallocality. Hardware prefetching helps the algorithms with good spatial locality; but mostalgorithms are unable to leverage simultaneous multithreading because of their memoryintensive nature. Consequently; all these algorithms grossly under-utilize a modern dayprocessor. Using the knowledge gleaned in this investigation; we briefly show how weimprove the performance of a frequent itemset mining algorithm; FPGrowth; on a modern …,Proceedings of the 1st international workshop on Data management on new hardware,2005,18
Adaptive polling of grid resource monitors using a slacker coherence model,Radhakrishnan Sundaresan; Mario Lauria; T Kurc; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Joel Saltz,As data and computational grids grow in size and complexity; the crucial task of identifying;monitoring and utilizing available resources in an efficient manner is becoming increasinglydifficult. The design of monitoring systems that are scalable both in the number of sourcesbeing monitored and in the number of clients served is a challenging issue. In this paper weinvestigate the trade-offs of different polling strategies that can be used to monitor resourceavailability on machines in a distributed environment. We show how adaptive pollingprotocols can substantially increase scalability with a less than proportional loss ofprecision; and how these protocols can be personalized for different types of resource usagepatterns.,High Performance Distributed Computing; 2003.

Feature mining paradigms for scientific data,Ming Jiang; Tat-Sang Choy; Sameep Mehta; Matt Coatney; Steve Barr; Kaden Hazzard; David Richie; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Raghu Machiraju; David Thompson; John Wilkins; Boyd Gatlin,Abstract Numerical simulation is replacing experimentation as a means to gain insight intocomplex physical phenomena. Analyzing the data produced by such simulations isextremely challenging; given the enormous sizes of the datasets involved. In order to makeefficient progress; analyzing such data must advance from current techniques that onlyvisualize static images of the data; to novel techniques that can mine; track; and visualize theimportant features in the data. In this paper; we present our research on a unified frameworkthat addresses this critical challenge in two science domains: computational fluid dynamicsand molecular dynamics. We offer a systematic approach to detect the significant features inboth domains; characterize and track them; and formulate hypotheses with regard to theircomplex evolution.

These are the first non-trivial generalizationsof the job shop scheduling problem to scheduling with precedence constraints that are notjust chains. These are also the first non-trivial results for the weighted completion timeobjective on unrelated machines with precedence constraints of any kind. We obtainimproved bounds for the weighted completion time and flow time for the case of chains withrestricted assignment—this generalizes the job shop problem to these objective functions.We use the same lower bound of “congestion+ dilation”; as in other job shop schedulingapproaches (eg Shmoys; Stein and Wein; SIAM J.

MotifMiner: efficient discovery of common substructures in biochemical molecules,Matt Coatney; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Biochemical research often involves examining structural relationships inmolecules since scientists strongly believe in the causal relationship between structure andfunction. Traditionally; researchers have identified these patterns; or motifs; manually usingdomain expertise. However; with the massive influx of new biochemical data and the abilityto gather data for very large molecules; there is great need for techniques that automaticallyand efficiently identify commonly occurring structural patterns in molecules. Previousautomated substructure discovery approaches have each introduced variations of similarunderlying techniques and have embedded domain knowledge. While doing so improvesperformance for the particular domain; this complicates extensibility to other domains. Also;they do not address scalability or noise; which is critical for macromolecules such as …,Knowledge and information systems,2005,17

Research on how theaccuracyof a model changes as a function of dynamic updates to the databases is verylimited. In this work we show that extracting this information: knowing which aspects of themodel are changing; and how theyare changing as a function of data updates; can be veryeeffective for interactive data mining purposes (where response time is often more importantthan model qualityas long as model qualityi s not too far off the best (exact) model.

Simultaneous detection of communities and roles from large networks,Yiye Ruan; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Community detection and structural role detection are two distinct but closely-related perspectives in network analytics. In this paper; we propose RC-Joint; a novelalgorithm to simultaneously identify community and structural role assignments in a network.Rather than being agnostic to one assignment while inferring the other; RC-Joint employs aprincipled approach to guide the detection process in a nonparametric fashion and ensuresthat the two sets of assignments are sufficiently different from each other. Roles andcommunities generated by RC-Joint are both soft assignments; reflecting the fact that manyreal-world networks have overlapping community structures and role memberships. Bycomparing with state-of-the-art methods in community detection and structural role detection;we demonstrate that RC-Joint harvests the best of two worlds and outperforms existing …,Proceedings of the second ACM conference on Online social networks,2014,16
Economically-efficient sentiment stream analysis,Roberto Lourenco Jr; Adriano Veloso; Adriano Pereira; Wagner Meira Jr; Renato Ferreira; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Text-based social media channels; such as Twitter; produce torrents of opinionateddata about the most diverse topics and entities. The analysis of such data (aka. sentimentanalysis) is quickly becoming a key feature in recommender systems and search engines. Aprominent approach to sentiment analysis is based on the application of classificationtechniques; that is; content is classified according to the attitude of the writer. A majorchallenge; however; is that Twitter follows the data stream model; and thus classifiers mustoperate with limited resources; including labeled data and time for building classificationmodels. Also challenging is the fact that sentiment distribution may change as the streamevolves.

Capacity of wireless networks under SINR interference constraints,Deepti Chafekar; VS Anil Kumar; Madhav V Marathe; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Aravind Srinivasan,Abstract A fundamental problem in wireless networks is to estimate their throughput capacity—given a set of wireless nodes and a set of connections; what is the maximum rate at whichdata can be sent on these connections. Most of the research in this direction has focusedeither on random distributions of points; or has assumed simple graph-based models forwireless interference. In this paper; we study the capacity estimation problem using arealistic Signal to Interference Plus Noise Ratio (SINR) model for interference; on arbitrarywireless networks without any assumptions on node distributions. The problem becomesmuch more challenging for this setting; because of the non-locality of the SINR model.Recent work by Moscibroda et al.(IEEE INFOCOM 2006; ACM MobiHoc 2006) has shownthat the throughput achieved by using SINR models can differ significantly from that …,Wireless Networks,2011,16
Exploiting dataset similarity for distributed mining,Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Mitsunori Ogihara,Abstract The notion of similarity is an important one in data mining. It can be used to pro videuseful structural information on data as well as enable clustering. In this paper we presentan elegant method for measuring the similarity between homogeneous datasets. Thealgorithm presented is efficient in storage and scale; has the ability to adjust to timeconstraints. and can provide the user with likely causes of similarity or dis-similarity. Onepotential application of our similarity measure is in the distributed data mining domain. Usingthe notion of similarity across databases as a distance metric one cangenerate clusters ofsimilar datasets. Once similar datasets are clustered; each cluster can be independentlymined to generate the appropriate rules for a given cluster.

Approximation algorithms for throughput maximization in wireless networks with delay constraints,Guanhong Pei; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Aravind Srinivasan; Anil Kumar S Vullikanti,We study the problem of throughput maximization in multihop wireless networks with end-to-end delay constraints for each session. This problem has received much attention startingwith the work of Grossglauser and Tse (2002); and it has been shown that there is asignificant tradeoff between the end-to-end delays and the total achievable rate. We developalgorithms to compute such tradeoffs with provable performance guarantees for arbitraryinstances; with general interference models. Given a target delay-bound Δ (c) for eachsession c; our algorithm gives a stable flow vector with a total throughput within a factor of O(log Δ m/loglog Δ m) of the maximum; so that the per-session (end-to-end) delay is O (((log Δm/loglog Δ m) Δ (c)) 2); where Δ m= max c {Δ (c)}; note that these bounds depend only onthe delays; and not on the network size; and this is the first such result; to our knowledge.,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,2013,15

We use the same lowerbound of “congestion+ dilation”; as in other job shop scheduling approaches.

Our scheme is based upon a hierarchical clustering of the application-layermulticast peers and can be used to produce a number of different data delivery trees withspecific properties. On average; group members using our protocol maintain only a constantamount of state about other group members; and incur a constant amount of controloverhead.

Dynamic classification of defect structures in molecular dynamics simulation data,Sameep Mehta; Steve Barr; Tat-Sang Choy; Hui Yang; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Raghu Machiraju; John Wilkins,Abstract In this application paper we explore techniques to classify anomalous structures(defects) in data generated from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of Silicon (Si) atomsystems. These systems are studied to understand the processes behind the formation ofvarious defects as they have a profound impact on the electrical and mechanical propertiesof Silicon. In our prior work [12; 13; 14] we presented techniques for defect detection. Here;we present a two-step dynamic classifier to classify the defects. The first step uses up to third-order shape moments to provide a smaller set of candidate defect classes. The second stepassigns the correct class to the defect structure by considering the actual spatial positions ofthe individual atoms. The dynamic classifier is robust and scalable in the size of the atomsystems. Each phase is immune to noise; which is characterized after a study of the …,*,2005,14

Our new approaches make use of incremental techniques to provide significantI/O reduction; and parallel techniques to provide computational savings. At the same time;our approaches are able to effectively handle online data updates (deletions/insertions) andinteractive response times (approximate/partial results). Some additional highlights of theproposed approaches include extending the validity of the itemsets (generating approximatemodels of itemsets); and performing selective updates (tracking stable and predictableitemsets). These features allow our approaches to mine evolving data stored in warehousesas well as (potentially) streaming data. Extensive experimental benchmarking on evolvingdata demonstrates the potential advantages of the proposed approaches.

Active mining in a distributed setting,Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Sandhya Dwarkadas; Mitsunori Ogihara,Abstract Most current work in data mining assumes that the data is static; and a databaseupdate requires re-mining both the old and new data. In this article; we propose analternative approach. We outline a general strategy by which data mining algorithms can bemade active—ie; maintain valid mined information in the presence of user interaction anddatabase updates. We describe a runtime framework that allows efficient caching andsharing of data among clients and servers. We then demonstrate how existing algorithms forfour key mining tasks: Discretization; Association Mining; Sequence Mining; and SimilarityDiscovery; can be re-architected so that they maintain valid mined information across i)database updates; and ii) user interactions in a client-server setting; while minimizing theamount of data re-accessed.,*,2000,14
A spectral framework for detecting inconsistency across multi-source object relationships,Jing Gao; Wei Fan; Deepak Turaga; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Jiawei Han,In this paper; we propose to conduct anomaly detection across multiple sources to identifyobjects that have inconsistent behavior across these sources. We assume that a set ofobjects can be described from various perspectives (multiple information sources). Theunderlying clustering structure of normal objects is usually shared by multiple sources.However; anomalous objects belong to different clusters when considering different aspects.For example; there exist movies that are expected to be liked by kids by genre; but are likedby grown-ups based on user viewing history. To identify such objects; we propose tocompute the distance between different eigen decomposition results of the same object withrespect to different sources as its anomalous score. We also give interpretations from theperspectives of constrained spectral clustering and random walks over graph …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on,2011,13
A framework for sql-based mining of large graphs on relational databases,Sriganesh Srihari; Shruti Chandrashekar; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract We design and develop an SQL-based approach for querying and mining largegraphs within a relational database management system (RDBMS). We propose a simplelightweight framework to integrate graph applications with the RDBMS through a tightly-coupled network layer; thereby leveraging efficient features of modern databases.Comparisons with straight-up main memory implementations of two kernels-breadth-firstsearch and quasi clique detection-reveal that SQL implementations offer an attractive optionin terms of productivity and performance.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2010,13
Alternate representation of distance matrices for characterization of protein structure,Keith Marsolo; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,The most suitable method for the automated classification of protein structures remains anopen problem in computational biology. In order to classify a protein structure with anyaccuracy; an effective representation must be chosen. Here we present two methods ofrepresenting protein structure. One involves representing the distances between the C/suba/atoms of a protein as a two-dimensional matrix and creating a model of the resultingsurface with Zernike polynomials. The second uses a wavelet-based approach. We convertthe distances between a protein's C/sub a/atoms into a one-dimensional signal which is thendecomposed using a discrete wavelet transformation. Using the Zernike coefficients and theapproximation coefficients of the wavelet decomposition as feature vectors; we test theeffectiveness of our representation with two different classifiers on a dataset of more than …,Data Mining; Fifth IEEE International Conference on,2005,13
Mining Spatial Object Associations for Scientific Data.,Hui Yang; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Sameep Mehta,Abstract In this paper; we present efficient algorithms to discover spatial associations amongfeatures extracted from scientific datasets. In contrast to previous work in this area; featuresare modeled as geometric objects rather than points. We define multiple distance metricsthat take into account objects' extent. We have developed algorithms to discover two types ofspatial association patterns in scientific data. We present experimental results todemonstrate the efficacy of our approach on real datasets drawn from the bioinformaticdomain. We also highlight the importance of the discovered patterns by integrating theunderlying domain knowledge.,IJCAI,2005,13
Fast lightweight outlier detection in mixed-attribute data,Matthew Eric Otey; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Amol Ghoting,Abstract In recent years; researchers have proposed many techniques for detecting outliersin data sets. However; most of these techniques assume that the data set is static andconsists of homogeneous attribute types. However; these assumptions do not hold for manyreal-world data sets. To address these weaknesses; we present a technique for outlierdetection in dynamic mixed-attribute data. Our technique is capable of finding outliers in asingle pass of the data; and can do so with low memory requirements. Our approach uses acombination of classifiers and statistical tests to discover anomalous values of categoricaland continuous attributes. Our empirical results demonstrate that while our technique onlyshows marginal improvements in detection rates; its execution speed and memory usageare far better than those of current state-of-the-art outlier detection techniques.,Techincal Report; OSU–CISRC–6/05–TR43,2005,13

A spatio-temporal mining approach towards summarizing and analyzing protein folding trajectories,Hui Yang; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Duygu Ucar,Understanding the protein folding mechanism remains a grand challenge in structuralbiology. In the past several years; computational theories in molecular dynamics have beenemployed to shed light on the folding process. Coupled with high computing power andlarge scale storage; researchers now can computationally simulate the protein foldingprocess in atomistic details at femtosecond temporal resolution. Such simulation oftenproduces a large number of folding trajectories; each consisting of a series of 3Dconformations of the protein under study. As a result; effectively managing and analyzingsuch trajectories is becoming increasingly important. In this article; we present a spatio-temporal mining approach to analyze protein folding trajectories. It exploits the simplicity ofcontact maps; while also integrating 3D structural information in the analysis. It …,Algorithms for Molecular Biology,2007,12

Dissimilarity measures for detecting hepatotoxicity in clinical trial data,Matthew Eric Otey; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Donald C Trost,Abstract In clinical trials; pharmaceutical companies test the efficacy and safety of a newdrug for the treatment of a disease by comparing the results from a large number of diseasedand healthy patients exposed to either the new drug; an existing drug that treats the disease;or a placebo. One primary concern is liver toxicity; which is usually diagnosed by bloodanalyte tests. Often; such signals of toxicity lead to the discontinuation of drug developmentor the withdrawal of the drug from the market. Early detection of liver toxicity can save livesand also save such companies billions of dollars. Existing approaches for detecting livertoxicity typically ignore correlations between blood analyte values; but in this work wepresent novel dissimilarity measures based on principal component analysis which can beused for detecting liver toxicity and identifying subpopulations who may be susceptible by …,*,2006,12

Facilitating interactive distributed data stream processing and mining,Amol Ghoting; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Summary form only given. The past few years have seen the emergence of applicationdomains that need to process data elements arriving as a continuous stream. Recently;several architectures to process database queries over these data streams have beenproposed in the literature. Although these architectures may be suitable for general purposequery processing in a centralized-setting; they have serious limitations when it comes tosupporting data mining queries in a distributed-setting. Data mining is an interactive processand it is crucial that we provide the user with interactive response times. In addition; manydata mining applications; such as network intrusion detection; need to process data streamsarriving at distributed end-points.

NIC-based intrusion detection: A feasibility study,M Otey; R Noronha; G Li; S Parthasarathy; D Panda,Abstract We present and evaluate a NIC-based network intrusion detection system.Functions such as signature-based and anomaly-based packet classification are performedon the NIC; which has its own processor and memory. This makes the system virtuallyimpossible to bypass or tamper with as can be the case with software-based systems thatrely on the host operating system to function. We empirically evaluate such systems from theperspective of quality and performance (bandwidth of acceptable messages) under varyingconditions of host load. The preliminary results we obtain are very encouraging and lead usto believe that such NIC-based security schemes could very well be a crucial part of nextgeneration network security systems.,IEEE ICDM Workshop on Data Mining for Cyber Threat Analysis,2002,12

S-DSM for heterogeneous machine architectures,Eduardo Pinheiro; DeQing Chen; Sandhya Dwarkadas; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Michael L Scott,Abstract Many—indeed most—distributed applications employ some notion of distributedshared state: information required at more than one location. For applications that span theInternet; this state is almost always maintained by means of hand-written; application-specific messagepassing protocols. These protocols constitute a significant burden on theprogrammer. Rochester's InterWeave project seeks to eliminate this burden by automatingthe management of shared state for processes on heterogeneous; distributed machines.Heterogeneity implies the need for strong typing and for automatic conversion to and from acommon wire format when transmitting data and updates between machines.

Speaker identification with user-selected password phrases,Aaron E Rosenberg; Sarangarajan Parthasarathy,ABSTRACT An open-set speaker identification system is described in which general-text;sentence-long phrases are used as passwords. Customers are allowed to select their ownpassword phrases and the system has no knowledge of the text. Passwords are representedby phone transcriptions and whole-phrase Hidden Markov Models (HMM's). Phraseidentification; carried out using both speaker dependent and speaker independent models;constitutes an identity claim. Verification of the claim uses likelihood ratio scoring withspeaker independent phone HMM's providing the background model score. An evaluationhas been carried out over a database of password phrases spoken by 250 speakers. 100 ofthe speakers are test speakers. In an experimental trial; each test speaker is designated as acustomer or an imposter and speaks the phrase associated with the customer.

A generic flow algorithm for shared filter ordering problems,Zhen Liu; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Anand Ranganathan; Hao Yang,Abstract We consider a fundamental flow maximization problem that arises during theevaluation of multiple overlapping queries defined on a data stream; in a heterogenousparallel environment. Each query is a conjunction of boolean filters; and each filter could beshared across multiple queries. We are required to design an evaluation plan that evaluatesfilters against stream items in order to determine the set of queries satisfied by each item.The evaluation plan specifies for each item:(i) the subset of filters evaluated for this item andthe order of their evaluations; and (ii) the processor on which each filter evaluation occurs.Our goal is to design an evaluation plan which maximizes the total throughput (flow) of thestream handled by the plan; without violating the processor capacities.

Parallel Incremental 2D-Discretization on Dynamic Datasets.,Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Arun Ramakrishnan,Abstract Most current work in data mining assumes that the database is static; and adatabase update requires rediscovering all the patterns by scanning the entire old and newdatabase. Such approaches can waste a lot of computational and I/O resources; and resultin relatively slow response times; to essentially an interactive process. In this paper weaddress this issue in the context of 2-dimensional discretization within a multi-attributedatabase. Discretization; an important problem in data mining; is typically used to partitionthe range of continuous attribute (s) into intervals which highlight the behavior of a relateddiscrete attribute. It can be used to build decision trees and to determine appropriateaggregations for On-Line Analytical Processing. We first propose a time-optimal solution tothe problem.

Dynamic inference of social roles in information cascades,Sarvenaz Choobdar; Pedro Ribeiro; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Fernando Silva,Abstract Nodes in complex networks inherently represent different kinds of functional ororganizational roles. In the dynamic process of an information cascade; users play differentroles in spreading the information: some act as seeds to initiate the process; some limit thepropagation and others are in-between. Understanding the roles of users is crucial inmodeling the cascades. Previous research mainly focuses on modeling users behaviorbased upon the dynamic exchange of information with neighbors. We argue however thatthe structural patterns in the neighborhood of nodes may already contain enoughinformation to infer users' roles; independently from the information flow in itself. Toapproach this possibility; we examine how network characteristics of users affect theiractions in the cascade. We also advocate that temporal information is very important.

In this work; we examine the problem of discoveringgroups of motifs from different time series that exhibit some lag relationships. We define anew class of pattern called lagPatterns that captures the invariant ordering among motifs.lagPatterns characterize localized associative pattern involving motifs derived from eachentity and explicitly accounts for lag across multiple entities. We present an exact algorithmthat makes use of the order line concept and the subsequence matching property of thenormalized time series to find all motifs of various lengths. We also describe a method calledLPMiner to discover lagPatterns efficiently. LPMiner utilizes inverted index and motifalignment technique to reduce the search space and improve the efficiency.

Each sweepinvolves solving the operator locally at each cell. However; each direction induces a partialorder in which this computation can proceed. On a distributed computing system; the goal isto schedule the computation; so that the length of the schedule is minimized.

Active data mining in a distributed setting,Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Data Mining is a new interdisciplinary field merging ideas from statistics; machinelearning; databases; and high performance computing. The key challenge is the extractionof knowledge and insight from massive databases in a fast and efficient manner. Mostcurrent work in data mining assumes that the data is static; and that on a database update;or user interaction; information needs to be re-mined from scratch. Since mining in practiceis a largely iterative process; re-executing the algorithm from scratch each time can result inan explosion in the computational and I/O resources required. Furthermore; withimprovements in Internet technology and the rapid growth of the World Wide Web; manydata mining applications are being cast in a client-server mold.

b-HiVE: A bit-level history-based error model with value correlation for voltage-scaled integer and floating point units,G Tziantzioulis; AM Gok; SM Faisal; Nikolaos Hardavellas; S Ogrenci-Memik; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Existing timing error models for voltage-scaled functional units ignore the effect ofhistory and correlation among outputs; and the variation in the error behavior at different bitlocations. We propose b-HiVE; a model for voltage-scaling-induced timing errors thatincorporates these attributes and demonstrates their impact on the overall model accuracy.On average across several operations; b-HiVE's estimation is within 1--3% ofcomprehensive analog simulations; which corresponds to 5--17x higher accuracy (6--10x onaverage) than error models currently used in approximate computing research. To the bestof our knowledge; we present the first bit-level error models of arithmetic units; and the firsterror models for voltage scaling of bitwise logic operations and floating-point units.,Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Design Automation Conference,2015,9

Such a technique is useful for answering approximate queries as well as fordetermining an optimal query plan for complex queries based on said estimates. Ourapproach relies on a summary structure that contains the occurrence statistics of small twigs.We rely on a novel probabilistic approach for decomposing larger twig queries into smallerones. We then show how it can be used to estimate the selectivity of the larger query inconjunction with the summary information. We present and evaluate different strategies fordecomposition and compare this work against a state-of-the-art selectivity estimationapproach on synthetic and real datasets. The experimental results show that our proposedapproach is very effective in estimating the selectivity of XML twig queries.,International Conference on Extending Database Technology,2006,9

New parallel algorithms for frequent itemset mining in very large databases,Adriano Veloso; Wagner Meira; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Frequent itemset mining is a classic problem in data mining. It is a nonsupervised processwhich concerns in finding frequent patterns (or itemsets) hidden in large volumes of data inorder to produce compact summaries or models of the database. These models are typicallyused to generate association rules; but recently they have also been used in far reachingdomains like e-commerce and bio-informatics. Because databases are increasing in termsof both dimension (number of attributes) and size (number of records); one of the mainissues in a frequent itemset mining algorithm is the ability to analyze very large databases.Sequential algorithms do not have this ability; especially in terms of run-time performance;for such very large databases. Therefore; we must rely on high performance parallel anddistributed computing.

Parallel formulations of classification methods are desirable to improve trainingtimes for problems with large training sets as well as to exploit existing computing hardware.I survey the literature on parallel formulations of building decision trees from large trainingsets. Most approaches exploit data parallelism by distributing the work of evaluating splittingpoints at each node of the tree and building the tree in a breadth-first; synchronous manner.The alternative is to exploit task parallelism by assigning a processor or a group ofprocessors the task of building a specific subtree of the global decision tree.,the International Parallel Processing Symposium,2007,8
Knowledge-conscious data clustering,Amol Ghoting; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract We consider the problem of efficiently executing data clustering queries in a client-server setting. Extant solutions to this problem suffer from (a) a significant amount of remoteI/O and (b) minimal re-use of computation between both iterations of a kMeans query; andexecutions of different kMeans queries. We propose to facilitate interactive kMeansclustering by employing a client-side knowledge-cache. This knowledge-cache is succinctand significantly reduces the amount of remote I/O needed during execution. Furthermore; itpermits the re-use of computation; both within and between executions of the kMeansqueries.,European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2006,8
A model-based approach for mining membrane protein crystallization trials,Sitaram Asur; Pichai Raman; Matthew Eric Otey; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Motivation: Membrane proteins are known to play crucial roles in various cellularfunctions. Information about their function can be derived from their structure; but knowledgeof these proteins is limited; as their structures are difficult to obtain. Crystallization hasproved to be an essential step in the determination of macromolecular structure.Unfortunately; the bottleneck is that the crystallization process is quite complex andextremely sensitive to experimental conditions; the selection of which is largely a matter oftrial and error. Even under the best conditions; it can take a large amount of time; from weeksto years; to obtain diffraction-quality crystals. Other issues include the time and cost involvedin taking multiple trials and the presence of very few positive samples in a wide and largelyundetermined parameter space.

Each sweepinvolves solving the operator locally at each cell. However; each direction induces a partialorder in which this computation can proceed. On a distributed computing system; the goal isto schedule the computation; so that the length of the schedule is minimized. Severalheuristics have been proposed for this problem; but none of the heuristics have worst caseperformance guarantees. We present a simple; almost linear time randomized algorithmwhich (provably) gives a schedule of length at most O (log/sup 2/n) times the optimalschedule for instances with n cells; when the communication cost is not considered; and a …,Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium; 2005.

A new approach to protein structure mining and alignment,Hongyuan Li; Keith Marsolo; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Dmitrii Polshakov,Abstract One of the largest areas of focus in bioinformatic and data mining research hasbeen on the protein domain. These research efforts have included protein structureprediction; folding pathway prediction; sequence alignment; ab initio simulation; structurealignment; substructure detection and many others. In this work; we deal with substructuredetection and sequence alignment. Substructure detection is generally defined as themining of a molecule's 3D structure in order to find interesting/frequent domains. Sequencealignment involves determining the similarity of two (or more) protein molecules based onthe how well their amino acid sequences" match." There are potential pitfalls when tryingsolve both of these problems; however. In the case of substructure mining; focusing solelyon structural information can lead to the discovery of biologically irrelevant substructures …,Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Data Mining in Bioinformatics,2004,8
Facilitating Data Mining on a network of workstations,Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Ramesh Subramonian,Abstract The computationally-intensive nature of many data mining algorithms and the sizeof the datasets involved has motivated efforts to use parallel computing to produce timelyresults. A particularly cost effective computing platform for such parallelizations is a networkof workstations (NOW). However; there are many problems associated with efficientparallelizations on a NOW; including data transmission over a low bandwidth network; load-balancing; fault-tolerance; interactivity; programming complexity; etc. To address some ofthese problems; in this paper; we propose the programmable; distributed doall; a genericmechanism; similar to the doall primitive on SMPs; which schedules a set of independenttasks on a NOW. It allows incremental reporting of results; which is used to allow the user tomonitor and; if necessary; interrupt the operation.

Parallel Data Mining for Association Rules on Shared-memory Systems,Mohammed J Zaki; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Mitsunori Ogihara; LI WEI,Abstract. In this paper we present a new parallel algorithm for data mining of associationrules on sharedmemory multiprocessors. We study the degree of parallelism;synchronization; and data locality issues; and present optimizations for fast frequencycomputation. Experiments show that a significant improvement of performance is achievedusing our proposed optimizations. We also achieved good speed-up for the parallelalgorithm. A lot of data mining tasks (eg Association Rules; Sequential Patterns; etc.) usecomplex pointer-based data structures (eg hash trees) that typically su er from sub-optimaldata locality. In the multiprocessor case shared access to these data structures may alsoresult in false sharing. For these tasks it is commonly observed that the recursive datastructure is built once and accessed multiple times during each iteration. Furthermore; the …,Knowledge and Information Systems,1998,8

A bayesian perspective on locality sensitive hashing with extensions for kernel methods,Aniket Chakrabarti; Venu Satuluri; Atreya Srivathsan; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Given a collection of objects and an associated similarity measure; the all-pairssimilarity search problem asks us to find all pairs of objects with similarity greater than acertain user-specified threshold. In order to reduce the number of candidates to search;locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) based indexing methods are very effective. However; mostsuch methods only use LSH for the first phase of similarity search—that is; efficient indexingfor candidate generation. In this article; we present BayesLSH; a principled Bayesianalgorithm for the subsequent phase of similarity search—performing candidate pruning andsimilarity estimation using LSH. A simpler variant; BayesLSH-Lite; which calculatessimilarities exactly; is also presented. Our algorithms are able to quickly prune away a largemajority of the false positive candidate pairs; leading to significant speedups over …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2015,7
Mutual information based extrinsic similarity for microarray analysis,Duygu Ucar; Fatih Altiparmak; Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Genes responding similarly to changing conditions are believed to be functionallyrelated. Identification of such functional relations is crucial for annotation of unknown genesas well as the exploration of the underlying regulatory program. Gene expression profilingexperiments provide noisy datasets about how cells respond to different experimentalconditions. One way of analyzing these datasets is the identification of gene groups withsimilar expression patterns. A prevailing technique to find gene pairs with correlatedexpression profiles is to use linear measures like Pearson's correlation coefficient orEuclidean distance. Similar genes are later compiled into a co-expression network toexplore the system-level functionality of genes. However; the noise inherent in microarraydatasets reduces the sensitivity of these measures and produces many spurious pairs …,*,2009,7

Spoken query processing for information retrieval,Antonio Moreno-Daniel; Sarangarajan Parthasarathy; Biing-Hwang Juang; Jay G Wilpon,This work proposes a way to integrate an information retrieval (IR) system with an automaticspeech recognition (ASR) engine to support natural spoken queries. A broader interactionbetween the two modules is achieved by transmitting a lattice of terms to the IR system. Thisis in contrast with conventional systems where only the best-path recognition output istransmitted. Acoustic scores associated with the term-lattice are used to weigh the terms. Alatent semantic indexing (LSI) scheme in which documents and terms are mapped to asingle reduced feature-space with 400 semantic components is used. The conventional LSImethod is nevertheless modified to allow the aforementioned broader interaction betweenacoustic hypothesis and semantic determination.

Design of a next generation sampling service for large scale data analysis applications,Huai Wang; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Amol Ghoting; Shirish Tatikonda; Gregory Buehrer; T Kurc; J Saltz,Abstract Advances in data collection and storage technologies have resulted in large anddynamically growing data sets at many organizations. Database and data miningresearchers often use sampling with great effect to scale up performance on these data setswith small cost to accuracy. However; existing techniques often ignore the cost of computinga sample. This cost is often linear in the size of the data set; not the sample; which isexpensive. Furthermore; for data mining applications that leverage progressive sampling orbootstrapping-based techniques; this cost can be prohibitive; since they require thegeneration of multiple samples. To address this problem; we present a solution in thecontext of a state-of-the-art data analysis center. Specifically; we propose a scalable servicethat supports sample generation with cost linear in the size of the sample.

Towards a parameter-free and parallel itemset mining algorithm in linearithmic time,Gregory Buehrer; Roberto L de Oliveira; David Fuhry; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Extracting interesting patterns from large data stores efficiently is a challenging problem inmany domains. In the data mining literature; pattern frequency has often been touted as aproxy for interestingness and has been leveraged as a pruning criteria to realize scalablesolutions. However; while there exist many frequent pattern algorithms in the literature; allscale exponentially in the worst case; restricting their utility on very large data sets.Furthermore; as we theoretically argue in this article; the problem is very hard toapproximate within a reasonable factor; with a polynomial time algorithm.

This is especially true in power-constrained environments; such as embedded and mobile computing. While lowering theoperational voltage can reduce power consumption; there are limits imposed at design time;beyond which hardware components experience faulty operation. Moreover; the decrease infeature size has led to higher susceptibility to process variations; leading to reliability issuesand lowering yield. However; not all computations and all data in a workload need tomaintain 100% fidelity.

While embedding homogeneous networkshas been widely studied; few methods have examined the embedding of partially labeledattributed networks (PLAN) that arise in a semi-supervised setting. In this paper; we proposea novel framework; called Semi-supervised Embedding in Attributed Networks with Outliers(SEANO); to learn a robust low-dimensional vector representation that captures thetopological proximity; attribute affinity and label similarity of vertices in a PLAN whileaccounting for outliers.

Robust contextual outlier detection: Where context meets sparsity,Jiongqian Liang; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Outlier detection is a fundamental data science task with applications ranging fromdata cleaning to network security. Recently; a new class of outlier detection algorithms hasemerged; called contextual outlier detection; and has shown improved performance whenstudying anomalous behavior in a specific context. However; as we point out in this article;such approaches have limited applicability in situations where the context is sparse (ie;lacking a suitable frame of reference). Moreover; approaches developed to date do not scaleto large datasets. To address these problems; here we propose a novel and robustapproach alternative to the state-of-the-art called RObust Contextual Outlier Detection(ROCOD). We utilize a local and global behavioral model based on the relevant contexts;which is then integrated in a natural and robust fashion. We run ROCOD on both synthetic …,Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2016,4
Lazy Pipelines: Enhancing quality in approximate computing,G Tziantzioulis; AM Gok; SM Faisal; N Hardavellas; S Ogrenci-Memik; S Parthasarathy,Approximate computing techniques based on Voltage Over-Scaling (VOS) can providequadratic improvements in power efficiency. However; voltage scaling is limited by theinherent fault-tolerance of an application; thus preventing VOS schemes from realizing theirfull potential. To gain further power efficiency a reduction of the error rate experienced in agiven voltage level is required. We propose Lazy Pipelines; a micro-architectural techniquethat utilizes vacant cycles in a VOS functional unit to extend execution and reduce the errorrate.,2016 Design; Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE),2016,4

Characterizing dataset dependence for sparse matrix-vector multiplication on GPUs,Naser Sedaghati; Arash Ashari; Louis-Noël Pouchet; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; P Sadayappan,Abstract Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) is a widely used kernel in scientificapplications as well as data analytics. Many GPU implementations of SpMV have beenproposed; proposing different sparse matrix representations. However; no sparse matrixrepresentation is consistently superior; and the best representation varies for sparsematrices with different sparsity patterns. In this paper we study four popular sparserepresentations implemented in the NVIDIA cuSPARSE library: CSR; ELL; COO and ahybrid ELL-COO scheme. We analyze statistical features of a dataset of 27 matrices;covering a wide spectrum of sparsity features; and attempt to correlate SpMV performancewith each representation with simple aggregate metrics of the matrices. We present someinsights on the correlation between matrix features and the best choice for sparse matrix …,Proceedings of the 2nd workshop on parallel programming for analytics applications,2015,4

Parallel outlier detection,*,A method; system and computer program product for detecting outliers in a set of datapoints. In one embodiment; the method comprises partitioning the set of data points into aplurality of bins with each of the data points assigned to a respective one of the bins. Aplurality of local lists are formed in parallel identifying points in the bins as outliers; and thelocal lists are merged into a global list to identify one or more of the points as outliers of thedata set. Embodiments of the invention provide an outlier detection system that canparallelize in two levels. The dataset is split into partitions; called bins; and outliers are foundin each bin in parallel. The execution of a single bin is also parallelized. Embodiments of theinvention can scale to very large datasets by these two modes of parallelism.,*,2013,4
The application of statistical relational learning to a database of criminal and terrorist activity,Brian Delaney; A Fast; W Campbell; C Weinstein; D Jensen,Abstract We apply statistical relational learning to a database of criminal and terrorist activityto predict attributes and event outcomes. The database stems from a collection of newsarticles and court records which are carefully annotated with a variety of variables; includingcategorical and continuous fields. Manual analysis of this data can help inform decisionmakers seeking to curb violent activity within a region. We use this data to build relationalmodels from historical data to predict attributes of groups; individuals; or events. Our firstexample involves predicting social network roles within a group under a variety of differentdata conditions. Collective classification can be used to boost the accuracy under data poorconditions. Additionally; we were able to predict the outcome of hostage negotiations usingmodels trained on previous kidnapping events. The overall framework and techniques …,*,2010,4
A distributed placement service for graph-structured and tree-structured data,Gregory Buehrer; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Shirish Tatikonda,Abstract Effective data placement strategies can enhance the performance of data-intensiveapplications implemented on high end computing clusters.

Directory retrieval using voice form-filling,Sarangarajan Parthasarathy; Antonio Moreno-Daniel,Accurate retrieval of entries from large directories is a difficult task. Practical systems attemptto achieve acceptable performance using dialog to restrict the size of the directory. Forinstance; knowledge of city and state can be used to restrict the entries in a telephonenumber retrieval application. It is shown that it is advantageous to use a voice form-fillingparadigm in which the user speaks all the field entries; first name; last name; city; and state;in a single utterance. A two-pass method for form-filling presented recently (S. Parthsarathyet al.; 2005) is evaluated on the directory retrieval task. A delayed network expansion andpruning method is proposed to improve the efficiency of short-list generation in the form-filling algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that sentence accuracies greater than85% can be achieved on directory sizes of up to 8 million entries; with modest computing …,Acoustics; Speech and Signal Processing; 2007.

On trajectory representation for scientific features,Sameep Mehta; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Raghu Machiraju,In this article; we present trajectory representation algorithms for tangible features found intemporally varying scientific datasets. Rather than modeling the features as points; we takeattributes like shape and extent of the feature into account. Our contention is that theseattributes play an important role in understanding the temporal evolution and interactionsamong features. The proposed representation scheme is based on motion and shapeparameters including linear velocity; angular velocity; etc. We use these parameters tosegment the trajectory instead of relying on the geometry of the trajectory. We evaluate ouralgorithms on real datasets originating from different domains. We show the accuracy of themotion and shape parameter estimation by reconstructing the trajectories with highaccuracy. Finally; we present performance and scalability results.,Data Mining; 2006. ICDM'06. Sixth International Conference on,2006,4

Support for Machine and Language Heterogeneity in a Distributed Shared State System,Chunqiang Tang; DeQing Chen; Sandhya Dwarkadas; Michael L Scott,Abstract InterWeave is a distributed middleware system that supports the sharing of stronglytyped; pointer-rich data structures across heterogeneous platforms. Unlike RPC-stylesystems (including DCOM; CORBA; Java RMI); InterWeave does not require processes toemploy a procedural interface: it allows them to access shared data using ordinary readsand writes. To save bandwidth in wide area networks; InterWeave caches data locally; andemploys two-way diffing to maintain coherence and consistency; transmitting only theportions of the data that have changed.

Edge importance identification for energy efficient graph processing,SM Faisal; G Tziantzioulis; AM Gok; Nikolaos Hardavellas; S Ogrenci-Memik; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Modern graphs are large; often containing billions of nodes and edges that demand hugeamount of processing for analysis purposes. The algorithms processing these graphs oftenrun for long time and consume substantial amount of energy. However; not all edges in thegraphs are equally important. Some edges play critical role in maintaining the communityand other interesting structures in the graph; while the rest are less important for analysis.Identifying edges as important and unimportant allows one to apply elastic fidelity computingwhen processing edges of low importance; hence saving significant amount of energy whileprocessing large graphs. In this paper we propose a novel technique for identifyingimportant edges in a graph using a fast method that exploits locality sensitive hashing.

We explore algorithmic designsthat improve the memory performance of such algorithms; both in terms of alleviating latencyto memory as well as in terms of reducing the off-chip traffic. We then explore adaptive task-parallel and data-parallel design strategies which facilitate effective parallelization even inthe presence of data and workload skew while minimizing parallelization overheads. Weshow that our optimized algorithms achieve orders of magnitude improvement both in runtime and memory usage; when compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Also; we show thatour adaptive parallelization strategy achieves near-linear speedups on a modern dual quad-core system.,Proceedings of the 13th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and practice of parallel programming,2008,3
Scalable mining on emerging architectures,Gregory T Buehrer,Abstract Data mining is the process of discovering interesting and previously unknowninformation from such stores. Recent advances in data collection technology havegenerated large-scale data stores. However; as the ability to collect and store dataincreases; our ability to make use of the data degrades. This degradation is due to two mainissues. First; the utility of efficient serial algorithms to mine such data is often loweredbecause this data is distributed on multiple machines. Second; since the complexity of mostmining algorithms is polynomial or even exponential with the input size; even on parallelmachines the runtimes exceed practical limitations. This dissertation addresses theconcerns of mining large data stores by providing improvements to the state of the art in twodirections. First; mining algorithms are restructured to glean the benefits of emerging …,*,2008,3
On the use of viewpoint neighborhoods for dynamic graph analysis,Sitaram Asur; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,ABSTRACT Recent innovations have resulted in a plethora of social applications on theWeb; such as blogs; social networks; and community photo and video sharing applications.Such applications can typically be represented as evolving interaction graphs with nodesdenoting entities and edges representing their interactions. The study of entities andcommunities and how they evolve in such large dynamic graphs is both important andchallenging. While much of the past work in this area has focused on static analysis; morerecently researchers have investigated dynamic analysis. In this paper; we focus on dynamicgraph analysis; but in a departure from recent efforts; we consider the problem of analyzingpatterns and critical events that affect the dynamic graph from the viewpoint of a single node;or from the viewpoint of a selected subset of nodes.

Intrusion detection is an important problemfor wireless sensor networks in defense and security applications. Since intrusions are rare;they need to be handled efficiently. This involves: 1) continuous monitoring for threats andintrusions; 2) rapid detection; and possibly even classification and tracking; of intrusions;and 3) rapid decision making. Furthermore; sensor networks are burdened by limited batterypower; which creates the need for energy-efficient classification models to address thisissue. Our goal in this work is to build local classification models in clustered sensornetworks to perform efficient detection of rare events; while also improving the lifetime of thenetwork by reducing energy losses.

Learning approximate mrfs from large transaction data,Chao Wang; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract In this paper we consider the problem of learning approximate Markov RandomFields (MRFs) from large transaction data. We rely on frequent itemsets to learn MRFs on thedata. Since learning exact large MRFs is generally intractable; we resort to learningapproximate MRFs. Our proposed modeling approach first employs graph partitioning tocluster variables into balanced disjoint partitions; and then augments important interactionsacross partitions to capture interdependencies across them. A novel treewidth basedaugmentation scheme is proposed to boost performance. We learn an exact local MRF foreach partition and then combine all the local MRFs together to derive a global model of thedata. A greedy approximate inference scheme is developed on this global model. Wedemonstrate the use of the learned MRFs on the selectivity estimation problem.

While effective for problems such as fold recognition or remote homologydetection; these kernels are essentially a “black-box” solution to the structure predictionproblem.

Sequence mining in dynamic and interactive environments,Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Mohammed J Zaki; Mitsunori Ogihara; Sandhya Dwarkadas,Abstract The discovery of frequent sequences in temporal databases is an important datamining problem. Most current work assumes that the database is static; and a databaseupdate requires rediscovering all the patterns by scanning the entire old and new database.In this paper; we propose novel techniques for maintaining sequences in the presence of a)database updates; and b) user interaction (eg modifying mining parameters). This is a verychallenging task; since such updates can invalidate existing sequences or introduce newones. In both the above scenarios; we avoid re-executing the algorithm on the entire dataset;thereby reducing execution time. Experimental results confirm that our approach results inexecution time improvements of up to several orders of magnitude in practice.,*,2002,3

In this paper weadvocate the perspective that an observed graph is often a noisy version of some discretized1-skeleton of a hidden domain; and specifically we will consider the following naturalnetwork model: We assume that there is a true graph ${G^*} $ which is a certain proximitygraph for points sampled from a hidden domain $\mathcal {X} $; while the observed graph $G $ is an Erd\"{o} sR\'{e} nyi\xspace type perturbed version of ${G^*} $.

Component detection in directed networks,Yu-Keng Shih; Sungmin Kim; Yiye Ruan; Jinxing Cheng; Abhishek Gattani; Tao Shi; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Community detection has been one of the fundamental problems in networkanalysis. Results from community detection (for example; grouping of products by latentcategory) can also serve as information nuggets to other business applications; such asproduct recommendation or taxonomy building. Because several real networks are naturallydirected; eg World Wide Web; some recent studies proposed algorithms for detectingvarious types of communities in a directed network. However; few of them considered thatnodes play two different roles; source and terminal; in a directed network. In this paper; weadopt a novel concept of communities; directional community; and propose a new algorithmbased on Markov Clustering to detect directional communities. We then first compare ouralgorithm; Dual R-MCL; on synthetic networks with two recent algorithms also designed …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2014,2
Impact of DHCP churn on network characterization,Long Vu; Deepak Turaga; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,1. INTRODUCTION Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [6] allows networks to assignInternet Protocol addresses (IP) auto- matically to clients. DHCP has been used extensively toreduce client configuration when allocating IP addresses; es- pecially when networks have alimited IP address space but includes many occasionally connected clients. One funda- mentalcharacteristic of DHCP is that DHCP churn exists in the network. That is; the DHCP server mayassign the same IP address to different clients; and one single client may receive distinct IP addressesat different times. Essen- tially; DHCP churn creates a many-to-many mapping be- tween clientsand IP addresses; which results in ambiguity in distinguishing network clients. Past researchon DHCP focused on how to improve IP ad- dress allocation; how to configure the lease duration[6]; or how to detect abnormal IP addresses from DHCP logs [3]. However; there is no …,ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review,2014,2

Summarization via Pattern Utility and Ranking: A Novel Framework for Social Media Data Analytics.,Xintian Yang; Yiye Ruan; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Amol Ghoting,Abstract The firehose of data generated by users on social networking and microbloggingsites such as Facebook and Twitter is enormous. The data can be classified into twocategories: the textual content written by the users and the topological structure of theconnections among users. Real-time analytics on such data is challenging with most currentefforts largely focusing on the efficient querying and retrieval of data produced recently. Inthis article; we present a dynamic pattern driven approach to summarize social networkcontent and topology. The resulting family of algorithms relies on the common principles ofsummarization via pattern utilities and ranking (SPUR). SPUR and its dynamic variant (D-SPUR) relies on an in-memory summary while retaining sufficient information to facilitate arange of user-specific and topic-specific temporal analytics. We then follow up by …,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,2013,2
On the role of social identity and cohesion in characterizing online social communities,Hemant Purohit; Yiye Ruan; David Fuhry; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Amit Sheth,Abstract: Two prevailing theories for explaining social group or community structure arecohesion and identity. The social cohesion approach posits that social groups arise out of anaggregation of individuals that have mutual interpersonal attraction as they share commoncharacteristics. These characteristics can range from common interests to kinship ties andfrom social values to ethnic backgrounds. In contrast; the social identity approach posits thatan individual is likely to join a group based on an intrinsic self-evaluation at a cognitive orperceptual level. In other words group members typically share an awareness of a commoncategory membership. In this work we seek to understand the role of these two contrastingtheories in explaining the behavior and stability of social communities in Twitter. A specificfocal point of our work is to understand the role of these theories in disparate contexts …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0141,2012,2
MRAM for Shared Memory in GPGPUs,Prateeksha Satyamoorthy; Sonali Parthasarathy,Abstract—The application of new emerging Non-Volatile Memory technologies (NVMs) suchas MRAMs in other processing contexts poses an interesting challenge. GPGPUs are usedto exploit parallelism in non-graphic applications. While shared memory access is muchfaster than global memory accesses; the size of the available shared memory in currentGPGPUs is limited to 16KB which puts a ceiling on the performance benefits that can bereaped. This paper proposes a design methodology to solve this problem by replacing theSRAM shared memory with an MRAM within the fixed area and power constraints. It alsodescribes the design and policy of a write buffer which masks the latencies associated withMRAM writes.,Technical report; University of Virginia,2011,2

Efficient Design of End-to-End Probes for Source-Routed Networks,Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Rajeev Rastogi; Marina Thottan,Migration to a converged network has caused service providers to deploy real timeapplications such as voice over an IP (VoIP) network. From the provider's perspective; thesuccess of such emerging multimedia services over IP networks depend on mechanismswhich help understand the network-wide end-to-end performance dynamics. In this work; wepresent a mechanism to design efficient probes for measuring end-to-end performanceimpairments such as network delay and loss for a specific service in the provider network.We address two main issues related to deploying network probes:(1) the need for correlatingthe topology data with the measured values and (2) reducing the amount of probe traffic. Weuse explicitly routed probe packets to alleviate the need for correlation with topologymeasurements. We also present a 3.5-approximation algorithm for designing probe-sets …,*,2007,2

All of these proteins contain the C2H2 zincfinger. This motif has very specific physicalchemical and structural properties that facilitatethe binding of the zinc ion. Typically; zinc finger proteins contain multiple zinc binding sites.Therefore; our algorithm should be able to detect such a location. The key features of thismotif include the presence of a pair of Cys residues separated from a pair of His residues.Our algorithm found such motifs to be frequent across all proteins in dataset. These motifscontain both the Cys and His residues found in the classical zinc finger.,International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology,2005,2

The authors do notwish to enter into yet another polemical debate on the pros and cons of formal methods.Instead; the paper proposes a holistic approach to the subject. The authors describe theoutlines of a concept called the “BMW approach”(the resemblance of this name to a famousmake of German cars is only a coincidence!).

Facilitating data mining on a network of workstations.” in Advances in distributed and parallel knowledge discovery,Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Ramesh Subramonian,Abstract The computationally-intensive nature of many data mining algorithms and the sizeof the datasets involved has motivated efforts to use parallel computing to produce timelyresults.

Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,Adriano Veloso; Wagner Meira; Márcio Bunte De Carvalho; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Mohammed Zaki,Abstract This paper deals with new approaches to maintaining frequent itemsets in evolvingdatabases. Our new approaches make use of incremental techniques to provide significantI/O reduction; and parallel techniques to provide computational savings. At the same time;our approaches are able to effectively handle online data updates (deletions/insertions) andinteractive response times (approximate/partial results). Some additional highlights of theproposed approaches include extending the validity of the itemsets (generating approximatemodels of itemsets); and performing selective updates (tracking stable and predictableitemsets). These features allow our approaches to mine evolving data stored in warehousesas well as (potentially) streaming data. Extensive experimental benchmarking on evolvingdata demonstrates the potential advantages of the proposed approaches. We believe that …,*,*,2

We experiment withthe use of dependency paths; rather than regular expressions; as the formalism forrepresenting patterns that may be indicative of a semantic relation between noun pairs. Ourcorpus is Wikipedia article abstracts; and we tag our training set using WordNet. We collectfrequent dependency paths and using these as features; train two classification algorithms topredict the existence of a semantic relation among noun pairs in the test corpus; whichpredictions we evaluate using human judgment as the gold standard.

Visualizing Attributed Graphs via Terrain Metaphor,Yang Zhang; Yusu Wang; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract The value proposition of a dataset often resides in the implicit interconnections orexplicit relationships (patterns) among individual entities; and is often modeled as a graph.Effective visualization of such graphs can lead to key insights uncovering such value. In thisarticle we propose a visualization method to explore attributed graphs with numericalattributes associated with nodes (or edges). Such numerical attributes can represent rawcontent information; similarities; or derived information reflecting important networkmeasures such as triangle density and centrality. The proposed visualization strategy seeksto simultaneously uncover the relationship between attribute values and graph topology;and relies on transforming the network to generate a terrain map. A key objective here is toensure that the terrain map reveals the overall distribution of components-of-interest (eg …,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2017,1
Breaking Cycles in Noisy Hierarchies,Jiankai Sun; Deepak Ajwani; Patrick K Nicholson; Alessandra Sala; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Taxonomy graphs that capture hyponymy or meronymy relationships throughdirected edges are expected to be acyclic. However; in practice; they may have thousands ofcycles; as they are often created in a crowd-sourced way. Since these cycles representlogical fallacies; they need to be removed for many web applications. In this paper; weaddress the problem of breaking cycles while preserving the logical structure (hierarchy) of adirected graph as much as possible. Existing approaches for this problem either needmanual intervention or use heuristics that can critically alter the taxonomy structure. Incontrast; our approach infers graph hierarchy using a range of features; including aBayesian skill rating system and a social agony metric. We also devise several strategies toleverage the inferred hierarchy for removing a small subset of edges to make the graph …,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Web Science Conference,2017,1

A common representation for such models is the snapshot model-where a network is defined at logical time-stamps. An important problem under this model ischange point detection. In this work we devise an effective and efficient three-step-approachfor detecting change points in dynamic networks under the snapshot model.

Improving locality sensitive hashing based similarity search and estimation for kernels,Aniket Chakrabarti; Bortik Bandyopadhyay; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract We present a novel data embedding that significantly reduces the estimation errorof locality sensitive hashing (LSH) technique when used in reproducing kernel Hilbert space(RKHS). Efficient and accurate kernel approximation techniques either involve the kernelprincipal component analysis (KPCA) approach or the Nyström approximation method. Inthis work we show that extant LSH methods in this space suffer from a bias problem; thatmoreover is difficult to estimate apriori. Consequently; the LSH estimate of a kernel isdifferent from that of the KPCA/Nyström approximation. We provide theoretical rationale forthis bias; which is also confirmed empirically. We propose an LSH algorithm that can reducethis bias and consequently our approach can match the KPCA or the Nyström methods'estimation accuracy while retaining the traditional benefits of LSH.

One; Two; Hash! Counting Hash Tables for Flash Devices,Tyler Clemons; SM Faisal; Shirish Tatikonda; Charu Aggarwal; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract In recent years; advances in hardware technology have led to the increasingly widespread use of flash storage devices. Such devices have clear benefits over traditional harddrives in terms of latency of access; bandwidth; and random access capabilities particularlywhen reading data. However; there are some interesting tradeoffs. On a relative scale;writing to such devices can be expensive. This is because typical flash devices (NANDtechnology) are updated in blocks. A minor update to a given block requires the entire blockto be erased; also referred to as cleaned; followed by a re-writing of the block. On the otherhand; sequential writes can be two orders of magnitude faster than random writes. Inaddition; random writes are degrading to the life of the flash drive because each block cansupport only a limited number of cleaning operations.

Identifying protein complexes in AP-MS data with negative evidence via soft Markov clustering,Yu-Keng Shih; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract Protein complexes are key units to discover protein mechanism. Traditional proteincomplex identification methods adopt a soft (overlapping) network clustering algorithm onprotein-protein interaction network and predict the clusters as protein complexes. Recently;the AP-MS technique and the scoring method can measure the co-complex relationshipamong proteins. Unlike traditional PPI networks; AP-MS can provide negative evidencewhich indicates which proteins are unlikely to be in the same protein complex. However;most of existing network clustering algorithms cannot utilize this negative similarity score. Inthis paper; we propose a soft network clustering algorithm; SR-MCL-N; which can take intoaccount negative similarity scores. SR-MCL-N is a variation of a previous algorithm; SR-MCL; which is a network clustering algorithm based on the transition flow.

Power efficient throughput maximization in multi-hop wireless networks,Deepti Chafekar; VS Anil Kumar; Madhav V Marathe; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,We study the problem of total throughput maximization in arbitrary multi-hop wirelessnetworks; with constraints on the total power usage (denoted by PETM); when nodes havethe capability to adaptively choose their power levels; which is the case with softwaredefined radio devices. The underlying interference graph changes when power levelschange; making PETM a complex cross-layer optimization problem. We develop a linearprogramming formulation for this problem; that leads to a constant factor approximation tothe total throughput rate; for any given bound on the total power usage.

An efficient parallel tree mining algorithm for emerging commodity processors,Shirish Tatikonda; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; M Goyder,ABSTRACT With the advent of multi-core technology; it is becoming increasingly evident thatan effective parallel algorithm design is central to realize performance that is commensuratewith this advancement. Additionally; along with effective parallelization strategies; algorithmdesigners must not only worry about memory access latencies but also memory bandwidthsince technology constraints are likely to limit off-chip bandwidth to memory as one scalesup the number of cores per chip. As a step in this direction; from the perspective of datamining algorithm designs; in this article we consider the challenging problem of designingan efficient parallel algorithm for frequent tree mining. Our strawman solution (not a naiveone) relies on a well known bijection between a labeled rooted tree and a sequence andleverages the properties of this bijection to realize an algorithm that is inherently array …,Proceedings of the 13th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming,2008,1

Learning approximate MRFs from large transactional data,Chao Wang; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract In this abstract we address the problem of learning approximate Markov RandomFields (MRF) from large transactional data. Examples of such data include market basketdata; co-authorship networked data; etc. Such data can be represented by a binary datamatrix; with an entry (i; j) takes a value of one (zero) if the item j is (not) in the basket i.“Large”means that there can be many rows or columns in the data matrix. To model such dataeffectively in order to answer queries about the data efficiently; we consider the use ofprobabilistic models. In this abstract; we consider employing frequent itemsets to learnapproximate global MRFs on large transactional data.

A placement service for data mining centers,Gregory Buehrer; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,ABSTRACT In this article we describe a placement service for distributed data miningcenters. We seek to provide a service with sufficient generality to suit a variety of web miningand machine learning algorithms; yet one which offers properties beyond typical robustness;lookup; and extraction support for general applications. To accomplish this; we design theservice to incorporate locality of placement based on the similarity of records in the inputdata. Specifically; we propose to leverage hashing techniques with low computecomplexities to form small; highly similar groups of records which can then be assigned to amachine in the cluster based on the data currently residing on that machine. Thesubsequent increase in local neighborhoods for the resulting machine partitions canimprove mining executions for pattern discovery; nearest neighbor searching; and …,*,2007,1

Structural classification of glaucomatous optic neuropathy,Michael Duane Twa,Abstract Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Quantitative methods of imaging theoptic nerve head (eg confocal scanning laser tomography) are increasingly used todiagnose glaucomatous optic neuropathy and monitor its progression; yet there isconsiderable controversy about how to interpret and make best use of this structuralinformation. In this research; machine learning methods are proposed and evaluated asalternatives to current methods of disease classification. First; multiple mathematicalmodeling methods such as radial polynomials; wavelet analysis and B-spline fitting wereused to reconstruct topographic descriptions of the optic nerve head and peripapillaryregion. Next; features derived from these models were extracted and used as classificationfeatures for automated decision tree induction. Decision tree classification performance …,*,2006,1
Towards Object based Trajectory Representation and Analysis,Sameep Mehta; Raghu Machiraju; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,1. ABSTRACT In this article; we present trajectory representation and analysis algorithms fortangible object features found in temporally varying datasets. Rather than modeling thefeatures as points; we take attributes like shape and extent of the feature into account. Ourcontention is that these attributes play an important role in understanding the temporalevolution and interactions among features. The proposed representation scheme is basedon motion and shape parameters including linear velocity; angular velocity; etc. We usethese parameters to segment the trajectory instead of relying on the geometry of thetrajectory. Navigational and topological relationships can be readily derived from ourrepresentation. We also show how our scheme lends itself for predicting and understandinginteractions among features. We evaluate our algorithms on real datasets originating from …,OSUCISRC-03/06-TR30,2006,1

Exploiting recurring usage patterns to enhance filesystem and memory subsystem performance,Benjamin Rutt; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract In many cases; normal uses of a system form patterns that will repeat. The mostcommon patterns can be collected into a prediction model which will essentially predict thatusage patterns common in the past will occur again in the future. Systems can then use theprediction models to provide advance notice to their implementations about how they arelikely to be used in the near future. This technique creates opportunities to enhance systemimplementation performance since implementations can be better prepared to handleupcoming usage. The key component of our system is the ability to intelligently learn aboutsystem trends by tracking file system and memory system activity patterns. The usage datathat is tracked can be subsequently queried and visualized.

Incremental Techniques for Mining Dynamic and Distributed Databases,Matthew Eric Otey; Adriano Veloso; Chao Wang; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Wagner Meira Jr,Abstract Traditional methods for data mining typically make the assumptions that the data iscentralized and static. These assumptions are no longer tenable. Such methods imposeexcessive communication overhead when data is distributed. Also; they wastecomputational and I/O resources when data is dynamic. In this paper we present what webelieve to be the first data mining approach that overcomes all these assumptions. In fact;we consider a broader scenario in which the data is continuously updated and stored atgeographically different locations. This scenario imposes several challenges to data mining;especially those concerning performance and interactivity. Our approach makes use ofparallel and incremental techniques to generate frequent itemsets even in the presence ofdata updates without examining the entire database. It also imposes minimal …,The Third IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM’03); Melbourne; FL,2003,1

Analysis of streaming data from twitter social networks,Xintian Yang; Amol Ghoting; Yiye Ruan; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,ABSTRACT The Twitter social network is a dynamic network that can generate high speeddata streams. In Twitter; the users can subscribe to the contents shared by their friends. Thecontents are in the form of messages written by their authors. All the messages in thenetwork form a data stream and carry the highly dynamic behaviors of the users in theTwitter network. In this paper; we present our efforts to process the message stream ofTwitter. We believe that in order to efficiently perform analysis on streaming data; we needan in-memory summary of the streaming data which can be used as input to miningalgorithms. In this paper; we propose a novel summarization scheme to build such summaryof the streaming data. We empirically demonstrate that our method can effectivelysummarize message stream data from the Twitter social networks with limited memory …,*,*,1

MILE: A Multi-Level Framework for Scalable Graph Embedding,Jiongqian Liang; Saket Gurukar; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract: Recently there has been a surge of interest in designing graph embeddingmethods. Few; if any; can scale to a large-sized graph with millions of nodes due to bothcomputational complexity and memory requirements. In this paper; we relax this limitation byintroducing the MultI-Level Embedding (MILE) framework--a generic methodology allowingcontemporary graph embedding methods to scale to large graphs. MILE repeatedlycoarsens the graph into smaller ones using a hybrid matching technique to maintain thebackbone structure of the graph. It then applies existing embedding methods on the coarsestgraph and refines the embeddings to the original graph through a novel graph convolutionneural network that it learns. The proposed MILE framework is agnostic to the underlyinggraph embedding techniques and can be applied to many existing graph embedding …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.09612,2018,*
Prioritized Relationship Analysis in Heterogeneous Information Networks,Jiongqian Liang; Deepak Ajwani; Patrick K Nicholson; Alessandra Sala; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract An increasing number of applications are modeled and analyzed in network form;where nodes represent entities of interest and edges represent interactions or relationshipsbetween entities. Commonly; such relationship analysis tools assume homogeneity in bothnode type and edge type. Recent research has sought to redress the assumption ofhomogeneity and focused on mining heterogeneous information networks (HINs) whereboth nodes and edges can be of different types. Building on such efforts; in this work; wearticulate a novel approach for mining relationships across entities in such networks whileaccounting for user preference over relationship type and interestingness metric.

A Pareto Framework for Data Analytics on Heterogeneous Systems: Implications for Green Energy Usage and Performance,Aniket Chakrabarti; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Christopher Stewart,Distributed algorithms for data analytics partition their input data across many machines forparallel execution. At scale; it is likely that some machines will perform worse than othersbecause they are slower; power constrained or dependent on undesirable; dirty energysources. It is challenging to balance analytics workloads across heterogeneous machinesbecause the algorithms are sensitive to statistical skew in data partitions. A skewed partitioncan slow down the whole workload or degrade the quality of results. Sizing partitions inproportion to each machine's performance may introduce or further exacerbate skew. In thispaper; we propose a scheme that controls the statistical distribution of each partition andsizes partitions according to the heterogeneity of the computing environment.

Role Discovery in Graphs Using Global Features: Algorithms; Applications and a Novel Evaluation Strategy,Pratik Vinay Gupte; Balaraman Ravindran; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,In social network analysis; the fundamental idea behind the notion of roles is to discoveractors who have similar structural signatures. Actors performing the same role have similarbehavioural and functional characteristics. Few examples of structural roles are bridgenodes; clique members and star centers. Role discovery involves partitioning the nodes in anetwork based on their structural characteristics. The notion of roles is complementary to thenotion of community detection; which involves partitioning the network into cohesivesubgroups.

Adaptive Bayesian Sampling with Monte Carlo EM,Anirban Roychowdhury; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Abstract We present a novel technique for learning the mass matrices in samplers obtainedfrom discretized dynamics that preserve some energy function.

This leads to significant complexities in the energyreformulations and resultant dynamics; often leading to implicit systems of equations andrequiring inversion of high-dimensional matrices in the leapfrog steps. Our approachprovides a simpler alternative; by using existing dynamics in the sampling step of a MonteCarlo EM framework; and learning the mass matrices in the M step with a novel onlinetechnique.

This data can be stored inmultidimensional arrays and has been known to scale in the petabyte range. An obvioussolution is to distribute the data across many nodes and work in parallel. However;optimizing storage for space limitations and access; as well as optimizing in memoryexecution is not intuitive. Array Database Management Systems (ADBMS) can be used tostore these large datasets. This position paper will present an ADBMS supported by theGlobal Arrays framework that will allow users in both the scientific and data miningcommunities to efficiently store; access; and operate over large datasets in an easy to useframework we call GADBMS (Global-arrays Array Database Management System).,High Performance Computing; Networking; Storage and Analysis (SCC); 2012 SC Companion:,2012,*

There are at least two failuremodels: independent failure model and dependant failure model. The yield model describeswhether a semiconductor chip is defective or not. Upon completing the scheduling; the ATEstation conducts tests according to the scheduled test flow. The present invention can alsobe applied to software testing.,*,2011,*
Electrical Engineering & Computer Science Department,Sourya Roy; Tyler Clemons; SM Faisal; Ke Liu; Nikos Hardavellas; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,ABSTRACT Power dissipation and energy consumption have become one of the mostimportant problems in the design of processors today. This is especially true in power-constrained environments; such as embedded and mobile computing. While lowering theoperational voltage can reduce power consumption; there are limits imposed at design time;beyond which hardware components experience faulty operation. Moreover; the decrease infeature size has led to higher susceptibility to process variations; leading to reliability issuesand lowering yield. However; not all computations and all data in a workload need tomaintain 100% fidelity. In this paper; we explore the idea of employing functional or storageunits that let go the conservative guardbands imposed on the design to guarantee reliableexecution. Rather; these units exhibit Elastic Fidelity; by judiciously lowering the voltage …,*,2011,*
Elastic Fidelity,Sourya Roy; Nikos Hardavellas,Continued technology scaling in IC design has made power dissipation a major constraint inthe design of processors today. Although feature sizes are still scaling; voltage scaling hasnearly stopped due to high leakage currents associated with low threshold voltages. Thishas lead to a dramatic increase in power density with decreasing feature size [15]. On theother hand; the scaling of the feature sizes has made chips more susceptible to problems ofvariability and hardware faults. These faults originate from process variations; soft errors andwear outs; hampering reliable execution [1; 17]. Traditionally; the operating points ofprocessors have been determined by conservative guardbands based on worst-casescenarios. A guarband refers to the timing differential inserted into the hardware design toallow for signals to communicate without being perfectly aligned. However; this design …,*,2011,*

Constructing and Analyzing Biological Interaction Networks for Knowledge Discovery,Duygu Ucar,Abstract Many biological datasets can be effectively modeled as interaction networks wherenodes represent biological entities of interest such as proteins; genes; or complexes andedges mimic associations among them. The study of these biological network structures canprovide insight into many biological questions including the functional characterization ofgenes and gene products; the characterization of DNA-protein bindings; and theunderstanding of regulatory mechanisms. Therefore; the task of constructing biologicalinteraction networks from raw data sets and exploiting information from these networks iscritical; but is also fraught with challenges. First; the network structure is not always known ina priori; the structure should be inferred from raw and heterogeneous biological datasources.

A workflow for the modeling and analysis of biomedical data,Keith Allen Marsolo,Abstract The use of data mining techniques for the classification of shape and structure canprovide critical results when applied biomedical data. On a molecular level; an object'sstructure influences its function; so structure-based classification can lead to a notion offunctional similarity. On a more macro scale; anatomical features can define the pathology ofa disease; while changes in those features over time can illustrate its progression. Thus;structural analysis can play a vital role in clinical diagnosis. When examining the problem ofstructural or shape classification; one would like to develop a solution that satisfies a specifictask; yet is general enough to be applied elsewhere. In this work; we propose a workflowthat can be used to model and analyze biomedical data; both static and time-varying.

In this paper; we explore the use ofspatio-temporal association patterns to discover meaningful information in protein foldingtrajectories. We propose an approach that employs the simplicity of contact maps toeffectively analyze and utilize information in 3D folding simulations. Our method also allowsone to perform cross comparison of multiple trajectories to identify critical events or partialfolding pathways common to every trajectory.

As a result; data mining—the process of discovering hidden and usefulinformation in datasets—has been employed to facilitate the understanding of importantphenomena in such disciplines. Many approaches have been proposed to analyze spatialor spatio-temporal data. However; they often suffer from several major limitations. First; theyoften model spatial entities as points. However; this leads to a loss in information since thegeometric properties of such entities (or features) can play an important role in manyscientific applications.

Approaches to Abnormality Detection with Constraints,Matthew Eric Otey,Abstract A common problem in data analysis is that of discriminating between modes ofnormal behavior and modes of abnormal behavior. Of particular interest are techniques thatcan automatically detect abnormal activity in data. This is important since abnormal datamay be indicative of measurement error in scientific data; or malicious activity in securityaudit data. There are two basic approaches to the problem of automatically findingabnormalities. The first is known as signature detection; which involves finding knownpatterns of abnormality in a database. However; it has the drawback of not being able todetect abnormalities for which there is no prior information. The second approach is knownas anomaly detection; which involves building a model of normal data and then searchingfor patterns that do not fit this model. Unlike the signature detection approach; it is able to …,*,2006,*
An ensemble approach for clustering protein-protein interaction networks,Sitaram Asur; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Duygu Ucar,Abstract Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks are believed to be important sources ofinformation related to biological processes and complex metabolic functions of the cell. Thepresence of biologically relevant functional modules in PPI networks has been theorized bymany researchers. However; PPI networks are known to contain noisy false positiveinteractions and possess the scale-free property; which makes the task of isolating theseuseful modules difficult. In this paper; we propose an ensemble clustering approach toaddress this problem. To perform initial clustering; we examine three topology-baseddistance metrics that are conducive for partitioning these networks. To perform consensusclustering; we develop a PCA-based hypergraph approach; designed to handle largeinteraction networks. We also develop a soft consensus clustering method to assign …,*,2006,*

Annual Report on NSF ESS Grant CCR-9705594 Integrated Software Shared Memory for Next-Generation Networks fiscal year 1998-1999,Michael L Scott; Sandhya Dwarkadas,It is widely accepted today that small-scale symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs) provide thebest performance per dollar of any computing platform; and that shared memory providesthe most desirable programming paradigm for parallel computing. Large-scale shared-memory systems can be supported via directory-based cache-coherent hardware or viasoftware emulation of shared memory on top of message-passing hardware. Hardwarecoherence is usually faster; but software is cheaper and more easily customized. Softwarecoherence may also be attractive on a large cache-coherent machine if the operating systemdoes not support a system-wide shared address space. Unfortunately; software distributedshared memory (S-DSM) has traditionally provided acceptable performance for only alimited class of applications.

Parallel Algorithms for Discovery of Association Rules MOHAMMED J. AKI zaki@ cs. rochester. edu SRINIVASAN PARTHASARATHY srini@ cs. rochester. edu,MITS NORI OGIHARA; WEI LI,Abstract. Discovery of association rules is an important data mining task. Several paralleland sequential algorithms have been proposed in the literature to solve this problem. Almostall of these algorithms make repeated passes over the database to determine the set offrequent itemsets (a subset of database items); thus incurring high I/O overhead. In theparallel case; most algorithms perform a sum-reduction at the end of each pass to constructthe global counts; also incurring high synchronization cost. In this paper we describe newparallel association mining algorithms. The algorithms use novel itemset clusteringtechniques to approximate the set of potentially maximal frequent itemsets. Once this set hasbeen identified; the algorithms make use of efficient traversal techniques to generate thefrequent itemsets contained in each cluster. We propose two clustering schemes based …,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,1997,*

An E cient Algorithm for Concurrent Priority Queue Heaps,Galen C Hunt Maged M Michael; Srinivasan Parthasarathy Michael L Scott,Abstract We present a new algorithm for concurrent access to array-based priority queueheaps. Deletions proceed top-down as they do in a previous algorithm due to Rao andKumar 6]; but insertions proceed bottom-up; and consecutive insertions use a bit-reversaltechnique to scatter accesses across the fringe of the tree; to reduce contention. Becauseinsertions do not have to traverse the entire height of the tree (as they do in previous work);as many as O (M) operations can proceed in parallel; rather than O (logM) on a heap of sizeM. Experimental results on a Silicon Graphics Challenge multiprocessor demonstrate goodoverall performance for the new algorithm on small heaps; and signi cant performanceimprovements over known alternatives on large heaps with mixed insertion/deletionworkloads.

Mining Reliable Models of Associations in Dynamic Databases,Adriano A Veloso Wagner Meira Jr; Márcio LB de Carvalho,Abstract Most current work on data mining has been focused on devising efficienttechniques to build accurate models from databases. Research on how the accuracy of amodel changes as a function of dynamic updates when the databases are collected overtime is lacking. In this work we show that extracting this information: knowing which aspectsof the model are changing and how they are changing as a function of data updates; can bevery effective for accuracy purposes. In this paper we consider the problem of generatingreliable models within the context of association mining; a key data mining task. A model isreliable when it does not lose accuracy and predictive power over time. This is a challengingproblem because a model; no matter how accurate; can only predict based on associationsmined in the old data. That is; a model requires a semi-stable environment; otherwise it …,*,*,*

For an n-node graph with e-edges; weincrementally maintain an in-memory min-wise neighbor sampled sub-graph; bounded by auser configurable memory limit. This sketch representation; capable of handling real-timeedge streaming rate; lowers the memory requirement to O (n) instead of O (e); making itparticularly useful for streaming graphs commonly with e≫ n; with both n and e possiblyunknown apriori. Symmetrization and similarity-based techniques can recover from thesedata structures a significant portion of the original graph. With bounded memory; the qualityof results using the sketch representation is competitive against baselines which use the fullgraph; and the computational performance is often significantly better.

Software Shared Memory Support on Clusters of Symmetric MultiProcessors Using Remote-Write Networks,Robert Stets; Sandhya Dwarkadas; Nikolaos Hardavellas; Galen Hunt; Leonidas Kontothanassis; Srinivasan Parthasarathy; Michael Scott,Abstract Low-latency; remote-write-access networks have recently become commodityitems. These networks can connect clusters of symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs) to formvery cost-effective; large scale parallel systems. Software-based distributed shared memory(SDSM) is a natural choice for the underlying platform. However; to exploit the platform's fullpotential; sharing across SMPs must be managed without compromising the efficiency ofsharing within an SMP. Cashmere-2L is a “two-level” SDSM protocol that delivers theplatform's potential through novel software techniques that leverage; without compromising;the efficiency of the hardware coherence. The protocol implements a moderately lazyrelease consistency model with page directories; home-nodes; and multiple concurrentwriters. By avoiding global meta-data locks and TLB shootdown; Cashmere-2L is able to …,*,*,*

Directional Component Detection via Markov Clustering in Directed Networks,Yu-Keng Shih; Sungmin Kim; Tao Shi; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,ABSTRACT Community detection has been one of the fundamental problems in networkanalysis. Past studies mainly focused on detecting communities in undirected networks.However; several real networks are directed; eg World Wide Web; paper citation networksand Twitter's follower-followee network. Although some studies proposed algorithms fordirected networks; few of them considered that nodes play two different roles; source andterminal; in a directed network. In this paper; we adopt a novel concept of communities;directional components; and propose a new algorithm based on Markov Clustering to detectdirectional components in a directed network. We then compare our algorithm; Dual R-MCL;on synthetic networks with two recent algorithms also designed for detecting directionalcomponents.

A Review of “Customized Dynamic Load Balancing for a Network of Workstations”,Mohammed Javeed Zaki; Wei Li; Srinivasan Parthasarathy,With the rapid advances in computational power; speed; cost; memory; and high-speednetwork technologies; a “Network of Workstations” provides an attractive scalable alternativecompared to custom parallel machines. Scalable distributed shared-memory architecturesrely on the ability for each processor to maintain a load balance. Load balancing involvesassigning each processor a proportional amount of work bases on its performance; therebyminimizing total execution time of the program. There are two types of load balancing; staticand dynamic. Static load balancing allows the programmer to delegate responsibility to eachprocessor before run time. The simplest approach is the static block-scheduling scheme;which assigns equal blocks of iterations to each of the processors. Another scheme of staticload balancing is the static interleaved scheme; which assigns iteration in a cyclic fashion …,*,*,*

Though a lot of patterns have been found using ad-hoc methods;there is no systematic approach to find all the important structures in proteins. Here we try toestablish such a method to efficiently find the important structures within a protein. Wediscover these patterns building up from the atom level using data mining techniques. Initialresults show that this method is quite adept at deriving important high-level structuresranging from the backbone peptide bond plane to the basic structures that make up a α-helixstructure.,*,*,*

The challenge inpattern mining is to find all possible groups of items or values which occur in at least σobjects of a database; where σ is user specified parameter. In this work; we show that thestate-of-the-art frequent pattern mining algorithms are inefficient when executing on ashared memory multiprocessor system; due primarily to poor utilization of the memoryhierarchy. To improve the efficiency of such algorithms; we propose novel techniquesdesigned to afford effective parallelization. Specifically; we present memory performanceimprovements; task partitioning strategies; and task queuing models designed to maximizethe scalability of pattern mining on SMP systems.
