Collective spatial keyword querying,Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract With the proliferation of geo-positioning and geo-tagging; spatial web objects thatpossess both a geographical location and a textual description are gaining in prevalence;and spatial keyword queries that exploit both location and textual description are gaining inprominence. However; the queries studied so far generally focus on finding individualobjects that each satisfy a query rather than finding groups of objects where the objects in agroup collectively satisfy a query. We define the problem of retrieving a group of spatial webobjects such that the group's keywords cover the query's keywords and such that objects arenearest to the query location and have the lowest inter-object distances. Specifically; westudy two variants of this problem; both of which are NP-complete. We devise exact solutionsas well as approximate solutions with provable approximation bounds to the problems …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,295
Mining significant semantic locations from GPS data,Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen,Abstract With the increasing deployment and use of GPS-enabled devices; massiveamounts of GPS data are becoming available. We propose a general framework for themining of semantically meaningful; significant locations; eg; shopping malls and restaurants;from such data. We present techniques capable of extracting semantic locations from GPSdata. We capture the relationships between locations and between locations and users witha graph. Significance is then assigned to locations using random walks over the graph thatpropagates significance among the locations. In doing so; mutual reinforcement betweenlocation significance and user authority is exploited for determining significance; as areaspects such as the number of visits to a location; the durations of the visits; and thedistances users travel to reach locations. Studies using up to 100 million GPS records …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,280
Retrieving top-k prestige-based relevant spatial web objects,Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen,Abstract The location-aware keyword query returns ranked objects that are near a querylocation and that have textual descriptions that match query keywords. This query occursinherently in many types of mobile and traditional web services and applications; eg; YellowPages and Maps services. Previous work considers the potential results of such a query asbeing independent when ranking them. However; a relevant result object with nearbyobjects that are also relevant to the query is likely to be preferable over a relevant objectwithout relevant nearby objects. The paper proposes the concept of prestige-basedrelevance to capture both the textual relevance of an object to a query and the effects ofnearby objects. Based on this; a new type of query; the Location-aware top-k Prestige-basedText retrieval (LkPT) query; is proposed that retrieves the top-k spatial web objects ranked …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,214
Spatial Keyword Querying,Xin Cao; Lisi Chen; Gao Cong; Christian Jensen; Qiang Qu; Anders Skovsgaard; Dingming Wu; Man Yiu,Abstract The web is increasingly being used by mobile users. In addition; it is increasinglybecoming possible to accurately geo-position mobile users and web content. Thisdevelopment gives prominence to spatial web data management. Specifically; a spatialkeyword query takes a user location and user-supplied keywords as arguments and returnsweb objects that are spatially and textually relevant to these arguments. This paper reviewsrecent results by the authors that aim to achieve spatial keyword querying functionality that iseasy to use; relevant to users; and can be supported efficiently.

The use of categorization information in language models for question retrieval,Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Bin Cui; Christian Søndergaard Jensen; Ce Zhang,Abstract Community Question Answering (CQA) has emerged as a popular type of servicemeeting a wide range of information needs. Such services enable users to ask and answerquestions and to access existing question-answer pairs. CQA archives contain very largevolumes of valuable user-generated content and have become important informationresources on the Web. To make the body of knowledge accumulated in CQA archivesaccessible; effective and efficient question search is required. Question search in a CQAarchive aims to retrieve historical questions that are relevant to new questions posed byusers. This paper proposes a category-based framework for search in CQA archives.

Keyword-aware optimal route search,Xin Cao; Lisi Chen; Gao Cong; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract Identifying a preferable route is an important problem that finds applications in mapservices. When a user plans a trip within a city; the user may want to find" a most popularroute such that it passes by shopping mall; restaurant; and pub; and the travel time to andfrom his hotel is within 4 hours." However; none of the algorithms in the existing work onroute planning can be used to answer such queries. Motivated by this; we define theproblem of keyword-aware optimal route query; denoted by KOR; which is to find an optimalroute such that it covers a set of user-specified keywords; a specified budget constraint issatisfied; and an objective score of the route is optimal. The problem of answering KORqueries is NP-hard. We devise an approximation algorithm OSScaling with provableapproximation bounds. Based on this algorithm; another more efficient approximation …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,55
Temporal spatial-keyword top-k publish/subscribe,Lisi Chen; Gao Cong; Xin Cao; Kian-Lee Tan,Massive amount of data that are geo-tagged and associated with text information are beinggenerated at an unprecedented scale. These geo-textual data cover a wide range of topics.Users are interested in receiving up-to-date tweets such that their locations are close to auser specified location and their texts are interesting to users. For example; a user may wantto be updated with tweets near her home on the topic “food poisoning vomiting.” Weconsider the Temporal Spatial-Keyword Top-k Subscription (TaSK) query. Given a TaSKquery; we continuously maintain up-to-date top-k most relevant results over a stream of geo-textual objects (eg; geo-tagged Tweets) for the query.

A Foundation for Efficient Indoor Distance-Aware Query Processing,Hua Lu; Xin Cao; Christian S Jensen,Indoor spaces accommodate large numbers of spatial objects; eg; points of interest (POIs);and moving populations. A variety of services; eg; location-based services and securitycontrol; are relevant to indoor spaces. Such services can be improved substantially if theyare capable of utilizing indoor distances. However; existing indoor space models do notaccount well for indoor distances. To address this shortcoming; we propose a datamanagement infrastructure that captures indoor distance and facilitates distance-awarequery processing. In particular; we propose a distance-aware indoor space model thatintegrates indoor distance seamlessly. To enable the use of the model as a foundation forquery processing; we develop accompanying; efficient algorithms that compute indoordistances for different indoor entities like doors as well as locations.

Users may want to be notified of interestinggeo-textual objects during a period of time. For example; a user may want to be informedwhen tweets containing term" garage sale" are posted within 5 km of the user's home in thenext 72 hours. In this paper; for the first time we study the problem of matching a stream ofincoming Boolean Range Continuous queries over a stream of incoming geo-textual objectsin real time.

Efficient Algorithms for Answering the m-Closest Keywords Query,Tao Guo; Xin Cao; Gao Cong,Abstract As an important type of spatial keyword query; the m-closest keywords (mCK) queryfinds a group of objects such that they cover all query keywords and have the smallestdiameter; which is defined as the largest distance between any pair of objects in the group.The query is useful in many applications such as detecting locations of web resources.However; the existing work does not study the intractability of this problem and only providesexact algorithms; which are computationally expensive. In this paper; we prove that theproblem of answering mCK queries is NP-hard. We first devise a greedy algorithm that hasan approximation ratio of 2. Then; we observe that an mCK query can be approximatelyanswered by finding the circle with the smallest diameter that encloses a group of objectstogether covering all query keywords. We prove that the group enclosed in the circle can …,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,29
Retrieving regions of interest for user exploration,Xin Cao; Gao Cong; Christian S Jensen; Man Lung Yiu,Abstract We consider an application scenario where points of interest (PoIs) each have aweb presence and where a web user wants to identify a region that contains relevant PoIsthat are relevant to a set of keywords; eg; in preparation for deciding where to go toconveniently explore the PoIs. Motivated by this; we propose the length-constrainedmaximum-sum region (LCMSR) query that returns a spatial-network region that is locatedwithin a general region of interest; that does not exceed a given size constraint; and that bestmatches query keywords. Such a query maximizes the total weight of the PoIs in it wrt thequery keywords. We show that it is NP-hard to answer this query. We develop anapproximation algorithm with a (5+ ε) approximation ratio utilizing a technique that scalesnode weights into integers.

KORS: Keyword-aware Optimal Route Search System,Xin Cao; Lisi Chen; Gao Cong; Jihong Guan; Nhan-Tue Phan; Xiaokui Xiao,We present the Keyword-aware Optimal Route Search System (KORS); which efficientlyanswers the KOR queries. A KOR query is to find a route such that it covers a set of user-specified keywords; a specified budget constraint is satisfied; and an objective score of theroute is optimized. Consider a tourist who wants to spend a day exploring a city. The usermay issue the following KOR query:“find the most popular route such that it passes byshopping mall; restaurant; and pub; and the travel time to and from her hotel is within 4hours.” KORS provides browser-based interfaces for desktop and laptop computers andprovides a client application for mobile devices as well. The interfaces and the client enableusers to formulate queries and view the query results on a map. Queries are then sent to theserver for processing by the HTTP post operation.

Maximizing bichromatic reverse spatial and textual k nearest neighbor queries,Farhana M Choudhury; J Shane Culpepper; Timos Sellis; Xin Cao,Abstract The problem of maximizing bichromatic reverse k nearest neighbor queries(BRkNN) has been extensively studied in spatial databases. In this work; we present arelated query for spatial-textual databases that finds an optimal location; and a set ofkeywords that maximizes the size of bichromatic reverse spatial textual k nearest neighbors(MaxBRSTkNN). Such a query has many practical applications including social mediaadvertisements where a limited number of relevant advertisements are displayed to eachuser. The problem is to find the location and the text contents to include in an advertisementso that it will be displayed to the maximum number of users. The increasing availability ofspatial-textual collections allows us to answer these queries for both spatial proximity andtextual similarity. This paper is the first to consider the MaxBRSTkNN query.

Optimal Route Search with the Coverage of Users' Preferences.,Yifeng Zeng; Xuefeng Chen; Xin Cao; Shengchao Qin; Marc Cavazza; Yanping Xiang,Abstract The preferences of users are important in route search and planning. For example;when a user plans a trip within a city; their preferences can be expressed as keywordsshopping mall; restaurant; and museum; with weights 0.5; 0.4; and 0.1; respectively. Theresulting route should best satisfy their weighted preferences. In this paper; we take intoaccount the weighted user preferences in route search; and present a keyword coverageproblem; which finds an optimal route from a source location to a target location such thatthe keyword coverage is optimized and that the budget score satisfies a specified constraint.We prove that this problem is NP-hard. To solve this complex problem; we propose anoptimal route search based on an A* variant for which we have defined an admissibleheuristic function.

Group-based collective keyword querying in road networks,Sen Su; Sen Zhao; Xiang Cheng; Rong Bi; Xin Cao; Jie Wang,Abstract This paper addresses a group-based collective keyword (GBCK) query problem inroad networks. We model the road network as an undirected graph; where each nodelocating in a two-dimensional space represents a road intersection or a Points of Interest(POI); and each edge with weight represents a road segment. The GBCK query aims to finda region containing a set of POIs that covers all the query keywords and these POIs areclose to the group of users and are close to each other. We show the problem of answeringthe GBCK query is NP-hard. To solve this problem; we develop a series of query processingalgorithms. We first propose an efficient algorithm; which gives a 5-factor approximation tofind a feasible region. The cost of this region is further used to limit the search space in theother algorithms. We then propose an exact algorithm; and an approximate algorithm with …,Information Processing Letters,2017,3

Accelerating large scale centroid-based clustering with locality sensitive hashing,Ryan McConville; Xin Cao; Weiru Liu; Paul Miller,Most traditional data mining algorithms struggle to cope with the sheer scale of dataefficiently. In this paper; we propose a general framework to accelerate existing algorithms tocluster large-scale datasets which contain large numbers of attributes; items; and clusters.Our framework makes use of locality sensitive hashing to significantly reduce the clustersearch space. We also theoretically prove that our framework has a guaranteed error boundin terms of the clustering quality. This framework can be applied to a set of centroid-basedclustering algorithms that assign an object to the most similar cluster; and we adopt thepopular K-Modes categorical clustering algorithm to present how the framework can beapplied. We validated our framework with five synthetic datasets and a real world Yahoo!Answers dataset.

Spatial keyword querying beyond the single geo-textual object granularity,Xin Cao,With the proliferation of geo-positioning techniques and mobile devices such as smart-phones and tablet computers; the web is increasingly being used by mobile users andaccurate user positioning is increasingly available. As a result; a spatial; or geographicalweb is emerging where contents and users are associated with locations. This leads to thefact that massive amounts of objects are available on the web that possess both ageographical location and a textual description. Such geo-textual objects include stores;tourist attractions; hotels; restaurants; businesses; entertainment services; public transport;etc. The availability of substantial amounts of geo-textual objects gives prominence to spatialkeyword queries that target these objects. Such queries exploit both locations and textualdescriptions and occur in many types of mobile and traditional web services and …,*,2014,*
