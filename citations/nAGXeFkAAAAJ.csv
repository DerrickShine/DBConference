Protecting respondents identities in microdata release,Pierangela Samarati,Today's globally networked society places great demands on the dissemination and sharingof information. While in the past released information was mostly in tabular and statisticalform; many situations call for the release of specific data (microdata). In order to protect theanonymity of the entities (called respondents) to which information refers; data holders oftenremove or encrypt explicit identifiers such as names; addresses; and phone numbers.Deidentifying data; however; provides no guarantee of anonymity. Released informationoften contains other data; such as race; birth date; sex; and ZIP code; that can be linked topublicly available information to reidentify respondents and inferring information that was notintended for disclosure. In this paper we address the problem of releasing microdata whilesafeguarding the anonymity of respondents to which the data refer. The approach is …,IEEE transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2001,2076
Access control: Principles and practice,RS Sandhu; P Samarati,Access control constrains what a user can do directly; as well as what programs executingon behalf of the users are allowed to do. In this way access control seeks to prevent activitythat could lead to a breach of security. This article explains access control and itsrelationship to other security services such as authentication; auditing; and administration. Itthen reviews the access matrix model and describes different approaches to implementingthe access matrix in practical systems; and follows with a discussion of access controlpolicies commonly found in current systems; and a brief consideration of access controladministration.,IEEE Communications Magazine,1994,1445
Protecting privacy when disclosing information: k-anonymity and its enforcement through generalization and suppression,Pierangela Samarati; Latanya Sweeney,Abstract Today's globally networked society places great demand on the dissemination andsharing of person-speci c data. Situations where aggregate statistical information was oncethe reporting norm now rely heavily on the transfer of microscopically detailed transactionand encounter information. This happens at a time when more and more historically publicinformation is also electronically available. When these data are linked together; theyprovide an electronic shadow of a person or organization that is as identifying and personalas a ngerprint; even when the sources of the information contains no explicit identi ers; suchas name and phone number. In order to protect the anonymity of individuals to whomreleased data refer; data holders often remove or encrypt explicit identi ers such as names;addresses and phone numbers.

A reputation-based approach for choosing reliable resources in peer-to-peer networks,Ernesto Damiani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati; Fabio Violante,Abstract Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications have seen an enormous success; and recentlyintroduced P2P services have reached tens of millions of users. A feature that significantlycontributes to the success of many P2P applications is user anonymity. However; anonymityopens the door to possible misuses and abuses; exploiting the P2P network as a way tospread tampered with resources; including Trojan Horses; viruses; and spam. To addressthis problem we propose a self-regulating system where the P2P network is used toimplement a robust reputation mechanism. Reputation sharing is realized through adistributed polling algorithm by which resource requestors can assess the reliability of aresource offered by a participant before initiating the download. This way; spreading ofmalicious contents will be reduced and eventually blocked. Our approach can be …,Proceedings of the 9th ACM conference on Computer and communications security,2002,890
Flexible support for multiple access control policies,Sushil Jajodia; Pierangela Samarati; Maria Luisa Sapino; VS Subrahmanian,Abstract Although several access control policies can be devised for controlling access toinformation; all existing authorization models; and the corresponding enforcementmechanisms; are based on a specific policy (usually the closed policy). As a consequence;although different policy choices are possible in theory; in practice only a specific policy canactually be applied within a given system. In this paper; we present a unified framework thatcan enforce multiple access control policies within a single system. The framework is basedon a language through which users can specify security policies to be enforced on specificaccesses. The language allows the specification of both positive and negativeauthorizations and incorporates notions of authorization derivation; conflict resolution; anddecision strategies. Different strategies may be applied to different users; groups; objects …,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2001,795
Access control: Policies; models; and mechanisms,Pierangela Samarati; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati,Abstract Access control is the process of mediating every request to resources and datamaintained by a system and determining whether the request should be granted or denied.The access control decision is enforced by a mechanism implementing regulationsestablished by a security policy. Different access control policies can be applied;corresponding to different criteria for defining what should; and what should not; be allowed;and; in some sense; to different definitions of what ensuring security means. In this chapterwe investigate the basic concepts behind access control design and enforcement; and pointout different security requirements that may need to be taken into consideration. We discussseveral access control policies; and models formalizing them; that have been proposed inthe literature or that are currently under investigation.,*,2001,785

Generalizing data to provide anonymity when disclosing information,Pierangela Samarati; Latanya Sweeney,Abstract The proliferation of information on the Internet and access to fast computers withlarge storage capacities has increased the volume of information collected anddisseminated about individuals. The existence os these other data sources makes it mucheasier to re-identify individuals whose private information is released in data believed to beanonymous. At the same time; increasing demands are made on organizations to releaseindividualized data rather than aggregate statistical information. Even when explicitidentifiers; such as name and phone number; are removed or encrypted when releasingindividualized data; other characteristic data; which we term quasi-identifiers; can existwhich allow the data recipient to re-identify individuals to whom the data refer.

A fine-grained access control system for XML documents,Ernesto Damiani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Web-based applications greatly increase information availability and ease ofaccess; which is optimal for public information. The distribution and sharing of informationvia the Web that must be accessed in a selective way; such as electronic commercetransactions; require the definition and enforcement of security controls; ensuring thatinformation will be accessible only to authorized entities. Different approaches have beenproposed that address the problem of protecting information in a Web system. However;these approaches typically operate at the file-system level; independently of the data thathave to be protected from unauthorized accesses.

A logical language for expressing authorizations,Sushil Jajodia; Pierangela Samarati; VS Subrahmanian,A major drawback of existing access control systems is that they have all been developedwith a specific access control policy in mind. This means that all protection requirements (ieaccesses to be allowed or denied) must be specified in terms of the policy enforced by thesystem. While this may be trivial for some requirements; specification of other requirementsmay become quite complex or even impossible. The reason for this is that a single policysimply cannot capture the different protection requirements that users may need to enforceon different data. In this paper; we take a first step towards a model that is able to supportdifferent access control policies. We propose a logical language for the specification ofauthorizations on which such a model can be based.

A modular approach to composing access control policies,Piero Bonatti; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Pierangela Samarati,ABSTRACT Despite considerable advancements in the area of access control andauthorization languages; current approaches to enforcing access control are all based onmonolithic and complete specifications. This results limiting when restrictions to be enforcedcome from different input requirements; possibly under the control of different authorities;and where the specifics of some requirements may not even be known a priori. Turningindividual specifications into a coherent policy to be fed into the access control systemrequires a nontrivial combination and translation process. We address the problem ofcombining authorization specifications that may be independently stated; possibly indifferent languages and according to different policies. We propose an algebra of securitypolicies together with its formal semantics and illustrate how to formulate complex policies …,Proceedings of the 7th ACM conference on Computer and communications security,2000,478
Over-encryption: management of access control evolution on outsourced data,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Data outsourcing is emerging today as a successful paradigm allowing users andorganizations to exploit external services for the distribution of resources. A crucial problemto be addressed in this context concerns the enforcement of selective authorization policiesand the support of policy updates in dynamic scenarios. In this paper; we present a novelsolution to the enforcement of access control and the management of its evolution. Ourproposal is based on the application of selective encryption as a means to enforceauthorizations. Two layers of encryption are imposed on data: the inner layer is imposed bythe owner for providing initial protection; the outer layer is imposed by the server to reflectpolicy modifications. The combination of the two layers provides an efficient and robustsolution. The paper presents a model; an algorithm for the management of the two layers …,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,450

It then becomes of primary importance to provide means of protecting the secrecyof the information; while guaranteeing its availability to legitimate clients. Operating on-linequerying services securely on open networks is very difficult; therefore many enterprisesoutsource their data center operations to external application service providers. A promisingdirection towards prevention of unauthorized access to outsourced data is represented byencryption.

An access control model supporting periodicity constraints and temporal reasoning,Elisa Bertino; Claudio Bettini; Elena Ferrari; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Access control models; such as the ones supported by commercial DBMSs; are notyet able to fully meet many application needs. An important requirement derives from thetemporal dimension that permissions have in many real-world situations. Permissions areoften limited in time or may hold only for specific periods of time. In this article; we present anaccess control model in which periodic temporal intervals are associated withauthorizations. An authorization is automatically granted in the specified intervals andrevoked when such intervals expire. Deductive temporal rules with periodicity and orderconstraints are provided to derive new authorizations based on the presence or absence ofother authorizations in specific periods of time.

This information sharing anddissemination process is clearly selective. Indeed; if on the one hand there is a need todisseminate some data; there is on the other hand an equally strong need to protect thosedata that; for various reasons; should not be disclosed. Consider; for example; the case of aprivate organization making available various data regarding its business (products; sales;and so on); but at the same time wanting to protect more sensitive information; such as theidentity of its customers or plans for future products.

Combining fragmentation and encryption to protect privacy in data storage,Valentina Ciriani; Sabrina De Capitani Di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract The impact of privacy requirements in the development of modern applications isincreasing very quickly. Many commercial and legal regulations are driving the need todevelop reliable solutions for protecting sensitive information whenever it is stored;processed; or communicated to external parties. To this purpose; encryption techniques arecurrently used in many scenarios where data protection is required since they provide alayer of protection against the disclosure of personal information; which safeguardscompanies from the costs that may arise from exposing their data to privacy breaches.However; dealing with encrypted data may make query processing more expensive.

Supporting location-based conditions in access control policies,Claudio A Ardagna; Marco Cremonini; Ernesto Damiani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Location-based Access Control (LBAC) techniques allow taking users' physicallocation into account when determining their access privileges. In this paper; we present anapproach to LBAC aimed at integrating location-based conditions along with a genericaccess control model; so that a requestor can be granted or denied access by checking herlocation as well as her credentials. Our LBAC model includes a novel way of taking intoaccount the limitations of the technology used to ascertain the location of the requester.Namely; we describe how location verification can be encapsulated as a service;representing location technologies underlying it in terms of two semantically uniform servicelevel agreement (SLA) parameters called confidence and timeout.

A flexible authorization mechanism for relational data management systems,Elisa Bertino; Sushil Jajodia; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract In this article; we present an authorization model that can be used to express anumber of discretionary access control policies for relational data management systems.The model permits both positive and negative authorizations and supports exceptions at thesame time. The model is flexible in that the users can specify; for each authorization theygrant; whether the authorization can allow for exceptions or whether it must be stronglyobeyed. It provides authorization management for groups with exceptions at any level of thegroup hierarchy; and temporary suspension of authorizations. The model supportsownership together with decentralized administration of authorizations. Administrativeprivileges can also be restricted so that owners retain control over their tables.,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),1999,167
An extended authorization model for relational databases,Elisa Bertino; Pierangela Samarati; Sushil Jajodia,We propose two extensions to the authorization model for relational databases definedoriginally by PG Griffiths and B. Wade (1976). The first extension concerns a new type ofrevoke operation; called noncascading revoke operation. The original model contains asingle; cascading revoke operation; meaning that when a privilege is revoked from a user; arecursive revocation takes place that deletes all authorizations granted by this user that donot have other supporting authorizations. The new type of revocation avoids the recursiverevocation of authorizations. The second extension concerns negative authorization whichpermits specification of explicit denial for a user to access an object under a particular mode.We also address the management of views and groups with respect to the proposedextensions.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1997,160

A temporal access control mechanism for database systems,Elisa Bertino; Claudio Bettini; Elena Ferrari; Pierangela Samarati,The paper presents a discretionary access control model in which authorizations containtemporal intervals of validity. An authorization is automatically revoked when the associatedtemporal interval expires. The proposed model provides rules for the automatic derivation ofnew authorizations from those explicitly specified. Both positive and negative authorizationsare supported. A formal definition of those concepts is presented; together with the semanticinterpretation of authorizations and derivation rules as clauses of a general logic program.Issues deriving from the presence of negative authorizations are discussed. We also allownegation in rules: it is possible to derive new authorizations on the basis of the absence ofother authorizations. The presence of this type of rule may lead to the generation of differentsets of authorizations; depending on the evaluation order.

Data protection in outsourcing scenarios: Issues and directions,Pierangela Samarati; Sabrina De Capitani Di Vimercati,Abstract Data outsourcing is an emerging paradigm that allows users and companies to givetheir (potentially sensitive) data to external servers that then become responsible for theirstorage; management; and dissemination. Although data outsourcing provides manybenefits; especially for parties with limited resources for managing an ever more increasingamount of data; it introduces new privacy and security concerns. In this paper we discuss themain privacy issues to be addressed in data outsourcing; ranging from data confidentiality todata utility. We then illustrate the main research directions being investigated for providingeffective data protection to data externally stored and for enabling their querying.,Proceedings of the 5th ACM Symposium on Information; Computer and Communications Security,2010,157

However; concerns havebeen raised about the possibility that malicious users can exploit the network to spreadtampered-with resources (eg; malicious programs and viruses). A considerable amount ofresearch has thus focused on the development of trust and reputation models in P2Pnetworks. In this article; we propose to use fuzzy techniques in the design of reputationsystems based on collecting and aggregating peers' opinions. Fuzzy techniques are used inthe evaluation and synthesis of all the opinions expressed by peers.

Encryption policies for regulating access to outsourced data,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Current access control models typically assume that resources are under the strictcustody of a trusted party which monitors each access request to verify if it is compliant withthe specified access control policy. There are many scenarios where this approach isbecoming no longer adequate. Many clear trends in Web technology are creating a need forowners of sensitive information to manage access to it by legitimate users using the servicesof honest but curious third parties; that is; parties trusted with providing the required servicebut not authorized to read the actual data content. In this scenario; the data owner encryptsthe data before outsourcing and stores them at the server. Only the data owner and userswith knowledge of the key will be able to decrypt the data.

A data outsourcing architecture combining cryptography and access control,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Data outsourcing is becoming today a successful solution that allows users andorganizations to exploit external servers for the distribution of resources. Some of the mostchallenging issues in such a scenario are the enforcement of authorization policies and thesupport of policy updates. Since a common approach for protecting the outsourced dataconsists in encrypting the data themselves; a promising approach for solving these issues isbased on the combination of access control with cryptography. This idea is in itself not new;but the problem of applying it in an outsourced architecture introduces several challenges. Inthis paper; we first illustrate the basic principles on which an architecture for combiningaccess control and cryptography can be built. We then illustrate an approach for enforcingauthorization policies and supporting dynamic authorizations; allowing policy changes …,Proceedings of the 2007 ACM workshop on Computer security architecture,2007,135

This sharing process inevitably opens the local system to newvulnerabilities and enlarges the space of possible threats to the data and resources itmaintains. As a complicating factor; in general; data sources are heterogeneous both in thedata models they adopt and in the security models by which protection requirements arestated.

An authorization model for a distributed hypertext system,Pierangela Samarati; Elisa Bertino; Sushil Jajodia,Digital libraries support quick and efficient access to a large number of information sourcesthat are distributed but interlinked. As the amount of information to be shared grows; theneed to restrict access only to specific users or for specific usage will surely arise. Theprotection of information in digital libraries; however; is difficult because of the peculiarity ofthe hypertext paradigm which is generally used to represent information in digital libraries;together with the fact that related data in a hypertext are often distributed at different sites.We present an authorization model for distributed hypertext systems. Our model supportsauthorizations at different granularity levels; takes into consideration different types of dataand the relationships among them; and allows administrative privileges to be delegated.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data engineering,1996,118
Fine grained access control for SOAP E-services,Ernesto Damiani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,ABSTRACT Lightweight protocols for remote service invocation via HTTP and XML; such asSOAP; are rapidly gaining acceptance among developers of Internet-based e-services;especially because of their firewall-traversal capabilities. However; no standard techniquefor access control security is currently defined for either HTTP or SOAP itself. Concerns havebeen raised about the possibility that different SOAP applications will deal with embeddedsecurity in different ways; leading to application-dependent security holes. In this paper; wepropose an approach that relies on the XML structure of SOAP requests to support fine-grained authorizations at the level of individual XML elements and attributes that compose aSOAP call.

Information flow control in object-oriented systems,Pierangela Samarati; Elisa Bertino; Alessandro Ciampichetti; Sushil Jajodia,We describe a high assurance discretionary access control model for object orientedsystems. The model not only ensures protection against Trojan horses leaking information;but provides the flexibility of discretionary access control at the same time. The basic idea ofour approach is to check all information flows among objects in the system in order to blockpossible illegal flows. An illegal flow arises when information is transmitted from one objectto another object in violation of the security policy. The interaction modes among objects aretaken into account in determining illegal flows. We consider three different interaction modesthat are standard interaction modes found in the open distributed processing models. Thepaper presents formal definitions and proof of correctness of our flow control algorithm.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1997,109

Key management for multi-user encrypted databases,Ernesto Damiani; S De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Database outsourcing is becoming increasingly popular introducing a newparadigm; called database-as-a-service (DAS); where an organization's database is storedat an external service provider. In such a scenario; access control is a very important issue;especially if the data owner wishes to publish her data for external use. In this paper; we firstpresent our approach for the implementation of access control through selective encryption.The focus of the paper is then the presentation of the experimental results; whichdemonstrate the applicability of our proposal.,Proceedings of the 2005 ACM workshop on Storage security and survivability,2005,107
An Open Digest-based Technique for Spam Detection.,Ernesto Damiani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract A promising anti-spam technique consists in collecting users opinions that givenemail messages are spam and using this collective judgment to block message propagationto other users. To be effective; this strategy requires a way to identify similarity among emailmessages; even if the program used by the spammer to generate the messages may try toobfuscate their common origin. In this paper; we investigate the issues arising in the designof a digest-based spam detection mechanism; which has to satisfy many conflictingrequirements: protect message confidentiality; be public; and prove difficult or expensive tofool by obfuscation techniques that automatically introduce differences into the same basespam message. We show that an open digest function is able to satisfy the aboverequirements and contribute to the fight against spam.,ISCA PDCS,2004,105
Keep a few: Outsourcing data while maintaining confidentiality,Valentina Ciriani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract We put forward a novel paradigm for preserving privacy in data outsourcing whichdeparts from encryption. The basic idea behind our proposal is to involve the owner instoring a limited portion of the data; and maintaining all data (either at the owner or atexternal servers) in the clear. We assume a relational context; where the data to beoutsourced is contained in a relational table. We then analyze how the relational table canbe fragmented; minimizing the load for the data owner. We propose several metrics andpresent a general framework capturing all of them; with a corresponding algorithm finding aheuristic solution to a family of NP-hard problems.,*,2009,104
Efficient and private access to outsourced data,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Gerardo Pelosi; Pierangela Samarati,As the use of external storage and data processing services for storing and managingsensitive data becomes more and more common; there is an increasing need for noveltechniques that support not only data confidentiality; but also confidentiality of the accessesthat users make on such data. In this paper; we propose a technique for guaranteeingcontent; access; and pattern confidentiality in the data outsourcing scenario. The proposedtechnique introduces a shuffle index structure; which adapts traditional B+-trees. We showthat our solution exhibits a limited performance cost; thus resulting effectively usable inpractice.,Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS); 2011 31st International Conference on,2011,100
Managing multiple and dependable identities,Ernesto Damiani; S De Capitani Di Vimercati; Pierangela Samarati,Digital management of multiple robust identities is a crucial issue in developing the nextgeneration of distributed applications. Our daily activities increasingly rely on remoteresources and services-specifically; on interactions between different; remotely locatedparties. Because these parties might (and sometimes should) know little about each other;digital identities-electronic representations of individuals' or organizations' sensitiveinformation-help introduce them to each other and control the amount of informationtransferred. In its broadest sense; identity management encompasses definitions and life-cycle management for digital identities and profiles; as well as environments for exchangingand validating such information. Digital identity management-especially support for identitydependability and multiplicity-is crucial for building and maintaining trust relationships in …,IEEE Internet Computing,2003,99
Access control: principles and solutions,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Access control is the process of mediating every request to resources and datamaintained by a system and determining whether the request should be granted or denied.The variety and complexity of the protection requirements that may need to be imposedmakes access control a far from trivial process. Expressiveness and flexibility are toprequisites for an access control system together with; and usually in conflict with; simplicityand efficiency. In this paper; we discuss the main desiderata for access control systems andillustrate the main characteristics of access control solutions in some of the most popularexisting systems.

Providing flexibility in information flow control for object oriented systems,Elena Ferrari; Pierangela Samarati; Elisa Bertino; Sushil Jajodia,This paper presents an approach to control information flow in object-oriented systems thattakes into account; besides authorizations on objects; also how the information has beenobtained and/or transmitted. These aspects are considered by allowing exceptions to therestrictions stated by the authorizations. Exceptions are specified by means of waiversassociated with methods. Two kinds of waivers are supported: invoke-waivers; specifyingexceptions applicable during a method's execution; and reply-waivers; specifyingexceptions applicable to the information returned by a method. Information flowing from oneobject into another object is subject to the different waivers of the methods enforcing thetransmission. We formally characterize information transmission and flow in a transactiontaking into consideration different interaction modes among objects. We then define …,Security and Privacy; 1997.

Fragmentation and encryption to enforce privacy in data storage,Valentina Ciriani; Sabrina De Capitani Di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Privacy requirements have an increasing impact on the realization of modernapplications. Technical considerations and many significant commercial and legalregulations demand today that privacy guarantees be provided whenever sensitiveinformation is stored; processed; or communicated to external parties. It is therefore crucialto design solutions able to respond to this demand with a clear integration strategy forexisting applications and a consideration of the performance impact of the protectionmeasures. In this paper we address this problem and propose a solution to enforce privacyover data collections by combining data fragmentation with encryption.

New paradigms for access control in open environments,Ernesto Damiani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Pierangela Samarati,Many access control models and policies have been proposed in recent years for differentpurposes. Access control is now evolving with the complex environments that it support. Inopen environments such as the Internet; the decision to grant access to a resource is oftenbased on the characteristics of the requestor rather than its identity. Also; people have oftenlittle control over their personal information once it has been disclosed to third parties.Privacy and secondary usage regulations are increasingly demanding attention. In thispaper; we present the emerging trends in the access control field to address the new needsand desiderata of today's systems,Signal Processing and Information Technology; 2005.

Database security: research and practice,Elisa Bertino; Sushil Jajodia; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract As an increasing number of organizations become dependent on access to theirdata over the Internet; the need for adequate security measures is becoming more and morecritical. The most popular security measure these days is a firewall. However; a firewall is notimmune to penetration; and it does not provide any protection of internal resources frominsiders and successful intruders. One of the requirements for the protection of internalresources is access control to ensure that all accesses are authorized according to somespecified policy. In this paper; we survey the state of the art in access control for databasesystems; discuss the main research issues; and outline possible directions for futureresearch.,*,1995,84
A classification of update methods for replicated databases,Stefano Ceri; Maurice Houtsma; Arthur Keller; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract In this paper we present a classi cation of the methods for updating replicateddatabases. The main contribution of this paper is to present the various methods in thecontext of a structured taxonomy; which accommodates very heterogeneous methods.Classes of update methods are presented through their general properties; such as theinvariants that hold for them. Methods are reviewed both in their normal and abnormalbehaviour (ie; after a network partition). We show that several methods presented in theliterature; sometimes in independent papers with no crossreference; are indeed very muchrelated; for instance because they share the same basic technique. We also show in whatsense they diverge from the basic technique. This classi cation can serve as a basis forchoosing the method that is most suitable to a speci c application.

Authorizations in relational database management systems,Elisa Bertino; Pierangela Samarati; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract This paper proposes two major extensions to the authorization model for System Rrelational database management system. The first extension concerns the revoke operation.The revised model provides for a new type of revoke operation; called noncascading revoke;in addition to the System R cascading revoke operation. Unlike cascading revoke;noncascading revoke operation does not recursively remove privileges from users. Thesecond extension concerns negative authorization.

Exploiting cryptography for privacy-enhanced access control: A result of the PRIME project,Claudio A Ardagna; Jan Camenisch; Markulf Kohlweiss; Ronald Leenes; Gregory Neven; Bart Priem; Pierangela Samarati; Dieter Sommer; Mario Verdicchio,Abstract We conduct more and more of our daily interactions over electronic media. The EC-funded project PRIME (Privacy and Identity Management for Europe) envisions thatindividuals will be able to interact in this information society in a secure and safe way whileretaining control of their privacy. The project had set out to prove that existing privacy-enhancing technologies allow for the construction of a user-controlled identity managementsystem that comes surprisingly close to this vision. This paper describes two key elements ofthe PRIME identity management systems: anonymous credentials and policy languages thatfully exploit the advanced functionality offered by anonymous credentials. These two keyelements enable the users to carry out transactions; eg; over the Internet; revealing only thestrictly necessary personal information.

Authorization specification and enforcement in federated database systems,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract A federated system is a collection of cooperating autonomous databases.Federated systems represent today one of the new emerging technologies for datamanagement. This success comes from the need to integrate and work on different existingsystems that have been developed and have evolved independently. The necessity ofmaking them available to users as if they were a single system; while at the same time notaffecting their independent working; arises several issues with respect to authorizationmanagement and specification and to access control enforcement.

A temporal authorization model,Elisa Bertino; Claudio Bettini; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract This paper presents a discretionary access control model in which authorizationscontain temporal information. This information can be used to specify temporal intervals ofvalidity for authorizations and temporal dependencies among authorizations. A formaldefinition of those concepts is presented in the paper; in terms of their interpretation in firstorder logic. We characterize sets of temporal dependencies that can lead to undesirablestates of the authorization system and we sketch an algorithm for their detection. Finally;operations to add; remove; or modify authorizations and temporal dependencies aredescribed.,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security,1994,69

Securing SOAP e-services,E Damiani; S De Capitani di Vimercati; S Paraboschi; P Samarati,Abstract. Remote service invocation via HTTP and XML promises to become an importantcomponent of the Internet infrastructure. Work is ongoing in the W3C XML Protocol WorkingGroup to define a common standard; and solutions like SOAP and XML-RPC are alreadyused in a few situations; demonstrating the potential. However; no standard technique foraccess control security is currently defined for these protocols. In this paper; we propose anapproach that relies on the XML structure of SOAP requests to support fine-grainedauthorizations at the level of individual XML elements and attributes that comprise a SOAPcall.

Lattice-based security classification system and method,*,Despite advances in recent years in the area of mandatory access control in databasesystems; today's information repositories remain vulnerable to inference and dataassociation attacks that can result in serious information leakage. Without support for copingagainst these attacks; sensitive information can be put at risk because of release of other(less sensitive) related information. The ability to protect information disclosure against suchimproper leakage would be of great benefit to governmental; public; and private institutions;which are; today more than ever; required to make portions of their data available forexternal release.

Preserving confidentiality of security policies in data outsourcing,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Gerardo Pelosi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Recent approaches for protecting information in data outsourcing scenarios exploitthe combined use of access control and cryptography. In this context; the number of keys tobe distributed and managed by users can be maintained limited by using a public catalog oftokens that allow key derivation along a hierarchy. However; the public token catalog; byexpressing the key derivation relationships; may leak information on the security policies(authorizations) enforced by the system; which the data owner may instead wish to maintainconfidential. In this paper; we present an approach to protect the privacy of the tokenspublished in the public catalog. Consistently with the data outsourcing scenario; our solutionexploits the use of cryptography; by adding an encryption layer to the catalog.

Access control for smarter healthcare using policy spaces,Claudio A Ardagna; Sabrina De Capitani Di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Tyrone W Grandison; Sushil Jajodia; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract A fundamental requirement for the healthcare industry is that the delivery of carecomes first and nothing should interfere with it. As a consequence; the access controlmechanisms used in healthcare to regulate and restrict the disclosure of data are oftenbypassed in case of emergencies. This phenomenon; called “break the glass”; is a commonpattern in healthcare organizations and; though quite useful and mandatory in emergencysituations; from a security perspective; it represents a serious system weakness. Malicioususers; in fact; can abuse the system by exploiting the break the glass principle to gainunauthorized privileges and accesses.

The success of this technology; which has been receiving increasingatten-tion from researchers and developers; comes from the need to integrate and work ondiflerent existing systems indepen-dently developed and evolved. The necessity of makingthem atlailable to users as if they were a single system while at the same time not affectingtheir independent working arises several issues with respect to authorization managementand specification and to access control enforcement.

Severalapproaches have been presented to database outsourcing management; investigating theapplication of data encryption together with indexing information to allow the execution ofqueries at the third party; without the need of decrypting the data. These proposals assumeaccess control to be under the control of the data owner; who has to filter all the accessrequests to data.

Weinvestigate and formulate different requirements that users or service providers may wish tospecify. Our framework allows providers to impose restrictions on the allocations to be madeto their hosts and users to express constraints on the placement of their virtual machines(VMs). User's placement constraints may impose restrictions in performing allocation tospecific locations; within certain boundaries; or depending on some conditions (eg; requiringa VM to be allocated to a different host wrt other VMs). Our approach for VM allocation goesbeyond the classical (performance/cost-oriented) resource consumption to incorporate thesecurity requirements specified by users and providers.,Computational Science and Engineering (CSE); 2012 IEEE 15th International Conference on,2012,54
Encryption-based policy enforcement for cloud storage,S De Capitani Di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Gerardo Pelosi; Pierangela Samarati,Nowadays; users are more and more exploiting external storage and connectivity for sharingand disseminating user-generated content. To this aim; they can benefit of the servicesoffered by Internet companies; which however assume that the service provider is entitled toaccess the resources. To overcome this limitation; we present an approach that does notrequire complete trust in the external service wrt both resource content and authorizationmanagement; while at the same time allowing users to delegate to the provider theenforcement of the access control policy on their resources. Our solution relies on thetranslation of the access control policy into an equivalent encryption policy on resources andon a hierarchical key structure that limits both the number of keys to be maintained and theamount of encryption to be enforced.,Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW); 2010 IEEE 30th International Conference on,2010,53

We address this privacy/efficiency balance proposing an approach that;starting from a flexible definition of confidentiality constraints on a relational schema; appliesencryption on information in a parsimonious way and mostly relies on fragmentation toprotect sensitive associations among attributes.

High assurance discretionary access control for object bases,Elisa Bertino; Pierangela Samarati; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract Discretionary access control; based on checking access requests against users'authorizations; does not provide any way of restricting the usage of information once it hasbeen “legally” accessed. This makes discretionary systems vulnerable to Trojan Horsesmaliciously leaking information. Therefore the need arises for providing additional controlslimiting the indiscriminate flow of information in the system. This paper proposes a messagefilter complementing discretionary authorization control in object-oriented systems to limit thevulnerability of authorization systems to Trojan Horses.

Visibility requirements express requests for viewsover data that should be provided. We propose a solution based on data fragmentation tosplit sensitive associations while ensuring visibility. In addition; we show how sensitiveassociations broken by fragmentation can be released in a sanitized form as looseassociations formed in a way to guarantee a specified degree of privacy.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,43
Minimal data upgrading to prevent inference and association attacks,Steven Dawson; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Patrick Lincoln; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Despite advances in recent years in the area of mandatory access control indatabase systems; today's information repositories remain vulnerable to inference and dataassociation attacks that can result in serious information leakage. Such information leakagecan be prevented by properly classifying information according to constraints that expressrelationships among the security levels of data objects. In this paper we address the problemof classifying information by enforcing explicit data classification as well as inference andassociation constraints. We formulate the problem of determining a classification thatensures satisfaction of the constraints; while at the same time guaranteeing that informationwill not be unnecessarily overclassified. We present an approach to the s; olution of thisproblem and give an algorithm implementing it which is linear in simple cases; and low …,Proceedings of the eighteenth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems,1999,43
A component-based architecture for secure data publication,Piero A Bonatti; Ernesto Damiani; S De Capitani di Vimercati; Pierangela Samarati,We present an approach for controlling access to data publishers in the framework of Web-based information services. The paper presents a model for enforcing access controlregulations; an XML core schema and namespace for expressing such regulations; andillustrates the architecture of the Access Control Unit (ACU); an autonomous softwarecomponent based on the proposed model. Besides" standard" authorizations; the ACUsupports authorizations based on user profiles and dynamic conditions whose outcome isdetermined by user actions such as the acceptance of a written agreement and/or payment.,Proceedings of the 17th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference; 2001.

Specification and enforcement of classification and inference constraints,Steven Dawson; S De Capitani di Vimercati; Pierangela Samarati,Although mandatory access control in database systems has been extensively studied inrecent years; and several models and systems have been proposed; capabilities forenforcement of mandatory constraints remain limited. Lack of support for expressing andcombating inference channels that improperly leak protected information remains a majorlimitation in today's multilevel systems. Moreover the working assumption that data areclassified at insertion time makes previous approaches inapplicable to the classification ofexisting; possibly historical; data repositories that need to be classified for release. Such acapability would be of great benefit to; and appears to be in demand by; governmental;public and private institutions.

Independent updates and incremental agreement in replicated databases,Stefano Ceri; Maurice AW Houtsma; Arthur M Keller; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Update propagation and transaction atomicity are major obstacles to thedevelopment of replicated databases. Many practical applications; such as automated tellermachine networks; flight reservation; and part inventory control; do not require theseproperties. In this paper we present an approach for incrementally updating a distributed;replicated database without requiring multi-site atomic commit protocols. We prove that themechanism is correct; as it asymptotically performs all the updates on all the copies. Ourapproach has two important characteristics: it is progressive; and non-blocking. Progressivemeans that the transaction's coordinator always commits; possibly together with a group ofother sites. The update is later propagated asynchronously to the remaining sites. Non-blocking means that each site can take unilateral decisions at each step of the algorithm …,Distributed and Parallel Databases,1995,40
Enabling privacy-preserving credential-based access control with XACML and SAML,Claudio A Ardagna; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Gregory Neven; Stefano Paraboschi; Franz-Stefan Preiss; Pierangela Samarati; Mario Verdicchio,In this paper we describe extensions to the access control industry standards XACML andSAML to enable privacy-preserving and credential-based access control. Rather thanassuming that an enforcement point knows all the requester's attributes; our extensionsallow the requester to learn which attributes have to be revealed and which conditions mustbe satisfied; thereby enabling to leverage the advantages of privacy-preservingtechnologies such as anonymous credentials. Moreover; our extensions follow a credential-based approach; ie; attributes are regarded as being bundled together in credentials; andthe policy can refer to attributes within specific credentials. In addition to defining languageextensions; we also show how the XACML architecture and model of evaluating policies canbe adapted to the credential-based setting; and we discuss the problems that such …,Computer and Information Technology (CIT); 2010 IEEE 10th International Conference on,2010,39
An experimental evaluation of multi-key strategies for data outsourcing,E Damiani; S De Capitani di Vimercati; S Foresti; S Jajodia; S Paraboschi; P Samarati,Abstract Data outsourcing is emerging today as a successful solution for organizationslooking for a cost-effective way to make their data available for on-line querying. To protectoutsourced data from unauthorized accesses; even from the (honest but curious) hostserver; data are encrypted and indexes associated with them enable the server to executequeries without the need of accessing cleartext. Current solutions consider the wholedatabase as encrypted with a single key known only to the data owner; which therefore hasto be kept involved in the query execution process. In this paper; we propose different multi-key data encryption strategies for enforcing access privileges. Our strategies exploit differentkeys; which are distributed to the users; corresponding to the different authorizations. Wethen present some experiments evaluating the quality of the proposed strategies with …,New Approaches for Security; Privacy and Trust in Complex Environments,2007,39
A WOWA-based aggregation technique on trust values connected to metadata,Ernesto Damiani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Pierangela Samarati; Marco Viviani,Abstract Metadata produced by members of a diverse community of peers tend to containlow-quality or even mutually inconsistent assertions. Trust values computed on the basis ofusers' feedback can improve metadata quality and reduce inconsistency; eliminatinguntrustworthy assertions. In this paper; we describe an approach to metadata creation andimprovement; where community members express their opinions on the trustworthiness ofeach assertion. Our technique aggregates individual trustworthiness values to obtain acommunity-wide assessment of each assertion. We then apply a global trustworthinessthreshold to eliminate some assertions to reduce the metadatabase's overall inconsistency.,Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science,2006,39
Efficient key management for enforcing access control in outsourced scenarios,Carlo Blundo; Stelvio Cimato; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Alfredo De Santis; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Data outsourcing is emerging today as a successful paradigm allowing individualsand organizations to exploit external servers for storing and distributing data. While trustedto properly manage the data; external servers are often not authorized to read them;therefore requiring data to be encrypted. In such a context; the application of an accesscontrol policy requires different data to be encrypted with different keys so to allow theexternal server to directly enforce access control and support selective dissemination andaccess. The problem therefore emerges of designing solutions for the efficient managementof the encryption policy enforcing access control; with the goal of minimizing the number ofkeys to be maintained by the system and distributed to users. Since such a problem is NP-hard; we propose a heuristic approach to its solution based on a key derivation graph …,*,2009,38
Access control policies and languages in open environments,S De Capitani di Vimercati; S Foresti; S Jajodia; P Samarati,Abstract Access control is the process of mediating every request to resources and datamaintained by a system and determining whether the request should be granted or denied.Access control plays an important role in overall system security. The development of anaccess control system requires the definition of the regulations (policies) according to whichaccess is to be controlled and their implementation as functions executable by a computersystem. The access control policies are usually formalized through a security model; statedthrough an appropriate specification language; and then enforced by the access controlmechanism enforcing the access control service. The separation between policies andmechanisms introduces an independence between protection requirements to be enforcedon the one side; and mechanisms enforcing them on the other. It is then possible to: i) …,Secure data management in decentralized systems,2007,36
Maximizing sharing of protected information,Steven Dawson; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Patrick Lincoln; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Despite advances in recent years in the area of mandatory access control indatabase systems; today's information repositories remain vulnerable to inference and dataassociation attacks that can result in serious information leakage. Without support for copingagainst these attacks; sensitive information can be put at risk because of release of other(less sensitive) related information. The ability to protect information diclosure against suchimproper leakage would be of great benefit to governmental; public; and private institutions;which are; today more than ever; required to make portions of their data available forexternal release.

With its significant benefits of scalability and elasticity;the cloud paradigm has appealed to companies as well as individuals; which areincreasingly resorting to the clouds to store and process data.

Data privacy: definitions and techniques,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Giovanni Livraga; Pierangela Samarati,The proper protection of data privacy is a complex task that requires a careful analysis ofwhat actually has to be kept private. Several definitions of privacy have been proposed overthe years; from traditional syntactic privacy definitions; which capture the protection degreeenjoyed by data respondents with a numerical value; to more recent semantic privacydefinitions; which take into consideration the mechanism chosen for releasing the data. Inthis paper; we illustrate the evolution of the definitions of privacy; and we survey some dataprotection techniques devised for enforcing such definitions. We also illustrate some well-known application scenarios in which the discussed data protection techniques have beensuccessfully used; and present some open issues.,International journal of uncertainty; fuzziness and knowledge-based systems,2012,34
Access controls in object-oriented database systems—Some approaches and issues,Elisa Bertino; Sushil Jajodia; Pierangela Samarati,Object-oriented database management systems (OODBMSs) today represent one of themost active areas in both academic and industrial worlds. OODBMSs combine object-oriented programming technology with database technology; thus combining the strengthsof both. The need for these systems has been driven by several advanced applications; suchas CAD/CAM; cartography; multimedia; for which relational systems have been provedinadequate. A serious problem with these systems is that they do not provide adequateaccess control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information. They do notprovide for the mandatory security [146] and; in most cases; do not even provide adequatediscretionary authorization facilities (a notable exception is presented by the ORION/ITASCAsystem [460]). We can expect; however; that the broadening of application scope of these …,*,1993,33
Integrity for join queries in the cloud,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,We address the problem of providing users with the ability to assess the integrity of joinresults produced by external computational providers and computed over externally storeddatabases. Our approach relies on different mutually supporting techniques offering strongintegrity protection guarantees at a limited cost. The application of the approach iscompletely transparent to the computational provider; against which data and queryconfidentiality are preserved. The paper introduces our techniques analytically; examiningtheir protection guarantees and performance. It also illustrates experimental results; whichconfirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our solutions.,IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing,2013,32
Controlled information sharing in collaborative distributed query processing,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,We present a simple; yet powerful; approach for the specification and enforcement ofauthorizations regulating data release among data holders collaborating in a distributedcomputation; to ensure that query processing discloses only data whose release has beenexplicitly authorized. Data disclosure is captured by means of profiles; associated with eachdata computation; that describe the information carried by the result. We also present analgorithm that; given a query plan; determines whether it can be safely executed andproduces a safe execution strategy. The main advantage of our approach is its simplicitythat; without impacting expressiveness; makes it nicely interoperable with current solutionsfor collaborative computations in distributed database systems.,Distributed Computing Systems; 2008.

A promising approach is represented by credential-based access control and trust management. However; although much research has beendone and several proposals exist; a clear obstacle to the realization of their benefits in data-intensive Web applications is represented by the lack of adequate support in the DBMSs. Asa matter of fact; DBMSs are often responsible for the management of most of the informationthat is accessed using a Web browser or a Web service invocation. In this article; we aim ateliminating this gap; and present an approach integrating trust management with the accesscontrol of the DBMS.

Selective data outsourcing for enforcing privacy,Valentina Ciriani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Existing approaches for protecting sensitive information outsourced at external“honest-but-curious” servers are typically based on an overlying layer of encryption appliedto the whole database; or on the combined use of fragmentation and encryption. In thispaper; we put forward a novel paradigm for preserving privacy in data outsourcing; whichdeparts from encryption. The basic idea is to involve the owner in storing a limited portion ofthe data; while storing the remaining information in the clear at the external server. Weanalyze the problem of computing a fragmentation that minimizes the owner's workload;which is represented using different metrics and corresponding weight functions; and provethat this minimization problem is NP-hard.

On the one side; precise location information may play an importantrole and can be used to develop Location-based Access Control (LBAC) systems thatintegrate traditional access control mechanisms with conditions based on the physicalposition of users. On the other side; location information of users can be consideredsensitive and access control solutions should be developed to protect it againstunauthorized accesses and disclosures.

Enforcing dynamic write privileges in data outsourcing,Sabrina De Capitani Di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Giovanni Livraga; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Users and companies are more and more resorting to external providers for storingtheir data and making them available to others. Since data sharing is typically selective (ie;accesses to certain data should be allowed only to authorized users); there is the problem ofenforcing authorizations on the outsourced data. Recently proposed approaches based onselective encryption provide convenient enforcement of read privileges; but are not directlyapplicable for supporting write privileges. In this paper; we extend selective encryptionapproaches to the support of write privileges. Our proposal enriches the approach based onkey derivation of existing solutions and complements it with a hash-based approach forsupporting write privileges. Enforcement of write privileges and of possible policy updatesrelies on the–controlled–cooperation of the external provider. Our solution also allows the …,Computers & Security,2013,29

The main reason of this success is the anonymity the users enjoy.However; as recent experiences with P2P networks show; this anonymity offers anopportunity to exploit the network for abuses (eg; the spread of malware).

Maintaining replicated authorizations in distributed database systems,Pierangela Samarati; Paul Ammann; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract We consider the propagation of authorizations in distributed database systems. Wepresent an optimistic replica control algorithm that ensures that the authorization table at anygiven site evolves consistently with respect to other sites. The motivation for using optimisticreplica control to maintain authorizations is that site and communication failures do notneedlessly delay authorization changes. In addition; the semantics of the authorizationoperations we employ can be exploited to resolve transient inconsistencies without theexpense of an undo-redo mechanism. Instead; we give efficient; direct algorithms whereby asite scans its log of authorization requests and updates its authorization tablecorrespondingly. From the system perspective; any inconsistencies in the authorization tablereplicas maintained at different sites are transient and are eliminated by further …,Data & knowledge engineering,1996,29
Enforcing confidentiality constraints on sensitive databases with lightweight trusted clients,Valentina Ciriani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Existing approaches for protecting sensitive information stored (outsourced) atexternal “honest-but-curious” servers are typically based on an overlying layer of encryptionthat is applied on the whole information; or use a combination of fragmentation andencryption. The computational load imposed by encryption makes such approaches notsuitable for scenarios with lightweight clients. In this paper; we address this issue andpropose a novel model for enforcing privacy requirements on the outsourced informationwhich departs from encryption. The basic idea of our approach is to store a small portion ofthe data (just enough to break sensitive associations) on the client; which is trusted beingunder the data owner control; while storing the remaining information in clear form at theexternal (honest-but-curious) server.

Towards privacy-enhanced authorization policies and languages,Claudio Agostino Ardagna; Ernesto Damiani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract The protection of privacy in today's global infrastructure requires the combinedapplication solution from technology (technical measures); legislation (law and publicpolicy); and organizational and individual policies and practices. Emerging scenarios of user-service interactions in the digital world are also pushing toward the development of powerfuland flexible privacy-enhanced models and languages. This paper aims at introducingconcepts and features that should be investigated to fulfill this demand. In particular; thecontent of this paper is a result of our ongoing activity in the framework of the PRIME project(Privacy and Identity Management for Europe); funded by the European Commission; whoseobjective is the development of privacy-aware solutions for enforcing security.,*,2005,28

Private data indexes for selective access to outsourced data,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Cloud storage services have recently emerged as a successful approach formaking resources conveniently available to large communities of users. Several techniqueshave been investigated for enabling such services; including encryption for ensuring dataprotection; as well as indexing for enabling efficient query execution on encrypted data.When data are to be made available selectively; the combined use of the two techniquesmust be handled with care; since indexes can put the confidentiality protection guaranteedby encryption at risk. In this paper; we investigate this issue and propose an indexingtechnique for supporting efficient access to encrypted data while preventing possibledisclosure of data to users not authorized to access them. Intuitively; our indexing techniqueaccounts for authorizations when producing indexes so to ensure that different …,Proceedings of the 10th annual ACM workshop on Privacy in the electronic society,2011,27
Enhancing user privacy through data handling policies,Claudio Agostino Ardagna; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract The protection of privacy is an increasing concern in today's global infrastructure.One of the most important privacy protection principles states that personal informationcollected for one purpose may not be used for any other purpose without the specificinformed consent of the person it concerns. Although users provide personal information foruse in one specific context; they often have no idea on how such a personal information maybe used subsequently. In this paper; we introduce a new type of privacy policy; called datahandling policy; which defines how the personal information release will be (or should be)dealt with at the receiving party. A data handling policy allows users to define simple andappropriate levels of control over who sees what information about them and under whichcircumstances.,*,2006,27
An authorization model for a public key management service,Pierangela Samarati; Michael K Reiter; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract Public key management has received considerable attention from both the researchand commercial communities as a useful primitive for secure electronic commerce andsecure communication. While the mechanics of certifying and revoking public keys andescrowing and recovering private keys have been widely explored; less attention has beenpaid to access control frameworks for regulating access to stored keys by different parties. Inthis article we propose such a framework for a key management service that supports publickey registration; lookup; and revocation; and private key escrow; protected use (eg; todecrypt selected messages); and recovery. We propose an access control model using apolicy based on principal; ownership; and authority relationships on keys.

Recent proposals forspecifying and exchanging access control policies adopt XML-based languages. XMLappears in fact a natural choice as the basis for the common security-policy language; dueto the ease with which its syntax and semantics can be extended and the widespreadsupport that it enjoys from all the main platform and tool vendors.

Fragmentation in presence of data dependencies,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Giovanni Livraga; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Fragmentation has been recently proposed as a promising approach to protect theconfidentiality of sensitive associations whenever data need to undergo external release orstorage. By splitting attributes among different fragments; fragmentation guaranteesconfidentiality of the associations among these attributes under the assumption that suchassociations cannot be reconstructed by re-combining the fragments. We note that therequirement that fragments do not have attributes in common; imposed by previousproposals; is only a necessary; but not sufficient; condition to ensure that information indifferent fragments cannot be recombined as dependencies may exist among data enablingsome form of linkability.

A majorproblem in this context is that the privacy of users is increasingly at risk; calling for solutionsbalancing the benefits provided by LBSs and the privacy guarantees. In this paper; we studya novel privacy problem related to inferences of sensitive information caused by the releaseof consecutive positions to LBS providers. We provide an approach based on Markov chainsthat allows the user to continuously release her location information in a privacy-preservingway. We then define an approach to counteract different inference channels; addressingusers' preferences in terms of both privacy requirements and quality of service.,Computational Science and Engineering (CSE); 2012 IEEE 15th International Conference on,2012,24
Assessing query privileges via safe and efficient permission composition,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract We propose an approach for the selective enforcement of access control restrictionsin; possibly distributed; large data collections based on two basic concepts: i) flexibleauthorizations identify; in a declarative way; the data that can be released; and ii) queriesare checked for execution not with respect to individual authorizations but rather evaluatingwhether the information release they (directly or indirectly) entail is allowed by theauthorizations. Our solution is based on the definition of query profiles capturing theinformation content of a query and builds on a graph-based modeling of database schema;authorizations; and queries. Access control is then effectively modeled and efficientlyexecuted in terms of graph coloring and composition and on traversal of graph paths. Wethen provide a polynomial composition algorithm for determining if a query is authorized.,Proceedings of the 15th ACM conference on Computer and communications security,2008,24

Since the manyopportunities for better interacting services and the provision of richer functionality; crossingthe boundary of organizations many standard proposals addressing different aspects ofsuch interaction model are appearing. In this paper; we analyze the security requirements ofthe WSA and observe that the security model currently developed is not sufficient. Inparticular; we claim that many aspects related to network security and the integration offirewalls into the WSA have been understimated. We show with different examples theusefulness of a semantics-aware firewall operating both at SOAP level and at lower network-based layers.

In current mobile systems; users gain access to remote servers over mobilenetwork operators. These operators are typically assumed to be trusted and to manage theinformation they collect in a privacy-preserving way. Such information; however; is extremelysensitive and coveted by many companies; which may use it to improve their business. Inthis context; safeguarding the users' privacy against the prying eyes of the network operatorsis an emerging requirement.

Moreover; we illustrate recent and ongoing research that attempts toaddress different aspects of privacy in mobile applications. Furthermore; we present a …,*,2009,23
Regulating exceptions in healthcare using policy spaces,Claudio Agostino Ardagna; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Tyrone Grandison; Sushil Jajodia; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract One truth holds for the healthcare industry-nothing should interfere with the deliveryof care. Given this fact; the access control mechanisms used in healthcare to regulate andrestrict the disclosure of data are often bypassed. This “break the glass” phenomenon is anestablished pattern in healthcare organizations and; though quite useful and mandatory inemergency situations; it represents a serious system weakness. In this paper; we proposean access control solution aimed at a better management of exceptions that occur inhealthcare. Our solution is based on the definition of different policy spaces regulatingaccess to patient data and used to balance the rigorous nature of traditional access controlsystems with the prioritization of care delivery.,*,2008,23
Authentication; Access Controls; and Intrusion Detection,Ravi S Sandhu; Pierangela Samarati,An important requirement of any information management system is to protect informationagainst improper disclosure or modi cation (known as con dentiality and integrityrespectively). Three mutually supportive technologies are used to achieve this goal.Authentication; access control and audit together provide the foundation for information andsystem security as follows. Authentication establishes the identity of one party to another.Most commonly authentication establishes the identity of a user to some part of the systemtypically by means of a password. More generally; authentication can be computer-to-computer or process-to-process and mutual in both directions. Access control determineswhat one party will allow another to do with respect to resources and objects mediated bythe former. Access control usually requires authentication as a prerequisite.

Supporting periodic authorizations and temporal reasoning in database access control,Elisa Bertino; Claudio Bettini; Elena Ferrari; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Several formal models for database access control have been proposed. However;little attention has been paid to temporal issues like authorizations with limited validity orobtained by deductive reasoning with temporal constraints. We present an access controlmodel in which authorizations contain periodic temporal intervals of validity. Anauthorization is automatically granted in the time intervals speci ed by a periodic expressionand revoked when such intervals expire. Deductive temporal rules with periodicity and orderconstraints are provided to derive new authorizations based on the presence or absence ofother authorizations in speci c periods of time. We prove the uniqueness of the set of implicitauthorizations derivable at a given instant from the explicit ones; and we propose analgorithm to compute the global set of valid authorizations.

Huge datacollections can be analyzed by powerful techniques (eg; data mining techniques [12]) andsophisticated algorithms thus making possible linking attacks combining informationavailable through different sources to infer information that was not intended for disclosure.For instance; by linking de-identified medical records (ie; records where the explicitidentifiers such as the Social Security Numbers have been removed) with other publiclyavailable data or by looking at unique characteristics found in the released medical data …,Algorithms and theory of computation handbook,2009,21

Protecting information on the Web,Elisa Bertino; Elena Pagani; Gian Paolo Rossi; Pierangela Samarati,Data access protection is generally governed by rules establishing accesses to be allowedor denied. The definition of these rules; which generally take the form of authorizations;requires the establishment of subjects to which access can be granted/denied; objects towhich access can be granted/denied; and actions for which access can be granted/denied.Each data-access request is checked against specified authorizations and granted only ifauthorized. To ensure that authorizations are correctly evaluated; the identity of the subjectrequesting access must be verified. Each access request must be accompanied by adeclaration and a proof of identity. The most common forms of identification and identityproofs are the login and password that users enter to sign into the system. In the remainderof this article; we illustrate some issues regarding data access protection on the Web [4] …,Communications of the ACM,2000,21
Research issues in discretionary authorizations for object bases,Elisa Bertino; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract The conventional models of authorizations have been designed for databasesystems supporting the hierarchical; network; and relational models of data.

An access control model for querying XML data,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Stefania Marrara; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract In the last few years; an increasing amount of si-structured data have becomeavailable electronically to humans and programs. In such a context; XML is rapidly erging asthe new standard for si-structured data representation and exchange on the Internet.Securing XML data is then becoming increasingly important and several attpts at developingmethods for securing XML data have been proposed. However; these proposals do not takeinto consideration scenarios where users want to query XML data by using complex querylanguage. In this paper; we propose an extension to our previous access control modelhandling the new standard query language XQuery; which is a powerful and convenientlanguage designed for querying XML data.,Proceedings of the 2005 workshop on Secure web services,2005,20
Secure Interoperation of Heterogeneous Systems:-A Mediator-Based Approach,S Dawson; S Qian; P Samarati,Abstract This paper addresses the problem of ensuring protection in the interoperation ofheterogeneous data sources. We present a system that allows data sources enforcingmandatory multilevel policies to interoperate and make their data available to externalapplications still maintaining autonomy and security. Sources can be heterogenous withrespect to both the data model and the security lattices governing access control. Ourapproach is based on the use of wrappers and a mediator. A wrapper associated with eachsource provides a uniform data interface and mapping between the source's lattice andother lattices. The mediator processes global access requests by interfacing applicationsand data sources. We show how the relationships between the security lattices are statedand controlled for inconsistencies; and how global queries are processed by the mediator …,*,1998,20
Authorization and access control,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Access control is the process of controlling every request to a system anddetermining; based on specified rules (authorizations); whether the request should begranted or denied. The definition of an access control system is typically based on threeconcepts: access control policies; access control models; and access control mechanisms.In this chapter; we focus on the traditional access control models and policies. In particular;we review two of the most important policies: the discretionary and mandatory access controlpolicies. We therefore start the chapter with an overview of the basic concepts on whichaccess control systems are based. We then illustrate different traditional discretionary andmandatory access control policies and models that have been proposed in the literature;also investigating their low-level implementation in terms of security mechanisms.,*,2007,19
A middleware architecture for integrating privacy preferences and location accuracy,Claudio Agostino Ardagna; Marco Cremonini; Ernesto Damiani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Location-Based Access Control (LBAC) systems support the evaluation ofconditions on locations in the enforcement of access control policies. The ability to evaluateconditions on a set of authorized locations has a number of well-known advantages;including enriching access control expressiveness. However; when locations are used incombination with personal identities; users privacy must be considered. In this paper; wedescribe a solution to integrate a LBAC system with privacy-enhanced techniques based onlocation obfuscation. Our solution is based on a privacy-aware middleware component thatexplicitly addresses the trade-off between users privacy and location accuracy by satisfyingpreferences set by users and maximizing the quality of location information released toLBAC systems.,*,2007,19

Authorization enforcement in distributed query evaluation,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract We present a simple; yet powerful; approach for the specification and enforcementof authorizations regulating data release among data holders collaborating in a distributedcomputation; to ensure that query processing discloses only data whose release has beenexplicitly authorized. Data disclosure is captured by means of profiles; associated with eachdata computation; that describe the information carried by a base or a derived (ie; computedby a query) relation. We present an algorithm that; given a query plan; determines whether itcan be safely executed and produces a safe execution strategy for it.

In this paper; we discuss how standard XACMLpolicies can handle ontology-based resource and subject descriptions based on thestandard P3P base data schema. We show that XACML conditions can be transparentlyexpanded according to ontology-based models representing semantics.

Encryption and fragmentation for data confidentiality in the cloud,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Robert F Erbacher; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Giovanni Livraga; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Cloud computing has emerged as a successful paradigm allowing individual usersas well as companies to resort to external providers for storing/processing data or makingthem available to others. Together with the many benefits; cloud computing introduceshowever new security and privacy risks. A major issue is that the data owner; storing data atexternal providers; loses control over them; leaving them potentially exposed to improperaccess; use; or dissemination. In this chapter; we consider the problem of protectingconfidentiality of sensitive information when relying on external cloud providers for storingand processing data. We introduce confidentiality requirements and then illustrateencryption and data fragmentation as possible protection techniques.

Minimising disclosure of client information in credential–based interactions,Claudio A Ardagna; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,The advancements in ICT allow people to use and access resources and services on theweb anywhere and anytime. Servers offering resources typically require users to releaseinformation about them; which is then used to enforce possible access policies on theoffered services. Effective access to such resources requires the development ofapproaches for enabling the user to organise and manage all her credentials and regulatetheir release when interacting with other parties over the web. In this paper; we provide ameans for the user to specify how much she values the release of different properties;credentials; or combinations thereof as well as additional constraints that she might imposeon information disclosure.

Modality conflicts in semantics aware access control,Ernesto Damiani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Cristiano Fugazza; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Security is a crucial concern for commercial and mission critical applications in Web-based environments. Semantic Web-style context descriptions aim at supporting widespreaddistribution of resources and cooperation of autonomous agents on the Web in a secureway. In this paper; context information associated with Access Control (AC) managementpolicies is defined according to basic operators that can be represented using the WebOntology Language (OWL). The same primitives are used; in the specification ofauthorizations; to compose domain scope expressions. Standard inference procedures ofDescription Logics (DL) can then be used to check the consistency of context informationreferred to by policy conditions and; moreinterestingly; to pre-process context information forgrounding policy propagation and enabling conflict resolution.

The case for independent updates,Stefano Ceri; Maurice AW Houtsma; Arthur M Keller; Pierangela Samarati,The authors present the case for allowing independent updates on replicated databases. Inautonomous; heterogeneous; or large scale systems; using two-phase commit for updatesmay be infeasible. Instead; the authors propose that a site may perform updatesindependently. Sites that are available can receive these updates immediately. But sites thatare unavailable; or otherwise do not participate in the update transaction receive theseupdates later through propagation; rather than preventing the execution of the updatetransaction until sufficient sites can participate. Two or more sites come to agreement usinga reconciliation procedure that uses reception vectors to determine how much of the historylog should be transferred from one site to another. They also consider what events caninitiate a reconciliation procedure.,Management of Replicated Data; 1992.; Second Workshop on the,1992,16
Shuffle index: efficient and private access to outsourced data,Sabrina De Capitani Di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Gerardo Pelosi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Data outsourcing and cloud computing have been emerging at an ever-growingrate as successful approaches for allowing users and companies to rely on external servicesfor storing and managing data. As data and access to them are not under the control of thedata owner; there is a clear need to provide proper confidentiality protection. Suchrequirements concern the confidentiality not only of the stored data (content) but also of thespecific accesses (or patterns of them) that users make on such data. In this article; weaddress these issues and propose an approach for guaranteeing content; access; andpattern confidentiality in a data outsourcing scenario.

Extending loose associations to multiple fragments,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Giovanni Livraga; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Data fragmentation has been proposed as a solution for protecting theconfidentiality of sensitive associations when publishing data at external servers. To enrichthe utility of the published fragments; a recent approach has put forward the idea ofcomplementing them with loose associations; a sanitized form of the sensitive associationsbroken by fragmentation. The original proposal considers fragmentations composed of twofragments only; and supports the definition of a loose association between this pair offragments. In this paper; we extend loose associations to multiple fragments. We firstillustrate how the publication of multiple loose associations between pairs of fragments of ageneric fragmentation can potentially expose sensitive associations.

Supporting concurrency and multiple indexes in private access to outsourced data 1,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Gerardo Pelosi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Data outsourcing has recently emerged as a successful solution allowingindividuals and organizations to delegate data and service management to external thirdparties. A major challenge in the data outsourcing scenario is how to guarantee properprivacy protection against the external server. Recent promising approaches rely on theorganization of data in indexing structures that use encryption and the dynamic allocation ofencrypted data to physical blocks for destroying the otherwise static relationship betweendata and the blocks in which they are stored. However; dynamic data allocation implies theneed to re-write blocks at every read access; thus requesting exclusive locks that can affectconcurrency. Also; these solutions only support search conditions on the values of theattribute used for building the indexing structure.,Journal of Computer Security,2013,15

Trust management services in relational databases,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Trust management represents today a promising approach for supporting accesscontrol in open environments. While several approaches have been proposed for trustmanagement and significant steps have been made in this direction; a major obstacle thatstill exists in the realization of the benefits of this paradigm is represented by the lack ofadequate support in the DBMS. In this paper; we present a design that can be used toimplement trust management within current relational DBMSs. We propose a trust modelwith a SQL syntax and illustrate the main issues arising in the implementation of the modelin a relational DBMS. Specific attention is paid to the efficient verification of a delegationpath for certificates. This effort permits a relatively inexpensive realization of the services ofan advanced trust management model within current relational DBMSs.,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM symposium on Information; computer and communications security,2007,14

A discretionary access control model with temporal authorizations,Elisa Bertino; Claudio Bettini; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Conventional authorization models enforcing discretionary policies are based onauthorizations which specify; for each user or group of users in the system; the accesses heis allowed to execute on objects. We propose a new authorization model which allows toassociate with each authorization temporal constraints which restrict the validity of theauthorization. Moreover; in our model we allow the specification of temporal dependenciesamong authorizations. Temporal dependencies allow the derivation of new authorizationson the basis of the presence or of the absence of other authorizations in given time intervals.In the paper we present the main characteristics of our model and illustrate some researchissues we are currently investigating.,Proceedings of the 1994 workshop on New security paradigms,1994,14
Achieving incremental consistency among autonomous replicated databases,Stefano Ceri; Maurice AW Houtsma; Arthur M Keller; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract In this paper; we present methods for supporting autonomous updates in replicateddatabases. Autonomous updates are of particular importance to applications that cannottolerate the delay and vulnerability due to synchronous update methods (2PC). We separatethe notion of replication consistency; meaning that all copies have the same value andreflect the same update transactions; from behavior consistency; meaning that transactionexecution reflects all integrity constraints. The method proposed in this paper supportsindependent updates during network partitioning; and achieves a consistent final databasestate on recovery of partitions that reflects all actions that were executed during networkpartitioning. To this purpose; we describe a reconciliation procedure that applies all actionsto each updated data item in the order in which they were originally performed; possibly …,*,1993,14

A non-timestamped authorization model for data management systems,Elisa Bertino; Sushil Jajodia; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract There are two approaches to representing authorizations in data managementsystems. The first approach associates a timestamp with each authorization; semantics ofgrant and revoke operations on authorizations are based on the temporal relationshipsdetermined by these timestamps. The second approach differs from the first in that it doesnot assign timestamps to authorizations. Although the semantics of the grant and revokeoperation are different as a result; several systems have adopted this approach since it notonly simplifies management of authorizations; but appears to be more desirable from theuser's point of view as well. In this paper; we define a formal model for non-timestampedauthorizations that supports both positive and negative authorizations.

Inthis paper; we discuss how the use of indexes; typically associated with the encryptedportion of the data; while desirable for providing effectiveness and efficiency in queryexecution; can-combined with fragmentation-cause potential leakage of confidential(encrypted or fragmented) information. We illustrate how the exposure to leakage variesdepending on the kind of indexes. Such observations can result useful for the design ofapproaches assessing information exposure and for the definition of safe (free frominferences) indexes in fragmented data.,Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,12
Managing key hierarchies for access control enforcement: Heuristic approaches,Carlo Blundo; Stelvio Cimato; Sabrina de Capitani Di Vimercati; Alfredo De Santis; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Data outsourcing is emerging today as a successful paradigm allowing individualsand organizations to resort to external servers for storing their data; and sharing them withothers. The main problem of this trend is that sensitive data are stored on a site that is notunder the data owner's direct control. This scenario poses a major security problem sinceoften the external server is relied upon for ensuring high availability of the data; but it is notauthorized to read them. Data need therefore to be encrypted. In such a context; theapplication of an access control policy requires different data to be encrypted with differentkeys so to allow the external server to directly enforce access control and support selectivedissemination and access. The problem therefore emerges of designing solutions for theefficient management of an encryption policy enforcing access control; with the goal of …,computers & security,2010,12
Semantics-aware privacy and access control: Motivation and preliminary results,E Damiani; S De Capitani di Vimercati; C Fugazza; P Samarati,Abstract Semantic Web languages like OWL and RDFS promise to be viable means forrepresenting metadata describing users and resources available over the Internet. Recently;interest has been raised on the use of such languages to represent individual data itemscontained in Personally Identifiable Information (PII); supporting fine-grained release. Toachieve this goal; the informative content of a credential must be dissected into atomiccomponents so that users can selectively single out those to be released. In this paper; weoutline three different methodologies for taking advantage of fine-grained personalinformation for controlled release at both policy writing and evaluation time; and pinpointaspects that should be considered for an effective exchange and evaluation of policies.,Proceedings of 1st Italian Semantic Web Workshop,2004,12

Decentralized administration for a temporal access control model,Elisa Bertino; Claudio Bettini; Elena Ferrari; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract In this paper we present a temporal access control model that provides fordecentralized administration of authorizations. Each access authorization; negative orpositive; is associated with a time interval limiting its validity. When the interval expires; theauthorization is automatically revoked. The model also permits the specification of rules;based on four different temporal operators; to derive additional authorizations from thepresence or absence of other authorizations. Users creating objects can retain completecontrol over their objects or delegate other users the privilege of administering accesses onthe objects. Delegation can also be selectively enforced with reference to specific accessmodes or time intervals. The resulting model provides a high degree of flexibility and allowsto express several protection requirements which cannot be expressed in traditional …,Information Systems,1997,11

RETISS: A real time security system for threat detection using fuzzy logic,F Carrettoni; S Castano; G Martella; P Samarati,A real-time security system (RETISS) for threat detection is described; pointing out securityviolations in the target system under control. RETISS is based on the hypothesis that acorrelation exists between anomalous user behavior and threats. Security rules have beenenforced to express this correlation and to detect and evaluate the probability of a giventhreat; based on the level of danger of the occurrences of the anomalies symptomatic for thethreat. Levels of danger of all the anomalies are then fuzzy combined to express theprobability of the threat. RETISS is independent of any particular system and applicationenvironment.

Data security issues in cloud scenarios,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract The amount of data created; stored; and processed has enormously increased inthe last years. Today; millions of devices are connected to the Internet and generate a hugeamount of (personal) data that need to be stored and processed using scalable; efficient;and reliable computing infrastructures. Cloud computing technology can be used to respondto these needs. Although cloud computing brings many benefits to users and companies;security concerns about the cloud still represent the major impediment for its wide adoption.We briefly survey the main challenges related to the storage and processing of data in thecloud. In particular; we focus on the problem of protecting data in storage; supporting fine-grained access; selectively sharing data; protecting query privacy; and verifying the integrityof computations.,International Conference on Information Systems Security,2015,10
Enforcing confidentiality and data visibility constraints: an OBDD approach,Valentina Ciriani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Giovanni Livraga; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract The problem of enabling privacy-preserving data releases has become more andmore important in the last years thanks to the increasing needs of sharing and disseminatinginformation. In this paper we address the problem of computing data releases in the form offragments (vertical views) over a relational table; which satisfy both confidentiality andvisibility constraints; expressing needs for information protection and release; respectively.We propose a modeling of constraints and of the data fragmentation problem based onBoolean formulas and Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs). Exploiting OBDDs; weefficiently manipulate Boolean formulas; thus easily computing data fragments that satisfythe constraints.,*,2011,10

Managing privacy in LBAC systems,Claudio Agostino Ardagna; Marco Cremonini; Ernesto Damiani; S De Capitani di Vimercati; Pierangela Samarati,One of the main challenges for privacy-aware location-based systems is to strike a balancebetween privacy preferences set by users and location accuracy needed by location-basedservices (LBSs). To this end; two key requirements must be satisfied: the availability oftechniques providing for different degrees of user location privacy and the possibility ofquantifying such privacy degrees. To address the first requirement; we describe twoobfuscation techniques. For the second requirement; we introduce the notion of relevanceas the estimator for the degree of location obfuscation. This way; location obfuscation can beadjusted to comply with both user preferences and LBS accuracy requirements.,Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops; 2007; AINAW'07. 21st International Conference on,2007,10
Measuring inference exposure in outsourced encrypted databases,Ernesto Damiani; S De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Pierangela Samarati; Marco Viviani,Abstract Database outsourcing is becoming increasingly popular introducing a newparadigm; called database-as-a-service; where an encrypted client's database is stored atan external service provider. Existing proposals for querying encrypted databases are basedon the association; with each encrypted tuple; of additional indexing information obtainedfrom the plaintext values of attributes that can be used in the queries. However; therelationship between indexes and data should not open the door to inference and linkingattacks that can compromise the protection granted by encryption.,*,2005,10
New directions in access control,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Access control is the process of mediating every request to resources and datamaintained by a system and determining whether the request should be granted or denied.Traditionally; the access control process is based on a simple paradigm with basicfunctionalities (eg; simple authorization tuples); the access control rules are under thecontrol of a single party; and relying on user's authentication. The emerging open-basedscenarios make inapplicable traditional assumptions. In this paper we illustrate recentproposals and ongoing work addressing access control in emerging applications and newscenarios.,*,2005,10
Privacy and civil liberties,David Chadwick; M Olivier; Pierangela Samarati; Eleanor Sharpston; B Thuraisingham,In today's global information society; an increasing degree of awareness with respect to privacyis inevitable. Privacy issues have been the subject of public debates and discussions and manycontroversial proposals for the use of information have been debated openly. In the United Statesas well as in many European countries; privacy laws and regulations are being demanded;pro- posed and enforced; some still under study and the subject of debates. Privacy is a complextopic. First; privacy - a right we all agree that everybody should indeed enjoy - may conflict withaccountability; and then can open the door to abuses by malicious party.

Mix&Slice: Efficient access revocation in the cloud,Enrico Bacis; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Marco Rosa; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract We present an approach to enforce access revocation on resources stored atexternal cloud providers. The approach relies on a resource transformation that providesstrong mutual inter-dependency in its encrypted representation. To revoke access on aresource; it is then sufficient to update a small portion of it; with the guarantee that theresource as a whole (and any portion of it) will become unintelligible to those from whomaccess is revoked. The extensive experimental evaluation on a variety of configurationsconfirmed the effectiveness and efficiency of our solution; which showed excellentperformance and compatibility with several implementation strategies.,Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,2016,9

A decentralized temporal authorization model,Elisa Bertino; Claudio Bettini; Elena Ferrari; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract This paper describes a temporal authorization model with decentralizedadministration facilities. The model supports both positive and negative authorizations. Eachauthorization is associated with a time interval; limiting the validity of the authorization.Authorizations can be specified explicitly or derived through rules. Administration ofauthorizations is decentralized and is based on different types of administrative privilegestogether with the grant option. Revocation is recursive in that whenever a user is revoked anauthorization; the authorizations he granted may also be revoked.,*,1996,9
Protecting access confidentiality with data distribution and swapping,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Gerardo Pelosi; Pierangela Samarati,The protection of the confidentiality of outsourced data is an important problem. A criticalaspect is the ability to efficiently access data that are stored in an encrypted format; withoutgiving to the server managing access requests the ability to infer knowledge about the datacontent of the access executed by the clients. The approaches that have been proposed tosolve this problem rely on a continuous rewriting and re-encryption of the accessed data;like the shuffle index that has recently been proposed. We here propose a differentapproach that uses three independent servers to manage the data structure. The use ofthree servers is motivated by the increased protection that derives from the use ofindependent servers compared to the use of a single server. The protection shows toincrease in a significant way if a constraint is introduced that at every request an …,Big Data and Cloud Computing (BdCloud); 2014 IEEE Fourth International Conference on,2014,8

Mandatory security and object‐oriented systems: A multilevel entity model and its mapping onto a single‐level object model,Elisa Bertino; Elena Ferrari; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract The application of mandatory security policies in object-oriented systems requireobjects to be single-level; ie; all information in an object must have the same securityclassification. However; real-world entities are often multilevel. Moreover; differentcoexistence options for property values at different levels are needed. In this paper wepresent a model for specifying multilevel entities. The proposed entity model supportsdifferent options by which users can specify whether low level values of entity properties areto be considered valid at higher levels or whether they represent cover stories not valid athigher levels. We then illustrate how entities expressed in this model can be mapped ontosingle-level objects. We also present a methodology and algorithms to automatically performsuch a mapping.© 1998 John Wiley & Sons; Inc.,Theory and Practice of Object Systems,1998,8

Three-server swapping for access confidentiality,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Gerardo Pelosi; Pierangela Samarati,We propose an approach to protect confidentiality of data and accesses to them when dataare stored and managed by external providers; and hence not under direct control of theirowner. Our approach is based on the use of distributed data allocation among threeindependent servers and on a dynamic re-allocation of data at every access. Dynamic re-allocation is enforced by swapping data involved in an access across the servers in such away that accessing a given node implies re-allocating it to a different server; then destroyingthe ability of servers to build knowledge by observing accesses. The use of three serversprovides uncertainty; to the eyes of the servers; of the result of the swapping operation; evenin presence of collusion among them.,IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing,2015,7

Fine-grained disclosure of access policies,Claudio Agostino Ardagna; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Gregory Neven; Stefano Paraboschi; Franz-Stefan Preiss; Pierangela Samarati; Mario Verdicchio,Abstract In open scenarios; where servers may receive requests to access their servicesfrom possibly unknown clients; access control is typically based on the evaluation of(certified or uncertified) properties; that clients can present. Since assuming the client toknow a-priori the properties she should present to acquire access is clearly limiting; serversshould be able to respond to client requests with information on the access control policiesregulating access to the requested services. In this paper; we present a simple; yet flexibleand expressive; approach for allowing servers to specify disclosure policies; regulating ifand how access control policies on services can be communicated to clients. Our approachallows fine-grain specifications; thus capturing different ways in which policies; and portionsthereof; can be communicated.

Location-based metadata and negotiation protocols for LBAC in a one-to-many scenario,Claudio Agostino Ardagna; Marco Cremonini; Ernesto Damiani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract. Location-based Access Control (LBAC) techniques allow the definition of users'access rights based on location predicates that exploit the users' physical location. However;evaluating the physical location of a user is a specialized activity that is unlikely to beperformed by the same entity (eg; organization or system) in charge of the access controldecision. For this reason; location evaluation is usually assumed to be provided by specificLocation Services (LSs) possibly coexisting in a same area and competing one with theothers. In this paper; we address the issues related to the communication and negotiationbetween an Access Control Engine (ACE) enforcing access rules that include location-based predicates and multiple; functionally equivalent; LSs. We introduce metadata for theexchange of service level agreement attributes between the ACE and the LSs.

Recently; interest hasbeen raised on the use of such languages to represent individual data items contained inPersonally Identifiable Information (PII); supporting fine-grained release. To achieve thisgoal; the informative content of a credential must be dissected into atomic components sothat users can selectively single out those to be released.

An object-oriented security model for office environments,Silvana Castano; Pierangela Samarati,The authors present a security system for the protection of documents in an officeinformation system. The system takes into consideration aspects of both dynamic changingof user activities and document sharing. The model the system is built on is based on thedefinition of role as a set of actions and responsibilities associated with a particular workingactivity. Access authorizations are specified according to roles. The role played by a user ata specific time identifies the working environment of the user and hence the operations thathe/she can execute on documents. In modeling roles and documents the graph formalismand the inheritance mechanism are used. The use of an object-oriented programminglanguage in the system realization allows an easy representation of the characteristics of themodel.<< ETX>>,Security Technology; 1992.

A growingconcern related to this widespread diffusion of on-line applications that collect personalinformation is that users' privacy is often poorly managed and sometimes abused. Forinstance; it is well known how personal information is often disclosed to third parties withoutthe consent of legitimate data owners or that there are professional services specialized ongathering and correlating data from heterogeneous repositories; which permit to build userprofiles and possibly to disclose sensitive information not voluntarily released by theirowners. For these reasons; it has gained great importance to design systems able to fullypreserve information privacy by managing in a trustworthy and responsible way all …,*,2006,6

Propagation of authorizations in distributed database systems,Pierangela Samarati; Paul Ammann; Sushil Jajodia,Abstract We consider the propagation of authorizations in distributed database systems. If noconstraints are imposed on the propagation of authorization changes; then the authorizationstates at different sites may evolve inconsistently. A standard solution is to suppress thedistributed aspect and make all changes appear as if they had occurred in some serial orderat a single site; perhaps via an atomic commit protocol. However; rigid insistence onconsistency may result in authorization changes being needlessly delayed; a problemexacerbated in the context of site or communication failures. We propose an optimisticauthorization propagation algorithm. We specify an authorization table and a set ofoperations for altering the authorization table. Each site maintains a log of authorizationoperations.

In this position paper; we outline someemerging requirements and R&D challenges of privacy protection related to access controland discuss how they should be addressed in the framework of a comprehensive approachto privacy-aware access control.,Universita degli Studi di Milano; Dipartimento di Tecnologie dell ″Informazione,2006,5
Open World Reasoning in Semantics-Aware Access Control: a Preliminary Study,E Damiani; S David; S De Capitani di Vimercati; C Fugazza; P Samarati,Abstract. We address the relationships between theoretical foundations of DescriptionLogics and practical applications of security-oriented Semantic Web techniques. We firstdescribe the advantages of semantics-aware Access Control and review the state of the art;we also introduce the basics of Description Logics and the novel semantics they share. Thenwe translate the principle underlying the Little House Problem of DL into a real-world usecase: by applying Open World Reasoning to the Knowledge Base modelling a VirtualOrganization; we derive information not achievable with traditional Access Controlmethodologies. With this example; we also show that a general problem such as ontologymapping can take advantage of the enhanced semantics underlying OWL Lite and OWL DLto handle under-specified concepts.,Proc. 2nd Italian Semantic Web Workshop (SWAP 2005),2005,5

On Using Materialization Strategies for a Temporal Authorization Model.,Elena Ferrari; Elisa Bertino; Claudio Bettini; Alberto Motta; Pierangela Samarati,In this paper we show how materialization strategies can be successfully used for increasingthe e ciency of access control in a temporal authorization model [BBFS96a]. The temporalauthorization model allows to specify both temporal authorizations; that is; authorizationswith an interval of validity; and derivation rules; allowing new authorizations to be derived onthe basis of the presence or absence of other authorizations. These functionalities highlyincrease the expressive power of the model. However; they make the access control less ecient; as it may require the evaluation of several rules. For this reason an approach basedon materialization strategies has been adopted. Preliminary results on its performance areillustrated in this paper. View materialization has been a very active and fast growingresearch area in the past years [AB91; BS91; BCL89; CW91; CP84; DH84; GB95; GMR95 …,VIEWS,1996,5
Research issues in authorization models for hypertext systems,Elisa Bertino; Pierangela Samarati,The proper characteristics of hypertext systems; such as absence of a schema; connectionsamong the different" chunks" of information; and the possibility of navigating in the hypertext;make conventional authorization models inadequate for their protection. Thesecharacteristics on the one hand raise new protection requirements; thus making the problemof protection much harder; while on the other hand; they provide a flexibility in thespecification of authorizations which is greater than in more structured data models. We arecurrently working on an authorization model for the protection of information in distributedhypertext systems. In this paper; we illustrate the new requirements that arise and discusssome of the issues we are currently investigating.,New Security Paradigms Workshop; 1995. Proceedings,1995,5

Access control management for secure cloud storage,Enrico Bacis; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Marco Rosa; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract With the widespread success and adoption of cloud-based solutions; we arewitnessing an ever increasing reliance on external providers for storing and managing data.This evolution is greatly facilitated by the availability of solutions-typically based onencryption-ensuring the confidentiality of externally outsourced data against the storingprovider itself. Selective application of encryption (ie; with different keys depending on theauthorizations holding on data) provides a convenient approach to access control policyenforcement. Effective realization of such policy-based encryption entails addressingseveral problems related to key management; access control enforcement; andauthorization revocation; while ensuring efficiency of access and deployment with currenttechnology.

Practical techniques building on encryption for protecting and managing data in the cloud,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Giovanni Livraga; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Companies as well as individual users are adopting cloud solutions at an over-increasing rate for storing data and making them accessible to others. While migrating datato the cloud brings undeniable benefits in terms of data availability; scalability; and reliability;data protection is still one of the biggest concerns faced by data owners. Guaranteeing dataprotection means ensuring confidentiality and integrity of data and computations over them;and ensuring data availability to legitimate users. In this chapter; we survey someapproaches for protecting data in the cloud that apply basic cryptographic techniques;possibly complementing them with additional controls; to the aim of producing efficient andeffective solutions that can be used in practice.,*,2016,4

Location privacy in pervasive computing,Claudio A Ardagna; Marco Cremonini; S De Capitani di Vimercati; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Recent technological advances have made it feasible to measure and track thelocation of users; vehicles; and practically any mobile object. Positioning and trackingsystems are then collecting a huge amount of potentially sensitive location information;which is a set of data describing a user's location over a period of time. Since the activities ofa user are often related to the locations where such activities are performed; it is natural forusers to demand privacy; that is; to require control over the access to their locationinformation. In this chapter; we focus on the privacy aspects of using location information inlocation-based services (LBSs). LBSs are services that take the current position of the userinto consideration when performing their tasks. These services can be accessed from mobilephones; PDA; and any other mobile device. We start the chapter by characterizing the …,Security and privacy in mobile and wireless networking,2008,4

We give details of PGRIP's system-leveldesign and identify some conditions to rigorously guarantee the distributed fault tolerantdetection of anomalies. PGRIP detects integrity compromises of PNNI routing by enforcingrules that characterize topology information updates that are anomalous (or uncommon) withrespect to the network status; past events occurred; or statistical measures. Rules areexpressed in a flexible and expressive; yet simple; language using a tree structure toorganize and reference topology information maintained at each node.

Loose associations to increase utility in data publishing 1,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Giovanni Livraga; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Data fragmentation has been proposed as a solution for protecting theconfidentiality of sensitive associations when releasing data for publishing or externalstorage. To enrich the utility of data fragments; a recent approach has put forward the idea ofcomplementing a pair of fragments with some (non-precise; hence loose) information on theassociation between them. Starting from the observation that in presence of multiplefragments the publication of several independent associations between pairs of fragmentscan cause improper leakage of sensitive information; in this paper we extend looseassociations to operate over an arbitrary number of fragments.,Journal of Computer Security,2015,3
Selective and private access to outsourced data centers,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Giovanni Livraga; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract The advancements in the Information Technology and the rapid diffusion of novelcomputing paradigms have accelerated the trend of moving data to the cloud. Public andprivate organizations are more often outsourcing their data centers to the cloud for economicand/or performance reasons; thus making data confidentiality an essential requirement. Abasic technique for protecting data confidentiality relies on encryption: data are encrypted bythe owner before their outsourcing. Encryption however complicates both the queryevaluation and enforcement of access restrictions to outsourced data. In this chapter; weprovide an overview of the issues and techniques related to the support of selective andprivate access to outsourced data in a scenario where the cloud provider is trusted formanaging the data but not for reading their content.

In this context; theconcept of privacy control is introduced; and it should encompass three main aspects: toguarantee the desired level of privacy of information by controlling the access toservices/resources; to control secondary use of information disclosed for the purpose ofaccess control enforcement; to deal with the specific management of related privacyobligations [Cas04b](eg; data retention; data deletion; notifications).,*,2011,3
Supporting user privacy preferences on information release in open scenarios,CA Ardagna; S De Capitani di Vimercati; S Foresti; S Paraboschi; P Samarati,Abstract Access control solutions for open systems are typically based on the assumptionthat a client may adopt approached specifically designed for the server to protect thedisclosure of her sensitive information. These solutions however do not consider the specificprivacy requirements characterizing the client. In this paper; we put forward the idea ofadopting a different model at the client-side; aimed at minimizing the amount of sensitiveinformation released to a server. The model should be based on a formal modeling of theclient portfolio and should easily support the definition of privacy preferences and disclosurelimitations for empowering the user in the release of her personal information.,W3C Workshop on Privacy and data usage control,2010,3

Our solution relies on the grouping of resources into buckets then organizedwith a binary search tree. The tree is built on an index computed in a non-invertible non-order preserving way; and supports efficient key-based retrieval. Our approach to provideaccess privacy builds on this data organization providing uniform observability to the serverin access execution and dynamically changing not only the physical storage allocation; butalso the logical structure itself.

Managing Data Sharing in OpenStack Swift with Over-Encryption,Enrico Bacis; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Daniele Guttadoro; Stefano Paraboschi; Marco Rosa; Pierangela Samarati; Alessandro Saullo,Abstract The sharing of large amounts of data is greatly facilitated by the adoption of cloudstorage solutions. In many scenarios; this adoption could be hampered by possibleconcerns about data confidentiality; as cloud providers are not trusted to know the content ofthe data they store. Especially when the data are organized in objects; the application of anencryption layer is an interesting solution to this problem; because it offers strongconfidentiality guarantees with a limited performance overhead. In a data sharing scenario;the management of access privileges then requires an adequate support for key derivationand for managing policy evolution. We present a solution that provides transparent supportfor the encryption of objects stored on Swift.

A consensus-based approach for selecting cloud plans,Ala Arman; Sara Foresti; Giovanni Livraga; Pierangela Samarati,An important problem when moving an application to the cloud consists in selecting the mostsuitable cloud plan (among those available from cloud providers) for the applicationdeployment; with the goal of finding the best match between application requirements andplan characteristics. If a user wishes to move multiple applications at the same time; this taskcan be complicated by the fact that different applications might have different (and possiblycontrasting) requirements. In this paper; we propose an approach enabling users to select acloud plan that best balances the satisfaction of the requirements of multiple applications.Our solution operates by first ranking the available plans for each application (matching plancharacteristics and application requirements) and then by selecting; through a consensus-based process; the one that is considered more acceptable by all applications.,Research and Technologies for Society and Industry Leveraging a better tomorrow (RTSI); 2016 IEEE 2nd International Forum on,2016,2

An extended authorization model for object databases,Elisa Bertino; Fabio Origgi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Object-oriented database systems represent today one of the most promisingtechnology to a number of applications in business and industry. A serious problem withthese systems is that they do not provide adequate access control mechanisms forcontrolling access to information. One of the most significant proposal for the protection ofOODBMSs is represented by the Orion authorization model. In the Orion authorization modelseveral concepts have been introduced such as those of implicit/explicit and strong/weakauthorizations. However; the Orion authorization model suffers from some drawbacks andaddresses only partially some protection problems. In this paper we present an authorizationmodel for the protection of object-oriented database systems based on the types ofauthorizations introduced in the Orion authorization model. Although based on the same …,Journal of Computer Security,1995,2

Distributed Shuffle Index in the Cloud: Implementation and Evaluation,Enrico Bacis; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Marco Rosa; Pierangela Samarati,The distributed shuffle index strengthens the guarantees of access confidentiality providedby the shuffle index through the distribution of data among three cloud providers. In thispaper; we analyze architectural and design issues and describe an implementation of thedistributed shuffle index integrated with different cloud providers (ie; Amazon S3; OpenStackSwift; Google Cloud Storage; and EMC Elastic Cloud Storage). The experimental resultsobtained with our implementation confirm the protection guarantees provided by thedistributed shuffle index and its limited performance overhead; demonstrating its practicalapplicability in cloud scenarios.,Cyber Security and Cloud Computing (CSCloud); 2017 IEEE 4th International Conference on,2017,1
Supporting user privacy preferences in digital interactions,Sara Foresti; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract The quick development and widespread adoption of Internet technologies allowsservers to make available their services and resources to possibly unknown users anywhereand at any time. To regulate access to such services in open scenarios; servers requireusers to release their information through the disclosure of digital certificates. Since digitalcertificates and access control policies may include sensitive information; it is necessary todefine mechanisms that permit both the client and the server to specify privacy preferencesto be considered in credential and policy disclosure. In this chapter; we describe solutionssupporting both client privacy preferences; and server disclosure policies. We illustrate thedesiderata that these solutions should satisfy; and describe recent approaches that takeclient privacy preferences and server confidentiality into account in a negotiation process …,*,2017,1
Integrity for approximate joins on untrusted computational servers,Sabrina De Capitani Di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract In the last few years; many efforts have been devoted to the development ofsolutions aiming at ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data and computations in thecloud. In particular; a recent solution for verifying the integrity of equi-join queries is basedon the insertion of checks (markers and twins) whose presence provides probabilisticguarantees on the integrity of the computation. In this paper; we propose an approach forverifying the integrity of approximate join queries; which is based on the introduction of adiscretized version of the join attribute and on the translation of the approximate join into anequi-join defined over the discrete attribute added to the original relations. The proposedapproach guarantees the correctness and completeness of the join result; while causing alimited overhead for the user.,IFIP International Information Security Conference,2015,1

Database Security and Privacy.,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Sushil Jajodia; Pierangela Samarati,In the last few years; the wide availability of computational and storage resources at lowprices has substantially changed the way in which data are managed; stored; anddisseminated. As testified by the growing success of data outsourcing; cloud computing; andservices for sharing personal information (eg; Flickr; YouTube; Facebook); both individualsand companies are more and more resorting to external third parties for the management;storage; and (possibly selective) dissemination of their data. This practice has severaladvantages with respect to the in-house management of the data. First; the data ownerneeds neither to buy expensive hardware and software licenses nor to hire skilled personnelfor managing her data; thus having economic advantages. Second; the external serverguarantees high data availability and highly effective disaster protection. Third; even …,*,2014,1

Chinese Wall,Sabrina Vimercati; Pierangela Samarati,Background Mandatory policies guarantee better security than discretionary policies sincethey can also control indirect information flows (ie; mandatory policies enforce control on theflow of information once this information is acquired by a process). The application ofmandatory policies may however result too rigid. For instance; the strict application of the no-read-up and the no-write-down principles characterizing the secrecy-based multilevelpolicies may be too restrictive in several scenarios. The Chinese Wall policy aims atcombining the mandatory and discretionary principles with the goal of achieving mandatoryinformation flow protection without loosing the flexibility of discretionary authorizations.,*,2011,1
Clark and Wilson Model,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Pierangela Samarati,Background Integrity is concerned with ensuring that no resource; including data andprograms; has been modified in an unauthorized or improper way and that the data stored inthe system correctly reflect the real world they are intended to represent (ie; that usersexpect). Integrity preservation requires prevention of frauds and errors; as the term“improper” used above suggests: violations to data integrity are often enacted by legitimateusers executing authorized actions but misusing their privileges.,*,2011,1

Privacy-aware access control system: evaluation and decision,Claudio Agostino Ardagna; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Eros Pedrini; Pierangela Samarati,Introduction The success of the Web as a platform for the distribution of services anddissemination of information makes the protection of users' privacy a fundamentalrequirement. The privacy issues affect different aspects of today's Internet transactions;among which access control represents the most critical. An important step towards theprotection of privacy is then the definition of a privacy-aware access control system that; inaddition to server-side resources protection; provides users with solutions for preservingtheir privacy and managing their data. Although considerable work has been done in thefield of access control for distributed services [AHK+ 03; AHKS02; BS02a; eXt05; Wor02];available access control mechanisms are at an early stage from a privacy protection point ofview. This situation reflects the fact that in the last years the variety of security …,*,2011,1
Personal privacy in mobile networks,Claudio A Ardagna; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Technical enhancements of mobile technologies and the pervasive diffusion ofmobile devices have radically changed the way in which users communicate and interact.Users stay virtually connected anywhere anytime; and information on their location andmobility is easily available and accessible. As a consequence; new mobile and onlineapplications have been developed; which need the location information of the users to offerenhanced services. However; the availability of such advanced services and functionalitiescomes at the price of an increasing risk of privacy attacks that aim at monitoring users inevery move and activity. This scenario results in a renewed interest in solutions forprotecting the privacy of mobile users; especially in those environments where lack ofprotection may result in persecution; political violence; and government abuses. This …,*,2011,1
Multilevel Database,Pierangela Samarati; Giovanni Livraga,Electronic information stored and processed in computers and transferred overcommunication networks is vulnerable to both passive and active attacks. In a passiveattack; the opponent tries to obtain information on the data sent; in an active attack; theopponent will attempt to modify the information itself; the claimed sender; and/or intendedrecipient. Cryptographic techniques for information authentication focus on the origin of thedata (data origin authentication) and on the integrity of the data; that is; the fact that the datahas not been modified. Other aspects that can be important are the timeliness; the sequencewith respect to other messages; and the intended recipient (s). Information authentication isparticularly relevant in the context of financial transactions and electronic commerce. Otherapplications where information authentication plays an important role are alarm systems …,*,2011,1

Hardware and software data security,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Pierangela Samarati; Sushil Jajodia,Summary Data security refers to the protection of information against possible violations thatcan compromise its secrecy; confidentiality; integrity; or availability. Secrecy is compromisedif information is disclosed to unauthorized subjects. Integrity is compromised if information ismodified in an unauthorized or improper way. Availability is compromised if users areprevented from exercising authorized access (denial-of-service). Guaranteeing data securityrequires the establishment and enforcement of different kinds of controls; including theidentification and authentication of the different parties in a system (eg; users andmachines); the enforcement of rules regulating access to the system and its resources; theuse of encryption techniques to protect information in storage or in transit over the network;and the post-facto examination of all the activities in a system to point out vulnerabilities …,Computer Science and Engineering,2009,1

Semantics-aware perimeter protection,Marco Cremonini; Ernesto Damiani; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Web services security is becoming a critical concern for any organization adoptingthe XML-based Web services approach to application integration. While many accesscontrol techniques for Web services are becoming available; several issues still need to besolved in order to correctly split the burden of securing Web services between the perime-tral and the service level. In this paper; a technique is presented able to make perimetraldefences semantics-aware. Application-level semantics-aware firewalls enforce filteringrules directly on SOAP messages based on the nature of the services they request. Oursemantics-aware firewalls rules are written using a flexible XML-based syntax that allowssharing metadata concepts with service level access control policies; supporting complexsecurity policies that integrate perimetral defences with access control.

Global infrastructure protection system 1,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Patrick Lincoln; Livio Ricciulli; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract The development of new classes of distributed applications such as telephony;remote video; and virtual reality introduces new quality requirements that make inadequateeven the current best-effort service model provided by international networks. Recentresearch activity has proposed new approaches to accommodate these new applicationrequirements. While exploiting the resource needs of different applications to use thenetwork resources efficiently; these approaches require the maintenance of a considerableamount of state information at the network nodes. Correctness and availability of suchinformation are the basic requirements for the proper working of the network.,Journal of Computer Security,2001,1
Confidentiality Protection in Large Databases,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Giovanni Livraga; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract A growing trend in today's society is outsourcing large databases to the cloud. Thispermits to move the management burden from the data owner to external providers; whichcan make vast and scalable infrastructures available at competitive prices. Since largedatabases can include sensitive information; effective protection of data confidentiality is akey issue to fully enable data owners to enjoy the benefits of cloud-based solutions. Dataencryption and data fragmentation have been proposed as two natural solutions forprotecting data confidentiality. However; their adoption does not permit to completelydelegate query evaluation at the provider. In this chapter; we illustrate some encryption-based and fragmentation-based solutions for protecting data confidentiality; discussing alsohow they support query execution.,*,2018,*
Supporting User Requirements and Preferences in Cloud Plan Selection,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Giovanni Livraga; Vincenzo Piuri; Pierangela Samarati,With the cloud emerging as a successful paradigm for conveniently storing; accessing;processing; and sharing information; the cloud market has seen an incredible growth. Anever-increasing number of providers offer today several cloud plans; with differentguarantees in terms of service properties such as performance; cost; or security. While sucha variety naturally corresponds to a diversified user demand; it is far from trivial for users toidentify the cloud providers and plans that better suit their specific needs.

Polyinstantiation,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Pierangela Samarati,Background Multilevel mandatory policies can be applied to databases at differentgranularity levels [7]. Classification can in fact be considered at the level of relations;columns; tuples; or at the level of single cells; this latter being the finest possibleclassification. Several efforts to classifying information in database systems consideredclassification at the level of each single element [3; 5] or at the level of key or non-keyattributes within each tuple [9]. In a multilevel database; subjects can only see informationclassified at a level lower than their levels and; operating on the database; should not obtaininformation at higher or incomparable classification; or tamper it. Maintaining such principlesintroduces the problem of maintaining multiple instances of the same real world fact atdifferent classification; introducing polyinstantiation [2; 4].,*,2011,*
Administrative Policies,Pierangela Samarati,Background An access control service controls every access to a system and its resources toensure that all and only authorized accesses can take place. To this purpose; access controlis based on access rules defining which accesses are (or are not) to be allowed. Anadministrative policy is therefore needed to regulate the specification of such rules; that is; todefine who can add; delete; or modify them. Administrative policies are one of the mostimportant; though less understood; aspects in access control. Indeed; they have usuallyreceived little consideration; and; while it is true that a simple administrative policy wouldsuffice for many applications; it is also true that new applications (and organizationalenvironments) would benefit from the enrichment of administrative policies.,*,2011,*
Flexible Authorization Framework (FAF),Pierangela Samarati,Background The definition of access control policies (and their corresponding models) is farfrom being a trivial process. One of the major difficulty lies in the interpretation of; oftencomplex and sometimes ambiguous; real-world security policies and in their translation inwell-defined and unambiguous rules enforceable by a computer system. Many real-worldsituations have complex policies; where access decisions depend on the application ofdifferent rules coming; for example; from laws; practices; and organizational regulations. Asecurity policy must capture all the different regulations to be enforced and; in addition; mustalso consider possible additional threats due to the use of a computer system. Given thecomplexity of the scenario; there is a need for flexible; powerful; and expressive accesscontrol services to accommodate all the different requirements that may need to be …,*,2011,*
Privileges in SQL,Sabrina De Capitani Di Vimercati; Giovanni Livraga,Background In an ad hoc network; nodes form the network collaboratively without using anyinfrastructure. Different from the Internet; ad hoc nodes are both end hosts and routers. Inorder to deliver packets; they must ask other nodes to forward packets in the network. Suchcooperation is critical to the aliveness of the network. However; since nodes are not trustablein ad hoc networks; a malicious or a compromised node; residing on a path; can droppackets forwarded along that path. Such malicious actions disrupt normal packet forwardingand may further cause denial of service (DoS) or change the network-routing topology.,*,2011,*

Privacy in the electronic society: Emerging problems and solutions,Claudio A Ardagna; Marco Cremonini; Ernesto Damiani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract As the global information infrastructure is becoming more ubiquitous; digitalbusiness transactions are increasingly performed using a variety of mobile devices andacross multiple communication channels. This new service-oriented paradigm is making theprotection of privacy an increasing concern; as it relies on rich context representations (eg;of location and purpose) and requires users to provide a vast amount of information aboutthemselves and their behavior. This information is likely to be protected by a privacy policy;but restrictions to be enforced may come from different input requirements; possibly underthe control of different authorities. In addition; users retain little control over their personalinformation once it has been disclosed to third parties. Secondary use regulations aretherefore increasingly demanding attention. In this paper; we present the emerging trends …,*,2009,*

Access Control,Sabrina De Capitani diVimercati; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,An important requirement of any system is to protect its data and resources againstunauthorized disclosure (secrecy or confidentiality) and unauthorized or impropermodifications (integrity); while at the same time ensuring their availability to legitimate users(no denial-of-service or availability)(Samarati and De Capitani di Vimercati 2001). Theproblem of ensuring protection has existed since information has been managed. However;as technology advances and information management systems become more and morepowerful; the problem of enforcing information security also becomes more critical. Thedevelopment of information technology in the past few years has led to the widespread useof computer systems to store and manipulate information and has greatly increased theavailability; the processing power; and the storage power of information systems …,Handbook of Computer Networks: Distributed Networks; Network Planning; Control; Management; and New Trends and Applications; Volume 3,2008,*

Negotiation protocols for LBAC systems,C Ardagna; M Cremonini; E Damiani; S De Capitani Di Vimercati; P Samarati,Location-based Access Control (LBAC) systems are based on applications whose accesscontrol policies include location predicates. The enforcement of location predicates isperformed by an Access Control Engine (ACE) and requires complex location servicesintegrating sensing technologies able to gather users' physical location and componentsthat process this information according to LBAC specifications. A specialized LocationMiddleware (LM) provides such location services. In this paper; we consider that the qualityof such particular location services could be adjusted according to different Service LevelAgreements (SLAs) expressed through the exchange of specific metadata. To this end; weaddress the issue of negotiating location service attributes between an ACE and a LM andintroduce some protocols to carry out this coordination process.

Editorial Message: special track on computer security,Giampaolo Bella; Ronaldo Menezes; James Whittaker,Abstract The proliferation of network computing and especially the ubiquity of the Internethas made security one of the key areas in modern computing. This track aims at bringingtogether researchers working on applied issues in computer and information security;ranging from protocols and tools to policy and laws. Security is a multidisciplinary topicrelated to almost every aspect of computer science. From information security to mobilecomputation; from artificial intelligence to wireless communication; it is difficult to find acomputer science area that is not concerned with security directly or indirectly. TheComputer Security Track in the 2002 Symposium on Applied Computing is a demonstrationof the diversity. The track focus is on practical (applied) aspects of computer security so as tofit well with the general objectives of the symposium.,Proceedings of the 2002 ACM symposium on Applied computing,2002,*

At the heart of each such information system; there is a database.Typically; a database is built to store logically interrelated data representing some aspects ofthe real world; which must be collected; processed; and made accessible to a given userpopulation. The database is constructed according to a data model that defines the way inwhich data and interrelationships between them can be represented. The collection ofsoftware programs that provide the functionalities for defining; maintaining; and accessingdata stored in a database is called a database management system (DBMS).,Wiley Encyclopedia of Software Engineering,2002,*

Classifying Information for External Release,Steven Dawson; S De Capitani di Vimercati; Patrick Lincoln; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Organizations in the private; public; and governmental sectors are more and morerequired to make their data available on the Internet. This demand often involves archivaldata maintained at the organization; which must be disclosed selectively. We illustrate anapproach to classifying information for external release that guarantees protection ofsensitive data while maximizing information release.,IFIP International Information Security Conference,2000,*

Special issue on Security in the World Wide Web (WWW),Elisa Bertino; Pierangela Samarati; Gian Paolo Rossi,Despite its initial goal as a tool to support scientists in their research; the World Wide Web(WWW) has today become essential whenever information needs to be widely and rapidlydisseminated. WWW is now used in a large variety of organizations; including social;business; and government organizations; and applications; such as education;entertainment and commerce. As an increasing number of organizations and applicationsstart depending on WWW for some of their functions; security becomes crucial. Moreover;the novel applications; enabled by WWW; introduce new security requirements and raiseissues that have not been addressed before. The focus of this special issue is on researchand development efforts leading to identify requirements and viable solutions for WWWsecurity.

Set-Oriented retrieval of complex objects in inheritance hierarchies,Filippo Cacace; P Samarati; Letizia Tanca,Abstract Many object oriented data models have been proposed in the past few years; andthis field is one of the most promising for the development of new generation databasesystems. With complex data structures where an ISA hierarchy has been defined; theproblem of efficiently storing and retrieving (a collection of) objects increases its relevancedramatically.

Enforcing authorizations while protecting access confidentiality,Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Sara Foresti; Stefano Paraboschi; Gerardo Pelosi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract. Cloud computing is the reference paradigm to provide data storage andmanagement in a convenient and scalable manner. However; moving data to the cloudraises several issues; including the confidentiality of data and of accesses that are no moreunder the direct control of the data owner. The shuffle index has been proposed as asolution for addressing these issues when data are stored at an external third party. In thispaper; we extend the shuffle index with support for access control; that is; for enforcingauthorizations on data. Our approach is based on the use of selective encryption and on theorganization of data and authorizations in two shuffle indexes. Owners regulate access totheir data through authorizations that allow different users to access different portions of thedata; while; at the same time; the confidentiality of accesses is guaranteed. The proposed …,Journal of Computer Security,*,*

Internet users find in P2P applications a convenient solution for the anonymous exchangeof resources. The research community has looked with interest to the huge success that theseapplications were achieving and it has started to investigate many issues that arise in thiscontext; like per- formance; usability; and robustness. These architectures appear as an interestingparadigm for the development of many novel network applications. One of the urgent issuesto be investigated is the definition of security mech- anisms that would permit to reduce the risksthat are currently faced by users of these applications. Anonymity of the interaction is one of themajor reasons of the success of these solutions; but it usually implies that no guarantee …,*,*,*

Notes for the panel “Privacy Issues in WWW and Data Mining”,Pierangela Samarati,The increased power and interconnectivity of computer systems available today provide theability of storing and processing large amounts of data; resulting in networked informationaccessible from anywhere at any time. It is becoming increasingly easier to collect;exchange; access; process; and link information. In this global picture; people lose control ofwhat information others collect about them; how it is used; and how; and to whom it isdisclosed. While before; when releasing some information (be it our health situation to adoctor or our credit card number to a restaurant waiter) we needed to trust a specific personor organization; we now have to worry about putting trust; or some control; over the entirenetwork. It is therefore inevitable that we have an increasing degree of awareness withrespect to privacy. Privacy issues have been the subject of public debates and …,*,*,*
Regulating Exceptions in Healthcare using Policy Spaces,S Jajodia3 P Samarati,Abstract. One truth holds for the healthcare industry-nothing should interfere with thedelivery of care. Given this fact; the access control mechanisms used in healthcare toregulate and restrict the disclosure of data are often bypassed. This “break the glass”phenomenon is an established pattern in healthcare organizations and; though quite usefuland mandatory in emergency situations; it represents a serious system weakness. In thispaper; we propose an access control solution aimed at a better management of exceptionsthat occur in healthcare. Our solution is based on the definition of different policy spacesregulating access to patient data and used to balance the rigorous nature of traditionalaccess control systems with the prioritization of care delivery.,*,*,*

SupP2PRep: A Protocol for Reputation Management via Polling in P2P Networks with SuperPeers,Shalendra Chhabra; Ernesto Damiani; Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati; Stefano Paraboschi; Pierangela Samarati,Abstract Peer-to-Peer (P2P) applications have recently seen an enormous success andhave reached millions of users. The main reason of this success is the anonymity the usersenjoy. However; as recent experiences with P2P networks such as Gnutella show; thisanonymity offers an opportunity to exploit the network for abuses such as the spread ofmalware (worms; Trojan Horses; viruses; and spam). In this paper we extend our previouswork on P2PRep; a reputation management protocol for pure P2P networks; in the case of adistributed architecture with SuperPeers such as Gnutella 0.6 and KaZaA. We present thedesign and implementation of reputation-aware servents. We also propose the use ofrepeaters among SuperPeers to facilitate interaction between servents behind the firewalls.We finally study the case of malicious peers; malicious SuperPeers and malicious …,*,*,*

Testimonia questa tendenza l'interessecrescente per i sistemi peer-to-peer; quali ad esempio Gnutella; da parte della comunità scientificaed industriale … Tali sistemi; nei quali ogni nodo; denominato servent; svolge mansioni siadi server sia di client; sono caratterizzati da un lato da requisiti di privatezza e dall'altro diprotezione. Da un lato i par- tecipanti; infatti; non vogliono che la loro attività e le loro transazionisiano registrabili.
