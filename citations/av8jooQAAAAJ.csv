The hyperion project: from data integration to data coordination,Marcelo Arenas; Vasiliki Kantere; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Iluju Kiringa; Renée J Miller; John Mylopoulos,Abstract We present an architecture and a set of challenges for peer database managementsystems. These systems team up to build a network of nodes (peers) that coordinate at runtime most of the typical DBMS tasks such as the querying; updating; and sharing of data.Such a network works in a way similar to conventional multidatabases. Conventionalmultidatabase systems are founded on key concepts such as those of a global schema;central administrative authority; data integration; global access to multiple databases;permanent participation of databases; etc. Instead; our proposal assumes total absence ofany central authority or control; no global schema; transient participation of peer databases;and constantly evolving coordination rules among databases. In this work; we describe thestatus of the Hyperion project; present our current solutions; and outline remaining …,ACM SIGMOD Record,2003,227
Managing scientific data,Anastasia Ailamaki; Verena Kantere; Debabrata Dash,Data-oriented scientific processes depend on fast; accurate analysis of experimental data generatedthrough empirical observation and simulation. However; scientists are increasingly overwhelmedby the volume of data produced by their own experiments. With improving instrument precisionand the complexity of the simulated models; data overload promises to only get worse. The inefficiencyof existing database management systems (DBMSs) for addressing the requirements of scientistshas led to many application-specific systems. Unlike their general-purpose counterparts; thesesystems require more resources; hindering reuse of knowledge. Still; the data-management communityaspires to general-purpose scientific data management.

Optimal service pricing for a cloud cache,Verena Kantere; Debabrata Dash; Gregory Francois; Sofia Kyriakopoulou; Anastasia Ailamaki,Cloud applications that offer data management services are emerging. Such clouds supportcaching of data in order to provide quality query services. The users can query the clouddata; paying the price for the infrastructure they use. Cloud management necessitates aneconomy that manages the service of multiple users in an efficient; but also; resource-economic way that allows for cloud profit. Naturally; the maximization of cloud profit givensome guarantees for user satisfaction presumes an appropriate price-demand model thatenables optimal pricing of query services. The model should be plausible in that it reflectsthe correlation of cache structures involved in the queries. Optimal pricing is achieved basedon a dynamic pricing scheme that adapts to time changes.

An economic model for self-tuned cloud caching,Debabrata Dash; Verena Kantere; Anastasia Ailamaki,Cloud computing; the new trend for service infrastructures requires user multi-tenancy aswell as minimal capital expenditure. In a cloud that services large amounts of data that aremassively collected and queried; such as scientific data; users typically pay for queryservices. The cloud supports caching of data in order to provide quality query services. Userpayments cover query execution costs and maintenance of cloud infrastructure; and incurcloud profit. The challenge resides in providing efficient and resource-economic queryservices while maintaining a profitable cloud. In this work we propose an economic modelfor self-tuned cloud caching targeting the service of scientific data. The proposed economy isadapted to policies that encourage high-quality individual and overall query services butalso brace the profit of the cloud. We propose a cost model that takes into account all …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,87
Top-k dominant web services under multi-criteria matching,Dimitrios Skoutas; Dimitris Sacharidis; Alkis Simitsis; Verena Kantere; Timos Sellis,Abstract As we move from a Web of data to a Web of services; enhancing the capabilities ofthe current Web search engines with effective and efficient techniques for Web servicesretrieval and selection becomes an important issue. Traditionally; the relevance of a Webservice advertisement to a service request is determined by computing an overall score thataggregates individual matching scores among the various parameters in their descriptions.Two drawbacks characterize such approaches. First; there is no single matching criterionthat is optimal for determining the similarity between parameters. Instead; there arenumerous approaches ranging from using Information Retrieval similarity metrics up tosemantic logic-based inference rules. Second; the reduction of individual scores to anoverall similarity leads to significant information loss. Since there is no consensus on how …,Proceedings of the 12th international conference on extending database technology: advances in database technology,2009,67
On-line discovery of hot motion paths,Dimitris Sacharidis; Kostas Patroumpas; Manolis Terrovitis; Verena Kantere; Michalis Potamias; Kyriakos Mouratidis; Timos Sellis,Abstract We consider an environment of numerous moving objects; equipped with location-sensing devices and capable of communicating with a central coordinator. In this setting; weinvestigate the problem of maintaining hot motion paths; ie; routes frequently followed bymultiple objects over the recent past. Motion paths approximate portions of objects'movement within a tolerance margin that depends on the uncertainty inherent in positionalmeasurements. Discovery of hot motion paths is important to applications requiringclassification/profiling based on monitored movement patterns; such as targeted advertising;resource allocation; etc. To achieve this goal; we delegate part of the path extraction processto objects; by assigning to them adaptive lightweight filters that dynamically suppressunnecessary location updates and; thus; help reducing the communication overhead.

Efficient semantic web service discovery in centralized and P2P environments,Dimitrios Skoutas; Dimitris Sacharidis; Verena Kantere; Timos Sellis,Abstract Efficient and scalable discovery mechanisms are critical for enabling service-oriented architectures on the Semantic Web. The majority of currently existing approachesfocuses on centralized architectures; and deals with efficiency typically by pre-computingand storing the results of the semantic matcher for all possible query concepts. Suchapproaches; however; fail to scale with respect to the number of service advertisements andthe size of the ontologies involved. On the other hand; this paper presents an efficient andscalable index-based method for Semantic Web service discovery that allows for fastselection of services at query time and is suitable for both centralized and P2Penvironments. We employ a novel encoding of the service descriptions; allowing the matchbetween a request and an advertisement to be evaluated in constant time; and we index …,International Semantic Web Conference,2008,51
Coordinating peer databases using ECA rules,Vasiliki Kantere; Iluju Kiringa; John Mylopoulos; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Marcelo Arenas,Abstract Peer databases are stand-alone; independently developed databases that arelinked to each other through acquaintances. They each contain local data; a set of mappingtables and expressions; and a set of ECA rules that are used to exchange data among them.The set of acquaintances and peers constitutes a dynamic peer-to-peer network in whichacquaintances are continuously established and abolished. We present techniques forspecifying data exchange policies on-the-fly based on constraints imposed on the way inwhich peers exchange and share data. We realize the on-the-fly specification of dataexchange policies by building coordination ECA rules at acquaintance time. Finally; wedescribe mechanisms related to establishing and abolishing acquaintances by means ofexamples.

GrouPeer: Dynamic clustering of P2P databases,Verena Kantere; Dimitrios Tsoumakos; Timos Sellis; Nick Roussopoulos,Abstract Sharing structured data in a P2P network is a challenging problem; especially in theabsence of a mediated schema. The standard practice of answering a consecutivelyrewritten query along the propagation path often results in significant loss of information. Onthe opposite; the use of mediated schemas requires human interaction and globalagreement; both during creation and maintenance. In this paper we present GrouPeer; anadaptive; automated approach to both issues in the context of unstructured P2P databaseoverlays. By allowing peers to individually choose which rewritten version of a query toanswer and evaluate the received answers; information-rich sources left hidden otherwiseare discovered. Gradually; the overlay is restructured as semantically similar peers areclustered together. Experimental results show that our technique produces very accurate …,Information Systems,2009,47
Storing and indexing spatial data in p2p systems,Verena Kantere; Spiros Skiadopoulos; Timos Sellis,The peer-to-peer (P2P) paradigm has become very popular for storing and sharinginformation in a totally decentralized manner. At first; research focused on P2P systems thathost 1D data. Nowadays; the need for P2P applications with multidimensional data hasemerged; motivating research on P2P systems that manage such data. The majority of theproposed techniques are based either on the distribution of centralized indexes or on thereduction of multidimensional data to one dimension. Our goal is to create from scratch atechnique that is inherently distributed and also maintains the multidimensionality of data.Our focus is on structured P2P systems that share spatial information.

Predicting cost amortization for query services,Debabrata Dash; Georgios Gratsias; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract Emerging providers of online services offer access to data collections. Such dataservice providers need to build data structures; eg materialized views and indexes; in orderto offer better performance for user query execution. The cost of such structures is charged tothe user as part of the overall query service cost. In order to ensure the economic viability ofthe provider; the building and maintenance cost of new structures has to be amortized to aset of prospective query services that will use them. This work proposes a novel stochasticmodel that predicts the extent of cost amortization in time and number of services. The modelis completed with a novel method that regresses query traffic statistics and provides input tothe prediction model. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the prediction model; westudy its application on an extension of an existing economy model for the management …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,27

A SLA graph model for data services,Katerina Stamou; Verena Kantere; Jean-Henry Morin; Michael Georgiou,Abstract Cloud computing has given rise to on-demand service provisioning and massiveoutsourcing of IT infrastructures and applications to virtual; commoditized ones. Despite thebroad Service Level Agreement (SLA) usage in scientific settings; their role in cloud marketsis peripheral and misinterpreted. The paper introduces a SLA graph data model thatsupports automated SLA formalization and data management through a property digraph.The data model is described as a directed graph (digraph). We elaborate on node and edgeproperties that indicate dependencies in the SLA data management flow. We sketch arealistic scenario of cloud data service provisioning to extract attributes that characterize thedata service. The SLA graph model and data service attributes are used to demonstrate theformalization of a SLA template that is managed as a property graph.

SLA template filtering: a faceted approach,Katerina Stamou; Verena Kantere; Jean-Henry Morin,Abstract—With the commoditization of cloud computing; more and more companies prefer tooutsource IT resources into virtual infrastructures. Service Level Agreements (SLAs) can behelpful to make the right investment decision. A SLA template represents the pre-agreedSLA state. A service provider proposes the SLA content and submits the template to amarketplace for customer consideration. Customers use SLA template views as” What YouSee Is What You Get”(WYSIWIG) snapshots prior to service selection and before agreementinitialization. The paper proposes a filtering framework that is based on a faceted approachand that uses SLA templates to guide marketplace customers through available services.The framework design is presented along with the data-model of SLA templates.

Using ECA rules to implement mobile query agents for fast-evolving pure P2P database systems,Verena Kantere; Aris Tsois,Abstract A challenging issue in fast-evolving pure P2P networks is the design of anappropriate mechanism for processing queries. Since both the data content of the peers aswell as their acquaintances; change rapidly the typical P2P querying techniques becomeinappropriate. We are interested in P2P networks where peers are mobile and own adatabase. In this dynamic context the usage of a Mobile Agent framework appears verypromising. The paper investigates the issues related to the above problem and proposes aP2P and Mobile Agent architecture based on Active Database technology. We argue that;the employment of ECA rules both for answering queries and deploying agents leads to anefficient as well as simple query processing technique. Furthermore; the proposed mobileagent system architecture offers a number of advantages due to the performance and …,Proceedings of the 6th international conference on Mobile data management,2005,13

I/O performance modeling for big data applications over cloud infrastructures,Ioannis Mytilinis; Dimitrios Tsoumakos; Verena Kantere; Anastassios Nanos; Nectarios Koziris,Big Data applications receive an ever-increasing amount of attention; thus becoming adominant class of applications that are deployed over virtualized environments. Cloudenvironments entail a large amount of complexity relative to I/O performance. The use of BigData increases the complexity of I/O management as well as its characterization andprediction: As I/O operations become growingly dominant in such applications; theintricacies of virtualization; different storage back ends and deployment setups significantlyhinder our ability to analyze and correctly predict I/O performance. To that end; this workproposes an end-to-end modeling technique to predict performance of I/O--intensive BigData applications running over cloud infrastructures.

A holistic framework for big scientific data management,Verena Kantere,Most of the domains of science are facing an explosion in the data that they have to collectand process in order to conduct research. This is true for both: scientific domains dealingwith experimental data; eg biology; sociology; astronomy etc; but also scientific domainsdealing with simulation data; eg seismology; physics etc. To maximize the potential outcomeof scientific data analysis; respective data management applications need to fulfil thefollowing coarse tasks: fast on-demand data processing; and effective storage andconsolidation of diverse data collections. These two tasks are in general hard to realizebecause of:(a) the big data size;(b) the diversity of data formats;(c) their conceptualdependencies;(d) disperse data locations; and (e) intensive and systematic nature ofscientific queries.

Ontology-based data sharing in P2P databases,Dimitrios Skoutas; Verena Kantere; Alkis Simitsis; Timos Sellis,Abstract We consider peer-to-peer systems in which peers share structured data through theuse of schema mappings. Peers express their queries and rewrite incoming queries on theirlocal schema. We assume the existence of one or more ontologies describing the domain ofinterest of the peers. The ontologies are used to semantically annotate each peer schema;making explicit the type of information provided by it. A major problem in such a system isthat peers cannot easily judge the semantic relativeness of their interests to interests of otherpeers; as these are expressed by the respective local schemas. Moreover; peers cannotevaluate the semantic relativeness of answers that they receive to their queries. In thispaper; we propose a semantic similarity measure for evaluating the semantic relativenessbetween peer schemas; as well as between queries and their rewritten versions on other …,*,2008,9
Adaptive query execution for data management in the cloud,Adrian Daniel Popescu; Debabrata Dash; Verena Kantere; Anastasia Ailamaki,Abstract A major component of many cloud services is query processing on data stored inthe underlying cloud cluster. The traditional techniques for query processing on a cluster arethose offered by parallel DBMS. These techniques however; cannot guarantee highperformance for cloud; parallel DBMS lack adequate fault tolerance mechanisms in order todeal with non-negligible software and hardware failures. MapReduce; on the other hand;allows query processing solutions that are fault tolerant; but imposes substantial overheads.In this paper; we propose an adaptive software architecture which can effortlessly switchbetween MapReduce and parallel DBMS in order to efficiently process queries regardless oftheir response times. Switching between the two architectures is performed in a transparentmanner based on an intuitive cost model; which computes the expected execution time in …,Proceedings of the second international workshop on Cloud data management,2010,8
A framework for semantic grouping in P2P databases,Verena Kantere; Dimitrios Tsoumakos; Timos Sellis,Abstract Sharing of structured data in decentralized environments is a challenging problem;especially in the absence of a global schema. Social network structures map network links tosemantic relations between participants in order to assist in efficient resource discovery andinformation exchange. In this work; we propose a scheme that automates the process ofcreating schema synopses from semantic clusters of peers which own autonomousrelational databases. The resulting mediated schemas can be used as global interfaces forrelevant queries. Active nodes are able to initiate the group schema creation process; whichproduces a mediated schema representative of nodes with similar semantics. Groupschemas are then propagated in the overlay and used as a single interface for relevantqueries. This increases both the quality and the quantity of the retrieved answers and …,Information Systems,2008,8

The proposed mechanism includesan ECA rule language and a rule execution engine that transforms rules when they are firstposted; and then coordinates their execution. Like traditional ECA rules; our ECA rulelanguage has three parts: an event language; a condition language; and an actionlanguage. The event language provides a set of operators with a formal semantics for amultidatabase environment; and which allows a wide variety of composite events. Thecondition language provides Boolean algebra operators that take as operands eithercomposite or simple conditions. The action language provides a conjunction of simple orcomposite actions.

A framework for big data analytics,Verena Kantere; Maxim Filatov,Abstract Big Data may reside on multiple and dispersed sources and adhere to a variety offormats.

The users thatcreate such a process may have various roles; like; business analysts; engineers; end-usersetc. Each role may need or care for a different level of abstraction with respect to theexecution of the individual tasks and overall process. Therefore; it is necessary to enable theexpression of analytics tasks in an abstract manner; adaptable to the user role; interest andexpertise.

Peer data coordination through distributed triggers,Verena Kantere; Abdur Rahmani; Iluju Kiringa; Timos Sellis; John Mylopoulos,ABSTRACT This paper proposes a demonstration of data coordination in a peer datamanagement system through the employment of distributed triggers. The latter are used inorder to express in a declarative manner individual security and consistency requirements ofpeers; that cannot be ensured by default in the P2P environment. Peers achieve to handle ina transparent way data changes that come from local and remote actions and events. Thedistributed triggers are implemented as an extension of the active functionality of acentralized commercial DBMS. The language and execution semantics of distributedtriggers are integrated in the kernel of the DBMS such that the latter handles transparentlyand simultaneously both centralized and distributed triggers.

The Hyperion project addresses peer database coordinationthrough Event-Condition-Action (ECA) rules. However; peer databases are intended for non-technical end users; such as a receptionist at a doctor's office or an assistant pharmacist.Such users are not expected to know a technically demanding language for expressing ECArules that are appropriate for coordinating their respective databases. Accordingly; wepropose to offer a library of” standard” rules for coordinating two or more types of peerdatabases. These rules are defined in terms of assumed standard schemas for the peerdatabases they coordinate. Once two acquainted peers select such a rule; it can beinstantiated so that it can operate for their respective databases.

Elastic Resource Management with Adaptive State Space Partitioning of Markov Decision Processes,Konstantinos Lolos; Ioannis Konstantinou; Verena Kantere; Nectarios Koziris,Abstract: Modern large-scale computing deployments consist of complex applicationsrunning over machine clusters. An important issue in these is the offering of elasticity; ie; thedynamic allocation of resources to applications to meet fluctuating workload demands.Threshold based approaches are typically employed; yet they are difficult to configure andoptimize. Approaches based on reinforcement learning have been proposed; but theyrequire a large number of states in order to model complex application behavior. Methodsthat adaptively partition the state space have been proposed; but their partitioning criteriaand strategies are sub-optimal.

Query relaxation across heterogeneous data sources,Verena Kantere; George Orfanoudakis; Anastasios Kementsietsidis; Timos Sellis,Abstract The fundamental assumption for query rewriting in heterogeneous environments isthat the mappings used for the rewriting are complete; ie; every relation and attributementioned in the query is associated; through mappings; to relations and attributes in theschema of the source that the query is rewritten. In reality; it is rarely the case that suchcomplete sets of mappings exist between sources; and the presence of partial mappings isthe norm rather than the exception. So; practically; existing query answering algorithms failto generate any rewriting in the majority of cases. The question is then whether we cansomehow relax queries that cannot be rewritten as such (due to insufficient mappings); andwhether we can identify the interesting query relaxations; given the mappings at hand. In thispaper; we propose a technique to compute query relaxations of an input query that can …,Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2015,5

GrouPeer: A system for clustering PDMSs,Verena Kantere; Dimos Bousounis; Timos Sellis,ABSTRACT Sharing structured data in a PDMS is hard due to schema heterogeneity andpeer autonomy. To overcome heterogeneity; peer databases employ mappings that partiallymatch local information to that of their direct neighbors. Traditionally; a query is successivelyrewritten along the propagation path on each peer. This results in gradual querydegradation and the inability to retrieve data pertinent to the original version; even frompeers that store such data. This demonstration presents GrouPeer; a system that overcomesthe query degradation problem and enables the dynamic clustering of the overlay accordingto the semantics of the peer data; utilizing normal query traffic. Peers are provided with amethodology that allows them to choose which rewritten version of a query to answer anddiscover remote information-rich sources.

A tool for mapping discovery over revealing schemas,Verena Kantere; Dimos Bousounis; Timos Sellis,Abstract In a world of wide-scale information sharing; the decentralized coordination has toconsolidate a variety of heterogeneity. Shared data are described in different formats; ie datastructures; values and schemas. Querying manifold such sources entails techniques that canbridge the data formats. Some of these techniques deal with producing mappings for theschemas of data. The existing techniques view complementary aspects of the schemamapping problem. Important ones; consider producing all the possible mappings for a pair ofschemas; insinuating any accompanying semantics in the mappings and adapting correctmappings as schemas evolve. Towards this end we have developed a solution that is fine-tuned for the discovery of mappings as schemas of autonomous sources are graduallyrevealed.

Actually; thesites are aware of and can communicate with some other sites; according to the spatial datato which they are bound to. We are interested in routing queries about spatial data in suchoverlays; solely by exploiting local knowledge on sites; ie based on locality and directionalityin space. For such a system; we explore the parameters that can make search for any spatialinformation realizable and efficient. In this work we focus on the management of grid-partitioned space. In such a system there is a necessity for a mechanism that provides evenknowledge of space to each site of the overlay.

The latter express in a declarative mannerindividual security and consistency requirements of peers; that cannot be ensured by defaultin the P2P environment. Peers achieve to handle in a transparent way data changes thatcome from local and remote actions and events. The distributed triggers are implemented asan extension of the active functionality of a centralized commercial DBMS. The languageand execution semantics of distributed triggers are integrated in the kernel of the DBMSsuch that the latter handles transparently and simultaneously both centralized anddistributed triggers. Moreover; the management of distributed triggers is associated with aset of peer acquaintance and termination protocols which are incorporated in the …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2010,3
Semantic grouping of social networks in p2p database settings,Verena Kantere; Dimitrios Tsoumakos; Timos Sellis,Abstract Social network structures map network links to semantic relations betweenparticipants in order to assist in efficient resource discovery and information exchange. Inthis work; we propose a scheme that automates the process of creating schema synopsesfrom semantic clusters of peers which own autonomous relational databases. The resultingmediated schemas can be used as global interfaces for relevant queries. As ourexperimental evaluations show; this method increases both the quality and the quantity ofthe retrieved answers and allows for faster discovery of semantic groups by joining peers.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2007,3
Reusing classical query rewriting in P2P databases,Verena Kantere; Timos Sellis,Abstract Sharing of structured data in P2P overlays is a challenging problem; especially inthe absence of a global schema. The nature of structured data stored in the overlay enforcesstrict methods of querying. However; the intention of the user is usually to obtain informationthat is semantically relevant to the posed query and not information that strictly complies tostructural constraints. The rewriting mechanisms for structured data were initially developedfor tasks such as data integration and mediation; which by nature dictate strict consistency.In this work we propose ways of preprocessing a query in order to produce a version thatcan be rewritten in the classical way. We propose preprocessing guidelines that produce anew query that is most similar to the initially posed query. Accordingly; we discussthoroughly query similarity aspects from a structural point of view. Finally; we present an …,*,2007,3
Distributed triggers for peer data management,Verena Kantere; Iluju Kiringa; Qingqing Zhou; John Mylopoulos; Greg McArthur,Abstract A network of peer database management systems differs from conventionalmultidatabase systems by assuming absence of any central control; no global schema;transient connection of participating peer DBMSs; and evolving coordination amongdatabases. We describe distributed triggers to support data coordination in this setting. Theexecution of our triggers requires coordination among the involved peer databases. Wepresent an SQL3 compatible trigger language for the P2P setting. We also extend the SQL3processing mechanism to this setting. Our trigger processing mechanism consists of anexecution semantics; a set of termination protocols to deal with peer transiency; and a set ofprotocols for managing peer acquaintances in presence of distributed triggers. We showpreliminary experimental results about our mechanism.,OTM Confederated International Conferences" On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems",2006,3

Checkpoints for service level operations,Katerina Stamou; Verena Kantere; Jean Henry Morin; Antonella Longo; Mario Bochicchio,The paper introduces the checkpoint notion for the management of service level agreement(SLA) information within dataflow property graphs. The purpose of checkpoints in an SLAgraph database is to assist the automated handling of SLA resources with a flexible andexpressive data structure; such as a multi-relational graph. We use an abstract scenario ofcloud service provisioning for the analysis of the SLA and checkpoint graph data models.The paper integrates checkpoints into the graph schema by first establishing theirrelationships to internal SLA elements and to service management operations. In particular;the proposed graph data schema is used for the modeling and processing of a minimalservice level evaluation schema. Checkpoints perform data value comparisons and returnthe service level evaluation status of SLA guarantees at defined time intervals.

Sla information management through dependency digraphs: The case of cloud data services,Katerina Stamou; Verena Kantere; Jean-Henry Morin; Michael Georgiou,The paper addresses the issue of Service Level Agreement (SLA) data management for thecloud computing domain. We discuss the SLA anatomy and provide an analysis of SLA datamanagement requirements. The analysis highlights SLA data aspects considering theassociation of SLA terms with service management operations. Our work proposes a simple;structured way to store and manage SLA information through a digraph data model that ismodular; extensible and expressive with respect to data operational dependencies. Theproposed SLA digraph considers properties of SLA terms and service componentdependencies. We sketch a realistic data-service provisioning scenario; where the proposedSLA digraph is applied. We illustrate the mapping of data service attributes into SLA termsand the role of edge properties in the definition of service dependencies.,System Sciences (HICSS); 2014 47th Hawaii International Conference on,2014,2
Conceptual synopses of semantics in social networks sharing structured data,Verena Kantere; Maria-Eirini Politou; Timos Sellis,Abstract We are interested in the problem of data sharing in overlay networks that have asocial structure; ie participants are linked and exchange data with others wrt the similarity oftheir data semantics. In this paper we propose a methodology to produce conceptualsynopses for the semantics that are encapsulated in the schemas of relational data that areshared in a social network. These synopses are constructed solely based on semantics thatcan be deduced from schemas themselves with some optional additional conceptualclarifications. The produced synopses represent in a concentrated way the currentsemantics. Existing or new participants can refer to these synopses in order to determinetheir interest in the network. We present a methodology that employs the conceptualsynopsis for the construction of a mediating schema.

Cloud Resource Allocation from the User Perspective: A Bare-Bones Reinforcement Learning Approach,Alexandros Kontarinis; Verena Kantere; Nectarios Koziris,Abstract Cloud computing enables effortless access to a seemingly infinite shared pool ofresources; on a pay-per-use basis. As a result; a new challenge has emerged: designingcontrol mechanisms to precisely meet the actual workload requirements of cloudapplications in an online manner. To this end; a variety of complex resource managementissues have to be addressed; because workloads in the cloud are of a dynamic andheterogeneous nature; and traditional algorithms do not cope well within this context. In thiswork; we adopt the point of view of the user of a cloud infrastructure and focus on the task ofcontrolling leased resources. We formulate this task as a Reinforcement Learning problemand we simulate the decision-making process of a controller implementing the Q-learningalgorithm.

Query similarity for approximate query answering,Verena Kantere,Abstract Query rewriting in heterogeneous environments assumes mappings that arecomplete. In reality and especially in the Big Data era it is rarely the case that such completesets of mappings exist between sources; and the presence of partial mappings is the normrather than the exception. So; practically; existing rewriting algorithms fail in the majority ofcases. The solution is to approximate original queries with others that can be answered byexisting mappings. Approximate queries bear some similarity to original ones in terms ofstructure and semantics. In this paper we investigate the notion of such query similarity andwe introduce the use of query similarity functions to this end. We also present a methodologyfor the construction of such functions. We employ exemplary similarity functions created withthe proposed methodology into recent algorithms for approximate query answering and …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2016,1

Mapping discovery over revealing schemas,Verena Kantere; Dimos Bousounis; Timos Sellis,In a world of wide-scale information sharing; data are described in different formats; ie datastructures; values and schemas. Querying such sources entails techniques that can bridgethe data formats. Some existing techniques deal with schema mapping and viewcomplementary aspects of the problem. Important ones; consider producing all the possiblemappings for a pair of schemas; insinuating accompanying semantics in the mappings andadapting correct mappings as schemas evolve. In this work; we consider the problem ofdiscovering mappings as schemas of autonomous sources are gradually revealed. Using asan example setting an overlay of peer databases; we present a schema mapping solutionthat discovers correct mappings as peer schemas are gradually revealed to remote peers.Mapping discovery is schema-centric and incorporates new semantics as they are …,International Journal of Cooperative Information Systems,2015,1

Existing theories and techniques are notadequate to fulfil these requirements.

We propose to work towards modular data management; that will allow forunification of the expression of data management problems and systematization of theirsolution.

Towards Adaptive Analytics on Big Data Sources,Verena Kantere; Maxim Filatov,ABSTRACT The analysis of Big Data is a core and critical task in multifarious domains ofscience and industry. Such analysis needs to be performed on a range of data stores; bothtraditional and modern; on data sources that are heterogeneous in their schemas andformats; and on a diversity of query engines. The users that need to perform such dataanalysis may have several roles; like; business analysts; engineers; end-users etc.Therefore a system for Big Data analytics should enable the expression of analytics tasks inan abstract manner; adaptable to the user role; interest and expertise.

Approximate queries on big heterogeneous data,Verena Kantere,The fundamental assumption for query rewriting in heterogeneous environments is that themappings used for the rewriting are complete; ie; Every relation and attribute mentioned inthe query is associated; through mappings; to relations and attributes in the schema of thesource that the query is rewritten. In reality; it is rarely the case that such complete sets ofmappings exist between sources; and the presence of partial mappings is the norm ratherthan the exception. So; practically; existing query answering algorithms fail to generate anyrewriting in the majority of cases. This becomes an insurmountable problem in the new eraof Big Data; where we need query answers from various heterogeneous data sources. Thequestion is then whether we can somehow approximate queries that cannot be rewritten assuch (due to insufficient mappings); and whether we can identify the interesting query …,Big Data (BigData Congress); 2015 IEEE International Congress on,2015,1

Rethinking reinforcement learning for cloud elasticity,Konstantinos Lolos; Ioannis Konstantinou; Verena Kantere; Nectarios Koziris,Abstract Cloud elasticity; ie; the dynamic allocation of resources to applications to meetfluctuating workload demands; has been one of the greatest challenges in cloud computing.Approaches based on reinforcement learning have been proposed but they require a largenumber of states in order to model complex application behavior. In this work we propose anovel reinforcement learning approach that employs adaptive state space partitioning. Theidea is to start from one state that represents the entire environment and partition this intofiner-grained states adaptively to the observed workload and system behavior following adecision-tree approach. We explore novel statistical criteria and strategies that decide boththe correct parameters and the appropriate time to perform the partitioning.,Proceedings of the 2017 Symposium on Cloud Computing,2017,*
