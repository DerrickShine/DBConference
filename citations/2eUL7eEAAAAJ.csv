Discovering rules for water demand prediction: an enhanced rough-set approach,Aijun An; Ning Shan; Christine Chan; Nick Cercone; Wojciech Ziarko,Abstract Prediction of consumer demands is a pre-requisite for optimal control of waterdistribution systems because minimum-cost pumping schedules can be computed if waterdemands are accurately estimated. This paper presents an enhanced rough-sets method forgenerating prediction rules from a set of observed data. The proposed method extends uponthe standard rough set model by making use of the statistical information inherent in the datato handle incomplete and ambiguous training samples. It also discusses some experimentalresults from using this method for discovering knowledge on water demand prediction.,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,1996,250
ARSA: a sentiment-aware model for predicting sales performance using blogs,Yang Liu; Xiangji Huang; Aijun An; Xiaohui Yu,Abstract Due to its high popularity; Weblogs (or blogs in short) present a wealth ofinformation that can be very helpful in assessing the general public's sentiments andopinions. In this paper; we study the problem of mining sentiment information from blogs andinvestigate ways to use such information for predicting product sales performance. Based onan analysis of the complex nature of sentiments; we propose Sentiment PLSA (S-PLSA); inwhich a blog entry is viewed as a document generated by a number of hidden sentimentfactors. Training an S-PLSA model on the blog data enables us to obtain a succinctsummary of the sentiment information embedded in the blogs. We then present ARSA; anautoregressive sentiment-aware model; to utilize the sentiment information captured by S-PLSA for predicting product sales performance. Extensive experiments were conducted …,Proceedings of the 30th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2007,245
Modeling and predicting the helpfulness of online reviews,Yang Liu; Xiangji Huang; Aijun An; Xiaohui Yu,Online reviews provide a valuable resource for potential customers to make purchasedecisions. However; the sheer volume of available reviews as well as the large variations inthe review quality present a big impediment to the effective use of the reviews; as the mosthelpful reviews may be buried in the large amount of low quality reviews. The goal of thispaper is to develop models and algorithms for predicting the helpfulness of reviews; whichprovides the basis for discovering the most helpful reviews for given products. We first showthat the helpfulness of a review depends on three important factors: the reviewer's expertise;the writing style of the review; and the timeliness of the review. Based on the analysis ofthose factors; we present a nonlinear regression model for helpfulness prediction. Ourempirical study on the IMDB movie reviews dataset demonstrates that the proposed …,Data mining; 2008. ICDM'08. Eighth IEEE international conference on,2008,209
A roadmap of clustering algorithms: finding a match for a biomedical application,Bill Andreopoulos; Aijun An; Xiaogang Wang; Michael Schroeder,Abstract Clustering is ubiquitously applied in bioinformatics with hierarchical clustering andk-means partitioning being the most popular methods. Numerous improvements of these twoclustering methods have been introduced; as well as completely different approaches suchas grid-based; density-based and model-based clustering. For improved bioinformaticsanalysis of data; it is important to match clusterings to the requirements of a biomedicalapplication. In this article; we present a set of desirable clustering features that are used asevaluation criteria for clustering algorithms. We review 40 different clustering algorithms ofall approaches and datatypes. We compare algorithms on the basis of desirable clusteringfeatures; and outline algorithms' benefits and drawbacks as a basis for matching them tobiomedical applications.,Briefings in Bioinformatics,2009,183
Mining online reviews for predicting sales performance: A case study in the movie domain,Xiaohui Yu; Yang Liu; Xiangji Huang; Aijun An,Posting reviews online has become an increasingly popular way for people to expressopinions and sentiments toward the products bought or services received. Analyzing thelarge volume of online reviews available would produce useful actionable knowledge thatcould be of economic values to vendors and other interested parties. In this paper; weconduct a case study in the movie domain; and tackle the problem of mining reviews forpredicting product sales performance. Our analysis shows that both the sentimentsexpressed in the reviews and the quality of the reviews have a significant impact on thefuture sales performance of products in question. For the sentiment factor; we proposeSentiment PLSA (S-PLSA); in which a review is considered as a document generated by anumber of hidden sentiment factors; in order to capture the complex nature of sentiments …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data engineering,2012,140
Boosting prediction accuracy on imbalanced datasets with SVM ensembles,Yang Liu; Aijun An; Xiangji Huang,Abstract Learning from imbalanced datasets is inherently difficult due to lack of informationabout the minority class. In this paper; we study the performance of SVMs; which havegained great success in many real applications; in the imbalanced data context. Throughempirical analysis; we show that SVMs suffer from biased decision boundaries; and thattheir prediction performance drops dramatically when the data is highly skewed. Wepropose to combine an integrated sampling technique with an ensemble of SVMs to improvethe prediction performance. The integrated sampling technique combines both over-sampling and under-sampling techniques. Through empirical study; we show that ourmethod outperforms individual SVMs as well as several other state-of-the-art classifiers.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2006,128
Discovering top-k teams of experts with/without a leader in social networks,Mehdi Kargar; Aijun An,Abstract We study the problem of discovering a team of experts from a social network. Givena project whose completion requires a set of skills; our goal is to find a set of experts thattogether have all of the required skills and also have the minimal communication costamong them. We propose two communication cost functions designed for two types ofcommunication structures. We show that the problem of finding the team of experts thatminimizes one of the proposed cost functions is NP-hard. Thus; an approximation algorithmwith an approximation ratio of two is designed. We introduce the problem of finding a team ofexperts with a leader. The leader is responsible for monitoring and coordinating the project;and thus a different communication cost function is used in this problem. To solve thisproblem; an exact polynomial algorithm is proposed. We show that the total number of …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,113
Dynamic web log session identification with statistical language models,Xiangji Huang; Fuchun Peng; Aijun An; Dale Schuurmans,Abstract We present a novel session identification method based on statistical languagemodeling. Unlike standard timeout methods; which use fixed time thresholds for sessionidentification; we use an information theoretic approach that yields more robust results foridentifying session boundaries. We evaluate our new approach by learning interestingassociation rules from the segmented session files. We then compare the performance ofour approach to three standard session identification methods—the standard timeoutmethod; the reference length method; and the maximal forward reference method—and findthat our statistical language modeling approach generally yields superior results. However;as with every method; the performance of our technique varies with changing parametersettings. Therefore; we also analyze the influence of the two key factors in our language …,Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology,2004,102
Keyword search in graphs: Finding r-cliques,Mehdi Kargar; Aijun An,Abstract Keyword search over a graph finds a substructure of the graph containing all orsome of the input keywords. Most of previous methods in this area find connected minimaltrees that cover all the query keywords. Recently; it has been shown that finding subgraphsrather than trees can be more useful and informative for the users. However; the current treeor graph based methods may produce answers in which some content nodes (ie; nodes thatcontain input keywords) are not very close to each other. In addition; when searching foranswers; these methods may explore the whole graph rather than only the content nodes.This may lead to poor performance in execution time. To address the above problems; wepropose the problem of finding r-cliques in graphs. An r-clique is a group of content nodesthat cover all the input keywords and the distance between each two nodes is less than or …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2011,98
Rule quality measures for rule induction systems: Description and evaluation,Aijun An; Nick Cercone,Abstract A rule quality measure is important to a rule induction system for determining whento stop generalization or specialization. Such measures are also important to a rule-basedclassification procedure for resolving conflicts among rules. We describe a number ofstatistical and empirical rule quality formulas and present an experimental comparison ofthese formulas on a number of standard machine learning datasets. We also present a meta-learning method for generating a set of formula-behavior rules from the experimental resultswhich show the relationships between a formula's performance and the characteristics of adataset. These formula-behavior rules are combined into formula-selection rules that can beused in a rule induction system to select a rule quality formula before rule induction. We willreport the experimental results showing the effects of formula-selection on the predictive …,Computational Intelligence,2001,91
Combining integrated sampling with SVM ensembles for learning from imbalanced datasets,Yang Liu; Xiaohui Yu; Jimmy Xiangji Huang; Aijun An,Abstract Learning from imbalanced datasets is difficult. The insufficient information that isassociated with the minority class impedes making a clear understanding of the inherentstructure of the dataset. Most existing classification methods tend not to perform well onminority class examples when the dataset is extremely imbalanced; because they aim tooptimize the overall accuracy without considering the relative distribution of each class. Inthis paper; we study the performance of SVMs; which have gained great success in manyreal applications; in the imbalanced data context. Through empirical analysis; we show thatSVMs may suffer from biased decision boundaries; and that their prediction performancedrops dramatically when the data is highly skewed. We propose to combine an integratedsampling technique; which incorporates both over-sampling and under-sampling; with an …,Information processing & management,2011,89
Rule-induction and case-based reasoning: Hybrid architectures appear advantageous,Nick Cercone; Aijun An; Christine Chan,Researchers have embraced a variety of machine learning (ML) techniques in their efforts toimprove the quality of learning programs. The recent evolution of hybrid architectures formachine learning systems has resulted in several approaches that combine rule inductionmethods with case-based reasoning techniques to engender performance improvementsover more traditional single-representation architectures. We briefly survey several majorrule-induction and case-based reasoning ML systems. We then examine some interestinghybrid combinations of these systems and explain their strengths and weaknesses aslearning systems. We present a balanced approach to constructing a hybrid architecture;along with arguments in favor of this balance and mechanisms for achieving a properbalance. Finally; we present some initial empirical results from testing our ideas and draw …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1999,84
Unsupervised emotion detection from text using semantic and syntactic relations,Ameeta Agrawal; Aijun An,Abstract Emotion detection from text is a relatively new classification task. This paperproposes a novel unsupervised context-based approach to detecting emotion from text atthe sentence level. The proposed methodology does not depend on any existing manuallycrafted affect lexicons such as Word Net-Affect; thereby rendering our model flexible enoughto classify sentences beyond Ekman's model of six basic emotions. Our method computesan emotion vector for each potential affect bearing word based on the semantic relatednessbetween words and various emotion concepts. The scores are then fine tuned using thesyntactic dependencies within the sentence structure. Extensive evaluation on various datasets shows that our framework is a more generic and practical solution to the emotionclassification problem and yields significantly more accurate results than recent …,Proceedings of the The 2012 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conferences on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology-Volume 01,2012,70
Applying knowledge discovery to predict water-supply consumption,Aijun An; Christine Chan; Ning Shan; Nick Cercone; Wojciech Ziarko,Optimizing the control of operations in a municipal water distribution system can reduceelectricity costs and realize other economic benefits. However; optimal control requires theability to precisely predict short-term water demand so that minimum-cost pumpingschedules can be prepared. One of the objectives of our project to develop an intelligentsystem for monitoring and controlling municipal water-supply systems is to ensure optimalcontrol and reduce energy costs. Hence; prediction of water demand is essential. Wepresent an application of a rough-set approach for the automated discovery of rules from aset of data samples for daily water-demand predictions. The database contains 306 trainingsamples; covering information on seven environmental and sociological factors and theircorresponding daily volume of distribution flow. The rough-set method generates …,IEEE Expert,1997,69
Discretization of continuous attributes for learning classification rules,Aijun An; Nick Cercone,Abstract We present a comparison of three entropy-based discretization methods in acontext of learning classification rules. We compare the binary recursive discretization with astopping criterion based on the Minimum Description Length Principle (MDLP)[3]; a non-recursive method which simply chooses a number of cut-points with the highest entropygains; and a non-recursive method that selects cut-points according to both informationentropy and distribution of potential cut-points over the instance space.

Detection of malicious and non-malicious website visitors using unsupervised neural network learning,Dusan Stevanovic; Natalija Vlajic; Aijun An,Abstract Distributed denials of service (DDoS) attacks are recognized as one of the mostdamaging attacks on the Internet security today. Recently; malicious web crawlers havebeen used to execute automated DDoS attacks on web sites across the WWW. In this study;we examine the use of two unsupervised neural network (NN) learning algorithms for thepurpose web-log analysis: the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Modified AdaptiveResonance Theory 2 (Modified ART2). In particular; through the use of SOM and modifiedART2; our work aims to obtain a better insight into the types and distribution of visitors to apublic web-site based on their browsing behavior; as well as to investigate the relativedifferences and/or similarities between malicious web crawlers and other non-maliciousvisitor groups.

ELEM2: A learning system for more accurate classifications,Aijun An; Nick Cercone,Abstract We present ELEM2; a new method for inducing classification rules from a set ofexamples. The method employs several new strategies in the induction and classificationprocesses to improve the predictive performance of induced rules. In particular; a newheuristic function for evaluating attribute-value pairs is proposed. The function is defined toreflect the degree of relevance of an attribute-value pair to a target concept and leads toselection of the most relevant pairs for formulating rules. Another feature of ELEM2 is that ithandles inconsistent training data by defining an unlearnable region of a concept based onthe probability distribution of that concept in the training data. To further deal with imperfectdata; ELEM2 makes use of the post-pruning technique to remove unreliable portions of agenerated rule. A new rule quality measure is proposed for the purpose of post-pruning …,Conference of the Canadian Society for Computational Studies of Intelligence,1998,60
Efficient bi-objective team formation in social networks,Mehdi Kargar; Aijun An; Morteza Zihayat,Abstract We tackle the problem of finding a team of experts from a social network tocomplete a project that requires a set of skills. The social network is modeled as a graph. Anode in the graph represents an expert and has a weight representing the monetary cost forusing the expert service. Two nodes in the graph can be connected and the weight on theedge represents the communication cost between the two corresponding experts. Given aproject; our objective is to find a team of experts that covers all the required skills and alsominimizes the communication cost as well as the personnel cost of the project. To minimizeboth of the objectives; we define a new combined cost function which is based on the linearcombination of the objectives (ie communication and personnel costs). We show that theproblem of minimizing the combined cost function is an NP-hard problem. Thus; one …,Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,2012,56

Mining top-k high utility patterns over data streams,Morteza Zihayat; Aijun An,Abstract Online high utility itemset mining over data streams has been studied recently.However; the existing methods are not designed for producing top-k patterns. Since therecould be a large number of high utility patterns; finding only top-k patterns is more attractivethan producing all the patterns whose utility is above a threshold. A challenge with findingtop-k high utility itemsets over data streams is that it is not easy for users to determine aproper minimum utility threshold in order for the method to work efficiently. In this paper; wepropose a new method (named T-HUDS) for finding top-k high utility patterns over slidingwindows of a data stream. The method is based on a compressed tree structure; calledHUDS-tree; that can be used to efficiently find potential top-k high utility itemsets over slidingwindows. T-HUDS uses a new utility estimation model to more effectively prune the …,Information Sciences,2014,44

The data mining results areused to expand query terms and to re-estimate some of the parameters used in aprobabilistic weighting function. We evaluate the data mining based feedback method on theTREC HARD data set. The results show that data mining can be successfully applied toimprove the text retrieval performance.

Recently; malicious web crawlers have been used to executeautomated DDoS attacks on web sites across the WWW. In this study we examine the effectof applying seven well-established data mining classification algorithms on static web serveraccess logs in order to:(1) classify user sessions as belonging to either automated webcrawlers or human visitors and (2) identify which of the automated web crawlers sessionsexhibit 'malicious' behavior and are potentially participants in a DDoS attack.

The usage of the Livelink software has been recorded by theLivelink Web server in its log files. We present an application of data mining techniques tothe Livelink Web usage data. In particular; we focus on how to find interesting associationrules and sequential patterns from the Livelink log files. A number of interestingnessmeasures are used in our application to identify interesting rules and patterns. We present acomparison of these measures based on the feedback from domain experts. Some of theinterestingness measures are found to be better than others.,Proceedings of the eleventh international conference on Information and knowledge management,2002,41
Learning classification rules from data,Aijun An,Abstract We present ELEM2; a machine learning system that induces classification rulesfrom a set of data based on a heuristic search over a hypothesis space. ELEM2 isdistinguished from other rule induction systems in three aspects. First; it uses a newheuristtic function to guide the heuristic search. The function reflects the degree of relevanceof an attribute-value pair to a target concept and leads to selection of the most relevant pairsfor formulating rules. Second; ELEM2 handles inconsistent training examples by defining anunlearnable region of a concept based on the probability distribution of that concept in thetraining data. The unlearnable region is used as a stopping criterion for the concept learningprocess; which resolves conflicts without removing inconsistent examples. Third; ELEM2employs a new rule quality measure in its post-pruning process to prevent rules from …,Computers & Mathematics with Applications,2003,40

Clustering by common friends finds locally significant proteins mediating modules,Bill Andreopoulos; Aijun An; Xiaogang Wang; Michalis Faloutsos; Michael Schroeder,Abstract Motivation: Much research has been dedicated to large-scale protein interactionnetworks including the analysis of scale-free topologies; network modules and the relation ofdomain–domain to protein–protein interaction networks. Identifying locally significantproteins that mediate the function of modules is still an open problem. Method: We use alayered clustering algorithm for interaction networks; which groups proteins by the similarityof their direct neighborhoods. We identify locally significant proteins; called mediators; whichlink different clusters. We apply the algorithm to a yeast network. Results: Clusters andmediators are organized in hierarchies; where clusters are mediated by and act asmediators for other clusters.

Objective and Subjective Algorithms for Grouping Association Rules.,Aijun An; Shakil M Khan; Xiangji Huang,Abstract We propose two algorithms for grouping and summarizing association rules. Thefirst algorithm recursively groups rules according to the structure of the rules and generatesa tree of clusters as a result. The second algorithm groups the rules according to thesemantic distance between the rules by making use of an autometically tagged semantictree-structured network of items. We provide a case study in which the proposed algorithmsare evaluated. The results show that our grouping methods are effective and produce goodgrouping results.,ICDM,2003,34
From computational intelligence to web intelligence,Nick Cercone; Lijun Hou; Vlado Keselj; Aijun An; Kanlaya Naruedomkul; Xiaohua Hu,The authors explore three topics in computational intelligence: machine translation; machinelearning and user interface design and speculate on their effects on Web intelligence.Systems that can communicate naturally and learn from interactions will power Webintelligence's long term success. The large number of problems requiring Web-specificsolutions demand a sustained and complementary effort to advance fundamental machine-learning research and incorporate a learning component into every Internet interaction.Traditional forms of machine translation either translate poorly; require resources that growexponentially with the number of languages translated; or simplify language excessively.Recent success in statistical; nonlinguistic; and hybrid machine translation suggests thatsystems based on these technologies can achieve better results with a large annotated …,Computer,2002,34
Clustering large software systems at multiple layers,Bill Andreopoulos; Aijun An; Vassilios Tzerpos; Xiaogang Wang,Abstract Software clustering algorithms presented in the literature rarely incorporate in theclustering process dynamic information; such as the number of function invocations duringruntime. Moreover; the structure of a software system is often multi-layered; while existingclustering algorithms often create flat system decompositions. This paper presents asoftware clustering algorithm called MULICsoft that incorporates in the clustering processboth static and dynamic information. MULICsoft produces layered clusters with the coreelements of each cluster assigned to the top layer. We present experimental results ofapplying MULICsoft to a large open-source system. Comparison with existing softwareclustering algorithms indicates that MULICsoft is able to produce decompositions that areclose to those created by system experts.,Information and Software Technology,2007,32
Finding affordable and collaborative teams from a network of experts,Mehdi Kargar; Morteza Zihayat; Aijun An,Abstract Given an expert network; we tackle the problem of finding a team of experts thatcovers a set of required skills and also minimizes the communication cost as well as thepersonnel cost of the team. Since two costs need to be minimized; this is a bicriteriaoptimization problem. We show that the problem of minimizing these objectives is NP-hard.We use two approaches to solve this bicriteria optimization problem. In the first approach; wepropose several (α; β)-approximation algorithms that receive a budget on one objective andminimizes the other objective within the budget with guaranteed performance bounds. In thesecond approach; an approximation algorithm is proposed to find a set of Pareto-optimalteams; in which each team is not dominated by other feasible teams in terms of thepersonnel and communication costs. The proposed approximation algorithms have …,*,2013,31

An efficient approach to mining indirect associations,Qian Wan; Aijun An,Abstract Discovering association rules is one of the important tasks in data mining. Whilemost of the existing algorithms are developed for efficient mining of frequent patterns; it hasbeen noted recently that some of the infrequent patterns; such as indirect associations;provide useful insight into the data. In this paper; we propose an efficient algorithm; called HI-mine; based on a new data structure; called HI-struct; for mining the complete set of indirectassociations between items. Our experimental results show that HI-mine's performance issignificantly better than that of the previously developed algorithm for mining indirectassociations on both synthetic and real world data sets over practical ranges of supportspecifications.,Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,2006,27

Using user access patterns for semantic query caching,Qingsong Yao; Aijun An,Abstract In this paper; we propose a solution that partly solves the selection andreplacement problems for semantic query caching. We believe that the queries submitted bya client are not random. They have certain meaning and may follow certain rules. We useuser access graphs to represent the query execution orders and propose algorithms that usesuch information for semantic query caching. Unlike the previous approaches; oursanticipates incoming queries based on the queries that have been submitted; analyzes thesemantic relationship between them; and rewrites and caches the current query to answermultiple queries. Our initial experimental result shows that our solution improves cacheperformance.,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2003,24
Riding the tide of sentiment change: sentiment analysis with evolving online reviews,Yang Liu; Xiaohui Yu; Aijun An; Xiangji Huang,Abstract The last decade has seen a rapid growth in the volume of online reviews. A greatdeal of research has been done in the area of opinion mining; aiming at analyzing thesentiments expressed in those reviews towards products and services. Most of the suchwork focuses on mining opinions from a collection of reviews posted during a particularperiod; and does not consider the change in sentiments when the collection of reviewsevolve over time. In this paper; we fill in this gap; and study the problem of developingadaptive sentiment analysis models for online reviews. Given the success of latent semanticmodeling techniques; we propose two adaptive methods to capture the evolving sentiments.As a case study; we also investigate the possibility of using the extracted adaptive patternsfor sales prediction.

Hierarchical density-based clustering of categorical data and a simplification,Bill Andreopoulos; Aijun An; Xiaogang Wang,Abstract A challenge involved in applying density-based clustering to categorical datasets isthat the 'cube'of attribute values has no ordering defined. We propose the HIERDENCalgorithm for hierarchical density-based clustering of categorical data. HIERDENC offers abasis for designing simpler clustering algorithms that balance the tradeoff of accuracy andspeed. The characteristics of HIERDENC include:(i) it builds a hierarchy representing theunderlying cluster structure of the categorical dataset;(ii) it minimizes the user-specified inputparameters;(iii) it is insensitive to the order of object input;(iv) it can handle outliers. Weevaluate HIERDENC on small-dimensional standard categorical datasets; on which itproduces more accurate results than other algorithms. We present a faster simplification ofHIERDENC called the MULIC algorithm. MULIC performs better than subspace clustering …,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2007,23

Bi-level clustering of mixed categorical and numerical biomedical data,Bill Andreopoulos; Aijun An; Xiaogang Wang,Biomedical data sets often have mixed categorical and numerical types; where the formerrepresent semantic information on the objects and the latter represent experimental results.We present the BILCOM algorithm for'Bi-Level Clustering of Mixed categorical andnumerical data types'. BILCOM performs a pseudo-Bayesian process; where the prior iscategorical clustering. BILCOM partitions biomedical data sets of mixed types; such ashepatitis; thyroid disease and yeast gene expression data with Gene Ontology annotations;more accurately than if using one type alone.,International Journal of Data Mining and Bioinformatics,2006,23
Representing UML snowflake diagram from integrating XML data using XML schema,Yu Li; Aijun An,We present a UML conceptual-level integration framework for supporting OLAP operationson diverse XML data sources. Our integration framework takes advantage of the constructsand relationships existing within XML schemas. Two processes are involved in ourintegration framework. The first one is to convert XML schemas into UML class diagrams.The second is to build a multidimensional model from the UML class diagrams. This paperfocuses on the issues in the second process. We describe how to represent amultidimensional model using a UML snowflake diagram and how to represent the UMLsnow/lake diagram using XML schemas. Our advanced XML schema-based representationof a multidimensional model is used as metadata in our prototype system for processingOLAP queries. It elegantly holds the information within a UML snowflake diagram such as …,Data Engineering Issues in E-Commerce; 2005. Proceedings. International Workshop on,2005,23
Unsupervised clustering of Web sessions to detect malicious and non-malicious website users,Dusan Stevanovic; Natalija Vlajic; Aijun An,Abstract Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are recognized as one of the most damagingattacks on the Internet security today. Recently; malicious web crawlers have been used toexecute automated DoS attacks on web sites across the WWW. In this study; we examine theuse of two unsupervised neural network (NN) learning algorithms for the purpose web-loganalysis: the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Modified Adaptive Resonance Theory 2(Modified ART2). In particular; through the use of SOM and Modified ART2; our work aims toobtain a better insight into the types and distribution of visitors to a public web-site based ontheir link-traversal behaviour; as well as to investigate the relative differences and/orsimilarities between malicious web crawlers and other non-malicious visitor groups.

A quality-aware model for sales prediction using reviews,Xiaohui Yu; Yang Liu; Xiangji Huang; Aijun An,Abstract Writing and publishing reviews online has become an increasingly popular way forpeople to express opinions and sentiments. Analyzing the large volume of online reviewsavailable can produce useful knowledge that are of interest to vendors and other parties.Prior studies in the literature have shown that online reviews have a significant correlationwith the sales of products; and therefore mining the reviews could help predict the salesperformance of relevant products. However; those studies fail to consider one importantfactor that may significantly affect the accuracy of the prediction; ie; the quality of the reviews.In this paper; we propose a regression model that explicitly takes into account the qualityfactor; and discusses how this quality information can be predicted when it is not readilyavailable. Experimental results on a movie review dataset confirm the effectiveness of the …,Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web,2010,22
Personalized recommendation with adaptive mixture of markov models,Yang Liu; Xiangji Huang; Aijun An,Abstract With more and more information available on the Internet; the task of makingpersonalized recommendations to assist the user's navigation has become increasinglyimportant. Considering there might be millions of users with different backgrounds accessinga Web site everyday; it is infeasible to build a separate recommendation system for eachuser. To address this problem; clustering techniques can first be employed to discover usergroups. Then; user navigation patterns for each group can be discovered; to allow theadaptation of a Web site to the interest of each individual group. In this paper; we propose tomodel user access sequences as stochastic processes; and a mixture of Markov modelsbased approach is taken to cluster users and to capture the sequential relationshipsinherent in user access histories. Several important issues that arise in constructing the …,Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology,2007,21
Efficient mining of indirect associations using hi-mine,Qian Wan; Aijun An,Abstract Discovering association rules is one of the important tasks in data mining. Whilemost of the existing algorithms are developed for efficient mining of frequent patterns; it hasbeen noted recently that some of the infrequent patterns; such as indirect associations;provide useful insight into the data. In this paper; we propose an efficient algorithm; called HI-mine; based on a new data structure; called HI-struct; for mining the complete set of indirectassociations between items. Our experimental results show that HI-mine's performance issignificantly better than that of the previously developed algorithm for mining indirectassociations on both synthetic and real world data sets over practical ranges of supportspecifications.,Conference of the Canadian Society for Computational Studies of Intelligence,2003,21
Rule quality measures improve the accuracy of rule induction: an experimental approach,Aijun An; Nick Cercone,Abstract Rule quality measures can help to determine when to stop ge-neralization orspecification of rules in a rule induction system. Rule quality measures can also help toresolve conflicts among rules in a rule classification system. We enlarge our previous set ofstatistical and empirical rule quality formulas which we tested earlier on a number ofstandard machine learning data sets. We describe this new set of formulas; performingextensive tests which also go beyond our earlier tests; to compare these formulas. We alsospecify how to generate formula-behavior ru-les from our experimental results; which showthe relationships between a formula's performance and the characteristics of a dataset.Formula-behavior rules can be combined into formula-selection rules which can select arule quality formula before rule induction takes place. We report the experimental results …,International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems,2000,21
Mulic: Multi-layer increasing coherence clustering of categorical data sets,Bill Andreopoulos; Aijun An; Xiaogang Wang,ABSTRACT We present the MULIC algorithm for clustering of categorical data sets thatoffers major improvements over many aspects of the traditional k-Modes algorithm; so thatthe results are more accurate. A preprocessing of the objects in the data set is performed;that imposes an ordering of the objects. MULIC does not sacriﬁce the coherence of theresulting clusters for the number of clusters desired. Instead; it produces as many clusters asthere seem to naturally exist in the data set. Each cluster consists of layers formed graduallythrough iterations; by reducing the similarity criterion for inserting objects in layers of acluster at different iterations. We show that the misclassiﬁcation rates—including HA Indexes[16]-of MULIC are much lower than those of other algorithms; including k-Modes [14]; ROCK[10]; AutoClass [19] and the WEKA clustering algorithms [18; 20]. We compare the MULIC …,Technical Report CS,2004,20
CViz: an interactive visualization system for rule induction,Jianchao Han; Aijun An; Nick Cercone,Abstract We introduce an interactive visualization system; CViz; for rule induction. Theprocess of learning classification rules is visualized; which consists of five components:preparing and visualizing the original data; cleaning the original data; discretizing numericalattributes; learning classification rules; and visualizing the discovered rules. The CVizsystem is presented and each component is discussed. Three approaches for discretizingnumerical attributes; including equal-length; equal-depth; and entropy-based approaches;are provided.

Discovering transitional patterns and their significant milestones in transaction databases,Qian Wan; Aijun An,A transaction database usually consists of a set of time-stamped transactions. Miningfrequent patterns in transaction databases has been studied extensively in data miningresearch. However; most of the existing frequent pattern mining algorithms (such as Aprioriand FP-growth) do not consider the time stamps associated with the transactions. In thispaper; we extend the existing frequent pattern mining framework to take into account thetime stamp of each transaction and discover patterns whose frequency dramatically changesover time. We define a new type of patterns; called transitional patterns; to capture thedynamic behavior of frequent patterns in a transaction database. Transitional patternsinclude both positive and negative transitional patterns. Their frequenciesincrease/decrease dramatically at some time points of a transaction database.

Discovering rules from data for water demand prediction,Aijun An; Ning Shan; Christine Chan; Nick Cercone; Wojciech Ziarko,Abstract Prediction of consumer demands is a pre-requisite for optimal control of waterdistribution systems. In this paper; we present a rough set method for generating predictionrules from a set of observed data. The proposed method is based on an extension of thestandard rough set model. The salient feature of this method is that it makes use of thestatistical information inherent in the data to handle incomplete and ambiguous trainingsamples. Experimental results from using this method for water demand prediction aregiven.,Proceedings of the workshop on machine learning in engineering IJCAI,1995,18
Classification methods,Sibanjan Das,Like all supervised methods; classification techniques also require targets with prelabeled classesfor training the classifier. For example; if we want to design a classifier for predicting customerchurn; then we need past historical data with an indicator to annotate whether the customer churnedin the past or not. The classifier for this particular use case can be termed as a “binary”classifier; as it has just two class labels: that is; churned or not churned. When there are morethan two class labels; a “multinomial” classifier is used. For example; the quality of a productcan be on target; within limits; or above limits. In such cases; we need to prepare a classifierthat can identify multiclass targets. However; all classifier algorithms are not one-size-fits-alltype. For instance; a binary logistic regression cannot be used for classifying multiclasstargets. A multinomial logistic regression can be used; but there other classification …,*,2016,17
HelpMeter: a nonlinear model for predicting the helpfulness of online reviews,Yang Liu; Xiangji Huang; Aijun An; Xiaohui Yu,With the flourish of the Internet; online review mining has attracted a lot of attention from theresearch community. However; compared to various well-studied sentiment analysis andopinion summarization problems; less effort has been made to analyze the quality of onlinereviews. The objective of this paper is to fill in this gap by automatically evaluating the"helpfulness" of reviews and consequently developing novel models to identify the mosthelpful reviews for a particular product. In particular; based on a thorough analysis of variousfactors that may affect the review quality; we propose HelpMeter; a nonlinear regressionmodel for helpfulness prediction. Some preliminary experiments were conducted on a moviereview data set; and the performance results confirm the superiority of the proposed method.,Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology; 2008.

A case study for learning from imbalanced data sets,Aijun An; Nick Cercone; Xiangji Huang,Abstract We present our experience in applying a rule induction technique to an extremelyimbalanced pharmaceutical data set. We focus on using a variety of performance measuresto evaluate a number of rule quality measures. We also investigate whether simply changingthe distribution skew in the training data can improve predictive performance. Finally; wepropose a method for adjusting the learning algorithm for learning in an extremelyimbalanced environment. Our experimental results show that this adjustment improvespredictive performance for rule quality formulas in which rule coverage makes positivecontributions to the rule quality value.,Conference of the Canadian Society for Computational Studies of Intelligence,2001,17
Integrating rule induction and case-based reasoning to enhance problem solving,Aijun An; Nick Cercone; Christine Chan,Abstract We present a new method that integrates rule induction and case-based reasoning.The method is new in two aspects. First; it applies a novel feature weighting function forassessing similarities between cases. By using this weighting function; optimal case retrievalis achieved in that the most relevant cases can be retrieved from the case base. Second; themethod handles both classification and numeric prediction tasks under a mixed paradigm ofrule-based and case-based reasoning. Before problem solving; rule induction is performedto induce a set of decision rules from a set of training data. The rules are then employed todetermine some parameters in the new weighting function. The induced rules are also usedto detect possible noise in the training set so that noisy cases are not used in case-basedreasoning. For classification tasks; rules are applied to make decisions; if there is a …,International Conference on Case-Based Reasoning,1997,17

Characterizing database user’s access patterns,Qingsong Yao; Aijun An,Abstract Much work has been done on characterizing the workload of a database system.Previous studies focused on providing different types of statistical summaries; and modelingthe run-time behavior on the physical resource level. In this paper; we focus oncharacterizing the database system's workload from the view of database users. We useuser access patterns to describe how a client application or a group of users accesses thedata of a database system. The user access patterns include a set of user access events thatrepresent the format of the queries and a set of user access graphs that represent the queryexecution orders. User access patterns can help database administrators tune the system;help database users optimize queries; and help to predict and cache future queries. In thispaper; we present several approaches to using user access patterns to improve system …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2004,16

These formula-behavior rules are combined intoformula-selection rules which can be used in a rule induction system to select a rule qualityformula before rule induction.,International Workshop on Rough Sets; Fuzzy Sets; Data Mining; and Granular-Soft Computing,1999,15
Detecting web crawlers from web server access logs with data mining classifiers,Dusan Stevanovic; Aijun An; Natalija Vlajic,Abstract In this study; we introduce two novel features: the consecutive sequential requestratio and standard deviation of page request depth; for improving the accuracy of maliciousand non-malicious web crawler classification from static web server access logs withtraditional data mining classifiers. In the first experiment we evaluate the new features on theclassification of known well-behaved web crawlers and human visitors. In the secondexperiment we evaluate the new features on the classification of malicious web crawlers;unknown visitors; well-behaved crawlers and human visitors. The classification performanceis evaluated in terms of classification accuracy; and F 1 score. The experimental resultsdemonstrate the potential of the two new features to improve the accuracy of data miningclassifiers in identifying malicious and well-behaved web crawler sessions.,International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems,2011,14
Session boundary detection for association rule learning using n-gram language models,Xiangji Huang; Fuchun Peng; Aijun An; Dale Schuurmans; Nick Cercone,Abstract We present a statistical method using n-gram language models to identify sessionboundaries in a large collection of Livelink log data. The identified sessions are then usedfor association rule learning. Unlike the traditional ad hoc timeout method; which uses fixedtime thresholds for session identification; our method uses an information theoretic approachthat provides a natural technique for performing dynamic session identification. Theeffectiveness of our approach is evaluated with respect to 4 different interestingnessmeasures. We find that we obtain a significant improvement in each interestingnessmeasure; ranging from a 26. 6% to 39% improvement on average over the best resultsobtained with standard timeout methods.,Conference of the Canadian Society for Computational Studies of Intelligence,2003,14
MeanKS: Meaningful keyword search in relational databases with complex schema,Mehdi Kargar; Aijun An; Nick Cercone; Parke Godfrey; Jaroslaw Szlichta; Xiaohui Yu,Abstract Keyword search in relational databases was introduced in the last decade to assistusers who are not familiar with a query language; the schema of the database; or the contentof the data. An answer is a join tree of tuples that contains the query keywords. Whensearching a database with a complex schema; there are potentially many answers to thequery. Therefore; ranking answers based on their relevance is crucial in this context. Priorwork has addressed relevance based on the size of the answer or the IR scores of thetuples. However; this is not sufficient when searching a complex schema. We demonstrateMeanKS; a new system for meaningful keyword search over relational databases. Thesystem first captures the user's interest by determining the roles of the keywords. Then; ituses schema-based ranking to rank join trees that cover the keyword roles. This uses the …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,13
Clustering the internet topology at multiple layers,Bill Andreopoulos; Aijun An; Xiaogang Wang,Abstract: Clustering algorithms presented in the literature are rarely designed for the layeredstructure of the Internet topology and its unknown number of clusters. A recent approach inthe research community is to collect IP path data and to map the IPs to known AutonomousSystems (ASs) forming the Internet backbones; resulting in large data sets of AS links.Clustering data sets of AS links permits inferring business relationships between ASs. Wepropose the MULICsoft algorithm for this purpose. MULICsoft clusters categorical data setswhere the objects to be clustered are ASs and each categorical attribute value (CA)represents a link between ASs. Each CA has a 'weight'in the range of 0.0 to 1.0; that isinversely related to the number of unknown ASs in a link between ASs. MULICsoft producesas many clusters as it can find in the data set and each cluster consists of layers. The …,WSEAS Transactions on Information Science and Applications,2005,13
Evaluation and automatic selection of methods for handling missing data,Ying Zou; Aijun An; Xiangji Huang,Real-world data often contain missing values. In this paper; nine different methods forhandling missing data are described and compared. Thirty real-world datasets are used asinput data in our experiment. Nine different missing levels are implemented in each trainingdata set to investigate the performance of the methods at different missing levels. Forevaluation; two different classification techniques; C4. 5 and ELEM2; are applied to obtainthe classification error rates. The experimental results show that different methods can havedifferent effects on a data set. Based on the experimental results; we also propose a meta-learning approach to selecting a method for handling missing data. The evaluation resultsshow that the meta-learning approach is effective in selecting a suitable method for handlingmissing data.,Granular Computing; 2005 IEEE International Conference on,2005,12
Mining high utility sequential patterns from evolving data streams,Morteza Zihayat; Cheng-Wei Wu; Aijun An; Vincent S Tseng,Abstract In this paper; we define the problem of mining high utility sequential patterns(HUSPs) over high-velocity streaming data and propose an efficient algorithm for miningHUSPs over a data stream. The main challenges we tackle include how to maintain acompact summary of the data stream to reflect the evolution of sequence utilities over timeand how to overcome the problem of combinatorial explosion of a search space. Wepropose a compact data structure named HUSP-Tree to maintain the essential informationfor mining HUSPs in an online fashion. An efficient and single-pass algorithm named HUSP-Stream is proposed to generate HUSPs from HUSP-Tree. HUSP-Stream uses a new utilityestimation model to more effectively prune the search space.

BILCOM: Bi-level Clustering of Mixed Categorical and Numerical Biological Data,Bill Andreopoulos; Aijun An; Xiaogang Wang,Abstract. Data sets emerging from biomedical domains often have mixed categorical andnumerical types; where the categorical type represents semantic information on the objects;while the numerical represents experimental results. We present the BILCOM algorithm for“Bi-Level Clustering of Mixed data types”. BILCOM clusters data sets of objects that havenumerical attribute values; while incorporating categorical attribute values. This clusteringalgorithm performs a pseudo-Bayesian process; where the prior is categorical clustering andthe posterior is numerical clustering. This algorithm provides a different type of insight forbiomedical data sets by giving their 'full picture'. We compare BILCOM with traditionalclustering algorithms applied to biomedical data sets of mixed types; including yeast;hepatitis and thyroid disease.

Meaningful keyword search in relational databases with large and complex schema,Mehdi Kargar; Aijun An; Nick Cercone; Parke Godfrey; Jaroslaw Szlichta; Xiaohui Yu,Keyword search over relational databases offers an alternative way to SQL to query andexplore databases that is effective for lay users who may not be well versed in SQL or thedatabase schema. This becomes more pertinent for databases with large and complexschemas. An answer in this context is a join tree spanning tuples containing the query'skeywords. As there are potentially many answers to the query; and the user is often onlyinterested in seeing the top-k answers; how to rank the answers based on their relevance isof paramount importance. We focus on the relevance of join as the fundamental means torank answers. We devise means to measure relevance of relations and foreign keys in theschema over the information content of the database. This can be done offline with no needfor external models.

Cross-lingual word sense disambiguation for languages with scarce resources,Bahareh Sarrafzadeh; Nikolay Yakovets; Nick Cercone; Aijun An,Abstract Word Sense Disambiguation has long been a central problem in computationallinguistics. Word Sense Disambiguation is the ability to identify the meaning of words incontext in a computational manner. Statistical and supervised approaches require a largeamount of labeled resources as training datasets. In contradistinction to English; the Persianlanguage has neither any semantically tagged corpus to aid machine learning approachesfor Persian texts; nor any suitable parallel corpora. Yet due to the ever-increasingdevelopment of Persian pages in Wikipedia; this resource can act as a comparable corpusfor English-Persian texts. In this paper; we propose a cross-lingual approach to tagging theword senses in Persian texts.

Clustering mixed numerical and low quality categorical data: significance metrics on a yeast example,Bill Andreopoulos; Aijun An; Xiaogang Wang,Abstract We present the M-BILCOM algorithm for clustering mixed numerical and categoricaldata sets; in which the categorical attribute values (CAs) are not certain to be correct andhave associated confidence values (CVs) from 0.0 to 1.0 to represent their certainty ofcorrectness. M-BILCOM performs bi-level clustering of mixed data sets resembling aBayesian process. We have applied M-BILCOM to yeast data sets in which the CAs wereperturbed randomly and CVs were assigned indicating the confidence of correctness of theCAs. On such mixed data sets M-BILCOM outperforms other clustering algorithms; such asAutoClass. We have applied M-BILCOM to real numerical data sets from gene expressionstudies on yeast; incorporating CAs representing Gene Ontology annotations on the genesand CVs representing Gene Ontology Evidence Codes on the CAs.

Efficient top-k keyword search in graphs with polynomial delay,Mehdi Kargar; Aijun An,A system for efficient keyword search in graphs is demonstrated. The system has twocomponents; a search through only the nodes containing the input keywords for a set ofnodes that are close to each other and together cover the input keywords and an explorationfor finding how these nodes are related to each other. The system generates all or top-kanswers in polynomial delay. Answers are presented to the user according to a rankingcriterion so that the answers with nodes closer to each other are presented before the oneswith nodes farther away from each other. In addition; the set of answers produced by oursystem is duplication free. The system uses two methods for presenting the final answer tothe user.

An adaptive model for probabilistic sentiment analysis,Xiaohui Yu; Yang Liu; Aijun An,Online reviews; which are getting increasingly prevalent with the rapid growth of Web 2.0;have been shown to be second only to``word-of-mouth''in terms of influencing purchasedecisions. It is therefore imperative to analyze them and distill useful knowledge that couldbe of economic values to vendors and other interested parties. Previous studies haveconfirmed that the sentiments expressed in the online reviews are strongly correlated withthe sales performance of products. In particular; a model called ARSA has been proposedfor predicting sales performance using a model called S-PLSA. In this paper; we build uponthat work; and present an adaptive sentiment analysis model called S-PLSA+; which notonly can capture the hidden sentiment factors in the reviews; but has the capability to beincrementally updated as more data become available.

Compact transaction database for efficient frequent pattern mining,Qian Wan; Aijun An,Mining frequent patterns is one of the fundamental and essential operations in many datamining applications; such as discovering association rules. In this paper; we propose aninnovative approach to generating compact transaction databases for efficient frequentpattern mining. It uses a compact tree structure; called CT-tree; to compress the originaltransactional data. This allows the CT-a priori algorithm; which is revised from the classical apriori algorithm; to generate frequent patterns quickly by skipping the initial database scanand reducing a great amount of I/O time per database scan. Empirical evaluations show thatour approach is effective; efficient and promising; while the storage space requirement aswell as the mining time can be decreased dramatically on both synthetic and real-worlddatabases.,Granular Computing; 2005 IEEE International Conference on,2005,9

Diverging patterns: discovering significant frequency change dissimilarities in large databases,Aijun An; Qian Wan; Jiashu Zhao; Xiangji Huang,Abstract In this paper; we present a framework for mining diverging patterns; a new type ofcontrast patterns whose frequency changes significantly differently in two data sets; eg; itchanges from a relatively low to a relatively high value in one dataset; but from high to low inthe other. In this framework; a measure called diverging ratio is defined and used to discoverdiverging patterns. We use a four-dimensional vector to represent a pattern; and define thepattern's diverging ratio based on the angular difference between its vectors in two datasets.An algorithm is proposed to mine diverging patterns from a pair of datasets; which makesuse of a standard frequent pattern mining algorithm to compute vector componentsefficiently.

In this work; different complexity measures and methods are applied toidentify the signals in the whole genome of the three prokaryotic organisms. In addition toprevious complexity measures; new measures are introduced for representing OpenReading Frames (ORF). We apply classification algorithms to determine which complexitymeasures can lead to better predictive performance in discriminating genes from pseudo-genes in ORFs. Also; we investigate whether positions and lengths of windows in ORFshave significant impact on distinguishing between genes and pseudo-genes. Differentclassification algorithms are applied for classifying ORFs into genes and pseudo-genes.,Proceedings of the First ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,2010,7
Efficient layered density-based clustering of categorical data,Bill Andreopoulos; Aijun An; Xiaogang Wang; Dirk Labudde,Abstract A challenge involved in applying density-based clustering to categorical biomedicaldata is that the” cube” of attribute values has no ordering defined; making the search fordense subspaces slow. We propose the HIERDENC algorithm for hierarchical density-based clustering of categorical data; and a complementary index for searching for densesubspaces efficiently. The HIERDENC index is updated when new objects are introduced;such that clustering does not need to be repeated on all objects. The updating and clusterretrieval are efficient. Comparisons with several other clustering algorithms showed that onlarge datasets HIERDENC achieved better runtime scalability on the number of objects; aswell as cluster quality. By fast collapsing the bicliques in large networks we achieved anedge reduction of as much as 86.5%. HIERDENC is suitable for large and quickly …,Journal of biomedical informatics,2009,7

Efficient indirect association discovery using compact transaction databases,Qian Wan; Aijun An,Abstract—An indirect association is a special type of negative association that relates twoitems via a mediator. The two items in an indirect association are rarely present together; buteach of them occurs frequently together with the mediator. In this paper; we propose HI-mine*; an innovative optimization of the previously developed HI-mine algorithm for fastextracting indirect associations. This optimization is based on a novel strategy forcompressing a transaction database into a Super Compact Transaction Database; whichdramatically reduces not only the number of transactions in the database; but also thememory requirement for storing frequent-item projections in mining indirect associations.Our experimental results show that the HI-mine* algorithm is effective and efficient; andimproves the performance of indirect association mining significantly.,Granular Computing; 2006 IEEE International Conference on,2006,7

The algorithm learns to identify positive data(session boundaries) and negative data (non-session boundaries) incrementally by usingtwo methods interactively in several iterations. In each iteration; previous identified positiveand negative data are used to build better models; which in turn can label some new dataand improve performance of further iterations. We also present experimental results.,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2005,7
York University at TREC 2005: SPAM Track.,Wei Cao; Aijun An; Xiangji Huang,Abstract We propose a variant of the k-nearest neighbor classification method; calledinstance-weighted k-nearest neighbor method; for adaptive spam filtering. The methodassigns two weights; distance weight and correctness weight; to a training instance; andmakes use of the two weights when classifying a new email. The correctness weight is alsoused in the maintenance of the training data to make the training data more adaptive to thechanges of spam characteristics. We submitted 4 spam filters to the Spam Track. Two of thefilters are purely based on the instance-weighted kNN method. The two other filters combinethe kNN method with other spam filtering and classification techniques. We report the officialresults of our submissions on the Spam Track evaluation data sets.,TREC,2005,7
Probability‐Based Chinese Text Processing and Retrieval,Xiangji Huang; Stephen Robertson; Nick Cercone; Aijun An,Abstract We discuss the use of probability-based natural language processing for Chinesetext retrieval. We focus on comparing different text extraction methods and probabilisticweighting methods. Several document processing methods and probabilistic weightingfunctions are presented. A number of experiments have been conducted on large standardtext collections. We present the experimental results that compare a word-based textprocessing method with a character-based method.

Two-phase pareto set discovery for team formation in social networks,Morteza Zihayat; Mehdi Kargar; Aijun An,In this paper; we study the problem of finding teams of experts from an expert network whileoptimizing three objectives. Given a project; the objective is to find teams of experts thatcover all the required skills and also optimize the communication cost as well as thepersonnel cost and the expertise level of the team members. The expert network is modeledas a graph; where nodes represent experts and edges between nodes specify thecommunication costs between the experts. In this paper; we are interested in finding aPareto front of teams that not only cover the required skills but are also not dominated byother feasible teams with respect to the three criteria. Since the problem is NP-hard; wepropose algorithms to use with a two-phase method to find an approximation of the Paretofront for the three criteria team formation problem. In the first phase; an initial population …,Web Intelligence (WI) and Intelligent Agent Technologies (IAT); 2014 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conferences on,2014,6
S-plasa+: Adaptive sentiment analysis with application to sales performance prediction,Yang Liu; Xiaohui Yu; Xiangji Huang; Aijun An,Abstract Analyzing the large volume of online reviews would produce useful knowledge thatcould be of economic values to vendors and other interested parties. In particular; thesentiments expressed in the online reviews have been shown to be strongly correlated withthe sales performance of products. In this paper; we present an adaptive sentiment analysismodel called S-PLSA+; which aims to capture the hidden sentiment factors in the reviewswith the capability to be incrementally updated as more data become available. We showhow S-PLSA+ can be applied to sales performance prediction using an ARSA modeldeveloped in previous literature. A case study is conducted in the movie domain; and resultsfrom preliminary experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model.,Proceedings of the 33rd international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2010,6
Discovering temporal associations among significant changes in gene expression,Hashmat Rohian; Aijun An; Jiashu Zhao; Xiangji Huang,One of the most demanding problems in mining temporal data is to identify how multivariatechange associations might be discovered and used to better understand data interactionsand dependencies. This paper introduces a framework to mine associations amongsignificant changes in multivariate time-series data. Building on statistical methods; wedetect significant changes in time-series data and use marginal change rates to qualify thedirection of change at significant change points. Furthermore; a propositional confirmation-guided rule discovery method is used to discover associations among these significantchanges. We apply our approach to gene expression data measured in yeast cell cycles anddemonstrate that our method can learn novel and high-quality significant changeassociations among different genes. Such associations can be used to cluster genes and …,Bioinformatics and Biomedicine; 2009. BIBM'09. IEEE International Conference on,2009,6
Finding molecular complexes through multiple layer clustering of protein interaction networks,Bill Andreopoulos; Aijun An; Xiangji Huang; Xiaogang Wang,Clustering protein-protein interaction networks (PINs) helps to identify complexes that guidethe cell machinery. Clustering algorithms often create a flat clustering; without consideringthe layered structure of PINs. We propose the MULIC clustering algorithm that produceslayered clusters. We applied MULIC to five PINs. Clusters correlate with known MIPS proteincomplexes. For example; a cluster of 79 proteins overlaps with a known complex of 88proteins. Proteins in top cluster layers tend to be more representative of complexes thanproteins in bottom layers. Lab work on finding unknown complexes or determining drugeffects can be guided by top layer proteins.,International journal of bioinformatics research and applications,2006,6
Hierarchical grouping of association rules and its application to a real-world domain,Aijun An; S Khan; Xiangji Huang,One common problem in association rule mining is that often a very large number of rulesare generated from the database. The sheer volume of these rules makes it difficult; if notimpossible; for human users to analyze and make use of the rules. In this article; we proposetwo algorithms for grouping and summarizing association rules. The first algorithmrecursively groups rules according to the structure of the rules and generates a tree ofclusters as a result. The second algorithm groups the rules according to the semanticdistance between the rules by making use of a semantic tree-structured network of items. Wepropose an algorithm for automatically tagging the semantic network so that the rules can berepresented as directed line segments in a two-dimensional space and can then be groupedaccording to the distance between line segments.

Thefollowing issues are investigated. First; we make use of the thread structure in the emails tore-rank the documents retrieved by Okapi. We would like to see whether such post-processing of the retrieval result can boost the retrieval performance. Second; in terms ofquery formulation; we investigate whether the use of only title in a topic achieves better orworse results than the inclusion of other fields such as description and narrative. Third; weinvestigate whether stemming and stop word removal play an important role in the emailsearch.

A Bayesian model for canonical circuits in the neocortex for parallelized and incremental learning of symbol representations,Martin Dimkovski; Aijun An,Abstract We present a Bayesian model for parallelized canonical circuits in the neocortex;which can partition a cognitive context into orthogonal symbol representations. The model iscapable of learning from infinite sensory streams; updating itself with every new instanceand without having to keep instances older than the last seen instance per symbol. Theinherently incremental and parallel qualities of the model; allow it to scale to any number ofsymbols as they appear in the sensory stream; and to transparently follow non-stationarydistributions for existing symbols. These qualities are made possible in part by a novelBayesian inference method; which can run Metropolis-Hastings incrementally on a datastream; and significantly outperforms particle filters in a Bayesian neural networkapplication.,Neurocomputing,2015,5
Kea: Sentiment analysis of phrases within short texts,Ameeta Agrawal; Aijun An,Abstract Sentiment Analysis has become an increasingly important research topic. Thispaper describes our approach to building a system for the Sentiment Analysis in Twitter taskof the SemEval-2014 evaluation. The goal is to classify a phrase within a short piece of textas positive; negative or neutral. In the evaluation; classifiers trained on Twitter data aretested on data from other domains such as SMS; blogs as well as sarcasm. The resultsindicate that apart from sarcasm; classifiers built for sentiment analysis of phrases fromtweets can be generalized to other short text domains quite effectively. However; incrossdomain experiments; SMS data is found to generalize even better than Twitter data.,Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2014),2014,5
Affordable and collaborative team formation in an expert network,Mehdi Kargar; Morteza Zihayat; Aijun An,Abstract Given an expert network; we tackle the problem of finding a team of experts thatcovers a set of required skills and also minimizes the communication cost as well as thepersonnel cost of the team. Since two costs need to be minimized; this is a bicriteriaoptimization problem. We show that the problem of minimizing these objectives is NP-hard.We use two approaches to solve this bicriteria optimization problem. In the first approach; wepropose several (α; β)-approximation algorithms that receive a budget on one objective andminimizes the other objective within the budget with guaranteed performance bounds. In thesecond approach; an approximation algorithm is proposed to find a set of Pareto-optimalteams; in which each team is not dominated by other feasible teams in terms of thepersonnel and communication costs. The proposed approximation algorithms have …,Department of Computer Science and Engineering; York University; Technical Report CSE-2013,2013,5
Medical search and classification tools for recommendation,Jimmy Xiangji Huang; Aijun An; Qinmin Hu,Abstract their patients' records from paper to computer; enormous amounts of electronicmedical records (EMR) have become available for medical research. Some of the EMR dataare well-structured; for which traditional database management systems can provideeffective retrieval and management functions. However; most of the EMR data (such asprogress notes and consultation letters) are in free text formats. How to effectively andefficiently retrieve and discover useful information from the vast amount of such semi-structured data is a challenge faced by medical professionals. Without proper tools; the richinformation and knowledge buried in the medical health records are unavailable for clinicalresearch and decision-making.

Efficient duplication free and minimal keyword search in graphs,Mehdi Kargar; Aijun An; Xiaohui Yu,Keyword search over a graph searches for a subgraph that contains a set of querykeywords. A problem with most existing keyword search methods is that they may produceduplicate answers that contain the same set of content nodes (ie; nodes containing a querykeyword) although these nodes may be connected differently in different answers. Thus;users may be presented with many similar answers with trivial differences. In addition; someof the nodes in an answer may contain query keywords that are all covered by other nodesin the answer. Removing these nodes does not change the coverage of the answer but canmake the answer more compact. The answers in which each content node contains at leastone unique query keyword are called minimal answers in this paper. We define the problemof finding duplication-free and minimal answers; and propose algorithms for finding such …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2014,4
Teamexp: Top-k team formation in social networks,Mehdi Kargar; Aijun An,A system for efficient team formation in social networks is demonstrated. Given a projectwhose completion requires a set of skills; our system finds a set of experts that together haveall of the required skills and also have the minimal communication cost. The system finds thebest teams with or without a leader using two types of communication structures. Afterdiscovering the teams of experts; our system can display the relationships among theexperts in a team by showing how the experts are connected in the social network. Since thetotal number of teams might be exponential with respect to the number of required skills;procedures that produce top-k teams of experts with or without a leader in polynomial delayare implemented. The system is demonstrated using the well-known DBLP dataset.,Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW); 2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on,2011,4
Deep parallelization of parallel FP-growth using parent-child MapReduce,Adetokunbo Makanju; Zahra Farzanyar; Aijun An; Nick Cercone; Zane Zhenhua Hu; Yonggang Hu,MapReduce is an important programming model for processing in distributed environments.Compared to other distributed programming models; MapReduce reduces communicationoverheads between computers and improves fault tolerance. However; the MapReducemodel does not allow for automatic synchronization between jobs. A large number of dataanalytics algorithms use a recursive divide-and-conquer approach; which inherently allowsfor parallelism at each level of recursion. However; it is often difficult to parallelize suchalgorithms using the traditional MapReduce model if the process requires synchronization.In this paper we introduce Parent-Child MapReduce; a version of the MapReduceprogramming model that allows for MapReduce tasks to be created dynamically andsynchronized in a hierarchical parent-child fashion.

Reviews are not equally important: Predicting the helpfulness of online reviews,Yang Liu; Xiangji Huang; Aijun An; Xiaohui Yu,Abstract Online reviews provide a valuable resource for potential customers to makepurchase decisions. However; the sheer volume of available reviews as well as the largevariations in the review quality present a big impediment to the effective use of the reviews;as the most helpful reviews may be buried in the large amount of reviews of low qualities.The goal of this paper is to develop models and algorithms for predicting the helpfulness ofreviews; which provides the basis for discovering the most helpful reviews for givenproducts. We first show that the helpfulness of a review depends on three important factors:the reviewer's expertise; the writing style of the review; and the timeliness of the review.Based on the analysis of those factors; we present HelpMeter; a nonlinear regression modelfor helpfulness prediction.

Memory-adaptive high utility sequential pattern mining over data streams,Morteza Zihayat; Yan Chen; Aijun An,Abstract High utility sequential pattern (HUSP) mining has emerged as an important topic indata mining. A number of studies have been conducted on mining HUSPs; but they aremainly intended for non-streaming data and thus do not take data stream characteristics intoconsideration. Streaming data are fast changing; continuously generated unbounded inquantity. Such data can easily exhaust computer resources (eg; memory) unless a properresource-aware mining is performed. In this study; we explore the fundamental problem ofhow limited memory can be best utilized to produce high quality HUSPs over a data stream.We design an approximation algorithm; called MAHUSP; that employs memory adaptivemechanisms to use a bounded portion of memory; in order to efficiently discover HUSPsover data streams.

Efficiently mining high utility sequential patterns in static and streaming data,Morteza Zihayat; Cheng-Wei Wu; Aijun An; Vincent S Tseng; Chien Lin,Abstract High utility sequential pattern (HUSP) mining has emerged as a novel topic in datamining. Although some preliminary works have been conducted on this topic; they incur theproblem of producing a large search space for high utility sequential patterns. In addition;they mainly focus on mining HUSPs in static databases and do not take streaming data intoaccount; where unbounded data come continuously and often at a high speed. To efficientlydeal with both problems; we propose a novel framework for mining high utility sequentialpatterns over static and streaming databases. In this regard; two efficient data structuresnamed ItemUtilLists (Item Utility Lists) and HUSP-Tree (High Utility Sequential Pattern Tree)are proposed to maintain essential information for mining HUSPs in both offline and onlinefashions.

Distributed and parallel high utility sequential pattern mining,Morteza Zihayat; Zane Zhenhua Hut; Aijun An; Yonggang Hut,The problem of mining high utility sequential patterns (HUSP) has been studied recently.Existing solutions are mostly memory-based; which assume that data can fit into the mainmemory of a computer. However; with advent of big data; such an assumption does not holdany longer. Hence; existing algorithms are not applicable to the big data environments;where data are often distributed and too large to be dealt with by a single machine. In thispaper; we propose a new framework for mining HUSPs in big data. A distributed and parallelalgorithm called BigHUSP is proposed to discover HUSPs efficiently. At its heart; BigHUSPuses multiple MapReduce-like steps to process data in parallel. We also propose a numberof pruning strategies to minimize search space in a distributed environment; and thusdecrease computational and communication costs; while still maintaining correctness …,Big Data (Big Data); 2016 IEEE International Conference on,2016,2
Approximate parallel high utility itemset mining,Yan Chen; Aijun An,Abstract High utility itemset mining discovers itemsets whose utility is above a giventhreshold; where the utility measures the importance of an itemset. It overcomes thelimitation of frequent pattern mining; which uses frequency as its quality measure. To speedup the performance for mining high utility itemsets; many algorithms have been proposedwhich usually focus on optimizing the candidate generation process. However; memory andtime performance limitations still cause scalability issues; especially when the dataset is verylarge. In this paper; the problem is addressed by proposing a distributed parallel algorithm;PHUI-Miner; and a sampling strategy; which can be used either separately orsimultaneously. PHUI-Miner parallelizes the state-of-the-art high utility itemset miningalgorithm HUI-Miner. In PHUI-Miner; the search space of the high utility itemset mining …,Big Data Research,2016,2
Ranking Documents Through Stochastic Sampling on Bayesian Network-based Models: A Pilot Study,Xing Tan; Jimmy Xiangji Huang; Aijun An,Abstract Using approximate inference techniques; we investigate in this paper theapplicability of Bayesian Networks to the problem of ranking a large set of documents.Topology of the network is a bipartite. Network parameters (conditional probabilitydistributions) are determined through an adoption of the weighting scheme tf-idf. Rank of adocument with respect to a given query is defined as the corresponding posterior probability;which is estimated through performing Rejection Sampling. Experimental results suggestthat performance of the model is at least comparable to the baseline ones such as BM25.The framework of this model potentially offers new and novel ways in weighting documents.Integrating the model with other ranking algorithms; meanwhile; is expected to bring inperformance improvement in document ranking.,Proceedings of the 39th International ACM SIGIR conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,2016,2
Topic modeling using collapsed typed dependency relations,Elnaz Delpisheh; Aijun An,Abstract Topic modeling is a powerful tool to uncover hidden thematic structures ofdocuments. Many conventional topic models represent documents as a bag-of-words; wherethe important linguistic structures of documents are neglected. In this paper; we propose anovel topic model that enriches text documents with collapsed typed dependency relationsto effectively acquire syntactic and semantic dependencies between consecutive andnonconsecutive words of text documents. In addition; we propose to enforce coherent topicassignments for conceptually similar words by generalizing words with their synonyms. Ourexperimental studies show that the proposed model and strategy outperform the originalLDA model and the Bigram Topic Model in terms of perplexity; and our performance iscomparable to other models in terms of stability; coherence; and accuracy.,Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2014,2
Partial drift detection using a rule induction framework,Damon Sotoudeh; Aijun An,Abstract The major challenge in mining data streams is the issue of concept drift; thetendency of the underlying data generation process to change over time. In this paper; wepropose a general rule learning framework that can efficiently handle concept-drifting datastreams and maintain a highly accurate classification model. The main idea is to focus onpartial drifts by allowing individual rules to monitor the stream and detect if there is a drift inthe regions they cover. A rule quality measure then decides whether the affected rules areinconsistent with the concept drift. The model is accordingly updated to only include rulesthat are consistent with the newly arrived concept. A dynamically maintained set of instancesdeemed relevant to the most recent concept is also kept at memory. Learning a new conceptfrom a larger set of instances reduces the variance of data distribution and allows for a …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2010,2
The effect of sequence complexity on the construction of protein-protein interaction networks,Mehdi Kargar; Aijun An,Abstract In this paper; the role of sequence complexity in the construction of important nodesin protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks is investigated. We use two complexitymeasures; linguistic complexity and Shanon entropy; to measure the complexity of proteinsequences. Three different datasets of yeast PPI networks are used to conclude the results.It has been shown that there are two important types of nodes in the PPI networks; which arehub and bottleneck nodes. It has been shown recently that hubs and bottlenecks tend to beessential in the process of evolution. Better understanding of the properties of these twotypes of nodes will shed light on why proteins interact with each other in the observedmanner. We show that the sequence complexity of hubs are lower than that of non-hubs. Butthe difference is not significant in most cases.

Diverging patterns: Discovering significant dissimilarities in large databases,Qian Wan; Aijun An,Abstract The problem of finding contrast patterns has recently attracted much attention. As aresult; a number of promising methods have been proposed to capture significantdifferences or changes between two or more datasets. Such differences can be captured byemerging patterns and some other types of contrasts. In this paper; we present a frameworkfor mining diverging patterns; a new type of contrast patterns whose frequency changes indifferent directions in two data sets; eg; it changes from a relatively low to a relatively highvalue in one dataset; but from high to low in the other. In this framework; a measure calleddiverging ratio is used to discover diverging patterns. We use a two-dimensional vector torepresent a pattern; and define the pattern's diverging ratio based on the angular differencebetween its vectors in two datasets.

A Framework for Unsupervised Learning with Multiple Criteria,Bill Andreopoulos; Aijun An; Xiaogang Wang,Abstract. Unsupervised learning algorithms that have been presented in the literature so far;rarely incorporate more than one criterion for learning. Moreover; the results from learningbased on old criteria are not incorporated into the process of learning based on new criteria.This paper presents a framework for unsupervised learning called Doctris “Double CriteriaTriple Step”. Learning algorithms based on Doctris use two different criteria at two levels oflearning. The first level forms a prior for the second level; simulating a Bayesian process. Werefer to this process as multi—criteria unsupervised learning. We justify Doctris with theBayesian theory of classification. We present a metric for evaluating the results.

Alongside we implement a jumping mechanism which we callshadow casting to help geodesics jump to locations closer to the global optimum.

In addition;some inferred topics may be described by words that are not much relevant to each otherand are thus considered low quality topics. In this paper; we propose a novel method thatnot only assigns a label to each topic but also identifies low quality topics by providing areliability score for the label of each topic. Our rationale is that a topic labeling methodcannot provide a good label for a low quality topic; and thus predicting label reliability is asimportant as topic labeling itself. We propose a novel measure (Ontology-Based …,International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems,2015,1
Memory-bounded high utility sequential pattern mining over data streams,Morteza Zihayat; Y Chan; Aijun An,Abstract Mining high utility sequential patterns (HUSPs) has emerged as an important topicin data mining. However; the existing studies on this topic focus on static data and do notconsider streaming data. Streaming data are fast changing; continuously generated andunbounded in amount. Such data can easily exhaust computer resources (eg; memory)unless proper resource-aware mining is performed. In this study; we explore a fundamentalproblem that is how the limited memory space can be well utilized to produce high qualityHUSPs over a data stream. We design an approximation algorithm; called MAHUSP; thatemploys memory adaptive mechanisms to use a bounded portion of memory; to efficientlydiscover HUSPs over data streams. MAHUSP guarantees that all HUSPs are discoveredunder certain circumstances. Our experimental study shows that our algorithm cannot …,*,2015,1
Duplication free and minimal keyword search in large graphs,Mehdi Kargar; Aijun An; Xiaohui Yu,Abstract—Keyword search over a graph searches for a subgraph that contains a set of querykeywords. A problem with most existing keyword search methods is that they may produceduplicate answers that contain the same set of content nodes (ie; nodes containing a querykeyword) although these nodes may be connected differently in different answers. Thus;users may be presented with many similar answers with trivial differences. In addition; someof the nodes in an answer may contain query,Department of Computer Science and Engineering; York University; Technical Report CSE-2013,2013,1

Towards automatic acquisition of a fully sense tagged corpus for persian,Bahareh Sarrafzadeh; Nikolay Yakovets; Nick Cercone; Aijun An,Abstract Sense tagged corpora play a crucial role in Natural Language Processing;particularly in Word Sense Disambiguation and Natural Language Understanding. Sincesemantic annotations are usually performed by humans; such corpora are limited to ahandful of tagged texts and are not available for many languages with scarce resourcesincluding Persian. The shortage of efficient; reliable linguistic resources and fundamentaltext processing modules for Persian have been a challenge for researchers investigatingthis language. We employ a newly-proposed cross-lingual sense disambiguation algorithmto automatically create large sense tagged corpora. The initial evaluation of the taggedcorpus indicates promising results.,International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems,2011,1
Promoting Diversity in Top Hits for Biomedical Passage Retrieval,Bill Andreopoulos; Xiangji Huang; Aijun An; Dirk Labudde; Qinmin Hu,Abstract With the volume of biomedical literature exploding; such as BMC or PubMed; it is ofparamount importance to have scalable passage retrieval systems that allow researchers toquickly find desired information. While topical relevance is the most important factor inbiomedical text retrieval; an effective retrieval system needs to also cover diverse aspects ofthe topic. Aspect-level performance means that top-ranked passages for a topic shouldcover diverse aspects. Aspect-level retrieval methods often involve clustering the retrievedpassages on the basis of textual similarity. We propose the HIERDENC text retrieval systemthat ranks the retrieved passages; achieving scalability and improved aspect-levelperformance over other clustering methods. HIERDENC runtimes scale on large datasets;such as PubMed and BMC. The HIERDENC aspect-level performance is consistently …,*,2009,1
Web Usage Mining with Web Logs,Xiangji Huang,Abstract With the rapid growth of the World Wide Web; the use of automated Web-miningtechniques to discover useful and relevant information has become increasingly important.One challenging direction is Web usage mining; wherein one attempts to discover usernavigation patterns of Web usage from Web access logs. Properly exploited; the informationobtained from Web usage log can assist us to improve the design of a Web site; refinequeries for effective Web search; and build personalized search engines. However; Web logdata are usually large in size and extremely detailed; because they are likely to record everyaspect of a user request to a Web server. It is thus of great importance to process the rawWeb log data in an appropriate way; and identify the target information intelligently.

Fast Counting with AV-Space for Efficient Rule Induction,Linyan Wang; Aijun An,Abstract We present AV-space; a new data structure for caching data set statistics forefficiently learning classification rules from large data sets. The AV-space is designed towork with sequential-covering rule induction algorithms. It is used to accelerate queriesabout the count of the examples in a data set that satisfy a conjunction of attribute-valuepairs. With an AV-space; the learning algorithm does not have to access the training data toobtain the statistics about the data. We present the structure of an AV-space; algorithms forbuilding and querying an AV-space; and procedures for dynamically updating the AV-spaceduring the rule induction process. We present an experimental evaluation that compares theAV-space with a commonly-used data structure that simply loads the (encoded) trainingexamples into memory.

York University at TREC 2005: HARD Track.,Miao Wen; Xiangji Huang; Aijun An; Yan Rui Huang,Abstract In an IR model;“user”;“query” and “result” are three important components.Traditionally; a query is considered to be independent of the user. IR systems searchdocuments without considering who issues the query and why the query is asked. However;those factors can affect the user's satisfaction about the result. The information about theuser; such as the genre preference of the user; occupation of the user; location of the user;which are normally called personalized information; indicate users' preferences to theretrieval result. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a dual indexing technique and afeedback method on the HARD 2005 data set. We also propose a non-content basedmethod to measure user's familiarity to a query. A similarity model is built to utilize thefamiliarity information and to improve the overall performance.,TREC,2005,1
SQL-relay: An event-driven rule-based database gateway,Qingsong Yao; Aijun An,Abstract Database users often submit similar queries to retrieve certain information from thedatabase. We use user access event to represent a set of similar queries. A user accessevent contains an SQL template and a set of parameters; where the value of a parametercan be a constant or a variable. For example; event (“select name from customer whereid=%”; 101) represents a single query which retrieves the name of customer 101; whileevent (“select name from customer where id=%”; g_cid) represents a set of queries thatsretrieve the name of given customer. The event execution orders are represented by usingdependency graphs; which are called user access paths.,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2003,1

Mining significant high utility gene regulation sequential patterns,Morteza Zihayat; Heidar Davoudi; Aijun An,Mining frequent gene regulation sequential patterns in time course microarray datasets is animportant mining task in bioinformatics. Although finding such patterns are of paramountimportant for studying a disease; most existing work do not consider gene-diseaseassociation during gene regulation sequential pattern discovery. Moreover; they considermore absent/existence effects of genes during the mining process than taking the degrees ofgenes expression into account. Consequently; such techniques discover too many patternswhich may not represent important information to biologists to investigate the relationshipsbetween the disease and underlying reasons hidden in gene regulation sequences. Wepropose a utility model by considering both the gene-disease association score and theirdegrees of expression levels under a biological investigation.

Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Neural Networks,Ricky Fok; Aijun An; Xiaogang Wang,Abstract: We propose a framework to understand the unprecedented performance androbustness of deep neural networks using field theory. Correlations between the weightswithin the same layer can be described by symmetries in that layer; and networks generalizebetter if such symmetries are broken to reduce the redundancies of the weights. Using a twoparameter field theory; we find that the network can break such symmetries itself towards theend of training in a process commonly known in physics as spontaneous symmetrybreaking. This corresponds to a network generalizing itself without any user input layers tobreak the symmetry; but by communication with adjacent layers. In the layer decoupling limitapplicable to residual networks (He et al.; 2015); we show that the remnant symmetries thatsurvive the non-linear layers are spontaneously broken.

Optimization assisted MCMC,Ricky Fok; Aijun An; Xiaogang Wang,Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods are widely used but oftenencounter either slow convergence or biased sampling when applied to multimodal highdimensional distributions. In this paper; we present a general framework of improvingclassical MCMC samplers by employing a global optimization method. The globaloptimization method first reduces a high dimensional search to an one dimensionalgeodesic to find a starting point close to a local mode. The search is accelerated andcompleted by using a local search method such as BFGS. We modify the target distributionby extracting a local Gaussian distribution aound the found mode. The process is repeatedto find all the modes during sampling on the fly. We integrate the optimization algorithm intothe Wormhole Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (WHMC) method.

Time-Aware Subscription Prediction Model for User Acquisition in Digital News Media,Heidar Davoudi; Morteza Zihayat; Aijun An,Abstract User acquisition is one of the most challenging problems for online news providers.In fact; due to availability of different news media; users have a lot of choices in selecting thenews source. To date; most of digital news portals have tried to approach the solutionindirectly by targeting the user satisfaction through the recommendation systems. In contrast;we address the problem directly by identifying valuable visitors who are likely potentialsubscribers in the future. First; we suggest that the decision for subscription is not a sudden;instantaneous action; but is the informed decision based on positive experience with digitalmedium. As such; we propose effective engagement measures and show that they areeffective in building the predictive model for subscription.

Contrast Pattern Based Collaborative Behavior Recommendation for Life Improvement,Yan Chen; Margot Lisa-Jing Yann; Heidar Davoudi; Joy Choi; Aijun An; Zhen Mei,Abstract Positive attitudes and happiness have major impacts on human health and inparticular recovery from illness. While contributing factors leading human beings to positiveemotional states are studied in psychology; the effects of these factors vary and change fromone person to another. We propose a behaviour recommendation system that recommendsthe most effective behaviours leading users with a negative mental state (ie unhappiness) toa positive emotional state (ie; happiness). By leveraging the contrast pattern miningframework; we extract the common contrasting behaviours between happy and unhappyusers. These contrast patterns are aligned with user behaviours and habits. We find thepersonalized behaviour recommendation for those with negative emotional states by placingthe problem into the nearest neighborhood collaborative filtering framework.

Mining Evolving Data Streams with Particle Filters,Ricky Fok; Aijun An; Xiaogang Wang,Abstract We propose a particle filter-based learning method; PF-LR; for learning logisticregression models from evolving data streams. The method inherently handles concept driftsin a data stream and is able to learn an ensemble of logistic regression models with particlefiltering. A key feature of PF-LR is that in its resampling; step particles are sampled from theones that maximize the classification accuracy on the current data batch. Our experimentsshow that PF-LR gives good performance; even with relatively small batch sizes. It reacts toconcept drifts quicker than conventional particle filters while being robust to noise. Inaddition; PF-LR learns more accurate models and is more computationally efficient than thegradient descent method for learning logistic regression models. Furthermore; we evaluatePF-LR on both synthetic and real data sets and find that PF-LR outperforms some other …,Computational Intelligence,2017,*
Time aware topic based recommender system,Elnaz Delpisheh; Aijun An; Heidar Davoudi; Emad Gohari Boroujerdi,News recommender systems efficiently handle the overwhelming number of news articles;simplify navigations; and retrieve relevant information. Many conventional newsrecommender systems use collaborative filtering to make recommendations based on thebehavior of users in the system. In this approach; the introduction of new users or new itemscan cause the cold start problem; as there will be insufficient data on these new entries forthe collaborative filtering to draw any inferences for new users or items. Content-based newsrecommender systems emerged to address the cold start problem. However; many content-based news recommender systems consider documents as a bag-of-words neglecting thehidden themes of the news articles.

Computational Role of Astrocytes in Bayesian Inference and Probability Distribution Encoding,Martin Dimkovski; Aijun An,Abstract The past few years have seen new research methods confirming more confidentlythat glia have a key information processing role in the brain; specifically in relation tolearning capability. However; many details Tof glia's role remain unknown; including a gapbetween cellular and behavioural level findings. Based on Ca^ 2+ wave mechanics inastrocytes; we derive a theoretical capability of astrocytes to encode cognitiverepresentations as probability distributions over synapses. The process is analogous toMCMC Bayesian inference that samples a neural network configuration from a prior in theastrocyte and then uses its performance to update to a posterior distribution. The proposedmodel explains recent behavioural results where obstructing astrocytes leads to deficienciesin learning new knowledge without affecting ability to recall existing knowledge.

Selective Co-occurrences for Word-Emotion Association,Ameeta Agrawal; Aijun An,Abstract Emotion classification from text typically requires some degree of word-emotionassociation; either gathered from pre-existing emotion lexicons or calculated using somemeasure of semantic relatedness. Most emotion lexicons contain a fixed number of emotioncategories and provide a rather limited coverage. Current measures of computing semanticrelatedness; on the other hand; do not adapt well to the specific task of word-emotionassociation and therefore; yield average results. In this work; we propose an unsupervisedmethod of learning word-emotion association from large text corpora; called Selective Co-occurrences (SECO); by leveraging the property of mutual exclusivity generally exhibited byemotions.

Building FP-Tree on the Fly: Single-Pass Frequent Itemset Mining,Nima Shahbazi; Rohollah Soltani; Jarek Gryz; Aijun An,Abstract The FP-Growth algorithm has been studied extensively in the field of frequentpattern mining. The algorithm offers the advantage of avoiding costly database scans incomparison with Apriori-based algorithms. However; since it still requires two databasescans; it cannot be used on streaming data. Also; the algorithm is designed for staticdatasets; where the input transactions are fixed and thus cannot be used for incremental orinteractive mining. Existing incremental mining algorithms are not easily adoptable for on-the-fly; fast; and memory efficient FP-tree mining. In this paper we propose a novel SPFP-tree (single pass frequent pattern tree) algorithm that scans the database only once andprovides the same tree as FP-Growth.

Mining HUSPs over data streams is very desirablefor many applications. However; addressing this topic is not an easy task. First; streamingdata come continuously in high speed and the mining result should be instantly availablewhen users request it. Second; we need to overcome the problem of combinatorialexplosion of a large search space. Third; pruning search space for HUSP mining is difficultbecause the downward closure property does not hold for the utility of sequences.

However; n1ost of the existing frequent pattern mining algorithms (such asApTi07 't and FP-growth) do not consider the time stamps associated with the transactions.In this paper; we extend the existing frequent pattern mining framework to take into accountthe time stamp of each transaction and discover patterns whose frequency dramaticallychanges over time. V\/e deﬁne a new type of patterns; called progressive patterns; to capturethe dynamic behavior of frequent patterns in a transaction database. Progressive patternsinclude both progressive frequent and progressive infrequent patterns. Their frequenciesincrease/decrease dramatically at some time point of a transaction database. We …,*,2007,*
Translation and rotation invariant mining of frequent trajectories: application to protein unfolding pathways,Alexander Andreopoulos; Bill Andreopoulos; Aijun An; Xiaogang Wang,Abstract We present a framework for mining frequent trajectories; which are translatedand/or rotated with respect to one another. We then discuss a multiresolution methodology;based on the wavelet transformation; for speeding up the discovery of frequent trajectories.We present experimental results using noisy protein unfolding trajectories and syntheticdatasets. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches for findingfrequent trajectories.

A Framework for Clustering Categorical Data based on Empirical Distributions,Bill Andreopoulos; Aijun An; Xiaogang Wang,ABSTRACT Density-based clustering algorithms often have a solid rnathematical basis. Achallenge involved in applying densitybased clustering to categorical data sets is that the'cube'of attribute values has no ordering deﬁned. In this paper we propose the CEEDframework for clustering categorical data based on its empirical probability distribution.CEED offers a basis for designing categorical clustering algorithms that balance the tradeoffof accuracy and speed. The advantages of CEED are: it offers a probabilistic basis forclustering categorical data; it minimizes the user-speciﬁed input parameters. it is insensitiveto the order of the input objects7 it can discover clusters of arbitrary shapes and sizes. Wepresent a faster approximation of CEED called the MULIC algorithm; which is designed forcategorical data sets with a'rrLulti—la'yered structure. VVe evaluate CEED and MULIC on …,*,2006,*
Integration of Genomic; Proteomic and Biomedical Information,Bill Andreopoulos; Aijun An; Xiangji Huang,Abstract: Researchers are faced with the challenge of integrating on the basis of a commonSemantic Web framework the information on biological functions resulting from genomic andproteomic experimental studies. Researchers would also like to integrate the biologicalfunctions' roles in larger biomedical conditions; which will support automated analysis andreasoning on the Semantic Web. We address these challenges by proposing the IGIPIframework; standing for “Integrating Gene Interactions and Protein Interactions”. IGIPI viewsdifferent experimental studies as pieces of a puzzle that if positioned properly will contributeto a more complete representation of a biological function or biomedical condition. Thisframework allows representing the relative time points of events. The IGIPI frameworkinvolves integrating different ontologies and vocabularies; including the Gene Ontology …,*,2005,*
Finding Molecular Complexes through Multiple Layer Clustering,Bill Andreopoulos; Aijun An; Xiangji Huang; Xiaogang Wang,Results: We propose the MULIC clustering algorithm that produces layered clusters of PINdata. We applied MULIC clustering to five PINs; including three yeast PINs. MULIC clusterscorrelate with known protein complexes in the MIPS database. For example; a large clusterof 79 proteins significantly overlaps with a known complex of 88 proteins. Conclusions:MULIC clustering can assist in predicting protein complexes. Given the layered structure ofthe MULIC clusters; the proteins in top layers tend to be more representative of proteincomplexes than proteins in bottom layers. Lab experiments on finding an unknown complexor determining the potential effects of a drug can initially be guided by proteins in top layersand later move to bottom layers of clusters.

Clustering the Internet Topology at the AS-level,Bill Andreopoulos; Aijun An; Xiaogang Wang,Abstract: Clustering algorithms presented in the literature are rarely designed for the layeredstructure of the Internet topology and its unknown number of clusters. A recent approach inthe research community is to collect IP path data and to map the IPs to known AutonomousSystems (ASs) forming the Internet backbones; resulting in large data sets of AS links.Clustering data sets of AS links permits inferring business relationships between ASs. Wepropose the MULICsoft algorithm for this purpose. MULICsoft clusters categorical data setswhere the objects to be clustered are ASs and each categorical attribute value (CA)represents a link between ASs. Each CA has a 'weight'in the range of 0.0 to 1.0; that isinversely related to the number of unknown ASs in a link between ASs. MULICsoft producesas many clusters as it can find in the data set and each cluster consists of layers.

A Framework for Unsupervised Learning VVith Multiple Criteria,Bill Andreopoulos; Aijun An,Abstract. Unsupervised learning algorithms that have been presented in the literature so far;rarely incorporate more than one criterion for learning. Moreover; the results from learningbased on old criteria are not incorporated into the process of learning based on new criteria.This paper presents a framework for unsupervised learning called Doctris “Double CriteriaTriple Step”. Learning algorithms based on Doctris use two different criteria at two levels oflearning. The first level forms a prior for the second level; simulating a Bayesian process. Werefer to this process as multi-criteria unsupervised learning. We justify Doctris with theBayesian theory of classification. We present a metric for evaluating the results. We discussextending Doctris to use more than two criteria. We describe the BILCOM clusteringalgorithm as an example of Doctris. Experimental results from clustering mixed data types …,*,2005,*
Multi-Layer Increasing Coherence Clustering of Autonomous Systems with MULICsoft,Bill Andreopoulos; Aijun An; Xiaogang Wang,ABSTRACT Discovering the properties of the Internet topology is crucial for the use;maintenance and optimization of the Internet. A recent approach in the research communityis to collect IP path data from active probing of hosts and to map the IP paths to knownAutonomous System (AS) paths. We apply the MULICsoft clustering algorithm to networkdata for ASs forming the Internet backbones. MULICsoft is intended for categorical data setswhere each categorical attribute value (CA) has a 'weight'in the range 0.0 to 1.0; indicatinghow strongly the corresponding CA should inﬂuence the clustering process.

Multi-Layer Increasing Coherence Clustering of Large Software Data Sets with MULICsoft,Bill Andreopoulos; Aijun An; Xiaogang Wang,Abstract We present the MULICs0ft software clustering tool. This tool is intended forcategorical data sets in which each categorical attribute value (CA) has a 'weight'in therange 0.0 to 1.0; indicating how strongly the corresponding CA should influence theclustering process. MULICs0ft produces as many clusters as there naturally exist in the dataset. Each cluster consists of layers formed gradually through iterations; by reducing thesimilarity criterion for inserting objects in layers of a cluster at diﬂerent iterations. We haveapplied this tool to clustering the mozilla software system. The objects in the data are files.The CAs represent the relationships; such as invocation and dependency relationships;between files. The weights depend on the number of times that each ﬁle invoked other filesduring a run time profiling of execution. The results of MULICs0ft are better than those of …,*,2005,*

Is internet access and use beyond the reachof ordinary people with ordinary intelligence? Ignoring for the moment economic issues ofaccess for all citizenry; what is it about internet access and use that hinders morewidespread acceptability? We explore several issues; not exclusive; that attempt to provokeand poke at answers to these simple questions. Largely speculative; as invited talks ought tobe. we explore 3 topics; well studied but as yet generally unsolved; in computationalintelligence and explore their impact on web intelligence. These topics are machinetranslation; machine learning; and user interface design.

Design and implementation of a Chinese full-text retrieval system based on a probabilistic model,Xiangji Huang; Aijun An,Full-text retrieval has the advantages of searching documents over a wide range of wordsand accessing original text directly. However; because of the inadequate processing speedand insufficient memory capacity; there has been little work done on full text retrievalsystems in the past. With the emergence of very large capacity compact disk ROM (CDROM); research in full-text retrieval systems is becoming increasingly important. Practicalsystems based on Boolean retrieval models have appeared. However; in spite of its ability toprocess structured queries; the Boolean model has been criticised for its inability to provideranked output as all retrieved documents are considered equally important. Probabilisticmodels have been proposed by some scholars to solve this problem and have successfullybeen implemented on a small scale trial basis in indexing retrieval systems. This paper …,TENCON'93.

Meaningful Keyword Search over Databases with Complex Schema,Mehdi Kargar; Aijun An; Parke Godfrey; Jaroslaw Szlichta; Xiaohui Yu,Much of the world's high-quality data stays under lock and key in relational databases. Accessis gained through relational query languages such as SQL. However; a lay user—anyone whodoes not know SQL or who is not well versed in the given schema—is effectively locked out[1; 4]. As the schemas of the datasets that organizations field become more complex; we all effectivelybecome lay users. Keyword search has recently been used for extracting information from relationaldatabases. An answer to the query is a set of tuples from the database that cover the keywordsof the query; and a natural structure (ie; a tree from the database's schema) that spans thosetuples. An important issue in keyword search is to score answers for relevance. Prior work hasaddressed relevance. In [3]; a simplistic solution of scoring relevance as the reciprocal of thenumber of edges in an answer's tree was proposed. In [2]; the authors apply information …,*,*,*

However; we focus on analyzing the magnitude of a givenevent from a collection of text documents such as news articles from multiple sources. Weuse violence as an illustration as it is one of the most critical factors of forced migration. Therecent advancements in semantic similarity measures are adopted to obtain relevantviolence scores for each word in the vocabulary of news articles in an unsupervised manner.The resulting scores are then used to compute the average daily violence scores over a …,*,*,*

Meaningful Keyword Search in RDBMS,Mehdi Kargar; Aijun An; Parke Godfrey; Jaroslaw Szlichta; Xiaohui Yu,ABSTRACT Keyword search over relational databases offers an alterna- tive way to SQL to queryand explore databases that is effective for lay users who may not be well versed in SQL or thedatabase schema. This becomes more pertinent for databases with large and complexschemas. An answer in this context is a join tree spanning tuples containing the query'skeywords. As there are potentially many answers to the query; and the user is often only interestedin seeing the top-k answers; how to rank the answers based on their relevance is of paramountimportance. We focus on the relevance of join as the fundamental means to rank answers. Wedevise means to measure rel- evance of relations and foreign keys in the schema over the informationcontent of the database. This can be done of- fline with no need for external models. We comparethe proposed measures against a gold standard we derive from a real workload over …,*,*,*

Distance-based database user sessions clustering,Qingsong Yao; Aijun An; Xiangji Huang,Abstract. It has been brought into attention that analysis of task-oriented database usersessions provides useful insight into the query behavior of database users. A database usersession is a sequence of queries issued by a user (or an application) to achieve a certaintask. It consists of one or more database transactions; which are in turn a sequence ofoperations performed as a logical unit of work. In this paper; we assume a set of sessioninstances are already obtained; and focus on grouping these sessions into different sessionclasses. We propose a distancebased clustering algorithm which is based on three sessionsimilarity metrics between sessions. We also show experimental results.,*,*,*

ELEM2 Rule Induction System,Aijun An; Nick Cercone,ELEM2 [1] is a rule induction system that generates rules from a set of data and uses thegenerated rules to classify (new) cases in another set of data. In this manual; we describehow to use the ELEM2 (Version 3.0) rule induction system. The system contains threeexecutable programs: elem2v3. exe; test. exe and cvelem2. exe. The program elem2v3. exeis a rule induction program that generates a set of classification rules from a set of trainingdata. The program test. exe is a classification program; which uses the rules generated byelem2v3. exe and classifies the cases in a test data file. The program cvelem2. exe is across-validation program that can be used to evaluate ELEM2 on a data set using n-foldcross-validation. To run these programs; the user has to prepare the training and testingdata. In this manual; we describe how to prepare these data files; how to run the three …,*,*,*
