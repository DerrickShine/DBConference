-Supporting Frequent Updates in R-Trees: A Bottom-Up Approach,Mong Li Lee; Wynne Hsu; Christian S Jensen; Bin Cui; Keng Lik Teo,This paper proposes a generalized bottom-up update strategy for R-trees. This strategy ismotivated by the class of monitoring applications; which are characterized by large volumesof updates; and the increasingly important role of indexing. This update strategy can easilybe applied to the members of the family of R-tree-based indexing techniques; as it preservesthe index structure and takes into account concurrency control. The strategy improves therobustness of R-trees by supporting different levels of index reorganization—ranging fromlocal to global—during updates; thus using expensive top-down updates only whennecessary. This chapter presents a compact main-memory summary structure along withefficient bottom-up algorithms that reduce the numbers of disk accesses and CPU resourcesused for update and querying. Empirical studies indicate that the new strategy …,*,2003,236
LCARS: a location-content-aware recommender system,Hongzhi Yin; Yizhou Sun; Bin Cui; Zhiting Hu; Ling Chen,Abstract Newly emerging location-based and event-based social network services provideus with a new platform to understand users' preferences based on their activity history. Auser can only visit a limited number of venues/events and most of them are within a limiteddistance range; so the user-item matrix is very sparse; which creates a big challenge fortraditional collaborative filtering-based recommender systems. The problem becomes morechallenging when people travel to a new city where they have no activity history. In thispaper; we propose LCARS; a location-content-aware recommender system that offers aparticular user a set of venues (eg; restaurants) or events (eg; concerts and exhibitions) bygiving consideration to both personal interest and local preference. This recommendersystem can facilitate people's travel not only near the area in which they live; but also in a …,Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2013,215
Routing questions to the right users in online communities,Yanhong Zhou; Gao Cong; Bin Cui; Christian S Jensen; Junjie Yao,Online forums contain huge amounts of valuable user-generated content. In current forumsystems; users have to passively wait for other users to visit the forum systems andread/answer their questions. The user experience for question answering suffers from thisarrangement. In this paper; we address the problem of" pushing" the right questions to theright persons; the objective being to obtain quick; high-quality answers; thus improving usersatisfaction. We propose a framework for the efficient and effective routing of a givenquestion to the top-k potential experts (users) in a forum; by utilizing both the content andstructures of the forum system. First; we compute the expertise of users according to thecontent of the forum system—-this is to estimate the probability of a user being an expert fora given question based on the previous question answering of the user. Specifically; we …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,111
Parallel distributed processing of constrained skyline queries by filtering,Bin Cui; Hua Lu; Quanqing Xu; Lijiang Chen; Yafei Dai; Yongluan Zhou,Skyline queries are capable of retrieving interesting points from a large data set according tomultiple criteria. Most work on skyline queries so far has assumed a centralized storage;whereas in practice relevant data are often distributed among geographically scattered sites.In this work; we tackle constrained skyline queries in large-scale distributed environmentswithout the assumption of any overlay structures; and propose a novel algorithm namedPaDSkyline (Parallel Distributed Skyline query processing). PaDSkyline significantlyshortens the response time by performing parallel processing over site groups produced bya partition algorithm. Within each group; it locally optimizes the query processing overdistributed sites. It also drastically enhances the network transmission efficiency byperforming early reduction of skyline candidates with deliberately selected multiple …,Data Engineering; 2008. ICDE 2008.

Challenging the long tail recommendation,Hongzhi Yin; Bin Cui; Jing Li; Junjie Yao; Chen Chen,Abstract The success of" infinite-inventory" retailers such as Amazon. com and Netflix hasbeen largely attributed to a" long tail" phenomenon. Although the majority of their inventoryis not in high demand; these niche products; unavailable at limited-inventory competitors;generate a significant fraction of total revenue in aggregate. In addition; tail productavailability can boost head sales by offering consumers the convenience of" one-stopshopping" for both their mainstream and niche tastes. However; most of existingrecommender systems; especially collaborative filter based methods; can not recommendtail products due to the data sparsity issue. It has been widely acknowledged that torecommend popular products is easier yet more trivial while to recommend long tail productsadds more novelty yet it is also a more challenging task. In this paper; we propose a novel …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2012,99

Efficient index-based KNN join processing for high-dimensional data,Cui Yu; Bin Cui; Shuguang Wang; Jianwen Su,Abstract In many advanced database applications (eg; multimedia databases); data objectsare transformed into high-dimensional points and manipulated in high-dimensional space.One of the most important but costly operations is the similarity join that combines similarpoints from multiple datasets. In this paper; we examine the problem of processing K-nearestneighbor similarity join (KNN join). KNN join between two datasets; R and S; returns for eachpoint in R its K most similar points in S. We propose a new index-based KNN join approachusing the iDistance as the underlying index structure. We first present its basic algorithm andthen propose two different enhancements. In the first enhancement; we optimize the originalKNN join algorithm by using approximation bounding cubes. In the second enhancement;we exploit the reduced dimensions of data space. We conducted an extensive …,Information and Software Technology,2007,84
A temporal context-aware model for user behavior modeling in social media systems,Hongzhi Yin; Bin Cui; Ling Chen; Zhiting Hu; Zi Huang,Abstract Social media provides valuable resources to analyze user behaviors and captureuser preferences.

Contorting high dimensional data for efficient main memory KNN processing,Bin Cui; Beng Chin Ooi; Jianwen Su; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract In this paper; we present a novel index structure; called Δ-tree; to speed upprocessing of high-dimensional K-nearest neighbor (KNN) queries in main memoryenvironment. The Δ-tree is a multi-level structure where each level represents the dataspace at different dimensionalities: the number of dimensions increases towards the leaflevel which contains the data at their full dimensions. The remaining dimensions areobtained using Principal Component Analysis; which has the desirable property that the firstfew dimensions capture most of the information in the dataset. Each level of the tree servesto prune the search space more efficiently as the reduced dimensions can better exploit thesmall cache line size. Moreover; the distance computation on lower dimensionality is lessexpensive. We also propose an extension; called Δ+-tree; that globally clusters the data …,Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2003,66

Modeling location-based user rating profiles for personalized recommendation,Hongzhi Yin; Bin Cui; Ling Chen; Zhiting Hu; Chengqi Zhang,Abstract This article proposes LA-LDA; a location-aware probabilistic generative model thatexploits location-based ratings to model user profiles and produce recommendations. Mostof the existing recommendation models do not consider the spatial information of users oritems; however; LA-LDA supports three classes of location-based ratings; namely spatialuser ratings for nonspatial items; nonspatial user ratings for spatial items; and spatial userratings for spatial items. LA-LDA consists of two components; ULA-LDA and ILA-LDA; whichare designed to take into account user and item location information; respectively. Thecomponent ULA-LDA explicitly incorporates and quantifies the influence from local publicpreferences to produce recommendations by considering user home locations; whereas thecomponent ILA-LDA recommends items that are closer in both taste and travel distance to …,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD),2015,55

Bounded coordinate system indexing for real-time video clip search,Zi Huang; Heng Tao Shen; Jie Shao; Xiaofang Zhou; Bin Cui,Abstract Recently; video clips have become very popular online. The massive influx of videoclips has created an urgent need for video search engines to facilitate retrieving relevantclips. Different from traditional long videos; a video clip is a short video often expressing amoment of significance. Due to the high complexity of video data; efficient video clip searchfrom large databases turns out to be very challenging. We propose a novel video cliprepresentation model called the Bounded Coordinate System (BCS); which is the first singlerepresentative capturing the dominating content and content—changing trends of a videoclip. It summarizes a video clip by a coordinate system; where each of its coordinate axes isidentified by principal component analysis (PCA) and bounded by the range of dataprojections along the axis. The similarity measure of BCS considers the operations of …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2009,55
A unified model for stable and temporal topic detection from social media data,Hongzhi Yin; Bin Cui; Hua Lu; Yuxin Huang; Junjie Yao,Web 2.0 users generate and spread huge amounts of messages in online social media.Such user-generated contents are mixture of temporal topics (eg; breaking events) andstable topics (eg; user interests). Due to their different natures; it is important and useful todistinguish temporal topics from stable topics in social media. However; such adiscrimination is very challenging because the user-generated texts in social media are veryshort in length and thus lack useful linguistic features for precise analysis using traditionalapproaches. In this paper; we propose a novel solution to detect both stable and temporaltopics simultaneously from social media data. Specifically; a unified user-temporal mixturemodel is proposed to distinguish temporal topics from stable topics. To improve this model'sperformance; we design a regularization framework that exploits prior spatial information …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,51

iSky: Efficient and progressive skyline computing in a structured P2P network,Lijiang Chen; Bin Cui; Hua Lu; Linhao Xu; Quanqing Xu,An interesting problem in peer-based data management is efficient support for skylinequeries within a multiattribute space. A skyline query retrieves from a set of multidimensionaldata points a subset of interesting points; compared to which no other points are better.Skyline queries play an important role in multi-criteria decision making and user preferenceapplications. In this paper; we address the skyline computing problem in a structured P2Pnetwork. We exploit the iMinMax (θ) transformation to map high-dimensional data points to 1-dimensional values. All transformed data points are then distributed on a structured P2Pnetwork called BATON; where all peers are virtually organized as a balanced binary searchtree. Subsequently; a progressive algorithm is proposed to compute skyline in the distributedP2P network. Further; we propose an adaptive skyline filtering technique to reduce both …,Distributed Computing Systems; 2008. ICDCS'08. The 28th International Conference on,2008,49
Constrained skyline query processing against distributed data sites,Lijiang Chen; Bin Cui; Hua Lu,The skyline of a multidimensional point set is a subset of interesting points that are notdominated by others. In this paper; we investigate constrained skyline queries in a large-scale unstructured distributed environment; where relevant data are distributed amonggeographically scattered sites. We first propose a partition algorithm that divides all datasites into incomparable groups such that the skyline computations in all groups can beparallelized without changing the final result. We then develop a novel algorithm frameworkcalled PaDSkyline for parallel skyline query processing among partitioned site groups. Wealso employ intragroup optimization and multifiltering technique to improve the skyline queryprocesses within each group. In particular; multiple (local) skyline points are sent togetherwith the query as filtering points; which help identify unqualified local skyline points early …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2011,47
Practical online near-duplicate subsequence detection for continuous video streams,Zi Huang; Heng Tao Shen; Jie Shao; Bin Cui; Xiaofang Zhou,Online video content is surging to an unprecedented level. Massive video publishing andsharing impose heavy demands on online near-duplicate detection for many novel videoapplications. This paper presents an accurate and practical system for online near-duplicatesubsequence detection over continuous video streams. We propose to transform a videostream into a one-dimensional video distance trajectory (VDT) monitoring the continuouschanges of consecutive frames with respect to a reference point; which is further segmentedand represented by a sequence of compact signatures called linear smoothing functions(LSFs). LSFs of each subsequence of the incoming video stream are continuouslygenerated and temporally stored in a buffer for comparison with query LSFs. LSF adoptscompound probability to combine three independent video factors for effective segment …,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,2010,44
Indexing high-dimensional data for efficient in-memory similarity search,Bin Cui; Beng Chin Coi; Jianwen Su; K-L Tan,In main memory systems; the L2 cache typically employs cache line sizes of 32-128 bytes.These values are relatively small compared to high-dimensional data; eg;> 32D. Theconsequence is that existing techniques (on low-dimensional data) that minimize cachemisses are no longer effective. We present a novel index structure; called/spl Delta/-tree; tospeed up the high-dimensional query in main memory environment. The/spl Delta/-tree is amultilevel structure where each level represents the data space at different dimensionalities:the number of dimensions increases toward the leaf level. The remaining dimensions areobtained using principal component analysis. Each level of the tree serves to prune thesearch space more efficiently as the lower dimensions can reduce the distance computationand better exploit the small cache line size. Additionally; the top-down clustering scheme …,IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering,2005,44
Bursty event detection from collaborative tags,Junjie Yao; Bin Cui; Yuxin Huang; Yanhong Zhou,Abstract Collaborative tagging have emerged as a ubiquitous way to annotate and organizeonline resources. As a kind of descriptive keyword; large amount of tags are created andassociated to multiple types of resources; eg; web pages; photos; videos and tweets. Users'tagging actions over time reflect their changing interests. Monitoring and analyzing thetemporal patterns of tags can provide important insights to trace hot topics on the web.Existing work focuses on deriving temporal patterns for individual tags. However; there existremarkable correlations among tags assigned to online resources. In this paper; we proposea new approach to detect bursty tagging event; which captures the relations among a groupof correlated tags where the tags are either bursty or associated with bursty tag co-occurrence. This kind of bursty tagging event generally corresponds to a real life event. It …,World Wide Web,2012,43
Temporal and social context based burst detection from folksonomies,Junjie Yao; Bin Cui Yuxin Huang Xin Jin,Abstract Burst detection is an important topic in temporal stream analysis. Usually; only thetextual features are used in burst detection. In the theme extraction from current prevailingsocial media content; it is necessary to consider not only textual features but also thepervasive collaborative context; eg; resource lifetime and user activity. This paper exploresnovel approaches to combine multiple sources of such indication for better burst extraction.We systematically investigate the characters of collaborative context; ie; metadata frequency;topic coverage and user attractiveness. First; a robust state based model is utilized to detectbursts from individual streams. We then propose a learning method to combine these burstpulses. Experiments on a large real dataset demonstrate the remarkable improvements overthe traditional methods.,Proc. of AAAI,2010,42
Operation-aware buffer management in flash-based systems,Yanfei Lv; Bin Cui; Bingsheng He; Xuexuan Chen,Abstract The inherent asymmetry of read and write speeds of flash memory poses greatchallenges for buffer management design. Most of existing flash-based buffer managementpolicies adopt disk-oriented strategies by giving a specific priority to dirty pages; while notfully exploiting the characteristics of the flash memory. In this paper; we propose a novelbuffer replacement algorithm named FOR; which stands for Flash-based Operation-awarebuffer Replacement. The core idea of FOR is based on novel operation-aware page weightdetermination for buffer replacement. The weight metric not only measures the locality ofread/write operations on a page; but also takes the cost difference of read/write operationsinto account. We further develop an efficient implementation FOR+ with the time complexityof O (1) for each operation.

Parallel subgraph listing in a large-scale graph,Yingxia Shao; Bin Cui; Lei Chen; Lin Ma; Junjie Yao; Ning Xu,Abstract Subgraph listing is a fundamental operation to many graph and network analyses.The problem itself is computationally expensive and is well-studied in centralizedprocessing algorithms. However; the centralized solutions cannot scale well to large graphs.Recently; several parallel approaches are introduced to handle the large graphs.Unfortunately; these parallel approaches still rely on the expensive join operations; thuscannot achieve high performance. In this paper; we design a novel parallel subgraph listingframework; named PSgL. The PSgL iteratively enumerates subgraph instances and solvesthe subgraph listing in a divide-and-conquer fashion. The framework completely relies onthe graph traversal; and avoids the explicit join operation. Moreover; in order to improve itsperformance; we propose several solutions to balance the workload and reduce the size …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2014,36
Multiple feature fusion for social media applications,Bin Cui; Anthony KH Tung; Ce Zhang; Zhe Zhao,Abstract The emergence of social media as a crucial paradigm has posed new challenges tothe research and industry communities; where media are designed to be disseminatedthrough social interaction. Recent literature has noted the generality of multiple features inthe social media environment; such as textual; visual and user information. However; most ofthe studies employ only a relatively simple mechanism to merge the features rather than fullyexploit feature correlation for social media applications. In this paper; we propose a novelapproach to fusing multiple features and their correlations for similarity evaluation.Specifically; we first build a Feature Interaction Graph (FIG) by taking features as nodes andthe correlations between them as edges. Then; we employ a probabilistic model based onMarkov Random Field to describe the graph for similarity measure between multimedia …,Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2010,35

However;extreme sparsity of user-POI matrix creates a severe challenge. To cope with this challenge;we propose a unified probabilistic generative model; Topic-Region Model (TRM); tosimultaneously discover the semantic; temporal and spatial patterns of users' check-inactivities; and to model their joint effect on users' decision-making for POIs. We conductextensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our TRM on two real large-scaledatasets; and the experimental results clearly demonstrate that TRM outperforms the state-of-art methods.,Proceedings of the 23rd ACM international conference on Multimedia,2015,34

In this paper; we address theproblem of automatically recommending groups to users. We propose to simultaneouslyexploit media contents and link structures between users and groups. To this end; wepresent a probabilistic latent topic model to model them in an integrated framework;expecting to jointly discover the latent interests for users and groups and simultaneouslylearn the recommendation function. We demonstrate the proposed approach on the datasetcrawled from Flickr. com.,Information retrieval,2012,34
A novel framework for efficient automated singer identification in large music databases,Jialie Shen; John Shepherd; Bin Cui; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Over the past decade; there has been explosive growth in the availability ofmultimedia data; particularly image; video; and music. Because of this; content-based musicretrieval has attracted attention from the multimedia database and information retrievalcommunities. Content-based music retrieval requires us to be able to automatically identifyparticular characteristics of music data. One such characteristic; useful in a range ofapplications; is the identification of the singer in a musical piece. Unfortunately; existingapproaches to this problem suffer from either low accuracy or poor scalability. In this article;we propose a novel scheme; called Hybrid Singer Identifier (HSI); for efficient automatedsinger recognition. HSI uses multiple low-level features extracted from both vocal andnonvocal music segments to enhance the identification process; it achieves this via a …,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),2009,34
Effective variation management for pseudo periodical streams,Lv-an Tang; Bin Cui; Hongyan Li; Gaoshan Miao; Dongqing Yang; Xinbiao Zhou,Abstract Many database applications require the analysis and processing of data streams. Insuch systems; huge amounts of data arrive rapidly and their values change over time. Thevariations on streams typically imply some fundamental changes of the underlying objectsand possess significant domain meanings. In some data streams; successive events seemto recur in a certain time interval; but the data indeed evolves with tiny differences as timeelapses. This feature is called pseudo periodicity; which poses a non-trivial challenge tovariation management in data streams. This paper presents our research effort in onlinevariation management over such streams; and the idea can be applied to the problemdomain of medical applications; such as patient vital signal monitoring.

Joint modeling of user check-in behaviors for real-time point-of-interest recommendation,Hongzhi Yin; Bin Cui; Xiaofang Zhou; Weiqing Wang; Zi Huang; Shazia Sadiq,Abstract Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation has become an important means to helppeople discover attractive and interesting places; especially when users travel out of town.However; the extreme sparsity of a user-POI matrix creates a severe challenge. To cope withthis challenge; we propose a unified probabilistic generative model; the Topic-Region Model(TRM); to simultaneously discover the semantic; temporal; and spatial patterns of users'check-in activities; and to model their joint effect on users' decision making for selection ofPOIs to visit. To demonstrate the applicability and flexibility of TRM; we investigate how itsupports two recommendation scenarios in a unified way; that is; hometownrecommendation and out-of-town recommendation.

Terec: A temporal recommender system over tweet stream,Chen Chen; Hongzhi Yin; Junjie Yao; Bin Cui,Abstract As social media further integrates into our daily lives; people are increasinglyimmersed in real-time social streams via services such as Twitter and Weibo. One importantobservation in these online social platforms is that users' interests and the popularity oftopics shift very fast; which poses great challenges on existing recommender systems toprovide the right topics at the right time. In this paper; we extend the online rankingtechnique and propose a temporal recommender system-TeRec. In TeRec; when postingtweets; users can get recommendations of topics (hashtags) according to their real-timeinterests; they can also generate fast feedbacks according to the recommendations. TeRecprovides the browser-based client interface which enables the users to access the real timetopic recommendations; and the server side processes and stores the real-time stream …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,28

Among these applications; datamanagement in peer-to-peer systems is one of the interesting domains. In this paper; weinvestigate the multidimensional skyline computation problem on a structured peer-to-peernetwork. In order to achieve low communication cost and quick response time; we utilize theiMinMax (\theta) method to transform high-dimensional data to one-dimensional value anddistribute the data in a structured peer-to-peer network called BATON.

On effective e-mail classification via neural networks,Bin Cui; Anirban Mondal; Jialie Shen; Gao Cong; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract For addressing the growing problem of junk E-mail on the Internet; this paperproposes an effective E-mail classifying and cleansing method in this paper. Incidentally; E-mail messages can be modelled as semi-structured documents consisting of a set of fieldswith pre-defined semantics and a number of variable length free-text fields. Our proposedmethod deals with both fields having pre-defined semantics as well as variable length free-text fields for obtaining higher accuracy. The main contributions of this work are two-fold.First; we present a new model based on the Neural Network (NN) for classifying personal E-mails. In particular; we treat E-mail files as a particular kind of plain text files; the implicationbeing that our feature set is relatively large (since there are thousands of different terms indifferent E-mail files).

Billions of users generate;consume; and spread tons of information every day. This unprecedented scale of dynamicsbecomes invaluable to reflect our zeitgeist. However; most present diffusion extraction workshave only touched individual user level and cannot obtain comprehensive clues. This paperintroduces a new approach; ie; COmmunity Level Diffusion (COLD); to uncover and exploretemporal diffusion. We model topics and communities in a unified latent framework; andextract inter-community influence dynamics. With a well-designed multi-component modelstructure and a parallel inference implementation on GraphLab; the COLD method isexpressive while remaining efficient.,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,27
Keyword query reformulation on structured data,Junjie Yao; Bin Cui; Liansheng Hua; Yuxin Huang,Textual web pages dominate web search engines nowadays. However; there is also astriking increase of structured data on the web. Efficient keyword query processing onstructured data has attracted enough attention; but effective query understanding has yet tobe investigated. In this paper; we focus on the problem of keyword query reformulation in thestructured data scenario. These reformulated queries provide alternative descriptions oforiginal input. They could better capture users' information need and guide users to explorerelated items in the target structured data. We propose an automatic keyword queryreformulation approach by exploiting structural semantics in the underlying structured datasources. The reformulation solution is decomposed into two stages; ie; offline term relationextraction and online query generation. We first utilize a heterogenous graph to model the …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on,2012,26
Exploring bit-difference for approximate knn search in high-dimensional databases,Bin Cui; Heng Tao Shen; Jialie Shen; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract In this paper; we develop a novel index structure to support efficient approximate k-nearest neighbor (KNN) query in high-dimensional databases. In high-dimensional spaces;the computational cost of the distance (eg; Euclidean distance) between two pointscontributes a dominant portion of the overall query response time for memory processing. Toreduce the distance computation; we first propose a structure (BID) using BIt-Difference toanswer approximate KNN query. The BID employs one bit to represent each feature vectorof point and the number of bit-difference is used to prune the further points. To facilitate realdataset which is typically skewed; we enhance the BID mechanism with clustering; clusteradapted bitcoder and dimensional weight; named the BID+. Extensive experiments areconducted to show that our proposed method yields significant performance advantages …,Proceedings of the 16th Australasian database conference-Volume 39,2005,25
Finding top-k local users in geo-tagged social media data,Jinling Jiang; Hua Lu; Bin Yang; Bin Cui,Social network platforms and location-based services are increasingly popular in people'sdaily lives. The combination of them results in location-based social media where peopleare connected not only through the friendship in the social network but also by theirgeographical locations in reality. This duality makes it possible to query and make use ofsocial media data in novel ways. In this work; we formulate a novel and useful problemcalled top-k local user search (TkLUS for short) from tweets with geo-tags. Given a locationq; a distance r; and a set of keywords W; the TkLUS query finds the top-k users who haveposted tweets relevant to the desired keywords in W at a place within the distance r from q.TkLUS queries are useful in many application scenarios such as friend recommendation;spatial decision; etc. We design a set of techniques to answer such queries efficiently …,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on,2015,24
Adapting to user interest drift for poi recommendation,Hongzhi Yin; Xiaofang Zhou; Bin Cui; Hao Wang; Kai Zheng; Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen,Point-of-Interest recommendation is an essential means to help people discover attractivelocations; especially when people travel out of town or to unfamiliar regions. While agrowing line of research has focused on modeling user geographical preferences for POIrecommendation; they ignore the phenomenon of user interest drift across geographicalregions; ie; users tend to have different interests when they travel in different regions; whichdiscounts the recommendation quality of existing methods; especially for out-of-town users.In this paper; we propose a latent class probabilistic generative model Spatial-TemporalLDA (ST-LDA) to learn region-dependent personal interests according to the contents oftheir checked-in POIs at each region. As the users' check-in records left in the out-of-townregions are extremely sparse; ST-LDA incorporates the crowd's preferences by …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2016,23
Main memory indexing: the case for BD-tree,Bin Cui; Beng Chin Ooi; Jianwen Su; K-L Tan,We adapt and optimize the BD-tree for main memory data processing. We compare thememory-based BD-tree against the B/sup+/-tree and CSB/sup+/-tree. We present costmodels for exact match query for these indexes; including L2 cache and translationlookahead buffer (TLB) miss model and execution time model. We also implemented thesestructures and conducted experimental study. Our analytical and experimental results showthat a well-tuned BD-tree is superior in most cases.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2004,23
Page: a partition aware engine for parallel graph computation,Yingxia Shao; Bin Cui; Lin Ma,Graph partition quality affects the overall performance of parallel graph computationsystems. The quality of a graph partition is measured by the balance factor and edge cutratio. A balanced graph partition with small edge cut ratio is generally preferred since itreduces the expensive network communication cost. However; according to an empiricalstudy on Giraph; the performance over well partitioned graph might be even two times worsethan simple random partitions. This is because these systems only optimize for the simplepartition strategies and cannot efficiently handle the increasing workload of local messageprocessing when a high quality graph partition is used. In this paper; we propose a novelpartition aware graph computation engine named PAGE; which equips a new messageprocessor and a dynamic concurrency control model. The new message processor …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,21
LogGP: a log-based dynamic graph partitioning method,Ning Xu; Lei Chen; Bin Cui,Abstract With the increasing availability and scale of graph data from Web 2.0; graphpartitioning becomes one of efficient preprocessing techniques to balance the computingworkload. Since the cost of partitioning the entire graph is strictly prohibitive; there are somerecent tentative works towards streaming graph partitioning which can run faster; be easilyparalleled; and be incrementally updated. Unfortunately; the experiments show that therunning time of each partitioning is still unbalanced due to the variation of workload accesspattens during the supersteps. In addition; the one-pass streaming partitioning result is notalways satisfactory for the algorithms' local view of the graph.

Towards efficient automated singer identification in large music databases,Jialie Shen; Bin Cui; John Shepherd; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Automated singer identification is important in organising; browsing and retrievingdata in large music databases. In this paper; we propose a novel scheme; called HybridSinger Identifier (HSI); for automated singer recognition. HSI can effectively use multiple low-level features extracted from both vocal and non-vocal music segments to enhance theidentification process with a hybrid architecture and build profiles of individual singercharacteristics based on statistical mixture models. Extensive experimental resultsconducted on a large music database demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches.,Proceedings of the 29th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval,2006,20
Heterogeneous environment aware streaming graph partitioning,Ning Xu; Bin Cui; Lei Chen; Zi Huang; Yingxia Shao,With the increasing availability of graph data and widely adopted cloud computingparadigm; graph partitioning has become an efficient pre-processing technique to balancethe computing workload and cope with the large scale of input data. Since the cost ofpartitioning the entire graph is strictly prohibitive; there are some recent tentative workstowards streaming graph partitioning which run faster; are easily parallelized; and can beincrementally updated. Most of the existing works on streaming partitioning assume thatworker nodes within a cluster are homogeneous in nature. Unfortunately; this assumptiondoes not always hold. Experiments show that these homogeneous algorithms suffer asignificant performance degradation when running at heterogeneous environment. In thispaper; we propose a novel adaptive streaming graph partitioning approach to cope with …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2015,19
Log-compact R-tree: an efficient spatial index for SSD,Yanfei Lv; Jing Li; Bin Cui; Xuexuan Chen,Abstract R-Tree structure is widely adopted as a general spatial index with the assumptionthat the deployed system is equipped with magnetic hard disk. While the application of SSDbecomes more and more popular; traditional optimization of R-Tree structure on SSD ismuch less desirable than that on magnetic hard disk. Existing flash-aware index approachesemploy log mechanism to reduce random writes at a cost of large amount of read. A novelindex named Log Compact R-Tree (LCR-tree) is proposed in this paper. Distinguished fromprevious attempts; compacted log is introduced to combine newly arrival log with origin oneson the same node; which renders great decrement of random writes with at most oneadditional read for each node access. Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposedLCR-Tree can achieve up to 3 times benefit against existing approaches.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2011,18
Content-enriched classifier for web video classification,Bin Cui; Ce Zhang; Gao Cong,Abstract With the explosive growth of online videos; automatic real-time categorization ofWeb videos plays a key role for organizing; browsing and retrieving the huge amount ofvideos on the Web. Previous work shows that; in addition to text features; content features ofvideos are also useful for Web video classification. Unfortunately; extracting content featuresis computationally prohibitive for real-time video classification. In this paper we propose anovel video classification framework that is able to exploit both content and text features forvideo classification while avoiding the expensive computation of extracting content featuresat classification time. The main idea of our approach is to utilize the content featuresextracted from training data to enrich the text based semantic kernels; yielding content-enriched semantic kernels.

Exploring composite acoustic features for efficient music similarity query,Bin Cui; Jialie Shen; Gao Cong; Heng Tao Shen; Cui Yu,Abstract Music similarity query based on acoustic content is becoming important with theever-increasing growth of the music information from emerging applications such as digitallibraries and WWW. However; relative techniques are still in their infancy and much lessthan satisfactory. In this paper; we present a novel index structure; called Composite Featuretree; CF-tree; to facilitate efficient content-based music search adopting multiple musicalfeatures. Before constructing the tree structure; we use PCA to transform the extractedfeatures into a new space sorted by the importance of acoustic features. The CF-tree is abalanced multi-way tree structure where each level represents the data space at differentdimensionalities. The PCA transformed data and reduced dimensions in the upper levelscan alleviate suffering from dimensionality curse.

Quest: querying music databases by acoustic and textual features,Bin Cui; Ling Liu; Calton Pu; Jialie Shen; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract With continued growth of music content available on the Internet; music informationretrieval has attracted increasing attention. An important challenge for music searching is itsability to support both keyword and content based queries efficiently and with high precision.In this paper; we present a music query system-QueST (Query by acouStic and Textualfeatures) to support both keyword and content based retrieval in large music databases.QueST has two distinct features. First; it provides new index schemes that can efficientlyhandle various queries within a uniform architecture. Concretely; we propose a hybridstructure consisting of Inverted file and Signature file to support keyword search. For contentbased query; we introduce the notion of similarity to capture various music semantics likemelody and genre.

An efficient similarity search framework for simrank over large dynamic graphs,Yingxia Shao; Bin Cui; Lei Chen; Mingming Liu; Xing Xie,Abstract SimRank is an important measure of vertex-pair similarity according to the structureof graphs. The similarity search based on SimRank is an important operation for identifyingsimilar vertices in a graph and has been employed in many data analysis applications.Nowadays; graphs in the real world become much larger and more dynamic. The existingsolutions for similarity search are expensive in terms of time and space cost. None of themcan efficiently support similarity search over large dynamic graphs. In this paper; we proposea novel two-stage random-walk sampling framework (TSF) for SimRank-based similaritysearch (eg; top-k search). In the preprocessing stage; TSF samples a set of one-way graphsto index raw random walks in a novel manner within O (NR g) time and space; where N isthe number of vertices and R g is the number of one-way graphs.

Correlation-based retrieval for heavily changed near-duplicate videos,Jiajun Liu; Zi Huang; Heng Tao Shen; Bin Cui,Abstract The unprecedented and ever-growing number of Web videos nowadays leads tothe massive existence of near-duplicate videos. Very often; some near-duplicate videosexhibit great content changes; while the user perceives little information change; forexample; color features change significantly when transforming a color video with a bluefilter. These feature changes contribute to low-level video similarity computations; makingconventional similarity-based near-duplicate video retrieval techniques incapable ofaccurately capturing the implicit relationship between two near-duplicate videos with fairlylarge content modifications. In this paper; we introduce a new dimension for near-duplicatevideo retrieval. Different from existing near-duplicate video retrieval approaches which arebased on video-content similarity; we explore the correlation between two videos.

Range top/bottom k queries in OLAP sparse data cubes,Zhong Wei Luo; Tok Wang Ling; Chuan Heng Ang; Sin Yeung Lee; Bin Cui,Abstract A range top k query finds the top k maximum values over all selected cells of anOLAP data cube where the selection is specified by the range of contiguous values for eachdimension. In this paper; we propose a partitionbased storage structure; which is capable ofanswering both range top and bottom k queries in OLAP sparse data cubes. This isachieved by partitioning a multi-dimensional sparse data cube and storing it in partition-major order into two one-dimensional arrays: one is for the dense partitions and the otherone is for the sparse partitions. This algorithm supports both single cell update and bulkbatch update. Nevertheless; the update cost for a set of cells in a partition is similar to theupdate cost of a single cell update; ie extra 2 I/Os in the most cases and the worst is extra 5I/Os in some very rare cases. Our approach also reduces the storage cost of sparse data …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2001,15
A multi-source integration framework for user occupation inference in social media systems,Yanxiang Huang; Lele Yu; Xiang Wang; Bin Cui,Abstract With the rapid development of social media applications; lots of users areconnected with friends online; and their daily life and opinions are recorded. Social mediaprovides us an unprecedented way to collect and analyze billions of users' information.Proper user attribute identification or profile inference becomes increasingly attractive andfeasible. However; the flourishing social records also pose great challenge in effectivefeature selection and integration for user profile inference; which is mainly caused by the textdiversity and complex community structures. In this paper; we propose a comprehensiveframework to infer the user occupation from his/her social activities recorded in the micro-blog system; which is a multi-source integration framework that combines both content andnetwork information.

Exploiting matrix dependency for efficient distributed matrix computation,Lele Yu; Yingxia Shao; Bin Cui,Abstract Distributed matrix computation is a popular approach for many large-scale dataanalysis and machine learning tasks. However existing distributed matrix computationsystems generally incur heavy communication cost during the runtime; which degrades theoverall performance. In this paper; we propose a novel matrix computation system; namedDMac; which exploits the matrix dependencies in matrix programs for efficient matrixcomputation in the distributed environment. We decompose each matrix program into asequence of operations; and reveal the matrix dependencies between operations in theprogram. We next design a dependency-oriented cost model to select an optimal executionstrategy for each operation; and generate a communication efficient execution plan for thematrix computation program.

Compacting music signatures for efficient music retrieval,Bin Cui; HV Jagadish; Beng Chin Ooi; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract Music information retrieval is becoming very important with the ever-increasinggrowth of music content in digital libraries; peer-to-peer systems and the internet. While it iseasy to quantize music into a discrete string representation; retrieval by content requires(approximate) sub-string matching; which is hard. In this paper; we present a novel system;called MUSIG; that uses compact MUsic SIGnatures for efficient contentbased musicretrieval. The signature is computed as follows:(a) each music file is split into a set of(overlapping) segments;(b) similar segments are clustered together; the number of clusterscorresponds to the number of dimensions;(c) for each music file; the number of its segmentsthat fall into a cluster determines the key value in that dimension.,Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Extending database technology: Advances in database technology,2008,14
Heterogeneity-aware distributed parameter servers,Jiawei Jiang; Bin Cui; Ce Zhang; Lele Yu,Abstract We study distributed machine learning in heterogeneous environments in this work.We first conduct a systematic study of existing systems running distributed stochasticgradient descent; we find that; although these systems work well in homogeneousenvironments; they can suffer performance degradation; sometimes up to 10x; inheterogeneous environments where stragglers are common because their synchronizationprotocols cannot fit a heterogeneous setting. Our first contribution is a heterogeneity-awarealgorithm that uses a constant learning rate schedule for updates before adding them to theglobal parameter. This allows us to suppress stragglers' harm on robust convergence. As afurther improvement; our second contribution is a more sophisticated learning rate schedulethat takes into consideration the delayed information of each update.

Efficient cohesive subgraphs detection in parallel,Yingxia Shao; Lei Chen; Bin Cui,Abstract A cohesive subgraph is a primary vehicle for massive graph analysis; and a newlyintroduced cohesive subgraph; k-truss; which is motivated by a natural observation of socialcohesion; has attracted more and more attention. However; the existing parallel solutions toidentify the k-truss are inefficient for very large graphs; as they still suffer from hugecommunication cost and large number of iterations during the computation. In this paper; wepropose a novel parallel and efficient truss detection algorithm; called PeTa. The PeTaproduces a triangle complete subgraph (TC-subgraph) for every computing node. Based onthe TC-subgraphs; PeTa can detect the local k-truss in parallel within a few iterations. Wetheoretically prove; within this new paradigm; the communication cost of PeTa is bounded bythree times of the number of triangles; the total computation complexity of PeTa is the …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2014,12
Page: A partition aware graph computation engine,Yingxia Shao; Junjie Yao; Bin Cui; Lin Ma,Abstract Graph partitioning is one of the key components in parallel graph computation; andthe partition quality significantly affects the overall computing performance. In the existinggraph computing systems;``good''partition schemes are preferred as they have smaller edgecut ratio and hence reduce the communication cost among working nodes. However; in anempirical study on Giraph [1]; we found that the performance over well partitioned graphmight be even two times worse than simple partitions. The cause is that the local messageprocessing cost in graph computing systems may surpass the communication cost in severalcases. In this paper; we analyse the cost of parallel graph computing systems as well as therelationship between the cost and underlying graph partitioning. Based on theseobservation; we propose a novel Partition Aware Graph computation Engine named …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,12

The maindifficulty lies in its high complexity of maintenance aroused by the exact model definition ofclosed itemsets and the dynamic changing of data streams. In data stream scenario; it issufficient to mining only approximated frequent closed itemsets instead of in full precision.Such a compact but close-enough frequent itemset is called a relaxed frequent closeditemsets. In this paper; we first introduce the concept of RC (Relaxed frequent ClosedItemsets); which is the generalized form of approximation.

A framework for similarity search of time series cliques with natural relations,Bin Cui; Zhe Zhao; Wee Hyong Tok,A Time Series Clique (TSC) consists of multiple time series which are related to each otherby natural relations. The natural relations that are found between the time series depend onthe application domains. For example; a TSC can consist of time series which aretrajectories in video that have spatial relations. In conventional time series retrieval; suchnatural relations between the time series are not considered. In this paper; we formalize theproblem of similarity search over a TSC database. We develop a novel framework forefficient similarity search on TSC data. The framework addresses the following issues. First;it provides a compact representation for TSC data. Second; it uses a multidimensionalrelation vector to capture the natural relations between the multiple time series in a TSC.Lastly; the framework defines a novel similarity measure that uses the compact …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2012,11
Finding a wise group of experts in social networks,Hongzhi Yin; Bin Cui; Yuxin Huang,Abstract Given a task T; a pool of experts χ with different skills; and a social network G thatcaptures social relationships and various interactions among these experts; we study theproblem of finding a wise group of experts χ'; a subset of χ; to perform the task. We call thisthe Expert Group Formation problem in this paper. In order to reduce various potential socialinfluence among team members and avoid following the crowd; we require that themembers of χ'not only meet the skill requirements of the task; but also be diverse. To quantifythe diversity of a group of experts; we propose one metric based on the social influenceincurred by the subgraph in G that only involves χ'. We analyze the problem of DiverseExpert Group Formation and show that it is NP-hard.

Inthis paper; we propose an efficient in-memory processing of continuous queries on themoving object streams. We model moving objects using function of time and use it in theprediction of usefulness of objects with respect to the continuous queries. To effectivelyutilize the limited memory; we derive several replacement policies to discard objects that areof no potential interest to the queries and design efficient algorithms with light datastructures.

Evolutionary taxonomy construction from dynamic tag space,Junjie Yao; Bin Cui; Gao Cong; Yuxin Huang,Abstract Collaborative tagging becomes a common feature of current web sites; facilitatingordinary users to annotate and represent online resources. The large collection of tags andtheir relationships form a tag space. In this kind of tag space; the popularity and correlationamongst tags capture the current social interests. Tags are freely chosen keywords anddifficult to organize. As a hierarchical concept structure to represent the subsumptionrelationships; automatically extracted taxonomies become a viable method to managecollaborative tags. However; tags change over time; and it is also imperative to incorporatethe temporal tag evolution into the extracted taxonomies. In this paper; we formalize theproblem of evolutionary taxonomy generation over a large collection of tags. A line oftaxonomies are generated to reflect the temporal changes of underlying tag space.

Evolutionary taxonomy construction from dynamic tag space,Bin Cui; Junjie Yao; Gao Cong; Yuxin Huang,Abstract Collaborative tagging allows users to tag online resources. We refer to the largedatabase of tags and their relationships as a tag space.

Accelerating sequence searching: dimensionality reduction method,Guojie Song; Bin Cui; Baihua Zheng; Kunqing Xie; Dongqing Yang,Abstract Similarity search over long sequence dataset becomes increasingly popular inmany emerging applications; such as text retrieval; genetic sequences exploring; etc. In thispaper; a novel index structure; namely Sequence Embedding Multiset tree (SEM− tree); hasbeen proposed to speed up the searching process over long sequences. The SEM-tree is amulti-level structure where each level represents the sequence data with differentcompression level of multiset; and the length of multiset increases towards the leaf levelwhich contains original sequences. The multisets; obtained using sequence embeddingalgorithms; have the desirable property that they do not need to keep the character order inthe sequence; ie shorter representation; but can reserve the majority of distance informationof sequences.

Indexing and integrating multiple features for www images,Heng Tao Shen; Xiaofang Zhou; Bin Cui,Abstract In this paper; we present a novel indexing technique called Multi-scale SimilarityIndexing (MSI) to index image's multi-features into a single one-dimensional structure. Bothfor text and visual feature spaces; the similarity between a point and a local partition's centerin individual space is used as the indexing key; where similarity values in different featuresare distinguished by different scale. Then a single indexing tree can be built on these keys.Based on the property that relevant images have similar similarity values from the center ofthe same local partition in any feature space; certain number of irrelevant images can be fastpruned based on the triangle inequity on indexing keys. To remove the “dimensionalitycurse” existing in high dimensional structure; we propose a new technique called Local BitStream (LBS).

Towards optimal utilization of main memory for moving object indexing,Bin Cui; Dan Lin; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract In moving object databases; existing disk-based indexes are unable to keep up withthe high update rate while providing speedy retrieval at the same time. However; efficientmanagement of moving-object database can be achieved through aggressive use of mainmemory. In this paper; we propose an Integrated Memory Partitioning and Activity ConsciousTwin-index (IMPACT) framework where the moving object database is indexed by a pair ofindexes based on the properties of the objects' movement–a main-memory structuremanages active objects while a disk-based index handles inactive objects. As objectsbecome active (or inactive); they dynamically migrate from one structure to the other.Moreover; the main memory is also organized into two partitions–one for the main memoryindex; and the other as buffers for the frequently accessed nodes of the disk-based index …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2005,10

Effective skyline cardinality estimation on data streams,Yang Lu; Jiakui Zhao; Lijun Chen; Bin Cui; Dongqing Yang,Abstract In order to incorporate the skyline operator into the data stream engine; we need toaddress the problem of skyline cardinality estimation; which is very important for extendingthe query optimizer's cost model to accommodate skyline queries. In this paper; we proposerobust approaches for estimating the skyline cardinality over sliding windows in the streamenvironment. We first design an approach to estimate the skyline cardinality over uniformlydistributed data; and then extend the approach to support arbitrarily distributed data. Ourapproaches allow arbitrary data distribution; hence can be applied to extend the optimizer'scost model. To estimate the skyline cardinality in online manner; the live elements in thesliding window are sketched using Spectral Bloom Filters which can efficiently andeffectively capture the information which is essential for estimating the skyline cardinality …,International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications,2008,9

Angel: a new large-scale machine learning system,Jie Jiang; Lele Yu; Jiawei Jiang; Yuhong Liu; Bin Cui,Abstract Machine Learning (ML) techniques now are ubiquitous tools to extract structuralinformation from data collections. With the increasing volume of data; large-scale MLapplications require an efficient implementation to accelerate the performance. Existingsystems parallelize algorithms through either data parallelism or model parallelism. But dataparallelism cannot obtain good statistical efficiency due to the conflicting updates toparameters while the performance is damaged by global barriers in model parallel methods.In this paper; we propose a new system; named Angel; to facilitate the development of large-scale ML applications in production environment. By allowing concurrent updates to modelacross different groups and scheduling the updates in each group; Angel can achieve agood balance between hardware efficiency and statistical efficiency.

Tornado: A system for real-time iterative analysis over evolving data,Xiaogang Shi; Bin Cui; Yingxia Shao; Yunhai Tong,Abstract There is an increasing demand for real-time iterative analysis over evolving data. Inthis paper; we propose a novel execution model to obtain timely results at given instants. Wenotice that a loop starting from a good initial guess usually converges fast. Hence weorganize the execution of iterative methods over evolving data into a main loop and severalbranch loops. The main loop is responsible for the gathering of inputs and maintains theapproximation to the timely results. When the results are requested by a user; a branch loopis forked from the main loop and iterates until convergence to produce the results. Using theapproximation of the main loop; the branch loops can start from a place near the fixed-pointand converge quickly. Since the inputs not reflected in the approximation is concerned withthe approximation error; we develop a novel bounded asynchronous iteration model to …,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,8
Distributed cache indexing for efficient subspace skyline computation in p2p networks,Lijiang Chen; Bin Cui; Linhao Xu; Heng Tao Shen,Abstract Skyline queries play an important role in applications such as multi-criteria decisionmaking and user preference systems. Recently; more attention has been paid to the problemof efficient skyline computation in the P2P systems. Due to the high distribution of the P2Pnetworks; the skyline computation incurs too many intermediate results transferred betweenpeers; which consumes mass of the network bandwidth. Additionally; a large number ofpeers are involved in the skyline computation; which introduces both heavy communicationcost and computational overhead. In this paper; we propose a novel Distributed CachingMechanism (DCM) to efficiently improve the performance of the skyline calculation in thestructured P2P networks; using a Distributed Caching Index (DCI) scheme and an advancedcache utilization strategy. The DCI scheme is employed to efficiently locate the cache that …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,8
Towards unified ad-hoc data processing,Xiaogang Shi; Bin Cui; Gillian Dobbie; Beng Chin Ooi,Abstract It is important to provide efficient execution for ad-hoc data processing programs. Incontrast to constructing complex declarative queries; many users prefer to write theirprograms using procedural code with simple queries. As many users are not expertprogrammers; their programs usually exhibit poor performance in practice and it is achallenge to automatically optimize these programs and efficiently execute the programs. Inthis paper; we present UniAD; a system designed to simplify the programming of dataprocessing tasks and provide efficient execution for user programs. We propose a novelintermediate representation named UniQL which utilizes HOQs to describe the operationsperformed in programs. By combining both procedural and declarative logics; we canperform various optimizations across the boundary between procedural and declarative …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2014,7

In this paper; we investigate the problem ofinformation retrieval in a mobile peer-to-peer network. The prevailing approach toinformation retrieval is to apply flooding methods because of its quick response and easymaintenance. Obviously; this kind of approach wastes a huge amount of communicationbandwidth which greatly affects the availability of the network; and the battery power whichsignificantly shortens the serving time of mobile devices in the network. To tackle thisproblem; we propose a novel approach by mimicking different human behaviors of socialnetworks; which takes advantages of Intelligence Accuracy (IA) mechanism that evaluates …,Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management,2009,7
Indexing text and visual features for WWW images,Heng Tao Shen; Xiaofang Zhou; Bin Cui,Abstract In this paper; we present a novel indexing technique called Multi-scale SimilarityIndexing (MSI) to index image's multi-features into a single one-dimensional structure. Bothfor text and visual feature spaces; the similarity between a point and a local partition's centerin individual space is used as the indexing key; where similarity values in different featuresare distinguished by different scale. Then a single indexing tree can be built on these keys.Based on the property that relevant images haves similar similarity values from the center ofthe same local partition in any feature space; certain number of irrelevant images can be fastpruned based on the triangle inequity on indexing keys. To remove the “dimensionalitycurse” existing in high dimensional structure; we propose a new technique called Local BitStream (LBS).

Adaptive quantization of the high-dimensional data for efficient knn processing,Bin Cui; Jing Hu; Hengtao Shen; Cui Yu,Abstract In this paper; we present a novel index structure; called the SA-tree; to speed upprocessing of high-dimensional K-nearest neighbor (KNN) queries. The SA-tree employsdata clustering and compression; ie utilizes the characteristics of each cluster to adaptivelycompress feature vectors into bit-strings. Hence our proposed mechanism can reduce thedisk I/O and computational cost significantly; and adapt to different data distributions. Wealso develop efficient KNN search algorithms using MinMax Pruning and Partial MinDistPruning methods. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the SA-tree and theresults show that our approaches provide superior performance.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2004,7

Community specific temporal topic discovery from social media,Zhiting Hu; Chong Wang; Junjie Yao; Eric Xing; Hongzhi Yin; Bin Cui,Abstract: Studying temporal dynamics of topics in social media is very useful to understandonline user behaviors. Most of the existing work on this subject usually monitors the globaltrends; ignoring variation among communities. Since users from different communities tendto have varying tastes and interests; capturing community-level temporal change canimprove the understanding and management of social content. Additionally; it can furtherfacilitate the applications such as community discovery; temporal prediction and onlinemarketing. However; this kind of extraction becomes challenging due to the intricateinteractions between community and topic; and intractable computational complexity.

The huge number of discovered frequent patterns pose great challenge forusers to explore and understand them. It is desirable to accurately summarizing the set offrequent patterns into a small number of patterns or profiles so that users can easily explorethem. In this paper; we employ a probability model to represent a set of frequent patternsand give two methods of estimating the support of a pattern from the model.

Diagonal Ordering: A new approach to high-dimensional KNN processing,Jing Hu; Bin Cui; Hengtao Shen,Abstract In this paper; we propose Diagonal Ordering; a new technique for K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) search in a high-dimensional space. Our solution is based on dataclustering and a particular sort order of the data points; which is obtained by" slicing" eachcluster along the diagonal direction. In this way; we are able to transform the high-dimensional data points into one-dimensional space and index them using a B+-treestructure. KNN search is then performed as a sequence of one-dimensional range searches.Advantages of our approach include:(1) irrelevant data points are eliminated quickly withoutextensive distance computations;(2) the index structure can effectively adapt to different datadistributions;(3) on-line query answering is supported; which is a natural byproduct of theiterative searching algorithm.

We focus on efficiently calculating SimRank; which has been studiedintensively over the last decade. This has led to many algorithms that efficiently calculate orapproximate SimRank being proposed by researchers. Despite these abundant researchefforts; there is no systematic comparison of these algorithms. In this paper; we conduct astudy to compare these algorithms to understand their pros and cons. We first introduce ataxonomy for different algorithms that calculate SimRank and classify each algorithm intoone of the following three classes; namely; iterative-; non-iterative-; and random walk-basedmethod. We implement ten algorithms published from 2002 to 2015; and compare themusing synthetic and real-world graphs. To ensure the fairness of our study; our …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2017,5

Achieving effective multi-term queries for fast DHT information retrieval,Quanqing Xu; Heng Tao Shen; Yafei Dai; Bin Cui; Xiaofang Zhou,Abstract Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) are well-suited for exact match look-ups usingunique identifiers; but do not directly support multi-term queries. Related research of queryexpansion has shown that adding new terms to a query via ad hoc feedback improves theretrieval effectiveness of such query. In the paper; we propose an effective multi-term queryprocessing algorithm for information retrieval in DHT systems. Given the significance of firstterm in a multi-term query; the query is sent to the peers containing the first term. To enhancethe query effectiveness; we design two query expansion mechanisms and an implicitrelevance feedback approach based on users' behaviors. Additionally; we record the querylog and the expansion terms for each query which can accelerate the future queries andimprove the query accuracy.

Survey on query processing based on uncertain data [J],Bin CUI; Yang LU,Uncertain data is inherent in some important application fields; such as sensor networks andmobile object tracking. Using traditional querying methods on uncertain data will bias theanswer set; and hence cannot satisfy users' needs. Therefore; query processing based onuncertain data has attracted more and more attention. Different from queries on certain data;research work on uncertain data introduce probability into data model to measure thelikeness of an uncertain object as one element of the answer set. Due to different problemdefinitions and data models; query types differentiate from each other greatly.

IMPACT: A twin-index framework for efficient moving object query processing,Bin Cui; Dan Lin; Kian-Lee Tan,Abstract With the rapid advancement in wireless communications and positioningtechniques; it is now feasible to track the positions of moving objects. However; existingindexes and associated algorithms; which are usually disk-based; are unable to keep upwith the high update rate while providing speedy retrieval at the same time. Since mainmemory is much faster than disk; efficient management of moving-object database can beachieved through aggressive use of main memory. In this paper; we propose an integratedmemory partitioning and activity conscious twin-index (IMPACT) framework where themoving object database is indexed by a pair of indexes based on the properties of theobjects' movement—a main-memory structure manages active objects while a disk-basedindex handles inactive objects. As objects become active (or inactive); they dynamically …,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2006,5

However; the unbalanced distribution in real data streams poses greatchallenges to existing algorithms. To enhance these algorithms; we propose a meta-framework; called Cold Filter (CF); that enables faster and more accurate stream processing.Different from existing filters that mainly focus on hot items; our filter captures cold items inthe first stage; and hot items in the second stage. Also; existing filters require two-directioncommunication–with frequent exchanges between the two stages; our filter on the otherhand is one-direction–each item enters one stage at most once. Our filter can accuratelyestimate both cold and hot items; giving it a genericity that makes it applicable to many …,Proc. SIGMOD,2018,4

Fast parallel path concatenation for graph extraction,Yingxia Shao; Kai Lei; Lei Chen; Zi Huang; Bin Cui; Zhongyi Liu; Yunhai Tong; Jin Xu,Heterogeneous graph is a popular data model to represent the real-world relations withabundant semantics. To analyze heterogeneous graphs; an important step is extractinghomogeneous graphs from the heterogeneous graphs; called homogeneous graphextraction. In an extracted homogeneous graph; the relation is defined by a line pattern onthe heterogeneous graph and the new attribute values of the relation are calculated by user-defined aggregate functions. The key challenges of the extraction problem are how toefficiently enumerate paths matched by the line pattern and aggregate values for each pairof vertices from the matched paths.

Pgg: An online pattern based approach for stream variation management,Lu-An Tang; Bin Cui; Hong-Yan Li; Gao-Shan Miao; Dong-Qing Yang; Xin-Biao Zhou,Abstract Many database applications require efficient processing of data streams with valuevariations and fluctuant sampling frequency. The variations typically imply fundamentalfeatures of the stream and important domain knowledge of underlying objects. In some datastreams; successive events seem to recur in a certain time interval; but the data indeedevolves with tiny diffeerences as time elapses. This feature; so called pseudo periodicity;poses a new challenge to stream variation management. This study focuses on the onlinemanagement for variations over such streams.

TencentBoost: a gradient boosting tree system with parameter server,Jie Jiang; Jiawei Jiang; Bin Cui; Ce Zhang,Gradient boosting tree (GBT); a widely used machine learning algorithm; achieves state-of-the-art performance in academia; industry; and data analytics competitions. Althoughexisting scalable systems which implement GBT; such as XGBoost and MLlib; perform wellfor datasets with medium-dimensional features; they can suffer performance degradation formany industrial applications where the trained datasets contain highdimensional features.The performance degradation derives from their inefficient mechanisms for modelaggregation—either mapreduce or all-reduce. To address this high-dimensional problem;we propose a scalable execution plan using the parameter server architecture to facilitatethe model aggregation. Further; we introduce a sparse-pull method and an efficient indexstructure to increase the processing speed.

A probabilistic data replacement strategy for flash-based hybrid storage system,Yanfei Lv; Xuexuan Chen; Guangyu Sun; Bin Cui,Abstract Currently; the popularization of flash memory is still limited by its high price and lowcapacity. Thus; the magnetic disk and flash memory will coexist over a long period of time.How to design an effective flash-hard disk hybrid storage system emerges as a critical issue.Most of the existing works are designed based on traditional cache managementapproaches by taking the characteristics of flash into consideration. In this paper; we revisitthe existing hybrid storage approaches and propose a novel probabilistic data replacementstrategy for flash-based hybrid storage system; named HyPro. Different from traditionaldeterministic approaches; our approach moves the data probabilistically based on the dataaccess pattern. Such a method can statistically achieve a good performance over massivememory operations of modern workloads. We also present the detailed data replacement …,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2013,2
ISIS: a new approach for efficient similarity search in sparse databases,Bin Cui; Jiakui Zhao; Gao Cong,Abstract High-dimensional sparse data is prevalent in many real-life applications. In thispaper; we propose a novel index structure for accelerating similarity search in high-dimensional sparse databases; named ISIS; which stands for I ndexing S parse databasesusing I nverted file S. ISIS clusters a dataset and converts the original high-dimensionalspace into a new space where each dimension represents a cluster; furthermore; the keyvalues in the new space are used by Inverted-files indexes. We also propose an extensionof ISIS; named ISIS+; which partitions the data space into lower dimensional subspaces andclusters the data within each subspace.

Squeezing long sequence data for efficient similarity search,Guojie Song; Bin Cui; Baihua Zheng; Kunqing Xie; Dongqing Yang,Abstract Similarity search over long sequence dataset becomes increasingly popular inmany emerging applications. In this paper; a novel index structure; namely SequenceEmbedding Multiset tree (SEM-tree); has been proposed to speed up the searching processover long sequences. The SEM-tree is a multi-level structure where each level representsthe sequence data with different compression level of multiset; and the length of multisetincreases towards the leaf level which contains original sequences. The multisets; obtainedusing sequence embedding algorithms; have the desirable property that they do not need tokeep the character order in the sequence; ie shorter representation; but can reserve themajority of distance information of sequences. Each level of the tree serves to prune thesearch space more efficiently as the multisets utilize the predicability to finish the …,Asia-Pacific Web Conference,2008,2

Abc: a practicable sketch framework for non-uniform multisets,Junzhi Gong; Tong Yang; Yang Zhou; Dongsheng Yang; Shigang Chen; Bin Cui; Xiaoming Li,Abstract—Sketch is a data structure used to record frequencies of items in a multiset; whichis widely used in data streams; data graph; distributed datasets processing; etc. It works withsmall memory usage and a high speed at the cost of a slight inaccuracy. In practice;frequencies of items in many datasets are nonuniformly distributed. Unfortunately; existingsketches can hardly work well on non-uniform datasets. To address this issue; we propose anew sketch framework; namely ABC framework; which can be applied to most existingsketches and can significantly improve the accuracy on non-uniform datasets. The key ideabehind our framework is that when a counter overflows; it makes use of the space from theadjacent counters by operations of bits-borrowing and combination. Extensive experimentalresults show that our ABC framework improves the accuracy by 4.10 times and 4.49 times …,IEEE Bigdata,2017,1
Distinguishing re-sharing behaviors from re-creating behaviors in information diffusion,Yiran Xie; Hongzhi Yin; Bin Cui; Junjie Yao; Quanqing Xu,Abstract Social media plays a fundamental role in the diffusion of information. There are twodifferent ways of information diffusion in social media platforms such as Twitter and Weibo.Users can either re-share messages posted by their friends or re-create messages based onthe information acquired from other non-local information sources such as the mass media.By analyzing around 60 million messages from a large micro-blog site; we find that about69% of the diffusion volume can be attributed to users' re-sharing behaviors; and theremaining 31% are caused by user re-creating behaviors. The information diffusions causedby the two kinds of behaviors have different characteristics and variation trends; but mostexisting models of information diffusion do not distinguish them.

A gram-based string paradigm for efficient video subsequence search,Zi Huang; Jiajun Liu; Bin Cui; Xiaoyong Du,The unprecedented increase in the generation and dissemination of video data has createdan urgent demand for the large-scale video content management system to quickly retrievevideos of users' interests. Traditionally; video sequence data are managed by high-dimensional indexing structures; most of which suffer from the well-known “curse ofdimensionality” and lack of support of subsequence retrieval. Inspired by the high efficiencyof string indexing methods; in this paper; we present a string paradigm called VideoGram forlarge-scale video sequence indexing to achieve fast similarity search. In VideoGram; thefeature space is modeled as a set of visual words. Each database video sequence ismapped into a string. A gram-based indexing structure is then built to tackle the effect of the“curse of dimensionality” and support video subsequence matching. Given a high …,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,2013,1

Efficient approximation of the maximal preference scores by lightweight cubic views,Yueguo Chen; Bin Cui; Xiaoyong Du; Anthony KH Tung,Abstract Given a multi-features data set; a best preference query (BPQ) computes themaximal preference score (MPS) that the tuples in the data set can achieve with respect to apreference function. BPQs are very useful in applications where users want to efficientlycheck whether many individual data sets contain tuples that are of interest to them. Althougha BPQ can be naïvely answered by issuing a top-1 query and computing the score from thereturned tuple; doing so might require to load a larger number of tuples externally. In thispaper; we address the problem of efficient processing BPQs by using lightweight cubic (3-dimensional) views. With these in-memory views; the MPSs of BPQs can be efficientlyestimated with an error bound guaranteed; by paying only a small number of I/Os.

Linking identical neighborly partitions for efficient high-dimensional similarity search in unstructured peer-to-peer systems,Bin Cui; Linhao Xu; Jiakui Zhao,Abstract Peer-to-Peer (P2P) computing has recently attracted a great deal of researchattention. In a P2P system; a large number of nodes can potentially be pooled together toshare their resources; information; and services. However; existing unstructured P2Psystems lack support for content-based search over data objects which are generallyrepresented by high-dimensional feature vectors.

With the aid of LINP; each peercan not only process similarity query efficiently over its local data; but also can route thequery to the promising peers which may contain the desired data.

Then; based on the proposed model; we propose anovel index named the RNG (Road Network Grid) index for accelerating KNN queries andcontinuous KNN queries over road network constrained data points. In contrast toconventional methods; speed limitations and blocking information of roads are included intothe RNG index; which enables the index to support both distance-based and time-basedKNN queries and continuous KNN queries.

Evaluating MAX and MIN over sliding windows with various size using the exemplary sketch,Jiakui Zhao; Dongqing Yang; Bin Cui; Lijun Chen; Jun Gao,Abstract MAX and MIN are two important aggregates offered by the original SQLspecification. In the paper; we propose a novel mechanism; ie the exemplary sketch; toevaluate MAX and MIN over sliding windows with various size in the data streamenvironment. Performance analysis shows that evaluating MAX or MIN over w slidingwindows with various size using the exemplary sketch takes O (ln n) expected amortizedspace and O (w) expected amortized evaluation time; where n is the number of the tuples fallinto the maximal size sliding window. Moreover; the sliding-window semantics can also beintegrated into the exemplary sketch; which means that we no longer need to buffer all thetuples fall into current sliding windows separately for implementing the sliding-windowsemantics all alone.

An optimized process neural network model,Guojie Song; Dongqing Yang; Yunfeng Liu; Bin Cui; Ling Wu; Kunqing Xie,Abstract In this paper; we proposed an optimized process neural network based on fourierorthogonal base function; which can deal with both static value and time-varied continuousvalue simultaneously. To further improve its performance; we optimize the networktopological structure; which adopts fourier expansion based preprocessing. Experimentsbased on the real datasets show that our proposed churn prediction method has bettermaneuverability and performance. Most important of all; our method has been used in realapplications in China Mobile which is the major telecommunication company of the world.,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2007,*

Classifying e-mails via support vector machine,Lidan Shou; Bin Cui; Gang Chen; Jinxiang Dong,Abstract For addressing the growing problem of junk E-mail on the Internet; this paperproposes an effective E-mail classifying technique. Our work handles E-mail messages assemi-structured documents consisting of a set of fields with predefined semantics and anumber of variable length free-text contents. The main contributions of this paper include thefollowing: First; we present a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based model that incorporatesthe Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique to reduce the data in terms of size anddimensionality of the input feature space. As a result; the input data become classifiable withfewer features; and the training process has faster convergence speed. Second; we buildthe classification model using both the C-support vector machine and v-support vectormachine algorithms. Various control parameters for performance tuning are studied in an …,International Conference on Web-Age Information Management,2006,*
SSS: An Accurate and Fast Algorithm for Finding Top-k Hot Items in Data Streams,Junzhi Gong; Deyu Tian; Dongsheng Yang; Tong Yang; Tuo Dai; Bin Cui; Xiaoming Li,Abstract—Finding top-k hot items in a data stream is a critical problem in big datamanagement. It can benefit various kinds of applications; such as data mining; databases;network traffic measurement; security; etc. However; as the speed of data streams becomeincreasingly large; it becomes more and more challenging to design an accurate and fastalgorithm for this problem. There are several existing algorithms; including Space-Saving;Frequent; Lossy counting; with Space-Saving being the most widely used among them.Unfortunately; all these existing algorithms cannot achieve high memory efficiency and highaccuracy at the same time. In this paper; we propose an enhanced algorithm based onSpace-Saving; named Scoreboard Space-Saving (SSS); which not only achieves muchhigher accuracy; but also works at fast and constant speed. The key idea of SSS is to …,*,*,*
Single Hash: use one hash function to build faster hash based data structures,Xiangyang Gou; Chenxingyu Zhao; Tong Yang; Lei Zou; Yang Zhou; Yibo Yan; Xiaoming Li; Bin Cui,Abstract—With the scale of data to store or monitor in nowadays network constantlyincreasing; hash based data structures are more and more widely used because of theirhigh memory efficiency and high speed. Most of them; like Bloom filters; sketches and d-lefthash tables use more than one hash function. Furthermore; in order to achieve goodrandomicity; the hash functions used; like MD5 and SHA1; are very complicated andconsume a lot of CPU cycles to carry out. As a consequence; the implementation of thesehash functions will be time-consuming. In order to address this issue; we propose SingleHash technique in this paper. It is based on the observation that the hash functions we useproduce 32-bit or 64-bit values which have much bigger value ranges than that we need inpractice. We usually have to carry out modular operation to map the hash results into a …,*,*,*
Rectangular Hash Table: Bloom Filter and Bitmap Assisted Hash Table with High Speed,Tong Yang; Binchao Yin; Hang Li; Muhammad Shahzad; Steve Uhlig; Bin Cui; Xiaoming Li,Abstract—Hash table; a widely used data structure; can achieve an O (1) average lookupspeed at the cost of large memory usage. Unfortunately; hash tables suffer from collisionsand the rate of collisions is largely determined by the load factor. Broadly speaking; existingresearch has taken two approaches to improve the performance of hash tables. The firstapproach trades-off collision rate with memory usage; but only works well under low load.The second approach pursues high load and no hash collisions; but comes with updatefailures. The goal of this paper is to design a practical and efficient hash table that achieveshigh load factor; low hash collision rate; fast lookup speed; fast update speed; and zeroupdate failures. To achieve this goal; we take a three-step approach. First; we propose a setof hashing techniques that leverage Bloom filters to significantly reduce hash collision …,*,*,*
