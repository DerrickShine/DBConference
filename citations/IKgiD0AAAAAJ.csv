Transcriptionally active Stat1 is required for the antiproliferative effects of both interferon alpha and interferon gamma,Jacqueline F Bromberg; Curt M Horvath; Zilong Wen; Robert D Schreiber; James E Darnell,Abstract Type I (alpha; beta) and type II (gamma) interferons (IFNs) can restrict the growth ofmany cell types. INF-stimulated gene transcription; a key early event in IFN response; actsthrough the Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription pathway; inwhich both IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma activate the transcription factor Stat1. A cell linelacking Stat1 (U3A) was not growth-arrested by IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma; and experimentswere carried out with U3A cells permanently expressing normal or various mutant forms ofStat1 protein. Only cells in which complete Stat1 activity was available (Stat1alpha) weregrowth-inhibited by IFN-gamma. A mutant that supports 20-30% normal transcription did notcause growth restraint. In contrast; IFN-alpha growth restraint was imposed by cellsproducing Stat1beta; which lacks transcriptional activation potential.

(α; k)-anonymity: an enhanced k-anonymity model for privacy preserving data publishing,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Jiuyong Li; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang,Abstract Privacy preservation is an important issue in the release of data for miningpurposes. The k-anonymity model has been introduced for protecting individualidentification. Recent studies show that a more sophisticated model is necessary to protectthe association of individuals to sensitive information. In this paper; we propose an (α; k)-anonymity model to protect both identifications and relationships to sensitive information indata. We discuss the properties of (α; k)-anonymity model. We prove that the optimal (α; k)-anonymity problem is NP-hard. We first presentan optimal global-recoding method for the (α;k)-anonymity problem. Next we propose a local-recoding algorithm which is more scalableand result in less data distortion. The effectiveness and efficiency are shown by experiments.We also describe how the model can be extended to more general case.,Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,2006,354
Minimality attack in privacy preserving data publishing,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang; Jian Pei,Abstract Data publishing generates much concern over the protection of individual privacy.Recent studies consider cases where the adversary may possess different kinds ofknowledge about the data. In this paper; we show that knowledge of the mechanism oralgorithm of anonymization for data publication can also lead to extra information that assiststhe adversary and jeopardizes individual privacy. In particular; all known mechanisms try tominimize information loss and such an attempt provides a loophole for attacks. We call suchan attack a minimality attack. In this paper; we introduce a model called m-confidentialitywhich deals with minimality attacks; and propose a feasible solution. Our experiments showthat minimality attacks are practical concerns on real datasets and that our algorithm canprevent such attacks with very little overhead and information loss.,Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases,2007,279
Particle size analysis in pharmaceutics: principles; methods and applications,Boris Y Shekunov; Pratibhash Chattopadhyay; Henry HY Tong; Albert HL Chow,Abstract Abstract Physicochemical and biopharmaceutical properties of drug substancesand dosage forms can be highly affected by the particle size; a critical process parameter inpharmaceutical production. The fundamental issue with particle size analysis is the variety ofequivalent particle diameters generated by different methods; which is largely ascribable tothe particle shape and particle dispersion mechanism involved. Thus; to enable selection ofthe most appropriate or optimal sizing technique; cross-correlation between differenttechniques may be required. This review offers an in-depth discussion on particle sizeanalysis pertaining to specific pharmaceutical applications and regulatory aspects;fundamental principles and terminology; instrumentation types; data presentation andinterpretation; in-line and process analytical technology.

Scaling and time warping in time series querying,Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Eamonn Keogh; Leo Yung Lau; Chotirat Ann Ratanamahatana; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract The last few years have seen an increasing understanding that dynamic timewarping (DTW); a technique that allows local flexibility in aligning time series; is superior tothe ubiquitous Euclidean distance for time series classification; clustering; and indexing.More recently; it has been shown that for some problems; uniform scaling (US); a techniquethat allows global scaling of time series; may just be as important for some problems. In thiswork; we note that for many real world problems; it is necessary to combine both DTW andUS to achieve meaningful results. This is particularly true in domains where we mustaccount for the natural variability of human actions; including biometrics; query by humming;motion-capture/animation; and handwriting recognition. We introduce the first techniquewhich can handle both DTW and US simultaneously; our techniques involve search …,The VLDB Journal—The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases,2008,219
Semantics of ranking queries for probabilistic data and expected ranks,Graham Cormode; Feifei Li; Ke Yi,When dealing with massive quantities of data; top-k queries are a powerful technique forreturning only the k most relevant tuples for inspection; based on a scoring function. Theproblem of efficiently answering such ranking queries has been studied and analyzedextensively within traditional database settings. The importance of the top-k is perhaps evengreater in probabilistic databases; where a relation can encode exponentially many possibleworlds. There have been several recent attempts to propose definitions and algorithms forranking queries over probabilistic data. However; these all lack many of the intuitiveproperties of a top-k over deterministic data. Specifically; we define a number of fundamentalproperties; including exact-k; containment; unique-rank; value-invariance; and stability;which are all satisfied by ranking queries on certain data. We argue that all these …,Data Engineering; 2009. ICDE'09. IEEE 25th International Conference on,2009,212

Secretion of a bacterial cellulase by yeast,Nigel Skipper; Margaret Sutherland; R Wayne Davies; Douglas Kilburn; Robert C Miller; Anthony Warren; Raymond Wong,Gene fusions were constructed between a yeast expression plasmid and a Cellulomonasfimi DNA fragment encoding an endo-1; 4-β-D-glucanase or carboxymethylcellulase. Yeasttransformed with the recombinant plasmids secreted carboxymethylcellulase activity.Secretion of active enzyme was greatly increased when the leader of a secreted yeastprotein; the Kl toxin; was inserted immediately upstream of and in frame with the bacterialcellulase sequence. This is the first step in constructing a functional cellulase complex inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. It also provides an excellent system for the detailed examinationof the determinants of protein secretion because of the ease with which secreted cellulasecan be detected.,Science,1985,103
On the capacity of multi-channel wireless networks using directional antennas,H-N Dai; K-W Ng; R-W Wong; M-Y Wu,The capacity of wireless ad hoc networks is affected by two key factors: the interferenceamong concurrent transmissions and the number of simultaneous transmissions on a singleinterface. Recent studies found that using multiple channels can separate concurrenttransmissions and greatly improve network throughput. However; those studies onlyconsider that wireless nodes are equipped with only omnidirectional antennas; which causehigh collisions. On the other hand; some researchers found that directional antennas bringmore benefits such as reduced interference and increased spatial reuse compared withomnidirectional antennas. But; they only focused on a single-channel network which onlyallows finite concurrent transmissions. Thus; combining the two technologies of multiplechannels and directional antennas together potentially brings more benefits. In this paper …,INFOCOM 2008.

Achieving k-anonymity by clustering in attribute hierarchical structures,Jiuyong Li; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jian Pei,Abstract Individual privacy will be at risk if a published data set is not properly de-identified. k-anonymity is a major technique to de-identify a data set. A more general view of k-anonymityis clustering with a constraint of the minimum number of objects in every cluster. Mostexisting approaches to achieving k-anonymity by clustering are for numerical (or ordinal)attributes. In this paper; we study achieving k-anonymity by clustering in attributehierarchical structures. We define generalisation distances between tuples to characterisedistortions by generalisations and discuss the properties of the distances. We conclude thatthe generalisation distance is a metric distance. We propose an efficient clustering-basedalgorithm for k-anonymisation. We experimentally show that the proposed method is morescalable and causes significantly less distortions than an optimal global recoding k …,International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery,2006,99
Efficient method for maximizing bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; M Tamer Özsu; Philip S Yu; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Lian Liu,Abstract Bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor (BRNN) has been extensively studied inspatial database literature. In this paper; we study a related problem called MaxBRNN: findan optimal region that maximizes the size of BRNNs. Such a problem has many real lifeapplications; including the problem of finding a new server point that attracts as manycustomers as possible by proximity. A straightforward approach is to determine the BRNNsfor all possible points that are not feasible since there are a large (or infinite) number ofpossible points. To the best of our knowledge; the fastest known method has exponentialtime complexity on the data size. Based on some interesting properties of the problem; wecome up with an efficient algorithm called MaxOverlap. Extensive experiments areconducted to show that our algorithm is many times faster than the best-known technique.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,90

Methods: In this 3-year prospective clinicaltrial; 161 subjects were enrolled and 154 commenced extended wear. Clinical performancewas assessed by comparing discontinuations and lens surface characteristics (front surfacedeposits; lens wettability; number of mucin balls); lens fitting performance (primary gazemovement; lens tightness); and physiologic parameters (limbal and bulbar redness; cornealand conjunctival staining; microcysts) and subjective parameters (ratings of comfort andvision) between groups. Results: Eighty-eight subjects remained in the study after 36months. There were no differences in the probability of subjects surviving in either group;and the major cause of lens-related discontinuation in both groups was contact lens …,Optometry and vision science,2004,83
Privacy preserving serial data publishing by role composition,Yingyi Bu; Ada Wai Chee Fu; Raymond Chi Wing Wong; Lei Chen; Jiuyong Li,Abstract Previous works about privacy preserving serial data publishing on dynamicdatabases have relied on unrealistic assumptions of the nature of dynamic databases. Inmany applications; some sensitive values changes freely while others never change. Forexample; in medical applications; the disease attribute changes with time when patientsrecover from one disease and develop another disease. However; patients do not recoverfrom some diseases such as HIV. We call such diseases permanent sensitive values. To thebest of our knowledge; none of the existing solutions handle these realistic issues. Wepropose a novel anonymization approach called HD-composition to solve the aboveproblems. Extensive experiments with real data confirm our theoretical results.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,81

Mining top-K frequent itemsets from data streams,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Abstract Frequent pattern mining on data streams is of interest recently. However; it is noteasy for users to determine a proper frequency threshold. It is more reasonable to ask usersto set a bound on the result size. We study the problem of mining top K frequent itemsets indata streams. We introduce a method based on the Chernoff bound with a guarantee of theoutput quality and also a bound on the memory usage. We also propose an algorithm basedon the Lossy Counting Algorithm. In most of the experiments of the two proposed algorithms;we obtain perfect solutions and the memory space occupied by our algorithms is very small.Besides; we also propose the adapted approach of these two algorithms in order to handlethe case when we are interested in mining the data in a sliding window. The experimentsshow that the results are accurate.,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2006,73
Efficient skyline querying with variable user preferences on nominal attributes,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jian Pei; Yip Sing Ho; Tai Wong; Yubao Liu,Abstract Current skyline evaluation techniques assume a fixed ordering on the attributes.However; dynamic preferences on nominal attributes are more realistic in knownapplications. In order to generate online response for any such preference issued by a user;one obvious solution is to enumerate all possible preferences and materialize all results ofthese preferences. However; the pre-processing and storage requirements of a fullmaterialization are typically prohibitive. Instead; we propose a semi-materialization methodcalled the IPO-tree Search which stores partial useful results only. With these partial results;the result of each possible preference can be returned efficiently. We have also conductedexperiments to show the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2008,70

Data mining for inventory item selection with cross-selling considerations,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang,Abstract Association rule mining; studied for over ten years in the literature of data mining;aims to help enterprises with sophisticated decision making; but the resulting rules typicallycannot be directly applied and require further processing. In this paper; we propose amethod for actionable recommendations from itemset analysis and investigate anapplication of the concepts of association rules—maximal-profit item selection with cross-selling effect (MPIS). This problem is about choosing a subset of items which can give themaximal profit with the consideration of cross-selling effect. A simple approach to thisproblem is shown to be NP-hard. A new approach is proposed with consideration of the lossrule—a rule similar to the association rule—to model the cross-selling effect. We show thatMPIS can be approximated by a quadratic programming problem. We also propose a …,Data mining and knowledge discovery,2005,68
Collective spatial keyword queries: a distance owner-driven approach,Cheng Long; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ke Wang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Abstract Recently; spatial keyword queries become a hot topic in the literature. One exampleof these queries is the collective spatial keyword query (CoSKQ) which is to find a set ofobjects in the database such that it covers a set of given keywords collectively and has thesmallest cost. Unfortunately; existing exact algorithms have severe scalability problems andexisting approximate algorithms; though scalable; cannot guarantee near-to-optimalsolutions. In this paper; we study the CoSKQ problem and address the above issues. Firstly;we consider the CoSKQ problem using an existing cost measurement called the maximumsum cost. This problem is called MaxSum-CoSKQ and is known to be NP-hard. We observethat the maximum sum cost of a set of objects is dominated by at most three objects whichwe call the distance owners of the set. Motivated by this; we propose a distance owner …,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2013,67
Projective clustering by histograms,Eric Ka Ka Ng; AW-C Fu; RC-W Wong,Recent research suggests that clustering for high-dimensional data should involvesearching for" hidden" subspaces with lower dimensionalities; in which patterns can beobserved when data objects are projected onto the subspaces. Discovering suchinterattribute correlations and location of the corresponding clusters is known as theprojective clustering problem. We propose an efficient projective clustering technique byhistogram construction (EPCH). The histograms help to generate" signatures"; where asignature corresponds to some region in some subspace; and signatures with a largenumber of data objects are identified as the regions for subspace clusters. Hence; projectedclusters and their corresponding subspaces can be uncovered. Compared to the bestprevious methods to our knowledge; this approach is more flexible in that less prior …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2005,65
Active spectral clustering,Xiang Wang; Ian Davidson,The technique of spectral clustering is widely used to segment a range of data from graphsto images. Our work marks a natural progression of spectral clustering from the originalpassive unsupervised formulation to our active semi-supervised formulation. We follow thewidely used area of constrained clustering and allow supervision in the form of pair wiserelations between two nodes: Must-Link and Cannot-Link. Unlike most previous constrainedclustering work; our constraints are specified incrementally by querying an oracle (domainexpert). Since in practice; each query comes with a cost; our goal is to maximally improvethe result with as few queries as possible. The advantages of our approach include: 1) it isprincipled by querying the constraints which maximally reduce the expected error; 2) it canincorporate both hard and soft constraints which are prevalent in practice. We empirically …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2010 IEEE 10th International Conference on,2010,63
On efficient spatial matching,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Yufei Tao; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Xiaokui Xiao,Abstract This paper proposes and solves a new problem called spatial matching (SPM). LetP and O be two sets of objects in an arbitrary metric space; where object distances aredefined according to a norm satisfying the triangle inequality. Each object in O represents acustomer; and each object in P indicates a service provider; which has a capacitycorresponding to the maximum number of customers that can be supported by the provider.SPM assigns each customer to her/his nearest provider; among all the providers whosecapacities have not been exhausted in serving other closer customers. We elaborate theapplications where SPM is useful; and develop algorithms that settle this problem with alinear number O (| P|+| O|) of nearest neighbor queries.

Results: VarianceComponent models showed that site-level variations contributed about 70–90% of the totalvariance. About a 10% reduction of the total variations of PPD reduction in initially diseasedsites was achieved with the inclusion of the 10 predictors in the multilevel multipleregression.

Creating competitive products,Qian Wan; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ihab F Ilyas; M Tamer Özsu; Yu Peng,Abstract The importance of dominance and skyline analysis has been well recognized inmulti-criteria decision making applications. Most previous works study how to helpcustomers find a set of" best" possible products from a pool of given products. In this paper;we identify an interesting problem; creating competitive products; which has not beenstudied before. Given a set of products in the existing market; we want to study how to createa set of" best" possible products such that the newly created products are not dominated bythe products in the existing market. We refer such products as competitive products. Astraightforward solution is to generate a set of all possible products and check fordominance relationships. However; the whole set is quite large. In this paper; we propose asolution to generate a subset of this set effectively. An extensive performance study using …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2009,58

Can the utility of anonymized data be used for privacy breaches?,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang; Philip S Yu; Jian Pei,Abstract Group based anonymization is the most widely studied approach for privacy-preserving data publishing.

The goal of this article is toraise a fundamental issue regarding the privacy exposure of the approaches using groupbased anonymization. This has been overlooked in the past. The group basedanonymization approach by bucketization basically hides each individual record behind agroup to preserve data privacy.

The potential of theperiosteum regarding the growth modulation of bone has been verified in vitro and in vivo.The failure of the periosteum in patients who suffer bone defects induced by tumor or traumaposes a considerable challenge.[4] Creating an artificial scaffold that presents the conditionsand morphology necessary to simulate the native periosteum may be an ideal approach forthese cases. Due to the increasing awareness of the periosteum's importance; numerousrecent studies have constructed tissue engineered periosteum using collagen andhydrogels.[5] However; most of these studies have neglected the hierarchical topographicsurface of the periosteum; which is important for bone elongation.

A highly optimized algorithm for continuous intersection join queries over moving objects,Rui Zhang; Jianzhong Qi; Dan Lin; Wei Wang; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract Given two sets of moving objects with nonzero extents; the continuous intersectionjoin query reports every pair of intersecting objects; one from each of the two moving objectsets; for every timestamp. This type of queries is important for a number of applications; eg;in the multi-billion dollar computer game industry; massively multiplayer online games likeWorld of Warcraft need to monitor the intersection among players' attack ranges and renderplayers' interaction in real time. The computational cost of a straightforward algorithm or analgorithm adapted from another query type is prohibitive; and answering the query in realtime poses a great challenge. Those algorithms compute the query answer for either toolong or too short a time interval; which results in either a very large computation cost peranswer update or too frequent answer updates; respectively.

Stock market bubbles and unemployment,Jianjun Miao; Pengfei Wang; Lifang Xu,Abstract This paper incorporates endogenous credit constraints in a search model ofunemployment. These constraints generate multiple equilibria supported by self-fulfillingbeliefs. A stock market bubble emerges through a positive feedback loop mechanism. Thecollapse of the bubble tightens the credit constraints; causing firms to reduce investment andhirings. Unemployed workers are hard to find jobs generating high and persistentunemployment. A recession is caused by shifts in beliefs; even though there is noexogenous shock to the fundamentals.,Economic Theory,2016,43

Quite a number of indexeshave been proposed to answer such distance queries. However; all of these indexes canonly process graphs of size barely up to 1 million vertices; which is rather small in view ofmany of the fast-growing real-world graphs today such as social networks and Web graphs.We propose an efficient index; which is a novel labeling scheme based on the independentset of a graph. We show that our method can handle graphs of size orders of magnitudelarger than existing indexes.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,41

MPIS: Maximal-profit item selection with cross-selling considerations,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang,In the literature of data mining; many different algorithms for association rule mining havebeen proposed. However; there is relatively little study on how association rules can aid inmore specific targets. One of the applications for association rules-maximal-profit itemselection with cross-selling effect (MPIS) problem-is investigated. The problem is aboutselecting a subset of items; which can give the maximal profit with the consideration of cross-selling. We prove that a simple version of this problem is NP-hard. We propose a newapproach to the problem with the consideration of the loss rule-a kind of association rule tomodel the cross-selling effect. We show that the problem can be transformed to a quadraticprogramming problem. In case quadratic programming is not applicable; we also propose aheuristic approach. Experiments are conducted to show that both of the proposed …,Data Mining; 2003. ICDM 2003. Third IEEE International Conference on,2003,40
Finding top-k profitable products,Qian Wan; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Yu Peng,The importance of dominance and skyline analysis has been well recognized in multi-criteria decision making applications. Most previous studies focus on how to help customersfind a set of “best” possible products from a pool of given products. In this paper; we identifyan interesting problem; finding top-k profitable products; which has not been studied before.Given a set of products in the existing market; we want to find a set of k “best” possibleproducts such that these new products are not dominated by the products in the existingmarket. In this problem; we need to set the prices of these products such that the total profit ismaximized. We refer such products as top-k profitable products. A straightforward solution isto enumerate all possible subsets of size k and find the subset which gives the greatestprofit. However; there are an exponential number of possible subsets.

Mining N-most interesting itemsets without support threshold by the COFI-tree,Sze-Chung Ngan; Tsang Lam; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Data mining is the discovery of interesting and hidden patterns from a large amount ofcollected data. Applications can be found in many organisations with large databases; formany different purposes such as customer relationships; marketing; planning; scientificdiscovery; and other data analysis. In this paper; the problem of mining N-most interestingitemsets is addressed. We make use of the techniques of COFI-tree in order to tackle theproblem. In our experiments; we find that our proposed algorithm based on COFI-treeperforms faster than the previous approach BOMO based on the FP-tree.,International Journal of Business Intelligence and Data Mining,2005,38
Development of ruthenium (II) complexes as topical antibiotics against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,P-L Lam; G-L Lu; K-M Hon; K-W Lee; C-L Ho; X Wang; JC-O Tang; K-H Lam; RS-M Wong; SH-L Kok; Z-X Bian; H Li; KK-H Lee; R Gambari; C-H Chui; W-Y Wong,A series of ruthenium (II) bis (2; 2′-bipyridyl) complexes containing N-phenyl-substituteddiazafluorenes (Ru-C1; Ru-C6; Ru-C7 and Ru-F) was synthesized and their potentialantibacterial activity against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) wasinvestigated. The Ru-C7 complex showed significant improvement in both minimuminhibitory concentration (MIC; 6.25 μg mL− 1) and minimum bactericidal concentration(MBC; 25 μg mL− 1) towards MRSA when compared with those of methicillin (positivecontrol)(MIC= 25 μg mL− 1 and MBC= 100 μg mL− 1). The Ru-C7 complex possessed muchstronger antibacterial effects than the Ru-C6 complex (MIC; 25 μg mL− 1; MBC;> 100 μgmL− 1). Both Ru-C6 and Ru-C7 complexes were also demonstrated to be biologically safewhen tested on normal human skin keratinocytes.,Dalton Transactions,2014,35
A survey of transfer and multitask learning in bioinformatics,Qian Xu; Qiang Yang,Abstract Machine learning and data mining have found many applications in biologicaldomains; where we look to build predictive models based on labeled training data.However; in practice; high quality labeled data is scarce; and to label new data incurs highcosts. Transfer and multitask learning offer an attractive alternative; by allowing usefulknowledge to be extracted and transferred from data in auxiliary domains helps counter thelack of data problem in the target domain. In this article; we survey recent advances intransfer and multitask learning for bioinformatics applications. In particular; we surveyseveral key bioinformatics application areas; including sequence classification; geneexpression data analysis; biological network reconstruction and biomedical applications.,Journal of Computing Science and Engineering,2011,35
Evaluating the responsiveness of the ICOAP following hip or knee replacement,AM Davis; LS Lohmander; R Wong; V Venkataramanan; GA Hawker,summary Objective The Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis (OA) Pain (ICOAP)questionnaire evaluates the constructs of 'intermittent'(tm) and 'constant'(tm) pain. Thesesare conceptually different from 'pain on activity'(tm) and pain 'intensity'(tm) as measured bythe WOMAC and Chronic Pain Grade (CPG); measures commonly used in OA. The purposeof this study was to evaluate the responsiveness of the ICOAP; and different pain constructsin primary total hip (THR) and total knee (TKR) replacement. Methods Patients completedthe ICOAP; WOMAC and HOOS/KOOS pain and the CPG pre-and 6 months post surgery.Scores were standardized to 0 to 100; where higher scores indicate worse pain. Descriptivestatistics were calculated for all data. The standardized response mean (SRM) wascalculated for each measure as were correlations of change scores.

Clinical experience in managing pediatric patients with ultra-short bowel syndrome using omega-3 fatty acid,PHY Chung; KKY Wong; RMS Wong; NS Tsoi; KL Chan; PKH Tam,Abstract Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) remains an important component of themanagement of short bowl syndrome in pediatric patients. However; prolonged TPN isknown to be associated with cholestasis. Recently; the use of omega-3-fatty acid(Omegaven) has been proposed to improve TPN cholestasis. We present the early outcomeafter administration of Omegaven in four patients with ultra-short bowel syndrome. Based onour experience; it appears that omega-3 fatty acid can reverse and prevent the advent ofTPN-related cholestasis; thereby significantly improving the process of intestinal adaptation.We suggest that clinicians consider this treatment option before proceeding to invasivesurgery to reverse cholestasis. Prospective randomized trials are necessary to define astandard protocol and elucidate other potential benefits of this novel agent.,European journal of pediatric surgery,2010,35
Direction-preserving trajectory simplification,Cheng Long; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; HV Jagadish,Abstract Trajectories of moving objects are collected in many applications. Raw trajectorydata is typically very large; and has to be simplified before use. In this paper; we introducethe notion of direction-preserving trajectory simplification; and show both analytically andempirically that it can support a broader range of applications than traditional position-preserving trajectory simplification. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for optimaldirection-preserving simplification; and another approximate algorithm with a qualityguarantee. Extensive experimental evaluation with real trajectory data shows the benefit ofthe new techniques.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,34
Minimizing seed set for viral marketing,Cheng Long; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Viral marketing has attracted considerable concerns in recent years due to its novel idea ofleveraging the social network to propagate the awareness of products. Specifically; viralmarketing is to first target a limited number of users (seeds) in the social network byproviding incentives; and these targeted users would then initiate the process of awarenessspread by propagating the information to their friends via their social relationships. Extensivestudies have been conducted for maximizing the awareness spread given the number ofseeds. However; all of them fail to consider the common scenario of viral marketing wherecompanies hope to use as few seeds as possible yet influencing at least a certain number ofusers. In this paper; we propose a new problem; called J-MIN-Seed; whose objective is tominimize the number of seeds while at least J users are influenced.

Privacy-preserving frequent pattern mining across private databases,AW-C Fu; RC-W Wong; Ke Wang,Privacy consideration has much significance in the application of data mining. It is veryimportant that the privacy of individual parties is not exposed when data mining techniquesare applied to a large collection of data about the parties. In many scenarios such as datawarehousing or data integration; data from the different parties form a many-to-manyschema. This paper addresses the problem of privacy-preserving frequent pattern mining insuch a schema across two dimension sites. We assume that sites are not trusted and theyare semi-honest. Our method is based on the concept of semi-join and does not involve dataencryption which is used in most previous work. Experiments are conducted to study theefficiency of the proposed models.,Data Mining; Fifth IEEE International Conference on,2005,34

Improvement of adhesive bonding in aluminium alloys using a laser surface texturing process,RCP Wong; AP Hoult; Jang Kyo Kim; TX Yu,Abstract A study has been made of the surface modification of aluminium alloys using the Nd-YAG pulsed solid-state laser technique. The melt cavities on an aluminium alloy surfaceproduced by the laser have two main features; namely non-periodic concentric rings andmicrocracks. The concentric ring structures effectively increase the surface area; enhancingthe adhesive bond quality; whilst the laser pulse shaping technique was introduced tocontrol the appearance of these features; whereby the original rectangular laser pulseshape could be altered; so that a different laser intensity and cooling rate could be used. Thelaser intensity is found to be a predominant factor for the formation of the concentric ringstructures. In the high intensity range the laser beam excited oscillations; generating circularwaves which are reflected by the frozen melt pools.

On eavesdropping attacks in wireless sensor networks with directional antennas,Hong-Ning Dai; Qiu Wang; Dong Li; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,The eavesdropping attack is a serious security threat to a wireless sensor network (WSN)since the eavesdropping attack is a prerequisite for other attacks. Conventional WSNsconsist of wireless nodes equipped with omnidirectional antennas; which broadcast radiosignals in all directions and are consequently prone to the eavesdropping attacks. Differentfrom omnidirectional antennas; directional antennas radiate radio signals on desireddirections and potentially reduce the possibility of the eavesdropping attacks. In this paper;we propose a model to analyze the eavesdropping probability in both single-hop WSNs andmultihop WSNs with omnidirectional antennas and directional antennas. We verify thecorrectness of our analytical model by conducting extensive simulations. We have found thatusing directional antennas in either single-hop WSNs or multihop WSNs can significantly …,International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks,2013,31
Finding the influence set through skylines,Xiaobing Wu; Yufei Tao; Raymong Chi-Wing Wong; Ling Ding; Jeffrey Xu Yu,Abstract Given a set P of products; a set O of customers; and a product p ε P; a bichromaticreverse skyline query retrieves all the customers in O that do not find any other product in Pto be absolutely better than p. More specifically; a customer o ε O is in the reverse skyline ofp ε P if and only no other product in P better matches the preference of o on all dimensions.The only existing bichromatic reverse skyline algorithm; which we refer to as basic; isdesigned for uncertain data. This paper focuses on traditional datasets; where each object isa precise point. Since a precise point can be regarded as a special uncertain object; basiccan still be applied. However; as precise data are inherently easier to handle than uncertaindata; one should expect that basic can be further improved by taking advantage of thereduced problem complexity. Indeed; we observe several non-trivial heuristics that can …,Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology,2009,31
Efficient algorithms for optimal location queries in road networks,Zitong Chen; Yubao Liu; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Jiamin Xiong; Ganglin Mai; Cheng Long,Abstract In this paper; we study the optimal location query problem based on road networks.Specifically; we have a road network on which some clients and servers are located. Eachclient finds the server that is closest to her for service and her cost of getting served is equalto the (network) distance between the client and the server serving her multiplied by herweight or importance. The optimal location query problem is to find a location for setting up anew server such that the maximum cost of clients being served by the servers (including thenew server) is minimized. This problem has been studied before; but the state-of-the-art isstill not efficient enough. In this paper; we propose an efficient algorithm for the optimallocation query problem; which is based on a novel idea of\emph {nearest locationcomponent}. We also discuss three extensions of the optimal location query problem …,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,29
Online skyline analysis with dynamic preferences on nominal attributes,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Jian Pei; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang,The importance of skyline analysis has been well recognized in multi-criteria decisionmaking applications. All of the previous studies assume a fixed order on the attributes inquestion. However; in some applications; users may be interested in skylines with respect tovarious total or partial orders on nominal attributes. In this paper; we identify and tackle theproblem of online skyline analysis with dynamic preferences on nominal attributes. Weinvestigate how changes of orders in attributes lead to changes of skylines. We address twonovel types of interesting queries: a viewpoint query returns with respect to which orders apoint is (or is not) in the skylines and an order-based skyline query retrieves the skyline withrespect to a specific order. We develop two methods systematically and report an extensiveperformance study using both synthetic and real data sets to verify their effectiveness and …,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2009,29
Mining favorable facets,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Jian Pei; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang,Abstract The importance of dominance and skyline analysis has been well recognized inmulti-criteria decision making applications. Most previous studies assume a fixed order onthe attributes. In practice; different customers may have different preferences on nominalattributes. In this paper; we identify an interesting data mining problem; finding favorablefacets; which has not been studied before. Given a set of points in a multidimensional space;for a specific target point p we want to discover with respect to which combinations of orders(eg; customer preferences) on the nominal attributes p is not dominated by any other points.Such combinations are called the favorable facets of p. We consider both the effectivenessand the efficiency of the mining. A given point may have many favorable facets.

Efficient selection of process mining algorithms,Jianmin Wang; Raymond K Wong; Jianwei Ding; Qinlong Guo; Lijie Wen,While many process mining algorithms have been proposed recently; there does not exist awidely accepted benchmark to evaluate and compare these process mining algorithms. As aresult; it can be difficult to choose a suitable process mining algorithm for a given enterpriseor application domain. Some recent benchmark systems have been developed andproposed to address this issue. However; evaluating available process mining algorithmsagainst a large set of business models (eg; in a large enterprise) can be computationallyexpensive; tedious; and time-consuming. This paper investigates a scalable solution thatcan evaluate; compare; and rank these process mining algorithms efficiently; and henceproposes a novel framework that can efficiently select the process mining algorithms that aremost suitable for a given model set. In particular; using our framework; only a portion of …,IEEE Transactions on Services Computing,2013,28
Global privacy guarantee in serial data publishing,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jia Liu; Ke Wang; Yabo Xu,While previous works on privacy-preserving serial data publishing consider the scenariowhere sensitive values may persist over multiple data releases; we find that no previouswork has sufficient protection provided for sensitive values that can change over time; whichshould be the more common case. In this work; we propose to study the privacy guaranteefor such transient sensitive values; which we call the global guarantee. We formally definethe problem for achieving this guarantee. We show that the data satisfying the globalguarantee also satisfies a privacy guarantee commonly adopted in the privacy literaturecalled the local guarantee.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on,2010,28
Exploiting hidden convexity for flexible and robust resource allocation in cellular networks,Chee-Wei Tan; Daniel Pérez Palomar; Mung Chiang,A systematic approach to solve seemingly nonconvex resource allocation problems inwireless cellular networks is studied in this paper. By revealing and exploiting the hiddenconvexity in the problem formulations; we obtain solutions that can tackle a variety ofobjective functions; provide robustness to resource allocations such as power; and beobtained often through distributed algorithms. The advantages of such flexibility androbustness are demonstrated through comparisons with the state-of-the-art in recentresearch literature. First we show how to distributively solve a variety of resource allocationproblems in CDMA and interference limited CDMA channels with quality of serviceconstraints; such as meeting minimum queueing delay or energy per bit requirement. Then;for uplink transmission in a CDMA cellular network; we propose an optimal power control …,INFOCOM 2007. 26th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE,2007,28

Efficient methods for finding influential locations with adaptive grids,Da Yan; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Wilfred Ng,Abstract Given a set S of servers and a set C of clients; an optimal-location query returns alocation where a new server can attract the greatest number of clients. Optimal-locationqueries are important in a lot of real-life applications; such as mobile service planning orresource distribution in an area. Previous studies assume that a client always visits itsnearest server; which is too strict to be true in reality. In this paper; we relax this assumptionand propose a new model to tackle this problem. We further generalize the problem tofinding top-k optimal locations. The main challenge is that; even the fastest approach inexisting studies needs to take hours to answer an optimal-location query on a typical realworld dataset; which significantly limits the applications of the query. Using our relaxedmodel; we design an efficient grid-based approximation algorithm called FILM (Fast …,Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management,2011,24
Anonymization-based attacks in privacy-preserving data publishing,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang; Jian Pei,Abstract Data publishing generates much concern over the protection of individual privacy.Recent studies consider cases where the adversary may possess different kinds ofknowledge about the data. In this article; we show that knowledge of the mechanism oralgorithm of anonymization for data publication can also lead to extra information that assiststhe adversary and jeopardizes individual privacy. In particular; all known mechanisms try tominimize information loss and such an attempt provides a loophole for attacks. We call suchan attack a minimality attack. In this article; we introduce a model called m-confidentialitywhich deals with minimality attacks; and propose a feasible solution. Our experiments showthat minimality attacks are practical concerns on real datasets and that our algorithm canprevent such attacks with very little overhead and information loss.,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),2009,24
Mining top-k itemsets over a sliding window based on zipfian distribution,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Abstract Frequent pattern discovery in data streams can be very useful in differentapplications. In time critical applications; a sliding window model is needed to discount staledata. In this paper; we adopt this model to mine the K most interesting itemsets; or toestimate the K most frequent itemsets of different sizes in a data stream. In our method; thesliding window is partitioned into buckets. We maintain the statistics of the frequency countsof the itemsets for the transactions in each bucket. We prove that our algorithm guaranteesno false negatives for any data distributions. We also show that the number of false positivesreturned is typically small according to Zipfian Distribution. Our experiments on syntheticdata show that the memory used by our method is tens of times smaller than that of a naiveapproach; and the false positives are negligible.,*,2005,24
A new approach for maximizing bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor search,Yubao Liu; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ke Wang; Zhijie Li; Cheng Chen; Zhitong Chen,Abstract Maximizing bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor (MaxBRNN) is a variant ofbichromatic reverse nearest neighbor (BRNN). The purpose of the MaxBRNN problem is tofind an optimal region that maximizes the size of BRNNs. This problem has lots of realapplications such as location planning and profile-based marketing. The best-knownalgorithm for the MaxBRNN problem is called MaxOverlap. In this paper; we study theMaxBRNN problem and propose a new approach called MaxSegment for a two-dimensionalspace when the L_2-norm is used. Then; we extend our algorithm to other variations of theMaxBRNN problem such as the MaxBRNN problem with other metric spaces; and a three-dimensional space. Finally; we conducted experiments on real and synthetic datasets tocompare our proposed algorithm with existing algorithms. The experimental results verify …,Knowledge and information systems,2013,23

Non-uniform strain distribution due to the stress concentration at the delamination tip wasexamined by the way of observing the reflection spectrum from the FBG sensor. The stressconcentration in ENF specimens; which are subjected to various applied loads; wasanalyzed in terms of the shift; shape; bandwidth and intensity of the reflection spectrum.Relationships between the load–displacement graphs and the corresponding reflectionspectra under ENF tests were established.

Maximizing bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor for lp-norm in two-and three-dimensional spaces,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; M Tamer Özsu; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Philip S Yu; Lian Liu; Yubao Liu,Abstract Bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor (BRNN) has been extensively studied inspatial database literature. In this paper; we study a related problem called MaxBRNN: findan optimal region that maximizes the size of BRNNs for L p-norm in two-and three-dimensional spaces. Such a problem has many real-life applications; including the problemof finding a new server point that attracts as many customers as possible by proximity. Astraightforward approach is to determine the BRNNs for all possible points that are notfeasible since there are a large (or infinite) number of possible points. To the best of ourknowledge; there are no existing algorithms which solve MaxBRNN for any L p-norm spaceof two-and three-dimensionality.

Finding shortest path on land surface,Lian Liu; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract Finding shortest paths is a fundamental operator in spatial databases. Recently;terrain datasets have attracted a lot of attention from both industry and academia. There aresome interesting issues to be studied in terrain datasets which cannot be found in atraditional two-dimensional space. In this paper; we study one of the issues called a slopeconstraint which exists in terrain datasets. In this paper; we propose a problem of findingshortest paths with the slope constraint. Then; we show that this new problem is moregeneral than the traditional problem of finding shortest paths without considering the slopeconstraint. Since finding shortest paths with the slope constraint is costly; we propose a newframework called surface simplification so that we can compute shortest paths with the slopeconstraint efficiently. Under this framework; the surface is" simplified" such that the …,Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data,2011,22
Traffic rationing and short-term and long-term equilibrium,Xiaolei Wang; Hai Yang; Deren Han,Road rationing as a possible alternative or supplement to road pricing has beenimplemented in several large cities but has received limited attention in the theoreticaltransportation research community. This paper analyzes the effects of road rationing undershort-term and long-term traffic equilibrium. Short-term equilibrium describes the situationunder which no one changes car ownership but simply obeys the rationing rules. In contrast;long-term equilibrium under road rationing takes into account the public's self-adjustmentactivities such as car consumption and car disposal and characterizes the equilibriumsituation in which no incentive exists to change car ownership. For short-and long-termrationing; equilibrium patterns are determined; and the average daily trip travel time with onecar is found to be the essential factor in determining the attainability of Pareto …,Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board,2010,22

Given a directed or undirected graph;we propose to build an index for answering such queries based on a novel hop-doublinglabeling technique. We derive bounds on the index size; the computation costs and I/O costsbased on the properties of unweighted scale-free graphs. We show that our method is muchmore efficient and effective compared to the state-of-the-art techniques; in terms of bothquerying time and indexing costs. Our empirical study shows that our method can handlegraphs that are orders of magnitude larger than existing methods.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,20
Heterogeneous configuration memory scrubbing for soft error mitigation in FPGAs,Ju-Yueh Lee; Cheng-Ru Chang; Naifeng Jing; Juexiao Su; Shijie Wen; Rick Wong; Lei He,In this paper; we present HCS-Heterogeneous CRAM Scrubbing-for FPGAs. By utilizingstochastic fault modeling for SEUs in CRAM; we present a quantitative estimate of systemMTTF improvement through CRAM scrubbing. HCS then leverages the fact that differentSEUs have unequal effects on the circuit system operation; and thus the CRAM bits can bescrubbed at different rates based on the sensitivity of the bits to the circuit system failures. Tomaximize the improvement on system MTTF for a given circuit system; we present a dynamicprogramming algorithm which solves the problem efficiently and effectively.

Damping-ratio measurements by the spectral-ratio method,Yu-Hsing Wang; Wai Man Yan; Kai Fung Lo,In this paper; bender elements are used as sensors to measure the damping ratio of soil bythe spectral-ratio method. The results of numerical and physical experiments suggest thatadequate measurement precision can be achieved by reducing the two types of inherentbiases arising from (i) the near-field effect and (ii) the different transfer functions of the tworeceiver bender elements. The first bias can be avoided by setting sensors to r 1/λ≥ 2.0 andr 1/r 2≥ 2.0; where r 1 and r 2 are the distances between the source and the first and secondreceivers; respectively; and λ is the wavelength. The second bias can be minimized bymodifying the original spectral-ratio method to accommodate the self-healing technique.

ff-anonymity: When quasi-identifiers are missing,Ke Wang; Yabo Xu; Ada WC Fu; Raymond CW Wong,Existing approaches on privacy-preserving data publishing rely on the assumption that datacan be divided into quasi-identifier attributes (QI) and sensitive attribute (SA). Thisassumption does not hold when an attribute has both sensitive values and identifyingvalues; which is typically the case. In this paper; we study how such attributes would impactthe privacy model and data anonymization. We identify a new form of attacks; called"freeform attacks"; that occur on such data without explicit QI attributes and SA attributes. Wepresent a framework for modeling identifying/sensitive information at the value level; definea problem to eliminate freeform attacks; and outline an efficient solution.,Data Engineering; 2009.

Viral marketing for dedicated customers,Cheng Long; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract Viral marketing has attracted considerable concerns in recent years due to its novelidea of leveraging the social network to propagate the awareness of products. Specifically;viral marketing first targets a limited number of users (seeds) in the social network byproviding incentives; and these targeted users would then initiate the process of awarenessspread by propagating the information to their friends via their social relationships. Extensivestudies have been conducted for maximizing the awareness spread given the number ofseeds (the Influence Maximization problem). However; all of them fail to consider thecommon scenario of viral marketing where companies hope to use as few seeds as possibleyet influencing at least a certain number of users. In this paper; we propose a new problem;called J-MIN-Seed; whose objective is to minimize the number of seeds while at least J …,Information Systems,2014,16
On good and fair paper-reviewer assignment,Cheng Long; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Yu Peng; Liangliang Ye,Peer review has become the most common practice for judging papers submitted to aconference for decades. An extremely important task involved in peer review is to assignsubmitted papers to reviewers with appropriate expertise which is referred to as paper-reviewer assignment. In this paper; we study the paper-reviewer assignment problem fromboth the goodness aspect and the fairness aspect. For the goodness aspect; we propose tomaximize the topic coverage of the paper-reviewer assignment. This objective is new andthe problem based on this objective is shown to be NP-hard. To solve this problemefficiently; we design an approximate algorithm which gives a 1/3-approximation. For thefairness aspect; we perform a detailed study on conflict-of-interest (COI) types and discussseveral issues related to using COI; which; we hope; can raise some open discussions …,Data Mining (ICDM); 2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on,2013,16

Exact top-k nearest keyword search in large networks,Minhao Jiang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract Top-k nearest keyword search has been of interest because of applications rangingfrom road network location search by keyword to search of information on an RDFrepository. We consider the evaluation of a query with a given vertex and a keyword; and theproblem is to find a set of $ k $ nearest vertices that contain the keyword. The knownalgorithms for handling this problem only give approximate answers. In this paper; wepropose algorithms for top-k nearest keyword search that provide exact solutions and whichhandle networks of very large sizes. We have also verified the performance of our solutionscompared with the best-known approximation algorithms with experiments on real datasets.,Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,2015,15
Ginsenoside-Rb1 promotes adipogenesis through regulation of PPARγ and microRNA-27b,L-S Chan; PY-K Yue; T-W Kok; M-H Keung; N-K Mak; RN-S Wong,Ginsenoside-Rb 1 (Rb 1); one of the bioactive components in ginseng extract; is recentlyreported to be able to promote adipogenesis and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorgamma (PPARγ) expression. Meanwhile; microRNA-27b (miR-27b) is also identified toregulate adipogenesis by targeting PPARγ2. In the present study; we attempted to link upthe Rb 1-promoted adipogenesis with PPARγ binding and miR-27b regulation. First; wedemonstrated that GW9662; an antagonist of PPARγ; could block Rb 1-induced 3T3-L1differentiation with little toxicity towards cell proliferation. Then; expression levels for both ofmiR-27b and its primary transcript; pri-mir-27b; were found to decrease upon Rb 1 treatment.Again; GW9662 could attenuate the inhibitory effect of Rb 1 on both miR-27 and pri-mir-27bexpression.

Anonymizing temporal data,Ke Wang; Yabo Xu; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Temporal data are time-critical in that the snapshot at each timestamp must be madeavailable to researchers in a timely fashion. However; due to the limited data; each snapshotlikely has a skewed distribution on sensitive values; which renders classical anonymizationmethods not possible. In this work; we propose the “reposition model” to allow a record to bepublished within a close proximity of original timestamp. We show that reposition over asmall proximity of timestamp is sufficient for reducing the skewness of a snapshot; therefore;minimizing the impact on window queries. We formalize the optimal reposition problem andpresent a linear-time solution. The contribution of this work is that it enables classicalmethods on temporal data.,Data Mining (ICDM); 2010 IEEE 10th International Conference on,2010,15
Fiber optic cable connector,*,A fiber optic cable connector and method provides minimal adhesive wicking and eliminatesdamage to the cladding or coating on fiber optic cables or other damage caused byadhesive wicking. The fiber optic cable connector has a ferrule and a strain relief boot or anovermold flexible material. A flexible adhesive is applied to a cable side of the strain reliefboot to cover the fiber optic cables and fill any voids between the strain relief boot and thefiber optic cables. A rigid adhesive is applied to a terminal side of the strain relief boot to fillany remaining voids. The strain relief boot has the same number of openings as the numberof fiber optic cables being used to eliminate adhesive wicking.

Information based data anonymization for classification utility,Jiuyong Li; Jixue Liu; Muzammil Baig; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract Anonymization is a practical approach to protect privacy in data. The majorobjective of privacy preserving data publishing is to protect private information in datawhereas data is still useful for some intended applications; such as building classificationmodels. In this paper; we argue that data generalization in anonymization should bedetermined by the classification capability of data rather than the privacy requirement. Wemake use of mutual information for measuring classification capability for generalization;and propose two k-anonymity algorithms to produce anonymized tables for buildingaccurate classification models. The algorithms generalize attributes to maximize theclassification capability; and then suppress values by a privacy requirement k (IACk) ordistributional constraints (IACc).

On optimal worst-case matching,Cheng Long; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Philip S Yu; Minhao Jiang,Abstract Bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor (BRNN) queries have been studiedextensively in the literature of spatial databases. Given a set P of service-providers and a setO of customers; a BRNN query is to find which customers in O are" interested" in a givenservice-provider in P. Recently; it has been found that this kind of queries lacks theconsideration of the capacities of service-providers and the demands of customers. In orderto address this issue; some spatial matching problems have been proposed; which;however; cannot be used for some real-life applications like emergency facility allocationwhere the maximum matching cost (or distance) should be minimized. In this paper; wepropose a new problem called Spatial Matching for Minimizing Maximum matching distance(SPM-MM).

Many ofthem concentrate on analyzing the theoretical capacity improvement by using directionalantennas. Other studies focus on designing proper Medium Access Control (MAC) protocolsto improve the practical network throughput. There are few works on the securityimprovement using directional antennas. In this paper; we explore the benefits of directionalantennas in security improvements on both single-hop and multi-hop wireless networks. Inparticular; we found that using directional antennas in wireless networks can significantlyreduce the eavesdropping probabilities of both single-hop transmissions as well as multi-hop transmissions and consequently improve the network security.,Local Computer Networks (LCN); 2011 IEEE 36th Conference on,2011,13

Trajectory simplification: on minimizing the direction-based error,Cheng Long; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; HV Jagadish,Abstract Trajectory data is central to many applications with moving objects. Raw trajectorydata is usually very large; and so is simplified before it is stored and processed. Manytrajectory simplification notions have been proposed; and among them; the direction-preserving trajectory simplification (DPTS) which aims at protecting the direction informationhas been shown to perform quite well. However; existing studies on DPTS require users tospecify an error tolerance which users might not know how to set properly in some cases(eg; the error tolerance could only be known at some future time and simply setting one errortolerance does not meet the needs since the simplified trajectories would usually be used inmany different applications which accept different error tolerances). In these cases; a bettersolution is to minimize the error while achieving a pre-defined simplification size. For this …,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,12

There's more to life than everyday function: the challenge of measuring social role participation in ankylosing spondylitis,Aileen M Davis; Rosalind Wong; Elizabeth M Badley; Monique A Gignac,Abstract Symptoms and functional limitations are commonly reported primary outcomemeasures in ankylosing spondylitis (AS); however; participation has not been widelyevaluated; as reflected by the scarcity of literature on the subject. People with AS suggestthat participation in social roles (eg employment; leisure; and relationships with others) is acritical outcome that is often adversely affected by the sequelae of the disease and by thedemands of managing them. Confusion surrounding the concept of'social roleparticipation'has presented difficulties in defining; developing and using participation as anoutcome measure. Specifically; distinguishing participation in a social role from theperformance of activities that might be associated with that role is critical for measuringparticipation; as the repertoire of associated activities will vary between individuals …,*,2009,12
Analysis of the action of euxanthone; a plant-derived compound that stimulates neurite outgrowth,M Naidu; C-YK Kuan; W-L Lo; M Raza; A Tolkovsky; N-K Mak; RN-S Wong; R Keynes,Abstract We have investigated the neurite growth-stimulating properties of euxanthone; axanthone derivative isolated from the Chinese medicinal plant Polygala caudata.Euxanthone was shown to exert a marked stimulatory action on neurite outgrowth from chickembryo dorsal root ganglia explanted in collagen gels; in the absence of addedneurotrophins. It was also shown to promote cell survival in explanted chick embryo ganglia;and to stimulate neurite outgrowth from isolated adult rat primary sensory neurons in vitro.The further finding that euxanthone stimulates neurite outgrowth from explants of chickembryo retina and ventral spinal cord suggests an action on signaling pathwaysdownstream of neuronal receptors for specific neurotrophic factors. Consistent with this;euxanthone did not promote neurite outgrowth from non-transfected PC12 cells; or from …,Neuroscience,2007,12

Geometry approach for k-regret query,Peng Peng; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Returning tuples that users may be interested in is one of the most important goals for multi-criteria decision making. Top-k queries and skyline queries are two representative queries.A top-k query has its merit of returning a limited number of tuples to users but requires usersto give their exact utility functions. A skyline query has its merit that users do not need to givetheir exact utility functions but has no control over the number of tuples to be returned. In thispaper; we study a k-regret query; a recently proposed query; which integrates the merits ofthe two representative queries. We first identify some interesting geometry properties for thek-regret query. Based on these properties; we define a set of candidate points called happypoints for the k-regret query; which has not been studied in the literature.

Consideringdetailed fault behavior on various circuit elements in a post-layout FPGA application; wedevelop a simulation-based SEU evaluation tool that quantifies fault contribution for eachconfiguration bit. Using this tool and MCNC benchmark circuits; we study the faultcharacteristics of FPGA circuits and architectures. We show that interconnects not onlycontribute to the lion share of functional failures; but also have higher failure rate perconfiguration bit than LUTs. Particularly; multiplexers in local interconnects have the highestfailure rate per bit. We find that tuning LUT and cluster sizes helps to reduce the rate (up to38% in our experiments). In addition; we evaluate two recent fault mitigation algorithms IPDand IPF; which reduce LUT faults by an average of 74% and 15% respectively.

Rotating maxrs queries,Zitong Chen; Yubao Liu; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Jiamin Xiong; Xiuyuan Cheng; Peihuan Chen,Abstract Given a set of weighted objects in a data space; the MaxRS problem in spatialdatabases studied in a VLDB 2012 paper is to find a location for a rectangular region of agiven size such that the weighted sum of all the objects covered by the rectangular regioncentered at the optimal location is maximized. This problem is useful in lots of location-based service applications; such as finding the location for a new fast food restaurant with alimited delivery range attracting the greatest number of customers. The existing MaxRSproblem assumes that the rectangular region is always placed horizontally and is non-rotatable. However; under this assumption; the weighted sum of all the covered objects maynot be the greatest when the rectangular region is rotatable. In this paper; we propose ageneralized MaxRS problem called rotating MaxRS without this assumption. In rotating …,Information Sciences,2015,9

Finding shortest paths on terrains by killing two birds with one stone,Manohar Kaul; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Bin Yang; Christian S Jensen,Abstract With the increasing availability of terrain data; eg; from aerial laser scans; themanagement of such data is attracting increasing attention in both industry and academia. Inparticular; spatial queries; eg; k-nearest neighbor and reverse nearest neighbor queries; inEuclidean and spatial network spaces are being extended to terrains. Such queries all relyon an important operation; that of finding shortest surface distances. However; shortestsurface distance computation is very time consuming. We propose techniques that enableefficient computation of lower and upper bounds of the shortest surface distance; whichenable faster query processing by eliminating expensive distance computations. Empiricalstudies show that our bounds are much tighter than the best-known bounds in many casesand that they enable speedups of up to 43 times for some well-known spatial queries.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013,8
An efficient method for privacy preserving location queries,Yubao Liu; Xiuwei Chen; Zhan Li; Zhijie Li; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract Recently; the issue of privacy preserving location queries has attracted muchresearch.

To tackle this kind of tradeoff; wepropose the privacy persevering location query (PLQ); an efficient privacy preservinglocation query processing framework. This framework can enable the location-based querywithout revealing user location information. The framework can also facilitate location-basedservice providers to collect some information about the location based query; which is usefulin practice.

To the best of ourknowledge; none of them took the lyric into consideration for melody composition. However;according to some recent studies; within a song; there usually exists a certain extent ofcorrelation between its melody and its lyric. In this demonstration; we propose to utilize thistype of correlation information for melody composition. Based on this idea; we design a newmelody composition algorithm and develop a melody composer called T-Music whichemploys this composition algorithm.,Data Engineering (ICDE); 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on,2013,7
Placement of repair circuits for in-field FPGA repair,Michael Wirthlin; Josh Jensen; Alex Wilson; Will Howes; Shi-Jie Wen; Rick Wong,Abstract With the growing density and shrinking feature size of modern semiconductors; it isincreasingly difficult to manufacture defect free semiconductors that maintain acceptablelevels of reliability for long periods of time. These systems are increasingly susceptible towear-out by failing to meet their operational specifications for an extended period of time.The reconfigurability of FPGAs can be used to repair post-manufacturing faults byconfiguring the FPGA to avoid a damaged resource. This paper presents a method forrepairing FPGA devices with wear-out faults by precomputing a set of repair circuits that;collectively; can repair a fault found in any logic block of the FPGA. This approach relies onlogic placement to create" repair" circuits that avoid specific logic blocks. Three repairplacement algorithms will be presented that generate a complete set of repair designs …,Proceedings of the ACM/SIGDA international symposium on Field programmable gate arrays,2013,7

Role of TYR70 in the N-glycosidase activity of neo-trichosanthin,Li Yan; Shen Wu; Hui-Guang Li; Jian-Hui Li; RN-S Wong; Qing-Li Shi; Yi-Cheng Dong,Abstract Trichosanthin (TCS) is a type I ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) which possessesrRNA N-glycosidase activity. TCS has long been used as an abortifacient in China. In recentyears; its immunomodulatory; anti-tumor and anti-HIV properties have attracted more andmore attention. An isoform of trichosanthin; neo-trichosanthin (n-TCS); has been cloned andexpressed as recombinant protein. The biochemical studies revealed that n-TCS hasvirtually the same rRNA N-glycosidase activity as TCS. The crystal structure of n-TCS issimilar to TCS. The crystal of Y70A n-TCS; the mutant of recombinant n-TCS; was soaked insodium citrate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 25% KCl and AMP (10 mg/ml) prior to datacollection. After structure determination and refinement; no electron density corresponding toadenine can be detected around the active pocket. Furthermore; the reaction products of …,Toxicon,1999,7

k-hit query: Top-k query with probabilistic utility function,PENG Peng; Raymong Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract Multi-criteria decision making problem has been well studied for many years. Onepopular query for multi-criteria decision making is top-k queries which require each user tospecify an exact utility function. In many cases; the utility function of a user is probabilisticand finding the distribution on the utility functions has been widely explored in the machinelearning areas; such as user's recommender systems; Bayesian learning models and user'spreference elicitation; for improving user's experience. Motivated by this; we propose a newtype of queries called k-hit queries; which has not been studied before. Given a set D oftuples in the database; the distribution θ on utility functions and a positive integer k; wewould like to select a set of k tuples from D in order to maximize the probability that at leastone of tuples in the selection set is the favorite of a user.

Reconstruction privacy: Enabling statistical learning,Ke Wang; Chao Han; Ada Waichee Fu; Raymond C WONG; Philip S Yu,Abstract Non-independent reasoning (NIR) allows the information about one record in thedata to be learnt from the information of other records in the data. Most posterior/prior basedprivacy criteria consider NIR as a privacy violation and require to smooth the distribution ofpublished data to avoid sensitive NIR. The drawback of this approach is that it limits theutility of learning statistical relationships. The differential privacy criterion considers NIR as anon-privacy violation; therefore; enables learning statistical relationships; but at the cost ofpotential disclosures through NIR. A question is whether it is possible to (1) allow learningstatistical relationships; yet (2) prevent sensitive NIR about an individual. We present a dataperturbation and sampling method to achieve both (1) and (2). The enabling mechanism is anew privacy criterion that distinguishes the two types of NIR in (1) and (2) with the help of …,*,2015,5
Learning on probabilistic labels,Peng Peng; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Phillp S Yu,Abstract Classification is a fundamental topic in the literature of data mining and all recenthot topics like active learning and transfer learning all rely on the concept of classification.Probabilistic information becomes more prevalent nowadays and can be found easily inmany applications like crowdsourcing and pattern recognition. In this paper; we focus on adataset which contains probabilistic information for classification. Based on this probabilisticdataset; we propose a classifier and give a theoretical bound linking the error rate of ourclassifier and the number of instances needed for training. Interestingly; we find that ourtheoretical bound is asymptotically at least no worse than the previously best-known boundsdeveloped based on the traditional dataset. Furthermore; our classifier guarantees a fastrate of convergence compared with traditional classifiers. Experimental results show that …,*,2014,5
Causality and responsibility: Probabilistic queries revisited in uncertain databases,Xiang Lian; Lei Chen,Abstract Recently; due to ubiquitous data uncertainty in many real-life applications; it hasbecome increasingly important to study efficient and effective processing of variousprobabilistic queries over uncertain data; which usually retrieve uncertain objects that satisfyquery predicates with high probabilities. However; one annoying; yet challenging; problemis that; some probabilistic queries are very sensitive to low-quality objects in uncertaindatabases; and the returned query answers might miss some important results (due to lowdata quality). To identify both accurate query answers and those potentially low-qualityobjects; in this paper; we investigate the causes of query answers/non-answers from a novelangle of causality and responsibility (CR); and propose a new interpretation of probabilisticqueries. Particularly; we focus on the problem of CR-based probabilistic nearest neighbor …,Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management,2013,5
Timing vulnerability factors of ultra deep-sub-micron cmos,Massoud Mokhtarpour Ghahroodi; Mark Zwolinski; Rick Wong; Shi-Jie Wen,Soft errors are a significant reliability issue for Ultra Deep-Sub-Micron (UDSM) CMOScircuits. Therefore; an accurate assessment of the Soft Error Rate (SER) is crucial. In thispaper; we argue that the conventional definitions for the Window of Vulnerability (WOV)under-estimate the risk. We propose a new method for determining the timing factors andWOV for the sequential elements from the susceptibility perspective rather than theconventional performance perspective. We also discuss that the process variation does nothave any special impact on the WOV. Our methodology leads to a more realistic definition ofthe WOV for SER computation.,Test Symposium (ETS); 2011 16th IEEE European,2011,5

(α; k)-anonymity based privacy preservation by lossy join,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Yubao Liu; Jian Yin; Zhilan Huang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jian Pei,Abstract Privacy-preserving data publication for data mining is to protect sensitiveinformation of individuals in published data while the distortion to the data is minimized.Recently; it is shown that (α; k)-anonymity is a feasible technique when we are given somesensitive attribute (s) and quasi-identifier attributes. In previous work; generalization of thegiven data table has been used for the anonymization. In this paper; we show that we canproject the data onto two tables for publishing in such a way that the privacy protection for (α;k)-anonymity can be achieved with less distortion. In the two tables; one table contains theundisturbed non-sensitive values and the other table contains the undisturbed sensitivevalues. Privacy preservation is guaranteed by the lossy join property of the two tables. Weshow by experiments that the results are better than previous approaches.,*,2007,5

Monte Carlo simulation of retinal light absorption by infants,Ya Guo; Jinglu Tan,Retinal damage can occur in normal ambient lighting conditions. Infants are particularlyvulnerable to retinal damage; and thousands of preterm infants sustain vision damage eachyear. The size of the ocular fundus affects retinal light absorption; but there is a lack ofunderstanding of this effect for infants. In this work; retinal light absorption is simulated fordifferent ocular fundus sizes; wavelengths; and pigment concentrations by using the MonteCarlo method. The results indicate that the neural retina light absorption per volume forinfants can be two or more times that for adults.,JOSA A,2015,4
Small sum privacy and large sum utility in data publishing,Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Jia Wang; Minhao Jiang,Abstract While the study of privacy preserving data publishing has drawn a lot of interest;some recent work has shown that existing mechanisms do not limit all inferences aboutindividuals. This paper is a positive note in response to this finding. We point out that not allinference attacks should be countered; in contrast to all existing works known to us; andbased on this we propose a model called SPLU. This model protects sensitive information;by which we refer to answers for aggregate queries with small sums; while queries withlarge sums are answered with higher accuracy. Using SPLU; we introduce a sanitizationalgorithm to protect data while maintaining high data utility for queries with large sums.Empirical results show that our method behaves as desired.,Journal of biomedical informatics,2014,4

Approximate logic functions are a promising approach to mitigate such faults asthe technique can be applied to any digital circuit; it protects against multiple fault modelsand offers a trade-off between increased area and fault coverage. In this paper we present anew algorithm for generating approximate logic functions. The algorithm considers thefailure probabilities of the gates and it uses a sum of product (SOP) representation.

Small count privacy and large count utility in data publishing,Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jia Wang; Ke Wang; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract: While the introduction of differential privacy has been a major breakthrough in thestudy of privacy preserving data publication; some recent work has pointed out a number ofcases where it is not possible to limit inference about individuals. The dilemma that isintrinsic in the problem is the simultaneous requirement of data utility in the published data.Differential privacy does not aim to protect information about an individual that can beuncovered even without the participation of the individual. However; this lack of coveragemay violate the principle of individual privacy. Here we propose a solution by providingprotection to sensitive information; by which we refer to the answers for aggregate querieswith small counts. Previous works based on $\ell $-diversity can be seen as providing aspecial form of this kind of protection. Our method is developed with another goal which is …,arXiv preprint arXiv:1202.3253,2012,4
Probabilistic inference protection on anonymized data,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang; Yabo Xu; Jian Pei; S Yu Philip,Background knowledge is an important factor in privacy preserving data publishing.Probabilistic distribution-based background knowledge is a powerful kind of backgroundknowledge which is easily accessible to adversaries. However; to the best of our knowledge;there is no existing work that can provide a privacy guarantee under adversary attack withsuch background knowledge. The difficulty of the problem lies in the high complexity of theprobability computation and the non-monotone nature of the privacy condition. The onlysolution known to us relies on approximate algorithms with no known error bound. In thispaper; we propose a new bounding condition that overcomes the difficulties of the problemand gives a privacy guarantee.

k-Regret Minimizing Set: Efficient Algorithms and Hardness,Wei Cao; Jian Li; Haitao Wang; Kangning Wang; Ruosong Wang; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Wei Zhan,Abstract We study the k-regret minimizing query (k-RMS); which is a useful operator forsupporting multi-criteria decision-making. Given two integers k and r; a k-RMS returns rtuples from the database which minimize the k-regret ratio; defined as one minus the worstratio between the k-th maximum utility score among all tuples in the database and themaximum utility score of the r tuples returned. A solution set contains only r tuples; enjoyingthe benefits of both top-k queries and skyline queries. Proposed in 2012; the query has beenstudied extensively in recent years. In this paper; we advance the theory and the practice ofk-RMS in the following aspects. First; we develop efficient algorithms for k-RMS (and itsdecision version) when the dimensionality is 2.

Quite a number of indexeshave been proposed to answer such distance queries. However; all of these indexes canonly process graphs of size barely up to 1 million vertices; which is rather small in view ofmany of the fast-growing real-world graphs today such as social networks and Web graphs.We propose an efficient index; which is a novel labeling scheme based on the independentset of a graph.

Publishing skewed sensitive microdata,Yabo Xu; Ke Wang; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract A highly skewed microdata contains some sensitive attribute values that occur farmore frequently than others. Such data violates the “eligibility condition” assumed byexisting works for limiting the probability of linking an individual to a specific sensitiveattribute value. Specifically; if the frequency of some sensitive attribute value is too high;publishing the sensitive attribute alone would lead to linking attacks. In many practicalscenarios; however; this eligibility condition is violated. In this paper; we consider how topublish microdata under this case. A natural solution is “minimally” suppressing“dominating” records to restore the eligibility condition. We show that the minimality ofsuppression may lead to linking attacks. To limit the inference probability; we propose arandomized suppression solution. We show that this approach has the least expected …,*,2010,3
Advanced macro-block entropy coding in h. 264,Chi-Wah Wong; Oscar C Au; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Existing video encoders; such as MPEG4; H. 263 and H. 264; adopt variable length coding(VLC) as entropy coding method; focusing on residue data coding. In low bit-rate videocoding; larger quantization parameters are used to give a smaller number of bits spent onresidue data. As a result; the header overhead is a dominant factor of yielding the overall bitrates. In this paper; macro-block (MB) header behavior is investigated. It is found that therelative percentage of the number of bits of MB header increases with quantizationparameter (QP) and header correlation between neighboring MBs is high. Based on theseMB header properties; we propose an advanced coding algorithm for entropy coding of MBheader. The experimental results suggest that our proposed algorithm achieves lower totalnumber of encoded bits over JM10. 2; up to 10% bit reduction; with the same PSNR …,Acoustics; Speech and Signal Processing; 2007.

Real-time rate control via variable frame rate and quantization parameters,Chi-Wah Wong; Oscar C Au; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Hong-Kwai Lam,Abstract Most of existing rate control schemes in the literature focus on the bit allocationunder the assumption of constant frame rate. As a result; the distortion of consecutive framesvaries in a great extent; which may result in low temporal quality (eg flickering effect). In thiswork; we design rate control with two control parameters (ie quantization factor and framerate) to achieve better tradeoff between spatial quality and temporal quality in lowcomplexity. Our optimization gives two suggested quantization step sizes. One is used tochange the frame rate in order to allocate how many bits used in the current frame. Anotherone is used to change the quantization factor in order to quantize MBs to achieve target bitrates. The experimental results suggest that our scheme can achieve more consistent qualitywhile keeping high spatial quality.,Pacific-Rim Conference on Multimedia,2004,3

Minimizing average regret ratio in database,Sepanta Zeighami; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract We propose" average regret ratio" as a metric to measure users' satisfaction after auser sees k selected points of a database; instead of all of the points in the database. Weintroduce the average regret ratio as another means of multi-criteria decision making. Unlikethe original k-regret operator that uses the maximum regret ratio; the average regret ratiotakes into account the satisfaction of a general user. While assuming the existence of someutility functions for the users; in contrast to the top-k query; it does not require a user to inputhis or her utility function but instead depends on the probability distribution of the utilityfunctions. We prove that the average regret ratio is a supermodular function and provide apolynomial-time approximation algorithm to find the average regret ratio minimizing set for adatabase.,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data,2016,2
Generalized bucketization scheme for flexible privacy settings,Ke Wang; Peng Wang; Ada Waichee Fu; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract Bucketization is an anonymization technique for publishing sensitive data. The ideais to group records into small buckets to obscure the record-level association betweensensitive information and identifying information. Compared to the traditional generalizationtechnique; bucketization does not require a taxonomy of attribute values; so is applicable tomore data sets. A drawback of previous bucketization schemes is the uniform privacy settingand uniform bucket size; which often results in a non-achievable privacy goal or excessiveinformation loss if sensitive values have variable sensitivity. In this work; we present aflexible bucketization scheme to address these issues. In the flexible scheme; each sensitivevalue can have its own privacy setting and buckets of different sizes can be formed.

Selective sampling on probabilistic data,Peng Peng; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract In the literature of supervised learning; most existing studies assume that the labelsprovided by the labelers are deterministic; which may introduce noise easily in many real-world applications. In many applications like crowdsourcing; however; many labelers maysimultaneously label the same group of instances and thus the label of each instance isassociated with a probability. Motivated by this observation; we propose a new frameworkwhere each label is enriched with a probability. In this paper; we study an interactivesampling strategy; namely; selective sampling; in which each selected instance is labeledwith a probability. Specifically; we flip a coin every time when we read a new instance anddecide whether it should be labeled according to the flipping result.

Competitive privacy: Secure analysis on integrated sequence data,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Eric Lo,Abstract Sequence data analysis has been extensively studied in the literature. However;most previous work focuses on analyzing sequence data from a single source or party. Inmany applications such as logistics and network traffic analysis; sequence data comes frommore than one source or party. When multiple autonomous organizations collaborate andintegrate their sequence data to perform analysis; sensitive business information ofindividual parties can be easily leaked to the other parties. In this paper; we propose thenotion of competitive privacy to model the privacy that should be protected when carrying outdata analysis on integrated sequence data. We propose a query restriction algorithm thatcan reject malicious queries with low auditing overhead. Experimental results show that ourproposed method guarantees the protection of competitive privacy with only a …,International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications,2010,2

Multidimensional k-anonymization by linear clustering using space-filling curves,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jian Pei; Ke Wang; Steven Chi-Wen Wan; CS Lo,Anonymization has been well-recognized as an effective approach to protect privacy. In thispaper; we study the problem of k-anonymization of numeric data. We propose a simple yeteffective approach to this problem. We transform a data set with a multidimensional numericquasi-identifier into a data set with a one-dimensional numeric quasi-identi er using space-filling curves. Effecacious algorithms are proposed to compute the k-anonymization on thetransformed data set. The k-anonymized data set is then transformed back to the originalmultidimensional space with the k-anonymity preserved. Our empirical studies on both realdata sets and synthetic data sets show that; compared to the state-of-the-art methods; ourmethod achieves a smaller distortion and is more efficient and scalable.,Simon Fraser University School of Computing Science Technical Report,2006,2
Practical indexing XML document for twig query,Hongzhi Wang; Wei Wang; Jianzhong Li; Xuemin Lin; Reymond Wong,Abstract Answering structural queries of XML with index is an important approach of efficientXML query processing. Among existing structural indexes for XML data; F&B index is thesmallest index that can answer all branching queries. However; an F&B index for lessregular XML data often contains a large number of index nodes; and hence a large amountof main memory. If the F&B index cannot be accommodated in the available memory; itsperformance will degrade significantly. This issue has practically limited wider application ofthe F&B index. In this paper; we propose a disk organization method for the F&B index whichshift part of the leave nodes in the F&B index to the disk and organize them judiciously onthe disk. Our method is based on the observation that the majority of the nodes in a F&Bindex is often the leaf nodes; yet their access frequencies are not high.

A client-centred health service model of primary health care and rehabilitation for arthritis,Cheryl Cott; Rachel Devitt; Rosalind Wong; Leslie Soever; Crystal MacKay,Background Rehabilitation services in primary health care (PHC) settings are important forthe treatment of chronic musculoskeletal conditions such as arthritis. However; a number ofstudies point to an underutilization of rehabilitation services for persons with arthritis by PHCphysicians and an unmet need for rehabilitation services reported by persons with arthritis.There is no known cure for arthritis; thus; care for and management of this condition isimportant early in; and over; the course of the disease. PHC rehabilitation professionals offernon-pharmacological interventions that have both a preventive and therapeutic role in themanagement of arthritis. However; explicit service delivery models are lacking thatoperationalize a PHC and rehabilitation approach to arthritis care where rehabilitationprofessionals are working with the client; as well as collaborating and communicating …,*,2005,2
Piecewise linear model for real-time rate control [video coding applications],Chi-Wah Wong; Oscar C Au; RC-W Wong; Hong-Kwai Lam,Most existing rate control schemes in the literature evaluate quantization parameters ofmacro-blocks (MB) based on models which estimate well at low bit rates (eg quadraticmodel). These models are not flexible because this model does not estimate well fordifferent situations with different rates. This work investigates the relationships of the rateand the distortion of a residue MB with two parameters-MB quantization step size andstandard deviation of MB prediction errors. A piecewise linear rate model and lineardistortion model are proposed. Then; we present the proposed rate control scheme basedon these models. The experimental results suggest that our scheme achieves PSNR gainover TMN8 and Li's scheme.,Acoustics; Speech; and Signal Processing; 2005. Proceedings.(ICASSP'05).

Diagnosis of Fracture Damage in Simple Structures: A Modal Method.,Frederick D Ju; Mehmet Akgun; Thomas L Paez; Eric T Wong,Abstract: The present paper explores a method to locate fracture damage in a structure; andto estimate the intensity of the damage. It is noted that when fracture damage occurs in astructure; the modal frequencies of the damaged structure will shift. The perturbations inindividual modal frequencies are governed uniquely by the intensity of the damage and itslocation in the structure. Consequently; when the frequency spectrum of an unflawedstructure is available; field measurement of the structural response after a major event couldlead to an estimate of intensity and location of its damage. The existence of a crack rendersan overall softening effect in the compliance of the structure. The reduction in stiffness canbe quantified by the location and the intensity of the crack. With such a model; the diagnosisof the fracture damage is fundamentally a structural identification. Descriptors:* CRACKS …,*,1982,2

Inherent-Cost Aware Collective Spatial Keyword Queries,Harry Kai-Ho Chan; Cheng Long; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract With the proliferation of spatial-textual data such as location-based services andgeo-tagged websites; spatial keyword queries become popular in the literature. Oneexample of these queries is the collective spatial keyword query (CoSKQ) which is to find aset of objects in the database such that it covers a given set of query keywords collectivelyand has the smallest cost. Some existing cost functions were proposed in the literature;which capture different aspects of the distances among the objects in the set and the query.However; we observe that in some applications; each object has an inherent cost (eg;workers have monetary costs) which are not captured by any of the existing cost functions.Motivated by this; in this paper; we propose a new cost function called the maximum dot sizecost which captures both the distances among objects in a set and a query as existing …,International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases,2017,1

Monochromatic and bichromatic reverse top-k group nearest neighbor queries,Bin Zhang; Tao Jiang; Zhifeng Bao; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Li Chen,Abstract The Group Nearest Neighbor (GNN) search is an important approach for expert andintelligent systems; ie; Geographic Information System (GIS) and Decision Support System(DSS). However; traditional GNN search starts from users' perspective and selects thelocations or objects that users like. Such applications fail to help the managers since they donot provide managerial insights. In this paper; we focus on solving the problem from themanagers' perspective. In particular; we propose a novel GNN query; namely; the reversetop-k group nearest neighbor (RkGNN) query which returns k groups of data objects so thateach group has the query object q as their group nearest neighbor (GNN). This query is animportant tool for decision support; eg; location-based service; product data analysis; tripplanning; and disaster management because it provides data analysts an intuitive way for …,Expert Systems with Applications,2016,1
New lower and upper bounds for shortest distance queries on terrains,Manohar Kaul; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Christian S Jensen,Abstract The increasing availability of massive and accurate laser data enables theprocessing of spatial queries on terrains. As shortest-path computation; an integral elementof query processing; is inherently expensive on terrains; a key approach to enabling efficientquery processing is to reduce the need for exact shortest-path computation in queryprocessing. We develop new lower and upper bounds on terrain shortest distances that areprovably tighter than any existing bounds. Unlike existing bounds; the new bounds do notrely on the quality of the triangulation. We show how use of the new bounds speeds upquery processing by reducing the need for exact distance computations. Speedups of ofnearly an order of magnitude are demonstrated empirically for well-known spatial queries.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2015,1
On percolation connectivity of large scale wireless networks with directional antennas,Hong-Ning Dai; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Wei Zhang; Liqun Fu,We investigate the percolation connectivity of wireless ad hoc networks with directionalantennas (called DIR networks). One of major concerns is to derive bounds on the numberof edge-disjoint directed paths (or highways). However; it is non-trivial to obtain bounds onthe number of directed highways in DIR networks since the conventional undirectedpercolation theory cannot be directly used in DIR networks. In this paper; we exploit thedirected percolation theory to derive bounds on the number of directed highways. Inparticular; we make new constructions in bond directed percolation model. We show thatwith high probability there are at least Ω (√ n/log log√ n) directed highways in a networkwith n nodes; which is much tighter than the existing results in DIR networks.,Personal; Indoor; and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC); 2015 IEEE 26th Annual International Symposium on,2015,1

This was compared to data collected forcases performed without ROSE. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 188 consecutivepatients who underwent EBUS-TBNA from May 2012 to July 2014 whose data was collectedprospectively at the time of the procedure. The presence of a cytologist during ROSEresulted in a significant reduction in the number of lesions sampled [mean: 1.5±0.7 (1; 4)versus 1.9±0.8 (1; 4); P= 0.0020] and the number of TBNAs required per case [mean:3.6±1.4 (1; 8) versus 4.2±1.5 (1; 8); P= 0.0017].

However; we find that (1) theyusually accept very few data formats of terrain data only;(2) they do not support terrainsimplification well which; as will be shown; is used heavily for query processing in spatialdatabases; and (3) they do not provide the surface distance operator which is fundamentalfor many applications based on terrain data. Motivated by this; we developed a tool calledTerrain-Toolkit for terrain data which accepts a comprehensive set of data formats; supportsterrain simplification and provides the surface distance operator.,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014,1
Hypersphere dominance: an optimal approach,Cheng Long; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Bin Zhang; Min Xie,Abstract Hyperspheres are commonly used for representing uncertain objects (in uncertaindatabases) and for indexing spatial objects (in spatial databases). An interesting operator onhyperspheres called dominance is to decide for two given hyperspheres whether onedominates (or is closer than) the other wrt a given query hypersphere. In this paper; wepropose an approach called Hyperbola which is optimal in the sense that it gives neitherfalse positives nor false negatives and runs in linear time wrt the dimensionality. To the bestof our knowledge; Hyperbola is the first optimal approach for the dominance problem onhyperespheres with any dimensionality. We also study an application of the dominanceproblem which relies on the dominance operator as the core component. We conductedextensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets which verified our approaches.,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data,2014,1
Multi-channel wireless networks with infrastructure support: Capacity and delay,Hong-Ning Dai; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Qinglin Zhao,In this paper; we propose a novel multi-channel wireless network with infrastructure support;called an MC-IS network. To the best of our knowledge; we are the first to study the capacityand the delay of such an MC-IS network. In particular; we derive the upper bounds and thelower bounds on the network capacity of such MC-IS networks contributed by ad hoccommunications; where the orders of the upper bounds are the same as the orders of thelower bounds; implying that the bounds are tight. We also found that the capacity of MC-ISnetworks contributed by ad hoc communications is mainly limited by connectivityrequirement; interference requirement; destination-bottleneck requirement and interface-bottleneck requirement. In addition; we also derive the average delay of MC-IS networkscontributed by ad hoc communications; which is bounded by the maximum number of …,Communications (ICC); 2014 IEEE International Conference on,2014,1
Synthesis of redundant combinatorial logic for selective fault tolerance,Hao Xie; Li Chen; Adrian Evans; Shi-Jie Wen; Rick Wong,With shrinking process technologies; the likelihood of mid-life logic faults is increasing. Inthis paper; we present an approach for mitigating the effects of faults in combinatorial logicthrough the selective addition of redundant logic. This approach can be applied to a genericdigital circuit; protects against multiple fault models and offers a trade-off between area andfault coverage. The results show that fault coverage can be improved by 4x with an areapenalty of 50% and only two additional layers of logic.,Dependable Computing (PRDC); 2013 IEEE 19th Pacific Rim International Symposium on,2013,1

SRAM cell reliability degradations due to cell crosstalk,Jongsun Bae; Sanghyeon Baeg; ShiJie Wen; Rick Wong,The capacitance between adjacent SRAM cells due to defectivity can increase in smallergeometry technologies. However; the abnormal behaviors due to such defectivecapacitance in SRAM are often neglected and can cause NTF (No Trouble Found) failures.The effective testing or calibration methods for such capacitance due to defects are noteasily available in today's manufacturing. In this paper; a 3-D field solver was used to seethe potential ranges of the defective capacitance. The crosstalk AC current through thecoupling capacitance; which is referred to as cell coupling capacitor (C CCP) is newlymodeled as a current source to build modified SNM (Static Noise Margin).

Preserving Individual Privacy in Serial Data Publishing,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Jia Liu; Ke Wang; Yabo Xu,Abstract: While previous works on privacy-preserving serial data publishing consider thescenario where sensitive values may persist over multiple data releases; we find that noprevious work has sufficient protection provided for sensitive values that can change overtime; which should be the more common case. In this work we propose to study the privacyguarantee for such transient sensitive values; which we call the global guarantee. Weformally define the problem for achieving this guarantee and derive some theoreticalproperties for this problem. We show that the anonymized group sizes used in the dataanonymization is a key factor in protecting individual privacy in serial publication. Wepropose two strategies for anonymization targeting at minimizing the average group sizeand the maximum group size.

The convergence of the GRP scheme,Matania Ben–Artzi; Joseph Falcovitz; Jiequan Li,Abstract. This paper deals with the convergence of the second-order GRP (GeneralizedRiemann Problem) numerical scheme to the entropy solution for scalar conservation lawswith strictly convex fluxes. The approximate profiles at each time step are linear in each cell;with possible jump discontinuities (of functional values and slopes) across cell boundaries.The basic observation is that the discrete values produced by the scheme are exactaverages of an approximate conservation law; which enables the use of properties of suchsolutions in the proof. In particular; the “total-variation” of the scheme can be controlled;using analytic properties. In practice; the GRP code allows “sawteeth” profiles (ie; thepiecewise linear approximation is not monotone even if the sequences of averages is such).The “reconstruction” procedure considered here also allows the formation of “sawteeth” …,Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems,2009,1
Advanced Real-time Rate Control in H. 264,Chi-Wah Wong; Oscar C Au; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Most existing rate control schemes in the literature use one rate model and calculatequantization parameters of the macro-blocks (MB); regardless of MB types. In advancedvideo coding standards such as H. 264; MBs belong to more advanced MB types; such asskipped and non-skipped MBs. In non-skipped MBs; the encoder determines whether eachof 8times8 luminance sub-blocks and 4times4 chrominance sub-block of a MB is to beencoded; giving the different number of sub-blocks at each MB encoding times. As a result; atraditional single rate model is insufficient to represent each MB accurately. In this work; it isfound that different MB types have different rate behavior. Under different conditions of MBtypes; we establish novel different rate models and distortion models. Our rate controlscheme is proposed based on these models.

Wavelet analysis is introduced to extract signal spectrographic characteristics in thetime-scale domain appropriately. Since the propagation characteristics of Lamb wave isaltered by the existence of damage in the composite laminates; delamination informationcan be obtained from the received signal.

The exploration of new antiangiogenic agents would behelpful in antitumour therapy. Quinoline is an aromatic nitrogen compound characterized bya double-ring structure which exhibits a benzene ring fused to pyridine at two adjacentcarbon atoms. The high stability of quinoline makes it preferable in a variety of therapeuticand pharmaceutical applications; including antitumour treatment. This work is to examinethe potential antiangiogenic activity of the synthetic compound 2-Formyl-8-hydroxy-quinolinium chloride.

A Melody Composer for both Tonal and Non-Tonal Languages,Coleman Yu; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,ABSTRACT Song consisting of a melody part and a lyric part is very important to human.Song is more informative than a instrumental composition. People want to have their ownsongs for their special days. However; composing a song is difficult to people without musicbackground because it requires some music knowledge and some composition writingskills. There is an algorithmic melody composer called “T-Music”; which finds (or mines) thecorrelations between the melodies and the lyrics and uses these correlations to compose amelody for the input lyrics. These correlations are represented in frequent patterns (fps). Thispaper presents the ways of enhancing T-Music. The original T-Music can only mine fps fromsongs. We propose two new methods to mine fps from instrumental compositions. We alsointroduce an optimal way of using fps mined from songs in one language to compose a …,*,2016,*

Reflective space: The medical library as a mindfulness sanctuary,PY Wong; JY Chen; LC Chan,Like their fellow medical students around the world; at the University of Hong Kong (HKU);medical students' minds are also occupied with acronyms for differential diagnoses;timetables; lunch plans; their Facebook pages; and the incessant inner chatter that clutterminds. Mindfulness is an increasingly evidence-based approach to de-cluttering of the mind;bringing about present moment awareness; and enabling attention in difficult situations. Itcan be practiced in any setting but is best facilitated in a physical space that mirrors thepeace and calm being sought. Thus; the natural coupling of a deliberately designatedreflective space in the library for such practice is presented as a fresh approach to reflection.,Keeping Reflection Fresh: A Practical Guide for Clinical Educators,2016,*
Association of infant growth and pubertal adiposity: implications for future cardiovascular health and immunological benefits,LL Hui; Catherine Mary Schooling; Michelle Heys; Man Yu Wong,Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the world. Infancy is a keywindow of developmental plasticity and intervention; but the role of foetal and infant growthin cardiovascular disease remains controversial. We have reported a positive association ofinfant growth with body mass index (BMI) at age 7 years; 1 in the Children of 1997 birthcohort in Hong Kong. 2 Nonetheless; BMI in childhood may not track into adulthood andrepresents an unknown combination of muscle mass and fat mass. This study aimed to usethe same birth cohort to clarify the association of infant growth with adiposity in adolescencein terms of both BMI and waist ratios; and to assess the association of infant growth andhospital use due to infections.,Hong Kong Medical Journal,2015,*
Trend-MC: A Melody Composer by Constructing from Frequent Trend-Based Patterns,Cheng Long; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Raymond Ka Wai Sze,Algorithmic composition refers to the process of composing a melody automatically usingalgorithms. A bulk of methods have been proposed for this task. Among them; a novel idea isto utilize the correlation information between the pitches of melodies and the tones of lyricsfor melody composition. Unfortunately; the existing method adopting this idea suffers fromseveral severe shortcomings and thus the merits of the above idea are not fully utilized. Inthis paper; we propose a new technique to capture the above correlation information basedon the concepts of pitch trends and tone trends. Based on this technique; we design a newalgorithm called Trend-MC for melody composition which avoids the shortcomings of theexisting method. We also developed a software with the Trend-MC algorithm as its core. Wedemonstrate that the software could compose nice melodies with the input of lyrics.,Data Mining Workshop (ICDMW); 2015 IEEE International Conference on,2015,*

Workflow-based service selection under multi-constraints,Chao Xia; Chi-Hung Chi; Raymond Wong; Andreas Wombacher; Luis F Pires; Marten van Sinderen; Chen Ding,Despite the availability of services with similar functionality but from different providers in thecloud; using them in a workflow might subject to constraints such as service QoS and servicebundling. Service bundling refers to the situation where the subscription of two serviceshave to be done together; such requirement might be imposed by service providers and/orby the alliance group that the providers join in. In this paper; we focus on the serviceselection problem under the QoS constraints from the user and the bundling constraintsassociated with the chosen services. We first formulate the service selection problem as amulti-constrained selection problem. Then we propose a recursive heuristic searchalgorithm that takes the required QoS and bundling constraints into consideration for serviceselection.

Spatial Matching,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong,Given two sets of objects each with a location; a spatial matching is a matching between oneset P of objects and another set O of objects such that a cost measuring the “goodness” ofthis matching is optimized. Given two sets of objects; a matching is a mapping from objectsfrom one set to objects of another set such that each object in one set is mapped to at mostone object in another set. The “goodness” of a matching can be measured by a certaincriterion (in terms of a cost function). In general; when we match an object p in one set P withanother object o in another set O; we associate this matching with a cost cp; o/. In differentapplications; cp; o/has different meanings. For example; in some time-critical applications;cp; o/denotes the travel time between p and o. In some distance-driven applications; cp;o/denotes the shortest distance between p and o.

A comprehensive soft error analysis tool for core networking system,Haihong Zhu; Rick Wong; Shijie Wen,In this paper; we developed a comprehensive single-event upset (SEU) analysis tool. Toachieve this goal we start by defining the SEU mitigation strategy as a combination of chiplevel methods and system level methods. Given a particular SEU chip level and/or systemlevel mitigation choice; we propose first categorizing the SEU Failure In Time (FIT) intodifferent time window bins based on SEU recovery time. Then we analyze the impact of eachmitigation strategy; results in the FIT value change in each bin. This tool enables theengineers to do the SEU mitigation design in early design phase. A user-friendly Excelformat is also developed to make the complicated model easy to use. The system can bemodeled using the tool at an early stage to support design decisions and trade-offs relatedto potentially costly mitigation strategies.,Reliability Physics Symposium (IRPS); 2013 IEEE International,2013,*

Inferential or Differential: Privacy Laws Dictate,Ke Wang; Peng Wang; Ada Waichee Fu; Raywong Chi-Wing Wong,Abstract: So far; privacy models follow two paradigms. The first paradigm; termed inferentialprivacy in this paper; focuses on the risk due to statistical inference of sensitive informationabout a target record from other records in the database. The second paradigm; known asdifferential privacy; focuses on the risk to an individual when included in; versus when notincluded in; the database. The contribution of this paper consists of two parts. The first partpresents a critical analysis on differential privacy with two results:(i) the differential privacymechanism does not provide inferential privacy;(ii) the impossibility result about achievingDalenius's privacy goal [5] is based on an adversary simulated by a Turing machine; but ahuman adversary may behave differently; consequently; the practical implication of theimpossibility result remains unclear.

Because of these materials' immediate contact or close proximity to active areas ofthe silicon; even small increase in alpha emissivity may have significant impact on theperformance of the device. In this work; we present the analytical steps to identify materialsand manufacturing steps that caused high soft error rates for flip chip devices. We will alsopresent some experimental results to highlight the impact of assembly process control. Theresults from these studies suggest that to minimize the impact of alpha emission frompackaging materials; material set selection and assembly process control must beaddressed simultaneously to ensure robust device performance.,ASME 2009 InterPACK Conference collocated with the ASME 2009 Summer Heat Transfer Conference and the ASME 2009 3rd International Conference on Energy Sustainability,2009,*

Query by Humming,Yingyi Bu; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu,In general; the term Quadtree refers to a class of representations of geometric entities (suchas points; line segments; polygons; regions) in a space of two (or more) dimensions; thatrecursively decompose the space containing these entities into blocks until the data in eachblock satisfy some condition (with respect; for example; to the block size; the number of blockentities; the characteristics of the block entities; etc.). In a more restricted sense; the termQuadtree (Octree) refers to a tree data-structure in which each internal node has four (eight)children and is used for the representation of geometric entities in a two (three) dimensionalspace. The root of the tree represents the whole space/region. Each child of a noderepresents a subregion of the subregion of its parent.

Method for assembly of multi-ports optical apparatus,*,The present invention describes a structure and method for a multi-ports WDM device forcompensating the filter distortion while reducing insertion loss. The multi-ports WDM devicecomprises a 4-fiber collimator having a grin lens and a 2-fiber collimator having a lenswhere the focal plane of the second lens is shorter than the focal plane of the first grin lensAnds with aspheric surface. When a light signal travels through the first lens in the 4-fibercollimator to a filter; the film on the filter causes distortion to the light signal resulting in alarge insertion loss. To compensate for the insertion loss; the lens on the 2-fiber collimatorhas a aspheric function and a shorter focal plane than the grin lens on the 4-fiber collimator.The type of grin lens used in the 4-fiber collimator is different than the lens used in the 2-fibercollimator.

Contemporary Confucianism in East Asia,Yiu-ming Fung,For contemporary Neo-Confucians as well as traditional Neo-Confucians (ie Song-MingConfucians); Confucianism is more than Confucian studies. They thought that Confucianteaching is some kind of practical wisdom and transcendental truth which cannot beunderstood by any objective and logical methods. They stressed that there is some kind ofessential difference between Chinese philosophy and Western philosophy in the sense thatthey are incommensurable to each other. They also stressed that to understand this wisdomand truth is the same as to enter into a realm of transcendental experience which can onlybe accessed by some kind of intellectual or mystical intuition after doing a series of difficultand serious moral practices. Just like the Song-Ming Confucians; most of the representativesof the first generation of contemporary Neo-Confucianism used Buddhist conceptual …,Journal of Nanjing University (Philosophy; Humanities and Social Sciences),2007,*
Optimal Transportation Supply and Demand Management over Time,Barbara WY Siu; H Lo,Abstract Including both transportation supply and demand management (TS-DM) measuresunderpins the development of an effective transportation management strategy. One mayconsider transportation infrastructure provision as the supply; whereas the traveling publicas the demand; subject to demand management measures which are often introduced as aseparate policy tool; distinct from supply management. Nevertheless; synergy can beachieved in solving congestion problems when TS-DM strategies are developed jointly in anintegrated manner. This paper focuses on developing a bi-level formulation in determiningthe time-dependent TS-DM strategy. General properties of the formulation are discussedand an illustrative network example is given.,11th World Conference on Transport ResearchWorld Conference on Transport Research Society,2007,*

Linear Real-time Rate Control,Wong Chi Wah; Oscar C Au; Raymond CW Wong; Lam Hong Kwai,Most existing rate control schemes in the literature calculated quantisation parameters of themacro-blocks (MB) based on the standard deviation of the residue before quantisation. Wefound that some factors after quantisation (eg probability of non-zero quantised coefficients;standard deviation of quantised coefficients; mean absolute difference of quantisedcoefficients (MAD') divided by standard deviation before quantisation; Context-basedAdaptive Variable Length Coding (CAVLC)) were new factors; having an interesting propertythat the rate tended to be linear with those factors. This work investigated the relationship ofbit rate and distortion with MB quantisation step size and these factors. Then we establishedrate and distortion models with MB quantisation step size and these factors.

Hierarchical Decomposition of Architectural Computer Models,J Bradford; R Wong; CSK Yeung,summary Architectural models can be represented in a hierarchy of complexity. Higher levelor more complex architecture structures are then designed by repetitively instantiatinglibraries of building blocks. The advantages are that the object can be achieved in modularfashion and any modification to the definition of a building block can be easily propagated toall higher level objects using the block. Unfortunately; many existing representations ofarchitectural models are monolithic instead of hierarchical and modular; thus; making thereuse of models very difficult and inefficient. This paper describes a research project ondeveloping a tool to decompose a monolithic architectural model into elementary buildingblocks and then create a hierarchy in the model representation. The tool provides agraphical interface for the visualization of a model and a cutting plane. An associated …,*,1997,*

Recently; chief providers of cloud service like Amazon and Microsoft did notsucceed in earning the revenues they initially expected to get; because of the unforeseenshutdown of the government budget [3]. One of the main reasons for this deficit in theexpected revenue is due to the inflexibility of these organizations to contract and expand theresources based on the client requirements.

k-Regret Minimizing Set: Hardness and Efficient Algorithms,Wei Cao; Jian Li; Haitao Wang; Kangning Wang; Ruosong Wang; Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Wei Zhan,ABSTRACT We study the k-regret minimizing query (k-RMS); which is a useful operator ofsupporting multi-criteria decision-making. Given two integers k and r; a k-RMS returns rtuples from the database which minimize the k-regret ratio; defined as one minus the worstratio between the k-th maximum utility score among all tuples in the database and themaximum utility score of the r tuples returned. A solution set contains only r tuples; enjoyingthe benefits of both top-k queries and skyline queries. Since proposed in 2012; the queryhas been studied extensively in recent years. In this paper; we advance the theory and thepractice of k-RMS in the following aspects. First; we develop efficient algorithms for k-RMS(and its decision version) when the dimensionality is 2.

The AIRS conferences aim to bring together international researchersand developers to exchange new ideas and the latest results in information retrieval. AIRS2010 continues the conference series that grew from the Information Retrieval with AsianLanguages (IRAL) workshop series; started in 1996. It has become a mature venue forinformation retrieval work; finding support from the ACM Special Interest Group onInformation Retrieval (SIGIR); the Association for Computational Linguistics and ChineseLanguage Processing (ACLCLP) and the Information Processing Society of Japan; SpecialInterest Group on Information Fundamentals and Access Technologies (IPSJ SIG-IFAT). Thisyear saw a sharp rise in the number of submissions over the previous year. A total of 120 …,*,*,*

Analyzing Integrated Sequence Data in a Competitive Environment,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Eric Lo,Abstract—Today; many organizations are collaborating in certain businesses but competingin others. They may provide “similar” or “competitive” services to customers. When multipleautonomous organizations collaborate and integrate their data to perform analysis; sensitivebusiness information of individual parties such as the information about the competitiveservices can be easily leaked to the other parties during the process. Once a party knowsthis sensitive information of the other party; it can do something bad to this party. Thissensitive information is considered as the (competitive) privacy of the parties. In this paper;we propose to prevent any party from inferring the sensitive information of all other partiesover the integrated data. We propose and develop a query restriction strategy calledcompetition-free for this problem. We show that this strategy protects competitive privacy …,*,*,*
Noname manuscript No.(will be inserted by the editor),Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Jiuyong Li; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang,Abstract Privacy preservation is an important issue in the release of data for miningpurposes. The k-anonymity model has been introduced for protecting individualidentification. Recent studies show that a more sophisticated model is necessary to protectthe association of individuals to sensitive information. In this paper; we propose an (α; k)-anonymity model to protect both identifications and relationships to sensitive information indata. We discuss the properties of (α; k)-anonymity model. We prove that the optimal (α; k)-anonymity problem is NP-hard. We first present an optimal global-recoding method for the(α; k)-anonymity problem. Next we propose two scalable local-recoding algorithms whichare both more scalable and result in less data,*,*,*
Minimality Attack in Privacy Preserving Data Publishing Technical Report TR 2006-28,Raymond Chi-Wing Wong; Ada Wai-Chee Fu; Ke Wang; Jian Pei,Abstract Data publishing generates much concern over the protection of individual privacy.In the well-known kanonymity model and the related models such as l-diversity and (α; k)-anonymity; the adversary is assumed to possess knowledge about an external table withinformation of the quasi-identifiers of individuals. In this paper; we show that knowledge ofthe mechanism or algorithm of anonymization for data publication can also lead to extrainformation that assists the adversary and jeopardizes individual privacy. In particular; allknown mechanisms try to minimize information loss and such an attempt provides for aloophole for attacks. We call such an attack a minimality attack. In this paper; we propose amodel called mconfidentiality which deals with the individual privacy issue with theconsideration of minimality attacks. Though the problem of optimal m-confidentiality …,*,*,*
