Effects of the strain relaxation of an AlGaN barrier layer induced by various cap layers on the transport properties in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures,Liu Zi-Yang; Zhang Jin-Cheng; Duan Huan-Tao; Xue Jun-Shuai; Lin Zhi-Yu; Ma Jun-Cai; Xue Xiao-Yong; Hao Yue,Abstract The strain relaxation of an AlGaN barrier layer may be influenced by a thin caplayer above; and affects the transport properties of AlGaN/GaN heterostructures. Comparedwith the slight strain relaxation found in AlGaN barrier layer without cap layer; it is found thata thin cap layer can induce considerable changes of strain state in the AlGaN barrier layer.The degree of relaxation of the AlGaN layer significantly influences the transport propertiesof the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures. It is observedthat electron mobility decreases with the increasing degree of relaxation of the AlGaNbarrier; which is believed to be the main cause of the deterioration of crystalline quality andmorphology on the AlGaN/GaN interface. On the other hand; both GaN and AlN cap layerslead to a decrease in 2DEG density. The reduction of 2DEG caused by the GaN cap layer …,Chinese Physics B,2011,17
Stress and morphology of a nonpolar a-plane GaN layer on r-plane sapphire substrate,Xu Sheng-Rui; Hao Yue; Zhang Jin-Cheng; Xue Xiao-Yong; Li Pei-Xian; Li Jian-Ting; Lin Zhi-Yu; Liu Zi-Yang; Ma Jun-Cai; He Qiang; Lü Ling,Abstract The anisotropic strain of a nonpolar (11 bar 2 0) a-plane GaN epilayer on an r-plane (1 bar 1 02) sapphire substrate; grown by low-pressure metal-organic vapourdeposition is investigated by Raman spectroscopy. The room-temperature Raman scatteringspectra of nonpolar a-plane GaN are measured in surface and edge backscatteringgeometries. The lattice is contracted in both the c-and the m-axis directions; and the stress inthe m-axis direction is larger than that in the c-axis direction. On the surface of this sample; anumber of cracks appear only along the m-axis; which is confirmed by the scanning electronmicrograph. Atomic force microscopy images reveal a significant decrease in the root-mean-square roughness and the density of submicron pits after the stress relief.,Chinese Physics B,2011,15
Characteristics of AlGaN/GaN/AlGaN double heterojunction HEMTs with an improved breakdown voltage,Ma Juncai; Zhang Jincheng; Xue Junshuai; Lin Zhiyu; Liu Ziyang; Xue Xiaoyong; Ma Xiaohua; Hao Yue,Abstract We studied the performance of AlGaN/GaN double heterojunction high electronmobility transistors (DH-HEMTs) with an AlGaN buffer layer; which leads to a higherpotential barrier at the backside of the two-dimensional electron gas channel and bettercarrier confinement. This; remarkably; reduces the drain leakage current and improves thedevice breakdown voltage. The breakdown voltage of AlGaN/GaN double heterojunctionHEMTs (~ 100 V) was significantly improved compared to that of conventional AlGaN/GaNHEMTs (~ 50 V) for the device with gate dimensions of 0.5× 100 μm and a gate—draindistance of 1 μm. The DH-HEMTs also demonstrated a maximum output power of 7.78W/mm; a maximum power-added efficiency of 62.3% and a linear gain of 23 dB at the drainsupply voltage of 35 V at 4 GHz.,Journal of Semiconductors,2012,14
Comparative Study of the Characteristics of the Basal Plane Stacking Faults of Nonpolar a-Plane and Semipolar (112̄2) GaN,Xu Sheng-Rui; Lin Zhi-Yu; Xue Xiao-Yong; Liu Zi-Yang; Ma Jun-Cai; Jiang Teng; Mao Wei; Wang Dang-Hui; Zhang Jin-Cheng; Hao Yue,Abstract Nonpolar (11 bar 2 0) and semipolar (11 bar 2 2) GaN are grown on r-plane and m-plane sapphire by MOCVD to investigate the characteristics of basal plane stacking faults(BSFs). Transmission electron microscopy reveals that the density of BSFs for the semipolar(11 bar 2 2) and nonpolar a-plane GaN template is 3× 10 5 cm− 1 and 8× 10 5 cm− 1;respectively. The semipolar (11 bar 2 2) GaN shows an arrowhead-like structure; and thenonpolar a-plane GaN has a much smoother morphology with a streak along the c-axis.Both nonpolar (11 bar 2 0) and semipolar (11 bar 2 2) GaN have very strong BSFluminescence due to the optically active character of the BSFs.,Chinese Physics Letters,2012,12
Effect of Si doping in wells of AlGaN/GaN superlattice on the characteristics of epitaxial layer,Zhang Wei; Xue Jun-Shuai; Zhou Xiao-Wei; Zhang Yue; Liu Zi-Yang; Zhang Jin-Cheng; Hao Yue,Abstract An AlGaN/GaN superlattice grown on the top of a GaN buffer induces thebroadening of the full width at half maximum of (102) and (002) X-ray diffraction rockingcurves. With an increase in the Si-doped concentration in the GaN wells; the full width at halfmaximum of the (102) rocking curves decreases; while that of the (002) rocking curvesincreases. A significant increase of the full width at the half maximum of the (002) rockingcurves when the doping concentration reaches 2.5× 10 19 cm− 3 indicates the substantialincrease of the inclined threading dislocation. High level doping in the AlGaN/GaNsuperlattice can greatly reduce the biaxial stress and optimize the surface roughness of thestructures grown on the top of it.,Chinese Physics B,2012,9
Improvement of (1122) Semipolar GaN Crystal Quality with TiN Interlayer by Metal Organic Vapor Phase Epitaxy,Sheng Rui Xu; Yue Hao; Lin An Yang; Jin Cheng Zhang; Jun Shuai Xue; Xiao Yong Xue; Zi Yang Liu; Zhi Yu Lin; Jun Cai Ma; Pei Xian Li; Jian Ting Li; Qiang He,Abstract The effect of a TiN interlayer on the crystalline quality of (1122) semipolar GaNgrown on m-plane sapphire was studied by high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD).Before GaN growth; a TiN interlayer was formed by nitrided the Ti metal on the GaN seedlayer. Symmetric and skew-symmetric HRXRD measurements demonstrate that boththreading dislocation and basal plane stacking fault densities are reduced. Raman resultsalso show an increased crystalline quality and a decreased threading dislocationdensity.(1122) semipolar GaN with an optimal Ti thickness of 2 nm has been obtained underthe existing growth conditions.,Japanese Journal of Applied Physics,2011,9

Effect of defects on strain state in nonpolar a-plane GaN,ZY Liu; SR Xu; JC Zhang; JS Xue; XY Xue; MT Niu; Y Hao,Abstract We have investigated the influence of basal stacking fault (BSF) and impurityrelated defect on the strain state of a-plane GaN epilayers. Four a-plane GaN epilayers weregrown on r-plane sapphire using different growth strategies by metalorganic chemical vapordeposition. It is found that with a growing number of stacking fault; both the anisotropic in-plane strain and compressive out-plane strain along c-axis are relieved. Epitaxial lateralovergrowth with a TiN interlayer is an effective way to relieve in-plane strain and reduce BSFdensity. The extrapolated lattice parameters free of biaxial strain increase with thenormalized yellow luminescence intensity. Hydrostatic strain induced by impurity-relateddefects is the possible cause of this phenomenon.,Journal of Crystal Growth,2012,5
Quantitative Method to Determine Planar Defect Frequency in InAs Nanowires by High Resolution X-ray Diffraction,Ziyang Liu; Clement Merckling; Matty Caymax; Rita Rooyackers; Nadine Collaert; Aaron Thean; Olivier Richard; Hugo Bender; Wilfried Vandervorst; Marc Heyns,The ongoing study of {111} planar defects (PDs) in III–V nanowires (NWs) entails a fast andquantitative characterization method beyond transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Wereport here a simple and reliable method to calculate the PD frequency in InAs NWs using alab X-ray diffractometer. The fact that the PD distribution is location independent andirrelevant to the NWs diameter in catalyst-free InAs NWs epitaxy makes PD frequency globalcalculation possible. We demonstrated that the PDs follow a geometric distribution in NWs.As a consequence; applying a 1D disordered layers diffraction model; we relate thediffraction peak angle directly to the PD frequency. The calculated PD frequency values arein good agreement with that extracted from high resolution TEM analysis. As an example; weapplied this method to study the influence of growth temperature on PD frequencies in the …,Cryst. Growth Des,2015,4
Temperature dependences of Raman scattering in different types of GaN epilayers,Xue Xiao-Yong; Xu Sheng-Rui; Zhang Jin-Cheng; Lin Zhi-Yu; Ma Jun-Cai; Liu Zi-Yang; Xue Jun-Shuai; Hao Yue,Abstract First-order Raman scatterings of hexagonal GaN layers deposited by the hydridevapour phase epitaxy and by metal-organic chemical vapour deposition on SiC andsapphire substrates are studied in a temperature range between 303 K and 503 K. Thetemperature dependences of two GaN Raman modes (A 1 (LO) and E 2 (high)) areobtained. We focus our attention on the temperature dependence of E 2 (high) mode andfind that for different types of GaN epilayers their temperature dependences are somewhatdifferent. We compare their differences and give them an explanation. The simplifiedformulas we obtained are in good accordance with experiment data. The results can beused to determine the temperature of a GaN sample.,Chinese Physics B,2012,2

Correlation between surface reconstruction and polytypism in InAs nanowire selective area epitaxy,Ziyang Liu; Clement Merckling; Rita Rooyackers; Olivier Richard; Hugo Bender; Yves Mols; María Vila; Juan Rubio-Zuazo; Germán R. Castro; Nadine Collaert; Aaron Thean; Wilfried Vandervorst; Marc Heyns,Abstract The mechanism of widely observed intermixing of wurtzite and zinc-blende crystalstructures in InAs nanowire (NW) grown by selective area epitaxy (SAE) is studied. Wedemonstrate that the crystal structure in InAs NW grown by SAE can be controlled usingbasic growth parameters; and wurtzitelike InAs NWs are achieved. We link the polytypic InAsNWs SAE to the reconstruction of the growth front (111) B surface. Surface reconstructionstudy of InAs (111) substrate and the following homoepitaxy experiment suggest that (111)planar defect nucleation is related to the (1× 1) reconstruction of InAs (111) B surface. Inorder to reveal it more clearly; a model is presented to correlate growth temperature andarsenic partial pressure with InAs NW crystal structure. This model considers the transitionbetween (1× 1) and (2× 2) surface reconstructions in the frame of adatom atoms …,Phys. Rev. Materials,2017,*
