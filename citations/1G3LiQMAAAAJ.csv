HotSpot: A compact thermal modeling methodology for early-stage VLSI design,Wei Huang; Shougata Ghosh; Sivakumar Velusamy; Karthik Sankaranarayanan; Kevin Skadron; Mircea R Stan,This paper presents HotSpot-a modeling methodology for developing compact thermalmodels based on the popular stacked-layer packaging scheme in modern very large-scaleintegration systems. In addition to modeling silicon and packaging layers; HotSpot includesa high-level on-chip interconnect self-heating power and thermal model such that thethermal impacts on interconnects can also be considered during early design stages. TheHotSpot compact thermal modeling approach is especially well suited for preregister transferlevel (RTL) and presynthesis thermal analysis and is able to provide detailed static andtransient temperature information across the die and the package; as it is alsocomputationally efficient.,IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems,2006,786

Wethen propose a compact thermal model which can be integrated with modern CAD tools toachieve a temperature-aware design methodology. Finally; we use the compact thermalmodel in a case study of microprocessor design to show the importance of usingtemperature as a guideline for the design.

Many-core design from a thermal perspective,Wei Huang; Mircea R Stan; Karthik Sankaranarayanan; Robert J Ribando; Kevin Skadron,Abstract Air cooling limits have been a major design challenge in recent years for integratedcircuits. Multi-core exacerbates thermal challenges because power scales with the numberof cores; but also creates new opportunities for temperature-aware design; because multi-core designs offer more design parameters than single-core designs. This paperinvestigates the relationship between core size and on-chip hot spot temperature and showsthat with the same power density; smaller cores are cooler than larger cores due to a spatiallow-pass filtering effect of temperature. This phenomenon suggests that designs exploitinglow-pass filtering can dissipate more power within the same cooling budget thancontemporary designs.,Design Automation Conference; 2008.

An improved block-based thermal model in HotSpot 4.0 with granularity considerations,Wei Huang; Karthik Sankaranarayanan; Robert J Ribando; Mircea R Stan; Kevin Skadron,Abstract This technical report describes our most recent improvements to the HotSpotthermal model. First; in response to a previous paper in WDDD 2006 [1] that cites someaccuracy shortcomings; we improve treatment in HotSpot's “block model” of high aspect-ratioblocks; high power densities; and convection boundary conditions. These improvements areincluded in the newest release of the HotSpot software; version 4.0. 1 Second; to help guideusers' modeling efforts and choice of modeling resolution; we propose an analyticalapproach to find the relationship between the power modeling granularity and theassociated peak temperature rise at that granularity; ie the relationship between the size andpeak temperature of a uniform heat source.

Adaptive cache decay using formal feedback control,Sivakumar Velusamy; Karthik Sankaranarayanan; Dharmesh Parikh; Tarek Abdelzaher; Kevin Skadron,Abstract This paper argues that adaptive techniques in processor architecture should bedesigned using formal feedback-control theory. We use the derivation of a controller forcache decay—a technique for leakage-energy savings—to illustrate the process of formalfeedback-control design and to show the benefits of feedback control. Control theoryprovides a powerful framework that simplifies the task of designing an adaptive system. Itprovides well-known control designs that are easy to tune for performance and stability.Open-loop adaptation; on the other hand; is vulnerable to unacceptable behaviors whenpresented with workloads or conditions that were not anticipated at design time. In contrast;feedback control responds to unanticipated behaviors and provides robust operation incases where open-loop designs fail.

Profile-based adaptation for cache decay,Karthik Sankaranarayanan; Kevin Skadron,Abstract" Cache decay" is a set of leakage-reduction mechanisms that put cache lines thathave not been accessed for a specific duration into a low-leakage standby mode. Thisduration is called the decay interval; and its optimal value varies across applications. Thispaper describes an adaptation technique that analytically finds the optimal decay intervalthrough profiling; and shows that the most important variables required for finding theoptimal decay interval can be estimated with a reasonable degree of accuracy usingprofiling. This work explicitly trades off the leakage power saved in putting both the" live"and" dead" lines into standby mode; against its performance and energy costs. It achievesenergy savings close to what can be obtained with an omniscient choice of per-benchmarkoptimal decay interval.,ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization (TACO),2004,18

Architectural implications of spatial thermal filtering,Karthik Sankaranarayanan; Brett H Meyer; Wei Huang; Robert Ribando; Hossein Haj-Hariri; Mircea R Stan; Kevin Skadron,Abstract Process technology scaling; lagging supply voltage scaling; and the resultingexponential increase in power density; have made temperature a first-class designconstraint in today's microprocessors. Prior work has shown that the silicon substrate acts asa spatial low-pass filter for temperature. This phenomenon; spatial thermal filtering; has clearimplications for thermal management: depending on the size of dissipators; either design-time strategies; such as dividing and distributing functionality spatially; or runtime strategies;such as isolating functionality temporally (duty cycling); may be the most effective way tocontrol peak temperature.

Thermal modeling and management of microprocessors,Karthik Sankaranarayanan,Abstract The most recent; and arguably one of the most difficult obstacles to the exponentialgrowth in transistor density predicted by Moore's Law is that of removing the large amount ofheat generated within the tiny area of a microprocessor. The exponential increase in powerdensity and its direct relation to on-chip temperature have; in recent processors; led to veryhigh cooling costs. Since temperature also has an exponential effect on lifetime reliabilityand leakage power; it has become a first-class design constraint in microprocessordevelopment akin to performance.

Granularity of microprocessor thermal management: a technical report,Karthik Sankaranarayanan; Wei Huang; Mircea R Stan; Hossein Haj-Hariri; Robert J Ribando; Kevin Skadron,Abstract Process technology scaling; poor supply voltage scaling and the resultantexponential increase in power density have made temperature a first-class design constraintin today's microprocessors. An interesting question in the context of thermal managementand multi-core architectures is about the correct size granularity of thermal management. It isknown that the silicon substrate acts as a spatial low-pass filter for temperature. This meansthat if blocks with very high power density are small enough (for eg; if they are below a “cut-off” size); they do not cause hot spots.
