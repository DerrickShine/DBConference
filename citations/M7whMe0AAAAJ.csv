Direct comparison of stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture and spectral counting for quantitative proteomics,Timothy S Collier; Prasenjit Sarkar; William L Franck; Balaji M Rao; Ralph A Dean; David C Muddiman,Numerous experimental strategies exist for relative protein quantification; one of the primaryobjectives of mass spectrometry based proteomics analysis. These strategies mostly involvethe incorporation of a stable isotope label via either metabolic incorporation in cell or tissueculture (15N/14N metabolic labeling; stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture(SILAC)); chemical derivatization (ICAT; iTRAQ; TMT); or enzymatically catalyzedincorporation (18O labeling). Also; these techniques can be cost or time prohibitive or notamenable to the biological system of interest (ie; metabolic labeling of clinical samples; mostanimals; or fungi). This is the case with the quantification of fungal proteomes; which oftenrequire auxotroph mutants to fully metabolically label. Alternatively; label-free strategies forprotein quantification such as using integrated ion abundance and spectral counting have …,Analytical chemistry,2010,79
Quantitative top-down proteomics of SILAC labeled human embryonic stem cells,Timothy S Collier; Prasenjit Sarkar; Balaji Rao; David C Muddiman,Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are self-renewing pluripotent cells with relevance totreatment of numerous medical conditions. However; a global understanding of the role ofthe hESC proteome in maintaining pluripotency or triggering differentiation is still largelylacking. The emergence of top-down proteomics has facilitated the identification andcharacterization of intact protein forms that are not readily apparent in bottom-up studies.Combined with metabolic labeling techniques such as stable isotope labeling by aminoacids in cell culture (SILAC); quantitative comparison of intact protein expression underdiffering experimental conditions is possible. Herein; quantitative top-down proteomics ofhESCs is demonstrated using the SILAC method and nano-flow reverse phasechromatography directly coupled to a linear-ion-trap Fourier transform ion cyclotron …,Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry,2010,54
Comparison of stable‐isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture and spectral counting for relative quantification of protein expression,Timothy S Collier; Shan M Randall; Prasenjit Sarkar; Balaji M Rao; Ralph A Dean; David C Muddiman,Abstract Protein quantification is one of the principal goals of mass spectrometry (MS)-basedproteomics; and many strategies exist to achieve it. Several approaches involve theincorporation of a stable-isotope label using either chemical derivatization; enzymaticallycatalyzed incorporation of 18 O; or metabolic labeling in a cell or tissue culture. Thesetechniques can be cost or time prohibitive or not amenable to the biological system ofinterest. Label-free techniques including those utilizing integrated ion abundance andspectral counting offer an alternative to stable-isotope-based methodologies. Herein; wepresent the comparison of stable-isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) withspectral counting for the quantification of human embryonic stem cells as they differentiatetoward the trophectoderm at three time points.

Targeted proteomics of the secretory pathway reveals the secretome of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human embryonic stem cells,Prasenjit Sarkar; Shan M Randall; David C Muddiman; Balaji M Rao,Abstract Proteins endogenously secreted by human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) andthose present in hESC culture medium are critical regulators of hESC self-renewal anddifferentiation. Current MS-based approaches for identifying secreted proteins relypredominantly on MS analysis of cell culture supernatants. Here we show that targetedproteomics of secretory pathway organelles is a powerful alternate approach forinterrogating the cellular secretome. We have developed procedures to obtain subcellularfractions from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and hESCs that are enriched in secretorypathway organelles while ensuring retention of the secretory cargo. MS analysis of thesefractions from hESCs cultured in MEF conditioned medium (MEF-CM) or MEFs exposed tohESC medium revealed 99 and 129 proteins putatively secreted by hESCs and MEFs …,Molecular & Cellular Proteomics,2012,18
The subcellular proteome of undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells,Prasenjit Sarkar; Timothy S Collier; Shan M Randall; David C Muddiman; Balaji M Rao,Abstract We have characterized the subcellular proteome of human embryonic stem cells(hESCs) through MS analysis of the membrane; cytosolic; and nuclear fractions; isolatedfrom the same sample of undifferentiated hESCs. Strikingly; 74% of all proteins identifiedwere detected in a single subcellular fraction; we also carried out immunofluorescencestudies to validate the subcellular localization suggested by proteomic analysis; for a subsetof proteins. Our approach resulted in deeper proteome coverage–peptides mapping to 893;2475; and 1185 proteins were identified in the nuclear; cytosolic; and membrane fractions;respectively. Additionally; we used spectral counting to estimate the relative abundance ofall cytosolic proteins. A large number of proteins relevant to hESC biology; including growthfactor receptors; cell junction proteins; transcription factors; chromatin remodeling …,Proteomics,2012,16
Activin/Nodal Signaling Switches the Terminal Fate of Human Embryonic Stem Cell-derived Trophoblasts,Prasenjit Sarkar; Shan M Randall; Timothy S Collier; Anthony Nero; Teal A Russell; David C Muddiman; Balaji M Rao,Background: Specification of terminal fate in trophoblasts derived from human embryonicstem cells is not understood. Results: Inhibition of activin/nodal signaling triggersextravillous fate; but loss of inhibition causes syncytial fate. Conclusion: Activin/nodalsignaling switches the terminal fate of trophoblasts. Significance: We provide a modelsystem that allows for targeted derivation of extravillous trophoblasts andsyncytiotrophoblasts. Abstract Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have been routinelytreated with bone morphogenetic protein and/or inhibitors of activin/nodal signaling to obtaincells that express trophoblast markers. Trophoblasts can terminally differentiate to eitherextravillous trophoblasts or syncytiotrophoblasts. The signaling pathways that govern theterminal fate of these trophoblasts are not understood. We show that activin/nodal …,Journal of Biological Chemistry,2015,12
Molecular aspects of cardiac differentiation in embryonic stem cells,Prasenjit Sarkar; Balaji M Rao,ABSTRACT Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are culture-adapted pluripotent cells derived fromthe inner cell mass of the blastocyst-stage embryo. ESCs provide unique opportunities tostudy the molecular basis of the process of differentiation that gives rise to all the somaticcell types of the body; including cells of the cardiac lineages. Many protocols have beenestablished to obtain cells of the cardiac lineage from ESCs in vitro. More recently; a clearerpicture of the regulatory networks governing cardiac differentiation has begun to emerge.Herein; we summarize the current methods to obtain cells of the cardiac lineages from ESCsand present a review of the signaling pathways; transcription factors; and target genesinvolved in cardiac differentiation.,Critical Reviews™ in Biomedical Engineering,2009,9
Trophoblast differentiation of human embryonic stem cells,Karthik Tiruthani; Prasenjit Sarkar; Balaji Rao,Abstract Molecular mechanisms regulating human trophoblast differentiation remain poorlyunderstood due to difficulties in obtaining primary tissues from very early developmentalstages in humans. Therefore; the use of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as a sourcefor generating trophoblast tissues is of significant interest. Trophoblast-like cells have beenobtained through treatment of hESCs with bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) or inhibitors ofactivin/nodal/transforming growth factor-β signaling; or through protocols involving formationof embryoid bodies (EBs); however; there is controversy over whether hESC-derived cellsare indeed analogous to true trophoblasts found in vivo. In this review; we provide anoverview of previously described efforts to obtain trophoblasts from hESCs. We also discussthe merits and limitations of hESCs as a source of trophoblast derivatives.,Biotechnology journal,2013,7
Identification of epigenetic factor proteins expressed in human embryonic stem cell-derived trophoblasts and in human placental trophoblasts,Prasenjit Sarkar; Adam Mischler; Shan M Randall; Timothy S Collier; Karen F Dorman; Kim A Boggess; David C Muddiman; Balaji M Rao,Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have been used to derive trophoblasts throughdifferentiation in vitro. Intriguingly; mouse ESCs are prevented from differentiation totrophoblasts by certain epigenetic factor proteins such as Dnmt1; thus necessitating thestudy of epigenetic factor proteins during hESC differentiation to trophoblasts. We usedstable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture and quantitative proteomics to studychanges in the nuclear proteome during hESC differentiation to trophoblasts and identifiedchanges in the expression of 30 epigenetic factor proteins. Importantly; the DNAmethyltransferases DNMT1; DNMT3A; and DNMT3B were downregulated. Additionally; wehypothesized that nuclear proteomics of hESC-derived trophoblasts may be used forscreening epigenetic factor proteins expressed by primary trophoblasts in human …,Journal of Proteome Research,2016,2
Role of Signaling Pathways and Epigenetic Factors in Lineage Determination During Human Embryonic Stem Cell Differentiation,Prasenjit Sarkar; Balaji M Rao,Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are culture-adapted cells that were originally derivedfrom the inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst-stage embryo [1]. HESCs are pluripotentcells that can be propagated indefinitely in culture; while retaining the in vivo properties ofICM cells; they can give rise to all tissues of the three germ layers (ectoderm; mesoderm andendoderm). Due to their pluripotency; hESCs have been the subject of intense researchsince they were initially isolated in 1998. HESCs can serve as model systems to study earlyhuman development; in addition to providing a potentially unlimited source of functionaltissues for use in drug evaluation and regenerative medicine. Nevertheless; despite majoradvances; the exact molecular mechanisms that govern the self-renewal and differentiationof hESCs remain unclear. Indeed; a mechanistic understanding of the molecular …,*,2011,1
BMP signaling plays a biphasic role during trophoblast differentiation of human embryonic stem cells,Prasenjit Sarkar; Adam Mischler; Balaji Rao,Objectives: The use of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to develop an in vitro model ofearly TB development has gained significant interest since it was first reported that hESCstreated with bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) differentiate into TB-like cells. Nevertheless;lack of understanding of the mechanistic basis of TB differentiation of hESCs has been amajor impediment for widespread acceptance of hESC-derived TB as a model system forearly human placental development. Therefore; we investigated the role of BMP signaling inTB differentiation of hESCs.,Placenta,2016,*
Trophoblast Differentiation of Human Embryonic Stem Cells,Prasenjit Sarkar,Abstract Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are cell lines isolated from the inner cellmass of the human blastocyst and have the ability to form all the tissues of the human body.However; there is considerable debate as to whether they can form the 'trophoblast'tissues;which are found in the human placenta during pregnancy. Mouse embryonic stem cells areanalogous to hESCs; and do not have the ability to form trophoblast cells. Moreover;currently used approaches for deriving 'trophoblast-like'cells from hESCs suffer fromsignificant limitations. These 'trophoblast-like'cells do not have the important properties thatare otherwise found in the trophoblast cells of the human placenta. There is also ambiguityas to whether these 'trophoblast-like'cells belong to the trophoblast lineage or the mesodermlineage.,*,2013,*
